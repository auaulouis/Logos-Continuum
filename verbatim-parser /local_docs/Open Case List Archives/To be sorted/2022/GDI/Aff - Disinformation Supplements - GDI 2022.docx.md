### Trust Collapse Undermines Democracy

**Collapse of trust risks instability and threatens democracy**

**Thomson-Deveaux, FiveThirtyEight senior writer & Qamar, ABC News
Fellow, 7-8-22**

(Amelia Thomson-Deveaux and Zoha Qamar \[former New York Times Senior
analyst of Market and Growth Analytics\], 7-8-22, FiveThirtyEight,
\"What Happens When Americans Don't Trust Institutions?,\"
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-americans-dont-trust-institutions/,
accessed 7-9-2022) jiu

[Americans are feeling uneasy, and it's hard to blame them. The things
they want to change
--- [inflation](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/17/business/economy/inflation-economy-recession.html), [COVID-19
case
numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/11/this-covid-wave-might-be-the-start-of-our-new-normal-experts-say.html), [rising
violent
crime](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/democrats-crime-gun-violence.html) in
some cities --- seem more and more intractable. There was one big,
abrupt shift in American life at the end of June, when the Supreme
Court [overturned the constitutional right to
abortion](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/roe-v-wade-defined-an-era-the-supreme-court-just-started-a-new-one/).
But that wasn't a change [most Americans
wanted](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/07/06/majority-of-public-disapproves-of-supreme-courts-decision-to-overturn-roe-v-wade/).]{.underline}

[This sense of dissatisfaction showed up in [a recent poll from
Gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/394283/confidence-institutions-down-average-new-low.aspx),
which asked Americans how much confidence they have in various
institutions. The survey found that since last June, when Gallup last
asked this set of questions, Americans' confidence in almost every
institution has dropped]{.underline}. In the poll, which was conducted
before the justices released their decision on abortion but after [a
draft of the opinion
leaked](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473),
the biggest shifts were for the presidency, which saw a
15-percentage-point drop, and the Supreme Court, which saw an 11-point
drop. But [overall, the national mood is sour**. Americans' average
confidence in 14 of the institutions that Gallup asked about was only at
27 percent --- the lowest point since** Gallup began the survey in
**1979.**]{.underline}

[Americans aren't just cynical about their political
institutions]{.underline}. In [Gallup's
trends](https://news.gallup.com/poll/1597/confidence-institutions.aspx),
[you can see **more and more disillusionment with pretty much every
major institution**.]{.underline} Some of these shifts are hard to blame
on politics --- [confidence in banks, for instance, fell
dramatically]{.underline} during the Great Recession. But experts told
me that [they're also the result of increasing partisan polarization and
a [decades-long
effort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/10/12/conservatives-have-long-stoked-distrust-government-now-were-paying-it/) by
the Republican Party to sow distrust in a wide range of government
institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic may have also reinforced Americans'
sense that the government won't be there for them in times of
crisis]{.underline}: According to [a Monmouth University
poll](https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_US_070522/) conducted
from June 23-27, 57 percent of Americans said that the actions of the
federal government over the past six months have hurt their family
regarding the issue most important to them, up from 34 percent in July
2021 and 46 percent in December.

This broad loss of faith in the institutions that organize our society
is dangerous, experts say --- and it may be hard to reverse. "[Despite
the political polarization, both sides feel like they're losing,"
said [Daniel
Drezner](https://fletcher.tufts.edu/people/faculty/daniel-drezner), a
professor of international politics at Tufts University. "And populaces
and countries that are pessimistic about the future often end up doing
really bad things."]{.underline}

[The idea that the government doesn't work for people --- and therefore,
we should have less of it --- can be traced back decades]{.underline},
to the political campaigns of former presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald
Reagan. [Those messages fed a sense of cynicism that was already
growing,]{.underline} according to [Amy
Fried](https://umaine.edu/polisci/faculty-and-staff/amy-fried/), a
political science professor at the University of Maine who has studied
the history of political mistrust. "[Throughout the 1960s and 1970s,
there are all of these upheavals --- **Watergate, the Vietnam War,
riots, assassinations**," she said. But politicians --- mostly
Republicans --- **have since amplified Americans' doubts** by continuing
to talk about government overreach and corruption.]{.underline} Former
President Donald [**Trump dialed up these messages,**
attacking [banks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trumps-convention-further-alienates-wall-street-and-its-money-players/2016/07/19/5872ade8-4dd2-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html),
the [country's](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/18/why-is-donald-trump-attacking-the-us-intelligence-community) [intelligence
agencies](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42360540) and [its
election
system](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-longstanding-history-calling-elections-rigged-doesnt-results/story?id=74126926) during
his campaigns and presidency.]{.underline}

Political allegiances increasingly shape the way Americans view all
kinds of institutions, too. [There are the obvious
ones](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/) ---
[Democrats have more confidence in the presidency when a Democrat is in
the White House, Republicans have more confidence in Congress when the
GOP is in control --- but trust in the medical system, organized
religion and public schools are all shaped by partisanship
too]{.underline}. According to Gallup, between 2021 and 2022[,
Republicans' confidence in the military fell from 81 percent to 71
percent --- a shift that Drezner said could be due to the [botched
withdrawal from Afghanistan last
summer](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/08/31/majority-of-u-s-public-favors-afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-biden-criticized-for-his-handling-of-situation/)]{.underline},
or to a general sense among some conservative voters that even the
military can't be trusted under a Democratic president. "[The culture
wars have become so heavily partisan that they now spill over into
institutions that previously were thought of as not partisan at
all]{.underline}," he said.

[The **[economic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/were-the-stimulus-checks-a-mistake/) and [public
health](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-u-s-still-doesnt-know-how-to-track-a-pandemic/) responses
to the COVID-1**9 pandemic, meanwhile, **may have convinced more
Americans that the government simply doesn't know what it's
doing.**]{.underline} [Katherine
Carman](https://www.rand.org/about/people/c/carman_katherine_grace.html),
a senior economist at the RAND Corporation, was one of the authors of [a
2020
report](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA112-7.html) that
examined why Americans trust institutions in the first place.
"[Competence and honesty --- these are really important factors that
contribute to trust," she said. "We ask the government to make and
enforce laws and policy for us. So we need them to be truthful about the
information they're providing.]{.underline} And we want them to have the
skills and knowledge to actually do those things."

[At the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-trust-the-cdc-on-covid-19-trump-not-so-much/)[,
Americans said they generally trusted the government to handle the
crisis and share accurate information about it. Their confidence in
Trump's response to the pandemic [eroded over the remaining
year](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-coronavirus/trumps-handling-of-coronavirus-pandemic-hits-record-low-approval-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN26T3OF)]{.underline},
but [when Biden came into office, approval of his handling of the
pandemic was pretty high. Now, though]{.underline}, according
to [FiveThirtyEight's approval tracker for presidents\' COVID-19
response](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/), [49
percent of Americans approve of Biden's handling of the pandemic and 43
percent
disapprove]{.underline}.[1](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-happens-when-americans-dont-trust-institutions/#fn-1) And [a
Pew Research Center
poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/biden-starts-year-two-with-diminished-public-support-and-a-daunting-list-of-challenges/) from
earlier this year found that a declining share of Americans are
confident that Biden is able to handle the public health effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic and that he has good judgment on economic policy,
reflecting widespread public concern about rising inflation and a
possible recession.

[These shifts are happening among Americans of all political stripes,
although to different degrees.]{.underline} The Gallup poll found that
Democrats' confidence in the institution of the presidency fell from 69
percent in 2021 to 51 percent this year --- an alarming drop among
members of Biden's own party. That tracks, overall, with [a broader
erosion in Biden's
support](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/democrats-have-been-souring-on-biden-since-last-summer/) among
Democrats, many of whom are disappointed about his administration's lack
of policy achievements and increasingly frustrated about rising costs.

The danger, Carman said, is that [**Americans' trust in institutions
doesn't just decline --- mistrust starts to grow.** Her report found
that there was already active mistrust of the government and media. "I
think that's particularly worrisome," she said. "Active distrust means
not only do you think they're not always honest --- maybe they lie to
you. Maybe they're trying to hurt you]{.underline}."

Widespread distrust can be dangerous. [If people don't trust government
institutions, they'll be more likely to believe that elections are
untrustworthy too. Drezner said that **as distrust increases, people are
more likely to act in** disruptive or even **violent
ways**,]{.underline} like with the Jan. 6 insurrection. If Americans
believe the institutions around them are failing, he said, they "might
be tempted to take a risky gamble that puts you back to where you used
to be."

That's a bleak outlook. But Americans are in a bleak mood. Drezner said
that if some of the trends that are sowing deeper distrust turn around
--- say, the pandemic fades into the background and inflation begins to
abate --- people might start to feel better about the government too.
But for now[, they're not feeling happy about most of the institutions
that order society --- and that could be bad for democracy.]{.underline}

### Trust Collapse Bolsters Partisanship

#### Weakening trust bolsters partisan extremes and risks crises

**Bump, Washington Post National Correspondent, 7-11-22**

(Philip Bump, National correspondent, Washington Post, 7-11-2022,
\"Analysis,\"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/11/sarah-palin-offers-perilous-framing-election-good-vs-evil/,
accessed 7-11-2022) SS:/

[American politics is predicated on the idea that power is
transitory]{.underline}. [Citizens are asked to go to the polls every
two years and decide on national leadership]{.underline}, with all
involved theoretically [recognizing that this might mean a change of
direction]{.underline}. If you're a Democrat wanting to see a Democrat
represent you, you vote for the Democrat and hope she wins. If she
doesn't --- well, there's always two years from now.

You already recognize a way in which this idea has been polluted.
[Partisan redistricting and the pattern of Americans moving into
politically homogeneous communities have meant that there are fewer
places where there are actual transitions between parties]{.underline}.
If you are a Republican in California or a Democrat in Mississippi, you
hold out little hope for being represented in the Senate by a member of
your party.

This is a problem we don't often acknowledge. [I interviewed Princeton
University's Corrine McConnaughy last year, and she expressed concern
about the lack of institutions that let "people feel represented enough,
feel their voice heard enough." Essential to democracy is that people
"understand that losing today is not losing tomorrow." That there is
recourse for changing direction. If people feel as though electoral
politics can't effect change, they look for other mechanisms to do
so.]{.underline}

Now we layer onto this another danger, one exemplified by former Alaska
governor [Sarah Palin]{.underline} at a rally last week. Palin is
running for Alaska's safely Republican House seat and appeared at a
rally with former president Donald Trump. She [cast the election in
stark terms]{.underline}, which in broad strokes isn't atypical for a
candidate. But the phrasing Palin uses was [a moral, existential
one]{.underline}.

"This is life-changing what's coming up here in the midterms, the
changes that are needed," Palin told the cheering audience. "And it's no
longer Democrat versus Republican. [This is all about control versus
freedom.]{.underline}"

Then, a starker contrast: "[It's good versus evil. It is a spiritual
battle]{.underline}."

This is on-brand for Palin. Her arrival on the national political scene
in 2008 was as John McCain's vice-presidential running mate, a selection
made because McCain's team believed she could provide an invigorating
jolt of energy --- and lure further-right, often evangelical voters to
cast a ballot. In the Trump era, evangelical voters became a driving
part of the party's success. Palin, of course, already spoke the
language.

Trump's campaign and presidency were centered on widening fissures
within the country, hewing closely to the demands of his base and
working energetically to score political points against the hated left.
Many evangelicals saw this in religious terms. In early 2019, a poll
found that half of White evangelical Christians believed that God wanted
Trump to be president. He was their overt, unflinching defender --- not
because he shared their beliefs necessarily (though many convinced
themselves he did) but because he understood that rising to the
religious right's defense would bolster his own political position. He
promised to defend them, and he did. In 2016, he won evangelicals by 61
points. In 2020, by 69.

That the country has become more polarized is well documented. Members
of each major political party have viewed the opposition in increasingly
hostile terms over the past 20 years, as measured by the American
National Election Study conducted during each presidential year. [As
recently as 2000, the median "temperature" score granted the other party
by Republicans and Democrats was above 40 out of 100, with lower numbers
indicating "colder" views of the party. In 2020, both parties had
medians under 20.]{.underline}

Again, some of this probably derives from our political isolation. We
often live near those from the opposing party, but we don't necessarily
incorporate them into our lives. Pew Research Center found in the summer
of 2020 that only about 1 in 5 supporters of Trump or Joe Biden had more
than a few friends supporting the other candidate. Four in 10 knew no
one who did.

Such a divide and such skepticism about the opposition make it easier to
cast those other partisans as dangerous or evil, a framing that is
facilitated by the country's increased reliance on partisan media
universes. [Shortly after Biden took office, CBS News published a poll
conducted by YouGov finding that about 4 in 10 Democrats viewed
Republicans not as political opponents but as enemies. More than half of
Republicans said they viewed Democrats as enemies.]{.underline}

Consider how [intertwining religion with politics makes a sense of
political impotence worse.]{.underline} If you think that [you have
little recourse for being heard through the electoral process and you
see your side as fighting on behalf of a divinely motivated
cause]{.underline}? Perilous.

This isn't newly perilous, certainly. In his seminal essay "The Paranoid
Style in American Politics," Richard Hofstadter described right-wing
frustration at a perceived political elite more than a half-century
before the current moment.

"The situation becomes worse when the representatives of a particular
social interest --- perhaps because of the very unrealistic and
unrealizable nature of its demands --- are shut out of the political
process. Having no access to political bargaining or the making of
decisions, they find their original conception that the world of power
is sinister and malicious fully confirmed."

Palin was speaking to an audience about the dangers of leaders who
advocated measures such as mask mandates, something for which many
Americans did, in fact, have no real recourse --- besides, of course,
simply not complying. The mandates were, in fact, often described as
sinister and malicious. In her speech, shortly after the "good versus
evil" bit, Palin called the emergence of the coronavirus the "plandemic"
and suggested that elites wanted to tank the economy.

[The particular problem here is that there will always be a level of
governance over which someone has no control]{.underline}. Even if you
live in Oklahoma, with conservative House members, senators and
state-level officials, Biden is still president. The House and Senate
are still majority-Democratic. [Even if Republicans regain a federal
trifecta, you have little recourse]{.underline} over, say, the
Department of Motor Vehicles. This is the utility of casting government
as an enemy; the opportunities to cast some part of it as despotic are
eternal. To cast it as evil.

Last summer, Pew asked Americans how they felt about leaders from their
own party describing the other party's officials as evil. Most thought
this should not be considered acceptable. Just under half of Republicans
thought the party should be "very" or "somewhat" accepting of such
rhetoric.

[If you convince people that elections are fights between two ends of
the moral plane, the consequences of losing are heightened dramatically.
If you then claim that the election itself was dishonest, that your side
had been "shut out of the political process]{.underline}" (as Hofstadter
put it) [illicitly, you risk crisis.]{.underline}

## Alliances Advantage

### NATO Cooperation Key to Cyber Defense

#### NATO's Cyber Operations Centre requires better collaboration with Allies to deter higher frequency threats.

**Jacobsen, University of Southern Denmark Danish Institute for
International Studies Ph.D. candidate, 21**

(Jeppe T Jacobsen, University of Southern Denmark Danish Institute for
International Studies Ph.D. candidate, Oxford University Press,
5-10-2021, \"Cyber offense in NATO: challenges and opportunities,\"
International Affairs, Volume 97, Issue 3, Pages 704-705, EBSCO,
https://doi.org/10.1093/ia/iiab010, accessed 7-13-2022) SS:/

\*NATO Cyber Operations Centre = CYOC

The article makes three arguments in support of the overall argument
that [NATO will (and should) continue to play only a limited offensive
role in cyberspace]{.underline}. First, it identifies four distinct
cyber effects from the current debates on major cyber incidents
presented in the cyber-conflict literature. This is done in order to
assess the operational challenges and possibilities for successful
integration of sovereign cyber effects in NATO operations, also known as
SCEPVA.8 [As cyber effects are often costly in time and resources to
develop, difficult to predict and verify, and involve a risk of
confliction, it is argued that the types of offensive cyber operations
that are highly destructive and specialized, with a view to enabling
other (kinetic) military effects, are the most difficult to
integrate.]{.underline} In contrast, [less complex disruptions used to
persistently annoy and confuse adversaries hold more
promise.]{.underline} [In order to work in NATO, these effects require
more flexibility in the way CYOC sends requests to and interacts with
the member states.]{.underline}

Second, [in the light of the renewed scholarly attention being given to
NATO's capacity to deter Russia, the article unpacks and assesses the
suggestion that a centre for integrating offensive cyber effects
contributes to NATO's deterrence posture]{.underline}.9 [It assesses the
addition of cyber effects to NATO's operational toolbox in the light of
the (hybrid) threat environment which is currently being articulated in
NATO, and argues that such integration adds little to the existing
deterrence posture]{.underline}. [NATO's superior conventional
capabilities---with or without cyber effects---already threaten
punishment to adversaries who may consider invading allied
countries]{.underline}. [Yet CYOC and the alliance as a whole do not
deter the more frequent (hybrid) cyber activity against member states
that does not reach the threshold of armed conflict.]{.underline}

### Alliance Coop Key to Liberation International Order

#### Alliance cohesion key to global liberal order - the alliance must cooperate or cease to operate

**Carafano, Heritage Foundation Allison Center for Foreign Policy
Studies director & Davis Institute for International Studies vice
president, -78-22**

\[James, 7-8-22, The Heritage Foundation, \"How U.S. Allies Can Engage
Effectively With The Biden Administration\",
https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/commentary/how-us-allies-can-engage-effectively-the-biden-administration accessed
on 7-13-22, hooch//cs\]

How Can U.S. Allies Better Work with America?

From these developments, we can draw some lessons on how America's
allies and partners can engage effectively with the Biden
administration. Interestingly, [it is the kind of approach that will
resonate with American conservatives---even those who are skeptical of
overseas engagement. In short, to get Biden's attention, our allies must
show initiative, suggest concrete action, and demonstrate their own
willingness to put skin in the game and fight.]{.underline}

In the examples above, [both NATO and South Korea showed initiative in
reaching out to the U.S]{.underline}. They didn't just ask for help.
[They brought ideas and initiatives to the table and made the case for
how joint action would serve American interests as well as
theirs]{.underline}.

[When Trump reprised the term "America First," he never meant "America
Alone." Our friends and allies have figured that out]{.underline}. They
now understand [the need to argue why joint action not only advances
grand notions such as "a rules-based order," "advancing shared values,"
or "international norms," but also will be good for every everyday
Americans.]{.underline}

More importantly, [they recognize that partnership entails taking
responsibility and sharing in the burden, risks, and
rewards]{.underline}. In defense of Ukraine, for example, [Estonia has
committed the equivalent of one-third of its annual defense budget to
provide resources for Kyiv.]{.underline} [That gives them street cred in
looking to partner with the U.S]{.underline}. Finland and Sweden want to
join NATO[. The U.S. will support that because they are not looking to
be free riders, but are bringing serious capabilities to the security
table. Their membership serves U.S. interests.]{.underline}

## Prebunking Solvency

### Prebunking Solves Disinformation Narrative

#### Through prebunking, the NATO and its member states have been able to control the narrative in Ukraine

**Tom, intelligence corps officer, 22**

\[Capt Tom, 3-18-2022, Wavell Room, \"How the West is starting to win
the disinformation war » Wavell Room,\",
https://wavellroom.com/2022/03/18/disinformation-russia-nato/, Accessed
7-15-2022, LASA-LR\]

[In the run up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. declassified an
unprecedent amount of intelligence regarding how Putin was going to
justify his actions. While Putin was saying that the buildup of troops
was just an exercise, the U.S. revealed that blood supplies were being
moved up to basing areas; a key indicator that Russia expected to take
casualties.]{.underline} [Before Putin could even begin his 'false flag'
operations, the U.S. revealed that these were a pretext for
invasion]{.underline}. The U.K. got in on the act as well, releasing
intelligence that Russia planned to install a pro-Moscow government in
Kiev. Unfortunately, this intelligence was largely ignored -- and even
ridiculed by the Ukrainian government -- with many Europeans believing
that invasion was not Putin's planned course of action. As we now know,
the intelligence was remarkably accurate.

Despite this, [the releasing of intelligence that preempted Russia's
actions had a significant effect in undermining the narrative that Putin
planned on building; that of a belligerent NATO, an aggressive Ukrainian
government, and a people who needed saving]{.underline}. Ever since
Putin has been struggling to control the narrative around the invasion.
Claims made that Ukraine was close to building a 'dirty bomb', and that
it was planning an offensive operation against the Donbass seem like a
regime scrabbling to retrospectively legitimise its actions, and
failing.

NATO and the West has struggled to control disinformation, particularly
when it's emanated from Russia. Putin was able to dictate the narrative
around his use of 'little green men' in Crimea in 2014 and exploit US
political divisions to cover his interference in the 2016 U.S.
Presidential elections. [However, the use of classified intelligence to
'prebunk' Russian disinformation in Ukraine demonstrates a tool that the
West and NATO can exploit to get ahead in the disinformation
fight.]{.underline} But for this to be effective it will not only
require the sharing of intelligence with the public to become more
widespread, but a change in how intelligence agencies operate.

#### Prebunking is based on intelligence with high visibility

**Myre, NPR National Security Correspondent, 22**

(Greg Myre, NPR national security correspondent with a focus on the
intelligence community, NPR, 2-8-2022, \"As Russia threatens Ukraine,

The Biden administration says it doesn\'t know whether Russian leader
Vladimir Putin will invade Ukraine with the more than 100,000 troops
he\'s amassed near their shared border.

But [Biden\'s national security team says a Russian disinformation
campaign is already well underway]{.underline}. Pentagon spokesman John
Kirby recently outlined what he described as a Russian plan to create a
phony video that could be used as a pretext for a Russian invasion.

\"As part of this fake attack, we believe that Russia would produce a
very graphic propaganda video, which would include corpses, and actors
that would be depicting mourners.\"

[In a similar vein, Britain recently announced that Russia might try to
stage a coup in Ukraine and install a leader friendly to the Kremlin ---
who could then \"invite\" Russian troops into the country.]{.underline}

U.S. claims face some skepticism

The U.S. and British governments have presented this information without
offering proof. They say they can\'t reveal their sources and methods
for obtaining it.

This has led to some skepticism. Critics note the U.S. failed to predict
the rapid collapse of the Afghan government last year. And the U.S.
invaded Iraq in 2003 on the false premise that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

\"I know that [a lot of people will intuitively, instinctively

He thinks [the U.S. and Britain have provided enough information to make
their case in this instance]{.underline}.

\"It appears that [the U.S. intelligence community, with the United
Kingdom and others, have very good visibility into Russian planning,
because otherwise they wouldn\'t be able to reveal those

accessed 7-15-2022) SS:/

White House officials have been using a powerful psychological technique
to combat Russian disinformation.

They're calling it out in advance.

As early as December, they began warning that Moscow might invent
provocations to justify an invasion of Ukraine. A month later, they
predicted a "false flag" operation and gave specifics: Russia had sent
saboteurs into Ukraine and was planning to release a staged video of
fake Ukrainian atrocities. When the video finally appeared, it fell
flat. In fact, it was quickly recognized as propaganda and ridiculed as
"dumb." That's how you combat disinformation.

[White House]{.underline} press secretary Jen Psaki went on to clarify
the administration's approach: "We've [made a]{.underline} decision ---
a [strategic decision --- to call out disinformation when we see
it.]{.underline} [We are much more cognizant of the Russian
disinformation machine than we were in 2014]{.underline}. Russia has a
boundless capacity to misrepresent truth."

[Because President Joe Biden's team was proactive, Vladimir Putin's lies
gained almost no traction, and the civilized world stands in near
universal opposition to Russia's aggression in Ukraine.]{.underline} The
importance of this accomplishment should not be underestimated. In a
recent webinar hosted by American Purpose magazine, retired U.S. Army
officer and strategy analyst Ben Hodges described Biden's handling of
the situation as brilliant. He went on to predict that "people are going
to be studying this for a long time."

Maybe so, but [experts on disinformation have studied similar techniques
for almost 60 years]{.underline}. Early researchers called it
"mind-inoculation." Today, many call the strategy "[prebunking." It's a
way to prevent false narratives from sinking roots into people's minds
--- and guard against the more challenging salvage operation of
"debunking" them later.]{.underline}

[The Kremlin's use of disinformation is not limited to military
campaigns. Before Biden took office, Russian intelligence operatives
propagated the wacky theory that Western COVID-19 vaccines would contain
microchips. They pushed it out to one of their English language
propaganda arms, and a month later, a CBS poll indicated that 44% of
Republican voters believed it to be true.]{.underline}

We can draw important lessons from this. First, human beings can be
astonishingly gullible; our susceptibility to nonsense is nearly
bottomless. Second, we have to be proactive about combatting
disinformation. Think about it: If Donald Trump had taken on Russian
COVID-19 disinformation the way Biden took on Russian disinformation
about Ukraine, hundreds of thousands of Americans might still be alive
today.

Third, our brave new digital world gives bad actors unprecedented power
to exploit vulnerable minds. Russian propagandists, domestic conspiracy
theorists, demagogic politicians, cult leaders, peddlers of quack cures
--- our world is now teeming with people skilled at disrupting higher
brain function. Scientists call it "amygdala hijacking" --- the use of
fear to sow division, stoke resentments, win followings and manufacture
cynicism.

If the situation feels out of control, take heart. Scientists like
Stephan Lewandowsky, Sander van der Linden and John Cook have been
studying solutions. Their research suggests that [prebunking is
massively underutilized. We could be using it to combat climate denial,
vaccine resistance, QAnonsense, political polarization and
more.]{.underline}

Our own work, as researchers at the Cognitive Immunology Research
Collaborative, suggests that prebunking is just the tip of a very large
iceberg. In fact, there are many ways to boost "mental immune function"
and thereby reduce susceptibility to bad information. It's time we took
a more systematic approach to fortifying minds against malicious
influence. Cognitive immunology --- the science of mental immunity ---
points the way.

Disinformation is insidious. Like biological weaponry, it releases
infectious agents that spread corruption among the susceptible. With
internet connectivity as a vector of transmission, the threat to our way
of life is profound.

To many, Trump's claims about the 2020 election looks like nothing more
than the complaints of a sore loser. But [by spreading allegations about
rigged voting machines, corrupt election officials, bamboo ballots and
more, Trump and his allies might be laying the groundwork for things
they might do if they don't like the results in 2024.]{.underline}

[Will the Biden White House employ its new strategy of prebunking to
combat Trump disinformation too]{.underline}? [If they wait until
election season, it may be too late.]{.underline}

[In the meantime, there's still plenty of disinformation out there about
Ukraine to keep the debunkers busy]{.underline}, such as fake photos on
social media (with some images even taken from video games) and lies
about the Ukrainian president having already fled Kyiv or raised the
white flag.

In the future, once people become more aware of the prevalence of
disinformation and the power of prebunking, it will be possible to head
off some of this nonsense before it starts, by making people more
skeptical of what they see and hear and building up their mental
immunity in advance.

Reactive response to new information realities

increased spending on information dissemination, the international
response was fast and unified with many tech companies and social media
platforms increasing efforts to highlight and remove malicious
information actors.]{.underline}

Fact-checking and debunking organizations ramped up their operations and
[the UK and Australia explicitly asked social networks to block Russia
state-linked services and content providers]{.underline}. [The European
Union (EU) and the UK banned both Sputnik and RT]{.underline}, and
[Canada announced increased funding for the G7's Rapid Response
Mechanism]{.underline}, [which was created to respond to threats from
foreign actors 'seeking to undermine democratic societies and

[International responses to Russia's malign information tactics are

and a heightened awareness of the nature of the problem.]{.underline}

react to new information realities -- changing narratives, target

### Disinfo Meets Cyber

#### Disinformation is a cybersecurity issue

**United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission, 21**

\[December 2021, Cyberspace Solarium Commission, "COUNTERING
DISINFORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES, CSC White Paper #6,"
<https://www.solarium.gov/public-communications/disinformation-white-paper>,
p. 4, accessed 7-12-22\]

[INTRODUCTION -- WHY DISINFORMATION IS A CYBERSPACE ISSUE]{.underline}

[The United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) was created by
Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal
Year 2019 to answer two fundamental questions: What strategic approach
will defend the United States against cyberattacks of significant
consequences? And what policies and legislation are required to
implement that strategy? While disinformation is considered by some an
issue largely separate from cybersecurity]{.underline} or network
security,1 the Commission addressed disinformation in the very narrow
context of elections in its final report in March 2020. As the COVID-19
pandemic swept across the globe, [the Commission revisited the issue,
this time in the context of disinformation about the pandemic itself,
noting, "Our adversaries' disinformation campaigns focused on the
pandemic illustrate that disinformation activities can reach far beyond
the political and electoral contexts]{.underline} with which Americans
are best acquainted."2

Over the course of the intervening months, [the Commission received
demand signals from constituents within Congress and the executive
branch to treat the topic of disinformation and potential policy
recommendations more extensively]{.underline}. The Commission has
previously been reluctant to delve deeply into the topic of
disinformation for two reasons.

First, disinformation as a policy issue, unlike many aspects of
cybersecurity policy, has been marked by a strong partisan divide.
Researchers have identified an association between strong partisanship
and vulnerability to misinformation;3 more than two-thirds of U.S.
citizens believe that Republicans and Democrats disagree about basic
facts;4 and while U.S. citizens in both major parties agree that
disinformation is a problem, they disagree about who is responsible for
it and what ways to tackle the threat are appropriate.5 Although this
partisan divide persists today, it is the sense of the members of the
Commission that there is room to reach some agreement on core issues.

Second, as noted above, [disinformation is seen by many as]{.underline}
an issue largely [separate from cybersecurity]{.underline} and cyber
policy in the United States. While the Commission understands this
view[, continuing to bifurcate these issues has become untenable. From a
strategic perspective, the United States and its policymakers do
themselves a disservice by continuing to differentiate between the two
when our adversaries do not.6]{.underline}

In order to craft a comprehensive strategy to defend the United States
from cyberattacks of significant consequence, [policy-makers must
account for the entire arsenal employed by adversaries to cause harm in
cyberspace, including information. It]{.underline} is also important to
take a more operational or risk management perspective: [disinformation
campaigns waged against the United States]{.underline} by foreign actors
[are often carried out]{.underline} by many of the same threat actors as
are active [in cyberspace and are often the consequence of
cyberattacks]{.underline}.

For these reasons, members of the Commission believe that elements of
the topic of disinformation are within our mandate[. This white paper is
the result of deep research, interviews with experts, and deliberations
by the Commission. It]{.underline} seeks to explain how the Commission's
proposed strategy of layered cyber deterrence applies to combating
disinformation and contributes a set of policy recommendations to better
position the United States to prevent, counter, and withstand the
consequences of disinformation launched against it.

#### Countering disinformation [is]{.underline} cybersecurity\-\--terrain, tactics, targets, and temptations prove. The EU votes aff.

**EU DisinfoLab, 21**

\[5-24-21, This paper provides feedback from the EU DisinfoLab on the
EU's updated cybersecurity strategy, the Joint Communication on the EU's
Cybersecurity Strategy for the Digital Decade (16 Dec 2020) and is
developed based on our experience conducting investigations into
sophisticated disinformation campaigns run by state and non-state backed
actors, recent publications, and ongoing discussions with public
authorities and civil society partners in the European Union (EU), the
UK, and the US, on how to counter the evolving threat., EU Disinfo Lab,
"Why Disinformation is a Cybersecurity Threat,"
<https://www.disinfo.eu/advocacy/why-disinformation-is-a-cybersecurity-threat/>,
accessed 7-12-22\]

[Context: Why Disinformation is a Cybersecurity Issue]{.underline}

[Drawing on our research into coordinated disinformation campaigns and
our own experience as an NGO in the field, we wish to highlight four
areas of convergence between disinformation and cybersecurity of
relevance to EU policymakers: the "terrain" on which disinformation is
distributed (the social web and the internet stack, networking
infrastructure, routing services), the "tactics" that increasingly
combine disinformation as part of the cyberattack delivery package, the
"targets" leading to victims of cyberattacks simultaneously being victim
of disinformation, and what we could call the "temptation", ie. the
lucrative possibility of both disinformation campaigns and
cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[Terrain: While there is much focus on disinformation across major
social media platforms, disinformation is an inherently distributed
phenomenon. Disinformation campaigns continue to make use of networking
infrastructure and routing services, leveraging different levels of the
internet stack. As EU DisinfoLab's  recent investigations have
demonstrated, social media platforms often serve as gateways and
amplifiers of disinformation websites. In this way, disinformation and
cybersecurity implicate many of the same members of the private sector
and the internet technical community. ]{.underline}

[Tactics: There is significant overlap between disinformation and
cybersecurity regarding the tools and methods of attack. Disinformation
is increasingly part of the cyberattack delivery package, used to
deliver malware by manipulating people's fears and heightened
emotions]{.underline} (for instance the deployment of "fearware", a
subset of phishing lures that rose in prominence during the pandemic and
rely on anxieties and informational deficits). The continuous
proliferation of hack and leak operations as well as the coordination
between hybrid tactics (illustrated in the Sandworm case) demonstrates
this convergence. There is also significant convergence between
disinformation campaigns and the  tactics used in cybercrime, for
example, via illegal dark web transactions, illegally obtained
documents, and various kinds of fraud.

[Targets: Disinformation campaigns and cyberattacks can cause similar
harms and are sometimes combined to reach the same targets. While a data
breach can compromise information security, so can the manipulation of
data.]{.underline} We saw an example of this related to Covid-19
vaccines early this year, when hackers stole confidential documents from
the European Medicines Agency (EMA) a European Union regulatory body to 
seow mistrust in the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Meanwhile, so-called
"anti-democracy attacks" and "cyber influencing attacks" like media
manipulation and astroturfing in the context of elections illustrate the
hybrid nature of interference in democratic processes. 

[Temptations: Hacking, cybercrime and influence operations are lucrative
endeavors, often outsourced to skilled professionals. While individuals
and businesses may have increased their readiness for ransomware
attacks, disinformation strategies like defamation and extortion are now
being used to cause reputational damage and seek profit.]{.underline}
These activities all have strong financial incentives and as yet
insufficient consequences, due in part to the challenges of attribution
but also to the lack of dissuasive/restrictive measures. 

### Cyber Includes Protecting Info Systems

#### US and NATO definitions included protection information

[For definitional clarity, we have relied on the U.S. National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST) definition of cyberspace, the
interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, which
includes the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems,
and embedded processors and controllers]{.underline}...."
[**Cybersecurity** has been defined as "the activity or process, ability
or capability, or state whereby information and communications systems
and the information contained therein are protected from and/or defended
against damage, unauthorized use or modification or
exploitation]{.underline}." That basic definition shapes what we have
included throughout this document.

#### Experts say disinformation is cybersecurity

Threats", <https://www.mdpi.com/2306-5729/7/4/49/pdf,> p. 1-2, accessed
7-17-22\]

[According to a report by the Institute for Public Relations, 63% of
Americans view disinformation as a major problem in society, yet there
are limited avenues to combat it outside of media literacy and news
spaces \[1\]. similarly, a report by Neustar International Security
Council (NISC) found that 48% of cybersecurity professionals think of
disinformation as a threat, of which 49% say the threat is very
significant. The study also found that 91% of cybersecurity
professionals thought that stricter measures should be implemented on
the Internet]{.underline} \[2\]. The gravity of the impact of
disinformation on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
information makes it necessary to view disinformation not simply as an
error of information but as a form of cyberattack.

[Cybersecurity relates to the protection and defense of personal
information, computer systems, and critical infrastructure. Cyber
threats tend to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of technology systems. Disinformation, the sharing of
deliberately misleading or biased information, has been formally
classified as an information disorder by the Council of
Europe]{.underline} (2017) \[3\]. The goal of disinformation is to
change an individual's thoughts and behaviors, consequently influencing
public opinion by altering one's view of reality or accentuating one's
prior held beliefs to disrupt truth-seeking[. Deceptive information can
leave people confused about basic facts and current events, creating a
dangerous situation affecting public safety, organizational reputations,
or governmental functions. In many ways, disinformation is thus similar
to a cyberattack, where instead of compromising a computer system, it
compromises our cognitive abilities. Such disruptions have been coined
cognitive hacking---where such practices can result in a greater threat
than a cyberattack on critical infrastructure]{.underline} \[4\]. [The
damage caused by disinformation can be challenging to repair, as people
form opinions based on cognitive and confirmation biases. The deceptive
nature of disinformation is further accentuated by economic pressures
and advertisement-centric models that incentivize disinformation to
overload information channels, often drowning the truth. Just as
technology and social media expansion increase cybersecurity risks, they
exacerbate the impact of disinformation.]{.underline}

### US Key to Solve

#### US is key -- US experience, expertise, and capabilities are unmatched

Distinguished Visiting Professor, 17**

\[Martin C., Spring 2017, "The Convergence of Information Warfare,"

p. 61-62, accessed 7-15-22\]

The Future of US Information Warfare

Given the trends and convergence of information warfare, how might the
United States exploit these trends? On the face of it[, no country is
better positioned to carry out information war. US skills at cyberwar
have no equal. US institutions lead the world in the commercialized arts
of persuasion, and the collection and analysis of personal information
for commercial and political purposes have proceeded farther in the
United States than anywhere else. No country is more advanced in
digitizing and networking things. US expertise in systems integration is
unchallenged.]{.underline} But figuring out how to effectively harass
another country\'s citizens one at a time does not seem like an urgent
or important, much less permissible, US national security problem to
solve.

Nevertheless, [because other countries are interested in figuring out
how to combine these elements of information warfare into a unified
whole, the United States ought to understand how to do so itself. First,
there may be useful techniques learned]{.underline} even if the larger
idea is unacceptable. Second, even though the prospect of operating a
harassment campaign based on IW is unpalatable, one cannot rule out
occasions in which the only way to stop others from doing so (short of
armed conflict) may be a credible offensive capability. Third, just as
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was established shortly
after Sputnik launched for the purposes of preventing surprise- -and
then went ahead to develop technology that surprised others- dabbling in
the arts of IW could help prevent external developments from surprising
the United States.

[If the United States were to embed cyber operations within a broader
context of IW, then the mission and organization of US Cyber Command
would have to change. Today it boggles the mind to ask an organization
(deservedly) wrapped in great secrecy to take the lead for influence
operations, which are ineluctably public. But in time, the choice to
overlook the psychological effects of cyber operations or the potential
synergy between psychological operations and cyber operations would make
just as little sense.25 Serious thought may be needed on how to build an
information warfare authority, whether housed under one organization or
achieved through intense coordination among the various communities:
cyber warriors, cyber intelligence collectors, electronic warriors,
psychological operators, and, in some cases, special
operators.]{.underline}

Perceptions of cyberwar might also need rethinking. One could debate the
plausibility of a determined cyber attack campaign unaccompanied by
violence. However, [it is harder to imagine a cyber attack campaign
unaccompanied by other elements of information warfare, in large part
because almost all situations where cyber attacks are useful are also
those which offer no good reason not to use other elements of
IW]{.underline}. For instance, if another country is trying to exhaust
US will by conducting cyber attacks on information systems that underlie
US commerce, they would not necessarily try to blow up trucks. Rather,
cyber attacks that compromise trucks, to reduce confidence in their safe
operation, are more plausible, if achievable. It is also quite likely
that in a systematic campaign, attackers would try to jam GPS or
override satellite uplinks, using cyber espionage to create the
impression that they are watching Americans and are prepared to dox
particular individuals, or letting a thousand trolls bloom to create a
news environment that would pit Americans against each other. The latter
activities have attributes of nonlethality, unpredictability, ambiguity,
and persistence that allow them to fit the strategic niche occupied by
cyber attacks. [Preparations to retain resilience and accelerate
recovery after a cyber attack campaign would also do well to address the
complications that could arise if other elements of IW]{.underline} were
used in conjunction with cyber attacks.

**[The U.K. government has announced new measures to crack down on the
spread of false COVID-19 information online, including implementing
dedicated specialist units to tackle misinformation.]{.underline}**

The new rapid response unit will operate from inside the U.K.'s Cabinet
Office and will look at ways to counter "harmful narratives" on the
internet --- addressing the scourge of "experts" issuing false and
harmful misinformation, as well as fraudsters operating phishing scams.

"We need people to follow expert medical advice and stay at home,
protect the NHS \[National Health Service\], and save lives," U.K.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement. ["It is vital that
this message hits home and that misinformation and disinformation which
undermines it is knocked down quickly."]{.underline}

Disinformation and "fake news" are major blights on 21st-century
society, enabled by ubiquitous connectivity that delivers deceptive
information directly to people's pockets 24/7. We've already seen how
social media can be abused to further political agendas, and over the
past few months a similar trend has emerged with the COVID-19 outbreak.

[Earlier this year, the World Health Organization (WHO) referred to the
issue as a massive "infodemic."]{.underline} The WHO characterized this
as an "over-abundance of information --- some accurate and some not ---
that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable
guidance when they need it" in a report published in February. In
response, social media companies have attempted to separate fact from
fiction, with Twitter deleting COVID-19 misinformation that could cause
physical harm and Facebook launching a new Messenger hub to highlight
ways users can identify false or misleading information about the virus.

[Dowden said the U.K. government is working directly with technology
companies to step up these efforts.]{.underline}

"We're working with social media companies, and I'll be pressing them
this week for further action to stem the spread of falsehoods and rumors
\[that\] could cost lives," he said.

False claims of potential vaccines and far-fetched notions that avoiding
cold or spicy foods can help prevent the spread of COVID-19 have been
shared widely across social media over the past few months. "Miracle
cures" such as rinsing your mouth with a saline solution or drinking
bleach have also reared their heads.

**[The U.K. government said it is already identifying up to 70 incidents
each week involving "false narratives" with multiple misleading claims,
and its Rapid Response Unit will work to address any false claims that
gain traction by issuing rebuttals on social media, asking platforms to
remove the offending content, and promoting legitimate public health
campaigns through "reliable sources."]{.underline}**

[Over the past decade, the "cult of irrelevance" in political
science]{.underline} scholarship [has been lamented by a growing
chorus]{.underline} (Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009). [Prominent
scholars]{.underline} of international affairs [have
diagnosed]{.underline} the roots of [the gap]{.underline} between
academia and policymaking, [made the case for why]{.underline} political
science [research is valuable for policymaking]{.underline}, [and
offered]{.underline} a number of [ideas]{.underline} for enhancing the
policy relevance of scholarship in international relations and
comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead 2010; Van Evera 2010;
Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and Desch 2014). Building
on these insights, [several initiatives have been formed]{.underline} in
the attempt to "bridge the gap."2 [Many]{.underline} of the specific
efforts put in place by these projects [focus on providing scholars with
the skills, platforms, and networks to better communicate]{.underline}
the [findings and implications]{.underline} of their research [to the
policymaking community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile
objective for a field in which theoretical debates, methodological
training, and publishing norms tend more and more toward the abstract
and esoteric.¶

[Yet enhancing communication]{.underline} between scholars and
policymakers [is only one component]{.underline} of bridging the gap
between international affairs theory and practice. [Another]{.underline}
crucial component of this bridge [is the **generation of substantive
research programs that are actually policy relevant**]{.underline}---a
challenge to which less concerted attention has been paid. The dual
challenges of bridging the gap are especially acute for graduate
students, a particular irony since many enter the discipline with the
explicit hope of informing policy. [In a field that has an admirable
devotion to pedagogical self-reflection]{.underline}, **[strikingly
little attention is paid to techniques for generating policy-relevant
ideas]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} dissertation and other [research
topics]{.underline}. Although numerous articles and conference workshops
are devoted to the importance of experiential and problem-based
learning, especially through techniques of simulation that emulate
policymaking processes (Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012;
Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014), little has been written about the use of
such techniques for generating and developing innovative research
ideas.¶

[This article outlines an experiential and problem-based approach
to]{.underline} developing a [political science research]{.underline}
program [using scenario analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on
illuminating the research generation and pedagogical benefits of this
technique by describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era
Foreign Policy Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral
students of international and comparative affairs who share a
demonstrated interest in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the
introductory section, the article outlines the practice of scenario
analysis and considers the utility of the technique in political
science. We argue that scenario analysis should be viewed as a tool to
stimulate problem-based learning for doctoral students and discuss the
broader scholarly benefits of using scenarios to help generate research
ideas. The second section details the manner in which NEFPC deploys
scenario analysis. The third section reflects upon some of the concrete
scholarly benefits that have been realized from the scenario format. The
fourth section offers insights on the pedagogical potential associated
with using scenarios in the classroom across levels of study. A brief
conclusion reflects on the importance of developing specific techniques
to aid those who wish to generate political science scholarship of
relevance to the policy world.¶

What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science?¶

[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[Scenario analysis is thus **typically seen as serving the purposes of
corporate planning or as a policy tool**]{.underline} to be used in
combination with simulations of decision making. **[Yet scenario
analysis is not inherently limited to these uses]{.underline}**. [This
section]{.underline} provides a brief overview of the practice of
scenario analysis and the motivations underpinning its uses. It then
[makes a case for the utility of the technique for political science
scholarship]{.underline} and describes how the scenarios deployed at
NEFPC were created.¶

The Art of Scenario Analysis¶

[We characterize scenario analysis as the art of juxtaposing current
trends in unexpected combinations in order to **articulate surprising
and yet plausible futures**]{.underline}, often **[referred to as
"alternative worlds."]{.underline}** [Scenarios are]{.underline} thus
**[explicitly not forecasts or projections based on linear
extrapolations of contemporary patterns]{.underline}**, [and they are
**not hypothesis-based expert predictions**]{.underline}. [**Nor should
they be equated with simulations**, which are]{.underline} best
characterized as [functional representations of **real institutions** or
decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[Instead, they are
depictions of possible future states of the world]{.underline}**,
offered **[together with a narrative of the driving causal
forces]{.underline}** and potential exogenous shocks **[that could lead
to those futures]{.underline}**. Good scenarios thus rely on explicit
causal propositions that, independent of one another, are
plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way.¶

While scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic
planning during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary
practice are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and
early 1970s (Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially
initiated at Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the
usual forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector.¶ Building
on its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013).¶

[Several features make scenario analysis particularly useful for
policymaking]{.underline}.5 [Long-term global trends across a number of
different realms]{.underline}---social, technological, environmental,
economic, and political---[combine in often-unexpected ways to produce
unforeseen challenges]{.underline}. [Yet the ability of decision makers
to imagine, let alone prepare for, discontinuities]{.underline} in the
policy realm [is constrained by their existing mental models and
maps]{.underline}. [This limitation is exacerbated by **well-known
cognitive bias tendencies such as groupthink and confirmation
bias**]{.underline} (Jervis 1976; Janis 1982; Tetlock 2005). [The power
of scenarios lies in their ability to help individuals **break out of
conventional modes of thinking** and analysis by introducing unusual
combinations of trends and deliberate discontinuities in narratives
about the future]{.underline}. **[Imagining alternative future worlds
through a structured analytical process enables policymakers to envision
and thereby adapt to something altogether different from the known
present]{.underline}**.¶

Designing Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry¶

The characteristics of scenario analysis that commend its use to
policymakers also make it well suited to helping political scientists
generate and develop policy-relevant research programs. [Scenarios are
essentially textured, plausible, and relevant stories that help us
imagine how the future]{.underline} political-economic world [could be
different from the past]{.underline} in a manner that highlights policy
challenges and opportunities. For example, terrorist organizations are a
known threat that have captured the attention of the policy community,
yet our responses to them tend to be linear and reactive. Scenarios that
explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of change---the rise of a new
peer competitor in the East that diverts strategic attention, volatile
commodity prices that empower and disempower various state and nonstate
actors in surprising ways, and the destabilizing effects of climate
change or infectious disease pandemics---can be useful for illuminating
the nature and limits of the terrorist threat in ways that may be missed
by a narrower focus on recognized states and groups. By illuminating the
potential strategic significance of specific and yet poorly understood
opportunities and threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial
gaps in our collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends
and dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social
science scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality
itself. [Very simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief
often-overlooked yet pressing questions in international affairs that
demand focused investigation]{.underline}.¶

[Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in principle, [an innovative tool
for developing a political science research agenda]{.underline}. In
practice, [achieving this objective requires careful tailoring of the
approach]{.underline}. The specific scenario analysis technique we
outline below was designed and refined to provide a structured
experiential process for generating problem-based research questions
with contemporary international policy relevance.6 The first step in the
process of creating the scenario set described here was to identify
important causal forces in contemporary global affairs. Consensus was
not the goal; on the contrary, some of these causal statements
represented competing theories about global change (e.g., a resurgence
of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing forces). A major
principle underpinning the transformation of these causal drivers into
possible future worlds was to "simplify, then exaggerate" them, before
fleshing out the emerging story with more details.7 Thus, the contours
of the future world were drawn first in the scenario, with details about
the possible pathways to that point filled in second. It is entirely
possible, indeed probable, that some of the causal claims that turned
into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so much as to be implausible,
and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our own form of groupthink
went into construction of the scenarios. One of the great strengths of
scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario discussions themselves,
as described below, lay bare these especially implausible claims and
systematic biases.8¶ An explicit methodological approach underlies the
written scenarios themselves as well as the analytical process around
them---that of case-centered, structured, focused comparison, intended
especially to shed light on new causal mechanisms (George and Bennett
2005). [The use of scenarios is similar to counterfactual analysis in
that it modifies certain variables in a given situation in order to
analyze the resulting effects]{.underline} (Fearon 1991). [Whereas
counterfactuals are traditionally retrospective]{.underline} in nature
and explore events that did not actually occur in the context of known
history, our **[scenarios are deliberately
forward-looking]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} are [designed to
**explore potential futures**]{.underline} that could unfold. As such,
counterfactual analysis is especially well suited to identifying how
individual events might expand or shift the "funnel of choices"
available to political actors and thus lead to different historical
outcomes (Nye 2005, 68--69), while forward-looking scenario analysis can
better illuminate surprising intersections and sociopolitical dynamics
without the perceptual constraints imposed by fine-grained historical
knowledge. [We see scenarios as a complementary resource for exploring
these dynamics in international affairs, rather than as a
replacement]{.underline} for counterfactual analysis, historical case
studies, or other methodological tools.¶

In the scenario process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios
are employed, acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario,
as detailed below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which
represent hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in
evolving international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself
employs templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas.¶

[The scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance.¶

[The scenario approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the
belief that these traditional approaches can be complemented by
identifying questions likely to be of great empirical importance in the
real world, even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles
[**in existing research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [scenarios]{.underline} analyzed at NEFPC
[envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium (five to
seven year) term and are designed to **tease out issues scholars and
policymakers may encounter in the relatively near future**]{.underline}
[so that they can **begin thinking critically about them
now**]{.underline}. [This timeframe offers a period distant enough from
the present as to avoid falling into current events analysis, but not so
far into the future as to seem like science fiction]{.underline}. In
imagining the worlds in which these scenarios might come to pass,
[participants **learn strategies for avoiding failures of creativity**
and for **overturning the assumptions that prevent scholars and analysts
from anticipating and understanding** the pivotal junctures that arise
in international affairs.]{.underline}

## Disad Answers

### Politics -- Countering Disinformation Politically Popular

#### Addressing disinformation in the cybersecurity context is politically popular

**United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission, 21**

\[December 2021, Cyberspace Solarium Commission, "COUNTERING
DISINFORMATION IN THE UNITED STATES, CSC White Paper #6,"
<https://www.solarium.gov/public-communications/disinformation-white-paper>,
p. 4, accessed 7-12-22\]

[INTRODUCTION -- WHY DISINFORMATION IS A CYBERSPACE ISSUE]{.underline}

[The United States Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) was created by
Congress in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal
Year 2019 to answer two fundamental questions: What strategic approach
will defend the United States against cyberattacks of significant
consequences? And what policies and legislation are required to
implement that strategy? While disinformation is considered by some an
issue largely separate from cybersecurity]{.underline} or network
security,1 the Commission addressed disinformation in the very narrow
context of elections in its final report in March 2020. As the COVID-19
pandemic swept across the globe, [the Commission revisited the issue,
this time in the context of disinformation about the pandemic itself,
noting, "Our adversaries' disinformation campaigns focused on the
pandemic illustrate that disinformation activities can reach far beyond
the political and electoral contexts]{.underline} with which Americans
are best acquainted."2

**[Over the course of the intervening months, the Commission received
demand signals from constituents within Congress and the executive
branch to treat the topic of disinformation and potential policy
recommendations more extensively.]{.underline}** The Commission has
previously been reluctant to delve deeply into the topic of
disinformation for two reasons.

First, disinformation as a policy issue, unlike many aspects of
cybersecurity policy, has been marked by a strong partisan divide.
Researchers have identified an association between strong partisanship
and vulnerability to misinformation;3 more than two-thirds of U.S.
citizens believe that Republicans and Democrats disagree about basic
facts;4 and while U.S. citizens in both major parties agree that
disinformation is a problem, they disagree about who is responsible for
it and what ways to tackle the threat are appropriate.5 [Although this
partisan divide persists today, it is the sense of the members of the
Commission that there is room to reach some agreement on core
issues.]{.underline}

Second, as noted above, [disinformation is seen by many as]{.underline}
an issue largely [separate from cybersecurity]{.underline} and cyber
policy in the United States. While the Commission understands this
view[, continuing to bifurcate these issues has become untenable. From a
strategic perspective, the United States and its policymakers do
themselves a disservice by continuing to differentiate between the two
when our adversaries do not.6]{.underline}

[In order to craft a comprehensive strategy to defend the United States
from cyberattacks of significant consequence, policy-makers must account
for the entire arsenal employed by adversaries to cause harm in
cyberspace, including information. It is also important to take a more
operational or risk management perspective: disinformation campaigns
waged against the United States by foreign actors are often carried out
by many of the same threat actors as are active in cyberspace and are
often the consequence of cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[For these reasons, members of the Commission believe that elements of
the topic of disinformation are within our mandate.]{.underline} This
white paper is the result of deep research, interviews with experts, and
deliberations by the Commission. It seeks to explain how the
Commission's proposed strategy of layered cyber deterrence applies to
combating disinformation and contributes a set of policy recommendations
to better position the United States to prevent, counter, and withstand
the consequences of disinformation launched against it.
