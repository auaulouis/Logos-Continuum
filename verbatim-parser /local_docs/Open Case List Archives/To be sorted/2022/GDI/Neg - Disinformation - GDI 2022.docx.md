### Russian Disinfo Will Fail

#### The plan is not key - multiple reasons Russian disinfo will fail in the status quo

**Tucker, New York University Jordan Center for Advanced Study of
Russia, director, 22 **

\[Joshua A, 4-12-22, Slate, \"The People Who Believe Russia's
Disinformation\",
[https://slate.com/technology/2022/04/russia-disinformation-china-africa-latin-america.html
accessed on
6-27-22](https://slate.com/technology/2022/04/russia-disinformation-china-africa-latin-america.html%20accessed%20on%206-27-2022)
hooch//cs\]

[As the information war rages on, we're left wondering what will happen
next. Will Russia's propaganda campaign continue to work on its citizens
and others? Or will the lies fall apart, as they did in the West?
There's no way to know for sure,]{.underline} **[but there are several
reasons to hope the truth will ultimately win out]{.underline}**.
[**First, you can't hide sanctions**. Businesses are closing across
Russia due to[ sanctions against the
country](https://news.vcu.edu/article/2022/03/impact-of-sanctions-on-russias-economy).
There's a shortage of goods, jobs have disappeared, and inflation is
rising. For now, Russia is successfully blaming this on the U.S. and the
West, a tried and true [propaganda
strategy](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/703208)]{.underline}.
But many of [these sanctions are likely to have larger impacts in the
medium to long range term. As time passes and Russian citizens begin to
feel the impact of these sanctions more, their incentive to continue to
believe the party line may begin to wane]{.underline}.

[**Second, you can't hide dead soldiers.** Russian
media [reported](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/pro-kremlin-newspaper-reports-nearly-10-000-russian-soldiers-killed-in-ukraine-before-disavowing-its-story/ar-AAVnufX) that
an estimated 10,000 Russian soldiers have already died in
Ukraine]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, [government officials denied this
story and forced the paper to retract the story, claiming it had
been [posted by
hackers](https://www.businessinsider.com/pro-kremlin-tabloid-nearly-10000-russian-troops-killed-ukraine-2022-3?op=1)]{.underline}.
**[Even if that number wasn't accurate, it's clear the war is having a
bloody impact. Those soldiers are people's [sons, fathers, and
brothers](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/06/world/europe/russia-ukraine-war-casualties.html).
As casualties continue, it will be harder and harder to ignore the fact
that their country is fighting a war]{.underline}** [and is not just
engaged in a "special military operation]{.underline}." [Whether
Russians respond by doubling down in support for the war---"these
soldiers shall not have died in vain"---or turning against the war, they
will likely eventually come to be informed by the realities of
battlefield casualties.]{.underline}

Finally, **[in the digital age, it is harder to hide the
truth]{.underline}**. [**We've already seen signs that Russia's
disinformation wall can be breached**. Independent media are creating
"mirror" sites to evade government restrictions. Demand for virtual
private networks that allow citizens to circumvent bans on media and
social media has increased. And many outlets have created channels on
Telegram]{.underline} (a popular social media platform in Russia that is
still operating in the country) [to share news.]{.underline} It's clear
that, **[if people want to look beyond state TV and find out what's
really happening, some, if not many, can]{.underline}**. **[While we
often focus on the supply disinformation, it is important not to lose
sight of the demand for true information as a crucial component of
information wars]{.underline}**. The Soviet Union collapsed in part
because its population stopped believing the regime's version of
reality[; in the digital era, the distance between demand for true
information and the ability to actually acquire such information is
bound to be shorter.]{.underline}

As Sergei Guriev and Daniel Treisman highlight in their recent book Spin
Dictators[, it is easier for autocrats to be genuinely popular than to
rely on repression]{.underline}. [While Putin has extended a great deal
of effort taking control of the Russian information ecosystem, the irony
here is that these same repressive steps make it more difficult to know
what his population is actually thinking]{.underline}. **[The truth is
out there---and the day is coming when Putin may no longer be able to
tell what Russians know or when they know it]{.underline}**

#### Ukraine proves that Russia is not even capable of spreading significant disinformation

**Schogol, Task and Purpose senior pentagon reporter, 22**

\[Jeff, 5-11-2022, Task & Purpose, \"Russia actually isn\'t as good at
information warfare as everyone thought,\",
https://taskandpurpose.com/news/russia-propaganda-war-ukraine/, Accessed
7-7-2022, LASA-LR\]

[One reason why Russian information operations are flailing is "they
don't have a lot of material to work with]{.underline}," said Marek
Posard, an expert on disinformation with the RAND Corporation, a
nonprofit research organization.

"[There's only so much you can do when X number of your generals are
being killed in theater]{.underline}," Posard told Task & Purpose. (In
this case, the Ukrainians claim to have killed 12 Russian general
officers.)

[The United States and other Western nations tend to do better at
information warfare when they tell the truth, and right now the facts
are not in Russia's favor, because the invasion of Ukraine has revealed
how the Russian military is not as professional as many thought it
was.]{.underline}

"[The military operations in Ukraine clearly are not going well for the
Russians," Posard said.]{.underline} "You can't hide the fact that
civilian casualties are high. You can't hide the fact that the Russians
are shelling targets that they should not be shelling. You can't hide
the fact that there are Russian soldiers lying dead and there's tanks on
the side of the road that have been blown up."

[Russia actually isn't as good at information warfare as everyone
thought]{.underline}

[However, the Russians have often made mistakes and used flimsy claims
as part of their propaganda efforts because their goal is to flood the
airwaves with as much disinformation as possible, said Olga Lautman, an
expert on Russia and Ukraine.]{.underline}

### Status Quo Solves

**National responses to Russian propaganda are effective and are
trusted**

**Boot, Washington Post columnist & Council on Foreign Relations Senior
Fellow, 22** 

(Max, 2-10-2022, Council on Foreign Relations, \"Why the U.S. Ramped Up
Its Information War with
Russia\", https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/why-us-ramped-its-information-war-russia, accessed
on 7-7-2022, SR)

[For years, American officials have lamented that the United States
fights with one arm tied behind its back when it comes to waging
information war]{.underline}---i.e., the battle for "hearts and minds."
Adversaries including the self-declared Islamic State and the Kremlin
are free to spread lies and conspiracy theories, while the U.S.
government generally feels compelled to hew to the truth in its public
pronouncements (even as it often tries to conceal scandalous
misconduct). [U.S. adversaries find it easy to beam propaganda into the
United States---often under false pretenses via social media---but it is
harder for independent information to penetrate into more tightly
controlled media spaces in countries such as China, North Korea, and
Russia.]{.underline}

[Now, as the crisis over Ukraine escalates, the Joe Biden administration
seems to have developed an effective technique for waging information
war. Rather than allowing President Vladimir Putin's government to
freely disseminate ludicrous conspiracy theories about anti-Russia plots
involving the West and Ukraine, the administration has chosen to fight
back by releasing intelligence reports about Russia's attempts to create
a justification for an invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline}

[On January 23, the British government, acting in cooperation with the
United States, announced details of a purported Russian plot to install
a pro-Moscow regime in Kyiv.]{.underline} It even went so far as to name
a pro-Russia former member of the Ukrainian parliament as Putin's
preferred puppet.

A curation of original analyses, data visualizations, and commentaries,
examining the debates and efforts to improve health worldwide. Weekly.

[On February 3, the Biden administration released information about a
Russian scheme to film a fake attack on Russian territory or on Russian
speakers in eastern Ukraine to manufacture a justification for an
invasion.]{.underline} The administration said Russia had already
recruited people who would be involved in the fake attack. Pentagon
spokesperson John Kirby said the plan was to result in "[a very graphic
propaganda video, which would include corpses and actors who would be
depicting mourners and images of destroyed locations, as well as
military equipment at the hands of Ukraine or the West, even to the
point where some of this equipment would be made to look like it was
Western-supplied."]{.underline}

The United States has also released copious details about Russian troop
movements on Ukraine's border, along with assessments that a Russian
invasion is likely. The administration has even shared information about
reported dissension within the ranks of the Russian military over a
possible attack on Ukraine.

A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, explained
the administration's strategy to the Wall Street Journal: "We've seen
\[Russia\] run false-flag operations and use the confusion to launch
military action many times in recent history. [Exposing these plots
makes it that much harder for Russia to execute them."]{.underline}

[Journalists are naturally skeptical of the U.S. intelligence, given the
U.S. government's history making claims that did not pan
out]{.underline}---most notoriously about the presence of weapons of
mass destruction in Iraq, which was used to justify the U.S. invasion in
2003. [But there is indeed a long history of Russia using so-called
false-flag operations to justify aggression.]{.underline} In 1939, the
Soviet Union shelled its own troops near its border with Finland to
justify an invasion of that country. In 1968, KGB agents in what was
then Czechoslovakia concocted threats against the Soviet Union and even
claimed to have found a "Made in USA" arms cache to justify a Red Army
crackdown on the Prague Spring reform movement.

In 1999, Russian intelligence operatives are believed to have bombed
Russian apartment buildings to justify an invasion of Chechnya. And the
Russian invasions of Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 were both
accompanied by copious disinformation, including the use of "little
green men" (i.e., soldiers in green uniforms devoid of Russian army
insignia) to disguise the role of Russian military forces. [The Kremlin
even blamed the CIA for shooting down a Malaysian airliner over Ukraine
in 2014---an act actually carried out by Russia-backed separatists using
a Russian air defense system.]{.underline}

**[In the past, the United States was caught flat-footed by Russian
information operations. Exposing Russian plots in real time appears to
be an effective response]{.underline},** even though doing so raises
concerns about exposing the U.S. intelligence community's "sources and
methods," and journalists question whether the U.S. government's claims
can be trusted.

[At the very least, the U.S. reports throw sand into the gears of the
Russian military machine and force the Russian government to wonder
where Western intelligence agencies are getting their information, which
could possibly lead to a search for traitors within its own ranks. The
reports also neutralize Russian propaganda and allow the United States
to try to control the narrative rather than ceding to Putin and his
propagandists.]{.underline}

Given the growing importance of information operations in modern
warfare, that is no small achievement. It has already paid off in
considerable Western unity in the face of Russian threats to Ukraine.
Whether the U.S. actions will deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine,
however, is still unclear.

#### Russia\'s key warfare method is getting beaten by pushback 

**Seib, USC Annenberg School for Communication and Public Diplomacy
Professor Emeritus, 22** 

(Philip, 5-9-2022, USC Center on Public Diplomacy, \"Why Russia Is
Losing the Information
War\", https://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/why-russia-losing-information-war/, accessed
on 7-7-2022, SR)

Poor Vladimir Putin. Sitting at his long table himself, confronting
failure. [The Russian military machine, weighed down its antiquated
hardware and obsolete tactics, can barely hold its own against Ukraine.
The Russian economy is on life support. The archenemy, NATO, is poised
to expand further, adding Finland and Sweden to its ranks.]{.underline}
The Kremlin is not a happy place.

[Putin's information war is also not going well.]{.underline} Just a
decade ago, things were very different. Russia had embraced information
warfare as a low-risk tool to undermine adversaries. Gen. Valery
Gerasimov, chief of the general staff of Russia's armed forces, wrote in
2013: "The very 'rules of war' have changed. The role of nonmilitary
means of achieving political and strategic goals has grown, and, in many
cases, they have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their
effectiveness."

[For the Kremlin, information warfare is a key facet of Russia's version
of public diplomacy. With little (if any) allegiance to truth, Russia's
messaging to global publics accentuates self-justification as it pursues
dangerous adventurism.]{.underline}

In line with this, in 2014 Russia unleashed a flood of propaganda about
its need to rescue the supposedly oppressed Russian minorities in
eastern Ukraine, and followed with a de facto invasion. In 2016,
Russia's information efforts directed at the American electorate proved
effective, as the Kremlin's internet trolls helped put Donald Trump in
the White House. These successes crowned years of Russian information
skirmishing directed at the Baltic States and other former Soviet
properties that Putin wanted to reclaim.

[Given Russia's apparent preeminence in information warfare, taking
control of Ukraine seemed well within the Kremlin's grasp. This year, as
its troops massed along the Russia-Ukraine border, Russia's information
attacks were relentless, claiming that Ukraine was riddled with
corruption, was run Nazis, and was not really a nation. Once again, with
this messaging as a foundation, Russia rolled into Ukraine.]{.underline}

**[Despite its past successes, Russia's information strategy did not
work this time. The reason, in a word: pushback.]{.underline}**

[Resistance to past Russian information efforts was usually too little,
too late.]{.underline} Especially in the United States in 2016, the
breadth and effectiveness of the Russian campaign was not fully
recognized until after the election, and little was done in timely
fashion to respond to Kremlin influence.

[In 2022 that has changed, and counterattacks against Russian
information efforts have taken place on many fronts.]{.underline}
[Western journalists now recognize that they have a responsibility to
address Russian lies with timely reporting, and to find ways to
circumvent barriers to delivery of that reporting. Although the Russian
government tries to keep its citizens from seeing unfriendly news
content, the ever-expanding universe of information technology provides
workarounds.]{.underline} For example, the Telegram messaging service
offers channels that can be used Russians to peruse content from global
news media. Also, millions of Russians work around censorship
downloading a virtual private network (VPN) that allows them to access
online information that is banned their government.

[**Western governments' information agencies are also assertively
responding to Russia.** The United States Agency for Global Media
(USAGM) has undertaken a massive effort to create an information "ring
around Russia" that delivers programming designed not only for Russians,
but is also directed to publics in countries such as Belarus, Moldova,
Kazakhstan, and other neighbors of Russia.]{.underline} Since the
February invasion began, the agency has also introduced a new Ukrainian-
and Russian-language satellite channel that reaches all of Ukraine and
parts of Russia. [While the Kremlin silences independent media voices
within Russia, demand for content from abroad grows. During the first
three weeks after Russia's invasion, USAGM verified more than one
billion video views of its Russian-language programs across social media
platforms.]{.underline} The agency reports that interviews with grieving
Russian mothers whose sons were killed in combat are among the most
widely viewed.

#### Squo solves - having multinational, independent media sources cover the Ukraine conflict solves any risk of Russian disinformation 

**Schogol, Task and Purpose senior pentagon reporter, 22**

\[Jeff, 5-11-2022, Task & Purpose, \"Russia actually isn\'t as good at
information warfare as everyone thought,\",
https://taskandpurpose.com/news/russia-propaganda-war-ukraine/, Accessed
7-7-2022, LASA-LR\]

"It is not meant to direct you in any which way," Lautman said. "[It is
not meant for a critical thinker. It is more meant to pollute the
information space with so much disinformation that the person can't get
to the truth."]{.underline}

[Separately, the Russians also launch very targeted propaganda campaigns
against specific people or on certain issues, and those efforts tend to
be more thought out]{.underline}, she said. For example, the Russians
are currently putting a lot of time and effort into claims that the
Ukrainian government is kidnapping journalists to silence them.

[Since Russia attacked Ukraine in late February, though, its information
operations have been weaker than in the past because foreign media have
been on the ground to discredit Russian propaganda, Lautman
sai]{.underline}d. The New York Times recently exposed Russia's lies
about the massacre of Ukrainian civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha.

[As long as the media coverage continues, Russia's propaganda campaign
will remain weak, Lautman said.]{.underline} "[When it wanes, then you
will see Russia's disinformation operations being a lot more successful
because they'll be able to get their message across,"]{.underline} she
said.

### Turn -- Label Hides Russian Actions

#### All of Russian hybrid warfare is dangerous but Western countries underestimate Russian aggression as just \"propaganda campaigns\"

**Żaryn, Chancellery of Poland's Prime Minister National Security
Department Head, 19**

(Stanisław, 8-9-19, Defense News, \"Russia's hybrid warfare toolkit has
more to offer than
propaganda\", https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/08/09/russias-hybrid-warfare-toolkit-has-more-to-offer-than-propaganda/, accessed
on 7-2-2022, SR)

In [February 2018]{.underline}, the small town of Uzhhorod in
southwestern Ukraine bore witness to unusual events. To be more
specific, [there was an attempt to set fire to the office of the
Transcarpathian Hungarian Cultural Association. ]{.underline}

[The alleged perpetrators had arrived to the town with one goal in mind:
to destroy, record their action and vanish into thin air.]{.underline}
The plan worked, despite some problems early on. [As it turned out, the
arson attack was not necessarily an act of vandalism. There is plenty of
evidence to suggest that it could be a part of a complex hostile
influence operation fitting in the modus operandi that Russian special
services employ in their activities against the West. ]{.underline}

[In the aftermath]{.underline} of the Uzhhorod arson attack, [a part of
Hungarian infrastructure was damaged, the Ukrainian state was ridiculed
and its capability to guarantee security was questioned. And all this
happened in the middle of a harsh dispute Kiev and Budapest had been
involved in for months over the right of minorities living in Ukraine,
to use their language. ]{.underline}

[Additionally, the attack was meant to undermine relations Poland
maintains with Ukraine and Hungary, as direct executors of the plan
turned out to be Polish citizens. ]{.underline}

[This incident deserves a thorough analysis because it shows that
Russian "hybrid activities" against NATO go well beyond spreading fake
news or pushing manipulated narratives. The Russian hybrid warfare
toolkit has more to offer, including aggressive activities or even
inflicting physical harm. ]{.underline}

[Western countries have been waking up to the aggressive methods Russia
uses against NATO members. Unfortunately, many people still have a
limited understanding of what the term "Russian activities" really
means.]{.underline} Their [first thought would be]{.underline}
"propaganda campaigns" or ["spreading lies and disinformation through
the media." And they could not be more wrong.]{.underline} **[Such
simplification is a huge mistake, potentially leading to the
underestimation of a really serious threat. ]{.underline}**

In fact, apart from information activities per se, Russia carries out
so-called hostile influence campaigns. These consume more resources and
require the use of a multitude of methods. Main tasks are performed by
Russian special services which --- given the realities in Russia --- are
able to force any institution in the country to push its agenda. [They
carry out intelligence work, and "intelligence work" Russian-style quite
often translates to "launching kinetic operations." These aggressive
measures can be used as part of hostile influence. ]{.underline}

The Uzhhorod incident of 2018 prompted a response from Polish
authorities. Poland's domestic counterintelligence agency, ABW, soon
identified the alleged perpetrators and the mastermind behind the
attack. Their trial in a Polish court is pending. 

As testified by the accused and found by the ABW, the arson attack had
been meticulously planned. The group had communicated via encrypted
messaging apps, they had used mobile phones purchased exclusively for
the needs of that action and they had traveled in such a way so as to
lose potential tails. During all that time they had been in touch with
the brains behind the attack who had evaluated their every step, as well
as the final effect. 

[The statements made by the accused and the findings of facts provide
enough evidence to conclude that what happened in Uzhhorod was a
well-planned operation intended to cause an international political
sabotage. Presumably, it was carried out for propaganda purposes on the
one hand, and for political ones on the other. ]{.underline}

The trial also revealed the international background of the case. Michał
P. (full name withheld under Polish privacy laws), a Pole in charge of
recruiting the thugs for the attack and the "big fish" on the Polish
side, stated that the order to engage in Ukraine had come from Germany.
More specifically, Michał P. named a German journalist with ties to
Germany's far-right party, AfD, as the mastermind behind the operation.
The journalist was supposed to have shared the plan of the attack with
Michał P. The plan's main points involved setting fire to the building
of the Hungarian center in Uzhhorod and painting fascist symbols on its
walls. [So the version of events presented by Polish suspects ---
subject to initial verification within the investigation --- indicates
that the order to escalate tensions between Poland, Ukraine and Hungary
may have originated from a German political party often accused of being
pro-Russian. ]{.underline}

The wicked plan had landed on fertile soil in Poland. The Polish trio
engaged in the provocation turned out to sympathize with marginal or
even almost nonexistent yet extremist groups active in the country. [In
fact, Michał P. himself used to have ties to the Zmiana (Change) party
whose then-leader, Mateusz P]{.underline}. (again, full name withheld),
[has been awaiting trial for espionage and collaboration with Russian
and Chinese intelligence services. The remaining two Poles belong to a
far-right organization believed to be vulnerable to Russian influence
and often exploited to undermine Polish-Ukrainian
relations]{.underline}. 

[The Uzhhorod arson attack should raise the question about the extent of
Russian influence in Western European countries.]{.underline} In fact,
[there are groups supporting the actions Russia undertakes against the
Central and Eastern European countries, their sovereignty, and relations
between Brussels and Washington.]{.underline} Members of such groups act
in a way that is congruent with the Kremlin's political aims. These
include the polarization of political sentiment in particular countries,
preventing them from entering into a close cooperation in areas the
Kremlin deems as strategic, and impeding regional consolidation.
[Oftentimes, the said groups receive funding from Russia. The ultimate
goal of its activities is to fuel tensions between particular
countries]{.underline} (both locally and centrally) [and, consequently,
to undermine their bilateral and multilateral relations as well as make
particular Central and Eastern European countries lean toward
Russia. ]{.underline}

The case presented herein is just the tip of an iceberg. However, it is
an important tip, as **[it clearly shows that with the politics of
Russia come real-life threats that go far beyond mere disinformation
Western countries are so willing to point at]{.underline}**. [The
Uzhhorod operation originated from a third country; it was well-planned
and designed with the intention to spark political quarrels between at
least three states; an exemplary kinetic operation in support of the
Kremlin's interests in Central and Eastern Europe. ]{.underline}

[In recent years, Moscow has become more and more brutal in
subordinating the countries of the region to its political and business
goals. It has been using as proxies those groups that for different
reasons would be eager to help push its agenda against the West. We must
be aware of the nature and methods of the Kremlin's
actions.]{.underline} **[Narrowing down Russia's hostile activity to
spreading lies in the media is a losing battle. ]{.underline}**

#### Risk of escalation overblown -- Russia only uses nukes as a scare tactic and won't follow through

ultimately to the use of nuclear weapons.]{.underline} [This is

'terminus ad quem' has been ruthlessly leveraged by Putin]{.underline}.
He has used it to create a very large space in which he can wage
conventional war in Europe without a military response from NATO.
[Theories of escalation assume conventional warfare sits on the same
continuum as nuclear]{.underline}, [that is to say that the decision to
use a nuclear weapon will flow directly from the earlier decisions to
escalate. It is, however, of an entirely separate nature.]{.underline}

[The US and Russia have form on nuclear de-escalation, both in the
graphic instance of Cuba and over time through treaty-based
arms-limitation measures. Moving to a nuclear exchange would be a
monumental step for either side. It fits neither Putin's plan to restore
the Russian dominion as his legacy, nor the West's to contain him, nor
both sides' desire to survive]{.underline}. The evidence is not that he
wants to pull the knife of a nuclear exchange, but that [he wants to use
the threat of it, occasionally even letting us see the blade of his
knife, to give him the freedom to pummel his adversaries with his
fists.]{.underline}

### Status Quo Solves

#### Status quo solves now: governments and social media platforms are actively combating disinformation

[Online platforms have developed a significant array of mechanisms
against information manipulation, in response to---and hence in
accordance with---the criticisms they face.]{.underline} [The
intensification of these critiques has compelled platforms to put
forward a great number of measures within a very short time span,
without always having previously articulated a genuine response
strategy]{.underline}. In this respect, the various proposed measures do
not always have the same goal (provide targeted or more structural
responses), or the same temporality (preventive or ad hoc action), the
same scale (measures applying to just one country or to all users[).
They can nevertheless be categorized along the six following
criteria:]{.underline}

[A significant proportion of those measures aim at fostering Internet
users' awareness of the processes by which information is exchanged,
disseminated and hierarchized on online platforms: for example, Facebook
has published user guides outlining good practices to deal with
information circulating on social networks]{.underline}; Google has
intensified its didactic efforts to explain the criteria underpinning
the sequencing of information by search engines. [These
awareness-raising strategies are not confined to prevention: online
platforms have also decided to alert their users who were exposed to
false information.]{.underline} This was notably the case with Facebook,
which announced they had sent a warning message to those users whose
data had been collected by Cambridge Analytica during the U.S.
presidential election (so far amounting to 87 million users[). For each
of these examples, the stated goal is to give internet users "the tools"
that will enable them to identify and respond to information
manipulation themselves.]{.underline}

[Moreover, a number of platforms---including Facebook---have reached out
directly to various candidates in the presidential election so as to
make them aware of the risks and encourage them to develop good internet
practices.]{.underline} [More broadly, online platforms have also
strengthened the protection of data privacy, for it appears that
information manipulation campaigns are often based on the exploitation
of personal data---either by stealing it or by tailoring it to their
narratives. Thus Facebook has significantly improved the interface that
allows its users to control the visibility of their personal
data]{.underline} (in particular through a centralization of all
settings). [The platforms are also more active in protecting their users
against the risk of data piracy]{.underline}: in early May 2018, faced
with a leak which risked exposing its users' passwords, Twitter
demonstrated its responsiveness by immediately asking users to change
their passwords.

[Finally, through public hearings, large online platforms contribute to
raising public awareness of the need for increased vigilance against
information manipulation.]{.underline}

[Information manipulation campaigns often rely on automated accounts
(bots), networks of automated accounts (netbots) and anonymous
accounts.]{.underline} [Whereas platforms used to be reluctant to
identify and deactivate the latter---for a number of
reason]{.underline}s (economic model, editorial neutrality)---they have
recently shifted their approach. [They started by taking a closer look
at their users' accounts so as to suspend accounts that were fake,
automated, and/or suspected of participation in an information
manipulation campaign. Twitter announced that it had suspended over
50,000 accounts "connected to Russian interference,"]{.underline} to
quote the company's spokesperson. However it is difficult to assess the
effectiveness of these account suspension campaigns. [They very often do
not confine themselves to targeting accounts that are likely to
participate in information manipulation campaigns: they mostly suspend
fake accounts sold by reputation management companies whose aim is to
boost their clients' visibility.]{.underline} In late 2014, [Instagram
thus launched an operation to purge 300 million accounts]{.underline}
(#PurgeInstagram), which had significant repercussions for the
visibility of American stars' accounts (Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry,
Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber and Rihanna). Facebook had adopted a
similar approach in 2012[, by launching a large hunt against fake
"likes," though with only limited success. Since 2016, the fight against
"the fake" has become the object of a war of figures, the effectiveness
of which is difficult to assess. At the end of the first quarter of
2018, Facebook claimed to have suspended 583 million fake accounts and
about 1.3 billion over six months]{.underline}.

[In cooperation with the US government, Facebook, Twitter and Google
have also set up an initiative aimed at creating a common database
listing fake accounts and the strategies developed by trolls to escape
identification. The goal is to optimize information manipulation
detection by exchanging information on the models and actors behind
it.]{.underline} [Other measures, relying on artificial intelligence,
have been implemented to detect and suspend these accounts, sometimes
even before they are activated. Twitter thus prohibited the use of
multiple accounts simultaneously (a method very often adopted by
trolls).]{.underline} Along the same lines, Facebook also announced that
they had developed a tool enabling them to detect the serial publication
of similar messages and comments. All of these techniques are routinely
used by manipulation campaigns

[Online platforms have developed several measures to speed up the
removal of malicious content. While techniques based on artificial
intelligence are used as preventive measures]{.underline} [(before the
content is published online), platforms continue to rely on human
involvement to monitor---and sometimes erase---exchanged content and
dubious advertising. In December 2017, Facebook announced that they had
recruited an additional 1,000 staff members to check advertising and
remove it whenever it did not meet acceptable standards (i.e. when they
target people according to their political, religious, ethnic or social
affiliation).]{.underline} Facebook has also increased the teams
dedicated to verifying dubious content by over 60%, with a total staff
of 8,000 people globally. [While this reinforcement of human involvement
is significant, it must be noted that it primarily concerns the
monitoring of content deemed illegal and/or related to terrorism. In
July 2018, however, Facebook announced the implementation of a "new
policy" of deleting content susceptible of causing violence, starting
first with countries where disinformation has triggered
violence]{.underline},78 such as Sri Lanka, for example, where messages
claiming that Muslims were poisoning Buddhist food were erased from
social networks.

[Twitter also sped up the cleaning process, through the introduction in
May-June 2018 of new mesures to combat trolling and hateful and
extremist comments,79 and the suspension of at least 70 million accounts
in only two months---twice as high as the suspension rate in October
2017. 80 Platforms have also enhanced reporting mechanisms:]{.underline}
procedures allowing internet users to report dubious posts have been
simplified. [Google has recently introduced tools enabling its users to
report "misleading and false" content. Facebook now grants greater
attention to the feedback and comments of web users who have identified
fake information. More broadly, Facebook seeks to standardize its
response to information manipulation through the]{.underline}
development of an analytical framework that they call "Problems,
Surfaces and Actions." [The goal of this framework is to objectify
response thresholds (when and how to respond), coordinate the work of
various teams and enforce a standard response procedure. The latter
includes, in particular, recommending fact-checking
articles]{.underline} [(which deal with the same facts as the dubious
content posted online and enable users to take a step back from the fake
information); notifying the number of other users who deemed the
information to be false or misleading; and an alert that the user is
likely to relay false information]{.underline}. In the same vein,
YouTube chose to display, next to some conspiracy videos, a link to a
Wikipedia article directly challenging the conspiracy narrative.

[Finally, online platforms also developed tools to detect the "deep
fake," i.e. fake news that can very convincingly reproduce the effects
of reality. Google has announced that it has created a tool capable of
detecting such videos (in particular those that can make public figures
talk) and of removing such content before it is posted
online.]{.underline}

[For a number of reasons (cultural, economic, technical), online
platforms are wary of regulation. They tend to favor informal
cooperation with public authorities and the media.]{.underline}
[Facebook thus collaborates on a regular basis with traditional media
outlets so as to exchange records listing those articles circulating on
its website which were flagged as fake news.]{.underline} Google
reported having done the same during the American and French
presidential campaigns. The two platforms also ran several initiatives
in close cooperation with civil society and the media to counter
information manipulation (see above).

[Facebook also declared that it had collaborated directly with the
German government during the most recent general elections. The terms of
that partnership were directly dictated by German legislation regulating
social networks, which---among other things---makes it compulsory for
these online networks to remove any blatantly illegal content, and in
particular hate speech and discrimination, within a very short time span
(between 24 hours and 7 days in contentious cases).]{.underline} Other
countries are also considering implementing legislative mechanisms that
would oblige platforms to act more decisively against contentious
content.

[Platforms very often choose to promote constructive approaches to
counter information manipulation. A policy favored by many of them
consists in reinforcing the visibility of reliable content and/or those
produced by trustworthy media sources in their search engines and news
feeds.]{.underline} [This entails, in particular, updating ranking
algorithms as well as blocking websites that do not display their
country of origin.]{.underline} It also implies proactive action to
detect the most common sources of disinformation (conspiracy sites,
sites masquerading as institution websites and relaying false
information) so as to reduce their visibility (without necessarily
removing them).

YouTube, Google and Facebook also put in place the "Trust Project
Initiative," in partnership with Santa Clara University, whose objective
is to promote reliable content by enabling those who produce it to share
information on the fact-checking procedures they implement, the history
of the media outlets for which they work, as well as the structure and
identity of its management and shareholders. [These various elements of
information, which appear as tabs, seek to highlight the ethical
standards and the trustworthiness of these various media
sources.]{.underline}

[Finally, digital platforms also promote the creation of spaces for
"constructive" debate: Twitter has undertaken to develop, for example,
indicators that make it possible to monitor the diversity of exchanged
opinion(s),]{.underline} [the receptivity of users and media awareness
of the issue. As for the Snapchat application, which is very popular
with younger demographics, it has opted to divide its content into two
categories: "Discover" and "Social." This division enables Snapchat to
indirectly promote institutional media, which are the only media sources
that appear in the "Discover" section (other types of content that
present themselves as information---blog posts, comments, shared posts
and articles---are confined to the "Social" interface).]{.underline}

[In the face of stark criticism for their naivety and lack of
discernment towards the impact and the scale of information manipulation
campaigns, the platforms have emphasized their need to better understand
the phenomenon.]{.underline} To achieve this, they have put in place
various partnerships and exchange policies with the world of research.
Facebook has, for example, recently agreed to share some of its data
with Stanford University, enabling the latter to study information
manipulation campaigns, notably through its "Project on Democracy and
the Internet."

Likewise, the platforms contribute to the funding of initiatives aimed
at developing a better awareness of ethical issues linked to platform
usage, including in the field of information. This is, for example, what
Google sought to do by creating "DeepMind Ethics & Society".

[While the social platforms have come to grips with the fight against
information manipulation, there remains a lot of work to be done. As The
Wall Street Journal recalls, Twitter CEO himself, Jack Dorsey, shared at
least 17 tweets from a Russian troll between late 2016 and
mid-2017.81]{.underline}

### Impact Takeouts

#### Impacts of disinformation are overblown

**Lim, Harvard Kennedy School\'s Shorenstein Center Technology and
Social Change Research Project Researcher, 20** 

(Gabrielle, 8-7-2020, Centre for International Governance Innovation,
\"The Risks of Exaggerating Foreign Influence Operations and
Disinformation
\", https://www.cigionline.org/articles/risks-exaggerating-foreign-influence-operations-and-disinformation/, accessed
on 7-7-2022, SR)

[In recent years, concerns over foreign interference from "bad actors"
have increased, and in the wake of the 2016 US presidential election,
governments around the world, social media companies and civil society
alike have been on the lookout for such attempts to degrade the
integrity of our elections or, more vaguely, to "sow
discord."]{.underline} From pseudonymous trolls and botnets to
outrage-inducing, hyper-partisan content, it seems that week after week,
there is news that online accounts are pushing narratives in the
interest of Russia, Iran or China. T[he Global Engagement Center (GEC),
a division of the US State Department, for example, has alleged that
Russia is operating an "ecosystem" of humans and bots to amplify
conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 in a bid to "sow discord and
undermine U.S. institutions and alliances."]{.underline} Senator
Elizabeth Warren even released a detailed plan to fight disinformation
as part of her presidential campaign, citing "foreign actors" as the
main threat. [Scholars and journalists are also on the hunt. Indeed,
plenty of ink has been spilled on the ills of "weaponized social media"
and the next generation of "active measures."]{.underline}

**[However, despite all the fears of mass-targeted influence operations
from foreign adversaries, it remains unclear whether they have much
impact at all.]{.underline}**

Evidence and analysis of activity from the Russian-based Internet
Research Agency (IRA) continue to be debated[. Although some suggest
that it was plausible the IRA influenced public opinion, there is very
little evidence of direct impact on the US 2016 presidential election.
The bulk of their activity was engaged in audience building, and when
compared to the massive volumes of media consumed by the average
American across mainstream, independent and social media,
Russian-sponsored activities would have been but a drop in an otherwise
chaotic and constantly churning sea of information. Attempts by China to
influence the Taiwanese election were likewise ineffective, as incumbent
and pro-democracy leader Tsai Ing-wen won a second term by a wide
margin. Reporting on such influence operations, however, is often
couched in wording that implies attribution and effect without actual
verification or convincing evidence.]{.underline}

Of course, the threat of influence operations should not be taken
lightly and warrants investigation and thoughtful study. Yet, the
knee-jerk reactions to foreign influence campaigns from some policy
makers and parts of civil society have exaggerated the impact, and
therefore the threat, of foreign-targeted influence operations. And, [in
an ironic twist, our fears and concerns that foreign actors are somehow
interfering with democracy and deliberative discourse are,
counterintuitively, allowing for the further erosion of democracy and
deliberative discourse.]{.underline}

#### Disinformation is subject to diminishing returns

https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4098988, accessed 7-5-2022) SS:/

Contrary to classical forms of communicative disruption -- such as
traditional media propaganda -- [digital disinformation has a shorter
strategic utility span, but has a wider and faster
reach]{.underline}.^30^ [Digital disinformation attempts can spread
across a global audience within a matter of minutes and potentially
alter short-term beliefs about key events, but is always subject to
debunking and fact-checking after its immediate benefits.]{.underline}
Moreover, [in contrast to traditional propaganda, digital disinformation
often focuses more on weakening the adversary's narrative and framing of
events rather than strengthening own side and it is this uniquely
disruptive focus of digital disinformation that separates its strategic
utility from that of classical propaganda efforts]{.underline}.^31^

Yet, [the Attacker's advantage in disinformation is generally
short-lived. Following its immediate effect on demobilizing,
demoralizing and debilitating Defender's efforts, the Attacker gets
debunked and the fact-checked version of its narrative spreads equally
fast across ICTs and social media.]{.underline} [This debunking
generates a form of 'reputational penalty' for the Attacker, who gets
'named and shamed' in international platforms and suffers from an
additional, secondary 'suspicion penalty' on its successive
communication efforts.]{.underline}^32^ [An Attacker that overuses
disinformation suffers these reputational and suspicion penalties at an
increasing rate, causing its factually correct public diplomacy and
government communication efforts to be met with low interest and
resistance, and being accused of crying wolf]{.underline}. In turn,
[each utilization of disinformation by an Attacker as a foreign policy
tool, reduces the effectiveness of its successive communication efforts
-- disinformation and otherwise -- lowering the net utility the Attacker
gets from communicative manipulation at each successive
turn]{.underline}. In simple terms, [disinformation as a foreign policy
tool has diminishing returns, whereby its overproduction results in
increasing penalties in successive rounds of an iterative multi-stage
game.]{.underline}

### Alternate Cause -- Internal Disinformation

#### No solvency -- disinformation internal to Alliance undermines the plan -- it camouflages enemy disinformation

[An increasing risk for the]{.underline} transatlantic [Alliance also
comes from **within.** Political actors in democracies are imitating and
employing tactics widely utilized by foreign malign actors.
Disinformation thus becomes not only a weapon against their own
populations,]{.underline} [but it creates the perfect camouflage for
foreign actors to abscond their operations and further their goals. The
landscape of disinformation is changing from identifiable external
enemies to blurred boundaries between foreign, state, non-state, and
domestic actors, making attribution and response increasingly more
difficult]{.underline}.

### No Solvency -- Debunking Fails

#### No Solvency -- Debunking is not effective against sophisticated attacks or attackers with an alternate risk calculus.

Finally, [Attackers often play down the reputational costs of initiating
a disinformation campaign and overestimate their short-term net utility
compared to their medium- and long-term reputational costs originating
from this action.]{.underline} [Attackers may view short-term payoffs
from initiating a disinformation campaign]{.underline} (by distracting
and demobilizing the Defender) [more preferable compared to any obscure
reputational and suspicion penalties later on]{.underline} [-- or
believe that the Defender cannot debunk the claim]{.underline}. Indeed,
[the Defender may not always successfully debunk a disinformation claim,
especially when the volume of disinformation is too high (such as a
botnet campaign), or the disinformation is built in a sophisticated,
hard-to-debunk fashion. If the Attacker believes that its disinformation
campaign is sophisticated enough that it will be difficult to fact-check
its claims, it will pursue disinformation believing that it will not
suffer from reputational or suspicion penalties later on.]{.underline}
Similarly, [even if the Defender successfully debunks a claim, it may
not be able to disseminate its fact-checked response widely or in
time.]{.underline} Indeed, this was the core claim of Vosoughi, Roy and
Aral's (2018) seminal work: [in politically charged environments, false
news spread faster and wider than accurate news across social media
platforms.]{.underline}^35^ Similarly, Saling et. al. (2021) finds that
[even users that regularly fact-check news online can still share
disinformation inadvertently if the event is emotional and momentous
enough.]{.underline}^36^ To that end, [in some cases, the Defender may
debunk successfully, but it may fail to disseminate true claims
sufficiently and as a result, may fail to generate international public
reaction against the Attacker and fall short of 'naming and shaming' the
Attacker.]{.underline}^37^

Therefore, [an Attacker may find initiating a disinformation campaign
preferable, if:]{.underline}\
a. [it has a different calculus about reputational and suspicion costs
of the interaction compared to the Defender and the international
audience]{.underline} (IA),\
b. [it believes the Defender will not be able to 'name and shame' -- or
at least on time]{.underline},\
c. [it believes the Defender will not be able to successfully debunk and
disseminate the claims]{.underline},\
d. [if will not suffer from significant reputational or suspicion costs
beyond the short-term, or if both costs are not significant enough in
comparison to its short-term payoff.]{.underline}

### Alt Cause -- NATO Divisions

#### Alt causes - Disinformation tampers threat perceptions by creating attribution problems but NATO divisions better explain the apathetic response in Ukraine.

The foreign policy use of such terms predates the 2016 US elections and
proliferated after the Russian military involvement in Crimea and
Donbas.^9^ [The primary reason for this contextual proliferation was the
Russian decision to deny the initial stages of both its involvement in
Ukraine and its broader strategy of distracting and dividing Western
attention over Russian military operations]{.underline}.^10^ [There is
still a debate over whether it was really Russian information operations
that had derailed NATO's response in Ukraine, or if]{.underline}
[disinformation discourses are employed in order to shift the blame over
to Russia for the time when NATO was already divided over its commitment
to Ukraine.]{.underline}^11^ [While there is robust evidence of Russian
information operations in Ukraine and their role in spreading
disinformation in NATO countries, NATO's sustained apathy towards the
rising Russian military influence in the Black Sea after 2014 and in
Syria after 2015 support the latter claim.]{.underline}

### Alt Cause -- Social Media

#### No Solvency -- Social Media algorithms are opaque to researchers and can't be moderated by traditional mechanisms.

[Social media platforms disrupted the preexisting institutions and
practices that amplified or filtered out claims in media
systems.]{.underline} In particular, they have partially displaced
journalists as gatekeepers (Graves and Anderson 2020). This development
is not entirely negative, because journalistic news selection often
excludes diverse perspectives and caters to holders of political or
economic power, among other defects. However, [social media are not
neutral "intermediaries"]{.underline} (Chadwick 2017; Gillespie 2018),
and [they shape the genres, speed, curation, and dissemination patterns
of communication in new and often problematic ways.]{.underline}

[One major change is the role of algorithms]{.underline}. For instance,
[platform algorithms determine the discoverability of content via search
engines, set the order of messages in newsfeeds, and provide changing
and often micro-targeted lists of "trending topics" to users.
**Algorithmic curation is opaque**: most users do not understand how
their individual information feeds are moderated, and]{.underline}
**[independent researchers do not have the data needed to understand
dissemination patterns.]{.underline}** To serve social media company
business models, this "[black box moderation" uses
"engagement-optimizing algorithms that prioritize enticing
content---even if from a source peddling clickbait or political outrage,
or promoted by bots, trolls, or . . . agents using false
identities]{.underline}" (Kornbluh, Goodman, and Weiner 2020, 8).

There is long-standing concern that social media produce "echo chambers"
or "filter bubbles" (Pariser 2011), such that selective exposure to
information in like-minded communities increases political polarization
and decreases acceptance of shared facts. Evidence suggests that
relatively few citizens are confined to these echo chambers (Dubois and
Blank 2018; Nelson and Webster 2017), but social media do appear to
facilitate the circulation of messages that provoke strong emotions or
signal identity affiliations (Vosoughi, Roy, and Aral 2018; Wardle and
Derakhshan 2017). For instance, online partisan news articles stoke
anger that can encourage users to share material that is polarizing or
generates hostility (Hasell and Weeks 2016). [It appears that the
exposure to and promotion of false claims are mediated by factors,
including political partisanship, political interest, media literacy,
age, and certain psychological traits]{.underline} (Bail et al. 2020;
Dubois and Blank 2018; Grinberg et al. 2019). In the United States,
[these effects appear to be politically asymmetric, as more right-wing
social media users appear to consume and share false news at higher
levels]{.underline} (Grinberg et al. 2019; Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler
2018).

[Disinformation campaigns exploit these elements of social media design
to push disinformation from relatively fringe sites into much broader
circulation. In particular, provocative content may generate viral
dissemination on social media or may provoke reporting by mainstream
news outlets]{.underline} (Phillips 2018; Vargo, Guo, and Amazeen 2018).
This strategy is referred to as "the propaganda pipeline" by Benkler,
Faris, and Roberts (2018). [The social media accounts of Russian-backed
operatives often used social media accounts to amplify divisive
alt-right messaging that would be picked up by a receptive rightwing
media ecosystem in the United States which includes right-wing talk
radio outlets and Fox News]{.underline} (Benkler, Faris, and Roberts
2018; Marwick and Lewis 2017).

First, [social media companies have long downplayed their role as media
companies to avoid attendant regulations]{.underline} (Gillespie 2018).
While [social media]{.underline} undoubtedly have different patterns of
use and editorial control than other types of mass media, they clearly
[wield social and political power that requires oversight.]{.underline}
Second[, the influence that social media platforms have on mass
communication and political opinion has been opaque, which has limited
demands for public justification. Their means of influence---including
algorithmic boosting and targeted messaging that is invisible to other
users---are hard to detect, particularly because the companies
themselves have long avoided transparency]{.underline} (Gillespie 2018;
Kornbluh, Goodman, and Weiner 2020). Third, [social media platforms
structure user interaction at a global level, according to policies and
design choices that are primarily made in company headquarters in a
single country]{.underline} (predominately the United States). To a
large extent, [regulation and oversight have been limited to the country
where these headquarters are based. Governments and experts have
proposed increased]{.underline} regulation of social media platforms to
address disinformation and other forms of "online harms" (United Kingdom
Parliament 2019; see also European Commission 2018). As we will argue, a
deliberative systems analysis can help identify policies to reduce harms
that disinformation poses to democratic debate, while addressing
concerns about undemocratic controls on speech and violations of rights
to free expression.

[This online campaign shares many qualities with decades of information
operations by the Russian government, mounted against domestic and
foreign populations]{.underline} (Paul and Matthews 2016; U.S. Senate
2019, 11--14). Russian dezinformatsiya tactics include the propagation
of false or misleading information in the news media, and the creation
or funding of domestic front groups to advance Russian aims, [with the
goals of "widening existing rifts; stoking existing tensions; and
destabilizing other states' relations with their publics and one
another"]{.underline} (Jack 2017, 9). Perhaps the most notable
development is that [this and other online disinformation campaigns are
"participatory in nature. Their messages spread through--- and with the
help of---online crowds and other information providers"]{.underline}
(Starbird, Arif, and Wilson 2019, emphasis in original). That is,
[online disinformation campaigns achieve a sense of ubiquity and scale
at relatively low cost by exploiting vulnerabilities in the structure of
the social media platforms that mediate interactions between
citizens.]{.underline}

## Democracy

### No Internal Link -- Disinformation

#### No internal link -- disinformation is completely overblown and does not significantly affect democracy in any way.

A fake problem: In an article he wrote for CJR in 2017, [Jacob Nelson, a
professor at the Arizona State University's journalism school, argued
that fake news was "a fake problem." Evidence gathered from online
analytics tools like comScore, he said, showed that "the audience for
fake news is real, but it's also really small."]{.underline}

A crazy idea: [In an infamous quote not long after the 2016 election,
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg scoffed at the idea that fake news could
have influenced the outcome. "I think the idea that fake news on
Facebook---which is a very small amount of the content---influenced the
election in any way \[is\] a pretty crazy idea]{.underline}," he said.
He later said he regretted downplaying the effect of fake news.

Blame the media: [In a study published in late 2017, Duncan Watts and
David Rothschild from Microsoft Research argued that the amount and
reach of misinformation was unlikely to have had any noticeable impact
on the election]{.underline}, and that instead of blaming fake news, we
should "blame the mainstream media."

Blame the media 2: [A group of researchers from Harvard and MIT argued
in a paper looking at the election results that the problem was a
right-wing media ecosystem anchored around Breitbart News that "used
social media as a backbone to transmit a hyper-partisan perspective to
the world."]{.underline}

### No Effect on Democracy

#### The plan solves for nothing, the scope and magnitude of disinformation is simply too small and nuanced to even have an effect on democracies.

[Nyhan says his data shows so-called "fake news" reached only a tiny
proportion of the population before and during the 2016
election]{.underline}. [In most cases, misinformation from a range of
fake news sites made up just 2 percent or less of the average person's
online news consumption, and even among the group of older conservatives
who were most likely to consume fake news, it only made up about 8
percent]{.underline}. Not only that, but the [University of Michigan
researcher says a new paper he and his colleagues recently published
shows the reach of fake news actually fell significantly between the
2016 election and the midterm elections last year]{.underline}, which
suggests Facebook has cracked down on the problem. [Nyhan also says "no
credible evidence exists that exposure to fake news changed the outcome
of the 2016 election."]{.underline}

This might come as a surprise to Kathleen Hall Jamieson. She's a veteran
public policy researcher who published a book last year entitled
Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President.
Jamieson, whose colleagues call her "the Drill Sergeant" for her
no-nonsense attitude, has more 40 years of studying human behavior under
her belt. In the book, she says the evidence suggests misinformation
propagated by Russian trolls likely influenced the outcome of the
election, in part because of the number of "swing" or undecided voters
who were susceptible to those kinds of tactics. Jamieson also notes that
the traditional news media played a key role in spreading this fake news
and propaganda, by writing innumerable articles about Hillary Clinton's
emails. And she argues [fake news wouldn't have had to make much of an
impact to influence the election, since a fairly small number of votes
gave Trump the electoral college wins he needed.]{.underline}

[Nyhan and his fellow researchers, however, including Princeton
political scientist Andrew Guess, say their study looked at the actual
behavior of a large sample of users]{.underline} who consented to have
their online activity tracked and recorded in real time, and then
followed up with interviews about their perceptions of the content. [Not
only was the amount of actual fake news they encountered incredibly
tiny,]{.underline} Guess told CJR this past fall, [but the idea that
this would influence their behavior is also a bit of a
stretch]{.underline} (something Nyhan wrote about for The New York Times
last year). "[It's predominantly people who are inclined to believe the
conclusions that are being made in this content, not so much swaying
them to believe something]{.underline}," Guess said. "In other words,
it's more or less just confirmation bias."

### AT: Polarization

#### Polarisation isn't dangerous and can create social change

**Pausch, Salzburg University applied Science Political Scientist,
21** \[Markus Pausch, 10-10-2021, accessed on 7-8-2022, European Journal
of Futures Research, \"The future of polarisation in Europe: relative
cosmopolitanism and democracy - European Journal of Futures Research\",

accessed on 7-8-2022, MG\]

[However, polarisation processes are not to be regarded as dangerous or
endangering democracy per se. To a certain extent, they are part of
pluralistic societies. Historically, polarisation processes have even
often been a precondition for social change towards more
democracy]{.underline}. [Polarisation often starts from below and
develops bottom-up. When social movements recognise a lack of justice or
opportunities for themselves or other groups and fight against
it]{.underline}, a [hardening of positions is to be expected at first,
as the dominant or privileged groups feel threatened and may reject the
demands. Only when the pressure of the social movement becomes so strong
that it leads to a concession can polarisation develop towards
democratisation. For this to happen, the polarisation process must be
turned around positively through dialogue and inclusion]{.underline}
(cf. \[39\], 234).

#### There are scenarios where polarisation is good to create strong social change 

**Pausch, Salzburg University applied Science Political Scientist,
21** \[Markus Pausch, 10-10-2021, accessed on 7-8-2022, European Journal
of Futures Research, \"The future of polarisation in Europe: relative
cosmopolitanism and democracy - European Journal of Futures Research\",

accessed on 7-8-2022, MG\]

[In the second scenario, the initial situation is similar. Polarisers
are driving society apart. Authoritarian populists with nationalist
arguments face dogmatic cosmopolitans who sometimes cultivate a kind of
lifestyle arrogance. The difference, however, arises in the response to
the polarisation process. While in the first scenario there are no
bridge-builders in a powerful position, in the second scenario a
positive, democracy-promoting form of confrontation develops, based on a
relative, rebellious cosmopolitanism.]{.underline} The reaction to the
burgeoning exclusive and nationalist communitarianism is similar among
some actors here as well. We assume here too, that some argue with moral
appeals and disregard the realities of people's lives. In contrast to
the first scenario, however, [relative cosmopolitans enter the scene and
build bridges. To build democratic bridges, it is not the pushers who
need to be addressed, but the undecided middle. Relative cosmopolitans
avoid the two mistakes described in the first scenario. They are neither
ignorant towards socio-economic and political inequality, nor are they
naïve in terms of the transferability of democracy and the role of the
nation state.]{.underline}

[This cosmopolitism is relative also in the way as it does not regard
the goal as an absolute dogma for which all means are justified and
because it allows individuals and societies more differentiated paths to
the goal. It is thus a cosmopolitanism that arises from the reality of
life. It is rebellious because it includes resistance to every form of
authoritarianism and to every kind of polarisation or
division]{.underline}, [not only on a political level, but on a daily
life level. Dialogue is the basis of this relative, rebellious
cosmopolitanism. It is what Albert Camus describes as the experience of
someone who develops his solidarity from the experiences of poverty in a
concrete situation \[12\]. It is thus not an academic or abstract
universalism of a winner of globalisation, but the human solidarity of a
person who develops cosmopolitanism solidarity in the experience of
everyday life challenges. This turns cosmopolitanism to its humanist
core. It is not founded on economic or intellectual superiority, not on
the experience of being a winner, but on the contrary, on the experience
of existential suffering.]{.underline} This can also be called
cosmopolitanism from below or rooted cosmopolitanism \[2, 4\]. The
crucial point is the one that Patrick Hayden emphasises with recourse to
Camus: A cosmopolitanism that is not dogmatic, that does not itself
become an ideology \[28\]. Michael F. Mascolo describes it from a
psychological perspective and suggests a relational-dialectical approach
for constructive political discourse. This approach builds bridges
through dialectical engagement \[37\]. The inclusion and understanding
of the other plays a central role in this[. The characteristics of
polarisation are mitigated by these strategies. Political opponents are
not considered enemies. Instead of tugging at the undecided, different
positions are allowed and discussed. There are a number of examples in
history where such strategies based on dialogue achieved a positive
effect]{.underline} (see \[51, 57\]).

In Scenario 2, [the polarising strategies of the pushers are thus
contrasted with a dialectical method of discourse, dialogue and
democracy. However, in order to achieve this on a large scale, efforts
are needed from different actors at different political
levels]{.underline}, from the European Commission, the European
Parliament, the ministries in the nation states, from regional and local
authorities and finally from further organisations and interest [groups.
Two preconditions are necessary. At the level of legislation, a further
increase in social inequality is prevented in this scenario. Rather,
social action is taken to end poverty and promote inclusion. The risks
of globalisation are no longer passed on to the individual, but are
assumed by the state. At the same time, access opportunities to
education, jobs and political participation are increased]{.underline}.
[The second crucial step is to improve the quality of democracy and
dialogue. Efforts are needed here from the local level up to the
supranational level. The end of the European consensus, which has long
held as a permissive consensus, is being replaced by a discursive,
public debate, the strengthening of the European Parliament and the
introduction of different forms of participatory democracy
\[26\].]{.underline}

[Nation states are not replaced or overcome in this scenario, but seen
as an example of how democracy can work, how dialogue and social
partnership can be organised. Although they lose their veto-power, they
are still crucial in decision making on the EU level as a kind of second
chamber. The power of governments is not being replaced, but
complemented by the power of citizens, through the further enhancement
of the European Parliament and new forms of participation such as
citizens' councils at EU level]{.underline} \[16\]. However, this
strengthening of the supranational level is only possible with the
consent and involvement of the trade unions so that the so called losers
of globalisation do not have to fear a further weakening of their
interests, but quite the opposite \[21\]. For this to succeed, social
dialogue is strengthened.

[At national level, aspects of political equality are strengthened:
transparency, representation and participation in parliaments and other
institutions of representative democracy are actively promoted \[34\].
However, this is not happening because of new sanity or goodwill of the
political parties, but because of public pressure arising from failures
and corruption scandals. The nepotism that surfaces in many states draws
public outrage and reform. These reforms are driven by examples where
party control and citizen participation]{.underline} succeed. [The
citizens\' councils and assemblies in Ireland, Belgium, French cities,
etc. \[53\] inspire other states and show that democratic innovations do
not have to remain elitist games, but that through certain and
constantly improved procedures, less privileged groups can also gain
access to political decision making]{.underline}. Strengthening
citizenship education and democratic competences, as defined by the
Council of Europe, in schools and educational institutions also plays an
important role \[32\].

[An attempt is made to create an ideal speech situation as described by
Habermas in different contexts. It means that all participants have the
same chance of initiation and participation in the debate. They evaluate
each other's assertion on the basis of reason and evidence and have an
interest in rational consensus.]{.underline} The point is to exclude
coercion from the debate as far as possible \[24\]. Even if there are
justified doubts about this theory of communicative action with regard
to its practicability and its many presuppositions, it can be considered
an ideal to approach. Structural and social hierarchies shall be limited
to a minimum. Especially at the local level, it is possible to improve
the dialogue between the different population groups and their different
interests \[14\].

[In this scenario, already existing structures are expanded, promoted
and funded by national and supranational authorities. This leads to
people having experiences of democracy in their immediate environment
that they would otherwise not have known. Bridge builders are
strengthened in their work. Social workers ensure that their clients are
empowered in their democratic competences. In this way, sections of the
population that are most exposed to the risks of globalisation can bring
their interests to bear, and it does not stop at articulation, but also
leads to visible consequences. This takes the wind out of the pushers'
sails. Although they remain an important factor in the democratic game,
they can no longer have the impact they had in scenario 1. The bridge
builders, on the other hand, become stronger and more, motivated and
encouraged by state institutions and laws that put an end to dangerous
inequality.]{.underline}

[Polarisation will not disappear in this scenario either, but it will be
turned in a direction that is less dangerous and includes the chance of
democratisation. In all measures, the concept of a relative, rebellious
cosmopolitanism is at the forefront, which is not dogmatic and attempts
to dialectically overcome the split between communitarian and
cosmopolitan positions through dialogue and inclusion. Without question,
this scenario is very demanding and therefore, at first glance,
extremely unlikely. Above all, it cannot be assumed that all the
measures mentioned will take place at all political levels at the same
time. Nevertheless, already existing initiatives can certainly be
strengthened by various actors. In the public debate, there is little
knowledge about successful democratic innovations of different
countries, regions or cities. If they receive more attention, this
scenario is also less absurd than it might seem at first
glance.]{.underline}

### No Existential Democracy Impacts

#### democracy can only produce smaller effects, not solve existential threats and impacts

, 22** (John, Carl Henrik, and Jonas, No month 2022, Annual Reviews,

[Democracy is a manipulable treatment only in the loosest sense.
Accordingly, when someone asserts, "Democracy causes Y," it is unclear
what aspect of democracy is affecting the outcome or if all aspects of
this composite concept are contributing equally.]{.underline} Nor is it
clear what the background (ceteris paribus) conditions are.

[In light of these difficulties]{.underline}, it might seem advisable to
re-specify the research question in a manner that comes closer to the
potential-outcomes vision of causality. For example[, one might focus on
specific components of democracy]{.underline} (e.g., multi-party
elections, universal suffrage) or types of democracy (e.g.,
presidentialism, federalism).

[**While a more narrowly defined research agenda holds promise, one must
appreciate that smaller interventions usually have smaller effects,**
making it more difficult to distinguish treatment effects from
background noise in the limited samples available.]{.underline}
Moreover, the various elements that compose the concept of democracy
interact with each other, making it difficult to analyze them
independently. Imagine a scenario in which 20 relevant elements are
associated with democracy, and the author chooses to focus on just one
that is of special theoretical interest. In this scenario, one would be
obliged to measure and condition on the other 19 to rule out potential
confounders---a daunting task.

#### No Solvency - The fact that democracies aren't unilateral and interact with each other just adds to the uncertainty of any solvency happening and democracy in general can be to random to depend on

**[The fact that political institutions interact with each other also
makes it challenging to aggregate up our understanding of the parts of
democracy into an understanding of the whole.]{.underline}** Political
systems exhibit strong holistic properties. During periods of regime
change, many of their component elements change together.

Thus, despite its ambiguities, the macro-level question of regimes
remains indispensable. [We need to know whether being governed by
democratic rules matters for outcomes that we care about.]{.underline}
We believe that it is possible to bring democracy into the
potential-outcomes framework so long as these ambiguities are recognized
and claims are suitably qualified by caveats. **[Specifically, we view
democracy as a composite variable that can, in some instances, be
considered as an as-if-random treatment.]{.underline}** One such
occasion is foreign intervention---either prodemocratic (e.g., the
Allied occupation and reconstruction of Germany and Japan) or
antidemocratic (e.g., the US-engineered coups in Chile and Iran).
Another occasion is when leaders accidentally inaugurate a democratic
transition (e.g., Gorbachev in the USSR) (Treisman 2020).

How might disinformation harm democracy? One possibility, which has
received extensive attention from policymakers and researchers, is that
disinformation may change election outcomes. This emphasis has serious
limitations. [First, concerns about disinformation changing electoral
outcomes may be overblown]{.underline}. There is an ongoing debate about
whether disinformation can significantly influence voting preferences
(Allcott and Gentzkow 2017; Guess, Nyhan, and Reifler 2018), in part
because [voting preferences tend to be relatively stable despite
campaign messaging]{.underline} (Kalla and Broockman 2018). [Second,
empirical research shows that disinformation campaigns are frequently
designed to achieve goals other than changing election outcomes, such as
undermining the institutions and social conditions necessary for
democracies to function]{.underline}. [Third, from a normative
perspective, democracy is not reducible to elections]{.underline}. As a
complement to an emphasis on electoral outcomes, we argue that a
deliberative democracy framework can help clarify the normative harms of
disinformation in ways that make sense of the growing empirical
literature on the tactics, aims, and outcomes of disinformation
campaigns.

### US Liberal Int'l Order Fails

#### **The U.S. strategy to strengthening the liberal order is simply outdated and has no way of solving as they promote exclusionary practices** 

**Beckley, Harvard international security fellow ,22**

\[Michael Beckley, 4/2022, Foreign Affairs, \"Enemies of My Enemy: How
Fear of China Is Forging a New World Order.,\",

Accessed 7-8-2022, LASA-LR\]

[For decades, the United States and its allies knew what they stood for
and who the enemy was. But then the Soviet Union collapsed, and a single
overarching threat gave way to a kaleidoscope of minor
ones]{.underline}. In the new and uncertain post-Cold War environment,
the Western allies sought refuge in past sources of success. [Instead of
building a new order, they doubled down on the existing
on]{.underline}e. [Their enemy may have disintegrated, but their
mission, they believed, remained the same:]{.underline} to enlarge the
community of free-market democracies. [For the next three decades, they
worked to expand the Western liberal order into a global one. NATO
membership nearly doubled]{.underline}. The European Community morphed
into the EU, a full-blown economic union with more than twice as many
member countries. The GATT was transformed into the World Trade
Organization (wro) and welcomed dozens of new members, unleashing an
unprecedented period of hyperglobalization.

[But it couldn\'t last. The liberal order, like all international
orders, is a form of organized hypocrisy that contains the seeds of its
own demise]{.underline}. [To forge a cohesive community, order builders
have to exclude hostile nations, outlaw uncooperative behaviors, and
squelch domestic opposition to international rule-makin]{.underline}g.
These inherently repressive acts eventually trigger a backlash. In the
mid-nineteenth century, it came in the form of a wave of liberal
revolutions, which eroded the unity and ideological coherence of the
monarchical Concert of Europe. [During the 1930s, aggrieved fascist
powers demolished the liberal interwar order that stood in the way of
their imperial ambitions. By the late 1940s, the Soviet Union had
spurned the global order it had helped negotiate just a few
years]{.underline} prior, having gobbled up territory in Eastern Europe
in contravention of the UN Charter.

[Many in the West had long assumed that the liberal order would be an
exception to the historical pattern]{.underline}. The system\'s
commitment to openness and nondiscrimination supposedly made it \"hard
to overturn and easy to join,\" as the political scientist G. John
Ikenberry argued in these pages in 2008. Any country, large or small,
could plug and play in the globalized economy. Liberal institutions
could accommodate all manner of members\--even illiberal ones, which
would gradually be reformed by the system into responsible stakeholders.
As more countries joined, a virtuous cycle would play out: free trade
would generate prosperity, which would spread democracy, which would
enhance international cooperation, which would lead to more trade. Most
important, the order faced no major opposition, because it had already
defeated its main enemy. The demise of Soviet communism had sent a clear
message to all that there was no viable alternative to democratic
capitalism.

**[These assumptions turned out to be wrong. The liberal order is, in
fact, deeply exclusionary.]{.underline}** By promoting free markets,
open borders, democracy, supranational institutions, and the use of
reason to solve problems, the order challenges traditional beliefs and
institutions that have united communities for centuries: state
sovereignty, nationalism, religion, race, tribe, family. [These enduring
ties to blood and soil were bottled up during the Cold War, when the
United States and its allies had to maintain a united front to contain
the Soviet Union]{.underline}. But they have reemerged over the course
of the post-Cold War era. [\"We are going to do a terrible thing to
you,\" the Soviet official Georgi Arbatov told a U.S. audience in 1988.
\"We are going to deprive you of an enemy.\" The warning proved
prescient. By slaying its main adversary, the liberal order unleashed
all sorts of nationalist, populist, religious, and authoritarian
opposition.]{.underline}

### Turn - Liberal International Order Inequality

#### Inequality and economic inequality are inherent in the Liberal International Order (LIO)

**Gerring et al., University of Texas at Austin Professor of Government,
University of Oslo Department of Political Science Research Professor,
Singapore Applied Technology Emerson Process Management Director,
, 22** (John, Carl Henrik, and Jonas, 5/2022, Annual Reviews, \"Does

Convergence Across Countries, Divergence Within Them

[The triumph of the LIO in the 1980s and 1990s---the collapse of
Communism, the dismantling of trade barriers, the strengthening of
institutions of international governance---coupled with, and facilitated
by, breakthrough innovations in transport, communication, and finance,
affected economic inequality in two ways that standard factor-endowment
theories predicted: inequality declined significantly between countries,
thus beginning to erode three centuries of the Great Divergence between
rich and poor nations**; but inequality within countries, especially
among the advanced economies, increased almost as
sharply.**]{.underline}

Between countries. [As late as 1990, the richest percent of the world\'s
population earned on average over ninety times what the poorest decile
received]{.underline}; only twenty years later, that ratio had fallen to
sixty-five times,or only slightly more than the within-country ratio of
Brazil, where in 2008 the average income of the richest decile was about
fifty times that of the poorest.

[Within countries. Beginning even earlier, inequality of
incomes]{.underline}, whether measured as the Gini index or the share of
total income accruing to the top decile, [has risen in virtually all of
the advanced economies, and indeed in many of the middle-income ones.
Bourguignon notes that the collapse of the Soviet empire and the opening
of China, India, and Latin America injected roughly "a billion workers,
for the most part unskilled, into international
competition."]{.underline} That will have drastically lowered the global
capital-labor ratio and hence further raised returns on human and
physical capital, while reducing those on low-skill labor, in virtually
all but the poorest, most labor-abundant countries.

[In short, across much of the globe**, the enormous overall gains from
trade have benefited the highly skilled, the inventive entrepreneurs,
and the owners of capital; the incomes of the less skilled and the
capital-poor have risen more slowly, stagnated, or actually
declined**]{.underline}---exactly the development whose early
manifestations alarmed Dani Rodrik two decades ago.

[Surely not all of the rise in inequality stems from
globalization]{.underline}. Many analyses attribute much of the widening
within-country gap---in the US, perhaps as much as four-fifths---not to
globalization but to skill-biased technological innovation. [Bourguignon
contends, to be sure, that innovation has been largely endogenous to
globalization: wider markets and intensified competition have raised the
returns on cost-reducing innovation. **Cheaper labor, however, whether
from offshoring or the competition of low-wage imports, might be
expected to curtail the demand for labor-saving technologies, not to
increase it.**]{.underline} A stronger case is implied by "new new"
trade theory: if managerial pay correlates closely with firm size, and
if the most successful firms in a globalized economy tend to be the
largest, it follows that globalization contributes directly to the rise
in top incomes.19 [Perhaps most importantly, however, whatever
skill-biased innovation may have contributed to the gains of the top
quintile or decile, it can say little about the gains of the top 1, or
0.1, percent of the distribution]{.underline}.**[Trade, as we argue, can
more readily explain those disproportionate gains.]{.underline}**

**that the growing "populist"1 backlash against the Liberal
International Order** (LIO)---not just the Trump victory but Brexit, the
election of illiberal governments in Hungary, Poland, Turkey, the
Philippines, and Brazil (to name only a few), and growing support for
anti-immigrant and illiberal parties and candidates in many other
democracies---**has followed almost inevitably from the very changes the
LIO has wrought, including of course increased trade and migration but
also one major concomitant, rising economic inequality within
states**]{.underline}**.** According to our traditional economic
theories,2 advanced and even middle-income countries are abundantly
endowed with human capital, and poorly endowed with low-skill labor.
[And it is a rudimentary implication of international economics that, in
those countries, expanded trade---or, even more, immigration of
low-skill workers---will benefit the highly skilled and harm the less
educated.]{.underline} Inequality will rise, and---perhaps the most
prescient conclusion of the traditional analysis---partisanship will
correlate increasingly with possession of human capital: opposition to
the LIO will be strongest among the least educated and will decrease
monotonically with more years of schooling.

#### The aff can't solve the underlying problem with the LIO which is that it INCREASES inequality which can lead to international conflict because of tensions (heg bad)

**Flaherty, University of California San Diego Political Science PhD
candidate and Rogowski, University of California Los Angeles Political
Science Distinguished Professor, 21** (Thomas M and Ronald , May
2021, International Organization; Cambridge International Organization;
Cambridge Vol. 75, Iss. 2, , \"Rising Inequality As a Threat to the
Liberal International Order\", DOI:10.1017/S0020818321000163,
Proquest, accessed on 7-8-2022, SR)

None of this suggests, of course, that rising inequality is the only, or
even necessarily the most important, cause of the growing popular
backlash against the LIO. Skill-biased technological innovation and
resistance to cultural change also matter, as we discuss more fully
later. [We do find, however, at least from a cursory analysis of
European elections, that backlash against shocks from immigration and
imports is conditional on high inequality]{.underline}, disappearing
where inequality is low; and we suspect that rising "top-heavy"
inequality is related to a particularly prominent strain, within the
antiglobalization movements, of anti-elite and anti-expert sentiment.

[We go on to suggest why rising inequality matters, not only as a source
of opposition to the LIO but as an impediment to economic growth and an
exacerbant of domestic polarization and international
conflict.]{.underline}

[Although relatively few studies suggest that \@emoeraey produces
undesirable consequences, results from the surveyed studies are
inconclusive for the outcomes of fiscal policy, infrastructure and
industry, investment, social transfer programs, and disaster
preparedness. **For inequality, inflation, and public spending, there is
no case for democracy producing desirable outcomes**]{.underline},
according to the metrics in Table 3

[t has refused, so far, to remove Trump's tariffs on China, a step that
would help ease inflation, for fear of surrendering a diplomatic
advantage. This turns the post-Cold War norm on its head: Calculations
of geopolitical risk are now trumping calculations of economic
efficiency.]{.underline} To be sure, interdependence is hardly a thing
of the past. US trade in goods with China was more than \$650 billion
last year, and American companies such as Tesla nc. and Apple nc. are
doing more, not less, business with Beijing.

But [the basic trend is toward a more balkanized global economy, in
which key rivals aim to seal off dangerous vulnerabilities and
manipulate the terms of interdependence to their advantage.]{.underline}
And if recent experience is any indication, this process will happen
gradually until it happens rapidly --- when a grave crisis erupts, as in
Ukraine, and sunders ties that had seemed unbreakable not long before.

Structurally speaking, the US is well positioned. [**America and the
other advanced democracies possess a clear majority of global production
and wealth.** If they, plus key developing states such as India, deepen
their integration with each other while limiting it with their rivals,
**they can create a free-world economy more vibrant than anything China,
let alone Russia, can muster.**]{.underline}

### Turn -- Self Censorship

#### Always focusing on fake news instills a culture of self-censorship

First[, the widespread use of the term "fake news" combined with
concerns over national security]{.underline} (although often sincere and
well-meaning) [have given illiberal and authoritarian-leaning
governments around the world top cover to enact a range of
censorship-enabling measures that are then used to crack down on
dissent, target political opponents and instill a culture of
self-censorship.]{.underline} In the Philippines --- where President
Rodrigo Duterte continues to prosecute a "war on drugs" that has led to
the deaths of thousands --- penalties for spreading false and alarming
information were included in a special measures bill to combat COVID-19.
Critics of the bill warn that it will be selectively used to punish
political opponents and deter dissent. [Last year, Singapore --- which
has continually ranked poorly for press freedom --- also passed a law
targeting "fake news" and false information. Citing examples of foreign
interference in the United States and the United Kingdom, Singapore
justified the bill on the grounds of national security. **Borrowing a
common refrain from the West, the government stated that falsehoods
"weaponised, to attack the infrastructure of fact, destroy trust and
attack societies."**]{.underline} Now Nigeria, again in the name of
national security, is mulling its own bill targeting false information,
which has widely been mocked as a copy-paste of Singapore's law.

### Turn -- Repressive Policies

[Third, **an overemphasis on "bad actors" and their supply of
disinformation diverts our attention from the material problems that
drive our demand for and receptivity to dubious content of suspicious
origin**. In a commentary for the Harvard Kennedy School's
Misinformation Review,]{.underline} Alexei Abrahams and I **[argue that
thus far the focus of the West's countermeasures in the fight against
misinformation and disinformation has relied on repressive
strategies]{.underline}** --- root out the networks, shut down the
accounts and remove the content. [However, this strategy is, as many
have pointed out already, a never-ending "game of whack-a-mole" that (at
best) provides short-term tactical gains.]{.underline} These palliative
measures must be coupled with long-term solutions that take aim at the
reasons why people flock to fringe websites and dubious accounts for
their news[. It is not that we want to be lied to, but rather that our
trust in the institutions and authorities to which we delegate our
well-being and future has eroded]{.underline}. [As such, redressive
strategies should also be explored to regain and restore trust and
legitimacy in our institutions, politicians and governing bodies. And,
where possible, domestic policy should be directed at making democratic
participation easier. **"Bad actors" will always be around and try to
mess with information systems, but we can choose to make voting easier,
prevent gerrymandering, and amend or repeal laws that lead to voter
suppression**. []{.mark}]{.underline}

### Democracy Bad for Environment

#### Democracy effectively hurts the environment through monopolizing the environment simply for economic results

**Akalin and Edrogan, Dumlupinar University department of economics ,
Sakarya University Vocational School, 20**

\[Guray Akalin and Sinan Edrogan , 10-7-2020, Environmental Science and
Pollution Research, \"Does democracy help reduce environmental
degradation?,\", <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11096-1>,

Although most SDG researches have focused on the economic growth and
environment nexus, the institutions and environment nexus have largely
remained unexplored. Particularly, how democracy and environment
interact was not made clear as well; and, different approaches asserted
by researchers to unveil the theoretical background of
democracy-environment nexus. Olson (1996) [states that compatibility
nexus between democracy and economic growth means that democracy
increases economic growth as well as resource use; hence, it can be said
that democracy does not promote actions on diminishing environmental
pollutions and emissions. In other words, democracy creates a better
investment climate by protecting private property rights and promoting
individual entrepreneurship, which boosts economic growth, raises
resource use, and hurts the environmental quality.]{.underline} Hillman
and Ursprung (1992) stated that the effect of democracy on the
environment varies by depending on the institutional mechanism of policy
choice. The majority of society determines the policies in case of the
existence of direct democracy. Therefore, environmental policies are
determined by median voters, and policy-makers cannot adopt policies
based on discretion. However, the policy-makers adopt discretion-based
policies in case of representative democracy. [The existence of
representative democracy could lead to the arise of principal-agent
problems. In such a case, individuals cannot monitor policies determined
by agents, and decisions of policy-makers can be affected by lobby
groups. Dryzek (1987) asserts that democracy is a regime in which
lobbying groups seeking profit maximization have a significant political
impact. Thus, the government might be affected by lobbying and may
prioritize private interests over the public interest (Olson 1982). In
contrast, autocratic regimes might deny lobbying demands that hurt
environmental quality in favor of the public interest.]{.underline}
Beyond that, because of political myopia, democratically elected
governments might also be more lacking in commitment to long-term action
plans than nonelected autocratic regimes (Bernauer and Koubi 2009). In
other words, pollution abatement requires long-term commitment, and
democratically elected governments might be unwilling to choose policies
that limit resource use and slow economic growth down instead of
vote-saving policies such as boosting economic growth. [Therefore,
democratically elected governments might be less successful in providing
public goods such as a clean environment than nonelected
regimes.]{.underline}

#### Democracy incentivizes economic growth and prioritizes it over the environment, allowing for terrible degrading effects to ensue on the environment as a result

**Akalin and Edrogan, Dumlupinar University department of economics ,
Sakarya University Vocational School, 20**

\[Guray Akalin and Sinan Edrogan , 10-7-2020, Environmental Science and

degradation?,\", https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11096-1,

In the first part of our analysis, we performed cross-sectional
dependency and homogeneity tests, which revealed that there is a
cross-sectional dependence in the panel model and the slope coefficients
are heterogeneous. To estimate the long-term relationship between
variables, we used the AMG approach in the second part of our analysis.
[The AMG estimation results and its corresponding policy implications
are as follows: an increase in economic growth decreases environmental
quality. To eliminate the environmental cost of economic growth, it
would be better to adopt a more inclusive and eco-friendly development
approach that substitutes pollutant-production technology based on
nonrenewable resources, with technologies that use eco-friendly
renewable resources]{.underline}.

[Democracy has an aggravating effect on environmental degradation.
Therefore, the regulatory agencies could reduce the adverse effect of
democracy on the environment by limiting the power of lawmakers to
permit excessive resource use]{.underline}. [Thus, by deflecting the
impact of private economic interests through government regulation, the
adverse effect of democracy on the environment would be
reduced]{.underline}. In addition, to ensure the sustainability of
environmental policies, governments should declare an "ecological
constitution," which is not affected by political elections and thus
cannot be easily changed. Furthermore, decision-makers should create new
platforms for demanding environmental improvements and ensure that
inspection mechanisms are put in place to monitor these changes.

[Whether in coordination or not, China and Russia will undoubtedly
continue to challenge allies in domains like space and cyber using
emerging and emerged technologies. Dealing with such challenges is core
NATO business --- grounded in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty and
resting primarily with national authorities]{.underline}. [The new
Strategic Concept should aim to integrate these relatively new domains
while responding to disruptive technologies as well. Allies must
endeavor to reach a "pre-crisis" consensus on what space and cyber
actions would constitute an "armed attack" in accordance with Article 5.
This kind of crisis decision-making is a core function of NATO's
political and military headquarters]{.underline}. Such agreement, when
paired with improved national capabilities, would contribute to
deterrence by communicating resolve to adversaries. Improved
capabilities themselves will only arise through public-private
partnership to maintain a technological edge. [A common strategic
culture of innovation, much of which arises from the private sector, is
a key advantage that NATO has --- and should retain --- over its
adversaries. Such innovation has been on display in the Russo-Ukrainian
war and will doubtless be essential in future conflicts.]{.underline}

National Resilience [Although defending human and physical
infrastructure from asymmetric threats is inherently national business,
NATO itself can serve as a platform for coordinating allied responses to
these challenges. NATO allies agreed on seven baseline requirements for
national resilience at their 2016 Warsaw Summit. They have also
"improve\[d\] their cyber resilience by introducing capability targets"
into the NATO Defence Planning Process.]{.underline}

[Recently, however, national resilience has been challenged in
additional areas, which should be reflected. Specifically, NATO should
address democratic backsliding, election interference, and economic and
information manipulation. Specifically, NATO's requirements for national
resilience should be upgraded to require national safeguards against
democratic backsliding. Prior to taking up her position as the senior
U.S. Department of Defense official in Europe, Rachel Ellehuus
highlighted the vulnerabilities laid bare by such backsliding and argued
that "the trans-Atlantic alliance will only remain strong if members
genuinely abide by its founding principles."]{.underline} By
incorporating such safeguards into NATO's systems for monitoring allies'
defense preparations, allies can shape one another's political,
economic, and security incentives in ways that reduce these
vulnerabilities.

[Allies should also agree to reduce dramatically their reliance on
non-allied energy --- the vulnerabilities inherent in German dependence
on Russian gas have been exposed during the Russo-Ukrainian war.
Progress toward independence cannot come fast enough. Finally,
non-allied ownership of critical infrastructure, especially
transportation and telecommunications, poses risks that have not yet
materialized in the same way as energy dependency but are just as
dangerous]{.underline}. [The risks should be explicitly addressed in the
strategic concept, and concrete steps toward mitigation should increase
accordingly. Military mobility remains a critical infrastructural
challenge that allies should also explicitly grapple with in
coordination with the European Union.]{.underline} [As in the cyber
realm, the NATO Defence Planning Process may be an appropriate venue for
these efforts.]{.underline}

The logic of interpreting how disinformation gets securitized by relying
on NATO documents is two-fold: first, [NATO has been evolving to find
new *raisons d'être* since the end of the Cold War and has sought to
capitalize on the securitization of new threats, such as]{.underline}
terrorism, [cybersecurity,]{.underline} Syria, and forced migration.^38^
[Disinformation and information war are two of the recent additions to
this threat portfolio]{.underline} that helps us understand how NATO's
discourses on security adapt to a new-medium threat. Second, it enables
us to understand how [institutional security arrangements like NATO
reinvent their security identities and construct their amity-enmity
relations in light of newer technologies.]{.underline} Since identity
and action are considered closely linked in constructivism, and because
they are never fixed or intrinsic, but are rather fluid and constituted
through social processes, studying longitudinal securitization dynamics
gives us valuable insight into long-term NATO security planning.^39^

[Critics of Western disinformation discourses]{.underline}, for example,
[argue that such discourses have turned into 'floating (or empty)
signifiers' that have no specific or agreed-upon
meaning.]{.underline}^12^ [In that vein, blaming others for engaging in
disinformation often detracts attention from a mistake or failed policy
enacted by the blamer.]{.underline}^13^ In this case, critics argue that
[Western discourses on disinformation are intended to distract attention
from NATO or EU divisions, or more domestic-level polarization dynamics,
by creating a unique empty signifier (disinformation) to be employed as
a rallying rhetoric that bolsters the significance of external
threats.]{.underline}^14^ In this way, [disinformation and its
associated terms, like misinformation, fake news, and information war,
get securitized, receiving disproportionate levels of attention in the
policy domain.]{.underline} In this context, [disinformation and its
associated terms are used to exaggerate an existing threat and create a
rallying discourse meant to channel the attention of divided Western
nations away from their internal disagreements and towards an inflated
external threat.]{.underline} Some scholars go even further, arguing
that disinformation is being securitized in the West (especially in
NATO) to the extent that the 'war on terror' was securitized through the
2000s.^15^ In this line, [disinformation is alleged to have become a new
strategic glue intended to help Western nations pool together their
increasingly diverging interests and resources in support of a common
cause.]{.underline}^16^

Securitization of disinformation in domestic politics is relatively
well-studied.^17^ Although these terms entered mainstream debates after
the 2016 US elections, [former President Donald Trump, too, securitized
fake news to delegitimize his opponents by constructing rival
disinformation as a national security problem, indirectly attributable
to China.]{.underline}^18^ Following the tornado of accusations in the
US, [political actors in Britain, France, Italy, South Africa, Kenya and
others have begun blaming each other for engaging in organized
disinformation.]{.underline}^19^ Even in Sweden, [there is empirical
evidence that suggests accusing journalists of spreading fake news
results in the self-censorship of such outlets.]{.underline}^20^ There
are further cases of evidence supporting the claim that [elite-level
discourses on disinformation have a direct effect on how society
perceives information and facts in general, creating a measurable effect
on public trust towards such facts and information.]{.underline}^21^ [In
Singapore]{.underline}, for example, [delegitimizing rival parties and
news outlets through disinformation discourse is considered 'acceptable'
as part of the state's duty to discipline the opposition and its
political actors.]{.underline}^22^ [Similar trends emerging in
democracies and authoritarian countries alike, such as in Austria,
Australia, Poland, Russia, and South Africa, demonstrate the
universality of instrumentalizing disinformation discourse as a

Over the last few years, [defining misleading content and measuring the
legitimacy of its dissemination have been at the forefront
of]{.underline} journalistic, political, and scientific
[debates.]{.underline}^24^ Even before its proliferation in 2016,
disinformation was a widely-used term in mainstream discourse,
co-existing with other terms such as infoglut, or information
overload.^25^ While disinformation and misinformation were first used
interchangeably, today, [disinformation refers to the deliberate
dissemination of false information with the intention of misleading and
confusing an audience. Misinformation, on the other hand, strictly
refers to the unintended diffusion of false information without
malintent.]{.underline} There are also bridge terms such as
'malinformation', which refers to information that is factually accurate
but is deployed to damage the image of an individual or an entity, or
the concept of 'problematic information' as defined by Caroline
Jack.^26^ Although it is not directly mentioned, all of [these concepts
refer to the digital space, where information manipulation is
disseminated faster and more broadly on social media and digital
communication technologies as compared to other forms of
media]{.underline}.

As the terms '[disinformation/misinformation', 'fake news', 'information
operation', and 'hybrid war' are often used interchangeably in political
discourse]{.underline}, [there are little clear-cut differences in the
strategic meaning of each word choice.]{.underline}^27^ Politicians and
[leaders]{.underline} often [use these terms as a bag of buzzwords
without a clear operational definition of what each term precisely
means]{.underline}. [All of these buzzwords generate roughly the same
effect, the delegitimization of their target, on consumers of such
messages]{.underline}.^28^ Especially problematic is the \*fact that
[once the discourse on disinformation is weaponized to delegitimize
rivals, there is very little such rivals can do to defend themselves.
Given the significant political charge of these terms, individuals or
institutions that are alleged to be engaging in disinformation-related
activities often have to enter into a fruitless spar of words to
challenge such allegations, which usually leads to further
controversy.]{.underline} [This renders the accuser -- or the side that
securitizes disinformation -- more advantageous compared to the accused,
generating a dynamic similar to the 'attacker's advantage' in cyber
security,]{.underline} where the defender is continuously
blindsided.^29^

Therefore, [the securitization of disinformation -- that is,
discursively constructing disinformation as a security concern -- is
becoming almost as controversial as disinformation itself, and can often
be deployed to muddle the waters of a healthy debate.]{.underline} Its
problem lies within its success; namely, how successfully disinformation
gets securitized and rallies policy resources around itself. This fits
into Buzan et. al.'s criteria for a 'successful speechact', which should
take place in a medium most appropriate for its dissemination and have a
clear, mobilizable referent object (i.e. 'those that spread
disinformation').^30^ [By securitizing disinformation in the medium that
is most conducive for its dissemination (social media and the Internet),
speakers get a chance to use the speed and volume advantage of digital
communication technologies against their opponents.]{.underline} [Also,
such discursive constructions must be sedimented (1) rhetorically: have
a clear argumentative function, (2) discursively: contain clear power
and hegemonic relations within, (3) culturally: refer to a well-known
case or instance, and (4) institutionally: in a way that mobilizes
policy resources.]{.underline}^31^

Yet, for the Copenhagen school, [not all speech acts constitute
securitization]{.underline}. [Securitization is a very particular
discursive construct that designates a specific existential threat
requiring the mobilization of uncommon resources and measures that go
beyond the norms of institutional and political
responses.]{.underline}^32^ In many cases, [securitization happens to
trigger and facilitate these institutional changes by 'shocking' power
brokers and bureaucracies into action, either through internal
bureaucratic peer pressure, or through public opinion
pressure]{.underline} (audience costs). As such, [disinformation has
been lifted 'above politics' in Western rhetoric as a peculiar threat
that requires the sidelining of daily political squabbles, mobilizing
unique resources, and addressing it in unity that would otherwise not
materialize.]{.underline}^33^ Ultimately, [the discursive constructions
of disinformation constitute acute cases of securitization as they
generate amity-enmity relations only among countries that adopt this
discursive strategy.]{.underline}^34^

#### The securitization of disinformation discredits competitors by portraying oneself as the sole source of truth.

Since then, strategic communicative actions that are intended to
influence, mislead, and confuse foreign populations have assumed a
central position in global debates about politics and foreign policy.
Given the impact of such actions on elections, polarization, and crisis
management, it was natural for the rhetoric about these actions to
assume such a central position.^6^ However, over time, [popular

mainstream discourse, assuming an accusatory nature worldwide as more
leaders, diplomats, and politicians have begun using them to discredit
and delegitimize their political opponents.]{.underline} This dynamic
was later conceptualized as '[discursive deflection'^7^ and has become
acutely visible in the foreign policy domain as more countries have
begun securitizing the concepts 'fake news', 'disinformation', and
'information warfare' to similarly discredit and delegitimize rival
countries.]{.underline}^8^ Broadly speaking, ['discursive-deflection' is
the strategy of discrediting competitors and rivals by portraying
oneself as the sole source of truth.]{.underline} While the domestic
political use of these terms is well-studied, we are still somewhat in
the dark with regard to why countries choose to securitize these terms
and what happens in their interactions with other countries when they do
so.

### Security K -- NATO Disinformation Policy Link

The logic of interpreting how disinformation gets securitized by relying
on NATO documents is two-fold: first, [NATO has been evolving to find
new *raisons d'être* since the end of the Cold War and has sought to
capitalize on the securitization of new threats, such as]{.underline}
terrorism, [cybersecurity,]{.underline} Syria, and forced migration.^38^
[Disinformation and information war are two of the recent additions to
this threat portfolio]{.underline} that helps us understand how NATO's
discourses on security adapt to a new-medium threat. Second, it enables
us to understand how [institutional security arrangements like NATO
reinvent their security identities and construct their amity-enmity
relations in light of newer technologies.]{.underline} Since identity
and action are considered closely linked in constructivism, and because
they are never fixed or intrinsic, but are rather fluid and constituted
through social processes, studying longitudinal securitization dynamics
gives us valuable insight into long-term NATO security planning.^39^

#### Link -- The language NATO uses to securitize disinformation reflects a discursive anchoring in United States institutional influence.

The differences between NATO official texts and tweets are particularly
interesting. [Although NATO official texts shift from a 'hybrid
war'-focused discourse to 'disinformation' focused discourse by 2018,
the reliance on 'disinformation' discourse in tweets is
more]{.underline} striking. By late 2016 (the US elections[),
'disinformation' becomes a clear discursive choice in NATO tweets,
skyrocketing in much of 2020 due to COVID and vaccine-related
securitization discourses globally. This could be interpreted as the
discursive anchoring capacity of the United States for NATO, as the
constructions of securitization in American political culture affects
the wider institutional discourse of NATO. Perhaps as the clearest sign
of the temporal variations in word choice shifts, NATO's Twitter
accounts use the words 'disinformation', 'information warfare', and
'misinformation' overwhelmingly more often in comparison with its
official texts and statements, which rely more on 'cyber war' and
'hybrid war'.]{.underline} As for NATO and affiliated accounts that use
the keyword 'disinformation', four clear accounts stand out. These are
\@STRATCOMCOE (NATO Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence),
\@NATOmoscow (NATO Information Office Moscow), \@NATOBrazeB (NATO
Assistant Secretary General for Public Diplomacy), and \@NATOpress
(Official Twitter account of the \@NATO Spokesperson). As for which NATO
country representations use this word the most, Latvia (@LV_NATO),
Lithuania (@LitdelNATO), United States (@ USNATO), Ukraine
(@NATOinUkraine) and Germany (@GermanyNATO) stand out the most.

Overall, our analysis has shown that [NATO still defines its security
identity against Russia, and there has not been a significant shift in
NATO's securitization dynamics since the Cold War, as evidenced by our
comparative analysis of older and newer NATO texts]{.underline}.
[Although Chinese disinformation attempts have also begun to enter
NATO's threat-related language, the organization's primary discursive
security identity continues to develop against and around Russia. This
is most evident in our longitudinal analysis of the pre- and post 2014
documents that similarly prioritize Russia as a threat, implying that it
is not really the disinformation or fake news agenda that is rendering
Russia a threat for NATO.]{.underline} This bolsters the hypothesis that
[even if technologies change, the NATO-Russia rivalry will remain
securitized in the same way.]{.underline} In other words, [the
contemporary disinformation and fake news agenda is a continuation of
the same NATO-Russia rivalry]{.underline} -- at least in discursive form
-- [through newer mediums.]{.underline}

### Security K -- Impact -- Turns Democracy

#### Securitizing disinformation undermines democratic institutions

**Tenove, University of British Columbia Department of Political Science
Fellow, 20** 

(Chris, 07-2020, The International Journal of Press/Politics,
\"Protecting Democracy from Disinformation: Normative Threats and Policy
Responses", https://doi.org/10.11772F1940161220918740, p. 524 & 525,

'[Treating disinformation as a national security threat often makes
sense. Disinformation tactics could undermine a people\'s capacity to
enact its decisions via their democratic government]{.underline} (such
as by fabricating orders from public officials), [or compromise a
people\'s ability to contribute to rule making]{.underline} (such as by
circulating news ofa natural disaster on a voting day). [Furthermore,
foreign governments can mobilize enormous resources, and so governments
may similarly need to martial their capacities to coun- teract
them]{.underline}. Indeed, only state security agencies have the
combination of signals intelligence and human intelligence needed to
discover coordinated and covert disin- formation campaigns. 

[**However, security agencies have fraught relationships with
democracy.** Their inter- ference in domestic political affairs can lead
to excessive influence in democratic pro- cesses by the governing party
or by security agencies themselves.]{.underline} A national security
logic may unduly interpret false or partly false communications as
security risks, rather than as opportunities for correction and debate.
[As Farrell and Schneier (2018) observe, national security frameworks
tend to see opportunities for contentious com- 'munication as
vulnerabilities rather than virtues:]{.underline} "This means thatthe
national security approach has enormous difficulties in assessing the
appropriate trade-offs that are needed to guarantee a well-functioning
democracy" (p. 5). 

Moreover, [a national security-focused approach can shift policy making
and espe- cially policy enforcement to government agencies that tend to
be under weak demo- cratic control.]{.underline} **The national security
agencies of many countries "are typically subject to** limited oversight
and accountability, and are historically separated from the citi- zenry
by secrecy, hierarchy, and **[virtually unchecked executive
power]{.underline}**" (Deibert 2018: 413). [This issue can be seen in
struggles by journalism organizations to report on security agencies,
even in countries with strong protections for a free press]{.underline}
(Lidberg and Muller 2018). 

**[The repressive use of national security laws against disinformation
by authoritar- jan countries is well-documented (Henley 2018), but
concerns have also been raised about security policies in
democracies.]{.underline}** One example is Taiwan's response to poten-
tial Chinese disinformation operations. In the lead-up to the 2020
election, Taiwan passed the Anti-Infiltration Act that targets foreign
interference through disinformation, lobbying, and other means
(Aspinwall 2020). The government also pressured its National
Communications Commission to crack down on domestic news organizations
for false and biased reporting that may advance China's influ- ence. The
former head of the Commission, who allegedly resigned because she did
not agree with this crackdown, warned, "[The government says
disinformation is the enemy of an open and democratic society . . . But
we don't want to lose that open. society by fighting against
it]{.underline}" (Aspinwall 2020). 

## EU CP

### EU CP Solvency

#### The EU should adopt a pooling of capabilities on a voluntary basis

**Liederkerke, Rasmussen Global Policy Advisor and Laudrain, Centre for
Doctoral Training in Cybersecurity Department of Politics and
International Relations Research Student, 22** 

(Arthur and Arthur, 3-30-2022, Council on Foreign Relations, \"Russia's
Cyber War: What's Next and What the European Union Should
Do.\", https://www.cfr.org/blog/russias-cyber-war-whats-next-and-what-european-union-should-do, accessed
on 7-7-2022, SR)

[Contrary to widespread expectations, the use of cyberweaponry in the
Russian war with Ukraine has so far been limited.]{.underline} To date,
the only significant, sophisticated operations with suspected Russian
involvement are the attacks on communications giant Viasat's satellite
networks, attempts to install data-wiping malware on Ukrainian
government systems, and attacks against two major Ukrainian
telecommunications firms.

[There are several reasons that can plausibly explain why cyber
operations have remained marginal in the conflict. First, the Ukrainians
have done a good job at bolstering their digital defenses, helped in
part by their American allies. There are also the inherent limitations
of cyberattacks: in an all-out kinetic war, missiles offer a faster and
more effective means of achieving strategic objectives than lines of
code.]{.underline}

Last, but certainly not least, it is worth remembering that we are in
the early stages of a war that will drag on, potentially for months,
leaving plenty of time for new Russian cyber operations. [Apparent
reluctance to use cyber capabilities beyond limited operational-level
hits or disinformation campaigns may well abate as fears of spillover or
retaliatory Western cyber responses diminish. **The European Union (EU)
must act now, while the intensity of cyber conflict outside Ukraine is
still relatively low, to bolster its defenses and prepare for the
specter of wide-ranging, damaging cyber operations later in the
conflict.**]{.underline}

Cyber and information warfare: The cornerstone of Russia's next move?

[Even if the Russians agree to a truce, cyber and disinformation efforts
would be one of the few avenues available to them to inflict damage on
Ukraine in the gray zone below the threshold of direct
confrontation.]{.underline} As the Russian military shifts its
objectives, resources and bandwidth will be freed up to fight from the
rear. A cornered Moscow--with few other options left on the table--is
likely to resort to the cyber domain, as other pariah states have done,
as the ideal vector to circumvent isolation, spy on and disrupt Western
defense plans, steal technology and intellectual property it will be cut
off from, and heighten its global nuisance with disinformation
operations. Recent attacks on a major Ukrainian telecommunications firm,
Ukrtelecom, have heightened fears that Russia's stalling military
campaign could cause it to turn to cyber operations as another means of
achieving its aims.

What should the European Union do in the immediate term?

[The EU has adopted new frameworks, including its much vaunted Strategic
Compass, which, in the long term, will improve cybersecurity in the
bloc, and potentially reduce the risk of catastrophic Russian
cyberattacks. **However, the EU needs to take more steps in the short
term to shore up cyber defenses and mitigate the threat of Russian cyber
operations.**]{.underline}

[First, the EU should get its own house in order.]{.underline} The
revised Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive--better known
in Brussels circles as NIS 2--should be finalized in the coming months
and will aim to further strengthen the security of supply chains,
streamline incident reporting obligations, and introduce more stringent
supervisory measures for a large number of operators of essential
services and enterprises across the EU. While NIS 2 represents a step in
the right direction, the EU still has some way to go in implementing
harmonized cybersecurity rules across the bloc's own institutions.

[Second, the EU and its Member States have a role to play in
discouraging and deterring cyberattacks by demonstrating a willingness
to act and impose costs on perpetrators.]{.underline} The first-ever
operational deployment of the EU's Cyber Rapid Response Team to Ukraine,
alongside similar teams from the United States, was a welcome signal in
this respect. One way to impose further costs would be by pushing for
coordinated attribution of cyberattacks at the EU-level**. [On the
offensive and deterrent side, the EU should adopt a pooling of
capabilities on a voluntary basis.]{.underline}** [Similar programs
already exist among other groups, such as NATO's Sovereign Cyber Effects
Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) program, which the EU could use
as a model for its own programs.]{.underline}

[Third, the EU should ensure it is better prepared by leveraging the
tools it already has at its disposal.]{.underline} Intelligence sharing
and situational awareness have proven vital before and during the war in
Ukraine, but the future effectiveness of these strategies in deterring
and mitigating cyberattacks will be reliant on Member States willingness
to contribute with timely and actionable intelligence. In the short
term, the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe), a
recently created group bringing together the executives of the EU's
twenty seven national cybersecurity authorities, should be used to its
full capability and integrated with the rest of the EU cyber ecosystem.
CyCLONe, with their wealth of operational-level expertise, should be
able to brief political decision-makers in the Council more frequently[.
On the military side, the EU still lacks a fully fleshed-out cooperation
mechanism for military cybersecurity alerts, despite this being an
objective since the 2014 EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework. Ensuring
cooperation among both civilian and military groups is vital given the
specter of Russian cyberattacks.]{.underline}

Supporting Ukraine is every democracy's duty. [Russia will attempt to
undermine this support through cyberattacks and other means. The EU
needs to shore up its cyber defenses at home to ensure all Members can
continue to aid Ukraine in the future.]{.underline}

[It is only through an effective US and EU collaboration on the issue of
regulatory reform and disinformation countermeasures that we can set
meaningful baseline norms]{.underline}, [avoid a regulatory patchwork,
duplication of efforts and overcome jurisdiction conflicts]{.underline}.
The US and the EU should also lead the effort of convergence in terms of
data protection. Security and privacy are intertwined.

[While in the EU data-driven disinformation campaigns have ignited
debates about data governance, the US is slowly but surely joining
in]{.underline}. Data is crucial in campaigning. According to Brendan
Fischer, director of federal reform at Campaign Legal Center in the US,
'you have organizations that are supposed to be operating independently
of candidates, sharing data with candidates which in many ways is more
valuable than giving them money'.172

[The two sides of the Atlantic do not share perfectly aligned positions
on notions of privacy,173 but the EU's GDPR displays normative power,
with legal experts and policymakers in the US considering its
merits]{.underline}. Nevertheless, establishing a balance between
meaningful and comprehensive data subject rights on one hand, with a
public and private surveillance infrastructure seen as vital to national
security, will be extremely challenging.

This paper recommends that a [hybrid model of education and retaliation
be adopted to slow the spread of disinformation]{.underline}. [Canada
needs to adopt a policy in line with NATO that could provide the time
for the creation a long-term approach in the form of education. While
retaliation will buy time, the existing monitoring apparatus coupled
with working with allies to implement a widespread education initiative
could achieve lasting positive results.61]{.underline}

Other nations are under threat from disinformation; [NATO has offered to
work with Canada to develop a database that could be shared across the
alliance]{.underline}.62[Not only would sharing the database
dramatically decrease the individual cost burden, but it would also
provide exceptionally more data points to identify what disinformation
is]{.underline}.63Any algorithm is only as accurate as the data input
within; therefore, the data input rate is directly correlated to the
accuracy of a properly trained AI.64[Further, the use of allied powers
would help regain public trust as it would legitimize Canadian actions
in the larger context]{.underline}.65Ultimately, [Canada needs a
cohesive strategy that uses existing infrastructure where possible and
allied help when offered to win against this increasingly widespread
foe]{.underline}. Further, given NATO has sanctioned Russia for
offensive military actions in the Ukraine. It is reasonable that using
various sanctions as a form non-kinetic retaliation is a strategy that
is in line with NATO's existing precedent against Russia.

### Canada CP - Middle Power Leadership NB

#### Now key time for Canadian middle power leadership within multinational institutions

**Rashchupkina, Faculty, Political Science and School of Climate Change

[The US has signaled a retreat from its efforts aimed at promoting
nation-building and pro- tecting human rights and democracy worldwide,
while China has yet to demonstrate any commitment to embracing the human
rights and democracy aspects of the liberal inter- national
order]{.underline} (LIO[). These developments and]{.underline} the
[great power competition]{.underline} between the US and China
[undermine the LIO, so, reaffirmed commitments to multilateralism are
needed]{.underline} (Emmers, 2018). The [middle power states are
believed to at least slow the disin- tegration of LIO if not halt its
deterioration altogether]{.underline} (Paris, 2019).

The rise of China, its approach to international politics, and the
US-China competition over establishing and maintaining international
rules pose a challenge to Canada, along with other middle power states.
Canada faces a choice to either take a hardline approach to China,
risking economic losses to the Canadian economy, or to continue a policy
of engagement, thus potentially increasing the risks of heavy dependence
on China and further legitimizing China\'s antidemocratic leadership
internationally. Significant confron- tational measures around trade and
investments toward China could harm the Canadian exporting industries of
wood pulp, vehicles, fish, mineral fuels, fertilizers and food. In the
past, the Canadian government decided not to retaliate when, after Ms.
Meng\'s arrest, China imposed a de facto ban on imports of Canadian
canola, pork, beef and soya. The Foreign Affairs Minister of Canada
initiated the adoption of the Declaration Against Arbitrary Detention in
State-to-State Relations; however, while the document condemns
governments-sponsored arbitrary detentions, it does not imply any
economic sanctions for this behavior. Trudeau\'s government has not
formally banned Huawei from its 5G net- works even though the United
States, Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, the other four
members of the Five Eyes intelligence network, have done so.

In this contribution, the author argues [that Canada, a middle power
state and tra- ditional ally of the US, cannot afford to unilaterally
take coercive measures against China]{.underline} in the realm of
protecting human rights and democracy; it is too dependent on trade,
investment and science-related collaboration with China. [Canada can,
however, promote a less unilateralist, more globalist attitude toward
international politics. It can play a more active role in improving the
work of the existing multilateral institutions and emerging
partnerships, while also contributing to shifting the US\'s foreign
policy pri- orities toward more collaborative solutions and approaches
in international affairs.]{.underline}

Education could also be achieved by maintaining a database of
disinformation, as well as forcing government employees to complete
courses that address disinformation.35 The goal of the database would
first and foremost be to prevent the government from spreading
disinformation accidentally; and secondly, to offer educational tools to
the public.36 The creation of a database is recommended by NATO and also
supported by the Global Engagement Center, with the goal of keeping this
database open to the public and allied governments.37 The creation of
this data base is at this time theoretically but likely on going through
American and Estonian efforts.38 The risk is that these tools will not
stand up to opposing actor adaptation because several reports indicate
that the Russian and Chinese governments already understand how nations
react to disinformation much better than the experts who write the
policies in western nations.39 Thus, a publicly available database would
maximize the value of education, while at the same time prevents
government entities from spreading opposing actor disinformation
unintentionally.40 There are many instances of Russian and Chinese
disinformation being spread by government agencies located in Canada and
the United States showing the importance of educating all levels of
Canadian and American government.41

NATO has been experimenting with how to inflict a cost to opposing actor
operations, and from such activities what emerged were two competing
theories. First, fight disinformation with disinformation, and the
second theory suggests using asset forfeiture of these sites where
possible, targeting websites and generators of large-scale conspiracies.
In the 1950-60s, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) attempted the
first option; it had little success with this operation, having
backfired on the US, as the operation was perceived by American allies
as having undermined the faith in the US. This may have inadvertently
contributed to false intelligence assessments both within the US and in
allied nations.42 However, humours forms of countering disinformation
through memes, that directly addresses Russian disinformation has been
successful. The invasion of Ukraine has seen widespread use of memes
intended to challenge Russian disinformation. These memes have seen
great success in undermining the effectiveness and reach of Russian
disinformation operations. The cost effectiveness of this meme tactic
makes it ideal for nations with small military budgets to adopt as a
form of retaliation.43 The second option involved the use of attacking
the major sources of disinformation by identifying its country of origin
and sites that host it. Many disinformation websites propagate old
articles and/or participate in disinformation networks, such as botnets
which automatically promote false articles. These article are often
copied or slightly modified from original creator that is at the center
of the bot net and is the human actor44 By identifying the first website
to post articles containing disinformation, one can trace the origin of
the disinformation and, in turn, target the websites, their financial
links, and where they are based.45 Over time and through the use of
shared intelligence networks, the process can be automated effectively.
This would not censor the disinformation directly, as it targets the
source of the disinformation.46 This would not prevent or limit the
spread of user-generated content either.

The Canadian government has already acknowledged two competing schools
of thought that favour domestic and international responses, the issues
comes when these are mechanized on the domestic level. Broadly, under
domestic modes of control or international initiatives. However, [there
exists a third path that employs the mechanisms of domestic modes of
control in a manner that does not harm free speech. This option affords
government the ability to monitor a particular population through
existing frameworks, and using algorithms coupled with data contributed
by allied nations that identified disinformation.]{.underline} Bill
C-ll, [which forces social media companies to provide data analyses for

### Canada CP -- Solves Liberal International Order

#### Canada can reinforce democratic liberal world order

[Heightened tensions with China, however, may push the Canadian
government to redirect some of its budget priorities toward increased
contributions to its military forces and greater financial assistance to
strengthen NATO.]{.underline} As one of the founding members of NATO,
Canada might also need to intervene to reduce internal contradictions
within the union. The Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, and Turkey
appear to have developed strong ties with China, thus diminishing the
chances of offering the US unwa- vering support should military
conflicts escalate (Mounk, 2021).

Canada could challenge China\'s assertive efforts in Southeast Asia
through providing aid to regional development through the Asian
Development Bank or Asian Infrastruc- ture Investment Bank (AIIB) or by
engaging in efforts toward the diversification of global supply chains.
These efforts would not involve an open confrontation with China, but
they could help the states in the Indo-Pacific region to be more
resilient in the face of China\'s more assertive actions toward Taiwan
in the South China and East China seas.

[Canada could also play its role in reinforcing the ILO by shifting the
\"democratic club\" countries\' priorities toward cooperative actions
around the issues of the environment, climate change, public health,
trade liberalization and peacekeeping operations]{.underline}. For
example, [Canada can do its part for international climate change
policies by setting a good example for other heavy carbon polluting
countries]{.underline} such as the US, China and Aus- tralia to commit
to concrete measures in reducing reliance on fossil fuels and providing
financing for developing countries - the countries most vulnerable to
the effects of climate change. After the US rejoined the Paris
Agreement, China expressed its willing- ness to work together on climate
issues. However, the current shortage of energy sources in China,
geopolitical and trade-related tensions with the US, and prioritizing
economic growth amidst the global pandemic might stall progress on
cutting green- house gas emissions.

[The issues of global concern will not be solved without the meaningful
involvement of countries with illiberal political regimes, which
warrants scholars\' and international policy- makers\' engagement with
the question of what the current priorities of the LIO are and how
critical the democratic components of it are for the stable future of
the world.]{.underline}

[Strengthen democratic resilience within NATO.]{.underline}

[Threats to transatlantic security come from outside the Alliance, but
also from within. Disinformation thrives in weakened democracies where
polarization, corruption, weak independent media, and low social
cohesion and trust invite foreign authoritarian influence. Just as NATO
played a key role in the 1990s and early 2000s in getting Central and
Eastern European countries on a stable democratic course, Article
2---which calls for strengthening democratic institutions---should be
brought back to the forefront of political deliberations within the
Alliance.]{.underline}

[NATO's continued support and cooperation with free and independent
media is essential to strengthening resilience. Secretary General
Stoltenberg has stated that "the best response to disinformation and
propaganda is the free and independent press\...when they ask difficult
questions, then disinformation and propaganda will never
succeed]{.underline}."89 [NATO should therefore encourage journalist
exchanges, facilitate media access to activities and exercises, and urge
member states to invest in a more robust independent local media
presence.]{.underline}

The new Strategic Concept offers an opportunity to establish more
baseline consensus on resilience. T[he Secretary General has often
appealed to the values on which the Alliance was founded and should
continue to]{.underline} use the [clout]{.underline} of his position [to
advance the conversation inside the North Atlantic Council on how
democratic resilience contributes to Allied security.]{.underline}90 The
2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué highlights the importance of the fight
against corruption and good governance for fulfilling the Alliance's
mission. A monitoring mechanism inside the Alliance or even sanctioning
members91 will not meet consensus. The Secretary General should work
discreetly behind closed doors with member states when gaps are
identified. [Adopting a code of conduct (as per the recommendations of
the NATO 2030 Reflection Group) and working with the EU on a system of
incentives and disincentives would also enhance security and trust and
consolidate political support]{.underline}.92 [NATO is ultimately a
community of norms and derives its resilience to disinformation and
influence operations from the political cohesion of its
members.]{.underline}

## Domestic Action CP

#### The USFG should invest in solutions that shore up trust domestically

[Mass-targeted covert influence operations and disinformation campaigns
are real.]{.underline} Analysis from studies show that they promote
narratives that aim to provoke outrage, capitalize on social cleavages
and, in some cases, push narratives in the interest of certain
countries. [However, evidence of activity is not evidence of impact. To
be sure, we should be aware of such operations, bringing them to light
and, when appropriate, removing them. However, if the free flow of
ideas, freedom of expression and a better quality of democratic
participation are the ultimate goals, relying on detection and deletion
is not enough,]{.underline} and, as outlined above, [the exaggeration of
the threat of foreign influence operations may do more harm than good.
**Instead, we should invest in solutions that shore up trust and
increase political participation, civil discourse and
pluralism.**]{.underline}

**[As a first step, the US Foreign Agents Registration Act, which risks
being abused for political reasons, should be reformed]{.underline}**,
as Nick Robinson argues in Foreign Policy. [Second, increasing
transparency around campaign funding and online ad spending would also
be helpful, specifically around "dark money" --- where the identities of
the donors are concealed. And lastly, states need to do the hard work of
governance. **In many ways the prevalence of false and misleading
content is symptomatic of deeper issues**]{.underline}. As Johan Farkas
and Jannick Schou demonstrate in their book, Post-Truth, Fake News and
Democracy, [the decline in democracy has been ongoing for decades and is
not because of social media: "There is a series of deep-seated problems
facing liberal democracies, but the rise of fake news and alternative
facts is not the biggest of our problems." **Instead of looking overseas
for scapegoats, we should be looking at why trust in our own
institutions and authorities has fallen, why civil discourse has
devolved and how to better address the many social divisions that drive
our receptivity for dubious content.**]{.underline}

#### To combat disinformation NATO should propose a standard of classes that teach media literacy. This solves all of aff's impacts and stops political apathy

[Ukraine itself is doing a remarkable job of presenting its story to the
world. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy]{.underline} is ubiquitous. Whether
he is walking through Kyiv or addressing the United Nations, Zelenskyy
forcefully calls upon the world to assist his country. He [has become a
media superstar, admired as the Ukrainian David standing up to the
Russian Goliath. Besides Zelenskyy, Ukrainian officials and individual
citizens flood social media with words and images about their resistance
to the invader. This content is often heartbreaking, as it vividly
illustrates the human costs of war, but for now it keeps Ukraine at the
forefront of debate about the geopolitical future.]{.underline}

[In response, the Kremlin relies on connecting with presumably
sympathetic Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine and
elsewhere.]{.underline} It also broadcasts anti-American messaging about
Ukraine to parts of the world where suspicion of the United States runs
high. [But in the contest for Western public opinion, Russia is finding
itself overmatched.]{.underline}

Nevertheless, as war drags on, terrain changes. [Vladimir Putin will try
to outlast his opponents, knowing that the public's attention span is
notoriously short, no matter how horrific daily news reports might be.
Zelenskyy and his compatriots must continue to counterpunch fiercely
with information as well as conventional military measures.]{.underline}

**[Beyond Ukraine, information warfare will be a significant factor in
future conflicts]{.underline}**. Among lessons learned from this war
should be that an unprepared public is dangerously susceptible to
disinformation. Manipulated communication expands during conflict. I[n
response, global publics will need to embrace media literacy, which
fosters healthy skepticism as people weigh the information they receive.
This means adding media literacy training across education systems'
curricula. **Some nations, notably Finland, are already doing this, but
most countries lag far behind.**]{.underline}

[The classroom may seem a long way from the battleground of Ukraine, but
understanding and mastering the use of information at war is a complex
task.]{.underline} Vladimir Putin is painfully learning that.
