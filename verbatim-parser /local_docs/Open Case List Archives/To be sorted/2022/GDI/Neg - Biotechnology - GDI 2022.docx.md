### No biotech theft

#### Lab security is thorough and effective 

**Chamlee '17**, Interviewing Damon, 17 Virginia Chamlee, interviewing
Inger K. Damon, MD, PhD, the director of the CDC\'s Division of
High-Consequence Pathogens and Pathology, incident commander for the CDC
Ebola Response. \[This Is What It's Like to Work with The World\'s
Deadliest Pathogens Every Day, 6-19-2017,

[[Entering a]{.underline}]{.mark} BSL-4 [[lab requires]{.mark} typing in
[a unique key code]{.mark}, undergoing [an iris scan, and removing
all]{.mark} personal [clothing]{.mark}]{.underline}, jewelry, [and
accessories]{.underline} (with the exception of eyeglasses). Next,
workers don clothing for the lab: a scrub suit, socks, and inner gloves.
Then comes the \"spacesuit" --- i.e., a full-body, positive-pressure
biosafety suit, which Damon said "pushes air out to prevent anything
from coming in." A 2007 photo of the BSL-4 lab &quot;spacesuits.&quot;
The suits the scientists currently wear are white instead of orange, and
have white boots and black gloves. CDC / Via phil.cdc.gov A 2007 photo
of the BSL-4 lab \"spacesuits.\" The suits the scientists currently wear
are white instead of orange, and have white boots and black gloves. The
suit is so large it adds a solid two to three inches to anyone's height,
thereby restricting movement and making laboratory work even more
difficult than it is already. With no air coming in, it also creates a
dehydrating environment --- which is not necessarily a bad thing,
considering how difficult it would be to take a bathroom break. The
lab's security features read like something from Mission: Impossible,
specially engineered to prevent microorganisms from being disseminated
into the environment. [[The walls are made of]{.mark} thick, [solid
concrete]{.mark}, designed to maintain pressure differentials and
withstand natural disasters. In essence, [they form a **sealed internal
shell**]{.mark} --- "to facilitate fumigation and prohibit animal and
insect intrusion," according to the CDC]{.underline}. [[Floors
are]{.mark} designed with a [watertight]{.mark} seal. Laboratory
furniture is simple, void of sharp corners, and covered in a nonporous
material to allow for easy decontamination. [Windows]{.mark} (if there
are any) [are shatter-resistant]{.mark} and sealed. Eating, drinking,
smoking,]{.underline} [handling]{.underline} contact [lenses, applying
cosmetics, and storing food for human consumption is, perhaps
unsurprisingly, entirely off-limits. [No phones are allowed
inside]{.mark} the lab]{.underline}, but there is a computer from which
scientists can access emails and files (though they'd have to do so
wearing gloves that make typing a challenge). With the exception of the
scientists themselves, who enter and exit the lab each day, **[[nothing
can get out]{.underline}]{.mark}**. With no air coming in, it also
creates a dehydrating environment --- which is not necessarily a bad
thing, considering how difficult it would be to take a bathroom break.
"[[Any way the virus could potentially escape, there are]{.mark} at
least two [ways to prevent that]{.mark} from happening]{.underline},"
Damon told BuzzFeed. ["The [samples are]{.mark} kept in biosafety
cabinets, there's negative pressure in the room, doors are
**[airtight]{.mark}** and gasketed. There are multiple ways that, when
air is coming out of the lab, it's then purified and cleaned. And any
waste products generated in the lab are autoclaved]{.underline} \[i.e.,
placed into a pressure chamber to sterilize medical waste\] [and
incinerated]{.underline}." Upon leaving the lab, [workers step into a
decontamination chamber]{.underline}, which showers a mix of chemicals
over their suits to decontaminate anything that may be on the surface.
From the chemical shower, they go through an inner changing room, where
they take off the suit and everything worn beneath it. The clothing worn
in the lab under the spacesuit is treated as a potentially contaminated
material, and thoroughly decontaminated before being laundered. Next,
lab workers must take a personal shower before entering an outer
changing area, where they can then dress into street clothes.

### Biotech not key to weapons

#### Biotech won't be used for weapons or terrorism

Atomic Scientists, "*BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS IN THE 'SHADOW WAR'*"

Accessed 6/25/22, TR)]{.underline}

[[The **threat** of terrorists using biological agents exists but is
**very limited**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The fear of nonstate actors using
biological agents rose with Aum Shinrikyo's 1995 failed efforts to
spread botulinum and anthrax in Japan[. [Fears]{.mark} of bioterror
[reached]{.mark} its most recent [crescendo with]{.mark} the 2001
[anthrax]{.mark} letter mailings, coming as they did within weeks after
the 9/11 attacks. [The threat of]{.mark} further [bioterror attacks,
however, **never materialized**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Despite the fact that terrorist biological weapons attacks have not
materialized since the Amerithrax scare, [[some]{.mark} continue to
[argue that the supposed ease and lower cost]{.mark} of biological
weapons development, production, and use along with the societal
disruption of COVID-19 has [incentivized bad actors]{.mark} to adopt
biological weapons]{.underline}. These concerns have been echoed by
others who assume that misuse is inevitable and following the COVID-19
example will result in mass casualties and crippling political,
societal, and economic repercussions.

[[However, the]{.mark} bioterror threat [seems to have
**diminished**]{.mark} --- not grown --- since the 2001 Amerithrax
letter mailings]{.underline}. The core al-Qaeda biological weapons
efforts were first envisioned in the late 1990s and began in earnest
shortly afterward. [Yet the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the fall of
the Taliban in late 2001 effectively disrupted al-Qaeda's biological
weapons work which largely centered on anthrax.]{.underline} Left
without a suitable safe haven, [al-Qaeda was never able to reconstitute
its biological weapons efforts.]{.underline} The Taliban's return to
power in Afghanistan, however, may result in a reemergence of al-Qaeda
and its biological weapons ambitions. Time will tell whether the Taliban
now will grant safe haven to al-Qaeda that could be used for biological
weapons work. What is undoubted is that the Taliban and al-Qaeda have a
shared history and have continued to work closely together. Without a
presence in Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence will have a more difficult
time detecting any resurgent al-Qaeda biological weapons efforts.

[The threat of a biological weapons effort by the Islamic State in Iraq
**never materialized**]{.underline}, although the group did manage to
produce and use chemical weapons agents until that program was
effectively disrupted. Other terrorist groups' interest in biological
weapons has been rudimentary with a focus predominately on toxins such
as ricin and botulinum. U.S. domestic extremists, self-radicalized
individuals, and lone actors also have gravitated toward ricin, but no
known casualties have resulted from the decades-long interest in ricin.

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} analysts, however[, [argue that]{.mark} the
[life science]{.mark} revolution and global proliferation of related
scientific and technical capabilities has [opened a Pandora's Box of
biothreats]{.mark}]{.underline}. The argument goes that the rapid
revolution in genetic engineering --- including synthetic biology ---
the DIY bio movement, and the advent of technologies like CRISPR
(acronym for "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats") makes their misuse likely. However, as noted in the 2018
National Academies of Science report, Biodefense in the Age of Synthetic
Biology[, the large-scale [production and delivery]{.mark} of biological
weapons agents [is **inherently difficult**]{.mark}, with biological
weapons use favoring small-scale, highly targeted attacks.]{.underline}

### Bioterror defense

#### Biotech doesn't risk bioterrorism -- overstated capacity, only states can do it

(Accessed 6-27-22)-AO

In relation to existing top-down governance measures for biosecurity,
synthetic biology represents a promising yet potentially destabilizing
advancement in the life sciences, one that could introduce new risks and
regulatory challenges. In particular, a number of high-profle synthetic
biology experiments, ranging from the de novo synthesis of poliovirus
(Cello et al. 2002) to the recent synthesis of horsepox virus (Noyce
et al. 2018), have raised concerns that the same techniques could be
exploited to bypass regulatory controls (e.g. the United States, US,
Select Agent Regulations) on lists of high-risk pathogens. Moreover, the
possibility of synthesizing novel 'taxonomically unclassifed' pathogens
(NSABB 2006; Garfnkel et al. 2007) has led some to question the logic
and utility of current 'list-based' approaches to regulation. Looking to
the future, if synthetic biology does, in fact, 'deskill' the 'art' of
biological engineering, new regulatory approaches could very well be
essential because [the tools of [modern biology will be]{.mark} widely
[accessible to]{.mark} both responsible and [malicious actors.
Claims]{.mark} about synthetic biology's potential, like other emerging
technologies, [nonetheless]{.mark} tend to **[overstate its 'enabling'
capacity]{.mark}**. Likewise, **[the ease of producing biological
weapons tends to be overstated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a number of
commentators note, biology is not yet easy to engineer (Jefferson et al.
2014) and, for the foreseeable future, [[the skills necessary]{.mark} to
produce biological weapons [are likely to remain only within the grasp
of states]{.mark}]{.underline} (Piers Millet in Regalado 2016). However,
the feld's emphasis on eliminating technical barriers and reducing the
importance of tacit knowledge (Oye 2012) represents a powerful source of
expectation for advocates and critics alike. For advocates, it
represents the possible realization of modern biology's full potential,
one that could yield revolutionary advances in health, medicine, and
industry in the twenty-frst century. [[For critics, it represents a
seemingly openended risk that requires **exceptional
precaution**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For national governments, and
international conventions responsible for establishing global
biosecurity norms and obligations that are operationalized at the
national level  through legislation and other regulatory tools (McLeish
and Nightingale 2007), a central question is how (if at all)
does top-down biosecurity governance need to change in response to
synthetic biology?

#### Non-State actors fail to develop biological weapons

[‌Some policymakers and [analysts have expressed concern that]{.mark}
weaknesses in responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic will motivate [terrorists]{.mark} to [seek bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons. However]{.mark}]{.underline}, an examination of the Islamic
State (IS) and al-Qaeda narratives about the pandemic reveals [**[no
causal relationship]{.mark}** between the pandemic and any heightened
interest in biological weapons]{.underline}. A review of [[the
historical pursuit]{.mark} of biological weapons by the IS and by
al-Qaeda [reveals]{.mark} that both [groups]{.mark} evinced some
interest, but [ultimately]{.mark} each [employed conventional]{.mark}
forms of [attack]{.mark} instead.]{.underline} Despite limited IS use of
chemical agents that challenged the taboo against the use of poison as a
weapon, [[there are **formidable hurdles** that nonstate actors must
clear to develop, produce, and use biological agents as
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although [[the prospect]{.mark} of the IS and al-Qaeda pursuing
biological weapons is not zero, it [is unlikely]{.mark}, [given]{.mark}
both the difficulties and the much [easier]{.mark} and readily available
[**alternatives** that meet their]{.mark} deadly
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the wake of the pandemic, several
measures can enhance capabilities to address both public health and
military challenges. These [[**measures** reduce the possibility]{.mark}
of and improve the response to a future naturally occurring pandemic
while also helping to deter, prevent, and respond to any possible
terrorist acquisition and use of biological weapons]{.underline}.
Focusing unduly on the potential, but unlikely[, terrorist use of
biological materials as weapons skews resources to unique military and
counterterrorism measures and away from measures that are useful in both
events. In the post-pandemic period, governments need to rebalance their
efforts.]{.underline}

Key Findings

Looking at both the historical baselines and the pandemic-era narratives
of the [IS and al-Qaeda, neither group seems likely to use biological
materials in future attacks as a consequence of the global COVID-19
pandemic]{.underline}

[[It is unlikely that an actor]{.mark} with only modest knowledge [can
access the necessary materials and fashion a]{.mark} biological
[weapon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The prospects of an individual or a group successfully accomplishing all
the necessary steps are not zero, but given the difficulty involved in
developing such weapons and the fact that conventional weapon
alternatives are readily available, nonstate actors have routinely
chosen other means of attack.

Even such terrorist groups as the IS and al-Qaeda, which have not
hesitated to commit terrible acts of violence, have not demonstrated a
concerted effort to develop biological weapons, and their chemical
weapon activities have thus far been much less deadly than their
conventional weapon attacks.

COVID-19 and the effects of global climate change are stern prompts to
reimagine threats to national and international security

Prioritizing threats is a difficult task, particularly when threats are
novel.

Although individuals and reports issued warnings about the possibility
of a pandemic, other near-term or long-feared postulated threats took
precedent.

[Slow-moving and naturally occurring events rarely get the same
attention as hostile states or terrorist groups, and feared "bolt from
the blue" attacks from states or terrorists have tended to dominate the
thinking of political leaders and national security
experts.]{.underline}

## China neg

### China not rising fast enough

#### U.S. already has the biotech edge, not falling behind in terms of competitiveness

Scott **Moore '21**, February 17, a lecturer in political science at the
University of Pennsylvania and previously served at the U.S. Department
of State, where he worked on the Paris Agreement, "In Biotech, the
Industry of the Future, the U.S. Is Way Ahead of China," LAWFARE,
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-024-2086-9.pdf

It was supposed to be China's moment of technological triumph---one that
would show the world Beijing had not only conquered the coronavirus but
also emerged as a biotechnology superpower. But when clinical data on
China's flagship CoronaVac vaccine finally flowed in, they showed it was
barely more than 50 percent effective---just clearing the minimum
standard set by the World Health Organization. In contrast, not one but
two vaccines developed by U.S. firms have been found to be upward of 95
percent effective, a standard no other country's vaccines have yet met
in rigorous clinical trials. The [United States's]{.underline} overall
track record in responding to the pandemic has been awful. Yet the
[success of its vaccine development efforts shows that [when it comes to
biotechnology]{.mark}, the industry of the future, the [**U.S. is way
ahead** of China and]{.mark} most of its [other
rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[A continuing refrain from Washington in recent years has been that the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} falling
[behind]{.mark} China in the development of critical emerging
technologies. **[In some fields]{.mark}**, this may be true. **[But
not]{.mark} in [biotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}. To be sure,
[China's biotech sector is growing at a torrid pace]{.underline}, and
some of its firms are becoming leaders in certain areas, such as cancer
treatment. [Yet [the U.S. retains a dominant position in research,
development and commercialization, accounting for]{.mark} almost **[half
of all biotech patents]{.mark} filed from 1999 to 2013**. The [triumph
of its]{.mark} biotechnology industry during the [corona]{.mark}virus
pandemic, producing two highly effective [vaccines]{.mark} using an
entirely new approach based on messenger RNA, and in record time, [shows
that the U.S.'s competitive edge in biotechnology remains]{.mark}
largely [intact]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[that has]{.mark} important
[implications]{.mark}]{.underline} as Washington gears up
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} a sustained period of [[geopolitical
competition]{.underline}]{.mark} with Beijing.

### China coop not conflict

#### Biotechnology will produce US-China cooperation, not conflict

**Moore and Coplin '22**, April 8. Scott Moore is Director of China
Programs and Strategic Initiatives and Lecturer in Political Science at
the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches Chinese politics,
Abigail Coplin is an Assistant Professor of Sociology and Science,
Technology, and Society at Vassar College. Her research analyzes the
development of China's biotechnology and agrobiotechnology. "Closing the
U.S. to Chinese Biotech Would Do Far More Harm Than Good," CHINA FILE,
<https://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/closing-us-chinese-biotech-would-do-far-more-harm-good>;
Analina

Yet at the same time, [[Washington and Beijing have good reasons to
see]{.mark} certain areas of [biotech]{.mark}nology [as grounds for
**cooperation rather than conflict or
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [most [advanced]{.mark} areas of
[biotech]{.mark}nology, like gene editing and synthetic biology, [are
double-edged swords]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They show great promise to
help cure chronic diseases and develop drought-resistant crops, but also
to create dangerous new viruses, human genetic modifications, and even
genetically-engineered terrorism.]{.underline} [The [risks and
threats]{.mark} posed by these emerging biotechnologies [cannot be
confined to any one country]{.mark}.]{.underline} Potentially [dangerous
biotechnology research can be undertaken virtually anywhere, meaning
that [all countries need to develop]{.mark} and enforce [rules]{.mark}
preventing research that could create new viruses or bioweapons, for
example. [China is an especially important player in international
biosafety and biosecurity]{.mark}, and the country's 2020 legislation on
both topics is, on paper at least, among the most stringent in the
world.]{.underline} Gene therapy trials based on somatic editing are
underway in both the U.S. and China, and as researchers in both
countries begin to tinker with the fundamental building blocks of life,
engagement on the use of these groundbreaking, but potentially
dangerous, technologies is needed both to ensure transparency as well as
to begin the difficult process of establishing mutually-agreed rules and
norms.

### China hegemony defense

#### Chinese hegemony has structural limitations

Andrew **Nathan \'22**, March/April, Class of 1919 Professor of
Political Science at Columbia University, \"A Rival of America's Making?
The Debate Over Washington's China Strategy,\" FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-11/china-strategy-rival-americas-making

[The country's geographic position is also unfavorable. Along its land
and sea borders, [China confronts distrustful neighbors]{.mark}. Among
them are seven of the 15 most populous countries in the
world]{.underline} (India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, the Philippines,
Russia, and Vietnam) and five countries with which China has fought wars
within the past 80 years (India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and
Vietnam). [[None]{.mark} of China's neighbors [is culturally]{.mark}
Chinese [or ideologically aligned with the Chinese]{.mark} Communist
Party]{.underline}. All may cooperate with China at various times and to
varying degrees for strategic or economic reasons, but [[all seek to
**hedge against** Chinese domination]{.underline}]{.mark}, [often by
cultivating relations with the United States. As Chinese behavior has
become more assertive, this [counterbalancing]{.mark} behavior [is
growing more evident]{.mark}. India has compromised its traditional
strategic autonomy in order to participate in joint military exercises
with Australia, Japan, and the United States as part of the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, known as the Quad. Japan has taken the
unprecedented step of officially declaring stability in the Taiwan
Strait to be a national interest. And Australia has reaffirmed its U.S.
alliance by accepting help in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines under
the 2021 AUKUS agreement. [China is unlikely to achieve]{.mark} anything
like [hegemony]{.mark} over any but the smallest of its
neighbors.]{.underline}

Geography helps explain another Chinese weakness: its lack of allies
other than North Korea. There are [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} that
are nearby enough to receive substantial help from China in the case of
a military conflict, but they all [[fear China more than they fear any
other state]{.underline}]{.mark}. The lack of allies is more a liability
than an asset, for it deprives China of ways to multiply the pressure it
can put on uncooperative neighbors and of the ability to position
sizable military forces around the world. To be sure, none of the United
States' 60-some allies and partners has interests identical to
Washington's. None can be counted on to follow every component of U.S.
strategy toward China. [But U.S. alliances and partnerships still
complicate China's military calculations, increase the pressure on
Beijing to comply with the international norms preferred by other
states, and expand the alternatives available to countries considering
whether to accept Chinese investments]{.underline}.

[[Nor is the structural distribution of international power favorable to
Chinese global dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Barring catastrophic
mismanagement by other states, [[China will continue to face]{.mark}
five [powerful rivals]{.mark}---India, Japan, Russia, the United States,
and the European Union---[in a multipolar system that is not going to
disappear. A unipolar moment]{.mark}, if one ever really existed,
**[cannot be re-created]{.mark}**, not by the United States and
certainly not [by China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### China war defense

#### War with China won't go nuclear

Andrew **Nathan \'22**, March/April, Class of 1919 Professor of
Political Science at Columbia University, \"A Rival of America's Making?
The Debate Over Washington's China Strategy,\" FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-11/china-strategy-rival-americas-making

THREAT PERCEPTION

[[The challenge the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [faces from
China is bad enough without exaggerating]{.mark} it]{.underline}. As
realism would predict, Beijing is dissatisfied with the status quo: it
is closely hemmed in by Washington's allies, partners, and military
forces; its supply lines are vulnerable to U.S. interdiction; and its
society is influenced by American culture. [China wants to push the
United States away from its shores and weaken its alliances, and this
means a real chance of [conflict]{.mark}, especially over Taiwan. I
agree with Mearsheimer that if such a war occurred, it **[would probably
be a limited war]{.mark}**,]{.underline} albeit highly destructive and
tragic. I also agree that it would have the
potential---**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** a great one, but more than
zero---to escalate to [[a nuclear exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[But [Mearsheimer is wrong to describe China's determination]{.mark} to
gain control over Taiwan [as]{.mark} either "[emotional" or
"expansionist]{.mark}]{.underline}," because these descriptors make
China sound irrationally aggressive. Mearsheimer's own theory of
[realism better explains why Beijing will not lose its appetite for
Taiwan, given the long-standing legal basis of its sovereignty claim and
the island's strategic, economic, and technological importance to
Chinese security]{.underline}. Also consistent with realism is China's
preference for avoiding a premature strike on Taiwan and instead
deterring Taiwanese independence as long as it takes to achieve what
Beijing calls "peaceful reunification." But deterring Taiwanese
independence has meant that China has had to build up military assets
capable of threatening the aircraft carriers and forward air and naval
bases that the United States has long relied on to stave off any attempt
to take Taiwan by force. The result: a U.S.-Chinese arms race that
raises the risk of war through miscalculation.

And Mearsheimer is wrong to describe Beijing's goal as global dominance.
In a multipolar world, China will seek to shape global institutions to
its advantage, just as major powers have always done. But it has no
proposal for an alternative, Beijing-dominated set of institutions. It
remains strongly committed to the global free-trade regime, as well as
to the UN and that organization's alphabet soup of agencies. It
participates actively in the UN human rights system in order to help its
allies and frustrate its rivals. Its Belt and Road Initiative operates
alongside, rather than in place of, long-standing Western-funded
development programs. [[China seeks influence]{.mark}, but it has little
prospect of dominance as long as other powers also stay active in these
institutions]{.underline}.

[Overestimating the China threat is just as dangerous as underestimating
it]{.underline}. [**[Hyping the hazard]{.mark}** makes it harder to
manage, by creating panic among both the American public and Chinese
policymakers. Whether or not engagement [was the mistake]{.mark} that
Mearsheimer claims, whether or not there was ever an option to constrain
China's growth as he believes, we are where we are]{.underline}. I agree
with Mearsheimer that what the United States must do now is manage the
situation---which should mean not exacerbating what is already, on cold
realist grounds, a serious challenge.

### Econ defense

#### Economic collapse doesn't cause war 

Daniel **Drezner '14**, January, professor of International Law at
Tufts, The System Worked: Global Economic Governance during the Great
Recession, World Politics, Volume 66. Number 1, online

The final significant outcome addresses [a dog that hasn\'t barked: the
effect of the Great Recession on cross-border conflict and violence.
During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple [analysts asserted
that]{.mark} the [financial crisis would lead states to increase their
use of force]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a tool for staying in
power]{.underline}.42 [[They voiced]{.mark} genuine [concern
that]{.mark} the **global [economic downturn]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}
lead to an [increase]{.mark} in conflict---whether through greater
internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a
[ratcheting]{.mark} up of great power conflict]{.underline}. Violence in
the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and even the
disruptions of the Occupy movement fueled impressions of a surge in
global public disorder.

[**The [aggregate data suggest otherwise]{.mark}**, however. The
Institute for Economics and Peace has concluded that \"[the average
level of peacefulness]{.mark} in 2012 [is approximately the same]{.mark}
as it was in 2007.\"43 [Interstate violence]{.mark} in particular has
[**declined** since the start of the financial crisis, as have military
expenditures]{.mark} in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm
that]{.underline} [[the Great Recession has not triggered]{.mark} any
increase in [violent conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Lotta Themner and
Peter Wallensteen conclude: [\"\[[T\]he pattern is one of relative
stability]{.mark} when we consider the trend for the past five
years]{.underline}.\"44 [The]{.underline} secular [decline in violence
that started with the end of the Cold War has not been
reversed]{.underline}. Rogers Brubaker observes that \"[the crisis has
not]{.underline} to date [generated the surge in protectionist
nationalism or ethnic exclusion that might have been
expected]{.underline}.\"45

#### No diversionary war.

Political Scandals? Cross-National Experiments on Diversionary Action in

[**[The diversionary theory of war]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} one of the
[best-known]{.mark} conflict initiation theories focusing on democratic
leaders' incentives. According to the theory]{.underline}, democratic
[leaders]{.underline} who face greater electoral challenges, either
[[due to]{.mark} political scandals or an **[economic
downturn]{.mark}**]{.underline}, are more likely to [choose provocative
foreign policies and seek to lead the country into diplomatic crises, in
hopes of inciting nationalistic sentiments]{.underline} that will boost
their approval ratings via the so-called "rally around the flag" effect
(e.g. Gaines 2002; Hetherington and Nelson 2003; Mueller 1973).

[**[Despite]{.mark} the [intuitive appeal]{.mark}** of this
theory,]{.underline} [[**empirical studies** have been largely unable to
find consistent evidence]{.mark} to corroborate the purported
theoretical mechanisms]{.underline}. Findings from observational studies
have been quite mixed. The fact that a [diverse]{.underline} set of
[findings]{.underline} have been reported from observational studies
[suggests that [**unobservable confounders** arising from strategic
interactions greatly hinder our ability to tease out the causal
effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of electoral hardship on conflict behaviors.

[In this research note, we claim that [the key assumption of the theory
does not work]{.mark} as expected. That is, [a]{.mark} political [leader
cannot divert attention]{.mark}]{.underline} from his/her political
scandals [[by]{.mark} [emphasizing a foreign threat]{.mark} and alerting
the general public that the country may go to war against an enemy.
Although [the assumptions]{.mark} that the threat or use of force is
salient and that an acute enemy threat would create a
rally-around-the-flag effect are common, they [have rarely been
tested]{.mark} at a micro-level in an experimental setting. Our team
conducted a cross-national experiment to find out whether and how
political leaders could divert the public's attention away from their
political scandals]{.underline}.

### Nuclear war defense

#### Conflicts won't go nuclear -- use-it-or-lose-it is a fallacy

**Kroenig**, Mathew, Professor in the department of government at
Georgetown, **Winter 2021** ("Will Emerging Technology Cause Nuclear
War?: Bringing Geopolitics Back In", Air University, Winter, 2021,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-4/D-Kroenig.pdf>,
accessed 6/27/22, ,FLC)

There are several limitations, however, to the existing analysis. First,
the underlying theory of nuclear conflict this body of thought advances
is debatable. [It rests heavily on the "use it or lose it" cause of
nuclear war, but use it or lose it is rooted in the logical fallacy of
the false dilemma]{.underline}.12 [States have many options in a crisis
other than suffering a disarming nuclear attack or launching
one]{.underline}. Moreover, faced with a range of choices[, the
use-it-or-lose-it logic assumes a state will intentionally choose to
initiate a nuclear war---the most risky and costly available
option.]{.underline} [The use-it-or-lose-it pathway to nuclear war,
therefore, is in tension with mainstream nuclear deterrence theory that
maintains states will be reluctant to conduct a deliberate attack on
another nuclear-armed state.13]{.underline}

A second limitation of this approach is that theories of nuclear
instability developed in the early days of the Cold War are in tension
with current understandings of the causes of war in contemporary
international relations theory. The nuclear stability framework rests on
the notion that parity in the balance of power is associated with peace.
[The prevailing bargaining model of war, however, maintains that parity
contributes to uncertainty about the balances of power and resolve,
which hinders efforts to reach negotiated settlements short of armed
conflict.]{.underline}14 [The empirical record supports this theory and
demonstrates parity in the balance of power is associated with conflict,
and uneven balances of power are associated with peace]{.underline}.15
Situations of obvious strategic nuclear superiority, therefore, may be
more stable than situations of strategic parity.

## Democracy NEG

### Democracy doesn't solve stuff

#### Democracy is overrated -- accountability is not proven nor is solvency for war

Daniel **Larison '12**, PhD in history from the University of Chicago,
"Democratic Peace Theory Is False," THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE,
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/democratic-peace-theory-is-false/

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.
Regardless, [[democratic peace theory draws **broad conclusions** from a
short period in modern history with very few cases]{.mark} before the
20th century. [The core]{.mark} of democratic peace
[theory]{.mark}]{.underline} as I understand it [[is that democratic
governments are **more accountable**]{.mark} **to their
populations**]{.underline}, [and because the people will bear the costs
of the war [they are]{.mark} going to be [less willing to support a
war]{.mark} policy. This supposedly keeps democratic states from waging
wars against one another [because of]{.mark} the built-in electoral and
[institutional checks]{.mark} on government power]{.underline}. One
small problem with [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it [[is
**rubbish**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[**[Democracies in antiquity fought against one another]{.mark}**.
Political [equality and voting do not abolish **conflicts of
interest**]{.mark} **between competing states**. [Democratic peace
theory doesn't account for]{.mark} the effects of **[nationalist and
imperialist ideologies]{.mark}** on the way democratic nations think
about war. [Democratic nations]{.mark} that [have]{.mark} professional
[armies]{.mark} to do the fighting for them are [often enthusiastic
about]{.mark} overseas [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Conservative-Unionist government that waged the South African War
(against two states with elected governments, I might add) enjoyed great
popular support and won a huge majority in the "Khaki" election that
followed.

As long as it goes well and doesn't have too many costs, [war can be
quite popular, and [even if the war is costly it may still be
popular]{.mark} if it is fought for nationalist reasons that appeal to a
majority of the public]{.underline}. If the public is whipped into
thinking that there is an intolerable foreign threat or if they believe
that their country can gain something at relatively low cost by going to
war, the type of government they have really is irrelevant. Unless a
democratic public believes that a military conflict will go badly for
their military, they may be ready to welcome the outbreak of a war that
they expect to win. [Setting aside the flaws and failures of U.S.-led
democracy promotion for a moment, **[the idea that reducing the number
of non-democracies makes war less likely is just fantasy]{.mark}**.
Clashing interests between states aren't going away, and the more
democratic states there are in the world the more likely it is that two
or more of them will eventually fight one another.]{.underline}

#### Best research shows democracy doesn't produce peace

Jeff **Grabmeier '15**. Senior Director, Research communications, Media
& PR "'Democratic peace\' may not prevent international conflict,"
https://phys.org/news/2015-09-democratic-peace-international-conflict.html

[[Using a new technique to analyze 52 years of international conflict,
researchers suggest that there may be **no such thing as a \"democratic
peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

In addition, [[a model developed with this]{.mark} new [technique was
found to predict international conflict]{.mark} five and even ten years
in the future **[better than any existing model]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Democratic peace is the widely held theory that democracies are less
likely to go to war against each other than countries with other types
of government]{.underline}.

[In the new study, researchers found that economic [trade relationships
and]{.mark} participation in international governmental [organizations
play a strong role in keeping]{.mark} the [peace]{.mark} among
countries. **[But democracy? Not so much]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\"**[That\'s a startling finding]{.underline}** because the value of
joint democracy in preventing war is what we thought was the closest
thing to a law in international politics,\" said Skyler Cranmer, lead
author of the study and The Carter Phillips and Sue Henry Associate
Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University.

\"[There\'s been empirical [research supporting this theory]{.mark} for
the past 50 years. Even U.S. presidents have touted the value of a
democratic peace, but it **[doesn\'t seem to hold
up]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least the way we looked at it.\"

### NATO bad

#### NATO is obsolete -- technology is not a game-changer

Simon **Jenkins '18**, June 12, Guardian columnist, "Donald Trump is
right. Nato is a costly white elephant," THE GUARDIAN,
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/12/donald-trump-nato-costly-white-elephant-russia>

I regard Trump as an aberration, a temporary trauma afflicting US
politics. He honours the thesis of the historian Arthur Schlesinger,
that America's constitution often drives the republic to the abyss, only
to drag it back again. But even monsters can ask the occasional good
question. Thus Trump this week on Nato, a body so mired in platitude and
waffle it has lost sight of its true purpose. Trump wants to know what
Europe really regards as its defence policy, for he thinks it takes
America for a ride. [[Nato was founded in 1949]{.mark} in response to
Stalin's blockade of Berlin]{.underline}. It was meant to "keep the
Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down". Since then,
it has welcomed the American nuclear shield, at vast cost to America.
Otherwise, [[its only military achievements have been the breakup of
Yugoslavia and the loss of]{.mark} a squalid 17-year war in
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Neither has anything to do with the
North Atlantic. Nothing better symbolised this than Theresa May's
bizarre gift to Trump this week of 450 British troops for Kabul.

Nato was about deterring an attack on Europe from Russia. In 1945, the
west agreed the Potsdam settlement, accepting the Soviets' "sphere of
influence" over eastern Europe. Thus when Russia invaded Hungary in 1956
and Czechoslovakia in 1968, there was no question of Nato, or Europe,
retaliating. The iron curtain was iron.

Come 1989 and the collapse of Potsdam Europe, Nato did not approach a
broken Russia to agree some new settlement. It did the opposite. To
protests from Russia's weakened leader, Boris Yeltsin, it gathered
former Warsaw Pact states under its wing and advanced its border east
towards Russia. It embraced Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, then the
Baltic states, Romania and Bulgaria. It was like Khrushchev stationing
missiles in Cuba. Only Germany counselled caution.

Nato's provocation was so blatant as to be an open invitation to any new
populist leader in Moscow to exploit Russia's bruised patriotism: hence
Vladimir Putin. He and his kleptocratic cronies are virtually a Nato
creation. But the fact that America was party to the provocation does
not invalidate Trump's question. What is Nato's policy beyond needling
Russia and feebly relying on the American shield?

It is astonishing that, three decades after 1989, Europe is almost back
to a cold war with Moscow. As winner of the last war, Nato was primarily
responsible for lowering tension and making peace. Instead it revelled
in victory. If Europe wants to hire an America nuclear shield, it should
deal with America over how to pay for it. But the current tit-for-tat
hostilities with Russia are playing with fire, and counterproductive.
[[Europe's land forces are]{.underline}]{.mark} so
[[weak]{.underline}]{.mark} they would be wiped out by Russia in a
matter of days. So is Europe really expecting Washington to order a
nuclear barrage against Russian "grey area" incursions into the Baltics,
let alone a conflict with Orbán's Hungary or Erdoğan's Turkey -- both
Nato members?

This is not realistic, any more than was American intervention during
Russia's incursion in Ukraine or Georgia. That is why Orbán and Erdoğan
are wisely cosying up to Putin. **[[Nato is adrift of
realpolitik]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Trump is effectively telling Europe that its [**[Nato is as outdated as
the Congress of Vienna]{.mark}** by the time of Bismarck. He is wrong to
rabbit on about [spending]{.mark} 2% or 4% of GDP [on weapons]{.mark}.
This [helps no one]{.mark} but the defence industries -- spending should
meet plausible threat, not some vague budget target. But [no more
helpful is Europe's belligerent posturing]{.mark} towards Moscow, such
as Britain's reaction to the mysterious Wiltshire
poisonings]{.underline}. Entrenching Putin behind a siege economy is not
a defence policy.

#### NATO doesn't fund their military enough to be useful 

Christian **Whiton '18**, July 6, Senior Fellow at the Center for the
National Interest, "NATO Is Obsolete" THE NATIONAL INTEREST,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-obsolete-25167?page=0%2C1

[After the alliance was established in 1949, its first secretary
general, Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its purpose concisely: "to keep
the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The
unofficial mission matched the time well]{.underline}: Western Europe's
postwar future was clouded by the prospect of a Soviet invasion,
American insularity, or German militarism---all possible given the
preceding decades of history.

[Nearly seventy years later, none of these concerns still
exist]{.underline}. Furthermore, NATO\'s opposing alliance during the
Cold War, the Warsaw Pact, quit the Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet
Union itself passed into history in 1991---twenty-seven years ago.

Despite endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive burden
on U.S. taxpayers, **[[NATO has failed to be of much
use]{.underline}]{.mark}** since then. As its boosters like to remind
us, after 9/11, the alliance invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense
provision on our behalf. But action from America's allies did not follow
the grandiose gesture---the NATO mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on
U.S. forces and effectively failed.

[Today, [the alliance's bureaucrats and]{.mark} some member states
spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the organization
alive]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and equip"
missions.

[Yet NATO [members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a real sense of
danger from]{.mark} Russia or [anyone]{.mark} else. Among the
twenty-nine members, only the United States is really serious about its
Article 3 obligations to defend itself, spending approximately \$700
billion or 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense. No other NATO member comes
close to this proportion, and [the vast majority fail]{.mark} even [to
meet the modest]{.mark}, self-imposed [requirement to devote]{.mark} at
least [2 percent of GDP to defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### GLO defense

#### International liberal order is overhyped and chock full of falsities

Patrick **Porter '18**, June 5, "A World Imagined: Nostalgia and Liberal
Order," CATO,
https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/world-imagined-nostalgia-liberal-order

According to a view popular in Washington, D.C., and other capitals
around the world, the United States used its power and idealism for more
than 70 years to create a security and economic order that transformed
the world. This world order was liberal because the United States was
liberal. "Liberal" in this context means the pursuit of security both
through the spread of liberty, in the form of free markets and
democratic constitutions, and the rule of law, in the form of rule‐​based
international institutions. Today, defenders of that order fear that
President Trump and a set of regressive forces are laying waste to it.
They claim the consequences are grave: we are witnessing the "end of the
West as we know it,"1 the abandonment of "global leadership" by its
"long‐​time champion,"2 and a "coming Dark Age."3 Foreign Affairs, the
house organ of the foreign policy establishment, recently asked 32
experts whether the "liberal order is in peril." Most agreed it is, with
26 respondents registering a confidence level of 7 out of 10.4 Alarmed
by the political tumult of our time, [[nostalgists]{.underline}]{.mark}
recall the post‐​1945 moment [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [institution
building and [benign internationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and call for
its reclamation.

They [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[in the **grip of a
fiction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Liberalism and liberal projects
abounded in the past 70 years. But [the dream of a unitary, integrated
global system]{.mark} organized around liberalism [is
**ahistorical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In truth, the pre‐​Trump world was
a more brutal and messy place than the nostalgia allows. To be sure,
there was liberalism, and it did help define postwar international
relations. Broadly speaking, the post‐​1945 period was, on many measures,
more prosperous, less violent, and more collaborative than what came
before. One defect of "[[liberal order" nostalgia]{.underline}]{.mark}
is that it [[exaggerates]{.mark} these [qualities and]{.mark} simply
[leaves out]{.mark} too [many contrary]{.mark} historical
[realities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other critics have already noted the
gap between nostalgia and history and that the postwar world was never
"whole." At times the liberal order was neither very liberal nor very
orderly. There may be "islands of liberal order, but they are floating
in a sea of something quite different."5

Not only do nostalgists get the history wrong, they fail to confront
what "world ordering" actually entails. The main critique in this paper
is that [[the fetish for "liberal order" has obscured what is
involved]{.mark} in the process of "ordering" --- or attempting to order
--- the globe]{.underline}. The United States, as the leading actor in
the orthodox narrative, emerges as a power that created order through a
benign internationalist vision, consensus building, and institution
creating. But the [[successes and failures]{.mark} of that order also
[flowed from coercion]{.mark}, compromise, and rougher power
politics]{.underline}. As the ordering superpower, the United States did
not bind itself with the rules of the system. It upended, stretched, or
broke liberal rules to shape a putatively liberal order. Appeals to the
myth of a liberal Camelot flow from a deeper myth, of power politics
without coercion and empire without imperialism.

This fuller narrative is also a story of tragic limits. The world was
not so easily subjugated. Efforts to spread liberalism often contained
the seeds of illiberalism. Multiple orders collided and met the limits
of their reach and power. [Efforts to create a [liberal order ended up
accommodating illiberalism]{.mark}. Liberalism itself proved to be a
conflicted thing. At times, [projects]{.mark} to advance it [had
unexpected results]{.mark}]{.underline}. As it happens, the pursuit of
"[[liberal order" is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}**
just [[an antidote]{.underline}]{.mark} to the current difficulties
suffered by the international system but a source of them.

Ideas about "order" matter and have weighty policy implications. Just as
material power enables or forecloses certain choices, ideas condition
and constrain a country's grand strategic decisions. Those who lament
the fall of the "liberal order" are saying, in effect, that some ideas
are illegitimate and should be off the table. They worry that "populism"
and "isolationism" endanger traditional ideas that were once dominant,
leading America to abandon its manifold commitments overseas, in turn
driving the world into disorder. When they call for the reclamation of
the old order, they also call for the perpetuation of American primacy.
By contrast, this paper argues that the exaggerated notion of [[the
"liberal order" and its imminent collapse is a myth]{.mark} of the
foreign policy establishment]{.underline} and leads America to
overstretch.

#### LIO is ineffective especially when led by the U.S.

Amitav **Acharya '20**, January 14. "Hegemony and Diversity in the
'Liberal International Order': Theory and Reality," E-INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS,
https://www.e-ir.info/2020/01/14/hegemony-and-diversity-in-the-liberal-international-order-theory-and-reality/

Most analysts attribute the uncertain fate of the Liberal International
Order (hereafter [[LIO]{.underline}]{.mark}) to the global power shift,
anti-globalization sentiments, and the rise of populist leaders
spearheaded by Donald Trump. But the [[crisis has longer and wider
roots]{.underline}]{.mark} in what might be called the
hegemony-diversity gap at the heart of the LIO. Supporters present the
LIO as an inclusive order offering substantial material benefits to the
world while remaining open to participation by all (Deudney and
Ikenberry, 1999). Yet, the LIO is also cast as a hegemonic order, both
as a product of US (or US-led Western) hegemony and as the dominant
world order with no real alternatives. This [[simultaneous aspiration
for diversity and hegemony creates a **fundamental tension at the heart
of the LIO**]{.mark}, especially [in the non-Western world]{.mark},
where [the LIO is]{.mark} often [perceived as a narrow ideological,
economic and strategic framework reflecting and advancing the
interests]{.mark} and identity [of]{.mark} the [Western nations led by
the US]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The LIO's]{.mark} performance
[legitimacy]{.mark} from the material benefits it offered to rising
powers like China and India [is **undercut**]{.mark} by its normative
legitimacy deficit in a world of political and cultural
diversity]{.underline}. Meanwhile, in Western nations like the US, [[the
benefits of the LIO]{.mark} offered abroad [have become a source of
**resentment**]{.mark} at home]{.underline}, thereby compounding the
challenge to the LIO. This article focuses on the LIO's relationship
with the non-Western (Global South, postcolonial) world, and argues that
as the LIO loses its presumed "hegemony", instead of claiming to
"co-opt" the Rest, we must embrace the realities of a culturally and
political diverse world.

### Climate defense

#### Oceans prove climate change cannot be fixed

Damian **Carrington '22**, February 1, "Extreme heat in oceans 'passed
point of no return' in 2014," THE GUARDIAN,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/extreme-heat-oceans-passed-point-of-no-return-high-temperatures-wildlife-seas

[[Extreme heat in the world's oceans passed the "point of no return" in
2014 and has become the new normal]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
research.

[[Scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} analysed sea surface temperatures over
the last 150 years, which have risen because of global heating. They
[[found that extreme temperatures occurring just 2% of the time a
century ago have occurred at least 50% of the time]{.mark} across the
global ocean [since 2014]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In some hotspots, extreme temperatures occur 90% of the time, severely
affecting wildlife. [More than [90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse
gases is absorbed by the ocean, which plays a critical role in
maintaining a stable climate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"By using this measure of extremes, we've shown that **[[climate change
is not something that]{.mark} is uncertain and [may happen in the
distant future -- it's]{.mark} something that is [a historical fact and
has occurred already]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Kyle Van Houtan, at
the Monterey Bay Aquarium, US, and one of the research team. "[Extreme
[climate change is here, it's in the ocean]{.mark}, and the ocean
underpins all life on Earth]{.underline}."

#### Aggressive action can't solve

and the Point of No Return," YALE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW,
<https://environment-review.yale.edu/too-little-too-late-carbon-emissions-and-point-no-return>

A recent study asks a related but hitherto unaddressed question: [[how
long do policymakers have to dramatically reduce fossil fuel
consumption]{.underline}]{.mark} to meet the Paris Agreement's 2 degree
target? Using the turn of the century as a benchmark, the study analyzes
when action would be necessary to ensure that in 2100 the world would
meet the Paris Agreement's target. [[Scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}
from the Universities of Oxford, UK, and Utrecht, The Netherlands
[outline what they call the Point of No Return]{.underline}, the year
after which [[even aggressive policy measures would be unlikely
to]{.mark} meet the Paris Agreement's goal by the end of the
century]{.underline}. Unlike previous studies, this research adds risk
to the picture: how would the risk tolerance of policymakers [[affect
the Point of No Return]{.underline}]{.mark}?

### Leadership in Europe fails

#### U.S. hegemony in Europe is not sustainable

Muhittin **Ataman '21**, September 19, "Global leadership crisis: The
U.S. hegemony vs. China," DAILY SABAH,
https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/columns/global-leadership-crisis-the-us-hegemony-vs-china

Today's world is in both a comprehensive transition and a deep crisis.
Not only do rivalries and enmities abound but [today's [alliances
are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [quite **[vulnerable]{.mark}**. The
survival, [duration and sustainability]{.mark} of all these
alliances]{.underline}, rivalries and conflicts [[are in
question]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, [neither conflicting nor
[cooperative relations]{.mark} are sustainable over the long term. All
foreign policy activities [are]{.mark} conducted [on slippery
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, [the direction and pace of any
relationship may change at any time]{.underline}.

Therefore, when we analyze the current global balance of power, we have
to take these conditions into consideration. No global power pursues a
principled foreign policy orientation. Most [countries follow an
eclectic, sectoral and compartmentalized foreign policy]{.underline}. In
this piece, I want to briefly analyze the current foreign relations
tendencies of certain global powers.

Leadership crisis

[[Even though the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} the
most powerful, [influential]{.mark} and important international actor,
[it faces difficulties in maintaining]{.mark} its global
[leadership]{.mark}. As U.S. [relations]{.mark} with other leading
global powers [are in flux]{.mark}, **[U.S. relations with its European
allies are not sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The U.S. is neither
comfortable with the current pace of global relations, nor it is able to
change the pace of these events to accommodate its national
interests]{.underline}.

#### US-EU cooperation no longer functions -- the two aren't key to each other

U.S. hegemony vs. China," DAILY SABAH,

On the other hand, the [[steps taken by the U.S. in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark} region]{.underline} both [directly and indirectly
**[undermine its trans-Atlantic allegiances]{.mark}**. It seems that its
[European/NATO allies will be of lesser importance]{.mark} for the U.S.
[for the foreseeable future]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, it will
continue to cooperate with European countries against the perceived
threat from Russia, still the main \"other\" of the NATO alliance.

**[The [relations between the U.S. and European Union are increasingly
problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [There are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[brief [ups and downs]{.mark}, both alliance and rivalry, in their
relationship. [European countries do not share many concerns with the
U.S. and vice versa]{.mark}. While European countries prioritize their
relations with Russia, the U.S. prioritizes its relations with
China]{.underline}.

### U.S. hegemony unsustainable

#### Multipolarity is inevitable and peaceful -- maintaining U.S. hegemony prompts superpower conflict

Dr. Nadia **Helmy '22**, April 14, "The Chinese theory on "the end of
American hegemony" after the Ukrainian war," MODERN DIPLOMACY,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/04/14/the-chinese-theory-on-the-end-of-american-hegemony-after-the-ukrainian-war/

From my point of view, in my personal belief that **[[the multipolar
international system has already begun]{.mark} to become
clear]{.underline}**, and before the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian
war in the first place, with its many aspects of applications and
features. We can find the analyses done by the "Harvard University" in
the USA, emphasizing that [China is quickly catching up with the United
States of America in terms of (technology, military and strategic
capabilities), despite the dominance of the United States of America
over international finance and research and development]{.underline}.

Here, China is well aware of the (American desire for global hegemony
and the unilateral system to direct the whole world). Therefore, the
United States of America is concerned about the Chinese and Russian
powers, especially after Russia launched its current attack against
Ukraine, due to the interference of the United States of America and the
West in Russia's spheres of influence, with an attempt Ukraine's
inclusion in NATO, with the realization that China is the second largest
developed economy in the world and has enormous military defense
capabilities, and its Russian ally is a formidable military force that
Washington and its allies in NATO fear, which was evident during the
Ukraine war, as well as regional influence. [[Russia and China together
have intertwined and connected borders and sprawling geographic spaces
internally and externally, in addition to the abundance of resources,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the most important thing for me is
[[encouraging]{.underline}]{.mark} their citizens to (belief in the idea
of ​​national tide and a sense of [popular
[nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and strength globally **[[in the face
of American and Western hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}** to stop and
limit their power and call for their national popular leaders to rally
with their leaders).

[[China is seeking to achieve a high degree of strategic cohesion with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, with ([[expanding]{.mark} their [alliances
globally between]{.mark} the developing countries of the South, which
are represented in the [African, Arab and Latin American
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}). Therefore, the United States of America
realizes the strength of the alliance and partnership between China and
Russia, and the strong support for each other politically, economically,
militarily and technologically. China has also become more aware that
[through deep political, economic and security cooperation with Russia,
China will ensure the possibility of forming a multipolarity, with the
presence of more than one international and regional pole around the
world, with an emphasis on expanding]{.underline} this through
([encouraging more different developing countries to join their alliance
to reform the current world system]{.underline}, which is dominated by
American policies and undermines the sovereignty of weak and
marginalized countries by interfering in the internal affairs of
countries to ensure their control over them).

We find that in the face of the American economic power, [China and
Russia together represent about 77% of the gross domestic product of the
United States of America]{.underline} alone, in the current value of the
dollar and in comparison to the purchasing power parity of Russia and
China together compared to Washington, [and]{.underline} in addition,
[the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates of America [is]{.mark} now
[burdened with debt]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has increased to reach
about \$30 trillion, with (the US debt ratio exceeds many times the
value and proportion of its GDP, which [[China is well aware
of]{.underline}]{.mark} about the [[decline in US economic power]{.mark}
globally]{.underline}).

In view of the United States of America's understanding of the
indicators and axes of power, China and Russia, [the United States of
America has become **more and more**]{.underline} promoting
**[confrontational]{.underline}** concepts in their confrontation, as
the most **[threatening]{.underline}** countries to **[the
world]{.underline}**. With the American focus on (the issue of the rise
of China and the ideological confrontation with the Communist Party of
China as a civilization different from the West and liberal American and
Western concepts. As a result, Washington has become more eager to
impede and halt Chinese growth in particular and limit the scope and
limits of the partnership and alliance between China and Russia). Which
the Egyptian researcher has carefully analyzed during the
Ukrainian-Russian war, with the American insistence on the need for
China to adopt a clear position on that Russian war against Ukraine, and
Washington's attempt to take strict commitments against China to ensure
that it does not support Russia economically. This is what China and its
communist leaders have become aware of, and are aware of these American
methods to drive a wedge between it and Russia and President "Putin".

[[The whole world is aware that these close relations and alliances
between China and Russia are the cornerstone for establishing and
forming a multipolar international system]{.mark}, in the face of US
policies that are still seeking to preserve their global dominant
uniqueness]{.underline}. Therefore, [[China and Russia
are]{.underline}]{.mark} trying to expand the scope of their
international partnerships through (the Chinese Silk Road, launching
initiatives for development partnership with developing countries of the
South, African, Arab countries, Latin and South American countries),
because success in this strategy is [[enough to
break]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[American hegemony, and]{.mark} is a
basic **[guarantee]{.mark}** for the [transition for a multipolar
world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Here we analyze the impact of the [strategic [mistakes committed by
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} of
America to [**[destabilize the world]{.underline}**, [by increasing the
**intensity of conflict and international
polarization**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as its inability to
modernize the global system, to overcome shortcomings, challenges and
new competitions, but Washington has created many international crises
in large parts of the world, Such as: (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,
Venezuela)...etc. And its spending of a large budget that exceeded 8
trillion dollars for the war on terrorism, which proved the extent of
the American failure and impotence in confronting it after its
humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban movement's
control of the government. These are the internationally [[failed
American policies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[caused a **state of global
division**]{.underline}]{.mark} in its confrontation.

Therefore, from my point of view, the United States of America is trying
here to (take advantage of the crisis of the current Russian war against
Ukraine to unite the front of NATO and its members in the West in the
face of Russia and President "Putin" under its leadership) to assert its
hegemony and uniqueness globally in the face of China and Russia, which
is what it must be aware of. The countries of the European Union, in
view of the violation by the United States of its covenants and harm to
the interests of its European partners, and the most prominent example
to me of this issue, is the (American signing of the Aukus military
defense agreement with Australia and Britain in the face of France),
which caused the Europeans and France to lose that deal, passing
Washington's interests and its excessive selfishness in dealing with its
European allies by giving preference to its interests over it and
passing it in the face of them, harming them in practice.

On the other hand, [the United States of America failed to adapt to the
changing global economy]{.underline}, unlike China, after a number of
global economic crises, such as: (the Corona virus pandemic, the global
financial crisis in 2008, the Ukraine crisis), and others. Which caused
(millions of American citizens to lose their jobs, especially in the
field of manufacturing and technology), which the United States of
America tried to evade internally by blaming the unfair trade policies
pursued by China internationally in confronting them.

Here we will find the extent of Chinese President Xi Jinping's
insistence, in all his political speeches, to emphasize the concept of
(the common future of humanity), and to emphasize his slogan around (the
Chinese dream), to achieve a well-off society, and to work according to
the principle of mutual benefit for all, and international profit for
all. With President (Xi Jinping's focusing on the path leading to the
realization of this Chinese dream), through three axes, which are: (the
Chinese road, the Chinese spirit, and the Chinese power).

The speeches of Comrade Chinese President "Xi Jinping" are focusing on
the keys and mechanisms for implementing this Chinese dream in an
internationally multipolar world, and the extent to which this is
appropriate for China and the rest of the world. We find that the
essence of implementing this Chinese dream internally is to reach an
internationally multipolar world away from the concepts of American
hegemony. Hence, this Chinese dream of an international multilateral
world has become (the essence of Chinese national identity by seeking to
restore its influence as a force by following China and the ruling
Communist Party leaders for several important policies, including the
axes of development and reform policy plans across China). In the end,
it reflects all (the components of the basic socialist culture and
values ​​of China, as well as that Chinese spirit that is in harmony with
the goals of the Chinese state, the nation and all the Chinese people).

Based on this aforementioned analysis, we can conclude that [[American
hegemony has already ended globally or is on the way to
disappearing]{.mark} or evading, [but **achieving (a stable global
balance of power) is still possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### U.S. hegemony bad

#### Transition away from hegemony in Europe and NATO coop is best for stability

Joshua R. **Shifrinson '21**, January 28, "The Dominance Dilemma: The
American Approach to NATO and its Future," QUINCY BRIEF NO. 8,
https://quincyinst.org/report/the-dominance-dilemma-the-american-approach-to-nato-and-its-future/

In addition, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [faces
diminishing returns, and several negative results, from continuing
its]{.mark} present [approach to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. The alliance
has now been enlarged to the point where few strategically meaningful
European actors exist outside of NATO's orbit, even as those that exist,
such as Ukraine, would constitute a net loss for U.S. national security
by risking a direct conflict with Moscow. In short, little can be gained
from continued expansion. Likewise, [[as European leaders continue
pressing for greater autonomy]{.mark} from the United States and NATO,
[the U.S. will generate **increased friction** with its allies]{.mark}
if it continues to suppress their initiatives in this
direction]{.underline}. This tension, meanwhile, comes at a time when
[[Europe itself is of diminishing relative importance to an American
grand strategy]{.mark} increasingly fixed on Asia, [as most]{.mark} of
the [actors]{.mark} involved [recognize]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
U.S.--led alliance continues moving toward Russia's borders, it may play
some role in driving Moscow and Beijing to cooperate in international
affairs. In short, U.S. policy in Asia complicates U.S. strategy in
Europe, and vice-versa.

[The United States requires a course correction. [U.S. policy toward
NATO now injects a **large degree of instability**]{.mark} and
unsustainability into the region, which ironically possesses the
preconditions for an unprecedented degree of stability thanks in part to
prior U.S. efforts. In consequence]{.underline}, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[should
consider]{.underline}]{.mark} proceeding along four tracks, with the
goal of [**significantly [reducing]{.mark}** the [U.S. security presence
via NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### US could always step back in and stabilize Europe

Joshua R. **Shifrinson '21**, January 28, "The Dominance Dilemma: The
American Approach to NATO and its Future," QUINCY BRIEF NO. 8,
https://quincyinst.org/report/the-dominance-dilemma-the-american-approach-to-nato-and-its-future/

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [ought to prepare
for]{.mark} a **[broader recalibration]{.mark}** of political
responsibilities [in Europe]{.mark}. Precisely because the United States
has other domestic and international obligations, and because
[NATO's]{.mark} European [members are increasingly disenchanted with
U.S. predominance]{.mark}, conditions are ripe to empower the European
allies]{.underline}. The objective should be to strengthen
intra--European solidarity and cooperation while the United States steps
back from active management of European security. [The
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [should pivot toward becoming
the **pacifier of last resort** rather than the manager of]{.mark} early
[squabbles]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are reasons to believe **[[this]{.mark} result [is
attainable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Many of NATO's major European
players, especially France and Germany, have deepened cooperation in
both NATO and non--NATO contexts such as the EU over the past several
decades. [Disenchantment with U.S. dominance and lingering concerns
about Russia provide incentives for sustained cooperation even with a
significantly reduced American presence. The United States ought to lean
into these trends, returning to its vision of the early postwar years by
reducing, limiting, and making more conditional the U.S. presence in the
alliance]{.underline}. Over time, such steps could lay the foundation
for a comprehensive American withdrawal, providing that Europe remains
stable and open to U.S. influence when U.S. interests are involved. Nor
would such a retrenchment sacrifice long-term U.S. interests: [[Should
intra--European tensions spike]{.underline}]{.mark} without an American
pacifier, [America's [lingering connection to the alliance would enable
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to **reengage as
needed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The Biden administration also provides a window of opportunity to
progress and be ambitious in broadening and regularizing NATO-EU
cooperation in the field of innovation and EDTs.]{.underline} While
political dialogue among their leadership has been steadily increasing
over the past five years, the EU and NATO have consulted on their
respective EDTs agendas only twice. Furthermore, bureaucratic procedures
and misalignments sometimes frustrate even staff-to-staff cooperation in
this area. The EU and increasingly NATO are proliferating agencies that
conduct work on innovation in EDTs, including in security and defense.
This makes it challenging to achieve internal coherence of activities
within one organization, let alone coordinating agendas between the
two.As the allies meet with the [EU High Representative for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell]{.underline} at this month's
NATO summit, the [two organizations need a more ambition agenda for
cooperation]{.underline}. In particular, the [EU and NATO need to
consider a joint task force on fostering defense innovation and EDTs,
with renewable two-year mandates. This instrument would provide
political impetus for closer cooperation on EDTs]{.underline}, it would
[give coherence, regularity, and structure to the efforts of the two
sides, and ensure commonality of purpose and synergy of
output]{.underline}. In addition, allies could [consider meeting
regularly in EU-NATO digital summit formats.]{.underline} The EU could
take the lead in this regard given its considerable financial capacity
for investing in EDTs and its regulatory powers. EU-NATO digital summits
would allow the transatlantic partners to regularly review progress,
provide strategic guidance on legal, ethical and adoption challenges
related to innovation and EDTs, and enhance their tech diplomacy by
inviting like-minded global partners to attend.

### DA -- focus uniqueness 

#### NATO is focused on China -- this is the newest card, assumes the recent summit

**Aljazeera 6-30**-22 (NATO declares China a security challenge for the
first time, Al Jazeera,
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/30/nato-names-china-a-strategic-priority-for-the-first-time,
6-30-22) -JV

**[[NATO has listed China as one of its strategic priorities]{.mark} for
the first time]{.underline}**, saying Beijing's ambitions and its
"coercive policies" challenge the Western bloc's "interests, security
and values". **[[The alliance's new blueprint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or
Strategic Concept (PDF), that lays out its priorities for the next
decade, was approved at a leader's summit in Spain on Wednesday. The
document directed its harshest language towards Russia, which it
described as "the most significant and direct threat" to the alliance's
peace and security, but [[said Beijing's military ambitions]{.mark}, its
confrontational rhetoric towards Taiwan and its increasingly close ties
with Moscow [posed "systemic challenges]{.mark}". "China is
substantially building up its military forces, including nuclear
weapons, bullying its neighbours, threatening Taiwan ... monitoring and
controlling its own citizens through advanced technology, and spreading
Russian lies and disinformation," NATO's Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg told reporters. "China is not our adversary," he added, "but
we must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it
represents."]{.underline} In response, **[China on Thursday said it
"firmly" opposed NATO's declaration, calling it a "completely futile"
warning]{.underline}**. "NATO's so-called new strategic concept document
disregards facts, confuses black and white ... \[and\] smears China's
foreign policy," foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said**[. [The
official turn by NATO puts the world's largest military
alliance]{.mark}, based on the United States armed forces, [on guard
against China]{.mark}, which has the world's second-largest economy and
a rapidly growing military, both in numbers and in top-notch technology.
"One of the things that \[China's\] doing is seeking to undermine the
rules-based international order that we adhere to, that we believe in,
that we helped build," said US Secretary of State Antony
Blinken.]{.underline}** "And if China's challenging it in one way or
another, we will stand up to that." Western leaders are concerned that
Russia's aggression in Ukraine, which China is yet to condemn, could
embolden Beijing to be more assertive over Taiwan. China considers
Taiwan a part of its territory with no right to independent recognition
as a state or representation on the world stage. [**Speaking at an event
in Madrid** that was not part of the NATO summit, British Foreign
Secretary Liz Truss said that **unless China is checked "there is a real
risk that they draw the wrong idea which results in a catastrophic
miscalculation such as invading Taiwan,"**]{.underline} referring to the
self-governing island that China claims as a province. Marcin Jerzewski,
head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security
Policy, told Al Jazeera that NATO members may also be concerned about
Chinese-Russian military cooperation on Russia's oft-forgotten Pacific
coast. Before the war in Ukraine, Putin began pursuing his own "pivot to
the east" by ramping up economic development and his military presence
on the Pacific Coast. "This is an important step for NATO and in a way a
sign that NATO is waking up to a new geopolitical reality, which is
largely defined by the growing confluence of Russian and Chinese
strategic interests," Jerzewski said. "Russia has been viewed mainly as
a source of threats in the European theatre, but that view ignores
Russia's physical presence on the shores of the Pacific." Highlighting
NATO's new focus on China, the gathering of world leaders in Madrid,
both inside the bloc's summit and on its sidelines, included many from
Asian nations. It was the first time that the leaders of Japan, South
Korea, Australia and New Zealand were invited to a NATO summit. They
participated in a NATO session on new global challenges after holding a
side meeting outside of the summit. **[New Zealand's Prime Minister
Jacinda Ardern, speaking at the meeting, said China had become "more
assertive and more willing to challenge international rules and norms".
Ardern, whose government has toughened its tone recently on both
security and Beijing's growing presence in the South Pacific, in part
due to the signing of a security pact between China and the Solomon
Islands, said the resilience of the Indo-Pacific region must be
strengthened through relationships and economic architecture rather than
militarisation]{.underline}**. "We must stand firm on the rules-based
order, call for diplomatic engagement and speak out against human rights
abuses at all times when and where we see them," she said. Earlier on
Wednesday, Zhao, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, had accused
NATO of maintaining a "Cold War mentality". The alliance should give up
its "zero-sum game and the practice of creating enemies, and not try to
mess up Asia and the whole world after disrupting Europe", he said. Zhao
also criticised the sanctions brought against Russia by NATO members
over the Ukraine war, saying "facts have proven that sanctions are not a
way out of conflicts, and the continued delivery of weapons will not
help realise peace". China continues to claim it is neutral in the
Ukraine war, and has accused NATO and the US of provoking Russia into
military action. Weeks before Russia's February invasion, Chinese
President Xi Jinping hosted his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for
a summit at which they pledged a partnership that had "no limits".

#### Biotech is not easy for NATO -- magnifies internal divisions and requires wholly new frameworks for coop

However, [NATO and the transatlantic allies are neither the only nor the
most agile actors investing [in **e**]{.mark}merging and
**[d]{.mark}**isruptive **[t]{.mark}**echnologies]{.underline}. China
and Russia already invest substantially in and have accelerated their
adoption of these technologies in military applications. To maintain its
strategic advantage against China and Russia, [[NATO needs to
become]{.underline}]{.mark} an agent of innovation and be **[[more
agile]{.underline}]{.mark}** and strategic in supporting allies to
jointly exploit new technologies for deterrence, defense, and resilience
purposes. [NATO has prioritized EDTs]{.underline} and signaled it has
joined "the technological adoption race" against China and Russia.1
**[[Much work remains to be done]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Allies remain
**divided** on the ethical and legal specifics]{.mark} of the military
use of EDTs [and]{.mark} by their [national-industrial
preferences]{.mark}. Technological [**capacity** across the

**[funding is in short supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Concrete decisions
on how to consolidate innovation in EDTs, a critical task for NATO's
mission and future adaptation, are expected at this month's Brussels
summit. Specifically, allies will respond to calls for a "strategic
surge" in EDTs2 innovation by establishing a Defense Innovation
Accelerator, an opt-in instrument funded through dedicated national
contributions, which NATO hopes will incentivize innovation and
transatlantic cooperation on emerging technologies.3

#### NATO is internally divided over biotech -- plan undermines cohesion

Eddie **Walsh '13**, the President of the Emerging Science and
Technology Policy Centre, a Senior Fellow at the School of Foreign
Service - Georgetown University, and the Director-General of the Pacific
Islands Society, "NATO risks unity over emerging technologies divide,"

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2013/8/10/nato-risks-unity-over-emerging-technologies-divide

Disruptive innovations

At present, the world is witnessing an unprecedented period of
scientific and technological innovation being spurred on by the
synergistic combination of converging technologies, including
nanotechnology, [[biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}, robotics,
information technology, and cognitive science (NBRIC). Such convergence
[[is producing a wide range of disruptive
innovations]{.underline}]{.mark} that may contribute to a "tremendous
improvement in human abilities, societal outcomes, the nation's
productivity, and the quality of life". And, current WMD states clearly
do not possess a monopoly over such innovation.

Converging [[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[pose]{.underline}]{.mark} [fundamental human security
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Francis Fukuyama once argued in Our
Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,
converging technologies could inequitably transform the world we live in
and, in the process, undermine the very foundations that underpin
liberal democracies. Whether or not such a future unfolds, it is clear
that [[their application raises]{.mark} serious [ethical and moral
issues that are proving **divisive for allies**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
enemies alike (eg: the debates over armed drones and cyber espionage).
Even where common approaches can be achieved (eg: combatting designer
drugs), converging [[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} are growing
"faster than our ability to legislate or regulate" them.

The search for consensus

These developments [[are putting]{.mark} new [**stresses** on]{.mark}
the [NATO]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}. According to a recent experts
workshop, the NBRIC Revolution is threatening NATO unity. "As warfare is
outsourced to only those who are 'near peers' in technology and societal
views shift," [[NATO will likely experience "decreasing political
tolerance]{.underline}]{.mark} for alliance security efforts". If NATO
member states want to sustain "the traditional transatlantic compact
\[European political support in return for US military guarantees\]",
they must change the way NATO approaches cooperative security around
emerging technologies. And, they need to do it now.

#### NATO lacks resources -- adopting new tech approaches overwhelms them

Max **Bergmann and** Siena **Cicarelli '21**, January 13, "NATO's
Financing Gap," AMERICAN PROGRESS,
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/natos-financing-gap/

Now, [[with]{.mark} the [COVID]{.mark}-19 crisis [hammering the balance
sheets of all NATO members, the prospect for European defense spending
looks **bleak**]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 [[It seems **unlikely** that
there will be significant new investment to address]{.mark} some of
[NATO's]{.mark} critical **[capability gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Indeed, the European Union---which had planned to increase funding to
upgrade the dual-use infrastructure critical to moving NATO forces---has
reduced its planned allocations in its recent budget.6 [[NATO
members]{.mark} seeking to keep their economies alive [are **unlikely to
prioritize defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This is a serious problem for the alliance, and NATO needs to think
more creatively about how to support continued alliance investment in
the wake of the massive economic contraction caused by COVID-19. [Simply
demanding that countries spend more]{.mark} on defense, which was not
very effective prepandemic, [will **certainly not work**]{.mark}
now]{.underline}.

What has become apparent is that NATO's default focus on individual
nation-state spending commitments was doing little to address
alliancewide issues. Collectively, European NATO members spend as much
on defense as Russia, yet the [disaggregated and loosely coordinated
spending by individual states means that the alliance's combat strength
is well short of what it could be and has left critical gaps in its
capabilities]{.underline}.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, since its founding, [[has **lacked the
resources** to fill gaps and make investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
alliance has overlooked one of its potentially most powerful
assets---the collective economic and financial clout of its members.
NATO has not leveraged its collective financial stature and the position
of its many wealthy members to shore up the alliance. In the wake of the
COVID-19 crisis, this must change through the creation of its own bank.
