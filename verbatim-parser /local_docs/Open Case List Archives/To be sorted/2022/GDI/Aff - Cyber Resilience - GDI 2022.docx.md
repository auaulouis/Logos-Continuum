What Is Resilience?

[NATO defines resilience as "a society's ability to resist and recover
from such shocks" as natural disaster, failure of critical
infrastructure, or a hybrid or armed attack]{.underline}.5

This definition touches on two features of resilience: [**First**,
resilience concerns the ability to absorb and recover from a state of
crisis]{.underline}.6 **[Second]{.underline}**, [resilient actors must
be able to respond to a range of potential shocks, both expected and
unexpected]{.underline}. This relates to the ability to survive; [as one
widely adopted definition of resilience puts it, an actor must be able
"to maintain its core purpose ... in the face of dramatically changed
circumstances]{.underline}".7 This can be seen in NATO's seven baseline
requirements for national resilience, which represent an effort to
delineate the core components of a functioning state by focusing on the
continuity of government and hospital services, energy supplies, food
and water resources, communication networks, and transport systems.8
Conceived as the power to survive in crises, resilience can be seen as a
defensive and reactive concept.

[Resilience is as much about coping with all possible eventualities as
trying to anticipate specific events]{.underline}. While national
preparedness for systemic shocks is now motivated by at least some
clearly identifiable defence and national security priorities, [it
is]{.underline} still [helpful to take a generic approach to preparing
for unexpected shocks. Such generic measures include allocation of
responsibilities at the national, regional and local level; the
requirement for a single lead agency at the centre of government in any
emergency; disciplines for exercising pre-agreed procedures with senior
people involved; and rolling audit programmes to test that these
disciplines remain effective]{.underline}.9

[Resilience]{.underline}, therefore, [has political and psychological as
well as physical dimensions]{.underline}.10 [It can be viewed in
exclusively material terms]{.underline} as shown above, [but also as a
psychological mindset held by groups or individuals which allows them to
function in the face of adversity. Structures and procedures for coping
with shocks cannot ensure national resilience in a crisis if the mindset
for responding effectively is not there]{.underline}. It was this
mindset for recognising and rising to an emergency that was missing in
the UK's initial response to the COVID-19 emergency in early 2020. The
same applies to Europe's response to the Russian invasion of Crimea and
eastern Ukraine in 2014, when the governments of larger European powers
did not fully register the alarm felt on the continent's northern and
south-eastern borders.

[Conceived as a mindset to respond to adversity, resilience thus entails
a "social dimension, located not only in the state but also among the
actors of civil society]{.underline}".11 It [is this societal cohesion
that Russian information warfare has explicitly targeted in its attempts
to undermine the political stability of NATO states.]{.underline} In
response, a wholeof-society approach has formed the basis of NATO's
increased cooperation with the European Union on encouraging societal
resilience, such as the 2016 joint EUNATO declaration.12

[Military, physical, political and societal resilience have the
potential to deter as well as defend]{.underline}. As NATO's Brussels
Communiqué recognised, th[e capacity for resilience can influence the
policies of opponents by deterring them from armed attack or other
offensive measures.]{.underline}13 [Effective and visible resilience is
therefore strongly linked to deterrence by denial. Co]{.underline}ntrary
to the idea of deterrence by punishment, which threatens actors with
severe penalties if they launch an attack, deterrence by denial seeks to
deter actions by making them appear unlikely to succeed.14

In generic terms, [resilience has been defined as a "process linking a
set of adaptive capacities to a positive trajectory of functioning and
adaptation after a disturbance]{.underline}."3 [This]{.underline}
definition [implies that resilience is a process, although it can also
be seen as a strategy or as the "capability of a system to maintain its
functions and structure in the face of internal and external change and
to degrade gracefully when it must]{.underline}."4 It [draws on certain
resources of the system and on "dynamic attributes of those
resource]{.underline}s (robustness, redundancy, rapidity)."5 [This
perspective allows a proactive approach to building resilience by means
of accumulating necessary resources in a system and ensuring that those
resources possess the dynamic attributes required at a time when
disruptions occur. System managers can thereby devise
policies]{.underline} (e.g. principles, norms and standards, priorities
of investments) which are conducive to resilience. This is particularly
applicable to enhancing cybersecurity, which we cover later in this
chapter.

#### Description of current NATO cyber policies and bodies

Administrative Fellow, Center for Cyber and Homeland Security, George
Washington University, "European Union and NATO Global Cybersecurity
Challenges: A Way Forward," PRISM v. 6 n. 2, 2016, p. 129-130\]

[How did NATO get to its current state in cybersecurity? NATO has always
defended its military communication networks; however, during the 2002
Prague Summit, NATO stated that cyber defense was also part of its
agenda]{.underline} and that it would strengthen its "capabilities to
defend against cyber attacks."10 [The Prague Summit paved the way for
NATO's creation of the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability
(NCIRC) in 2002]{.underline}. [Following the cyber attacks against
Estonia in April and May of 2007, NATO issued its first "Policy on Cyber
Defence" in January 2008. It later issued its "Strategic Concept" in
2011]{.underline}, [as well as a newly enhanced cyber defense policy in
201411 in which NATO clarified that Article 5 could be invoked for a
major digital attack]{.underline}.12 [It also pledged to improve cyber
defense education, training, and exercise activities, in addition to its
commitment to create a NATO cyber range capabil]{.underline}ity.13

While NATO does not have a standing cyber defense force per se, its
structures now cover the political, operational, and technical
challenges of cyber defense. [The North Atlantic Council]{.underline}
(NAC), established under Article 9 of the North Atlantic Treaty, is [the
key entity within the Alliance that decides whether NATO responds to an
attack of any nature. The Cyber Defence Committee]{.underline} (CDC),
known as the Defence Policy and Planning Committee until 2014, [is a
senior advisory body that advises the NAC on cyber issues]{.underline},
as does the Cyber Defense Management Board (CDMB). Cyber is part of the
NATO defense planning process that sets force goals for the Alliance as
a whole.14

[In 2012, NATO officials created the NATO Communication and Information
Agency]{.underline} (NCIA) through a merger of a number of existing
agencies.15 Th[e NCIA acts as NATO's principal deliverer of
communications, command, and control (C3), which includes IT support to
NATO Headquarters, the NATO Command Structure, and NATO Agencies. NCIA
is responsible for defense capability planning; command, control,
communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance]{.underline} (C4ISR) [architecture, exercises, and
training; and acquisition and procurement of advanced
technology.]{.underline} NCIA also functions as NATO's first line of
cyber defense and houses both the NCIRC team and NATO's Information
Security Operations Centre.16

Though formally outside of the NATO command structure, t[he Alliance
also relies on work done by the NATO Cyber Defence Center of
Excellence]{.underline} (CCD COE) in Tallinn, Estonia. [The CCD COE
develops doctrinal and legal concepts, conducts training and exercise
programs, carries out technical research and experimentation, and
contributes to national and NATO capabilities]{.underline}.17 [The CCD
COE launched the Tallinn Manual process, which has become the main
authority on the applicability of the law of armed conflict to
cyberspac]{.underline}e. The Tallinn Manual 2.0 will be published in
2016 and will examine international law for cyber operations below the
threshold of armed conflict.

[NATO,]{.underline} much like the U.S. Government, [is intensifying its
relationships with private-sector cyber security companies]{.underline}.
[The NATO Industry Cyber Partnership]{.underline} (NICP) [initiative is
designed to encourage relationships with industry]{.underline}.18 [NATO
is also developing a Cyber Rapid Reaction Team (]{.underline}RRT)19 [to
protect its critical infrastructure,]{.underline} much like U.S. Cyber
Command's Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs).20 The protection of critical
infrastructure under some circumstances may require offensive cyber
capabilities to stop an attack. Unlike U.S. Cyber Command, NATO does not
have an inherent offensive capability.

[Finally, NATO is actively exercising its cyber forces]{.underline}.
Cyber Coalition, a primarily table-top exercise, now includes more than
35 participating countries and has been integrated into NATO's crisis
management exercises.21

In addition, the NATO CCD COE organizes the world's largest
international live-fire cyber defense exercise in Tallinn,which in its
6th iteration in 2016 saw more than 550 people and over 26 nations
participate.22 Using a fictional scenario and virtualized networks, the
exercise involved defenders, attackers, and bystanders. Twenty blue
("friendly") teams, represented by 19 nations and the NCIRC, were tasked
with maintaining networks and services in a fictional country that was
under attack.23

[NATO's trend toward increased cooperation and joint operational
exercises in the cyber realm tends to reflect a broader shift toward
more robust coordination in the majority of its mission
areas]{.underline}. NATO currently does not have any operational cyber
capabilities as an organization, relying instead on Allied
capabilities[. The technical capabilities of NCIRC are used solely to
protect the limited footprint of NATO's own command structure. As cyber
defense becomes an operational domain in its own right, NATO should
consider creating a tactical command similar to those for land, air, and
maritime.]{.underline}24 Given that cyber lends itself to economies of
scale, NATO could also consider developing certain shared capabilities,
similar to its strategic airlift and airborne warning and control
systems capabilities.

#### Decription of NATO policies post-2018 creation of Cyberspace Operations Centre

accessed 6-3-22\]

[Who Are NATO's Cyberspace Defenders?]{.underline}

[The North Atlantic Council is the principal political decision-making
body in NATO]{.underline}, representing the heads of state of all 29
nations in the alliance. As explained earlier, [NATO heads of
state]{.underline} and government made the declaration recognizing
cyberspace as a domain of operations. They also, at [the July 2018
Brussels Summit, declared that NATO would establish the Cyberspace
Operations Centre in Belgium. The center launched in August 2018 and,
still in its early stages of development]{.underline}, is the central
hub of cyberspace operations in the alliance, but its primary role is to
orchestrate the efforts of numerous, existing, and well-established
elements, inside and beyond the command structure, to execute cyberspace
operations.

[NATO headquarters in Brussels conducts several committees and boards
that provide governance, doctrine, and policy for numerous efforts,
including cyberspace operations. Among them is the Military Committee,
the Cyber Defense Committee, and the Cyber Defense Management
Board]{.underline}. These entities set the parameters and identify roles
and responsibilities for cyberspace activities.

[Responsibility to defend NATO in cyberspace]{.underline} "as
effectively as in Air, Land, and Maritime" [environments belongs to the
head of Allied Command Operations, the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe]{.underline}, who has domain advisors for each operational
domain: the commanders of Air Command, Land Command, and Maritime
Command. In a prudent measure, the center stood up within Allied Command
Operations headquarters in Mons, Belgium --- the Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe. In this manner, [the Cyberspace Operations Centre
can leverage the strategic staff capabilities of the existing
headquarters without having to provide them for itself, which also
serves to hasten its development. The center functions as the theater
component for cyberspace, just as the geographic commands do for their
respective operational domains.]{.underline} The deputy chief of staff
for cyberspace is supreme allied commander Europe's domain advisor for
cyberspace. The director of the Cyberspace Operations Centre reports to
deputy chief of staff for cyberspace.

[How Will the Cyberspace Operations Centre Defend NATO in
Cyberspace?]{.underline}

[The Cyberspace Operations Centre cannot defend NATO in cyberspace all
by itself. That will require a NATO-wide approach --- and
beyond.]{.underline}

[The center's mission is three-fold: providing situational awareness of
the domain, planning for the cyberspace aspects of allied operations,
and managing the execution of operational direction to ensure freedom of
maneuver in in all domains affected by cyberspace
activities.]{.underline}

The center executes its mission at both the strategic and operational
levels. It supports commanders with strategic domain advice, planning
support, and integration of effects via Cyberspace Operations Centre
liaison elements who are tasked to directly support the regional joint
force commands and, when necessary, joint task force commanders.

[The Cyberspace Operations Centre provides the central role of
cyberspace defense, and it collaborates with several entities to do so.
In order to achieve situational awareness, it needs intelligence from
NATO's member nations. There are intelligence analysts embedded within
the center to request intelligence from the nations and assess it, and
there are other intelligence organizational elements which support that
function]{.underline}, including the NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre and
Allied Command Counter-Intelligence. The Cyber Threat Assessment Cell at
NATO headquarters provides additional information from a political
assessment perspective.

[Another key player is the NATO Communications and Information Agency.
The agency is the primary communications and information service
provider for NATO and, like every service provider, one of its main
service lines is cyber security. Cyber security, a subset of cyber
defense operations, is a set of practices and procedures necessary to
protect networks and the information that resides in them.]{.underline}
As such, the agency needs to persistently report the status of NATO
networks to the Cyberspace Operations Centre, manage routine cyber
security incidents from a technical perspective, and respond to
operational direction from the Cyberspace Operations Centre when
incidents have operational impact. The agency needs to continue its
cyber security operations, and continuously enhance them, as NATO seeks
to strengthen its cyberspace defense stance.

While the agency is largely responsible for the provision of static
networks, the NATO Communications and Information Support Group extends
them where they are needed operationally for deployed forces. Likewise,
the group needs to respond to operational direction from the Cyberspace
Operations Centre through its deployed coordination cell.

The Cyberspace Operations Centre will also need liaison with its
counterparts in allied nations to share information contributing to
situational awareness. Those mutually beneficial relationships are in
development.

'Safe-to-Fail': Building Cyber Resilience into NATO

The [political and technical [dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline} discussed in
the previous section **[h[ighlight]{.mark}]{.underline}** [t[he
necessity of a **safe-to-fail** strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} for NATO
in the cyber domain. [Cyber [resilience offers a
way]{.mark}]{.underline} for the Alliance [[to address a range of
threats]{.mark} below the threshold of armed conflict to which
fail-deadly and fail-safe strategies fail to apply---]{.underline}such
as ransomware attacks, distributed denials of service, exploitation of
digital supply chains, or operations conducted by non-state proxy
actors. Moreover, [[even low-sophistication cyberattacks can produce
disruptive and cascading effects]{.underline}]{.mark} across societies
with consequences that are difficult to anticipate.
[[Resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[offers a broader strategic
umbrella for the Alliance to plan for, recover from, and adapt in the
wake of unanticipated disruptions]{.underline}]{.mark} from cyberspace.

From a technical perspective, [cyber resilience hinges on the ability of
key information and communications systems to anticipate and withstand
disruptions]{.underline} to service provision by allowing core services
and functions to fail without compromising their ability to recover at
or above original capacity.55 These same principles can be applied to
the strategic level. As a safe-to-fail strategy, cyber resilience is
premised on both the failure to deter and defend against all cyber
threats and the failure to foresee all potential strategic disruptions[.
The goal]{.underline} of cyber resilience [is]{.underline} thus to
[favorably shape the conditions of]{.underline} such [failures by
forecasting, preparing for, and learning from strategic
shocks]{.underline} in or through the cyber domain that can have
unanticipated, multiple-order, and spillover effects.

[[NATO already possesses the strategic foundation for pursuing greater
cyber resilience]{.mark}]{.underline} and has recently reiterated its
commitment to resilience writ large.56 At the 2016 Warsaw Summit, Allies
agreed to seven baseline requirements for national resilience, one of
which seeks to strengthen civil communications systems. This requirement
was updated in November 2019 to reflect considerations for 5G.57 The
Cyber Defense Pledge offers a more specific platform for linking
national capability development to allied resilience. It emphasizes the
need for greater resources, more domestic stakeholder interaction and
information sharing, and better cyber hygiene and education.58 However,
these initiatives have both been couched in the self-help principle of
Article 3 of the North Atlantic Charter, whereby Allies work towards
greater resilience "separately and jointly, by means of continuous and
effective self-help and mutual aid."59 As such, Allies pursue cyber
resilience relatively independently. For example, the Cyber Section of
NATO's Emerging Security Challenges Division (ESCD) conducts a regular
survey of all member states for the Cyber Defense Pledge, but national
responses are voluntary and Allies must individually request information
from previous surveys.

[[Yet, **fully** **incorporating** safe-to-fail]{.mark} principles into
the Alliance [**necessitates** viewing resilience]{.mark} **outside** of
the Article 3 context [as a necessarily **shared
effo**]{.mark}**rt**]{.underline} among member states. The [[limitations
of collective defense]{.underline}]{.mark} discussed in this chapter
[[**highlight** the **potential** for cyber operations to produce
**unanticipated**]{.mark}, cross-boundary
[effects]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Allied [[resiliency is
**inextricably** **interdependent**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[the digital
interconnectedness of allied economic and defense efforts means that the
vulnerabilities of one ally become **vulnerabilities** for
**all**]{.underline}. [Entanglement with the private sector is also an
important confounding factor]{.underline} for members' self-help
efforts. NATO and its members will continue to rely on the private
sector and civilian infrastructure for mission-critical systems and new
technologies. [The speed and spillover of disruptive cyber
incidents]{.underline} like the WannaCry ransomware and the NotPetya
wiperware-disguised-as-ransomware [speak to the insufficiency of relying
only on self-help measures to build cyber resilience]{.underline}.60
Resilience through selfhelp is therefore only part of the puzzle;
safe[-to-fail policies require more formalized coordination across NATO.
Such efforts can leverage consultation mechanisms and
processes]{.underline} derived from Article 4 of the North Atlantic
Treaty,61 and Article 2 provides a powerful basis for members to
coordinate with the private sector and deconflict economic policies
underlying cyber resilience.62

This [shared [resilience must]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be projected
forward]{.mark} outside the bounds of the Alliance [to NATO's
partners]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The same cyber threat dynamics
that make resilience a shared endeavor among members also highlight the
importance of developments in partner and other third-party
states]{.underline} (on partnerships, see Elgin and Wieslander in this
volume). Unlike in traditional domains, [NATO's resilience and
collective defense in the cyber domain are directly affected by the
resiliency of non-members.]{.underline} Ukraine serves as a key example,
as the country has been a testbed for Russian cyber operations with
international implications. For instance, the BlackEnergy Trojan malware
deployed against the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 was later found on US
power grid networks.63 In the case of the 2017 cyberattacks on Ukraine,
the NotPetya malware self-replicated and spread rapidly and
destructively to over 150 countries using the Windows-based exploits.64
These incidents show the tenuous nature of cyber resilience and the need
for the Alliance to aid partners in modernizing and building resilient
digital infrastructures. Article 10 of the Treaty already lays the
foundation for projecting resilience forward to aspiring members65 and
can be used to set cyber resilience requirements alongside more
traditional standards. [[Forward cyber resilience is in NATO's best
interests]{.mark}: the Alliance will be more resilient if its neighbors
and partners are more resilient.]{.underline}

[[Operationalizin]{.mark}g shared and forward cyber resilience as [a
safe-to-fail strategy will require four main lines of
effort]{.mark}]{.underline}.66 First[, [critical cyber
assets]{.underline}]{.mark}, functions, personnel, and intersections and
dependencies, [[must be identified and prioritized]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Prioritization hinges on determining the relative exposure and
significance of assets, how they may be targeted and attacked, and the
areas where greater risks can be assumed. [[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}
and related [[is risk minimization]{.mark}, particularly in terms of
supply chains.]{.underline} One issue that has risen in prominence is
the use of 5G infrastructures and networks. For instance, relying on
non-allied suppliers of military or other vital communications
infrastructures, such as Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE, can entail
increased vulnerabilities for the Alliance.67 Other important aspects of
risk minimization include continuous threat monitoring and the
development of continuity-of-operations plans for cyber crises.
Continuity plans are particularly crucial for ensuring that adversaries
gain fewer and shorter-term payoffs from disruptions like ransomware
attacks or sophisticated wiper worms that delete information. Third,
[f[oresight]{.mark}]{.underline} and long-term trend
[[analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} [are critical for cyber
resilience]{.underline}, as strategic and technological change will
further complicate an already complex operational environment. Threat
actors will continue to develop new doctrines, institutions, and
capabilities for the cyber domain. Emerging technologies, such as
quantum computing, and the increased use of artificial intelligence will
undoubtedly impact the scope, nature, and disruptive potential of cyber
threats to the Alliance and its members.68 In this vein, NATO's proposed
establishment of a defense innovation accelerator is an important
forward-looking development.69 Fourth, [effective cyber resilience
requires]{.underline} not only bouncing back to normal from disruptions,
but also [bounding forward via adaptation and the institutionalization
of 'lessons learned]{.underline}.' Each of these lines of efforts will
require institutionalized cooperation among member states and between
NATO and its partner countries.

[Shared and forward cyber resilience complements collective defense by
addressing a range of grey zone threats to which fail-deadly and
fail-safe logics do not apply]{.underline}. At the same time, [the
[safe-to-fail]{.mark} logic of [resilience can strengthen the Alliance's
ability to carry out its]{.mark} other [core tasks. Resilience makes
collective defense more credibl]{.mark}e, as the continuity of critical
functions and services are crucial for reducing the benefits of
disruption for adversaries]{.underline}. For instance, [implementing a
safe-to-fail strategy helps to reduce the impact of defensive capability
gaps between allie]{.underline}s in the cyber domain. [[Resilience
efforts]{.mark} also [support collective defense by overlapping with
deterrence-by-denia]{.mark}l measures.]{.underline}70 Moreover, and
particularly in terms of crisis management, cyber [resilience can
support efforts in traditional domains by ensuring that
NATO]{.underline} and Allied land, sea, and air components [dependent
upon cyberspace can continue to operate with minimal disruption.
Projecting cyber resilience forward to NATO's partner countries also
provides an avenue from which to strengthen the Alliance's cooperative
security engagements]{.underline}. Finally, the future-oriented and
adaptive nature of [resilience provides an important foundation for
collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security in the
cyber domain to evolve with the emergence of new technologies and
threats]{.underline} as the Alliance heads into the next decade and
beyond.

Recommendations

[[The Alliance can take several steps]{.underline}]{.mark} to better
integrate cyber resilience into its activities as it looks to 2030 and
beyond. This section provides five recommendations to help NATO
operationalize the main aspects of cyber resilience set forth in the
previous section. These are: the adoption of comprehensive resilience as
a core task; the formalization of cyber resilience efforts among
members; the expansion of the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership; the
creation of a NATO Office of Net Assessment; and the longer-term
development of a cyber 'code of conduct.'

[1[. Update the Strategic Concept and adopt a fourth core task of
comprehensive resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Most pressingly, NATO should update its Strategic Concept to accurately
reflect its commitment to collective defense in the cyber domain and to
incorporate a fourth core task of comprehensive resilience, of which
shared and forward cyber resilience is a component. Given the scant
attention to cyber issues in the 2010 Strategic Concept, a new Strategic
Concept is needed to tie together and bring further coherence to a
decade's worth of strategic developments for cyberspace. Moreover, a
revised Strategic Concept is a necessary step for integrating
fail-deadly, fail-safe, and safe-to-fail logics into the Alliance's
cyberspace initiatives. Given the limits of fail-deadly and fail-safe
strategies, safe-to-fail policies that underlie resilience are needed to
address a wider range of threats the Alliance faces in and through the
cyber domain.

[[2. Formalize coordination, consultation, and mutual aid for]{.mark}
cyber r[esilience]{.mark} among Allies]{.underline}.

Resilience as a core task across the Alliance will require moving past
self-help notions of resilience towards a conception of shared
resilience. This move should entail the development and use of common
defensive metrics,71 defensive capability standards, and frameworks for
reporting major cyber incidents. In this regard, formalizing the 'infor-
mation broker' role of the ESCD's Cyber Division vis-à-vis the Cyber
Defense Pledge would be a significant initiative. NATO should formalize
the ways in which the Cyber Division collects, processes, and
disseminates data on Allied cyber resilience. The routine production of
qualitative case studies represents an important mechanism for
contextualizing trends from quantitative data and identifying policy and
technical problems, common deficiencies, 'lessons learned,' and best
practices for addressing respective problems. Just as it surveys Allies
on cyber resilience, the Cyber Division should also develop survey
methods for member states that help identify informational needs -- both
individually and multilaterally -- across the Alliance. The Cyber
Division could thus act as a data repository that facilitates
issue-centric 'minilaterals' among Allies. Concomitantly, the Cyber
Division should explore new avenues for the regular distribution of
cyber resilience trends and findings, such as quarterly reports or
published case studies for all Allies, which supplement yearly
conferences and reporting.

Consultation mechanisms will be crucial transferring skills and
expertise among allies, a key component to help build domestic cyber
exercise staging capabilities in smaller Allies. One such avenue for
greater coordination, consultation, and mutual aid is expanding the
scope of NCIRC so that teams are available outside of crisis situations,
much like the Resilience Advisory Support Teams. While the NCIA does
offer advisory teams, these teams are not formalized like emergency
response teams under NCIRC. Should NCIRC be expanded to include formal
advisory teams, member states could request these teams as an observing
or assessing party for bilateral and multilateral "hunt forward"
missions. Such a role can serve to facilitate NATO's broader goals of
situational awareness, threat intelligence sharing, and vulnerability
assessment.

[3[. Expand the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership]{.mark} on a
case-by-case basis [to include actors in like-minded non-NATO
nations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Building bridges with key private sector actors in non-NATO member
states through the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership72 will be an
important aspect of projecting resilience forward. Companies in Enhanced
Opportunity Partner nations, like Ericsson in Sweden and Nokia in
Finland, represent natural candidates for expansion. The Al- liance
should also look to broader Interoperability Platform Partners with
vibrant telecommunications sectors like South Korea and Japan, home to
Samsung and Sony, respectively. Expanding the NATO Industry Cyber
Partnership on a case-by-case basis can help build greater resilience
into digital supply chains and spur the development of viable
alternatives to digital infrastructures and products from companies in
countries like China.

[[4. Improve cyber foresight and adaptation to future threats]{.mark} by
establishing a NATO Office of Net Assessment]{.underline}.

Resilience requires systematic evaluation of present and future
conditions; as such, NATO should establish an Office of Net Assessment
to institutionalize the Alliance's future-oriented analysis. A NATO
Office of Net Assessment should be tasked with analyzing organizational
strengths and weaknesses vis-à-vis adversaries in the cyber domain. Part
of this effort should include developing metrics for assessing Allied
operational success in cyberspace. Doing so will provide a clearer
picture of the current and future threat environment and should help
reconcile differential threat assessments by Allies. Additionally, an
Office of Net Assessment should play a role in forecasting the impact of
emerging cyberspace technologies across a variety of scenarios. This
forecasting role should extend to the development of wargaming scenarios
specific to the cyber domain as well as for broader cross-domain
operational contexts where conventional forces operate in degraded
communications environments. This effort can look to leverage the
expertise and collaborate with the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center
of Excellence located in Estonia, which sponsors the annual Locked
Shields and Crossed Swords exercises.73

[[5. Develop a cyber 'code of conduc]{.mark}t]{.underline}.'

In the longer term, [NATO should work to develop a normative 'code of
conduct' for states operating in the cyber domain]{.underline} that
focuses on behavior and standardization and complements the work of the
United Nations Group of Governmental Experts. [Such a code of conduct
could presage a formal policy and would be a critical first step in
determining when and how to respond to the cumulative costs of
below-threshold cyber incidents]{.underline} over time. A code of
conduct could also be the basis for promoting best practices for cyber
hygiene and for outlining responsible applications for artificial
intelligence and emerging technologies like quantum computing in
military contexts. Likewise, it can be the foundation for developing
stances on more contentious issues like out-of-network operations on
allied or partner networks and defining violations of sovereignty in
cyberspace. This should ultimately be an intra-Alliance agreement, but
it should be developed with input from key partner states who can
subsequently voluntarily pledge to adhere to the code of conduct.

In addition to behavior, [[a code of conduct can be used to standardize
risk minimization across the Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this
vein, NATO's Standardization Office should be used to develop guidelines
for digital supply chain issues like 5G or software investments. It is
impossible for NATO and its members to scrutinize every piece of new
technology, and formal accreditation or standardization is a slow and
financially costly political decision. For instance, software is one of
the largest attack surfaces of digital supply chains and is an important
component of mission-critical systems. Although it will be nearly
impossible to fully obtain compliance throughout the entire supply
chain, NATO can introduce transparency and visibility with guidelines
addressing suppliers, code authors, product components, and versions.
The Standardization Office can produce recommended standards for vetting
domestic vendors for quality and for screening foreign investments into
digital infrastructure, intellectual property, and technology companies.

While collective defense will continue to be a necessary part of NATO's
approach to the cyber domain, [the Alliance must incorporate resilience
into a new Strategic Concept. 'Fail-deadly' and 'fail-safe' logics alone
cannot address the myriad of challenges emanating from cyberspace.
[These recommendations offer]{.mark} potential [avenues for the Alliance
to implement the 'safe-to-fail' logic underpinning]{.mark} cyber
[resilience]{.mark} in a way that is shared and extends forward beyond
NATO's borders to its partners]{.underline}.

SHARE BEST PRACTICES

[[NATO provides a platform from which allies can work when coping
with]{.mark} individual problems and [vulnerabilities. The alliance can
also help identif]{.mark}y particular [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline},
sometimes before the governments concerned do, and can play a role in
early warning. [[This matters because rapid decisionmaking is]{.mark}
sometimes the [key to success in hybrid
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

THINK AND SPEAK COHERENTLY

[NATO is meeting the hybrid challenge with]{.underline} twenty-nine
[member states experiencing very different sociopolitical
realities]{.underline} and often using different concepts. [[A unified
vocabulary and strategy would limit]{.mark} the
[misunderstanding]{.mark} of threats, [improve collaboration, and
make]{.mark} the [sharing]{.mark} of [lessons learned more
effective]{.mark}---[so would an agreement on the prioritization of
tasks and responsibilities and a shared understanding of NATO's
role.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[This would greatly help individual countries to build compatible and
comparable national strategies]{.mark}. Many of these
strategies]{.underline}, including that of the youngest member
Montenegro, [are in early stages of preparation, but divergences are
already becoming evident]{.underline}. Those that have been
completed---such as Slovenia's 2018 regulation on cyber and information
security or Croatia's 2017 National Security Strategy, which partly
deals with hybrid challenges---have largely opted for different
approaches.

[[NATO]{.mark} member states [must send a unified message inside and
out]{.mark}. As strategic communication is a mind-set, it has to be
built together carefully and fundamentally]{.underline}.12 [NATO's
communication strategy should be a result of joint efforts and hence a
common instrument against all threats, not just hybrid ones, at all
levels.]{.underline}

p. 77-78\]

[Resilience thinking and [being resilient can offer **concrete**
**advantages** in]{.mark}]{.underline} security policy, and specifically
in [[deterrence]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Applied [resilience is becoming
the **cornerstone** of security policy, and represents the **fifth
wave** of deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Modern threats are complex]{.mark}, multiactor, cross-scale problems,
[which must be met with agile, resilience]{.mark} thinking-style
institutional [decisionmaking]{.mark}]{.underline} that fits the nature
of the problems. [[Proactively countering complex threats with]{.mark}
equally networked and [distributed policy responses]{.mark}, guided by
resilience, [will improve the effectiveness of those]{.mark} security
[polici]{.mark}es]{.underline}. In this context, the [increasing
resilience]{.underline} of society, critical infrastructure, and
organizations -- the product of a decade of resilience promotion in
security policies -- [and the concomitant [reductions in vulnerability
will deter asymmetric threats]{.mark} by denying threatening actors
suitable targets for their attacks.]{.underline}

Where classical (nuclear) deterrence was hierarchical and deterministic,
based on the known relationships between the actors, and on the simple
and well-understood principle of assured destruction, which held the
actors in check, modern deterrence is altogether different. [Threats are
uncertain, and unpredictable; actors are unknown, as are the
vulnerabilities they target]{.underline}. As threats have become less
state-centered, and more likely to originate from distributed networks,
the means of addressing these threats must also change.

The fifth wave of deterrence development is rising at a point when
established international security practices are fumbling to respond
effectively to security challenges. [Resilience thinking presents a
potential breakthrough that can increase the ability of established
security institutions to improve their links and address complex threats
deliberatively. If institutions can accept the current shift toward
resilience as an important and practical one, [then the "complex
adaptive system" of international security is more likely to meet future
system changes or disruption]{.mark} in a more prepared
state.]{.underline} The fifth wave of deterrence will be characterized
by the network-driven, tailor-made solution.

Deterrence is an uncertain art, not a science, and if the
decision-making processes that determine deterrence actions do not match
the problems, it is unlikely that practical deterrence solutions
commensurate to modern threats can be identified and deployed.

Modern approaches to national and international security are already
built on networks, but control tends to remain hierarchical and linear.
Dealing with complex threats highlights the necessity to move away from
traditional reductionist and hierarchical approaches to problem
governance, and to engage existing networks with distributed and
deliberative approaches.

To a certain degree, policy failures must be accepted as inevitable in a
complex, uncertain, and unpredictable security environment. But [policy
failures will be more likely if policymaking processes are not suited to
this current security environment. If policy processes are
deterministic, reductionist, and hierarchical, then they are not suited
to governing systems that are characterized by nonlinearity,
unpredictability of interactions, and uncertain feedbacks. By contrast,
if policy processes are designed to match the complex systems and
problems they are attempting to govern -- i.e., if they are flexible,
reactive, and distributed -- then they are likely to be more
successful]{.underline}.

Policy Recommendations

[NATO could resolve the tension between its collective responsibility
for resilience and the continuing national responsibility among member
states for implementing resilience measures by addressing resilience in
the framework of deterrence]{.underline} and defence.

This aligns with the concept of deterrence used in the 2019 NATO
Military Strategy and the 2020 Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of
the Euro-Atlantic Area, which focuses less on crisis response and more
on how deterrence can be used in persistent competition.33 [The growing
use of hostile measures short of war]{.underline}---which prompted the
search for more sustained and wider resilience after 2014---[has
increased the importance of deterrence by denial]{.underline}.

[[Considering resilience within the context of deterrence will establish
the overarching logic of NATO's engagement with resilience issues and
encourage the practicalities of moving towards "collective
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}". [As a form of deterrence, [resilience
policies will need to meet the three key criteria of all forms of
deterrence: commitment, capability and
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}.34

[[Commitment to strengthening resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, already
significantly enhanced among member states after the Russian invasion of
Crimea, [[will be greatly strengthened by the war in Ukraine. It will be
important for NATO and its members to take advantage of the political
capital created by these developments]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
COVID-19 pandemic [[in enacting costly resilience measures.]{.mark} NATO
should therefore focus on four aspects of resilience]{.underline} rather
than the broader seven baseline requirements. [These are: continuity in
energy and essential supplies; the security of the digital
realm]{.underline} to ensure key socioeconomic functions; [maintaining
the independence of critical technologies beyond the control of
adversaries; and the ability to detect and dispel
disinformation.]{.underline}

In terms of capability, [[NATO should adopt a practical approach to
helping the process of strengthening alliancewide
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than trying to "establish,
assess, review and monitor broad resilience objectives to guide
nationally-developed resilience goals", NATO should start the other way
round. [A [similar approach to the NDPP,]{.mark} whic[h]{.mark} consults
with allies about their military plans, [could be taken to encourage the
harmonisation of member state and NATO objectives concerning
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[The NDPP identifies shortfalls in NATO capabilities before setting,
assisting and reviewing the efforts of individual members to achieve
country-specific targets]{.underline}]{.mark} aimed at resolving
weaknesses and strengthening NATO's defensive posture.35 As a process
tailored for each member, "capability targets" are produced for each
member according to the "political principles of fair burden-sharing".36
Though this expectedly produces political tensions surrounding the issue
of what is "fair", it represents a more nuanced and realistic approach
than the adoption of organisation-wide requirements. As argued above,
[[it would]{.mark} still [be advisable for NATO to set]{.mark}
relatively few, [clearly understandable goals]{.mark} that allow for the
positive effects of peer competition]{.underline}, much like the success
of the Defence Investment Pledge of 2014 in which members committed to
spend at least 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product on defence and 20
percent of defence spending on major new equipment within a decade.37
Resisting the temptation to set numerous goals also helps bring clarity
and focus to avoid potential gaps between rhetorical commitments and
policy fulfilment.

Lastly, [[communication]{.mark} with both internal and external
audiences [will be essential to fostering resilience]{.mark} within
NATO]{.underline}. The ability to demonstrate resilience to external
audiences can serve as an effective deterrent against aggressive action.
As with NATO's annual military deterrence exercise,38 comprehensive
preparation and regular exercises can play an important role in
resilience measures by enhancing deterrence by denial. Exercises can get
messages across to allies and domestic audiences.39 Societal and
psychological resilience is also an essential complement to developing
physical resilience capabilities. This was exemplified in 2018 by NATO
partner Sweden's delivery of a brochure to every household titled "If
War or Crisis Comes", which offered advice on what to do in events of
power shortages or loss of internet access.40 The leaflet stated that
"everyone who lives in Sweden shares a collective responsibility for our
country's security and safety".41

[[One avenue for building societal resilience that could be explored by
NATO members is working with creative industries]{.mark} to put across
the need---and help create a narrative---for preparation for crisis
events]{.underline}. Following precedents from the Cold War, in 2019 the
French military employed science fiction writers to assist in
conceptualising potential threats to national security.42 The same logic
could be applied to getting the public to think about unfamiliar
scenarios that may emerge in the contemporary and future security
environment.

NATO's Major Cyberspace Efforts to Date

Cyber defense first appeared on NATO's political agenda at the 2002
Prague Summit, and Allies reaffirmed their commitment to securing the
Alliance's information systems at the 2006 Riga Summit. After Estonia's
2007 cyber incident, NATO members had a greater urgency to address
cyberspace challenges and, in January 2008, approved an initial Policy
on Cyber Defense. With the release of the 2010 Strategic Concept, the
North Atlantic Council (NAC) was tasked with formulating an in-depth
cyber defense policy and implementation plan. By June 2011, a second
Policy on Cyber Defense had been approved by Allied defense ministers.
Cyber defense was incorporated into the NATO Defense Planning Process in
2012, and, as part of the Chicago Summit, Allies centralized and
enhanced network defense under the NATO Computer Incident Response Team
(NCIRC). Subsequently, NATO established the Communications and
Information Agency (NCIA) in July of 2012 to house NCIRC.24 Only in 2014
at the Wales Summit did Allies formally acknowledge cyber defense as
part of the collective defense task.25

[[Allies have taken]{.underline}]{.mark} several
[[steps]{.underline}]{.mark} within the last five years [[to bolster
NATO's cyber posture]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the 2016 Warsaw Summit,
member nations agreed that the Alliance would recognize cyberspace as an
official military operating domain. The agreement also confirmed that
NATO's defensive mandate extended to cyberspace. This recognition built
on developments from the 2014 Wales Summit, where Allies affirmed the
applicability of both international law and Article 5 of the North
Atlan- tic Treaty to cyberspace. The Warsaw Summit thus solidified the
ability of member nations to invoke the Alliance's collective defense
provision in response to cyber incidents. Signaling their commitment to
the Enhanced NATO Policy on Cyber Defense adopted at the Wales Summit,26
the Warsaw Summit also saw Allies agree to the Cyber Defense Pledge, a
set of seven implementation points for improving national cyber defense
capabilities.27 Shortly after the 2016 Warsaw Summit, NATO also issued a
joint declaration with the European Union (EU) aimed in part at
developing broader "coordination on cyber security and defence including
in the context of...missions and operations, exercises and on education
and training."28 This expanded upon a previous NATO-EU Technical
Arrangement on Cyber Defense, signed earlier in the same year to
facilitate information sharing and best practices between respective
emergency response teams.29

The 2018 Brussels Summit provided another important milestone. The
resultant communiqué offered several public affirmations of the
Alliance's Cyberspace Roadmap, a private agreement made among defense
ministers in February 2017 to develop the ability to conduct cyberspace
operations and achieve mission assurance vis-à-vis the cyber domain.30
These affirmations included: identifying cyber defense as part of NATO's
collective defense efforts; signaling that Allies could volunteer
sovereign cyber effects (i.e., effects produced by offensive
capabilities) in service of NATO missions; and announcing the
establishment of a Cyberspace Operations Centre (CyOC) in Belgium to
provide situational awareness and coordinate operational activity.31
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg also signed a new Joint Declaration
on EU-NATO Cooperation that reinforced a commitment to cooperation in
cyberspace.32

More recently, in 2019, the Alliance agreed to a general framework for
integrating sovereign cyber effects and has released a preliminary draft
of its Joint Allied Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations (as of January
2020). The latter provides the most comprehensive overview of NATO's
operation in cyberspace to date.33 Lastly, at the 2021 Brussels Summit,
Allies endorsed the development of the Comprehensive Cyber Defense
Policy to support the Alliance's three core tasks and increase overall
resilience.34

The Focus on Operationalizing Collective Defense

[Much of NATO's approach to the cyber domain has focused on developing
**collective defense**]{.underline} frameworks. Although the Alliance
has outlined a crisis management role for the NCIRC and advanced
preliminary cooperative frameworks for malware disclosures and cyber
intelligence sharing,35 [operationalizing collective defense has taken
**priority**]{.underline}. Article 5 considerations have been the
foundation for NATO's strategic approach to cyberspace, and there are
three 'fail-deadly' scenarios in which Article 5 can be applied. First,
an ally can invoke Article 5 in response to a cyberattack and the
Alliance can respond using in-kind cyber operations as a within-domain
retaliatory measure. Second, NATO can utilize cyber operations as a
cross-domain retaliatory measure in response to a conventional attack
that has triggered Article 5. Finally, the Alliance can utilize
conventional military measures in response to a cyberattack on a member
state that has subsequently invoked Article 5.

Operationalizing and implementing NATO's ability to address such
collective defense scenarios related to the cyber domain has required
several organizational changes, the primary being the creation of the
Cyber Operations Centre (CyOC) within ACO at the Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in Mons, Belgium. CyOC is the primary point
for planning, coordinating, and executing NATO's cyber operations. For
each of these functions, CyOC must rely on Allies to volunteer
operational intelligence. CyOC also provides situational awareness and
interacts closely with the NCIA through the NCIRC for the 'fail-safe'
protection of static networks and extended networks for operationally
deployed forces. As with NATO's geographic theater commands, the
Director of CyOC reports to the Deputy Chief of Staff for Cyberspace,
who provides strategic guidance to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe.
Posts within CyOC are rotational and hinge on a bidding process to see
which Allies will support which posts.36

[NATO only conducts defensive cyber operations to secure its own
networks and to support Allies and their networks when requested. The
Alliance takes a restrictive view of defensive operations]{.underline},
excluding any active defense measures that might seek to disrupt an
attack at its source outside of NATO's own networks. Offensive cyber op-
erations must necessarily be conducted by individual member states,
though national-level offensive cyber operations can be integrated into
NATO operations in two ways. First, member states may independently
conduct an offensive cyber operation in support of NATO operations; this
is less integrated and more loosely coordinated. Second, under the
Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA)
framework, an operational-level NATO commander may request an offensive
cyber effect from allied nations. Unlike with conventional capabilities,
authority over cyber capabilities is not directly handed over to NATO
commanders. Instead, member states retain the capability, providing only
the intended effect. In this way, individual member states maintain
secrecy over the sources and methods of creating cyber effects. In these
circumstances, CyOC is responsible for coordinating NATO commander
requests and the individual member states providing effects. Only five
member states have announced that they will make sovereign cyber effects
available to the Alliance. These are: Denmark, Estonia, the Netherlands,
the United Kingdom, and the United States.37

The Limits of Collective Defense in Cyberspace

[[There are]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, several dy[namics that reveal
the [limits o]{.mark}f the [fail-deadly and fail-safe logics]{.mark}
underlying NATO's collective defense initiatives[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
In short, [[these]{.underline}]{.mark} strategic [[logics only apply to
a **narrow** set of threats]{.underline}]{.mark}; [they will not apply
to the full spectrum of threats]{.underline} presented by the cyber
domain. Fail-deadly deterrence is only likely to succeed in preventing
state-level adversaries from undertaking resource-intensive cyber
operations that reach the threshold of armed conflict with physical,
destructive effects and that are quickly attributable.38 Fail-safe
defensive measures also face several political and technical challenges,
all of which point to a role for cyber resilience.

[[Three]{.mark} main [complications limit the applicability of
the]{.mark} fail-deadly [logics]{.mark}]{.underline} underpinning
collective defense efforts in cyberspace. The [first is deciding which
actors are to be deterred]{.underline}. Compared to traditional
warfighting domains, there are relatively low entry costs for conducting
operations in the cyber domain.39 As such, both state and non-state
actors can target the Alliance. There are also asymmetric operational
costs---actors are faced with multiple avenues for potential gains and
few risks. This means that it will be near-impossible to change the
decision calculus of a malicious actor deploying low-cost, low-risk
techniques such as distributed denials of service. Conversely,
sophisticated cyber operations that can produce strategic effects
equivalent to those of conventional military attacks will have both
significant and costly intelligence requirements that can only be borne
by state actors. These higher 'start-up' costs mean it may be possible
to change the decision calculus of actors seeking to conduct highly
sophisticated cyber operations. [Due to]{.underline} this [asymmetry,
[only state actors]{.mark} undertaking costly cyber operations
**[are]{.mark}** [likely to be deterred.]{.mark} [In **all other**
circumstances, deterrence will be more **prone** to
**failure**]{.mark}.]{.underline}40

[Attribution difficulties present further challenges]{.underline} to the
'who' of deterrence. [Adversaries with rapidly changing tactics,
techniques, and procedures]{.underline}---along with the ability to
easily conceal an operation's origin and perpetrator---[can pose hurdles
to technical attribution.]{.underline}41 Technical difficulties can
weaken deterrent postures by delaying the timeliness of retaliatory
punishment. Moreover, the effects of an operation that a defender
notices may actually be second- or third-order effects. This can add
additional time between attribution and punishment.42 The larger
attribution issues, however, are political. NATO lacks common standards
or guidance for attributing cyber operations in either a technical or
political sense. Indeed, attribution remains a member state prerogative.
Not only are the targeted member states responsible for attribution, but
those members looking to contribute to collective defense must perform
independent attribution assessments, and the political decision for a
collective defense response must come from the NAC.43 Reaching a
consensus decision to trigger collective defense in response to
cyberspace operations is likely to be politically contentious, and
member states will have few incentives to risk revealing the
intelligence sources and methods that underlie attribution decisions.
These dynamics are likely to intensify when additional links in the
attribution chain are required, such as when a perpetrator is encouraged
or sponsored by an adversarial state but lacks direct ties. Attribution
is less likely to be politically controversial across the Alliance once
a conventional conflict is underway as contextual clues from kinetic
attacks can reduce uncertainty. This discussion points to a greater role
for deterrence-by-denial. Deterring an adversary by taking measures to
deny potential gains does not hinge on attribution and thus possesses a
potentially wider scope of application.44

A [[second]{.underline}]{.mark} and related hurdle for cyber deterrence
[[is determining which actions the Alliance seeks to
deter]{.underline}]{.mark}. Much of the activity in cyberspace falls
below the physical effects thresholds associated with the disruption,
degradation, or destruction of computers and networks. Such
[[considerations complicate decisions to invoke Article
5]{.underline}]{.mark}---specifically, the types of cyberattacks to
which Article 5 should apply. Indeed, cyber operations targeting
military assets or critical civilian infrastructure can be incredibly
costly but may not reach damage levels associated with conventional
attacks.45 Moreover, espionage via network exploitation is widespread,
varied, and falls well below the threshold of armed conflict.46
Problematically, such exploitation can be nearly indistinguishable from
operations that eventually seek to attack computers or networks and
produce effects. Network exploitation can even be precursor to
conventional military operations.47

[[Determining how to deter presents a third
obstacle]{.underline}]{.mark} to NATO's cyber deterrence efforts.
[Threatening conventional military means in response to cyber operations
poses dilemmas of proportionality and can risk unintended
escalation]{.underline}.48 Retaliation with cyber tools carry their own
problems. First, the Alliance faces issues of political reliability,
particularly in the context of the SCEPVA framework. Legally, Allies
retain different constitutional restraints on offensive cyber operations
that can hamper the ability to volunteer sovereign effects.
Strategically, states may be hesitant to volunteer their 'best' cyber
effects for fear of burning an exploit that could have had a greater
payoff when used in a national context. Volunteering sovereign effects
can also inadvertently give unwanted insight to an adversary regarding
an Ally's techniques, tactics, and procedures. Second, the temporary and
transient nature of cyber capabilities makes it incredibly difficult to
establish repeatable and predictable effects required of deterrent
threats.49 Finally, signaling in cyberspace is generally ambiguous and
rarely straightforward.50 For instance, an adversary may not even
recognize a signal, believing it instead to be a technical glitch. Even
if a costly signal is received, there is no way to ensure that it has
interpreted as intended.

In addition to deterrence, NATO's [[fail-safe cyber defense efforts face
political and technical challenges]{.mark}.]{.underline} Because NATO
will not undertake any active defense measures, [[actions to mitigate
the effects of a cyberattack are limited]{.mark} to NATO networks or to
individual member state networks when requested. This forecloses the
possibility of developing an institutional strategy]{.underline} to
mitigate the costs of a cyberattack upstream by disrupting the source of
an attack, much like US Cyber Command does with its "defend forward"
posture.51 More problematically, Allies have and will continue to have
different legal, strategic, doctrinal, and threat frameworks for
cyberspace that complicate defensive measures for the Alliance.

Most immediately this means that Allies will locate resources to
different aspects of cyber defense based on individual country
circumstances. [[Different strategic focuses have the potential to
intensify disparate threat perceptions, capabilities, and skillsets.
This can also exacerbate interoperability problems]{.underline}]{.mark};
for example, during an operation or crisis, some systems will be
controlled by NATO while others will be controlled by an ally or a group
of allies with different skill and knowledge levels. In the longer term,
disparate legal understandings, particularly regarding sovereignty in
cyberspace, will become more impactful as a greater number of allied
nations develop forward defense strategies and the requisite
capabilities for out-of-network operations. An out-of-network operation
can in and of itself cause operational friction. However, differing
definitions of sovereignty in cyberspace---and what violates
it---inevitably create political friction between Allies as some look to
operate and produce effects on other Allies' networks.52 This political
friction will contribute to even greater hesitancy over
cyber-intelligence sharing and complicate the coordination of defensive
mitigation measures across the Alliance.

Even if political barriers were removed, there are technical challenges
to Allied implementation of fail-safe measures. Although there are
conditions that can favor defense, such as the ability to manipulate the
environment,53 offensive cyber operations can be both unpredictable and
undetectable. Moreover, cyberspace presents a large and complex attack
surface, where attacks can have unintended, cross-border effects. Given
the sheer quantity of daily network probes experienced by NATO and
individual member states, it is unlikely that every intrusion can be
successfully countered or even identified. Highly sophisticated cyber
operations are also likely to evade most defensive measures. Finally,
fail-safe measures cannot effectively mitigate supply chain risks, as
computers and systems increasingly rely on commercially available
products and internationally based manufacturers. Defensive strategies
will have limited utility if hardware or software components have been
preloaded with malware.54 Each of these technical hurdles can contribute
to slow-downs in decision-making, coordination, and response times for
the Alliance while highlighting the need for greater resilience.

Introduction

[What the war in Ukraine says about cyber power is yet not entirely
cleared from the fog of war]{.underline}. Many aspects remain uncertain,
but given the unpredictability of the Putin regime, the risk of an
escalation in hostile cyber exchanges between Russia and NATO states
remains high. [What is clear is that, as of February 24, 2022, [we live
in a different world in which the European and global security orders
have been shattered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This brief first explores the challenge that cyber threats pose to NATO
allies and how the rapidly evolving cyber-threat landscape can alter the
inter- national security environment. Secondly, it looks at developments
in cyber defense policy within NATO. Finally, the brief analyzes how
NATO needs to adapt to address cyber challenges, studying how allies
align their sovereign interests, capabilities, and cyber doctrines with
NATO operational requirements and strategic ambitions. NATO is set to
issue strategic documents in 2022 that will guide the next decade of its
military planning. This will certainly require more transatlantic
consultation on political-military matters with an emphasis on cyber
security and cyber defense.

The Cyber Challenge to the World and NATO Allies

[[Malicious cyber activity has increased
substantially]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past years while the world
has kept turning amid the omnipresent pandemic and now war in Ukraine.
[[States, non-state actors, and criminal groups compete and are
increasingly weaponizing sensitive information and infiltrating other
countries' networks]{.mark} to steal data, seed misinformation, or
disrupt critical infrastructure.]{.underline}

The coronavirus [[pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat
landscape]{.underline}]{.mark}. In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the
spread of the coronavirus led to social distancing measures, travel
restrictions, and remote work. In a short span of time, IT security
profes- sionals had to respond to the challenges of working from home,
such as enterprise data movements when employees accessed cloud-based
apps via their home internet, corporate software, videoconferencing, and
file sharing.1 Even if hardware and software solutions were in place to
secure the organization's data, there were often no established policies
to help employees wade through the jungle of threats and vulnerabilities
they faced when moving their workplace out of the traditional office
environment.2

According to the FireEye Mandiant Special Report: M-Trends 2021, the
[top five most targeted indus- tries in 2020 were business and
professional services, retail and hospitality, finance, healthcare, and
high technology.]{.underline} The [main methods used were extortion,
ransom demands, payment card theft, and illicit trans- fers.
D]{.underline}irect financial gain was the likely motive for 36% of
intrusions, and an additional 2% of intrusions were likely perpetrated
to resell access. In 2021, data theft remained an important mission
objective for threat actors; in 32% of intrusions, adversaries stole
data.3

[Currently,]{.underline} highly organized[[, technically proficient
criminal syndicates comprise the most significant cyber threat to
allie]{.mark}s]{.underline}. These groups try to steal data or extort
money through ransomware. In 2021, promi- nent ransomware attacks struck
Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the largest fuel pipeline on the East
Coast of the United States; JBS, the largest meat processing company in
North America; and Coop, a major supermarket chain in Sweden. Healthcare
was also targeted---in May of the same year, the entire health service
system of Ireland was disrupted for weeks, and over the spring and
summer, dozens of hospitals in Europe and the United States were locked
out of life-critical systems by ransomware attacks.4

[[Another set of threats comes in the form of bellig- erent
state]{.mark} actors that seek to steal sensitive data for
espionage]{.underline}. In December 2020, Russian intelligence services
infiltrated the digital systems run by US tech firm SolarWinds and
inserted malware into its code. During the company's next software
update, the virus was inadvertently spread to about 18,000 clients,
including large corporations, the Pentagon, the State Department,
Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US government agencies. The
hack went unde- tected for months before the victims discovered vast
amounts of their data had been stolen.5

There are [[also politically motivated cyberattacks mandated by states
that interfere in democratic processes]{.mark} and political
discourse]{.underline}. In September 2020, the internal email system of
Norway's parliament was hacked.6 Ine Eriksen Søreide, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of Norway, underlined the significance of the attack by
calling it an important cyber incident that affected the "most important
democratic institution" of the country.7 Norwegian authorities later
identified Russia as the actor responsible for the attack, marking the
first time that Norwegian authorities had made a political attribution
to such an attack.

Since the beginning of this year, [[Ukraine's govern- ment has been hit
by a series of cyberattacks]{.mark} that defaced government websites and
wiped out the data on some government computers]{.underline}. In
mid-Jan- uary, hackers defaced about 70 Ukrainian websites, including
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Energy, Education, and
Science, as well as the State Emergency Service and the Ministry of
Digital Trans- formation, whose e-governance portal gives the Ukrainian
public digital access to dozens of govern- ment services. The hackers
replaced the home pages of about a dozen sites with a threatening
message: "be afraid and expect worse." After a couple of days,however,
most of the sites were restored.8 The [inter- national hacktivist
collective Anonymous has declared "cyberwar" against Russia's
government, claiming credit for several cyber incidents]{.underline}
including distrib- uted denial of service attacks that took down Russian
government websites and Russia Today, the state- backed news service.9

Around the globe, [[aging critical infrastructure has long been
vulnerable]{.mark} to attack.]{.underline}

The [[most worrying type of cyberattack is sophis- ticated
malware]{.mark} designed by states or state-backed actors [that act as
"time bombs" in the critical cyber networks]{.mark} of target countries,
such as the energy, telecom, and transportation sectors]{.underline}.
Around the globe, aging critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable
to attack. In 2020, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a
warning of Russian attacks on millions of routers, firewalls, and
devices used by infrastruc- ture operators and government agencies.10

On the day of the Russian invasion, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed
satellite broadband services, was hacked along with one of its
satellites Ka-Sat, whose users included Ukraine's armed forces, police,
and intelligence service. [Destructive wiper malware attacks by Russia
against Ukraine]{.underline} included Whisper- Gate, discovered in
January by Microsoft, in Ukraine's networks that "provide critical
executive branch or emergency response functions";11 HermeticWizard and
IsaacWiper,12 [targeting multiple Ukrainian orga- nizations just hours
before the Russian invasion began]{.underline}; and CaddyWiper, spotted
by researchers at the Slovak internet security company ESET in
mid-March.13 [All of them were designed to wipe or overwrite critical
files on infected systems and leave computer hard drives corrupted and
unrecoverable.]{.underline} These incidents demonstrate that, in the
words of cyber expert and Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank
chairman Dmitri Alperovich, ["[Cyberattacks have become a theater for
great-power conflict in which governments and militaries fight in the
hybrid 'gray zone]{.mark},']{.underline} where the boundaries between
peace and war are blurred."14 The actors navigate a complex web of
ambiguous and deeply interconnected challenges, where [[cyberattacks are
not a separate front, but rather an extension of the
conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Russia and China challenge NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and its members
[[in cyberspace on a **daily basis**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as [[part of
ongoing hybrid campaigns to undermine the transatlantic
community]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Kremlin's [actions have involved
intrusions into]{.underline} Allies' [critical infrastructures,
manipulating]{.underline} Allies' [elections through hacks and
disinformation]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} even [blocking GPS
information critical to NATO activities]{.underline}. The [Chinese

[and disinformation]{.underline} against transatlantic countries,
including around the coronavirus[. [These efforts to **weaken** NATO
countries and Alliance **cohesion** represent a **persistent
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} to Allied security.

NATO has recognized the collective dangers of these hybrid attacks in
cyberspace. Up to this point, however, [[the Alliance has taken a
reactive approach,]{.mark} responding as if Russian and Chinese cyber
attacks are each isolated incidents]{.underline}. But because Russian
and Chinese cyber efforts are part of continuous campaigns directed at
the overall capability of the Alliance, [[NATO's response has been
insufficient, failing to reduce or dissuade further
attacks]{.mark}.]{.underline} To assure the security of its members
going forward, NATO needs its own continuous response campaign to these
threats.

#### 2---They also threaten [NATO operations]{.underline}---facilitated by [emerging vulnerabilities]{.underline} and the [democratization]{.underline} of [technology]{.underline}

The [technologies]{.underline} highlighted in this paper may [contribute
to the exacerbation of current trends in the cyber threat landscape and
herald]{.underline} so-called **[grey swan scenarios]{.underline}**.5
The [[increasing availability of]{.mark} powerful, easy-to-use and
[inexpensive]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nologies [[is likely to further
stimulate]{.mark} the conduct of [malicious activities
by]{.mark}]{.underline} a wide array of [[state and non-state
actor]{.underline}s]{.mark}. The
**[[democratisation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and 'servitisation'6 [[of
technology have enabled]{.underline}]{.mark} consumer
[[access]{.underline} [to a wide range of technologies
t]{.underline}]{.mark}[hat were previously accessible only by
governments]{.underline}. This includes enabling technologies like
additive manufacturing and largescale distributed computing, to more
niche technological services such as ondemand development of bespoke
software-defined radio applications that could be used for disrupting
the electromagnetic environment. While most of these activities are
likely to entail low-tech tactics, [this trend could result in an even
greater volume of malicious activities]{.underline} than currently
witnessed.

[The [development of new]{.mark}, complex technological solutions and
[capabilities]{.mark} may also enable state-sponsored actors to conduct
advanced, covert or persistent attacks and activities which [could
undermine or jeopardise NATO's missions]{.mark} and day-to-day
operations]{.underline} [by]{.underline}, for example, [[exploiting
unknown vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the NATO supply chain to
gain access to sensitive information. [Sophisticated and persistent
attacks are likely to be less frequent, making these threats more
challenging for NATO to identify, detect, prepare for and
manage]{.underline} due to limited exposure to and knowledge of the
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) employed. The [[proliferation
of connected and embedded systems]{.underline},]{.mark} particularly
through a drive towards the Internet of Things (IoT) [[and the
digitalisation of legacy infrastructure may also increase]{.mark} NATO's
attack surface and [the likelihood of vulnerabilities that could be
exploited]{.mark} by malicious]{.underline} [actors]{.underline}.

#### D--- A strong NATO is the cornerstone of global stability

accessed 6-11-22\]

Mr. Chairman and Mr. Menendez, you have asked for an assessment of
NATO's value to the United States. In my judgment, [NATO continues to be
of vital importance]{.underline} [to American security]{.underline}
interests in five principal ways. First, [[NATO]{.mark} [is]{.mark} at
the [core]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} one of the most significant
foreign policy accomplishments]{.underline} [in American
history]{.underline}---[the creation of a long-term [peace in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} following the close of the Second World War.
[Because of NATO]{.underline} and the emergence of the European Union,
[Europe is [united]{.mark}]{.underline} [[after centuries of]{.mark}
division and [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [NATO's military strength has
been a [major reason]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} the [absence of
war]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the Soviet Union
and [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} since 1949. A recent Atlantic Council
study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent of its GDP on defense
during the First World War, 37.5 percent during the Second World War and
13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close to those
levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have enjoyed
for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that peace. And
due to the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastward after the
fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live in free,
democratic societies---a significant success for U.S. diplomacy. Second,
[NATO delivers]{.underline} additional [benefits to]{.underline} U.S.
[military objectives and operations]{.underline} beyond our shores.
[NATO is at the [heart of]{.mark} our [defense]{.mark}]{.underline} [of
North America]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Europe]{.underline} [[from
nuclear and conventional threats]{.underline}]{.mark}. British and
French nuclear weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the North
Atlantic area. Since the late 1940s, every Administration has believed
that [the best way]{.underline} [to defend our country is through
American forces forward deployed in Europe with the NATO
allies]{.underline}. [This strategy remains right for today given
Russia's invasion of Georgia]{.underline} in 2008, [of Crimea and
Eastern Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 [and its current pressure on
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [NATO remains our
[primary vehicle for deterring Putin]{.mark}]{.underline} in Eastern
Europe. The [NATO allies host a great number of [critical bases
for]{.mark} U.S. forces]{.underline}---Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in
Italy, Rota in Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in Turkey---[that
serve as a platform]{.underline} [for our presence in Europe, as well as
for U.S. [force projection against terrorist groups]{.mark}]{.underline}
[in North Africa and the Middle East and for]{.underline} our [continued
military operations in Afghanistan]{.underline}. [Europe is a critical
link]{.underline} [in the development of our Ballistic Missile Defense
network]{.underline} focused on the Middle East with Turkey, Romania,
Poland, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and other
allies all hosting elements of this system. [NATO allies]{.underline}
continue to [participate in the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic
State]{.underline} in the Middle East. [Many of the allies play [lead
roles]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} other [[counter
terror]{.mark} operations]{.underline} [such as French forces in
Mali]{.underline} supported by the U.S. In Afghanistan, the [NATO allies
remain with us in combat operations and in training the Afghan
military]{.underline}. Over 1000 soldiers from European and other
partner nations have died there during the last seventeen years. [NATO
continues to maintain the hard-earned peace in Kosovo]{.underline} [with
European troops bearing the large share of the burden]{.underline}. An
EU-led force has taken on all of the peacekeeping responsibility in
Bosnia, freeing up the U.S. for other activities. Third, [the NATO
allies are among our closest and most supportive global partners as we
[confront]{.mark} the great [transnational
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} that define this century---[the fight
against [terrorism]{.mark}, the entire complex of [cyber]{.mark}
threats, [climate change]{.mark}, the risk of [pandemics]{.mark}, mass
[migration]{.mark}]{.underline} [and others]{.underline}. The
[[NATO]{.mark} allies]{.underline} and our partners in the European
Union [act together]{.underline} with us on these and other issues.
[This [is of]{.mark} [incalculable benefit]{.mark}]{.underline} [to the
U.S]{.underline}. [Neither Russia nor China have treaty
allies]{.underline}. [NATO is a significant advantage]{.underline} [for
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [when it acts as a [force
multiplier for American interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Note: C3I = command, control, communications, and intelligence

Summary

 [[NATO's nuclear capability]{.mark} is provided by the US and the
UK]{.underline}. The [modernization]{.underline} of systems and arsenals
held by both states is proceeding apace. This [[has
involved]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and continues to involve -- the
[integration and [use of increasingly sophisticated]{.mark} new
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline} within their nuclear programmes,
including in their respective command, control and communication (C3)
systems.

 [[Cyber operations targeting]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO members' [[C3
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} and their assets, including nuclear assets,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[increasingly
sophisticated]{.underline}]{.mark} in nature. While cybersecurity is a
serious concern, and there is acknowledgment of the potential magnitude
of cyberattacks, documentation available in the public domain indicates
the need for NATO and its members to put in place further measures to
ensure the cybersecurity of C3 systems, including those of nuclear
systems (NC3). This is all the more pertinent given that some [Allies'
military capabilities still include legacy systems from]{.underline}
[the Soviet era.]{.underline}

 The [[protection of C3 systems requires]{.underline}]{.mark} the
adoption of adequate, adaptable and [[robust cybersecurity]{.mark}
measures]{.underline}, in order [[to ensure]{.mark} the
[integrity]{.mark} of these systems [and]{.mark} to [shield]{.mark} them
[from]{.mark} both internal and external
[disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}. The following five considerations are
of relevance for the protection of NATO's own C3 systems, and those of
its member states: software and network protection; data (integrity)
protection; hardware protection; access/security controls; and
cybersecurity awareness/security by design. These attest to the need for
robust measures beyond the non-kinetic, digital realm to ensure the
cybersecurity of NATO's C3 ecosystem.

 The [[increasing reliance on C3 assets]{.underline} [that may be used
for both conventional and nuclear operations raises the prospect of
entanglement,]{.underline} [and the associated risk of rapid
escalation]{.underline}. [The potential for unintended escalation
is]{.underline} ]{.mark}[further [exacerbated by the threat of
cyberattacks]{.mark} and possible new threats emanating from other
emerging technologies, including quantum computing.]{.underline} Unknown
and unanticipated effects from cyber operations targeted at C3 assets
may compromise the legality of these attacks when such assets may be of
both military and civilian use simultaneously.

 [Measures to prevent misinterpretation and rapid escalation are
critical to the security of C3 systems]{.underline}. Such measures could
include a clearer understanding of: how adversaries think about command
and control; what would constitute a cyberattack in the context of C3
systems; and what would constitute adequate responses to such attacks
within the frameworks of international law -- particularly international
humanitarian law.

 [False confidence and false stress are equally problematic. In
addition to ensuring]{.underline} the [cybersecurity]{.underline} of
their existing nuclear planning and NC3 architecture[, NATO and Allies
must reflect on how these dynamics will affect current understanding,
arrangements and strategies surrounding the concept of nuclear
sharing]{.underline}. Concerns over legacy infrastructure, in the
context of an evolving threat landscape and the modernization of systems
with digital means, raise questions with regard to the way forward for
the hosting of US nuclear weapons in Europe, as well as for existing
nuclear burden sharing agreements.

[The [last several years have seen calls for NATO to **embrace**]{.mark}
strategic [**resilience**,]{.mark} and]{.underline} the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic [has]{.underline} both [amplified
and accelerated debates surrounding resilience]{.underline}. One
recommendation that has emerged is that [[NATO should adopt
"comprehensive resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}" as a fourth core task
alongside the three existing tasks of collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security laid out in the 2010 Strategic
Concept. [Resilience has generally referred to the ability to
"anticipate, prevent, and...protect against and bounce forward from
disruptions to restore critical functions]{.underline}."1 [Comprehensive
[resilience is thus meant to address a range of challenges]{.mark}
facing the Alliance and is necessarily a shared endeavor that can be
projected forward outside the membership bounds of NATO]{.underline}.2
This chapter addresses one dimension of comprehensive resilience by
highlighting the Alliance's cybersecurity challenges and the strategic
necessity of resilience in the cyber domain.

The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [has highlighted that cybersecurity
encompasses more than "cyber war]{.underline}"3 [by underscoring the
reliance of nations and their economies on cyberspace and digital
infrastructures]{.underline}. Massive [migrations to online services
have occurred with]{.underline} the transition to remote telework and
education, among other [vital societal activities. NATO itself has been
no exception,]{.underline} as the Alliance worked to facilitate remote
work by shipping critical communication and information systems items to
NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) support teams across
various countries. This effort included simultaneously shipping laptops
from its Headquarters in Belgium to Allied Command Transformation (ACT)
in Virginia, United States and shuttling devices across European borders
to Mons, Belgium to ensure business continuity for Allied Command
Operations (ACO).4 [Pandemic-induced shifts into business and
operational continuity plans have thus brought to the forefront security
issues like threats to digital supply chains]{.underline}, which have
become even more salient in the wake of the SolarWinds hack.5 Recent
high[-profile ransomware attacks]{.underline} against US companies
Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods [have only intensified the need to
secure supply chains from digital threats]{.underline}.6

Concomitantly, broader [questions have arisen about NATO's strategic
approach to cyberspace]{.underline}. The most recent Strategic Concept,
released in the wake of the 2010 Lisbon Summit, provides few clues as to
how collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security
relate to cyberspace. In fact, the document only mentions the word
"cyber" five times.7 [[An urgency to reconsider NATO's efforts in the
cyber domain has been evidenced]{.mark} by recommendations from the NATO
2030 Reflection Group]{.underline}, which devoted an entire sub-section
of its report to hybrid and cyber threats. In particular, [the
Reflection Group highlighted the need to develop both greater collective
defense capacity in cyberspace and a more robust consultation
framework]{.underline} to facilitate collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security in the domain.8 These concerns were
largely echoed by Allies in the recent 2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué.9

This chapter argues that [[for NATO to effectively address]{.mark} the
broad range of security [challenges]{.mark} emanating
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} domain, [the
[Alliance must]{.mark} complement its current collective defense efforts
by **[incorporat]{.mark}**ing [resilience and "safe-to-fail"
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} into a new Strategic Concept. [The
unique dynamics of cyberspace mean that [resilience must be]{.mark} [a
shared effort among members, and]{.mark} it must be [projected outside
the Alliance's borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This chapter]{.underline}
therefore [recommends that NATO adopt a fourth core task of
comprehensive resilience that includes shared and forward cyber
resilience as a major component.]{.underline} While NATO has thus far
prioritized the operationalization of collective defense in cyberspace[,
the strategic logics that underpin collective defense will not apply to
the full spectrum of threats presented by the domain.]{.underline} [Part
of the challenge]{.underline}, then, [is to reframe the Alliance's cyber
security conversations to acknowledge the limits of collective
defense]{.underline}.

[NATO's ongoing efforts to operationalize collective defense have relied
primarily on 'fail-deadly' and 'fail-safe' logics]{.underline}. On the
one hand, the Alliance has drawn on deterrence principles in attempts to
discourage and prevent adversarial actions in and through cyberspace
through the imposition of costs that would outweigh potential gains.10
[While denial strategies are vital to cost imposition,
deterrence-by-punishment has been the strategic bedrock of NATO's recent
initiatives]{.underline}. [The threat of retaliatory punishment is
traditionally a 'fail-deadly' strategy]{.underline}: should an adversary
undertake an undesired action, i.e., deterrence fails, the Alliance
responds with the use of deadly force. On the other hand, [NATO has also
focused on implementing defensive measures to minimize the damage and
fallout from an attack in or through cyberspace]{.underline}. Such a
'fail-safe' strategy seeks to ensure that, should deterrence fail, the
Alliance and its members retain the ability (albeit degraded) to operate
safely and securely in the cyber domain.

[Combined, [fail-deadly and fail-safe strategies look]{.mark} to prevent
and [mitigate]{.mark} of the [costs of adversarial actions]{.mark} in
the cyber domain]{.underline}. [[In contrast,
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} in cyberspace---[the ability to
anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to strategic shocks or
surprises occurring in or through the cyber
domain]{.underline}11---[[emphasizes passive protection,
risk-minimization, and forward-looking continuity-of-operations
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 Unlike NATO's current approach to
collective defense, [[resilience rests on 'safe-to-fail'
principles]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a 'safe-to-fail strategy,'
[resilience is built on the assumption that, despite deterrent and
defensive measures, the [Alliance may fail to foresee adverse strategic
disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline} that remove the ability to operate and
coordinate in the cyber domacain. [To withstand and bounce forward from
such disruptions, [NATO must ensure that military cyber functions and
capabilities fail safely]{.mark}---that is, to fail in ways that do not
remove the ability to recover at or above original operating capacity.
[Resilienc]{.mark}e thus [offers a way for the Alliance to account for a
variety of threats]{.mark} and scenarios [to which fail-deadly and
fail-safe strategies prove ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same
time, [[resilience serves to enhance collective defense in the cyber
domain: collective defense is more credible if the Alliance is more
resilient]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This chapter proceeds in the following sections. The first describes the
cyber threats facing the Alliance. The second section outlines NATO's
policy and organizational developments related to cyberspace. The third
section discusses the limitations of collective defense; in short,
collective defense efforts are best suited for countering the small
subset of cyber incidents that reach damage levels analogous to
conventional uses of force. The fifth section explores what cyber
resilience looks like for NATO and why it must be a shared phenomenon
that is projected forward outside the Alliance. The chapter concludes
with several recommendations for the Alliance as it looks ahead to 2030
and beyond.

### Advantage Two: Russia

#### A---Russia is pursuing a [hybrid warfare]{.underline} strategy to [weaken]{.underline} the alliance and [undermine]{.underline} the U.S.-led [international order]{.underline}

**Speranza, Center for European Policy Analysis director, '20**

for European Policy Analysis, "A Strategic Concept for Countering
Russian and Chinese Hybrid Threats," Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security, Atlantic Council, 7---20, p. 13-15\]

[[For Russia, hybrid warfare is a]{.mark} set of [means]{.mark} for it
[to]{.mark} roll back the post-Cold War settlement and [undermine
the]{.mark}]{.underline} predominantly [US-led[,]{.mark} rules-based
[international order]{.mark} to regain clout]{.underline} as a major
player on the global stage. The Kremlin's [[**key**
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark} to that end [[include: dividing and
weakening NATO]{.mark} and the EU]{.underline}, both of which the
Kremlin sees as a threat; [[subverting pro-Western governments]{.mark}
and institutions; promoting pro-Russia policies; expanding Russia's
sphere of influence]{.underline} (geographically, economically,
politically, etc.); [and establishing a "moral equivalence" between
Russia and the West]{.underline}.3 Moreover[, [hybrid activities help
the Kremlin pursue these goals]{.mark} in a more effective and realistic
way]{.underline}. Its leaders recognize Russia cannot necessarily
counter or outright compete with the West militarily, technologically,
or economically. [By employing hybrid methods as part of an overarching
strategy of intimidation]{.underline}, however, [the Kremlin can have
significant influence over international affairs]{.underline}.4

[[Russia's hybrid toolkit is]{.mark} multi-level and often country
specific, which has made it [highly effective and difficult to
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its most widely known example, Russia
used below-threshold force to illegally invade eastern Ukraine and annex
Crimea. The Kremlin has also used proxies and privately contracted
forces to influence the outcome of conflicts abroad, from Syria to
Libya. Other examples of Russia's low-level uses of force include
attempted assassinations of pro-Western leaders and the use of deadly
chemical attacks to target political enemies on foreign soil. In terms
of cyber and operational activities, [Russia has conducted reckless and
dangerous cyberattacks, infiltrated critical infrastructure]{.underline}
in the United States, and manipulated gas pipelines, electric grids, and
financial systems in Eastern Europe and beyond [to increase its leverage
abroad]{.underline}.

With respect to political subversion and economic coercion, [Russia has
interfered in elections]{.underline} in the United States and across
Europe [in attempts to divide transatlantic populations]{.underline} and
influence the outcomes toward candidates the Kremlin views as favorable
to Russia. Other tools and tactics include: bribing officials in foreign
countries; financing anti-European parties in Central and Eastern Europe
to promote pro-Russian narratives; and investing in strategic sectors in
foreign countries to maximize dependency on Russia. On the
information-warfare front, the Kremlin has orchestrated widespread
disinformation campaigns and strategic hack-and-release efforts designed
to sow doubt, create chaos, and sway public opinion in its favor on key
policy issues.

While Russian hybrid activities can be traced much further back than
these examples---including to the major cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007
and the Russo-Georgia conflict in 2008---they have been steadily
increasing since the Kremlin's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Looking ahead, several elements could impact the future course of
Russia's hybrid actions. First are the constitutional changes that
Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed through national courts to
reset presidential term limits.5 The reforms allow Putin to remain in
power until 2036, or possibly for life, pending a final national
referendum.6 With his grip on power soon to be cemented, Putin is likely
to attempt more aggressive hybrid actions, knowing the domestic
political risks for him are low.

Another factor is the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered a
global recession and a drastic decline in demand for oil so critical to
Russia's energy-reliant economy. In early 2020, Russia and Saudi Arabia,
the world's biggest crude producers, failed to agree to mutual
production cuts in response to the crisis, fueling a price war that
further hurt Russia's economy.7 Economic, public health, and social
pressures inside Russia could push the Kremlin to temporarily scale back
its ambitions in the short term. However, at the same time, uncertainty
and anxiety around the pandemic could create more fertile conditions for
Russia's hybrid activities beyond its borders, especially as
Euro-Atlantic governments take extraordinary domestic measures to
respond.8 In the long term---even as the pandemic subsides, oil prices
rebound, and the global economy begins to recover---conditions will
remain difficult for Russia, whose economy has suffered from stagnation
and sanctions from the West. These [dynamics may lead Putin to be more
assertive with hybrid strategies abroad with the aim of appealing to
nationalist sentiments at home in order to quell domestic political
tensions]{.underline}.

[[Further emboldening Putin is the lack of]{.mark} traditional
[US]{.mark} leadership and [pushback]{.mark} that has helped to keep
Russia in check]{.underline}. US President Donald Trump has instead
tried to appeal to Putin, describing his own policy as "getting along
with Russia" and reducing perceived or actual consequences of hybrid
actions against the United States. Political allegations of the Trump
campaign "colluding" with Russia to affect US elections9 have further
divided the American public toward Russian aims, creating more fertile
ground for the Kremlin's malign influence.10 Compounding this is fraying
transatlantic solidarity, whether the USGermany feud over defense
spending or French President Macron's comments that NATO is
"braindead."11 [These divisions not only constrain the West's response
to Russia's hybrid actions, but also expose cracks in the Alliance that
Putin is all too eager to exploit]{.underline}.

Together, these factors indicate that as long [as Putin remains in
power, the [Kremlin will likely continue escalating hybrid
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} short of an all-out war with
NATO, [to push boundaries and test what is acceptable going
forward]{.underline}. In the relative near term, [the [transatlantic
community must plan according to Russia's current trajectory on hybrid
issues, which demands a more proactive]{.mark} and widespread
[approach]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Hybrid" scenarios: trigger for conflict?

[[One can envisage a number of "hybrid" scenarios of Russia-NATO
conflict where operations]{.mark} which started]{.underline} in the
cyber, economic, criminal, or "active measure" domains, [below the
threshold of conflict, [trigger a military response]{.mark}]{.underline}
or are followed by the physical use of force. As noted in the discussion
on the definitions of a conflict, [the threshold]{.underline} between
crisis and military conflict [may not be explicitly]{.underline} stated
or otherwise [clear to all sides; and it may also be ignored during a
crisis]{.underline}. This aspect is especially relevant in the current
period of increased interference in the internal affairs of NATO
countries attributed to Russia and of the high volume of information
'warfare' between Russia and NATO countries.

[Russia remains vigilant about foreign interference]{.underline} in its
internal affairs and the threat of subversion leading to a severe
destabilization of the regime. In the past, Moscow has made accusations
about foreign sponsorship of Chechen and radical Islamic terrorists
targeting Russia, and has alleged the existence of training camps on the
territories of NATO states for activists planning colour revolutions in
Ukraine and Belarus. In the extreme circumstances of a crisis, [if the
Russian leadership became convinced that a non-military campaign against
it]{.underline} (which might also involve cyber activities and what
Russia calls attempts to instigate colour revolutions) [had intensified,
this could lead to a military response]{.underline}.

[With regards to NATO, some of its members' views mirror the Russian
assessment that we are already in a state of conflict,]{.underline} in
which the boundary between peace and war is blurred, and that their
defences are being actively attacked through nonmilitary means. They are
thus concerned about a scenario in which Russia initiates an attack that
moves swiftly from non-military to military means. This scenario should
be not dismissed. At the same time, one needs to be wary of interpreting
all disturbing developments as part of a grand Russian plan culminating
in a provocation or use of force. So there should be prudence before any
country presses the "panic button" at the national or NATO / European
Union level. There should also be close analysis of early warning
indicators related to the gravity, intensity and diversity of incidents
and to connections between them. The overall political context and state
of the RussiaNATO relationship would also be important: what would be
the political and strategic reasons for Russia to move from
sub-threshold to abovethreshold activities?

[Individual NATO countries would have a decisive role in how some of the
"hybrid" scenarios would play out]{.underline}. An Ally can choose to
play down or up the importance of certain developments and incidents; it
can seek NATO and/or EU support, decide to respond individually
(including through actions that are escalatory), or use a mix of both
approaches. The Ally's overall reputation and patterns of international
behaviour can matter for determining whether its "frontline"
intelligence and assessments are to be trusted. But given the danger of
alliance entrapment, NATO also needs to have multiple channels for
corroborating the evidence and assessing developments.

Escalation: Can a NATO -- Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once a conflict was under way, the "fog of war" and]{.mark} rising
[unpredictability would]{.mark} inevitably [set in,]{.mark}
[complicating]{.mark} the implementation of any predetermined theories
of escalation, [deescalation]{.mark} and]{.underline} inter-[conflict
management.]{.underline} The actual dynamics of a conflict and the
perceptions of the stakes involved are extremely difficult to predict.
Simulations and table-top exercises can give only limited insights into
the actual decisionmaking processes and interactions.

Still, Russian military theorists and practitioners seem to assume that
a conflict with NATO can be managed and controlled in a way that would
bring it to a swift end consistent with Russian aims. The Russian theory
of victory would seek to exploit weak points in an Alliance war effort.
Based on the conviction that democracies are weak and their leaders and
populations are risk-averse, Russia may assume that its threats of
horizontal or vertical escalation could be particularly effective. It
would also try to bring home the notion that it has much higher stakes
in the conflict (regime survival) than a majority of the NATO members
involved, and thus will be ready to push the boundaries of the conflict
further. It would most likely try to test and exploit potential
divisions within the Alliance, combining selective diplomacy and
activation of its intelligence assets in some NATO states with a degree
of selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

[[Any NATO-Russia conflict would]{.mark} inevitably [have a nuclear
dimension.]{.mark} The role of nuclear weapons as a tool for escalation
control for Russia has been thoroughly debated by experts]{.underline},
but when and how Russia might use (and not merely showcase or activate)
nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an open question. Beyond catch
phrases such as "escalate to de-escalate" or "escalate to win" there are
a wider range of options for Russian nuclear weapon use. For example, a
single nuclear warning shot could be lethal or non-lethal. It could be
directed against a purely military target or a military-civilian one.
Detonation could be configured for an EMP effect. A "false flag" attack
is also conceivable. These options might be used to signal escalation
and could significantly complicate NATO's responses.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the conflict to
achieve these goals, and what mechanisms and means it would use while
trying to maintain some degree of control over the conflict.

The goals and methods of waging a conflict with Russia would probably
have to be limited in order to avoid a massive nuclear exchange. Such
limitations would also involve restrictions on striking back against
targets on Russian territory. But [too narrow an approach could put too
much restraint on NATO's operations:]{.underline} the Russian regime's
stability may ultimately need to be threatened in order to force the
leadership into terminating the conflict. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

[With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance]{.underline}, with the US
taking the lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of [escalation control]{.mark} and on
lessons from the Cold War confrontation [might be
misleading]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The circumstances in which a
Russia -NATO conflict would play out would be radically different from
the 20th century screenplay. Moreover, instead of gradual (linear)
escalation or salami tactics escalation, it is possible to imagine
surprizing "leap frog" escalation, possibly connected with actions in
different domains (e.g. a cyberattack against critical infrastructure).
Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in responding to such
developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

Russian and NATO [a[ssumptions regarding conflict termination
would]{.mark} most likely [not survive the first hours of an actual
conflict. Both sides are capable of underestimating the resolve of the
other]{.mark} side to prevail in a conflict [and the other side's
willingness to commit]{.mark} the necessary [resources and
endure]{.mark} the [costs,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[especially once both
sides start committing]{.mark} their [political capital and
resources]{.mark} and the casualties accumulate]{.underline}.

With regards to Russia, Moscow would most likely be approaching the
conflict with a clearer concept of its war aims and thus develop
better-formed views on conflict termination. It would seek to establish
escalation dominance and confront NATO with a binary choice of either
accepting defeat or further intensification of fighting. Such
intensification might involve a move to the nuclear level, but Russia
would also have conventional escalation options, such as conventional
deep strikes.

At the same time, it should be highlighted that Russia is unlikely to
start a conflict which involves a high degree of uncertainty about its
final outcome and carries a risk of military defeat. Russia cannot
safely assume that US-led NATO would act with restraint, nor could it be
sure that the Alliance would be ready to surrender and terminate a
conflict early. For internal reasons Russia cannot afford to lose a "big
war", so the [[most prudent option would]{.mark} generally [be not to
initiate such a conflict]{.mark} in the first place. Such logic could,
however, get lost in some of the hybrid scenarios and scenarios of an
inadvertent outbreak of a conflict]{.underline}.

[On the NATO side, conflict termination has not been the focus of close
attention]{.underline}, as the Alliance has concentrated in recent years
on strengthening deterrence and probing the issue of defence. As one of
the workshop participants put it, "NATO is in the deterring Russia
business not in the winning a war with Russia business". This is not a
new problem. War termination proved to be a difficult subject for the
Alliance in the Cold War, as it involved delicate questions about
maintaining NATO's political cohesion and dealing with the consequences
of major nuclear exchanges. Nevertheless, NATO's ability to persevere in
a conflict should not be underestimated. Opinions that NATO would
collapse following a Russian first strike seem to be based more on
stereotypes about the weakness of Western democracies than on any
insight into how Alliances actually operate during wartime, especially
when fighting a defensive war that is perceived as just. Still, it may
be assumed that NATO would have major difficulty in setting and
implementing any conflict termination strategy based on the
intensification of military pressure on Russia, especially beyond the
immediate theatre of operations. Individual Allies, first and foremost
the US, might have to take a lead in that.

Some [[analysts paint catastrophic pictures]{.underline}]{.mark}. Robert
Kagan foresees a [return to the despotism, protectionism, and strife of
the 1930s]{.underline}, [with China and Russia reprising the roles of
imperial Japan and Nazi Germany.]{.underline} Peter Zeihan predicts [a
violent scramble for security and resources[, in which Russia
invades]{.mark} its neighbors and [East Asia descends into]{.mark} naval
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. These forecasts may be extreme, but
[they]{.underline} [reflect an essential truth]{.underline}: [[the
postwar order]{.underline}]{.mark}, although flawed and incomplete in
many ways, [has [fostered the most peaceful]{.mark} and prosperous
[period in]{.mark} human [history]{.mark}, and [its absence would make
the world]{.mark} a more [dangerous]{.mark} place]{.underline}.

[Thanks to the U.S.-led order]{.underline}, for decades, most [countries
have not had to fight for market access, guard their supply chains, or
even seriously defend their borders]{.underline}. The U.S. Navy has kept
international waterways open, the U.S. market has provided reliable
consumer demand and capital for dozens of countries, and U.S. security
guarantees have covered nearly 70 nations. [Such assurances have
benefited everyone: not just Washington's allies and partners but also
its adversaries. U.S. security guarantees had the effect of neutering
Germany and Japan, the main regional rivals of Russia and China,
respectively. In]{.underline} [turn, Moscow and Beijing could focus on
forging ties with the rest of the world rather than fighting their
historical enemies. Without U.S. patronage and protection, countries
would have to get back in the business of securing themselves and their
economic lifelines.]{.underline}

[Such a world would see the return of great-power mercantilism and new
forms of imperialism.]{.underline} [Powerful countries
would]{.underline} once again [try to reduce their economic insecurity
by establishing exclusive economic zones,]{.underline} where their firms
could enjoy cheap and secure access to raw materials and large captive
consumer markets. Today, [China is already starting to do
this]{.underline} with its Belt and Road Initiative, a network of
infrastructure projects around the world; its "Made in China 2025"
policy, to stimulate domestic production and consumption; and its
attempts to create a closed-off, parallel Internet. [If the United
States follows suit, other countries will have to attach themselves to
an American or a Chinese bloc]{.underline}---or forge blocs of their
own. [France might seek to restore its grip on its former African
colonies. Russia might accelerate its efforts to corral former Soviet
states]{.underline} into a regional trade union. [Germany increasingly
would have to look beyond Europe's shrinking populations to find buyers
for its exports]{.underline}---[and it would have to develop the
military capacity to secure those new far-flung markets and supply
lines, too.]{.underline}

As great powers competed for economic spheres, [[global governance would
erode]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Geopolitical conflict would paralyze the
UN]{.underline}, as was the case during the Cold War. [[NATO might
dissolve]{.mark} as the United States cherry-picked
partners]{.underline}. And [the unraveling of the U.S. security blanket
over Europe could mean the [end of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion,
too, which already suffers from deep divisions. The few [[arms
control]{.mark} treaties]{.underline} that remain in force today [might
fall [by the wayside]{.mark} as countries militarized to defend
themselves]{.underline}. [[Efforts to combat]{.mark} transnational
problems]{.underline}---such as [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[financial crises]{.mark}, or [pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[would
mimic]{.mark} the world's shambolic [response to
COVID]{.mark}]{.underline}-19, when countries hoarded supplies, the
World Health Organization parroted Chinese misinformation, and the
United States withdrew into itself.

The [resulting [disorder would jeopardize]{.mark}]{.underline} the very
[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark} of some states. Since 1945, [the number
of countries in the world has tripled]{.underline}, from 46 to nearly
200. [Most of these new states]{.underline}, however, [are weak and lack
energy, resources, food, domestic markets, advanced technology, military
power, or defensible borders]{.underline}. According to research by the
political scientist Arjun Chowdhury, [two-thirds of all countries today
cannot provide basic services to their people without international
hel]{.underline}p. In short, [most [countries depend critically on the
postwar order]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which has offered historically
unprecedented access to international aid, markets, shipping, and
protection]{.underline}. [[Without]{.mark} such [support]{.mark}, some
[countries would collapse]{.mark} or be conquered]{.underline}. Fragile,
aid-dependent states such as [Afghanistan, Haiti, and Liberia are only
some of the most obvious high-risk cases. Less obvious ones are capable
but trade-dependent countries such as Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and South
Korea, whose economic systems would struggle to function in a world of
closed markets and militarized sea-lanes.]{.underline}

[[Corruption of the information ecosystem has become an **existential

a part of human ecology]{.mark} and the essence of being human [as
DNA]{.mark}]{.underline} (itself a form of information!) is a part of
the evolutionary processes in biological systems.

Today, [[chaos reigns in much of the]{.underline}]{.mark} information
[[ecosystem on which societies depend]{.underline}]{.mark}. In many
forums for political and societal discourse, national [leaders shout
about fake news, by]{.underline} which they mean information they do not
like. [These same leaders lie shamelessly,]{.underline} calling their
lies truth, or perhaps "truthful hyperbole." Acting across national
boundaries, these leaders and their surrogates exacerbate existing
divisions, creating rage and diminishing confidence in elections and
democratic institutions. Using unsupported anecdotes and sketchy
rhetoric, denialists undermine well-established science about climate
change and other urgent issues. Established institutions of the
government, journalism, and education -- institutions that have
traditionally provided stability -- are under attack precisely because
they have provided stability.

The founding of the Bulletin predates by several decades the widespread
availability of computers, the Internet, smart phones, search engines,
and social media. Few could imagine in 1945 a technological environment
that affords today's high-speed and widespread connectivity, high
degrees of anonymity, insensitivity to distance and national borders,
easy and customized information searches, democratized access to
publishing capabilities, inexpensive production and consumption of
information content (including and increasingly importantly emotionally
evocative video and audio content), disintermediation of established
information sources, and ubiquitous, always-on, always-available access
to information sources through mobile devices.

Such [advances in]{.underline} information **[tech]{.underline}**nology
[have heralded the arrival of the information age]{.underline}, a world
in which taking near-immediate advantage of information opens up
enormous opportunities in both the private and public sectors for
improved delivery of existing products and services and, perhaps more
important, the creation of entirely new products and services. Products
and services can be customized to individual needs and preferences on a
large scale and at more affordable costs. Transactional friction can be
tremendously reduced. Through the Internet of Things, actuators and
sensors can be connected to process control computers to optimize the
behavior and function of physical systems. Everywhere that information
can be used to create and improve new and existing functionality (that
is, essentially everywhere), one can find or imagine new information
technologies to do so.

At the same time, [advances in]{.underline} information
**[tech]{.underline}**nology [have a dark side. The same [increases in
the volume and velocity of information]{.mark} have created a louder and
more chaotic information environment that stimulates fast, angry,
reflexive, intuitive, and visceral thinking, reaction, and action in
people and thus [displaces more complex, reflective, and rational
thought]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a chaotic environment of information
overload, people are more likely to use mental shortcuts as a way to
reduce the cognitive burden that such an environment places on their
thinking.

In recent years, we have seen how the Internet, social media, and mobile
devices (and other technologies) can be used by foreign adversaries to
interfere in elections and to disrupt the democratic process. We have
seen:

● Social media exploitation of cognitive biases to increase their impact
and reach -- short messages of 280 characters and emotionally evocative
video/ audio clips are nearly ubiquitous and much more the norm than
they ever were two decades ago.

● Disintermediation of established information sources that reduces the
role and influence of those previously responsible for providing factual
information and proliferates information sources. The US Supreme Court
noted in Associated Press v. US (1945) that "the widest possible
dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is
essential to the welfare of the public, that a free press is a condition
of a free society." Today, modern information technology has enabled the
creation of a larger number of information sources than the 1945 US
Supreme Court could possibly have imagined.

● Search engines that return highly visible results for queries based in
large part on the popularity of those results and the inferred desires
of the user for specific information rather than their actual importance
to those queries. Such functionality also makes it easier than ever for
people to find information online "by doing their own research," thus
indulging in their confirmation biases by selectively finding and
attending only to information that confirms one's beliefs. Search engine
optimization techniques enable gaming of search algorithms to promote
the visibility of false, misleading, or worthless information. ●
Many-to-many connectivity that enables the formation of echo chambers
and media bubbles that reinforce pre-existing beliefs.

● Large-scale data mining that allows adversaries to sift huge amounts
of personal data on individuals to identify and target those most
susceptible to customized, inflammatory, false, malign, or misleading
messages -- and also to keep such messages away from public view.

● Near-immediate data transfer, which enables propaganda and other
malign information to spread far and wide quickly, while efforts to
correct false information are more expensive, often fall short, and
frequently fail altogether.

● Inauthentic voices that are largely indistinguishable from authentic
ones. Macedonian entrepreneurs discovered ways to monetize an affinity
of Trump voters for fake news (Subramanian 2017). Paid human employees
of the Internet Research Agency created and spread false information on
behalf of the Russian government prior to the 2016 U.S. election
(MacFarquhar 2018). And automated "bots"--accounts purportedly
associated with human users but in fact managed entirely or mostly by
machines -- add further chaos to the information environment.

Is this state of information affairs really new? Haven't adversaries of
all stripes always employed propaganda and lies -- otherwise known as
information warfare (or at least a big part of it) -- to advance their
interests?

Yes. Information warfare indeed has a long pedigree that reaches into
the past for at least the three millennia since the Trojan Horse enabled
Greek warriors to breach the walls around the city of Troy. Much more
recently, the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany relied on propaganda.
As Hitler (1925, 155--56) wrote:

\[I\]ts purpose must be . . . to attract the attention of the masses and
not by any means to dispense individual instructions to those who
already have an educated opinion on things or who wish to form such an
opinion on grounds of objective study -- because that is not the purpose
of propaganda, it must appeal to the feelings of the public rather than
to their reasoning powers. . . . The art of propaganda consists
precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through
an appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological
form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the
national masses. . . . The receptive powers of the masses are very
restricted, and their understanding is feeble.

But [more so today than at any earlier point in human history, [human
beings are vulnerable to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation [[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}.
At the same time that [new information technologies have led to an
increase in the volume and velocity of information available on Earth by
many orders of magnitude]{.underline} in the past few decades, [the
cognitive architecture of the human mind is more or less unchanged on
the time scale of centuries or even millennia.]{.underline}

On human cognition

Research in the fields of cognitive and social psychology has formalized
what Hitler knew intuitively. We now understand that human [cognitive
processing capability is not unlimited; humans have finite cognitive
resources]{.underline} that can be "used up" under mentally stressful
circumstances. Findings from the same cognitive psychology that has
transformed neoclassical economics into behavioral economics (and
resulted in three Nobel Prizes in economics) have made clear the
"bounded rationality" of human thought and the simultaneous existence in
every individual of the capability to engage in two types of cognitive
processing.

Specifically, heuristic dual-system cognitive theory posits that [human
beings have two systems for cognitive processing]{.underline} -- an
[intuitive]{.underline}, reflexive, and emotionally driven mode of
thought (often designated as System 1) [and]{.underline} a slower, more
[deliberate]{.underline}, analytical mode of thought (often designated
as System 2). Kahneman (2011) provides a primer on System 1 and System 2
thinking. (See Petty and Cacioppo 1986; Chaiken 1987 for other variants
of dual-system cognitive theory; see Kruglanski and Thompson 1999 for a
contrary view on dual-system cognitive theory.)

System 1 is designed to operate rapidly, but it can do so because it
does not take account of all available information and is thus more
prone to error (also called bias). System 2 operates more slowly but is
more likely to take into account the available information and is less
prone to error. People engaging in System 1 information processing
respond more emotionally and less rationally or critically than in
System 2 processing.

Most important, System 1 thinking is the default mode of thought for
human beings -- it uses smaller amounts of cognitive resources, relies
on simple gutbased judgments, and is used more often when humans are
under stress. For most situations encountered in everyday life, System 1
thinking is adequate and produces mostly valid and useful outcomes, but
it often fails when a situation requires complex inferences for
understanding. For such situations, System 2 thinking, which is
effortful and consumptive of cognitive resources, is more often
appropriate -- and when individuals fail to use System 2 when it is
appropriate to do so, they are easily misled.

Most individuals are capable of both System 1 and System 2 thinking;
thus, the important operative question is the circumstances under which
they select one or the other type of thinking. Psychology has
accumulated considerable evidence relevant to this question.

For example, Taber and Lodge (2006) show that an individual tends to be
less critical of information that is favorable to his or her position
than of information that is not favorable -- that is, he or she is more
likely to engage in System 1 thinking for favorable information. People
have a confirmation bias in their information seeking and processing
behavior -- they preferentially seek out information that is consistent
with their beliefs and they are highly critical of (or ignore)
information that contradicts their beliefs. In a meta-analysis of 91
studies, Hart et al. (2009) considered two motivations for how an
individual might select information to consume -- the desire to gain an
accurate understanding of reality and the desire to feel validated in
his or her beliefs. These two motivations conflict when an accurate
understanding of reality does not validate one's beliefs, and such a
situation motivates the question of which of these motivations is more
powerful. Hart et al. concluded that both motivations drive human
informationseeking behavior, thus moderating each other to a certain
extent, but that on balance, humans do exhibit a tendency towards the
validation of their beliefs. People are also subject to belief
perseverance (a.k.a. a continuing influence effect) -- a cognitive bias
through which individuals do not revise beliefs based on erroneous
information even when they know for sure that such information is
erroneous (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).

Maintenance of an individual's social identity is an important influence
on his or her invocation of System 1 or System 2 thinking. Evidence
suggests that individuals tend to adopt the views of the peer groups
that are most salient to them, even if the "objective" or "factual"
information available to them contradicts those views. (Asch 1951
performed the classic "conformity experiments" that demonstrated this
phenomenon in the early 1950s.) Uncritical System 1 thinking is active
in processing information that is consonant with the beliefs and
attitudes of those peer groups. Critical and skeptical System 2 thinking
is active in processing information that is dissonant to those groups'
beliefs. These effects (that individuals tend to accept salient group
norms) are even more pronounced in an anonymous environment, such as
that which characterizes much online interaction (Postmes et al. 2001).

Lastly, there is evidence that [emotion and motivation affect
cognition]{.underline}. For example, people who are angry tend to rely
more heavily on simple heuristic cues (suggestive of System 1 thinking)
than those who are not angry (Bodenhausen, Sheppard, and Kramer 1994).
Individuals are more likely to stereotype people (a form of System 1
thinking) when that stereotype is consistent with their desired
impression of those people; conversely, when the stereotype is
inconsistent with their desired impression, individuals tend to inhibit
the use of this stereotype (Kunda and Sinclair 1999). Negative emotions
(such as those induced by the receipt of information incongruent with a
person's prior beliefs) can improve the ability of a person to reason
logically, thus enabling him or her to negate or discount that
information (Goel and Vartanian 2011).

[In the new]{.underline} information [environment, exploitation of human
cognitive architecture and capabilities]{.underline} -- which are
largely unchanged from what existed millennia ago -- [provides the 21st
century]{.underline} information [warrior with cyber-enabled
capabilities]{.underline} that Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels, and McCarthy
could have only imagined. By [exploiting cognitive limitations, the
perpetrators of cyber-enabled information warfare have learned to
exacerbate prejudices, biases, and ideological differences; to add heat
but no light to political discourse]{.underline}; and to spread widely
believed "alternative facts" in advancing their political positions.

Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election has dominated
news headlines ever since. But interference by authoritarian countries
in the elections of democratic states -- as undesirable and threatening
as it may be -- is hardly the only negative consequence of cyber-enabled
information warfare. The problems of nuclear war and climate change are
hard enough to solve even when well-intentioned, well-informed parties
on all sides share a basic understanding and knowledge of the relevant
facts. Yes, they may have different values and different priorities, may
act under different constraints, and be able to bring to bear different
levels of resources to these problems.

But without shared, fact-based understandings of the blast, thermal, and
radiation effects of nuclear explosions, what hope is there for national
leaders to reach agreements to reduce the threat of nuclear holocaust
\[war\] or to make good decisions about nuclear weapons use in times of
crisis? Without shared, fact-based understandings that rising
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations caused by human beings result
in corresponding increases in global temperature and climatic
disruption, what hope is there for national leaders to reach agreements
to begin serious efforts at decarbonizing their economies?

Climate change denialism

Climate change denialism can be fairly characterized as cyber-enabled
information warfare against the reality of large-scale
anthropogenically-induced climate change. In the responses of people
resistant to taking action to mitigate climate change, we see a number
of psychological factors at work (Zaval and Cornwell 2016). For example,
one key element of System 1 thinking is the availability heuristic, with
which individuals tend to associate the likelihood of an event with the
ease with which they can remember similar events in the past. But the
long-term consequences of climate change are unprecedented in recorded
human history and obviously people have no personal memories of
unprecedented events.

Moreover, climate change is a long-term process whose inexorable
progression is easily masked by short-term fluctuations in local weather
conditions. For example, public concerns about climate changes correlate
with local weather conditions (Krosnick et al. 2006). Climate change
deniers are also quick to flag for public attention days that are
particularly cold as "evidence" that global warming is not occurring and
thus, they claim, discrediting theories of climate change. This
illustrates a bias known as attribute substitution, as Kahneman and
Frederick (2002) describe, through which individuals substitute salient
information (such as the cold temperature today) for information that is
more relevant but harder to understand (such as information about global
climate change).

People are also subject to a loss-aversion bias, in which they place
greater weight on losses than gains of equal value. In 1992, the United
States committed itself to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, although President George HW Bush also stated that "the
American way of life is not up for negotiation" -- and in 2018, the
United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement (which was based on the
convention). The argument? That the United States would have to give up
too much if it kept to the agreement.

To close this (merely illustrative) exploration of biases relevant to
climate change denialism, the optimism bias suggests that people
consider themselves exceptions when considering the likelihood of a
negative event occurring. That is, bad things may happen to other
people, but they won't happen to me, even though I and those other
people are similar in important and relevant ways. In a climate context,
the bad things may involve sea level rise or heat waves -- and the
misperception that "others may suffer from such problems but I won't"
diminishes the power of personal concern as a driver for rational
decision making.

Connecting the operation of these cognitive biases to the affordances of
modern information technologies is not difficult. For example, Roxburgh
et al. (2019) demonstrate how the characteristics of specific weather
events (e.g. hurricanes or snowstorms) and "short-term socio-political
context can play a critical role in determining the lenses through which
climate change is viewed." Note especially the importance of "short-term
socio-political context" -- precisely the context that social media
shapes.

Elsasser and Dunlap (2013) noted the influential role of a variety of
newspaper columnists in advancing denialist arguments and thus
amplifying these arguments to a broad segment of the American public.
Fewer in number then, essentially all columnists today (of all political
leanings) have a social media presence that they use to publicize their
work, and in many instances their online presence is driven in
significant part by social media and reach many more readers online than
in print. Furthermore, subtleties and nuances in their extended written
pieces are likely to be lost when they are represented in social media.

Another important element of climate change denialism is the easy
accessibility of seemingly-authoritative information that casts doubt on
the well-established science of climate change. As reported by The
Guardian, a variety of largely secret funding sources distributed \$118
million to 102 denialist organizations (Goldenberg 2013). Oreskes and
Conway (2011) provide the definitive work on deliberate information
campaigns to obscure the scientific truth on a range of issues from
smoking to climate change. These denialist organizations have generated
a variety of products for public and policy consumption (but --
unsurprisingly -- not many peer-reviewed scientific articles) that are
easily accessible to the public, mainstream media outlets, and policy
makers. Their products are broadly disseminated through social media and
easily found through customized search, and they are sought by reporters
who seeking to cover "both sides" of a controversy that is
intellectually equivalent to a "controversy" about whether the earth is
round or flat.

Nuclear conflict

On the risks of nuclear conflict, theories and approaches to nuclear
deterrence and strategic stability developed prior to the collapse of
the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and early 1990's rest on the
presumption of rationality in national decision makers. In particular,
they assume that adversaries are deterred from attacking by a threat of
retaliation that would impose costs on the adversary that would outweigh
any conceivable benefits that it would gain from an attack (Morgan
2003). Central to this assumption is a rational adversary that can and
does make a calculation of expected costs and benefits, compares them,
and then acts accordingly.

But the psychologically informed understanding of realworld decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us is that the
rationality assumption at the base of much traditional thinking on
deterrence and strategic stability is untenable, given that humans have
evolved to rely on intuitive, reflexive, heuristic System 1 thinking to
make decisions, particularly when faced with time pressures, surprise
and other obstacles to the deliberate calculation implied by System 2
thinking (Kahneman 2011). Psychology tells us that -- more often than
not -- the fast, intuitive judgements of System 1 often take precedence
over the slower, more analytical thinking of System 2.

The challenges posed by reflexive reliance on System 1 thinking are
greatly accentuated by characteristics of today's information
environment. Social media networks in particular are optimally designed
to stimulate System 1 thinking -- emotional, reflexive, immediate -- and
they rapidly transmit content among like-minded individuals, creating
the ideal conditions for public polarization and divisiveness to occur
(Pfeffer, Zorbach, and Carley 2014). Multiple narratives rapidly emerge
around complex events; citizens splinter into their own informational
universes and are unable to agree on an underlying reality. Political
leaders themselves are subject to these conflicting narratives and may
even be active and influential participants in one or another of them.

It is thus easy to posit that in this information environment,
manipulated information -- either artificially constructed or adopted by
a strong grassroots base -- could be used by interested parties to
generate pressure on leaders to act. At the same time, leaders
themselves are likely to be facing information overload and less able to
distinguish analyzed information from their own intelligence sources and
other, unvetted information originating from their constituencies.

The coming information dystopia

Nuclear war and climate change are arguably the most important
existential challenges today that are compounded by the corruption of
the information ecosystem. But [even if a single miraculous stroke the
laws of physics were changed to make nuclear weapons impossible to build
and operate and to immediately eliminate anthropogenic emissions at zero
cost, cyber-enabled information warfare could still can lead to an
information dystopia]{.underline}. Here are some possible elements:

● Adversaries manufacture numerous graphic videos of American soldiers
(complete with sound effects) committing battlefield atrocities, and
spread them widely through the Internet. Once upon a time, highquality
video forgeries were difficult and expensive to make. AI-based
technologies will bring this socalled deepfake capability to the masses,
and anyone with imagination, a modicum of technical skill, and a
personal computer will be able to distribute reasonably realistic
forgeries. Denials will be issued but of course will also not be
believed by large fractions of viewers. Even if proof of inauthenticity
can be provided, such evidence will not affect the responses of many
viewers.

● Political campaigns conduct similar efforts to discredit political
opponents (e.g. "showing" an opponent making controversial or
disqualifying remarks before an election). But they also use the
existence of deepfake technologies to deflect attention from authentic
and real evidence of their own political and personal misdeeds. For
example, a real video of a candidate punching an old lady who supports
his opponent will be dismissed as "one of those deepfakes that anyone
could have produced."

● Financial markets are disrupted by falsified videos of CEOs making
announcements regarding company prospects that are much more pessimistic
than expected. Attempts to correct the record are drowned out in a
subsequent flood of contradictory information, all of which appear at
first glance to be authentic.

● Public safety is compromised by reports of local disasters (e.g.
explosions of chemical plants that result in the release large amounts
of toxic gases). These reports, along with "authentic" video of people
choking amidst locally familiar locations (e.g. well-known fields or
sport stadiums), cause spontaneous mass evacuations. Contradictory
directions for evacuation broadcast using social media result in chaos
on the streets and highways.

● Public health is placed at risk when the safety and efficacy of
medical treatments known to be safe and effective are publicly
questioned through active disinformation campaigns conducted on the
Internet and in bookstores. Attempts to provide valid information are
met with responses such as "that's what the pharmaceutical companies and
medical establishment want you to think, but just look at what's
happened to our children."

● Children in schools are threatened by online campaigns to spread
rumor, innuendo, and positive or negative information about various
students. Conducting such campaigns for pay becomes the business model
of entrepreneurs who advertise that they can guarantee admission to
selective colleges, boost the social standing of the children of their
clients, or take revenge on those who have harmed such children, all in
anonymous and untraceable ways.

● Journalists, political leaders, and judges are compromised by artfully
forged emails and alterations to other documents that are mixed with
entirely authentic leaked emails and documents and are indistinguishable
from them.

[A world with these elements]{.underline} -- and many more comparable
ones -- [will be the inevitable result if and when deployment and use of
the tools of cyber-enabled]{.underline} information [warfare become
widespread]{.underline}. And even more troubling is the fact that not
every bit of information needs to be corrupted for this dystopian
outcome to occur -- it will require only a fraction of it to be
corrupted for people to lose faith entirely in "objective" and
"trustworthy" sources of information, the result of which will be that
people will fractionate into their own information realities.

Fearing the end of the enlightenment

The Enlightenment established reason and reality as the foundational
pillars of civilized discourse. In such discourse, logic matters, and a
logical contradiction between statement A and statement B means that at
least one of those statements is false. The truth of a statement about
the world is tested by its correspondence to objective reality rather
than by how many people believe it; that is, empirical data are
influential. Furthermore, statements known to be wrong or false do not
affect conclusions or choices between alternative courses of action.

[[Cyber-enabled]{.underline} **[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation
[[warfare provides the tactics]{.mark}, tools, and
procedures]{.underline} -- in short, the means -- [[to replace]{.mark}

corruption of the information ecosystem could be seen as an analog of
poisoning water suppli]{.underline}es that can be done remotely,
inexpensively, and anonymously. All of this is just another way of

[NATO's success as a collective defense organization lies in its ability

of any one of them. [[**Cohesion** is what makes the alliance
**strong**]{.underline}]{.mark} and unique, [but it is difficult to
sustain]{.underline} day after day, under constant pressure from
adversaries.

One useful way to measure cohesion is in financial terms. Despite a
pledge to contribute the equivalent of at least 2 percent of their gross
domestic product to defense by 2024, some member states seem likely to
miss the target. While this does not prove that the allies disagree on
the nature and gravity of the threats before them, it does strongly
suggest that some have not fully bought into the agreed priorities.

[[Many factors are undermining cohesion in NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
an era with no single unifying threat, different [members inevitably
have different interests]{.underline} in diverse centers of power and
influence. Allies also diverge on what constitute democratic standards
and appropriate responses to competition with non-Western actors.1

[It is up to individual countries]{.underline} to safeguard their
freedom to respond to a call for help from an ally, address
vulnerabilities and gaps in their national systems, and take proactive
measures to reduce risks. [But [t]{.mark}he [alliance]{.mark} as an
organization [can help]{.mark}. [This is especially true when it comes
to understanding and responding to new threats to cohesion. None is more
relevant than the hybrid war]{.mark}]{.underline} for hearts and minds
that NATO's adversaries are waging through political interference and
disinformation.

ISSUES AT STAKE

While not a new phenomenon, hybrid warfare has been widely mentioned in
international discourse since at least 2014. The Russian military
intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea showed that NATO and
its member states lacked ready-made responses to the emergence of a
threat aimed directly at solidarity and cohesion. The experience has
prompted allies to rethink, act, and adapt quickly, especially with
regard to instruments for protection beyond triggering Article 5 of
NATO's founding treaty, which declares that an attack on one ally is an
attack on all.

Hybrid warfare includes a variety of activities and covers the use of
different instruments to destabilize a society by influencing its
decisionmaking. [Frequent instruments include]{.underline}:

[Interference in electoral processes]{.underline}: An adversary can use
techniques from campaigning through the media and social networks to
securing financial resources for a political group to influence the
outcome of an election in a direction that favors the adversary's
political interests.

[Disinformation and false news]{.underline}: An adversary can create a
parallel reality and use falsehoods to fuel social fragmentation. The
idea is to disorient the public and make it difficult for a government
to seek public approval for a given NATO policy or operation.

[Cyber attacks]{.underline}: An adversary can pressure NATO governments
into not coming to each other's aid in times of crisis by threatening
devastating cyber attacks aimed at the civilian population. Examples
include attacks on networks governing hospitals or electricity and water
supplies.2

[Drone attacks:]{.underline} These are similar to cyber attacks but on a
more limited scale. An adversary can use remotely piloted platforms to
inflict misery on civilians by crippling the operations of airports, air
ambulances, and police helicopters. Such attacks can also hamper
military airspace operations in early phases of a conflict.3

[Financial influence]{.underline}: An adversary can make investments,
conclude unfavorable energy-supply deals, or offer loans that make a
country vulnerable in the long run to political pressure.

Russia is the most frequently cited source of hybrid attacks,
particularly disinformation, interference in elections, and cyber
attacks.4 It and other states often act via third, nonstate entities
such as nationalist, criminal, or terrorist groups. This leaves the
attacking state room for deniability, confuses the attacked country, and
can prevent a timely and adequate response. Most hybrid operations to
date have featured a mixture of mechanisms used by state and nonstate
actors, and a clear line between them is difficult to draw.

NATO's efforts to address hybrid threats have been conducted at two
levels: defining strategy at the supranational level and assisting the
target countries at the national level. The latter effort will receive a
boost when the new counterhybrid support teams on which members agreed
in July 2018 fully come into effect. NATO's Joint Intelligence and
Security Division is in charge of hybrid-related research and analysis,
while the Public Diplomacy Division tracks disinformation through online
instruments. The Emerging Security Challenges Working Group, established
in 2012, has a goal to identify and prioritize nontraditional threats.

Because hybrid attacks are a threat to the West as a whole, not just
NATO, and because they mostly rely on nonmilitary tools, the alliance
has been strengthening its cooperation with the European Union (EU). One
useful tool available to both organizations is the joint European Center
of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, established in Helsinki in
April 2017.

RECOMMENDATIONS

[[NATO]{.mark} can and [should do more to counter hybrid
threats,]{.mark}]{.underline} following the proven strategy of prepare,
deter, and defend.5

BUILD RESILIENCE BY FOSTERING DEMOCRACY

[The [first]{.mark}, self-evident recommendation is to [deny adversaries
the opportunities they exploit for hybrid attacks. The more stable the
political systems]{.mark} and economies of NATO countries are, [the less
suitable ground they represent for hybrid
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A government that is credible,
popular, and trusted will have an easier time winning support for its
chosen course of action in NATO than other governments and will be
better able to resist disinformation and other forms of interference and
blackmail.6

Western Balkan countries seem particularly vulnerable, as their citizens
tend to have low trust in the authorities and do not believe that their
judiciaries are truly independent. In opinion polls, as many as 70
percent of respondents said that the law did not equally apply to all.7
Democracy and trust have declined in most Western Balkan countries over
the last ten years, a trend that overlaps with the crisis of democracy
throughout Europe.8

[[Steps that strengthen democracy and economies are the most effective
way of building resilience against hybrid attacks]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Corruption deserves particular attention. Not all authoritarian and
illiberal governments are corrupt, but most abuse access to public and
European funds to give themselves a competitive advantage over political
rivals.9 [Once on a corrupt path, authoritarians are, in essence,
condemned to always seek to remain in power, lest they be prosecuted.
[It is a vicious circle, and this dynamic between authoritarianism and
corruption is not always understood]{.mark}]{.underline}---including by
the U.S. and EU leaderships, [which does not serve the alliance
well.]{.underline}

#### F---[Cooperative action]{.underline} on [resilience]{.underline} approaches is [critical]{.underline}

Indeed, traditional security concerns, such as nuclear weapons and
conventional defense and deterrence, will not go away for the
transatlantic community. Yet, [going forward, [transatlantic]{.mark}
nations and [institutions will]{.mark} increasingly [need to focus on
hybrid]{.mark}]{.underline} and nontraditional [[threats]{.underline}
t]{.mark}oo.2 [[This is particularly underscored by]{.underline}]{.mark}
the 2020 [[coronavirus]{.underline}]{.mark} crisis, [[in which both
Russia and China have played]{.underline}]{.mark} various
[[roles]{.underline}. [Both]{.underline}]{.mark} China and Russia
[[capitalized]{.mark} on the crisis [to wage disinformation
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline} against the West. [They promulgated
conspiracy theories]{.underline} designed to sow fear about America's
handling of the outbreak and t[o promote the successes of their own
authoritarian regimes. Moscow and Beijing also strategically delivered
aid and medical supplie]{.underline}s to European countries in attempts
[to build good will and clout]{.underline} on the international stage.
[[These issues cannot be]{.mark} effectively [addressed alone]{.mark} or
in a vacuum, [making]{.mark} global cooperation and [collective
action--especially among transatlantic
allies---**paramount**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even as transatlantic
nations and institutions shift priorities]{.underline} in the wake of
the coronavirus crisis, [[key counter-hybrid priorities, such as
building resilience,]{.mark}]{.underline} strengthening civil response
capacities, and investing in civic education, [simultaneously [serve
priorities]{.mark} for pandemic prevention and response. [This
is]{.mark} all [the]{.mark} more [reason to **prioritize** the
counter-hybrid agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Cyber Threat Landscape

[NATO defines cyberspace as the "global domain consisting of all
interconnected communication, information technology and other
electronic systems]{.underline}, networks and their data, including
those which are separated or independent, which process, store or
transmit data."13 The domain thus has three main components: (1) the
physical layer, such as hardware components or undersea cables that are
geographically bound; (2) the logical layer, where elements are
manifested in code or data through software, firmware, etc.; and (3) the
human layer, consisting of the virtual identities of those individuals
interacting with the other layers.14

[Cyberspace operations are operations to defend, attack, or exploit
computers, their information, and/or networks. Defensive operations look
to maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of
computers, information, and networks. Offensive operations seek to
disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information, computers, and/or
networks.]{.underline} Operations focused on exploitation intend to
monitor, collect, and exfiltrate data from computers and networks
without disruption or destruction.15 To a certain degree, operations are
dependent on physical infrastructure that supports and enables the
digital realm, and they can produce territorial effects. Yet, [[cyber
operations]{.mark} are not territorially bound; they [can produce
near-instantaneous effects that]{.mark}, whether intended or not, can
[rapidly spread to]{.mark} networks and [systems outside the original
target.]{.mark}]{.underline} Targeting itself is not limited to state
assets, as the private sector is routinely the victim of malicious
activity.

Both state and non-state actors can conduct cyberspace operations.

[[Non-state actors can include individuals, criminal organizations,
terrorist groups, and 'patriotic hackers']{.underline}]{.mark} (some of
which can be state-affil- iated or state-sanctioned). [[State
actors]{.mark} primarily [include intelligence services and]{.mark}
militaries]{.underline}. Operations carried out by states are likely to
be more impactful as they are better-financed and better-resourced than
non-state actors. While a variety of states can and do make use of cyber
operations, NATO Allies emphasized Russia and China as primary threat
actors at the 2021 Brussels Summit.16

[[There are three main ways adversaries can utilize cyber]{.mark}
operations]{.underline}.17 First, [[cyber operations can achieve
independent effects in or through the cyber domain.]{.mark}
S]{.underline}uch operations range from relatively unsophisticated
attacks, such as distributed denials of service (DDOS), to the complex
deployment of malware by advanced persistent threats (APTs). For
example, the 2007 DDOS attacks on Estonia used fairly simple methods to
send traffic requests that overwhelmed servers used by the Estonian
Parliament, several political parties, institutions in control of the
country's internet infrastructure, and a number of financial firms, news
organizations, and communications firms.18 More complex methods were
used to produce significant physical damage in the suspected
Russian-sponsored compromise of a German steel mill in 2014, in which
spear-phishing emails contained malicious attachments that, once opened,
accessed and disrupted the industrial controls systems for a blast
furnace.19

Second, [[cyberspace operations can act as a military force multiplier.
Adversaries can use cyber tools to 'prepare the battlefield']{.mark} by
compromising a target's communications system]{.underline}s, as was the
case for the 2008 Russian incursion into Georgia. As the Russian
military prepared for a ground invasion, a variety of Russian-linked
non-state actors, including criminal organizations, conducted a series
of DDOS attacks that degraded the Georgian government's communications
systems and froze the National Bank of Georgia. The Russian military
invasion benefited greatly, as Georgia was unable to coordinate defense
efforts and was delayed in procuring war materials from the private
sector.20 [[Cyber operations can also be a force multiplier when used in
conjunction with traditional military]{.mark} means]{.underline}. For
example, Russia's invasion and illegal occupation of Crimea has
co-deployed cyber tools with kinetic weapons systems in attempts to
bolster the Russian military's effects.21

Finally, [[attacks and exploitation in and through cyberspace can enable
broader grey zone operations]{.underline}]{.mark}22 [s[uch]{.mark} as
[defense industrial espionage and]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**ntellectual
**[p]{.mark}**roperty [theft, compromising critical infrastructure,
election meddling, and broader disinformation
effort]{.mark}s]{.underline} (see Rebegea and Schmiedl in this volume).
Notable examples include cyber operations such as China's theft of F-35
fighter jet design plans from US defense contractor Lockheed Martin in
2009, Russian infiltration of US power grids in 2009, the 2013 Chinese
hack of the US Office of Personnel Management, and Russian election
meddling in US and European elections

Introduction

[What the war in Ukraine says about cyber power is yet not entirely
cleared from the fog of war]{.underline}. Many aspects remain uncertain,
but given the unpredictability of the Putin regime, the risk of an
escalation in hostile cyber exchanges between Russia and NATO states
remains high. [What is clear is that, as of February 24, 2022, [we live
in a different world in which the European and global security orders
have been shattered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This brief first explores the challenge that cyber threats pose to NATO
allies and how the rapidly evolving cyber-threat landscape can alter the
inter- national security environment. Secondly, it looks at developments
in cyber defense policy within NATO. Finally, the brief analyzes how
NATO needs to adapt to address cyber challenges, studying how allies
align their sovereign interests, capabilities, and cyber doctrines with
NATO operational requirements and strategic ambitions. NATO is set to
issue strategic documents in 2022 that will guide the next decade of its
military planning. This will certainly require more transatlantic
consultation on political-military matters with an emphasis on cyber
security and cyber defense.

The Cyber Challenge to the World and NATO Allies

[[Malicious cyber activity has increased
substantially]{.mark}]{.underline} over the past years while the world
has kept turning amid the omnipresent pandemic and now war in Ukraine.
[[States, non-state actors, and criminal groups compete and are
increasingly weaponizing sensitive information and infiltrating other
countries' networks]{.mark} to steal data, seed misinformation, or
disrupt critical infrastructure.]{.underline}

The coronavirus [[pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat
landscape]{.underline}]{.mark}. In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the
spread of the coronavirus led to social distancing measures, travel
restrictions, and remote work. In a short span of time, IT security
profes- sionals had to respond to the challenges of working from home,
such as enterprise data movements when employees accessed cloud-based
apps via their home internet, corporate software, videoconferencing, and
file sharing.1 Even if hardware and software solutions were in place to
secure the organization's data, there were often no established policies
to help employees wade through the jungle of threats and vulnerabilities
they faced when moving their workplace out of the traditional office
environment.2

According to the FireEye Mandiant Special Report: M-Trends 2021, the
[top five most targeted indus- tries in 2020 were business and
professional services, retail and hospitality, finance, healthcare, and
high technology.]{.underline} The [main methods used were extortion,
ransom demands, payment card theft, and illicit trans- fers.
D]{.underline}irect financial gain was the likely motive for 36% of
intrusions, and an additional 2% of intrusions were likely perpetrated
to resell access. In 2021, data theft remained an important mission
objective for threat actors; in 32% of intrusions, adversaries stole
data.3

[Currently, [highly organized, technically proficient criminal
syndicates comprise the most significant cyber threat to
allie]{.mark}s]{.underline}. These groups try to steal data or extort
money through ransomware. In 2021, promi- nent ransomware attacks struck
Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the largest fuel pipeline on the East
Coast of the United States; JBS, the largest meat processing company in
North America; and Coop, a major supermarket chain in Sweden. Healthcare
was also targeted---in May of the same year, the entire health service
system of Ireland was disrupted for weeks, and over the spring and
summer, dozens of hospitals in Europe and the United States were locked
out of life-critical systems by ransomware attacks.4

[[Another set of threats comes in the form of bellig- erent
state]{.mark} actors that seek to steal sensitive data for
espionage]{.underline}. In December 2020, Russian intelligence services
infiltrated the digital systems run by US tech firm SolarWinds and
inserted malware into its code. During the company's next software
update, the virus was inadvertently spread to about 18,000 clients,
including large corporations, the Pentagon, the State Department,
Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US government agencies. The
hack went unde- tected for months before the victims discovered vast
amounts of their data had been stolen.5

There are [[also politically motivated cyberattacks mandated by states
that interfere in democratic processes]{.mark} and political
discourse]{.underline}. In September 2020, the internal email system of
Norway's parliament was hacked.6 Ine Eriksen Søreide, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs of Norway, underlined the significance of the attack by
calling it an important cyber incident that affected the "most important
democratic institution" of the country.7 Norwegian authorities later
identified Russia as the actor responsible for the attack, marking the
first time that Norwegian authorities had made a political attribution
to such an attack.

Since the beginning of this year, [[Ukraine's govern- ment has been hit
by a series of cyberattacks]{.mark} that defaced government websites and
wiped out the data on some government computers]{.underline}. In
mid-Jan- uary, hackers defaced about 70 Ukrainian websites, including
the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defense, Energy, Education, and
Science, as well as the State Emergency Service and the Ministry of
Digital Trans- formation, whose e-governance portal gives the Ukrainian
public digital access to dozens of govern- ment services. The hackers
replaced the home pages of about a dozen sites with a threatening
message: "be afraid and expect worse." After a couple of days,however,
most of the sites were restored.8 The [inter- national hacktivist
collective Anonymous has declared "cyberwar" against Russia's
government, claiming credit for several cyber incidents]{.underline}
including distrib- uted denial of service attacks that took down Russian
government websites and Russia Today, the state- backed news service.9

Around the globe, [[aging critical infrastructure has long been
vulnerable]{.mark} to attack.]{.underline}

The [[most worrying type of cyberattack is sophis- ticated
malware]{.mark} designed by states or state-backed actors [that act as
"time bombs" in the critical cyber networks]{.mark} of target countries,
such as the energy, telecom, and transportation sectors]{.underline}.
Around the globe, aging critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable
to attack. In 2020, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a
warning of Russian attacks on millions of routers, firewalls, and
devices used by infrastruc- ture operators and government agencies.10

On the day of the Russian invasion, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed
satellite broadband services, was hacked along with one of its
satellites Ka-Sat, whose users included Ukraine's armed forces, police,
and intelligence service. [Destructive wiper malware attacks by Russia
against Ukraine]{.underline} included Whisper- Gate, discovered in
January by Microsoft, in Ukraine's networks that "provide critical
executive branch or emergency response functions";11 HermeticWizard and
IsaacWiper,12 [targeting multiple Ukrainian orga- nizations just hours
before the Russian invasion began]{.underline}; and CaddyWiper, spotted
by researchers at the Slovak internet security company ESET in
mid-March.13 [All of them were designed to wipe or overwrite critical
files on infected systems and leave computer hard drives corrupted and
unrecoverable.]{.underline} These incidents demonstrate that, in the
words of cyber expert and Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank
chairman Dmitri Alperovich, ["[Cyberattacks have become a theater for
great-power conflict in which governments and militaries fight in the
hybrid 'gray zone]{.mark},']{.underline} where the boundaries between
peace and war are blurred."14 The actors navigate a complex web of
ambiguous and deeply interconnected challenges, where [[cyberattacks are
not a separate front, but rather an extension of the
conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Cyber Impact: Nuclear Entanglement

#### \[x\] Cyberattacks risk nuclear escalation---C3I entanglement

Note: C3I = command, control, communications, and intelligence

Summary

 [[NATO's nuclear capability]{.mark} is provided by the US and the
UK]{.underline}. The [modernization]{.underline} of systems and arsenals
held by both states is proceeding apace. This [[has
involved]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and continues to involve -- the
[integration and [use of increasingly sophisticated]{.mark} new
**[tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline} within their nuclear programmes,
including in their respective command, control and communication (C3)
systems.

 [[Cyber operations targeting]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO members' [[C3
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} and their assets, including nuclear assets,
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[increasingly
sophisticated]{.underline}]{.mark} in nature. While cybersecurity is a
serious concern, and there is acknowledgment of the potential magnitude
of cyberattacks, documentation available in the public domain indicates
the need for NATO and its members to put in place further measures to
ensure the cybersecurity of C3 systems, including those of nuclear
systems (NC3). This is all the more pertinent given that some [Allies'
military capabilities still include legacy systems from]{.underline}
[the Soviet era.]{.underline}

 The [[protection of C3 systems requires]{.underline}]{.mark} the
adoption of adequate, adaptable and [[robust cybersecurity]{.mark}
measures]{.underline}, in order [[to ensure]{.mark} the
[integrity]{.mark} of these systems [and]{.mark} to [shield]{.mark} them
[from]{.mark} both internal and external
[disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}. The following five considerations are
of relevance for the protection of NATO's own C3 systems, and those of
its member states: software and network protection; data (integrity)
protection; hardware protection; access/security controls; and
cybersecurity awareness/security by design. These attest to the need for
robust measures beyond the non-kinetic, digital realm to ensure the
cybersecurity of NATO's C3 ecosystem.

 The [[increasing reliance on C3 assets]{.underline} [that may be used
for both conventional and nuclear operations raises the prospect of
entanglement,]{.underline} [and the associated risk of rapid
escalation]{.underline}. [The potential for unintended escalation is
further exacerbated by the threat of cyberattacks]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and possible new threats emanating from other emerging technologies,
including quantum computing.]{.underline} Unknown and unanticipated
effects from cyber operations targeted at C3 assets may compromise the
legality of these attacks when such assets may be of both military and
civilian use simultaneously.

 [Measures to prevent misinterpretation and rapid escalation are
critical to the security of C3 systems]{.underline}. Such measures could
include a clearer understanding of: how adversaries think about command
and control; what would constitute a cyberattack in the context of C3
systems; and what would constitute adequate responses to such attacks
within the frameworks of international law -- particularly international
humanitarian law.

 [False confidence and false stress are equally problematic. In
addition to ensuring]{.underline} the [cybersecurity]{.underline} of
their existing nuclear planning and NC3 architecture[, NATO and Allies
must reflect on how these dynamics will affect current understanding,
arrangements and strategies surrounding the concept of nuclear
sharing]{.underline}. Concerns over legacy infrastructure, in the
context of an evolving threat landscape and the modernization of systems
with digital means, raise questions with regard to the way forward for
the hosting of US nuclear weapons in Europe, as well as for existing
nuclear burden sharing agreements.

### Cyber Impact: Nuclear Escalation

#### Tit-for-tat retaliation spirals risk nuclear escalation

accessed 2-24-22\]

[The danger]{.underline} here [is that economic [attacks of this
sort]{.mark}]{.underline}, if undertaken during a period of tension and
crisis, [[could lead to an escalating series of tit-for-tat
attacks]{.mark} against ever more vital elements of an adversary's
critical infrastructure, [producing widespread
chaos]{.mark}]{.underline} and harm [[and eventually leading one side to
initiate kinetic attacks]{.mark} on critical military targets, [risking
the slippery slope to nuclear conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline} For
example, a [Russian cyberattack on the U.S. power grid could trigger
U.S. attacks on Russian energy and financial systems, causing widespread
disorder in both countries and generating an impulse for even more
devastating attacks.]{.underline} At some point, [[such attacks "could
lead to major conflict and possibly nuclear war]{.underline}."14]{.mark}

[These are by no means the only pathways to escalation resulting from
the offensive use of cyberweapons. Others include efforts by third
parties, such as proxy states or terrorist organizations, to provoke a
global nuclear crisis by causing early-warning systems to generate false
readings]{.underline} ("spoofing") of missile launches. Yet, they do
provide a clear indication of the severity of the threat. As states'
reliance on cyberspace grows and cyberweapons become more powerful, the
dangers of unintended or accidental escalation can only grow more
severe.

#### Use-or-lose incentives risk nuclear escalation

Although occurring largely in secret, what can aptly be called "[[an
arms race in cyberspace" is underway]{.underline}]{.mark}. Where this
might lead is difficult to foresee, but [[it is certain to involve the
development of ever more potent cyberweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. Each
nuclear power will seek to enhance its defenses against future
cyberattack. Yet, just as is the case in missile warfare, [[it is easier
and cheaper to devise new offensive cybersystems than defensive
ones]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the event of a crisis, then, [[there will
be a strong temptation to employ the new technologies
early]{.underline}]{.mark} in the encounter, when they might be used to
maximum effect, [[setting in motion an escalatory process resulting in
nuclear weapons use]{.underline}]{.mark}. As noted, the mere fact that
disruptive malware is known to have been embedded in the vital
command-and-control systems of a nuclear power could lead it to distrust
its early-warning and intelligence systems and, in a panicky response to
ambiguous signals, assume the worst and launch its nuclear weapons.

#### Cyber attacks cause massive destruction and risk nuclear retaliation

Administration and Distinguished Senior Fellow, James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies, "Cyber Offense and a Changing Strategic
Paradigm," WASHINGTON QUARTERLY v. 45 n. 1, Spring 2022, p. 39-40\]

This reorientation might seem a positive development by possibly
lowering the threat of nuclear conflict. But this optimistic conclusion
is not clear-cut. To be sure, the destruction from massive cyberattacks
against critical infrastructure would be orders of magnitude less than
that caused by nuclear war. It is also true that calibrated
infrastructure cyberattacks provide additional pre-nuclear rungs to the
escalation ladder, possibly making resort to nuclear arms more remote.6
[Massive [infrastructure cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, however,
[could]{.underline} nonetheless [[cause catastrophic devastation,
leading to]{.mark} years]{.underline} of national [hardship and
[considerable loss of life from the collapse of]{.mark} food, water,
medical, and other [essential systems]{.mark}]{.underline}[.7]{.mark}
Moreover, [the [very fact that such]{.mark} infrastructure [attacks
avoid the unbounded cataclysm of nuclear war increases the likelihood
that this cyber capability could be used]{.mark}]{.underline},
potentially to the great harm of the targeted state. [[Nor can the
threat of retaliation with nuclear arms to an unrestrained cyberattack
be ruled out, a possibility the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, at least, [[appeared to
invoke]{.underline}]{.mark} in the US 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. 8
[[China and Russia have also implicitly left the door open to responding
with nuclear weapons]{.mark} to such an attack]{.underline}.9

#### There are multiple nuclear escalation pathways---spoofing, use-or-lose pressures, escalation spirals

Administration and Distinguished Senior Fellow, James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies, "Cyber Offense and a Changing Strategic
Paradigm," WASHINGTON QUARTERLY v. 45 n. 1, Spring 2022, p. 38-39\]

Many in the national security community fear that such [[cyber
operations carry the potential for]{.mark} dangerous, [unpredictable
consequences]{.mark}. High on the list of concerns is that offensive
[cyber tools intended for use against nuclear weapon systems will create
uncertainties in potential target countries regarding the integrity of
their second-strike nuclear forces. This]{.mark}]{.underline}, it is
feared, [[could create incentives to strike first]{.mark} in a crisis,
eroding strategic stability]{.underline} based on certainty of
devastating retaliation in kind to a nuclear attack. A related oft-noted
worry is that an adversary's or non-state actor's [[cyber tampering
with]{.mark} a state's [early warning systems could lead the latter to
launch its nuclear forces based on spurious information indicating it
was under attack]{.mark}]{.underline}, or on the erroneous assumption
that the tampering, which may have in fact been undertaken only to
collect intelligence or to interfere with conventional military
operations, was precursor to such an attack.3 In the case of a
cyberattack against a state's critical infrastructure, a leading concern
is that [the [state's response to]{.mark} such [attacks cannot be known
in advance, but could set in motion a volatile escalatory spiral,
leading to]{.mark} conventional conflict and ultimately possible [resort
to nuclear arms]{.mark}]{.underline}.4

accessed 2-24-22\]

It isn\'t hard to see why [[NATO is worried about]{.underline}]{.mark}
threats in [[cyberspace, given Russia\'s recent use]{.underline}]{.mark}
of on-line attacks against Ukraine and other countries in a style of
combat that has come to be called \"hybrid warfare.\" However, a report
by the Pentagon\'s prestigious Defense Science Board released last year
suggests that the cyber challenge reaches far beyond the use of botnets
and distributed denial-of-service tactics. Describing the extensive
vulnerability of U.S. military forces to cyber assault, the report then
observed,

The [[impact of a]{.underline}]{.mark} destructive [[cyber
attack]{.underline}]{.mark} on the civilian population [[would
be]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[greater with no electricity, money,
communications, TV, radio or fuel]{.underline}]{.mark} (electrically
pumped). In a short time, food and medicine [distribution systems would
be ineffective; transportation]{.underline} [would fail or become so
chaotic as to be useless]{.underline}. [Law enforcement, medical staff,
and emergency personnel capabilities could be expected to be barely
functional in the short term and dysfunctional over sustained
periods]{.underline}.

[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} sustained [periods]{.underline}, the
science board stated, [[might last]{.underline}]{.mark} \"months or
[[years\" as government]{.underline}]{.mark} and industry sou[[ght to
rebuild]{.underline}]{.mark} damaged infrastructure \-- [[a possibility
that led the panel to compare]{.underline}]{.mark} the specter of
state-sponsored [[cyber attacks to the threat of nuclear
war.]{.underline}]{.mark} So if you think that 56 million payment cards
being compromised at Home Depot is about as bad as cyber threats can
get, think again. [Civilians and soldiers alike have hardly begun to
experience how destructive the coming age of information warfare is
going to be.]{.underline}

despite a few recent transatlantic missteps, [[recognises the gravity of
this moment and has come prepared with a focused set of priorities for
NATO's future.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Following his successful first trip to Europe, [a [string of recent US
decisions has undermined]{.mark}]{.underline} President [[Biden's early
pledges to strengthen cooperation with NATO allies]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Whether the tacit approval of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the chaotic
withdrawal from Afghanistan, or the controversial announcement of the
AUKUS security pact, these disjointed moves have begun to sow doubt in
Europe about America's willingness and ability to work jointly with
Europe, even under an Atlanticist president. While the Biden
administration has acknowledged and sought to address these slipups,
such unpredictability in the transatlantic relationship has weakened the
political cohesion required for building NATO's next Strategic Concept.

reactive approach, responding as if Russian and Chinese cyber attacks
are each isolated incidents]{.underline}]{.mark}. But because Russian
and Chinese cyber efforts are part of continuous campaigns directed at
the overall capability of the Alliance, [[NATO's response has been
insufficient, failing to reduce or dissuade further

acknowledged, [[China is moving closer]{.mark} to the
alliance]{.underline}. Aside from playing a bigger role in the Arctic,
Africa, and cyberspace, [China is making investments in new
infrastructure and weapon systems]{.underline}.3 [[Its growing]{.mark}
footprint and [influence in Europe, as well as]{.mark} its deepening
co[operation with Russia, create new challenges for
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, outlined here.

(through investment screening and export control mechanisms, for
example), [[DoD should more effectively incorporate NATO]{.mark} in its
efforts to address the most significant security challenge to the United
States.]{.underline}

Challenges China Poses to NATO

China does not pose a direct military threat to most NATO allies. But
[Beijing's economic and commercial investments in Europe and its growing
technological dominance---in areas ranging from artificial intelligence
to cyber]{.underline} and robotics---[are creating new challenges that
influence NATO's threat landscape]{.underline}. [[China's growing
footprint]{.mark} and influence in Europe [present NATO with]{.mark} the
following challenges:]{.underline}

[[Eroding N]{.mark}ATO [cohesion and unity. China is undermining
European cohesion by negotiating with European governments
bilaterally]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} through the 17+1 and Belt and
Road initiatives. Beijing's divide-and-rule tactics allow it to use its
economic influence to buy political leverage, which strains NATO
cohesion. Already, shortly after China invested in Greece's Piraeus
Port, Greece blocked an EU statement in the UN Human Rights Council that
criticized China's human rights record.4 China could use its significant
economic influence with other NATO members, such as Montenegro and
Italy, to coerce those allied governments away from joining consensus at
NATO on issues considered inimical to Chinese (or eventually Russian)
interests.

[[Jeopardizing NATO interoperability. China's sustained technological
prowess]{.mark} and innovation [present challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}
for both the United States and Europe[. [If the transatlantic partners
pursue different approaches]{.mark} to competing technologically with
China---either because of differing risk assessments or by implementing
different regulations---[this would lead to a transatlantic decoupling
of technology systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, if some NATO
members opted to include the Huawei kit in their 5G networks, NATO (and
the United States) could need to exclude those countries from NATO
communications and intelligence networks, including the Federated
Mission Network. Similarly, while China is supercharging its artificial
intelligence (AI) development, the United States and Europe are
implementing AI systems at different rates and proposing divergent
regulatory approaches to govern the use of AI, which could threaten the
interoperability of these systems.5

[[Eroding NATO's military]{.underline}]{.mark} edge. The Chinese
Communist Party's [[military-civil fusion strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}
to build the People's Liberation Army (PLA) into a world-class military
[[hinges on China's ability to procure dual-use
tools]{.underline}]{.mark}, including semiconductors and robotics
technology, from the United States and Europe. China seeks to gain a
military edge by bolstering its research and development (R&D) spending,
investing in critical technologies, and engaging in unfair trade
practices such as intellectual property theft and forced technology
transfers to acquire Western capabilities. In 2018, China spent \$462
billion per year on R&D funding---more than all of Europe's R&D budgets
combined.6 China's battle for the military edge is evident in artificial
intelligence; it seeks to "become a global leader in AI by 2030," in
order to skip a generation of military technology.7 The Chinese
Communist Party is working toward this goal by attempting to manufacture
advanced semiconductors, to acquire robotics companies and others that
underpin AI technology, and to purchase semiconductor manufacturing
equipment. These steps will allow China to build its own domestic
capacity.8 Over time, Chinese [[efforts to harness high technology to
improve the lethality of their military forces could erode]{.mark} the
U.S. and allied [military edge.]{.mark} This edge has always depended on
using advancements in military technology to win against adversaries who
have more forces and assets.]{.underline}

[[China actively exploits bilateral ties to impede unified
positions]{.mark} within the European Union, [making it a very easy step

The [technologies]{.underline} highlighted in this paper may [contribute
to the exacerbation of current trends in the cyber threat landscape and
herald]{.underline} so-called **[grey swan scenarios]{.underline}**.5
The [[increasing availability of powerful, easy-to-use and
inexpensive]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nologies is
[[likely to further stimulate the conduct of malicious activities
by]{.underline}]{.mark} a wide array of [[state and non-state
actor]{.underline}s]{.mark}. The
**[[democratisation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and 'servitisation'6 [[of
technology have enabled]{.underline}]{.mark} consumer
[[access]{.underline} [to a wide range of
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} [that were previously accessible only
by governments]{.underline}. This includes enabling technologies like
additive manufacturing and largescale distributed computing, to more
niche technological services such as ondemand development of bespoke
software-defined radio applications that could be used for disrupting
the electromagnetic environment. While most of these activities are
likely to entail low-tech tactics, [this trend could result in an even
greater volume of malicious activities]{.underline} than currently
witnessed.

[[The development of new]{.mark}, complex technological solutions and
[capabilities]{.mark} may also enable state-sponsored actors to conduct
advanced, covert or persistent attacks and activities which [could
undermine or jeopardise NATO's missions]{.mark} and day-to-day
operations]{.underline} [by]{.underline}, for example, [[exploiting
unknown vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the NATO supply chain to
gain access to sensitive information. [Sophisticated and persistent
attacks are likely to be less frequent, making these threats more
challenging for NATO to identify, detect, prepare for and
manage]{.underline} due to limited exposure to and knowledge of the
tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) employed. The [[proliferation
of connected and embedded systems]{.underline},]{.mark} particularly
through a drive towards the Internet of Things (IoT) [[and the
digitalisation of legacy infrastructure may also increase NATO's attack
surface and the likelihood of vulnerabilities that could be
exploited]{.mark} by malicious]{.underline} [actors]{.underline}.

What cyber threats could emerge over the next decade from new and
emerging technologies? How could NATO prepare for and manage them?
[Recent decades have seen a revolution in Information and Communication
Technologies]{.underline} (ICTs) and related technology areas. The
[development, proliferation, widespread use and embedding of
ICTs]{.underline} in contemporary societies [have resulted in
unprecedented change affecting all aspects of human activity, including
military and foreign affairs]{.underline}.

In defence, [this]{.underline} has been evident in cyber security and
network defence, but [has]{.underline} also [contributed to the growth
of hybrid threats1 and wider threats in the information
environment]{.underline}. In this context, [NATO]{.underline} and its
member states [are facing growing challenges from state and non-state
actors in cyberspace, with threats to the Alliance's integrity and
military operations and to the day-to-day functioning of its
institutions]{.underline} (NATO, 2020a).

In parallel with these developments, [[we have seen significant advances
in]{.mark} a wide array of new and emerging [technologies that could
have disruptive implications to the nature, scope and potential impact
of cyber threats to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The pace
of]{.underline}]{.mark} technological [[change is expected to
continue]{.underline}]{.mark} in the next decade [[and may have profound
effects on]{.mark} defence and [security matters]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Kepe et al., 2018). The [[rapid pace of change, the complexity and the
uncertainty of these developments require an understanding of their
implications to ensure NATO's ability to ensure resilience and
manoeuvrability in the cyber domain.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Strong transatlantic ties are critical to the U.S. economy

[[A stable]{.mark}, secure, and economically viable [Europe is in
America's economic interest]{.mark}]{.underline}. For more than 70
years, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO) and the U.S.

stability, which has economically benefited]{.mark}]{.underline} both
Europeans and [[Americans]{.mark}. The economies of Europe]{.underline},
**[along with]{.underline}** that of the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [account for]{.underline} approximately [half
of the global economy. The U[.S. and Europe are each other's principal
trading partners.]{.mark} The U.S [and Europe are each other's top
source of foreign]{.mark}]{.underline} direct [[investment. All of this
brings untold benefits to the U.S. economy]{.mark}]{.underline} and, by
extension, the American worker.

### NATO Impact: Hegemony

#### A strong NATO bolsters the U.S.'s military capabilities---important to our global leadership

As a military alliance, [[NATO's most important contribution]{.mark} to
American interests [is security]{.mark}.]{.underline} Above all, NATO
has helped keep the peace in Europe after centuries of division and war.
NATO has invested for decades in the ability of its members to operate
together---so-called "interoperability"--- based on practiced
procedures, common standards and NATO's historically unique integrated
military command structure. Many of NATO's partners also share in this
interoperability. [This military potential means that when America faces
security challenges anywhere, it has ready teammates based on NATO,
either with the Alliance as a collective whole or with select allies to
form a purpose-built military coalition.]{.underline} Further, [[NATO
allies provide America basing]{.mark} and access
[rights]{.mark}]{.underline} across Europe; [[bringing U.S.
forces]{.mark} a continent [closer to trouble spots]{.mark}]{.underline}
in the Middle East, Africa and beyond, [[and providing improved response
times and]{.underline} [sustainability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bases like
Lakenheath in the U.K., Ramstein in Germany, Aviano in Italy, Rota in
Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and İncirlik in Turkey are strategic assets.
NATO allies employ tens of thousands of intelligence personnel,
extending the reach of the United States' eyes and ears.125 In short,
[[NATO **reinforces** America's national military strength with
increased **scale**, **diversity** and geographic
**position**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

NATO is not perfect. This report addresses the array of significant
challenges the Alliance must face. At heart, however, Americans must
remember that [[a Europe "whole, free and at peace" is fundamentally in
the U.S. interest and NATO is America's primary bridge across the
Atlantic]{.mark}.]{.underline}126 In fact, [most Americans continue to
support NATO overwhelmingly]{.underline}.127 America by itself enjoys
great human capital, vast resources and favorable geographic position.
[[Together with its allies,]{.mark} both in NATO and in East Asia,
[America holds an unmatched geo-strategic advantage over any potential
competitor]{.mark}, today and for the foreseeable future. America's main
strategic competitors, China and Russia, do not compare. [Sustaining
this strategic advantage by nurturing]{.mark} and investing
in]{.underline} alliances, beginning with [[NATO, is]{.mark} therefore
[in America's vital national interest. Allies are the ultimate guarantee
of American security]{.mark} and prosperity.]{.underline}

[At its core, [it is a resource question: Can the U.S. advance its
global interests without]{.mark} Europe, or, more precisely, would a
world without [NATO]{.mark} and strong U.S.--EU relations be cheaper for
the U.S. or for Europe? [The answer is: no. One of the America's
greatest strategic advantages are its alliances]{.mark} and
partnerships.]{.underline} From a European perspective, the most
fundamental truth about NATO has not changed since 1949: [[Europe
cannot]{.mark} yet guarantee its own security without the U.S., given
the capability gaps in European armed forces. Nor can it
[address]{.mark} the myriad other security [challenges]{.mark} it faces
[from China]{.mark}, to [terrorism,]{.mark} to technological dependence
to [climate change without effective U.S.--EU cooperation.]{.mark}
Finally, [if the democratic world is going to mount a successful defense
against authoritarian states' efforts to rewrite global norms in their
own favor, the family of NATO and EU nations must make up the core of
that defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### NATO Impact: Liberal Order

#### Allied coop key to the liberal order---the U.S. can still rebound

Finally, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[ought]{.mark} not simply recommit
itself [to]{.mark} its]{.underline} capable European and Asian [allies,
but [make allied coordination the basis of its strategy going forward
--- against]{.mark}]{.underline} traditional military
[[threats]{.underline},]{.mark} as well as those that may be [less
visible and just as deadly. As is more evident by the day, [the
alternative is a system in which Washington is increasingly sidelined.
If China exits this epochal crisis as a confident leader it will not be
the ineluctable result of a structural shift]{.mark};]{.underline}
Beijing will have Washington's calamitous domestic mismanagement and
myopic foreign policy to thank for it. [[If,]{.mark} as part of its own
recovery, however, the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates can
[return itself to a strategy that seeks domestic security and prosperity
through international cooperation, it stands a chance of helping to
build new forms of order that prevent the next crisis]{.mark}. The
prospect feels dimmer but is not yet lost]{.underline}.

#### Reforming NATO bolsters the liberal international order

accessed 4-25-22\]

[[If NATO sees itself as an alliance that supports the liberal
international order]{.underline}]{.mark} as much as the defense of
Europe, [[it must prepare to help its partners
counter]{.underline}]{.mark}---or, better still, preempt---the challenge
to this order from [[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [That order
is worth defendin]{.underline}g for the simple reason that it remains
the best framework for a system comprising many players.

That said, institutions such as [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} that reflect
the past [[will need to adjust]{.underline}]{.mark} to the new reality
of global power distribution. Institutions have to solve problems for
people to consider them relevant.17 When those problems and
circumstances change, so should policies. For NATO, this means that the
alliance may need to make contingency plans to relieve U.S. forces in
the Atlantic, the Middle East, and Africa if they are required in the
Pacific. The alliance may also need to strengthen its support to the EU
in Eastern European countries that are being actively courted by Chinese
and Russian diplomacy backed up by promises of developmental projects.

[NATO can also shape the emerging global order by holding steady to, and
universalizing, the principles and practices that make it
successful]{.underline}: being a magnet for countries in transition to
representative government, protecting countries that share the
alliance's values, and working hard to mold national interests into
cooperative internationalism.18 More specifically, NATO needs to
strengthen partnerships with like-minded countries such as Argentina,
Australia, Chile, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, and South Korea. The
alliance needs to find ways to penalize Russia and China for assaults
against weaker states. And NATO must effectively motivate countries in
transition, such as Ukraine, to keep adopting better governance and rule
of law practices that align with the coalition's expectations.

Finally, [[NATO can help forge the coming multilateral world order
because it has the capacity to constantly evolve and adjust to new
security environments]{.underline}]{.mark}. The allies should apply that
spirit of adaptability to support reform of the UN Security Council,
which is woefully unrepresentative, and strengthen the UN's powers to
enforce rules that have been adopted by consensus. Stronger institutions
help free societies prosper and constrain illiberal challengers.

Fortunately for NATO, the alliance is representative, and its members
are empowered, active, and used to finding mutually agreeable solutions.
That is why NATO is both perpetually in crisis and the most successful
security alliance in modern history.19

"The Conservative Case for NATO".

The conservative case for NATO is not that it strengthens liberal world
order. Rather, the conservative case for [NATO]{.underline} is that it
[bolsters American national interests. [In an age of great-power
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}, as identified by the Trump
administration, [[America's]{.mark} Western [alliance provides the U.S.
with]{.mark} some dramatic [comparative advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The United States, Canada, and their European [[allies have]{.mark} a
number of [common interests]{.mark}]{.underline} and common challenges
[[with regard to Beijing, Moscow, terrorism, cyberattacks]{.mark},
migration, [nuclear weapons, and]{.mark} military [readiness. NATO is
the one]{.mark} formal [alliance that allows]{.mark} for [cooperation on
these matters.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is also the only alliance that
embodies America's civilizational ties with Europe --- a point
forcefully made by President Trump when he visited Poland in 2017.
Properly understood, [[NATO]{.mark} helps [keeps]{.mark} America's
strategic [competitors at bay]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [pushing back on
Russian and Chinese influence]{.underline}]{.mark}. In all of these
ways, [[the]{.mark} U.S. alliance [system]{.mark} in Europe [is]{.mark}
a bit [like oxygen]{.mark}]{.underline}. [You may take it for granted,
but [you'll miss it when it's gone.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### NATO Impact: Russia War

#### Cohesion checks Russia attack

Economics and Political Science and Hugh Sandeman, Visiting Senior
Fellow, LSE Ideas and Project Head of Global Strategies, "NATO and the
Future Character of Warfare," Strategic Update, LSE IDEAS, London School
of Economics, 9---21, p. 12\]

[[This limit to NATO's cohesion is central to Russian thinking
about]{.mark} future [warfare]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe. [[Russian
caution about the ability to prevail against a united NATO]{.mark}
alliance in]{.underline} a prolonged [conflict [is consistent with a
focus on the initial stages of conflict, and on
exploiting]{.underline}]{.mark} [the potentially d[ivisive political
impact on NATO of a sudden outbreak of hostilities followed by a rapid
fait accompli. Any such operation would likely be designed to fragment
NATO as swiftly as possible,]{.mark} undermining the coherent political
and military response]{.underline} needed for rapid reinforcement,
general mobilisation, timely escalation, and the restoration of
deterrence.

[Russia would seek to impose its own rules of warfare in any conflict
with NATO]{.underline}, as it did in Crimea.26 It could exploit NATO's
lack of nuclear deterrence in Europe, where Russia has developed and
exercised the forces and strategies needed for threatening to use
nuclear weapons, for the purposes of sudden escalation. Alternatively,
Russia could deploy calibrated kinetic terror against a NATO state or
part of a state, to demonstrate the costs of a wider war. Cyber sabotage
could also be widely used for the same purposes. All these
[actions]{.underline}---in line with the strategies of unpeace and
information warfare---[would be aimed at fragmenting the unity within
NATO that would be necessary for a coherent political and military
response.]{.underline}27 The fundamental objective would be a
realignment of political forces in Europe, rather than seizing and
holding territory. The importance of speed in bringing pressure to bear
on NATO, and in achieving rapid military and political impact, was
demonstrated in the Russian mobilisation of troops and armour on the
eastern border of Ukraine in April 2021.

In contrast to the West, [[Russia has explicitly linked resilience to
the possibility of war]{.mark}, reflecting a close integration of the
political and military aspects of security. It has sought to instil
among the Russian public a degree of resilience]{.underline} to the
possible impact of conflict, by means of domestic propaganda and
warnings concerning the ongoing dangers of nuclear war.28 In this
respect, [Russia appears to be focused as much on characteristics of war
that remain unchanged, as it is on technological and other determinants
of future warfare]{.underline}.

### NATO Impact: Stability

#### NATO is necessary to address several global threats

<https://www.government.nl/latest/news/2022/03/21/what-does-nato-do-netherlands-safety>,
accessed 6-4-22\]

Safety and security in the Netherlands

A safer world also means a safer Netherlands. Why? [[Take for instance
terrorism, nuclear weapons or cyberattacks. These threats have one thing
in common: they don't stop at borders.]{.underline}]{.mark}

So our own safety and security often starts abroad. That's why it's
important to have good relations with other countries. And to protect
stability in the world together. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs works
hard to do this. [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[plays an important
role.]{.underline}]{.mark} But what exactly is NATO?

What is NATO?

NATO stands for 'North Atlantic Treaty Organization'. It is a military
alliance of 30 countries in Europe and North America. Its headquarters
is in Brussels. The Netherlands is a member of NATO. NATO was set up in
1949, not long after the end of the Second World War. Its aim: to
protect the security and freedom of all the countries that are members
(the Allies). And [[right now, that Alliance is]{.underline}]{.mark}
perhaps [[more important than ever.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Worldwide security challenges

[[The world is]{.mark} a [less safe]{.mark} place than before.
Even]{.underline} in areas near the Netherlands. [[Take]{.mark} for
instance the [war in Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} started by President
Putin. [[Or China: a growing]{.mark} global economic and military [power
that is flexing its muscles]{.mark}]{.underline} more and more often.
[**[Tech]{.mark}**nological [developments also lead to new threats, like
cyberattacks]{.mark}. Or the use of modern weapons]{.underline}, like
drones, that can attack targets without humans having to risk their
lives.

And [[climate change can also lead to more conflicts, or make conflicts
worse. Countries need each other so they can prevent and combat these
global threats]{.mark}.]{.underline}

NATO and diplomacy

NATO is a defensive military alliance. You might think NATO is all about
military action. But there is another very important step that comes
first. NATO's main priority is diplomacy. By talking to each other and
with other countries, we try to solve conflicts without using force.

Within NATO, the Allies work together and make agreements. For instance
on protecting democratic values. Examples are: being able to hold free
and fair elections, equal rights for everyone, and freedom of
expression.

Within NATO, military and non-military experts meet to exchange
information about what is happening in the world. In this way, NATO
prepares itself for the challenges and threats of today and of the
future. With military and diplomatic action.

NATO in the world

[[NATO]{.mark} also [helps other countries]{.mark}]{.underline} -- that
aren't members of NATO -- [[with their security]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For instance by helping them train their soldiers. NATO soldiers can
also be sent to deal with a crisis. This is important for the
Netherlands too. [Because the world is becoming more and more closely
connected. And our safety and security is also connected to that of
other countries.]{.underline}

[[The tense atmosphere]{.mark} between Washington and European capitals
[has exacerbated internal rifts]{.mark} [in the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}---some of which are as old as NATO itself.
[Because collective deterrence and defense are entirely built on the
credibility of each member's commitment]{.underline} to Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty, [these [divisions risk rendering the Alliance
ineffective and vulnerable to external threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
EU continues to be plagued by NorthSouth and East-West tensions.
Post-Brexit, the UK is also recalibrating its relationships with the EU,
NATO and the U.S.

Tensions on issues beyond the military realm from trade to China to
technology further undercut the transatlantic commitment to raise and
maintain defense spending to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP, with
Germany the leading backslider on its 2024 pledge. This problem will be
exacerbated by the deep recession on both sides of the Atlantic
precipitated by COVID-19 and the high cost of recovery.

Recent European calls for strategic autonomy have raised hackles in
Washington and also revived the specter of NATO--EU rivalry without yet
increasing military capability. While the creation of the European
Defense Fund is promising, Europeans will be hard-pressed to increase
defense spending until their economies fully recover. The EU lost 20% of
its military throw-weight when the UK exited and remains far from
autonomous in all but modest-sized operations. However, the U.S. will
not get more security help from Europe by browbeating Allies in public
or fear-mongering about European autonomy.

[[Washington will be more successful in maintaining spending levels and
addressing capability gaps through targeted mentoring]{.mark} of
individual Allies and partners and offers of co-development of key
systems]{.underline}. In particular, [[Washington should help Allies
keep pace in addressing the security challenges posed by adversaries'
cyber weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} and advancements in AI, quantum
computing and autonomous and space weapons. At the same time, [[the U.S.
should welcome any level of autonomy that Europe can achieve]{.mark} in
keeping itself safe.]{.underline} The more Europeans can do on their
own, the less the U.S. burden for their defense.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[sets]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[emphasis on infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, civil preparedness,
continuity of services, accumulation of reserves and ensuring access to
them [as well as on various procedures facilitating rapid crisis
response .Its major concern is that the Alliance has come to rely
heavily on the private sector when moving, deploying and sustaining its
forces]{.underline}; therefore it devotes much attention to civilian
capabilities and civil-military interaction. This is understandable
given its role as a "military responder" and "force multiplier" in
military conflicts.Just asthe EU, [[it should not]{.mark},]{.underline}
however, [[neglect its role in helping
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}---both allies and partners---[[maintain
their ability to reform themselves]{.mark} in the face of
adversity.After all,]{.underline} astheWarsaw Summit statement states,
["The [foundation of our resilience lies in our shared commitment to the
principles of individual liberty]{.mark}]{.underline}, democracy, human
rights, and the rule of law."7 [[Should this commitment fall apart, the
Alliance's cohesion, solidarity and very existence will be
endangered]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Resilience key to NATO---weakest link

**Hall & Sandeman, London School of Economics researchers, '22**

Economics and Political Science and Hugh Sandeman, Visiting Senior
Fellow, LSE Ideas and Project Head of Global Strategies, "NATO's
Resilience: The First and Last Line of Defence," Strategic Update, LSE
IDEAS, 5---22, London School of Economics p. 9-10\]

The tendency to conflate Article 3 resilience obligations and the wider
responsibilities of the "baseline" requirements was carried over into
the Strengthened Resilience Commitment. The 2021 Summit Communiqué spoke
of NATO adopting "a more integrated and better coordinated approach,
consistent with our collective commitment under Article 3 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure our militaries can
effectively operate in peace, crisis and conflict".20 It was agreed that
"allies will develop a proposal to establish, assess, review and monitor
resilience objectives to guide nationally-developed resilience goals and
implementation plans". 21 Each individual ally was to decide how to do
this.

Apart from the potentially troublesome issue of how numerous national
resilience goals may or may not aggregate into "collective resilience",
[[there is a challenge of how to create common standards when resilience
remains the responsibility of individual members. This problem is
particularly apparent in terms of concerns about "weak links" within
NATO]{.underline}.]{.mark} When outlining the forthcoming Strategic
Concept, [Secretary General Stoltenberg noted]{.underline} in his
discussion of resilience that "[[this must be a collective effort ...
because we are only as strong as our weakest
link]{.underline}]{.mark}".22 [Concerns about "weak links" within NATO
have grown]{.underline} in the post-Cold War era. Not only has NATO
relied on internal cohesion around the significance of liberal values to
provide its continuing rationale after the dissolution of the Soviet
Union,23 but [the diffusion of power in the contemporary international
security environment means that [American military might cannot alone
provide the balancing force it once did. This makes national resilience
all the more important]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### \[x\] Resilience is critical to NATO's effectiveness---must be able to respond to outside attacks

**Psychogiou, Finabel researcher, '22**

\[Vasiliki Psychogiou, Finabel research intern, "Cyberspace: Is NATO
Doing Enough?" Finabel---European Army Interoperability Centre, Info
Flash, 2---22, p. 4\]

NATO remains associated with more classical military operations outside
its territory. However, [[today's]{.mark} nonconventional
[threats]{.mark} can [originate just as easily from within and outside
NATO's borders]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shea, 2020). [Thus, [NATO needs to
constantly enhance its resilience capacity to better achieve early
warning of attacks, best limit the damage and recover as quickly as
possible]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shea, 2020). [[NATO can]{.mark} also
[share its leadership]{.mark} and decisionmaking wi[th]{.mark} civilian
actors [outside the conventional]{.mark} military [chain of
command]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shea, 2020). [[Coherent policies with a
common denominator that the Allies are all willing to support can
empower NATO's posture]{.underline}]{.mark} (Shea, 2020; NATO, 2021;
NATO, 2020; Deschaux-Dutard, 2021; Brent, 2019; Shea, 2020).

\* [[China's penetration of Europe through its high-tech
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} and low-tech acquisition of ports and
rail lines [[can pose problems for NATO]{.mark}, including [slowing
military mobility, providing Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline} (and possibly
Russia, at some point) [[with intelligence]{.mark} on allied force
movements, [and compromising NATO command and control]{.mark}. [Undue
Chinese influence]{.mark} in some allied capitals can [also be used to
coerce those governments]{.mark} from joining consensus at NATO on
issues considered inimical to Chinese]{.underline} (or Russian)
[interests.]{.underline}

\* [[To combat this influence, NATO must make sure that allies are able
to fill their capability gaps through homegrown solutions, not purchases
of Chinese]{.mark} **[tech]{.mark}**nology. NATO should also work with
the European Union, including to jointly develop a review mechanism that
considers Chinese purchases of critical infrastructure]{.underline} in
Europe and supply chain security.

# Resilience Aff: Russia / Hybrid Extensions

### Hybrid Status Quo: Current policy Fails

#### Current efforts are inadequate---we need a coordinated policy

for European Policy Analysis, "A Strategic Concept for Countering
Russian and Chinese Hybrid Threats," Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security, Atlantic Council, 7---20, p. 10-11\]

Indeed, all of these efforts, among others, have helped transatlantic
policymakers and publics better understand hybrid threats, build new
tools to combat them, and develop the legal frameworks and mandates to
take action, especially at the tactical level. Yet, [even [these efforts
have failed to deter Russia and China from using hybrid
activities]{.mark}. Despite the utility of many of these transatlantic
efforts, the [whole is less than the sum of its parts]{.mark} for three
overarching reasons]{.underline}.

[[First is the lack of understanding]{.mark}. Transatlantic governments
have each compiled different threat assessments based on their
individual experiences with hybrid activities, which has complicated the
formation of a common understanding of hybrid threats]{.underline}. Due
to a lack of integrated analytical capabilities, information-sharing
obstacles, and sensitivities around nations revealing their
vulnerabilities, the transatlantic community has yet to develop a full
understanding of the impacts of hybrid activities and how they connect
across contexts. Relatedly, nations and institutions often hesitate to
use real-world scenarios when exercising responses to hybrid threats out
of fear of publicly failing to navigate them. Opting for imagined
scenarios, which often lack sufficient nuances and complexities,
inhibits their ability to identify shortfalls and learn which approaches
work. All of this has severely limited the effectiveness of
transatlantic counter-hybrid efforts thus far.

[[Second is the lack of sufficient resources]{.underline}]{.mark}. On
the whole, transatlantic counter-hybrid efforts remain far too
under-resourced in terms of budgets and appropriate personnel. For
example, the EU's East StratCom Task Force has a dedicated budget of
just three million euros with only sixteen staff to cover
counter-disinformation efforts across the entire EU.34 Similarly, NATO's
quick-response CHSTs are not resourced to be standing forces, so they
require significant time to recruit required expertise (think of
white-hat hackers, as opposed to one of NATO's many policy experts), let
alone form and deploy. Even when counter-hybrid efforts are well-funded
in accordance with stated policy, complex governmental and institutional
budget requirements often prevent funds from flowing to specific places
where they are needed most. Insufficient resourcing limits the scope of
these efforts and their larger strategic effect. In the face of
widespread, pervasive, and diverse hybrid activities, this is a huge
obstacle.

[[Third is the lack of coordination]{.mark} on the national and
international levels. Cross-cutting hybrid threats often touch numerous
parts of governments, requiring tireless coordination among various
agencies on everything from intelligence to responses]{.underline}. The
national interagency process in most countries also lacks adequate
involvement from civil society and the private sector when it comes to
counter-hybrid efforts. If not effective at the national level,
coordination at the international level is more difficult for the thirty
different countries inside NATO or the EU. Inter-institutional
cooperation between NATO and the EU becomes almost impossible then,
especially given long-standing political and bureaucratic obstacles
plaguing their relations. This forces nearly all coordination to be
informal, relying on pragmatic personalities and creative solutions
among officials to achieve results. On top of everything, there is no
single platform to convene relevant authorities from NATO, the EU, their
nations, the private sector, and civil society to coordinate. As a
result, transatlantic counter-hybrid efforts have remained largely
disjointed, producing a patchwork effect.

In light of this, [[next-level actions are needed to address the
knowledge, resource, and coordination gaps]{.mark}]{.underline} outlined
above. [[An enhanced approach is required to meaningfully deter and
limit Russia's and China's further use of hybrid
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the wake of the coronavirus crisis,
[[the need for NATO]{.mark} and EU [nations to focus on domestic
political, health, and economic agendas will make coordination on hybrid
issues more difficult]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time, the crisis
underscores that hybrid issues---including those around
pandemics---cannot be solved alone. This provides a stronger impetus for
cooperation among core transatlantic allies. [[What is needed now is a
much more comprehensive, coherent, and forward-leaning transatlantic
strategy]{.mark} for countering Russian and Chinese hybrid
threats.]{.underline}

### Hybrid Status Quo: Threat Now

#### Hybrid threats will only grow---we need to step up our response

Russian and Chinese Hybrid Threats," Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security, Atlantic Council, 7---20, p. 1\]

[[Tackling hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly from state
actors such as Russia and China, [[remains one of the greatest
challenges for the transatlantic community]{.mark}. Hybrid threats have
gained more traction among policymakers and publics]{.underline} across
Europe and the United States, especially in a world with COVID-19. The
recent coronavirus pandemic has thrust hybrid activities to the center
of transatlantic debates. Both China and Russia capitalized on the
crisis to wage disinformation campaigns against the West, while
strategically delivering aid to European countries in attempts to build
good will on the international stage. Yet, [even [as hybrid activities
have accelerated, limited progress has been achieved]{.mark} in
countering them or deterring competitors from using them]{.underline}.
Over the last five years, Euro-Atlantic nations and institutions, such
as NATO and the European Union (EU), have taken important steps to
respond to hybrid issues. But [[as hybrid threats become more prominent
in the future, policymakers must move toward a more coherent, effective,
and proactive strategy for countering Russian and Chinese hybrid
threats.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Hybrid Impact: Credibililty / Global War

#### Disinformation threatens conflict escalation and undermines U.S. credibility

INITIAL EXPLORATION OF THE DIMINISHING ROLE OF FACTS AND ANALYSIS IN
AMERICAN PUBLIC LIFE, RAND Corporation, 2018, p. 218-219\]

[[Policy uncertainty that seems to derive]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least
in part, [[from Truth Decay could]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[have
**diplomatic implications**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Allies and
adversaries]{.mark} that are uncertain about whether to trust prior
policy positions]{.underline} taken by U.S. leaders, [or that [are
unable to determine whether a commitment (or]{.mark}]{.underline}, in
the case of an adversary, a [threat]{.underline}) [is authentic, could
act in ways that run counter to U.S. interests]{.underline}. For
example, an ally that lacks confidence in the strength of a U.S.
commitment might turn to another partner for additional support,
depriving the United States of a potentially important political or
economic relationship. An adversary that believes a prior U.S. position
is not an accurate reflection of U.S. intent might challenge the United
States and contribute to an escalation of hostilities. Such institutions
as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the post--World War II
alliance structure have reduced some of the uncertainty surrounding
diplomatic commitments, but, in the first half of 20th century, there
were no such guarantees, and uncertainty was considerably higher.
[Should Truth Decay contribute to an increase in this uncertainty, it
[is possible that the risk of unintentional escalation and even conflict
would increase]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, as alluded to previously, [Truth Decay alongside
polarization]{.underline} (one of its drivers) [can further exacerbate
policy uncertainty with additional domestic and international
implications]{.underline}. Policies that are based not on shared and
commonly accepted facts but on selective adoption and rejection of facts
may be subject to rapid change and reversal when congressional
leadership or the presidency changes hands or parties. Polarization
exacerbates this tendency, as it increases the ideological distance
between policymakers on each side of the spectrum and increases the
chances of "policy whiplash" when legislative or executive power shifts
from one party to the other. At the domestic level, rapid policy
reversals may lead to any number of negative consequences, including
financial loss for individuals or corporations, wasted resources at the
government and individual level, and instability in economic, health
care, or insurance markets that have direct implications for individual
constituents. In addition, [policy reversals may further undermine trust
in key institutions. At the international level, [policy reversals
compromise U.S. credibility, can harm alliances]{.mark} and
partnerships, [and risk triggering escalation that may lead ultimately
to **full blown conflict.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Bradshaw, who will become NATO commander later this month, said [Russia
posed a "hybrid threat" to NATO members]{.underline}.

"It's not just the threat of overt military attack, but [it's a raft of
other measures]{.underline}, including covert, paramilitary, and
non-military activities, some of which will be coordinated by the
intelligence arms of Russia," General Bradshaw added.

"And we as NATO need to have our antenna tuned to the signs that this
sort of hostile activity is going on."

He accused the Kremlin of "showing a proclivity to disobey the rules of
international relations" with its military incursion into Crimea and
alleged backing for rebels in eastern Ukraine.

"[We need to put in place thoroughly effective and convincing
deterrence]{.underline} so that everybody knows where the red lines
are," General Bradshaw said.

"We are effectively building and sustaining military capability so that
we never have to use it."

Bradshaw's comments come against the backdrop of growing calls in the
United States for a thorough investigations of the Russian government's
broad campaign to secure the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president
-- and the nature and scope of contacts between several Trump's
surrogates and high-level campaign aides and operatives of the two
Russian intelligence services -- the FSB and the GRU. These two
organizations were behind the hacking campaign against the computer
systems of the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton's campaign.

The unanimous conclusion of the seventeen agencies making up the U.S.
intelligence community was that "We assess Russian President Vladimir
Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S.
presidential election," in the words of a report released by the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence.

"[[Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} US [[democratic process]{.underline}]{.mark},
denigrate Secretary Clinton and harm her electability and potential
presidency.

"We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear
preference for President-elect Trump."

A recent report by the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said
the "rise of [fake news" emanating from Russia was a cause of growing
concern]{.underline}, pointing to the role of state-owned outlets Russia
Today and Sputnik in spreading Russian propaganda and fake news
masquerading as journalism.

European intelligence agencies have said that [[Russia's
success]{.underline}]{.mark} in helping elect Trump to the presidency of
the United States [[has emboldened Moscow to replicated in Europe the
methods it used in its interference in the U.S]{.mark}. presidential
campaign.]{.underline} European security [[services have already seen
signs of Russia's hacking and disinformation campaign]{.mark} [aiming to
help far-right, ethno-nationalist, and populist
politicians]{.mark}]{.underline} win the coming elections in France, the
Netherlands, and Germany.

As is the case with Trump, [[these politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} --
Marine Le Pen and the National Front in France, the AfD (Alternative für
Deutschland) in Germany, and Geert Wilders and his Party of Freedom in
the Netherlands -- [[aim to weaken the West by undermining]{.mark} or
dismantling]{.underline} the two central pillars of Western post-Second
World War security and prosperity -- the system of [[military
alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}, including NATO, [[and the liberal
international economic order]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the EU and
the WTO.

Not coincidentally, as is the case with Trump, the three [[European
political movements being helped by Russia are openly pro-Russian and
critical of Western economic and political sanctions]{.mark} taken to
punish Russia for its actions in Crimea and Ukraine]{.underline}.

#### Democratic erosion undermines the global order---risks war and an inability to solve other existential threats

**Beck, MPS, Stellenbosch University, '20**

\[Cassidi Beck, "The Rise of Strongmen Leaders: A Threat to Global
Security," MPS Thesis, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Stellenbosch
University, supervised by Dr. Derica Lambrechts, 3---20, p. 81-86\]

[With the rise of]{.underline} Strongmen like [Orban, Putin and
Erdogan]{.underline}, where these [[populists]{.mark} have accessed
government]{.underline}, a subsequent [erosion of liberal democratic
principles has been followed]{.underline} (Albertazzi & Mueller,
2013:350). Authoritarian countries are openly challenging global rules
and ideas about freedom and making the case that their socio-political
systems work better than liberal democracy. These Strongmen pose a
"substantial negative effect on democratic quality" (Huber & Schi\`mpf,
2017:146 as they "increasingly reject liberal values" (Cederman,
2019:61).

Even if one disagrees with Francis Fukuyama's thesis, there is still
evidence that highlights that, despite its shortcomings, democracy
inherently has important tenants that other regimes do not offer.
Democracy stresses the intrinsic importance of transparency, civil
liberty, rule of law, horizontal accountability, and minority rights. It
guarantees fundamental rights and civil liberties -- freedom to pursue
one's legitimate interests, to hold political, social and cultural
beliefs, and to be able to express them without interference from the
state (Albertazzi & Mueller, 2013:350; Mounk & Fao, 2018). High-minded
defenders of liberal democracy argue that there is something uniquely
legitimate about the political system. Its democratic element, they
claim, ensures citizens' equality, while its liberal element ensures
citizens' freedom. As such, the genius of liberal democracy is that it
can honour both these values simultaneously. It allows each citizen
access in the public sphere while giving them the ability to have a
private life; "only liberal democracy can fulfil some of the deepest and
most universal human aspirations" (Mounk, 2018:129-130).

Thus, in conclusion, the use of Fukuyama's original essay The End of
History and the Last Man is not to disagree with or critique his thesis.
It is rather a reflection on his thesis and posits that political events
currently arising pose an obstacle to this perceived future. Rather, to
highlight that current events, specifically the rise of political
Strongmen, are incompatible with a future that was believed to be marked
by democracy, stability and security. The turbulence of current
geopolitics does not have to be read as a rebuttal of Fukuyama's
original thesis, however, an assessment of Strongman leadership and the
fluctuations such leadership may bring towards geopolitics are an
important contrast to what Fukuyama predicted. The next section will
examine more specifically the possible outcomes these Strongmen could
have on geopolitical security -- the ramifications of their tendency to
erode democratic institutions, to violate human rights, promote
nationalistic populism and break the principle of sovereignty and
international law.

4.3. The Strongman's Ramifications for Geopolitical Security

Although the rise of the Strongman and their illiberal democracy offers
an alternative to democracy, their actions, policies and leadership
style indicate that [they [pose a risk to geopolitical
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an increasingly connected and
globalised world, what appears to be local in nature is in fact global
in impact as most elements contain global dimensions (Kaldor, 2001).
These rising and existing Strongmen across the globe and their
leadership style has the potential of negative ramifications for global
security. The actions undertaken by leaders such as Putin, Orban and
Erdogan towards democratic institutions, human rights and international
law, as well as their nationalistic populism will likely have a
far-reaching impact. As noted in Chapter Three, in a regional capacity
these leaders have not only undermined their nations' democracy but have
also created an environment of hostility and insecurity. Reflecting on
Chapter Three, the next section will examine how these Strongmen's
ability to create regional instability could possibly lead to
geopolitical instability and insecurity.

4.3.1. A New Global Order

US Hegemony or "the American century" was born amid the collapse of the
Berlin Wall in 1989 and the end of the Cold War (King, 2017:215;
Zakaria, 2019:10). Following the collapse of communism, it seemed the
West's model of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism, supported
by a clear set of US-sponsored international rules, would spread across
the globe. Under the guise of the Washington Consensus, it laid the
foundations for recommendations on how nations should interact with one
another on the premise of creating wealth and championing liberal
democracy (Banos, 2017:92; Rose, 2019:11). In the advocating of the
Washington Consensus, the foundation of international law was said to be
based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity; non-aggression towards others, non-interference
in the internal affairs of others, equality and mutual benefit, peaceful
co-existence, respect for human rights and basic freedoms and national
self-determination (Banos, 2017; King, 2017; Rose, 2019:11).

However, politically and economically, the West's vision has seemed to
reach its limits, as geopolitical and ideological rivals undermine the
foundations of the liberal world order (Frankopan, 2018:52; Kazan &
Park, 2019; Russell-Mead, 2018:15). Mounting opposition from emerging
superpowers, increasing resistance to globalisation and the core tenants
of liberal democracy from emerging political movements, and the rise of
political Strongmen across the world, could lead to the creation of a
new world order. This rebalancing of power with Strongmen at the helm
could have potential implications for global security, as nations like
Russia, Hungary and Turkey forge their own political orthodoxy (Banos,
2017:121; Frankopan, 2018:147; Weiss, 2019:92).

Evidence suggests that the new world order, one not championed by a
liberal consensus, could potentially lead to a more insecure
geopolitical future. This argument extends from the Strongman's tendency
to reject the international rules-based system, as previously noted by
Putin, Erdogan and Orban's dismissal of international law, treaties and
the core principle of sovereignty. While the new world order will still
be based on a foundation of rules, scholars argue that with Strongmen
becoming more prominent and powerful, the resulting new norm will be
characterised by geopolitical competition, doubts about security
commitments to allies, challenges to the fundamentals of the global
trading regime and the abandoning of the promotion of freedom and
democracy; these will become the defining features of a new foreign
policy (Daalder & Lindsay, 2018:72; Haass, 2019:30; Kazan & Park, 2019).
As Orban, Putin and Erdogan have shown, there will be little regard for
democratic institutions and tenants, civil rights and political freedoms
will be restrained while international law and the principle of
sovereignty will hold little value. This could have the potential of
escalating rivalries and thus create unstable implications for global
security (Frankopan, 2018:144).

[[This new global order could]{.underline}]{.mark} also potentially
[[see the end of important international
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} and treaties, such as the
Trans-Atlantic partnership, the EU, the World Trade Organisation and the
International Monetary Fund. International [institutions]{.underline}
are important as they [provide the framework within which countries
can]{.underline} happily [engage]{.underline} with each other and, help
co-ordinate the actions of different countries in order to set stable
expectations (Blackwill & Harris, 2016:74; Frankopan, 2018:237).
Treaties and international [[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[help]{.mark} to [foster security as they]{.mark}]{.underline} provide
frameworks through which countries interact,
**[[creat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing [cooperation]{.underline}, helping
[to [foster]{.underline}]{.mark} mutual [[understanding and
stability]{.underline}]{.mark} (Haass, 2019:30; Frankopan, 2018:222;
King, 2017:225). [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} also help foster global
security as through their creating of cooperation they help to [[ensure
a global response to]{.underline}]{.mark} the creation of solutions for
[[global problems]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Many global issues and [[threats such as climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[refugee crisis]{.underline}]{.mark},
growing [[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} and rising socioeconomic
[inequalities [require]{.mark}]{.underline} the harmonizing of domestic
and foreign policies and the willingness of [[countries to work
together]{.mark}. Therefore]{.underline}, [[without
established]{.underline}]{.mark} and agreed upon [i[nstitutions]{.mark},
[the way in which states interact with each other could potentially
be]{.mark}]{.underline} characterised as strained and
[[difficult]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Future security threats demand a more
pluralistic response]{.underline} that can be best accomplished by
combining resources (Drozdiak, 2017:91; Frankopan, 2018:74). [Prosperity
and well-being]{.underline} may [depend on global
solutions]{.underline}. However, u[nder the guise of leaders like Orban,
Putin and Erdogan, many politicians and governments are taking steps to
diminish co-operatio]{.underline}n with each other, disengaging from
bilateral agreements and international co-operation. Instead these
leaders erode confidence in international institutions and perceptions
of stability as they "operate on a tornado of impulses" (Frankopan,
2018:157). As the Strongman is more likely to choose aggression and
isolationism over collaboration and cooperation, [the [world
could]{.mark} possibly [descend into]{.mark} further [conflict]{.mark}
as frictions are elevated]{.underline} (Haass, 2019:30; Kazan & Park,
2019; King, 2017:244).

A [world order]{.underline} led by Russia under Vladimir Putin, with the
support of Turkey's Erdogan and Hungary's Orban, [would]{.underline}
possibly [be]{.underline} one [characterised by competition over
cooperation, protectionism rather than free trade, authoritarianism
rather than democracy]{.underline}. Henceforth, evidence suggests that
the possible thawing of the liberal democratic world order could be
problematic to geopolitical security (Mounk, 2018:114).

An extension of this new global order and how it could potentially lead
to increased geopolitical security is that the Strongman's disregard for
democratic norms is contributing to a growing sense of license among
autocrats worldwide (Diamond, 2019:20). As more Strongmen come to power
and are able to enact their policies, their '[successful run' at
authoritarianism is making it easier for it to thrive
elsewhere]{.underline}. Albright (2018:246) argues that herd mentality
is powerful within international affairs and if one leader can follow a
specific form of leadership, other leaders around the world are likely
to observe and mimic. Thus, with growing assertiveness, disregard for
international law yet few consequences and increased economic success,
more leaders are turning towards the 'Strongman playbook'. Strongmen
such as Putin, Orban and Erdogan look to others for help in endorsing
their regime, favouring one's authoritarian adversaries over democratic
allies (Albright, 2018:246; Mounk, 2018:2). Nudging followers away from
the consensus and support for democratic norms, these leaders portray an
image that this type of illiberal, autocratic leadership is acceptable
(Lendvai, 2017:198). Once where a nation may have consistently held
another nation and its leadership in discontent, once in power, the
strongman may reverse this decision and instead seek to build a
trusting, cooperative relationship (Kearns, 2018:4). For instance,
despite the actions of some states towards the negation of human rights
and democracy, Russia under Putin has increasingly used its power status
to shield other authoritarian states from international demands to
protect human rights and block interventions that would force
governments to end abuses (Weiss, 2019:95). By allowing nations to
continue with their erosion of human rights and political freedoms of
its citizens without consequences, it signals to other authoritarian
states and Strongman leaders that their actions are acceptable. This
then can potentially lead to the possibility of an increased scale
across the globe of human rights abuses as autocratic states are not
fearful of harmful consequences. Henceforth, this could have serious
implications for geopolitical security as more states negate human
rights.

[When these actions come from democratic countries that have before been
strong advocates of democracy, this reversal can have a harmful
effect]{.underline} (Albright, 2018:218), particularly in countries
where there are already few checks on executive power. The issue with a
leader showing these characteristics, especially in a free, liberal and
democratic society, is that it signals to other leaders all over the
world with these autocratic tendencies are acceptable. If one leader can
argue that the press always lies, or the democratic institutions are
erroneous, it becomes difficult to fault another across the globe when
they make the same claim (Albright, 2018:5; Nance, 2018).

For example, on the invasion of the Ukraine and the illegal annexation
of Crimea, leaders across the globe praised Russia's decision. The
leader of the Hungarian fascist party Jobbik praised Putin and Greece's
Golden Dawn praised Russia for defending Ukraine from "ravens of
international usury" and France's Front National lauded Putin's
courageous position against the international lobby (Snyder, 2018:149).
With Putin's actions, and the endorsement he received from other
nations, the impression is given that breaking international laws and
sovereignty is acceptable.

Together, these Strongmen are creating an alliance of nations led by
strong authoritarian leaders who will increasingly pose a risk to the
liberal, democratic world order as democratic states fail to stand up to
this alliance or prove to be more successful (Lendvai, 2017:214; Nance,
2018). The current world order has not completely eroded but is
spearheaded by the rise of Strongmen into political power. The
possibility of a new global order emerges -- one that appears to create
significant geopolitical insecurity. While the Washington Consensus may
be faulted, it did help foster a global environment of cooperation and
consideration between states, while helping to promote the principles of
liberal democracy. [A stable world order requires a stable distribution
of power and broad acceptance of the rules that govern the conduct of
international relations]{.underline} (Haass, 2019:22). However, what the
Strongmen champion poses a risk to increased geopolitical insecurity as
their policies and ideologies are often centred on conflict,
isolationism and protectionism. Instead, they foster a world of
unbalanced power and the formulation of their own rules. Further, as
more and more nations create a coalition of Strongmen, [[it will become
increasingly difficult to not only stand up to them but also to foster
democracy and stability]{.underline}]{.mark} (Kazan & Park, 2019). In a
world of 'complex interdependence' (Rose, 2019:19), nations cannot fully
operate in isolation and such attitudes that fail to acknowledge this
and instead foster relationships based on self-interest can only create
instability.

GOVERNANCE, Global Priorities Project, 2017, p. 9-10\]

During the twentieth century, citizens of several nations lived for a
time under [extremely brutal and oppressive regimes. Between them, these
states killed more than one hundred million people, and sought total
control over their citizens.]{.underline} [Previous totalitarian states
have not been particularly durable]{.underline} chiefly [due to the
problem of ensuring orderly transition between leaders, and to external
competition from other more liberal and successful states]{.underline}.
However, [[there is a]{.mark} non-negligible [chance]{.mark} that [the
world will come to be dominated by]{.mark} one or a handful of
[totalitarian states. If this were to happen, external competition would
no longer threaten the durability of such states]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the same extent. Moreover, [improvements in certain forms of technology
may make it easier for totalitarian states to maintain control, for
example by making surveillance much easier]{.underline}. [[Global
totalitarianism could exacerbate other existential risks by reducing the
quality of governance.]{.mark} In addition, a long future under
[a]{.mark} particularly [brutal global totalitarian state
could]{.mark}]{.underline} arguably [[be worse than complete
extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}.

error that [[would leave the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited

home.]{.underline} [The last time an unraveling of an existing
international order occurred was]{.underline} in [the 1930s, and the
result was depression and world war]{.underline}. Indeed, much of the
violence and disorder we see in the world today results from the
weakening of the current order. Moreover, [the existing order must be
assessed relative to the plausible alternatives. The best case outcome
in light of an American retreat from the international order is a
spheres of influence system whereby China dominates much of East Asia,
Russia dominates much of Eastern and Central Europe, and the United
States is preeminent in its own hemisphere and possibly Western
Europe.]{.underline} Spheres of influence approaches to international
order are inherently unstable, largely because the lines of demarcation
are contested. [It is a configuration prone to great power conflict. And
the process of transition from an open global order where small nations
have rights to a more imperial model would be particularly
fraught.]{.underline}

counter or outright compete with the West militarily, technologically,
or economically. [By employing hybrid methods as part of an overarching
strategy of intimidation]{.underline}, however, [the Kremlin can have
significant influence over international affairs]{.underline}.4

[[Russia's hybrid toolkit is]{.mark} multi-level and often country
specific, which has made it [highly effective and difficult to
combat]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its most widely known example, Russia
used below-threshold force to illegally invade eastern Ukraine and annex
Crimea. The Kremlin has also used proxies and privately contracted
forces to influence the outcome of conflicts abroad, from Syria to
Libya. Other examples of Russia's low-level uses of force include
attempted assassinations of pro-Western leaders and the use of deadly
chemical attacks to target political enemies on foreign soil. In terms
of cyber and operational activities, [Russia has conducted reckless and
dangerous cyberattacks, infiltrated critical infrastructure]{.underline}
in the United States, and manipulated gas pipelines, electric grids, and
financial systems in Eastern Europe and beyond [to increase its leverage
abroad]{.underline}.

With respect to political subversion and economic coercion, [Russia has
interfered in elections]{.underline} in the United States and across
Europe [in attempts to divide transatlantic populations]{.underline} and
influence the outcomes toward candidates the Kremlin views as favorable
to Russia. Other tools and tactics include: bribing officials in foreign
countries; financing anti-European parties in Central and Eastern Europe
to promote pro-Russian narratives; and investing in strategic sectors in
foreign countries to maximize dependency on Russia. On the
information-warfare front, the Kremlin has orchestrated widespread
disinformation campaigns and strategic hack-and-release efforts designed
to sow doubt, create chaos, and sway public opinion in its favor on key
policy issues.

While Russian hybrid activities can be traced much further back than
these examples---including to the major cyberattacks in Estonia in 2007
and the Russo-Georgia conflict in 2008---they have been steadily
increasing since the Kremlin's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014.
Looking ahead, several elements could impact the future course of
Russia's hybrid actions. First are the constitutional changes that
Russian President Vladimir Putin has pushed through national courts to
reset presidential term limits.5 The reforms allow Putin to remain in
power until 2036, or possibly for life, pending a final national
referendum.6 With his grip on power soon to be cemented, Putin is likely
to attempt more aggressive hybrid actions, knowing the domestic
political risks for him are low.

Another factor is the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered a
global recession and a drastic decline in demand for oil so critical to
Russia's energy-reliant economy. In early 2020, Russia and Saudi Arabia,
the world's biggest crude producers, failed to agree to mutual
production cuts in response to the crisis, fueling a price war that
further hurt Russia's economy.7 Economic, public health, and social
pressures inside Russia could push the Kremlin to temporarily scale back
its ambitions in the short term. However, at the same time, uncertainty
and anxiety around the pandemic could create more fertile conditions for
Russia's hybrid activities beyond its borders, especially as
Euro-Atlantic governments take extraordinary domestic measures to
respond.8 In the long term---even as the pandemic subsides, oil prices
rebound, and the global economy begins to recover---conditions will
remain difficult for Russia, whose economy has suffered from stagnation
and sanctions from the West. These [dynamics may lead Putin to be more
assertive with hybrid strategies abroad with the aim of appealing to
nationalist sentiments at home in order to quell domestic political
tensions]{.underline}.

[[Further emboldening Putin is the lack of]{.mark} traditional
[US]{.mark} leadership and [pushback]{.mark} that has helped to keep
Russia in check]{.underline}. US President Donald Trump has instead
tried to appeal to Putin, describing his own policy as "getting along
with Russia" and reducing perceived or actual consequences of hybrid
actions against the United States. Political allegations of the Trump
campaign "colluding" with Russia to affect US elections9 have further
divided the American public toward Russian aims, creating more fertile
ground for the Kremlin's malign influence.10 Compounding this is fraying
transatlantic solidarity, whether the USGermany feud over defense
spending or French President Macron's comments that NATO is
"braindead."11 [These divisions not only constrain the West's response
to Russia's hybrid actions, but also expose cracks in the Alliance that
Putin is all too eager to exploit]{.underline}.

Together, these factors indicate that as long [as Putin remains in
power, the [Kremlin will likely continue escalating hybrid
activities]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} short of an all-out war with
NATO, [to push boundaries and test what is acceptable going
forward]{.underline}. In the relative near term, [the [transatlantic
community must plan according to Russia's current trajectory on hybrid
issues, which demands a more proactive and widespread
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The current moment feels so precarious because [[the]{.mark} key
[pillars of the old order are under strain]{.mark}]{.underline}. After
World War II, the United States sought to ensure its own freedom,
prosperity, and security by creating a larger international system in
which America and likeminded countries could flourish. That system,
commonly known as [the [liberal international]{.mark} order, required
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [to
bear extraordinary burdens. It also [delivered extraordinary benefits:
averting global wars]{.mark}]{.underline} of the sort that plagued the
early 20th century, [[lifting billions]{.mark} of people [out of
poverty, and creating an environment in which democratic values could
spread]{.mark}]{.underline} more widely than ever before. Yet [[that
system is now being challenged]{.mark} from without and
within]{.underline}.

[[An ambitious]{.mark}, totalitarian [China and a vengefully resurgent
Russia are expanding their influence]{.mark}]{.underline} at the expense
of America and its allies. [[Authoritarian models]{.mark} of governance
[are advancing]{.mark} and democracy is eroding]{.underline}. America's
own competence and commitment are in doubt, after the aggrieved
unilateralism of the Trump presidency and the debacle of Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, [[a witch's brew of polarization]{.mark}, tribalism, [and
surging domestic illiberalism have cast deep uncertainty]{.mark} over
the future]{.underline} of American democracy.

These domestic strains are troubling enough in their own right, but they
also have pernicious impacts on foreign affairs. After January 6, people
in many democratic countries believe that America's political system is
broken. The moral prestige that lubricates American global influence is
in shorter supply. American allies wonder about the prospect of a Trump
resurrection, and fear that extreme polarization will make U.S. foreign
policy erratic for years to come.

It is no surprise, then, that counsels of retrenchment have been
proliferating: Surely America will have to deal with its own demons
before it can deal with China, Russia, and a host of other rivals. Yet
[[if the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates

[[Corruption of the information ecosystem has become an **existential
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} to civilization as we know [it [because
prosperity and advancement depend on a secure information infrastructure
and environment that provides human beings with contextualized,
reliable, trustworthy]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation [when and where it is
needed]{.underline}. **[[Info]{.underline}]{.mark}**rmation [[is as much
a part of human ecology]{.mark} and the essence of being human [as
DNA]{.mark}]{.underline} (itself a form of information!) is a part of
the evolutionary processes in biological systems.

Today, [[chaos reigns in much of the]{.underline}]{.mark} information
[[ecosystem on which societies depend]{.underline}]{.mark}. In many
forums for political and societal discourse, national [leaders shout
about fake news, by]{.underline} which they mean information they do not
like. [These same leaders lie shamelessly,]{.underline} calling their
lies truth, or perhaps "truthful hyperbole." Acting across national
boundaries, these leaders and their surrogates exacerbate existing
divisions, creating rage and diminishing confidence in elections and
democratic institutions. Using unsupported anecdotes and sketchy
rhetoric, denialists undermine well-established science about climate
change and other urgent issues. Established institutions of the
government, journalism, and education -- institutions that have
traditionally provided stability -- are under attack precisely because
they have provided stability.

The founding of the Bulletin predates by several decades the widespread
availability of computers, the Internet, smart phones, search engines,
and social media. Few could imagine in 1945 a technological environment
that affords today's high-speed and widespread connectivity, high
degrees of anonymity, insensitivity to distance and national borders,
easy and customized information searches, democratized access to
publishing capabilities, inexpensive production and consumption of
information content (including and increasingly importantly emotionally
evocative video and audio content), disintermediation of established
information sources, and ubiquitous, always-on, always-available access
to information sources through mobile devices.

Such [advances in]{.underline} information **[tech]{.underline}**nology
[have heralded the arrival of the information age]{.underline}, a world
in which taking near-immediate advantage of information opens up
enormous opportunities in both the private and public sectors for
improved delivery of existing products and services and, perhaps more
important, the creation of entirely new products and services. Products
and services can be customized to individual needs and preferences on a
large scale and at more affordable costs. Transactional friction can be
tremendously reduced. Through the Internet of Things, actuators and
sensors can be connected to process control computers to optimize the
behavior and function of physical systems. Everywhere that information
can be used to create and improve new and existing functionality (that
is, essentially everywhere), one can find or imagine new information
technologies to do so.

At the same time, [advances in]{.underline} information
**[tech]{.underline}**nology [have a dark side. The same [increases in
the volume and velocity of information]{.mark} have created a louder and
more chaotic information environment that stimulates fast, angry,
reflexive, intuitive, and visceral thinking, reaction, and action in
people and thus [displaces more complex, reflective, and rational
thought]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a chaotic environment of information
overload, people are more likely to use mental shortcuts as a way to
reduce the cognitive burden that such an environment places on their
thinking.

In recent years, we have seen how the Internet, social media, and mobile
devices (and other technologies) can be used by foreign adversaries to
interfere in elections and to disrupt the democratic process. We have
seen:

● Social media exploitation of cognitive biases to increase their impact
and reach -- short messages of 280 characters and emotionally evocative
video/ audio clips are nearly ubiquitous and much more the norm than
they ever were two decades ago.

● Disintermediation of established information sources that reduces the
role and influence of those previously responsible for providing factual
information and proliferates information sources. The US Supreme Court
noted in Associated Press v. US (1945) that "the widest possible
dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is
essential to the welfare of the public, that a free press is a condition
of a free society." Today, modern information technology has enabled the
creation of a larger number of information sources than the 1945 US
Supreme Court could possibly have imagined.

● Search engines that return highly visible results for queries based in
large part on the popularity of those results and the inferred desires
of the user for specific information rather than their actual importance
to those queries. Such functionality also makes it easier than ever for
people to find information online "by doing their own research," thus
indulging in their confirmation biases by selectively finding and
attending only to information that confirms one's beliefs. Search engine
optimization techniques enable gaming of search algorithms to promote
the visibility of false, misleading, or worthless information. ●
Many-to-many connectivity that enables the formation of echo chambers
and media bubbles that reinforce pre-existing beliefs.

● Large-scale data mining that allows adversaries to sift huge amounts
of personal data on individuals to identify and target those most
susceptible to customized, inflammatory, false, malign, or misleading
messages -- and also to keep such messages away from public view.

● Near-immediate data transfer, which enables propaganda and other
malign information to spread far and wide quickly, while efforts to
correct false information are more expensive, often fall short, and
frequently fail altogether.

● Inauthentic voices that are largely indistinguishable from authentic
ones. Macedonian entrepreneurs discovered ways to monetize an affinity
of Trump voters for fake news (Subramanian 2017). Paid human employees
of the Internet Research Agency created and spread false information on
behalf of the Russian government prior to the 2016 U.S. election
(MacFarquhar 2018). And automated "bots"--accounts purportedly
associated with human users but in fact managed entirely or mostly by
machines -- add further chaos to the information environment.

Is this state of information affairs really new? Haven't adversaries of
all stripes always employed propaganda and lies -- otherwise known as
information warfare (or at least a big part of it) -- to advance their
interests?

Yes. Information warfare indeed has a long pedigree that reaches into
the past for at least the three millennia since the Trojan Horse enabled
Greek warriors to breach the walls around the city of Troy. Much more
recently, the rise of the Nazi regime in Germany relied on propaganda.
As Hitler (1925, 155--56) wrote:

\[I\]ts purpose must be . . . to attract the attention of the masses and
not by any means to dispense individual instructions to those who
already have an educated opinion on things or who wish to form such an
opinion on grounds of objective study -- because that is not the purpose
of propaganda, it must appeal to the feelings of the public rather than
to their reasoning powers. . . . The art of propaganda consists
precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through
an appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological
form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the
national masses. . . . The receptive powers of the masses are very
restricted, and their understanding is feeble.

But [more so today than at any earlier point in human history, [human
beings are vulnerable to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation [[warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}.
At the same time that [new information technologies have led to an
increase in the volume and velocity of information available on Earth by
many orders of magnitude]{.underline} in the past few decades, [the
cognitive architecture of the human mind is more or less unchanged on
the time scale of centuries or even millennia.]{.underline}

On human cognition

Research in the fields of cognitive and social psychology has formalized
what Hitler knew intuitively. We now understand that human [cognitive
processing capability is not unlimited; humans have finite cognitive
resources]{.underline} that can be "used up" under mentally stressful
circumstances. Findings from the same cognitive psychology that has
transformed neoclassical economics into behavioral economics (and
resulted in three Nobel Prizes in economics) have made clear the
"bounded rationality" of human thought and the simultaneous existence in
every individual of the capability to engage in two types of cognitive
processing.

Specifically, heuristic dual-system cognitive theory posits that [human
beings have two systems for cognitive processing]{.underline} -- an
[intuitive]{.underline}, reflexive, and emotionally driven mode of
thought (often designated as System 1) [and]{.underline} a slower, more
[deliberate]{.underline}, analytical mode of thought (often designated
as System 2). Kahneman (2011) provides a primer on System 1 and System 2
thinking. (See Petty and Cacioppo 1986; Chaiken 1987 for other variants
of dual-system cognitive theory; see Kruglanski and Thompson 1999 for a
contrary view on dual-system cognitive theory.)

System 1 is designed to operate rapidly, but it can do so because it
does not take account of all available information and is thus more
prone to error (also called bias). System 2 operates more slowly but is
more likely to take into account the available information and is less
prone to error. People engaging in System 1 information processing
respond more emotionally and less rationally or critically than in
System 2 processing.

Most important, System 1 thinking is the default mode of thought for
human beings -- it uses smaller amounts of cognitive resources, relies
on simple gutbased judgments, and is used more often when humans are
under stress. For most situations encountered in everyday life, System 1
thinking is adequate and produces mostly valid and useful outcomes, but
it often fails when a situation requires complex inferences for
understanding. For such situations, System 2 thinking, which is
effortful and consumptive of cognitive resources, is more often
appropriate -- and when individuals fail to use System 2 when it is
appropriate to do so, they are easily misled.

Most individuals are capable of both System 1 and System 2 thinking;
thus, the important operative question is the circumstances under which
they select one or the other type of thinking. Psychology has
accumulated considerable evidence relevant to this question.

For example, Taber and Lodge (2006) show that an individual tends to be
less critical of information that is favorable to his or her position
than of information that is not favorable -- that is, he or she is more
likely to engage in System 1 thinking for favorable information. People
have a confirmation bias in their information seeking and processing
behavior -- they preferentially seek out information that is consistent
with their beliefs and they are highly critical of (or ignore)
information that contradicts their beliefs. In a meta-analysis of 91
studies, Hart et al. (2009) considered two motivations for how an
individual might select information to consume -- the desire to gain an
accurate understanding of reality and the desire to feel validated in
his or her beliefs. These two motivations conflict when an accurate
understanding of reality does not validate one's beliefs, and such a
situation motivates the question of which of these motivations is more
powerful. Hart et al. concluded that both motivations drive human
informationseeking behavior, thus moderating each other to a certain
extent, but that on balance, humans do exhibit a tendency towards the
validation of their beliefs. People are also subject to belief
perseverance (a.k.a. a continuing influence effect) -- a cognitive bias
through which individuals do not revise beliefs based on erroneous
information even when they know for sure that such information is
erroneous (Lewandowsky et al. 2012).

Maintenance of an individual's social identity is an important influence
on his or her invocation of System 1 or System 2 thinking. Evidence
suggests that individuals tend to adopt the views of the peer groups
that are most salient to them, even if the "objective" or "factual"
information available to them contradicts those views. (Asch 1951
performed the classic "conformity experiments" that demonstrated this
phenomenon in the early 1950s.) Uncritical System 1 thinking is active
in processing information that is consonant with the beliefs and
attitudes of those peer groups. Critical and skeptical System 2 thinking
is active in processing information that is dissonant to those groups'
beliefs. These effects (that individuals tend to accept salient group
norms) are even more pronounced in an anonymous environment, such as
that which characterizes much online interaction (Postmes et al. 2001).

Lastly, there is evidence that [emotion and motivation affect
cognition]{.underline}. For example, people who are angry tend to rely
more heavily on simple heuristic cues (suggestive of System 1 thinking)
than those who are not angry (Bodenhausen, Sheppard, and Kramer 1994).
Individuals are more likely to stereotype people (a form of System 1
thinking) when that stereotype is consistent with their desired
impression of those people; conversely, when the stereotype is
inconsistent with their desired impression, individuals tend to inhibit
the use of this stereotype (Kunda and Sinclair 1999). Negative emotions
(such as those induced by the receipt of information incongruent with a
person's prior beliefs) can improve the ability of a person to reason
logically, thus enabling him or her to negate or discount that
information (Goel and Vartanian 2011).

[In the new]{.underline} information [environment, exploitation of human
cognitive architecture and capabilities]{.underline} -- which are
largely unchanged from what existed millennia ago -- [provides the 21st
century]{.underline} information [warrior with cyber-enabled
capabilities]{.underline} that Hitler, Stalin, Goebbels, and McCarthy
could have only imagined. By [exploiting cognitive limitations, the
perpetrators of cyber-enabled information warfare have learned to
exacerbate prejudices, biases, and ideological differences; to add heat
but no light to political discourse]{.underline}; and to spread widely
believed "alternative facts" in advancing their political positions.

Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election has dominated
news headlines ever since. But interference by authoritarian countries
in the elections of democratic states -- as undesirable and threatening
as it may be -- is hardly the only negative consequence of cyber-enabled
information warfare. The problems of nuclear war and climate change are
hard enough to solve even when well-intentioned, well-informed parties
on all sides share a basic understanding and knowledge of the relevant
facts. Yes, they may have different values and different priorities, may
act under different constraints, and be able to bring to bear different
levels of resources to these problems.

But without shared, fact-based understandings of the blast, thermal, and
radiation effects of nuclear explosions, what hope is there for national
leaders to reach agreements to reduce the threat of nuclear holocaust
\[war\] or to make good decisions about nuclear weapons use in times of
crisis? Without shared, fact-based understandings that rising
atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations caused by human beings result
in corresponding increases in global temperature and climatic
disruption, what hope is there for national leaders to reach agreements
to begin serious efforts at decarbonizing their economies?

Climate change denialism

Climate change denialism can be fairly characterized as cyber-enabled
information warfare against the reality of large-scale
anthropogenically-induced climate change. In the responses of people
resistant to taking action to mitigate climate change, we see a number
of psychological factors at work (Zaval and Cornwell 2016). For example,
one key element of System 1 thinking is the availability heuristic, with
which individuals tend to associate the likelihood of an event with the
ease with which they can remember similar events in the past. But the
long-term consequences of climate change are unprecedented in recorded
human history and obviously people have no personal memories of
unprecedented events.

Moreover, climate change is a long-term process whose inexorable
progression is easily masked by short-term fluctuations in local weather
conditions. For example, public concerns about climate changes correlate
with local weather conditions (Krosnick et al. 2006). Climate change
deniers are also quick to flag for public attention days that are
particularly cold as "evidence" that global warming is not occurring and
thus, they claim, discrediting theories of climate change. This
illustrates a bias known as attribute substitution, as Kahneman and
Frederick (2002) describe, through which individuals substitute salient
information (such as the cold temperature today) for information that is
more relevant but harder to understand (such as information about global
climate change).

People are also subject to a loss-aversion bias, in which they place
greater weight on losses than gains of equal value. In 1992, the United
States committed itself to the United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change, although President George HW Bush also stated that "the
American way of life is not up for negotiation" -- and in 2018, the
United States withdrew from the Paris Agreement (which was based on the
convention). The argument? That the United States would have to give up
too much if it kept to the agreement.

To close this (merely illustrative) exploration of biases relevant to
climate change denialism, the optimism bias suggests that people
consider themselves exceptions when considering the likelihood of a
negative event occurring. That is, bad things may happen to other
people, but they won't happen to me, even though I and those other
people are similar in important and relevant ways. In a climate context,
the bad things may involve sea level rise or heat waves -- and the
misperception that "others may suffer from such problems but I won't"
diminishes the power of personal concern as a driver for rational
decision making.

Connecting the operation of these cognitive biases to the affordances of
modern information technologies is not difficult. For example, Roxburgh
et al. (2019) demonstrate how the characteristics of specific weather
events (e.g. hurricanes or snowstorms) and "short-term socio-political
context can play a critical role in determining the lenses through which
climate change is viewed." Note especially the importance of "short-term
socio-political context" -- precisely the context that social media
shapes.

Elsasser and Dunlap (2013) noted the influential role of a variety of
newspaper columnists in advancing denialist arguments and thus
amplifying these arguments to a broad segment of the American public.
Fewer in number then, essentially all columnists today (of all political
leanings) have a social media presence that they use to publicize their
work, and in many instances their online presence is driven in
significant part by social media and reach many more readers online than
in print. Furthermore, subtleties and nuances in their extended written
pieces are likely to be lost when they are represented in social media.

Another important element of climate change denialism is the easy
accessibility of seemingly-authoritative information that casts doubt on
the well-established science of climate change. As reported by The
Guardian, a variety of largely secret funding sources distributed \$118
million to 102 denialist organizations (Goldenberg 2013). Oreskes and
Conway (2011) provide the definitive work on deliberate information
campaigns to obscure the scientific truth on a range of issues from
smoking to climate change. These denialist organizations have generated
a variety of products for public and policy consumption (but --
unsurprisingly -- not many peer-reviewed scientific articles) that are
easily accessible to the public, mainstream media outlets, and policy
makers. Their products are broadly disseminated through social media and
easily found through customized search, and they are sought by reporters
who seeking to cover "both sides" of a controversy that is
intellectually equivalent to a "controversy" about whether the earth is
round or flat.

Nuclear conflict

On the risks of nuclear conflict, theories and approaches to nuclear
deterrence and strategic stability developed prior to the collapse of
the Soviet Union in the late 1980's and early 1990's rest on the
presumption of rationality in national decision makers. In particular,
they assume that adversaries are deterred from attacking by a threat of
retaliation that would impose costs on the adversary that would outweigh
any conceivable benefits that it would gain from an attack (Morgan
2003). Central to this assumption is a rational adversary that can and
does make a calculation of expected costs and benefits, compares them,
and then acts accordingly.

But the psychologically informed understanding of realworld decision
making described above was not accepted widely in the scientific
literature until approximately the same time as the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the seminal work in such understanding occurred only
in the decade previous to that. What a psychologically-informed
understanding of real-world decision making tells us is that the
rationality assumption at the base of much traditional thinking on
deterrence and strategic stability is untenable, given that humans have
evolved to rely on intuitive, reflexive, heuristic System 1 thinking to
make decisions, particularly when faced with time pressures, surprise
and other obstacles to the deliberate calculation implied by System 2
thinking (Kahneman 2011). Psychology tells us that -- more often than
not -- the fast, intuitive judgements of System 1 often take precedence
over the slower, more analytical thinking of System 2.

The challenges posed by reflexive reliance on System 1 thinking are
greatly accentuated by characteristics of today's information
environment. Social media networks in particular are optimally designed
to stimulate System 1 thinking -- emotional, reflexive, immediate -- and
they rapidly transmit content among like-minded individuals, creating
the ideal conditions for public polarization and divisiveness to occur
(Pfeffer, Zorbach, and Carley 2014). Multiple narratives rapidly emerge
around complex events; citizens splinter into their own informational
universes and are unable to agree on an underlying reality. Political
leaders themselves are subject to these conflicting narratives and may
even be active and influential participants in one or another of them.

It is thus easy to posit that in this information environment,
manipulated information -- either artificially constructed or adopted by
a strong grassroots base -- could be used by interested parties to
generate pressure on leaders to act. At the same time, leaders
themselves are likely to be facing information overload and less able to
distinguish analyzed information from their own intelligence sources and
other, unvetted information originating from their constituencies.

The coming information dystopia

Nuclear war and climate change are arguably the most important
existential challenges today that are compounded by the corruption of
the information ecosystem. But [even if a single miraculous stroke the
laws of physics were changed to make nuclear weapons impossible to build
and operate and to immediately eliminate anthropogenic emissions at zero
cost, cyber-enabled information warfare could still can lead to an
information dystopia]{.underline}. Here are some possible elements:

● Adversaries manufacture numerous graphic videos of American soldiers
(complete with sound effects) committing battlefield atrocities, and
spread them widely through the Internet. Once upon a time, highquality
video forgeries were difficult and expensive to make. AI-based
technologies will bring this socalled deepfake capability to the masses,
and anyone with imagination, a modicum of technical skill, and a
personal computer will be able to distribute reasonably realistic
forgeries. Denials will be issued but of course will also not be
believed by large fractions of viewers. Even if proof of inauthenticity
can be provided, such evidence will not affect the responses of many

● Political campaigns conduct similar efforts to discredit political
opponents (e.g. "showing" an opponent making controversial or
disqualifying remarks before an election). But they also use the
existence of deepfake technologies to deflect attention from authentic
and real evidence of their own political and personal misdeeds. For
example, a real video of a candidate punching an old lady who supports
his opponent will be dismissed as "one of those deepfakes that anyone
could have produced."

● Financial markets are disrupted by falsified videos of CEOs making
announcements regarding company prospects that are much more pessimistic
than expected. Attempts to correct the record are drowned out in a
subsequent flood of contradictory information, all of which appear at
first glance to be authentic.

● Public safety is compromised by reports of local disasters (e.g.
explosions of chemical plants that result in the release large amounts
of toxic gases). These reports, along with "authentic" video of people
choking amidst locally familiar locations (e.g. well-known fields or
sport stadiums), cause spontaneous mass evacuations. Contradictory
directions for evacuation broadcast using social media result in chaos
on the streets and highways.

● Public health is placed at risk when the safety and efficacy of
medical treatments known to be safe and effective are publicly
questioned through active disinformation campaigns conducted on the
Internet and in bookstores. Attempts to provide valid information are
met with responses such as "that's what the pharmaceutical companies and
medical establishment want you to think, but just look at what's
happened to our children."

● Children in schools are threatened by online campaigns to spread
rumor, innuendo, and positive or negative information about various
students. Conducting such campaigns for pay becomes the business model
of entrepreneurs who advertise that they can guarantee admission to
selective colleges, boost the social standing of the children of their
clients, or take revenge on those who have harmed such children, all in
anonymous and untraceable ways.

● Journalists, political leaders, and judges are compromised by artfully
forged emails and alterations to other documents that are mixed with
entirely authentic leaked emails and documents and are indistinguishable
from them.

[A world with these elements]{.underline} -- and many more comparable
ones -- [will be the inevitable result if and when deployment and use of
the tools of cyber-enabled]{.underline} information [warfare become
widespread]{.underline}. And even more troubling is the fact that not
every bit of information needs to be corrupted for this dystopian
outcome to occur -- it will require only a fraction of it to be
corrupted for people to lose faith entirely in "objective" and
"trustworthy" sources of information, the result of which will be that
people will fractionate into their own information realities.

Fearing the end of the enlightenment

The Enlightenment established reason and reality as the foundational
pillars of civilized discourse. In such discourse, logic matters, and a
logical contradiction between statement A and statement B means that at
least one of those statements is false. The truth of a statement about
the world is tested by its correspondence to objective reality rather
than by how many people believe it; that is, empirical data are
influential. Furthermore, statements known to be wrong or false do not
affect conclusions or choices between alternative courses of action.

[[Cyber-enabled]{.underline} **[info]{.underline}**]{.mark}rmation
[[warfare provides the tactics]{.mark}, tools, and
procedures]{.underline} -- in short, the means -- [[to replace]{.mark}
the pillars of logic, [truth,]{.mark} and reality [with fantasy, rage,
and fear. In a world of]{.mark} ubiquitous cyber-enabled]{.underline}
information [[warfare]{.underline},]{.mark} [communication and
[information inflame passions]{.mark}]{.underline} [rather]{.mark} than
informing reason, [play to the worst in people's cognitive architectures
rather than the best, [and divide]{.mark} rather than unify. Deliberate
corruption of the information ecosystem could be seen as an analog of
poisoning water suppli]{.underline}es that can be done remotely,
inexpensively, and anonymously. All of this is just another way of
saying that [today [it is possible to see]{.mark} glimmerings of [an
anti-Enlightenment that can]{.mark} possibly [take root and]{.mark} that
would indeed be the **[end]{.mark}** of
**[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline} as we know it.

\*\*edited for language

Most European populists don't want to kill the European Union anymore.
This has perhaps been the most concrete consequence of Brexit, which has
made exiting the body much less appealing. In the recent European
Parliament election, not a single party put exiting the European Union
at the top of its priority list. Rather, the major [[European populist
parties]{.underline}]{.mark}, from France to Italy to Hungary, now
[[want to]{.mark} use their power]{.underline} in the new European
Parliament [to [**transform** the]{.mark} **[E]{.mark}**uropean
**[U]{.mark}**nion [from the **inside**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
feasibility of such an endeavor is, of course, questionable, given how
much the agendas of the various countries' populist parties differ,
especially on migration and fiscal issues.

The key outcome of the election was not necessarily a populist surge but
the decline of the center-left and center-right parties, in the context
of a huge rise in voter participation (over 50 percent, compared to 43
percent in the previous 2014 election). The center-left party S&D (Group
of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats) got 150 seats
(down from 187), the center-right party European People's Party (or
Christian Democrats) 179 (down from 216). The populist forces (whose
political group is still in the process of being created) will hold 73
seats, and 102 if we include the United Kingdom's Brexit party, which
received fewer votes than expected. In this context, the role of
"kingmaker" will be probably played by a new centrist coalition
aggregating the liberal votes of ALDE (Alliance of Liberals and
Democrats for Europe) and those of Macron's "Renaissance" list (up to
107 seats). But, like the populist forces, this new centrist coalition
will be divided on key issues such as budgetary discipline. Defining an
operational political platform among this group's members could be
highly problematic.

In a nutshell, [the parliament emerging from the elections is more
fragmented and less likely to build stable coalitions than
before]{.underline} --- even if two-thirds of the seats ultimately went
to pro-European parties. We can expect lengthy discussions among the
factions over the nomination of the European Commission president, who
is supposed to be from the party that obtained the largest number of
votes. If the EPP and the S&D agreed with this rule, the centrists of
ALDE and Macron's list firmly oppose it. In the longer term and
particularly when it comes to foreign policy, some ad hoc coalitions on
specific issues, like trade agreements and commercial policy more
generally, could be expected. Still, if the rise in voter turnout is
good news for European democracy, [the **[volatility]{.mark}** of
coalitions [is less welcome news for European foreign policy and]{.mark}
for the **[E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion's [capacity to act as a
**global player**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The **major risk** is]{.mark} probably [of **stalling** E.U.
policymaking by **blocking**]{.mark} the possibility of
[compromise]{.mark}]{.underline} that is at the heart of any E.U.
policy. [[That would risk further strengthening nationalist
governments,]{.mark} and further [undermining]{.mark} European citizens'
[confidence in European institutions]{.mark}, by proving their major
talking point: that the European Union is an inefficient
bureaucracy]{.underline} unable to protect them. Thus, [the [most
dangerous outcome of populist influence]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the
European Parliament [is that the **E**uropean **U**nion will
become]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~ \[[frozen]{.underline}
\][and]{.underline}]{.mark} [irrelevant on the international
scene,]{.underline} assuming the European populists are not able to
develop a coherent project aimed at founding an alternative European
Union. [If the E.U. decision-making process is]{.underline}
~~paralyzed~~ \[[frozen]{.underline} \], [[it will stall the
union's]{.mark} [historical role in multilateral forums]{.mark} and
further undermine confidence in the European project. [The very
relevance of the]{.mark} **[E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion --
[and of multilateralism as a way of enacting policy change --- is at
stake]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Multilateral cooperation is the only way to solve existential threats---even imperfect solutions are critical

[The future feels more]{.underline} threatening and [ominous than
ever.]{.underline} The sense of doom and gloom is deepening, not least
in the West. The daily news headlines do not help. We are told that
[[tensions between the US and North Korea, Iran, Russia or China could
flare-up into a global conflagration.]{.underline}]{.mark}

We are informed that the rise of AI will eliminate most jobs and
potentially humans. [We are witnessing how [social media is]{.mark}
dividing societies and [undermining liberal
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [we are reminded almost hourly about
how [climate change is leading to mass extinction.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Any one of these issues is enough to make us throw in the towel in
despair. That would be precisely the wrong thing to do. [While
[these]{.mark}]{.underline} and other [[threats are real]{.mark} and
daunting, none of them are]{.underline} absolutely
[guaranteed]{.underline}. In fact, [the only certainty we have in an era
of exponential change is the guarantee that our future is
uncertain]{.underline}.

This unremarkable insight is hardly cause for celebration. And it is
most definitely not a call for complacency. If anything, [it is a
reminder that we have the responsibility to do everything we possibly
can to build a world that prevents these calamitous events from
occurring]{.underline}.

Some modesty is called for. The truth is that we have never been
particularly good at predicting the future. To the contrary, some of our
smartest thinkers have been extremely good at getting things
spectacularly wrong.

For more than a century social scientists have missed the \"big events\"
that changed the course of history. Most of them were stunned by the
start of the First and Second World Wars, shocked by the end of the end
of the Cold War, and caught unawares with everything from 9/11 to the
2008 financial meltdown, the Arab Spring, Brexit and the election of
Donald Trump. It is important to acknowledge our limited capacity for
prognostication and adjust our behaviour and expectations accordingly.

Back in 1989, the future looked bright and promising. Liberal democracy
and market capitalism had prevailed. The US was the lonely super power.
Few analysts anticipated the spectacular rise of China and India much
less the explosive market turmoil in 1997 and 2008, the return of
reactionary nationalism and the rise of anti-globalism. And yet what is
astonishing is how quickly all this tumult has been accepted not just as
if it were inevitable, but that it constitutes the \"new normal\".

So is the future dark and dystopian as growing numbers of westerners --
especially Americans and Europeans -- are inclined to believe? The
answer is it might be, but this is far from a foregone conclusion.

It is worth underlining that people living in the west and the east have
never had it so good. While hard to believe, across virtually every
metric of human progress we are living the best years of the roughly
200,000 year history of homo sapiens. And [despite recent signs of
push-back against globalization and democracy, there has never been more
global cooperation or a larger number of people living in democratic
countries in history.]{.underline}

[[To survive]{.mark} the next century, [even more]{.mark} global
[cooperation is **essential**]{.mark}. [Going it alone is not an option.
The only way to tackle the biggest existential threats is for nation
states]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with companies, cities and civil
societies, [[to]{.mark} develop common understandings]{.underline} of
their shared challenges [and [work together]{.mark} to craft pragmatic
solutions]{.underline}. The 2030 Sustainable Development Goals are a
positive expression of global collaboration, a reminder of our awesome
potential for collective action.

We must advance ambitious, innovative and radical ideas. But [[we should
simultaneously reform]{.mark} and renew, rather than abandon,
[international institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, from the United
Nations and World Trade Organization to the G20 and development banks,
including new ones like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
[[Effective cooperation requires reinforcing]{.mark}, not weakening,
regional [alliances and arrangements]{.mark} as the world transitions to
a multi-polar order.]{.underline}

[[There is no shortage of]{.mark} daunting [existential global dangers
that]{.mark} require multilateral responses. These [range from]{.mark}
radical action to mitigate and adapt to [climate change, to]{.mark}
regulating [AI an]{.mark}d the proliferation of
**[w]{.mark}**]{.underline}eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction.

[The priority list is long and growing, including ensuring inclusive
growth and reducing gaping inequalities, [preventing
pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline} and superbugs, [regulating genetic and
biological engineering, [developing rules to manage cyber]{.mark}
security, managing migration and refugee flows and ensuring enforceable
trade rules for the 21st Century global economy]{.underline}. Yes, the
world is more complex and messier than in the past. Get used to it.

The business of building global cooperation has never been easy. It
requires a common baseline of facts, the ability to understand the
viewpoints of the \"other\", enlightened leadership and the forging of
trust to achieve collective responses that may well be sub-optimal.

It requires the foresight and wisdom to operate not just in the
national, but also the regional and international interest. At a time of
digitally-enabled fake news, sharpening polarization, and rising
populism, this is not straightforward. But when all citizens everywhere
are facing potentially civilization-ending threats, multilateralism is
not an option -- it is a necessity.

More than ever, [we must strive to achieve optimum solutions while
recognizing that the outcomes will almost certainly be imperfect, and it
may sometimes feel like we are muddling through. But like it or not,
[good enough global cooperation is key to our common
survival]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Hybrid Impact: Multilateralism / Populism---Economy Impact

#### Populism causes economic turmoil and erodes democratic checks and balances

[[Our evidence points to significant medium- and long-term economic
costs of populism]{.underline}]{.mark}, [while we find no decline in
income inequality. Fifteen years after the start of a populist episode,
the [average level of real GDP]{.mark}]{.underline} per capita and
consumption [[is more than 10 percentage points
lower]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to a synthetic placebo
counterfactual of countries without populists in power. Interestingly,
the decline in GDP growth in history (pre-1990) is driven by left-wing
populists that emphasize distributional and social issues, [while in
recent decades it is increasingly driven by right-wing populists whose
rhetoric typically focuses on cultural and religious topics. A clear
result is that [both variants of populism are equally bad for the
economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Declining economic fortunes under populists are a robust result that
we find to hold regardless of region, era, or
ideology.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is true in samples that exclude Latin
America, in a contemporary and historical sample, and for left- and
right-wing populists. This core finding is also robust to cases
involving the World Wars or specific outlier cases marked by
hyperinflation, civil war, and other extreme events[. We can equally
rule out that economic disruptions, such as financial crises, in the
years before the populist gains power drive the economic decline under
populist leaders.]{.underline}

When exploring the channels, [[three explanations are supported by the
data: First, economic nationalism]{.mark}, in particular protectionist
trade and investment policies. Import tariffs rise on average ten
percentage points]{.underline} compared to the non-populist
counterfactual. [[Populists typically deliver on their promises of
fostering economic nationalism and protectionism]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Rodrik 2018, Guiso et al. 2018), but with high costs. Second, [[there
is evidence for unsustainable macroeconomic
policies]{.underline},]{.mark} similar to the original discussion by
Dornbusch and Edwards (1991). [Fiscal policy often does not satisfy an
inter-temporal budget constraint as populist governments typically do
not react to rising debt ratios by adjusting the primary
balance,]{.underline} thereby putting debt dynamics on an unsustainable
path (Bohn 1998). [Third, [democratic checks and balances
declin]{.mark}e, the independence of the judiciary and press freedoms
often fall after populists come to power. [Functioning democratic
institutions contribute to long-term growth through innovation,
economies of scale, education, and capital
accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Acemoglu et al. 2005, 2019).
[Populism erodes these institutional advantages of
democracies.]{.underline}

### Hybrid Impact: Multilateralism / Populism---War Impact

#### Unchecked populism threatens global stability

**Drezner, Tufts University Interational Politics Professor, '17**

\[Daniel, Professor, International Politics, Tufts University, "The
Angry Populist as Foreign Policy Leader: Real Change or Just Hot Air,"
FLETCHER FORUM OF WORLD AFFAIRS v.41 n. 2, Summer 2017, p. 29-34\]

[[Leaders who rise to power]{.mark} in lower-probability scenarios
[are]{.mark} also [likely to have a greater appetite for risk]{.mark} in
foreign affairs]{.underline}. This matters, as Jeff Colgan notes: "risk
tolerance leads to aggression in international affairs because it
increases the perceived payoff of risky gambles."17 Populist leaders
more closely resemble revolutionaries than more established politicians.
And as Colgan warns, "the [[ambition]{.underline}]{.mark} of
revolutionary leaders also [[contributes to aggression]{.mark}. Ambition
makes it more likely that a leader will reject the status quo
internationally as well as domestically.]{.underline}"18 We can see this
kind of ambition on display among elected populists. Hugo Chávez
persistently proposed radical alternatives to the Washington Consensus.
One longtime friend of Viktor Orbán noted, "he has always wanted to
upset the status quo, to become a change-maker."19 Orbán himself, in a
meeting with Polish Law and Justice Party head Jaroslaw Kaczynski,
proposed a "cultural counter-revolution" in Europe.20 Donald Trump's
inaugural address categorically rejected the postwar liberal order,
arguing in favor of an "America First" approach to international
relations. Populists are therefore more likely to pursue high-risk,
revisionist foreign policies.

[[Populist]{.underline}]{.mark} leaders also care about recognition by
others, and will be quick to anger if that recognition is not
forthcoming. Populists build their legitimacy on their support from
"their" people, but part of that [[support comes from displays of
dominance]{.mark} over others]{.underline}. Russian president Vladimir
Putin is well-known for his over-the-top efforts to look strong and
powerful. These range from his shirtless photos to videos of him
weightlifting to scoring eight goals in an exhibition game with former
NHL All-Stars.21 In Erdoğan's first two years as Turkey's president, the
government has prosecuted more than 1,800 cases of Turkish citizens
insulting him---including a former Miss Turkey.22 Donald Trump has
insulted anyone who has criticized him since he started running for
president, ranging from erstwhile GOP rivals to federal judges to media
outlets to a former Miss Universe to Meryl Streep.

When dealing with domestic rivals and critics, such [displays of
dominance are an easy strategy for elected leaders to pursue. Populist
leaders engage in such behavior to project their strength and mastery
over the political fates]{.underline}. It is tricky to do this on the
international stage, however. Populist leaders will therefore be more
concerned than most politicians about the personal respect afforded to
them by others. At the international level, this leads to one of two
outcomes: recognition by other heads of state, or a denunciation of
leaders who fail to confer such recognition. If populists cannot exploit
the respect conferred by others, they will be quick to reject and
delegitimize the leaders who spurn them.

We can see this kind of pattern at work in how populist leaders have
reacted to setbacks on the global stage. Vladimir Putin began his tenure
in office with a much warmer attitude towards the West. During the first
decade of this century, however, Putin lost an ally during Ukraine's
Orange Revolution, and witnessed NATO expanding to Russia's borders. It
was at this point that Putin began adopting a more hostile attitude
towards the West. After President Obama cancelled a meeting with
Duterte, the Filipino president responded with a series of tirades
insulting the American president.23 In Trump's first week as president,
he faced pushback from the Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto on his
policies for the southern border. In response, Trump tweeted that Peña
Nieto should not bother coming to Washington. The Mexican president
responded by canceling his visit.

Populists do not possess a monopoly on anger in politics, but most
[populists tend to project anger as part of their leadership
style]{.underline}. Based on their pathway to power and their philosophy
of governance, it should not be surprising that they are commonly
associated with that emotion. As previously noted, populist parties do
particularly well after financial crises. They are adept at exploiting
the (often justified) anger that voters possess towards authorities that
were in charge when the crisis happened. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage
warned of "political anger" if the United Kingdom did not follow through
on Brexit. In a press conference blasting the United States, Duterte
said, "If you Americans are angry with me, then I am also angry with
you."24 During one of the GOP primary debates, Donald Trump explicitly
stated, "I will gladly accept the mantle of anger." Trump famously
refuses to apologize when he makes controversial or problematic
statements.25 Numerous press reports suggest that Trump lost his temper
with the Australian prime minister in their first phone conversation.

This wave of populist anger reverses a centuries-long western effort to
contain that emotion in international relations.26 Recent scholarship on
emotions in world politics suggest that sustained levels of anger carry
risks in world politics. Anger was valorized in societies with strong
honor cultures and warrior castes, biologically conditioning citizens
towards that feeling. Furthermore, as Neta Crawford notes, "threats that
evoke anger (if they are associated with perceived insults) tend to
decrease the perception of a threat and simultaneously heighten
risk-taking behaviors on the part of those who feel angry."27 This is
particularly true if populist leaders find ways to institutionalize
anger and resentment through new laws, executive orders, or bureaucratic
structures.

This tendency towards angry rhetoric can be exaggerated through
misperception and mistranslation. Conventional foreign policy leaders
are prepped to stay within the lanes of "accepted" diplomatic discourse,
so that observers can detect subtle shifts in phrasing as a foreign
policy signal. In contrast, populists scorn diplomatic language as
exercises in sophistry and hypocrisy. They rely on language designed to
appeal to their base, which increases the likelihood that outside
observers misconstrue their words. Angry tirades from leaders like
Trump, Duterte, or Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad have been
mistranslated---and usually in a direction that paints the leader as
more bellicose than intended.28 Populist leaders will be reluctant to
correct such misperceptions, because that would require them to engage
in the diplomatic discourse they have derided.

Displays of righteous indignation might play well with a populist
leader's domestic base. [[The international effect]{.underline}]{.mark}
of angry outbursts, however, [[is to narrow]{.mark} the zone of
[cooperation between countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} If a leader
unleashes an angry tirade against another country, that is sure to gain
considerable public attention in both nations. This automatically raises
the "audience costs" for both leaders. The larger the audience that is
paying attention to any dispute, the greater the political costs a
leader can suffer if they back down in that dispute.29 Displays of
temper make it harder for the populist to compromise, but it will also
make it more politically difficult for the object of the tirade to make
any concessions. Through effects on leaders and populations,
[[provocations make negotiations]{.mark} more [costly and]{.mark}
conflict [escalation more likely]{.mark}.]{.underline}30

Perhaps the most important intellectual trait that populist leaders
share is their tendency to think like hedgehogs. According to the
classical Greek poet Archilochus, "a fox knows many things, but a
hedgehog one important thing." Isaiah Berlin popularized that quote,
arguing that intellectuals could be divided into foxes and hedgehogs.
This works for decision-makers as well. Foxes will possess the necessary
metacognition to adapt to new facts and new circumstances; hedgehogs
will rely on their core beliefs, fitting the world into their
preexisting worldview.31 Populists are hedgehogs: the one big thing that
they know is to reject the elites and technocrats who heretofore
governed their country.

As Philip Tetlock observed more than a decade ago, foxes and hedgehogs
have different strengths when it comes to thinking about the world.32
Foxes are much better than hedgehogs in their predictive accuracy about
world events; simply put, foxes are better at incorporating new
information and updating how they think about the world. Hedgehogs are
better than foxes at anticipating big and unexpected events happening in
the world, such as the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, and the 2008 financial crisis. Anticipating those events
requires an assuredness about the way the world works that hedgehogs are
more likely to possess.

The effects of these different intellectual styles on foreign policy are
straightforward. As hedgehogs, populists are more likely to have their
expectations confounded in world politics. At the same time, populist
foreign policy leaders will face psychological and domestic political
barriers to admitting error or reversing a failing policy. Any public
recognition of a misstep demonstrates a leader's fallibility---which is
problematic for leaders who claim that they can divine the general will
of the people. At the same time, as hedgehogs, populists will be
reluctant to take any action that deviates from the way that they think
the world works.

Stepping back, we can proffer some tentative predictions of how populist
foreign policy leaders will behave in the coming years.
[[Populist]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign policy [l[eaders]{.mark} are
likely to [reject the pre-existing liberal international
order]{.mark}]{.underline} and espouse a strong form of ethnic
nationalism. They might try to create alternative international
arrangements to the status quo, but these efforts are likely to be
Potemkin efforts, with more pomp and circumstance than substance.
[Populist leaders will have greater appetites for risk and ambition on
the global stage.]{.underline} These heads of state will crave
recognition from their fellow world leaders, and be quick to anger if
they are spurned in this area. These displays of anger could become
institutionalized and will increase the audience costs of all the
involved actors, making cooperation less likely. And populists are less
likely to correctly perceive how the world works, and more likely to
hold firm with policies that are not viewed as working terribly well.

One disturbing conclusion to draw from this particular constellation of
traits is that populist leaders are more likely to foment international
crises. [[Breaking with pre-existing global governance structures can
guarantee]{.mark} a **[crisis escalation]{.mark}**. [An international
crisis can trigger rally-round-the flag effects]{.mark} within the
domestic population and make it easier for a leader to suppress
domestic]{.underline} dissent. At the extreme, [[one could envision
populists]{.mark} threatening or [launching **diversionary
wars**]{.mark}]{.underline} to appeal to a nationalist base in times of
trouble. Vladimir Putin employed this tactic. In early 2014, he was
still reeling from protests over his return to the Russian presidency,
and a slowdown in the Russian economy. He responded by annexing the
Crimea after the fall of his ally in Ukraine, and bankrolling a
secessionist conflict in Eastern Ukraine. These efforts caused his
public support to skyrocket even though the Russian economy contracted
in 2014 and 2015.

It should be stressed that these are all probabilistic statements. Many
of these traits are hardly unique to populists; other heads of state are
likely to display some subset of these leadership traits. Still, [this
combination of attributes suggest that the world is experiencing an

### Hybrid Impact: Russia War

#### NATO-Russia hybrid war escalates---it is an existential threat

There are multiple ways [[cyber conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} around the
Ukrainian invasion [[might escalate into a direct conflict between
Russia and NATO]{.mark}, possibly as a result of either side's
offensives.]{.underline}

First, [[Russian offensive cyber operations might spark a wider
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. President Vladimir Putin has declared
sanctions "are akin to a declaration of war" and may see aggressive
cyber attacks as the perfect response, particularly since they are
reversible and non-lethal. Russia has been entangled with Western
economies for decades, especially in the realms of energy and finance.
But now, as ties are being severed quickly and viciously, Russia no
longer has to fear the backlash if its cyber forces were to disrupt
Western banks or liquified natural gas terminals. If you are dealt out
of the game, why not just flip the table?

[Russia's cyber generals may be just as enthusiastic as their Army
counterparts]{.underline}. They may assure Putin their forces are ready
for battle and can quickly and bloodlessly get the West to back down.
Putin could be convinced disruptive attacks against the West are no big
deal, a low-cost signal that the West should de-escalate or just the
next natural move in a non-escalatory intelligence contest. After all,
U.S. research found that in response to cyber attacks, "Americans are
less likely to support retaliation with force" compared to a more
traditional strike.

[[This can lead to escalation in two ways]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates ---
along with countries like the United Kingdom, France, and the
Netherlands --- [[might]{.mark} well [decide to defend forward]{.mark}
against such attacks]{.underline}. Gen. Paul Nakasone, the commander of
U.S. Cyber Command, has insisted his forces "must take this fight to the
enemy, just as we do in other aspects of conflict." His then-deputy has
also argued that the United States "cannot cede any territory" to
adversaries as the "Russians will keep pushing until we push back on
them."

Worse, Dmitri Alperovitch recently warned [that if Russia launches cyber
attacks after "\[h\]aving already exhausted the power of economic
sanctions, America and its European [allies would have few choices other
than to respond to these attacks with offensive
cyber-strike]{.mark}s]{.underline} of their own." [[Such dynamics can
feed]{.mark} a [spiraling e]{.mark}scalation in cyberspace [that might
take on a life outside of the control of
policymakers]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, [[Western offensive cyber operations might spark
war]{.underline}]{.mark}. U.S. cyber espionage and operations against
Putin, his cronies, or Russia's military forces will appear far more
ominous to Putin if he believes they are aimed at regime change. Could
Putin turn the other cheek if the United States were to electronically
raid the cryptocurrency wallets of Russia's sanctions-avoiding
kleptocrats? He might feel the need to escalate his own cyber operations
as part of his own version of defending forward.

[[Escalation could happen on the battlefield as
well]{.underline}.]{.mark} According to the New York Times, teams from
U.S. Cyber Command are "in place to interfere with Russia's digital
attacks and communications." Other teams are almost certainly collecting
digital intelligence on the location and intent of Russian combat
forces. The United States is sharing such intelligence with the
Ukrainians but apparently not yet providing any real-time targeting.
That may change soon, as the United States seeks to alleviate
intensifying attacks on civilians. And with his KGB-bred paranoia, Putin
might already see the presence of U.S. defensive and intelligence teams
operating on or against Russian military networks as evidence of direct
U.S. involvement in the war. Confirming his apparent belief that Ukraine
is just a NATO puppet, this might force a response, either inside or
outside of cyberspace.

Further, if Western governments have infiltrated Russia's operational
military networks, they may feel pressure to disrupt those networks to
prevent civilian massacres. Because cyber capabilities are billed as
non-lethal, reversible, and non-escalatory, tub-thumping newspapers may
push decision-makers to take shots they might not otherwise: "We can't
create a no-fly zone but can use cyber capabilities to prevent civilian
harm." Some well-meaning national leaders may succumb to this pressure,
potentially causing a larger conflict.

Future Risks

[[Even if Russia and the West avoid direct conflict this time, they
might not be so lucky the next]{.mark}. As relations worsen, future
disruption of critical Western infrastructur]{.underline}e by Russian
intelligence, such as the NotPetya and Olympic Destroyer attacks, [are
less likely to be viewed as mere crimes. [Repeated crises bordering on
war may further erode]{.mark} the tacit agreements and relative
[restraint]{.mark} of quieter times. [After repeated iterations]{.mark}
of intensifying cyber operations, [both]{.mark} Russia and the West may
[feel their backs to the wall with few options left other than military
force]{.mark} when the next crisis]{.underline} --- physical or cyber
--- [emerges]{.underline}. Under extreme conditions, some of the same
characteristics that lead cyber capabilities to be a pressure release
might have the opposite effect, a mechanism that Bob Jervis and I have
described as the Escalation Inversion.

If Putin believes a direct conflict with NATO is likely and expects its
adversaries to take measures to reduce vulnerabilities, he could
conclude that the best possibility for success is to launch a massive
preemptive cyber attack. Since the U.S. military may seem otherwise
unbeatable, this may lead Russia to "compensate with audacity in order
to redress the balance." [The more the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [brags about its
overwhelming offensive cyber advantage, but frets over weak defenses,
the more any adversary might feel the need to target the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as early and as hard
as possible]{.underline}.

If Russia fears war with the United States may happen on Saturday, it
might feel the need to get in its cyber punches on Friday. If the United
States thinks the same, it may need to start on Thursday. Cyber
capabilities may be to World War III as mobilization timelines were to
World War I.

[Since a cyber sucker punch may also seem less escalatory, [adversaries
could be tempted to take risks]{.mark} they would not
otherwise]{.underline}. In this situation, [the sense that cyber is a
pressure-release valve becomes positively dangerous: If the system is
seen to be stable, then there is less reason to act with restraint,
thereby making it less stable]{.underline}. Fortunately, the good news
is leading U.S. policymakers appear attuned to this risk.

Avoiding Escalation

[[How can Washington reduce the risk of cyber attacks escalating into a
direct conflict with Russia? First, by recognizing
it]{.underline}]{.mark}. Cyber conflict may be an intelligence contest
or a pressure release in peacetime and something quite different during
or after a major war in Europe. Cyber war may be far easier to stumble
into when states fear the wolf at their door.

Second, [[escalation control requires a better understanding of
political psychology]{.underline}]{.mark} --- specifically the mindset
and desperation of one inscrutable, increasingly isolated, and
blood-covered tyrant. There were more than enough expert commentators
who believed that Putin would never invade Ukraine because it
objectively seemed so irrational. Assessments of cyber escalation must
also cover seeming irrationality, including the misperceptions,
mistakes, and miscalculations that can lead even the most rational
leaders to get caught up in an escalatory spiral that is no longer under
their control.

Third, [preventing escalation requires military and intelligence leaders
to understand and respect cyber capabilities]{.underline}. Cyber
capabilities are not "magic invisible weapons" but rather real weapons
with massive, cascading consequences. They have a range of advantages
and restrictions that sober-minded national leaders should approach as
they would any other weapon.

Finally, [[even if we dodge a bullet this time, we should not become
complacent]{.underline}]{.mark}. Personally, I would put the chances of
cyber conflict escalating into a Russia--NATO war at less than 10
percent. With luck, escalation will not happen, and I will be written
off as a "cyber catastrophist." "Cyber doesn't work like that," we will
tell ourselves. "Remember the lessons of the Ukrainian cyber non-war.
Cyber doesn't escalate. It isn't useful on the battlefield or for
coercing other states."

This will hopefully continue to be true for weeks or even years. But
[the world is in the first few decades of an information age that will
continue]{.underline} for a long time. [[The **existential stakes** of
cyber conflict rise as more countries become more **digitized** and more
**reliant** on **vulnerable** information
technology]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### \[x\] Hybrid warfare escalates---strong incentives for both Russia and NATO states

"Envisioning a Russia-NATO Conflict: Implications for Deterrence
Stability," EURO-ATLANTIC SECURITY REPORT, 2---18, p. 5-8\]

"Hybrid" scenarios: trigger for conflict?

[[One can envisage a number of "hybrid" scenarios of Russia-NATO
conflict where operations]{.mark} which started]{.underline} in the
cyber, economic, criminal, or "active measure" domains, [below the
threshold of conflict, [trigger a military response]{.mark}]{.underline}
or are followed by the physical use of force. As noted in the discussion
on the definitions of a conflict, [the threshold]{.underline} between
crisis and military conflict [may not be explicitly]{.underline} stated
or otherwise [clear to all sides; and it may also be ignored during a
crisis]{.underline}. This aspect is especially relevant in the current
period of increased interference in the internal affairs of NATO
countries attributed to Russia and of the high volume of information
'warfare' between Russia and NATO countries.

[Russia remains vigilant about foreign interference]{.underline} in its
internal affairs and the threat of subversion leading to a severe
destabilization of the regime. In the past, Moscow has made accusations
about foreign sponsorship of Chechen and radical Islamic terrorists
targeting Russia, and has alleged the existence of training camps on the
territories of NATO states for activists planning colour revolutions in
Ukraine and Belarus. In the extreme circumstances of a crisis, [if the
Russian leadership became convinced that a non-military campaign against
it]{.underline} (which might also involve cyber activities and what
Russia calls attempts to instigate colour revolutions) [had intensified,
this could lead to a military response]{.underline}.

[With regards to NATO, some of its members' views mirror the Russian
assessment that we are already in a state of conflict,]{.underline} in
which the boundary between peace and war is blurred, and that their
defences are being actively attacked through nonmilitary means. They are
thus concerned about a scenario in which Russia initiates an attack that
moves swiftly from non-military to military means. This scenario should
be not dismissed. At the same time, one needs to be wary of interpreting
all disturbing developments as part of a grand Russian plan culminating
in a provocation or use of force. So there should be prudence before any
country presses the "panic button" at the national or NATO / European
Union level. There should also be close analysis of early warning
indicators related to the gravity, intensity and diversity of incidents
and to connections between them. The overall political context and state
of the RussiaNATO relationship would also be important: what would be
the political and strategic reasons for Russia to move from
sub-threshold to abovethreshold activities?

[Individual NATO countries would have a decisive role in how some of the
"hybrid" scenarios would play out]{.underline}. An Ally can choose to
play down or up the importance of certain developments and incidents; it
can seek NATO and/or EU support, decide to respond individually
(including through actions that are escalatory), or use a mix of both
approaches. The Ally's overall reputation and patterns of international
behaviour can matter for determining whether its "frontline"
intelligence and assessments are to be trusted. But given the danger of
alliance entrapment, NATO also needs to have multiple channels for
corroborating the evidence and assessing developments.

Escalation: Can a NATO -- Russia conflict be managed?

[[Once a conflict was under way, the "fog of war" and rising
unpredictability would inevitably set in,]{.mark} [complicating]{.mark}
the implementation of any predetermined theories of escalation,
[deescalation]{.mark} and]{.underline} inter-[conflict
management.]{.underline} The actual dynamics of a conflict and the
perceptions of the stakes involved are extremely difficult to predict.
Simulations and table-top exercises can give only limited insights into
the actual decisionmaking processes and interactions.

Still, Russian military theorists and practitioners seem to assume that
a conflict with NATO can be managed and controlled in a way that would
bring it to a swift end consistent with Russian aims. The Russian theory
of victory would seek to exploit weak points in an Alliance war effort.
Based on the conviction that democracies are weak and their leaders and
populations are risk-averse, Russia may assume that its threats of
horizontal or vertical escalation could be particularly effective. It
would also try to bring home the notion that it has much higher stakes
in the conflict (regime survival) than a majority of the NATO members
involved, and thus will be ready to push the boundaries of the conflict
further. It would most likely try to test and exploit potential
divisions within the Alliance, combining selective diplomacy and
activation of its intelligence assets in some NATO states with a degree
of selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

[[Any NATO-Russia conflict would]{.mark} inevitably [have a nuclear
dimension.]{.mark} The role of nuclear weapons as a tool for escalation
control for Russia has been thoroughly debated by experts]{.underline},
but when and how Russia might use (and not merely showcase or activate)
nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an open question. Beyond catch
phrases such as "escalate to de-escalate" or "escalate to win" there are
a wider range of options for Russian nuclear weapon use. For example, a
single nuclear warning shot could be lethal or non-lethal. It could be
directed against a purely military target or a military-civilian one.
Detonation could be configured for an EMP effect. A "false flag" attack
is also conceivable. These options might be used to signal escalation
and could significantly complicate NATO's responses.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the conflict to
achieve these goals, and what mechanisms and means it would use while
trying to maintain some degree of control over the conflict.

The goals and methods of waging a conflict with Russia would probably
have to be limited in order to avoid a massive nuclear exchange. Such
limitations would also involve restrictions on striking back against
targets on Russian territory. But [too narrow an approach could put too
much restraint on NATO's operations:]{.underline} the Russian regime's
stability may ultimately need to be threatened in order to force the
leadership into terminating the conflict. NATO would thus need to
establish what a proportional self-defence response to Russian actions
would involve, and to what extent cyber operations or attacks against
military targets in quite different parts of Russia would be useful as
tools of escalation to signal NATO's resolve. Moreover, individual NATO
Allies, especially those directly affected by Russia's actions, might
pursue their individual strategies of escalation.

[With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance]{.underline}, with the US
taking the lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on]{.mark} concepts of [escalation control]{.mark} and on
lessons from the Cold War confrontation [might be
misleading]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The circumstances in which a
Russia -NATO conflict would play out would be radically different from
the 20th century screenplay. Moreover, instead of gradual (linear)
escalation or salami tactics escalation, it is possible to imagine
surprizing "leap frog" escalation, possibly connected with actions in
different domains (e.g. a cyberattack against critical infrastructure).
Flexibility, good intelligence and inventiveness in responding to such
developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

Russian and NATO [a[ssumptions regarding conflict termination would most
likely not survive the first hours of an actual conflict. Both sides are
capable of underestimating the resolve of the other side to prevail in a
conflict and the other side's willingness to commit the necessary
resources and endure the costs,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[especially once
both sides start committing their political capital and
resources]{.mark} and the casualties accumulate]{.underline}.

With regards to Russia, Moscow would most likely be approaching the
conflict with a clearer concept of its war aims and thus develop
better-formed views on conflict termination. It would seek to establish
escalation dominance and confront NATO with a binary choice of either
accepting defeat or further intensification of fighting. Such
intensification might involve a move to the nuclear level, but Russia
would also have conventional escalation options, such as conventional
deep strikes.

At the same time, it should be highlighted that Russia is unlikely to
start a conflict which involves a high degree of uncertainty about its
final outcome and carries a risk of military defeat. Russia cannot
safely assume that US-led NATO would act with restraint, nor could it be
sure that the Alliance would be ready to surrender and terminate a
conflict early. For internal reasons Russia cannot afford to lose a "big
war", so the [[most prudent option would generally be not to initiate
such a conflict]{.mark} in the first place. Such logic could, however,
get lost in some of the hybrid scenarios and scenarios of an inadvertent
outbreak of a conflict]{.underline}.

[On the NATO side, conflict termination has not been the focus of close
attention]{.underline}, as the Alliance has concentrated in recent years
on strengthening deterrence and probing the issue of defence. As one of
the workshop participants put it, "NATO is in the deterring Russia
business not in the winning a war with Russia business". This is not a
new problem. War termination proved to be a difficult subject for the
Alliance in the Cold War, as it involved delicate questions about
maintaining NATO's political cohesion and dealing with the consequences
of major nuclear exchanges. Nevertheless, NATO's ability to persevere in
a conflict should not be underestimated. Opinions that NATO would
collapse following a Russian first strike seem to be based more on
stereotypes about the weakness of Western democracies than on any
insight into how Alliances actually operate during wartime, especially
when fighting a defensive war that is perceived as just. Still, it may
be assumed that NATO would have major difficulty in setting and
implementing any conflict termination strategy based on the
intensification of military pressure on Russia, especially beyond the
immediate theatre of operations. Individual Allies, first and foremost
the US, might have to take a lead in that.

### Russia Impact: A2 "Russia Peaceful / Not Revisionist"

133-153, Taylor&Francis\]

[[The 'defensive Russia']{.underline} [perspective is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely [[convincing]{.underline}]{.mark}
either, for at least three reasons. [First, the claim]{.underline} that
[Russia is a staunch defender of]{.underline} [principles]{.underline}
like state sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs [is
problematic.]{.underline} [Granted, [Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}
consistently [[emphasizes]{.mark}]{.underline} these [[norms]{.mark} in
official]{.underline} policy [documents]{.underline} and promotes them
in diplomatic forums. [[In practice]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[Russia has violated]{.mark} such [principles
repeatedly]{.mark}]{.underline} within the post-Soviet space. Examples
are Russia's takeover of [[Crimea]{.mark},]{.underline} its meddling in
south-eastern [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, and its longstanding
support for separatist regions in [[Georgia]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Abkhazia and South Ossetia) [[and Moldova]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Transnistria). As Lo (2015, pp. 71--72) rightly remarks, '[[there is a
stark disconnect between]{.mark} its]{.underline} \[Russia's\]
[[formal]{.underline}]{.mark} [[allegiance]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the "primacy of [[international
law]{.underline}]{.mark}" and the territorial integrity of
nation-states, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [a]{.underline} highly
[selective]{.underline} [approach toward
[implementing]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}such
[[principles]{.underline}]{.mark}.' Likewise, Bolt and Cross (2018, p.
30) note that, 'while Russia professes to champion sovereignty and
non-intervention as standards for the world order, these guidelines
somehow do not apply to Moscow's own behaviour in its immediate
neighbourhood.' In other words, there is a gap between Moscow's rhetoric
and actions, which does not square with the 'defensive Russia'
perspective. [[Second, it appears questionable
whether]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia's [[assertive foreign policy
is]{.mark} a natural]{.underline} and almost automatic [[response
to]{.underline}]{.mark} aggressive [[encroachments]{.mark},]{.underline}
both normative and geopolitical, from Western powers. For example[, [it
is]{.mark} highly [debatable]{.mark} whether Russia's takeover of
[Crimea was]{.mark} a pre-emptive move,]{.underline} as some claim, [[to
block NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} from establishing a naval base there
(for contrasting views, see Milne, 2014, March 5; Motyl, 2015).
Likewise, [[there was little risk]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[NATO would
offer]{.underline}]{.mark} post-Yanukovych [[Ukraine a
M]{.underline}]{.mark}embership [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}ction
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}lan. According to then-Russian President
Medvedev's own account, [[the]{.mark} [alliance]{.mark} seemed to have
[understood the dangers of]{.mark} eastward [enlargement]{.mark} and
given up on it after the 2008 war]{.underline} in Georgia (Reuters,
2011). The financial crisis of that same year and the ensuing Greek debt
crisis further contributed to enlargement fatigue among many EU member
states. Consequently, [there was little prospect]{.underline} [for
Ukraine]{.underline} (or any other post-Soviet state, for that matter)
to join either of these two organizations in the short to medium term.
Moreover, European militaries had downsized since the end of the Cold
War, while the US was engaged in its so-called pivot to Asia. If
anything, the direct threat posed by NATO to Russia was therefore
dwindling. Against this background, it is difficult to interpret
Moscow's takeover of Crimea and activities in eastern Ukraine as a
purely defensive response to external pressures. [Thirdly, it is unclear
why the West]{.underline} -- and [not Russia -- should adjust its status
ambitions]{.underline} and policies. As Freire (2011) demonstrates,
[[Russia is a status overachiever relative to the power
resources]{.underline}]{.mark} (economic, demographic, and military)
that it controls. This means that [[Russia punches above its weight and
occupies an extremely prominent position in world
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} -- at least in comparison to other
countries with a roughly equal amount of material capabilities such as
Japan, Brazil, or India. None of these countries is a permanent member
of the UN Security Council, for example. This raises the question of
[how many great-power privileges must Russia be granted before its
outsized status ambitions are satisfied.]{.underline} More generally,
[[it is questionable whether the creation of a modern-day concert of
great powers]{.underline}]{.mark}, similar to the Concert of Europe in
the second half of the nineteenth century, [[is possible or even
desirable]{.mark}. As Rynning]{.underline} (2015, p. 552)
[observes,]{.underline} not only is concerted power in Europe unlikely,
but its [pursuit could be dangerous]{.underline} in so far as [it could
herald the type of unrestrained]{.underline} or flexible [[balance of
power politics that presaged the great wars of the twentieth
century.]{.mark} Kagan]{.underline} (2017) likewise
[asserts]{.underline} that, a [return to spheres of influence would not
calm international waters. It would merely return the world to the
condition it was in at the end of the nineteenth century, with competing
great powers clashing over inevitably intersecting and overlapping
spheres.]{.underline} In essence, both the policy prescriptions derived
from the 'defensive Russia' perspective and its explanations of Moscow's
international conduct require some elaboration.

#### Russia's behavior proves it is revisionist

[Russian [propaganda]{.mark}]{.underline}, going back to czarist and
Soviet times, often [[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Western powers
are encircling Russia, forcing Moscow to be]{.underline}
[belligerent]{.underline}]{.mark} against its wishes. Russia is the
perennial victim of aggressive foreign powers trying to keep Moscow
locked in the steppes and, in the worst case, to install themselves in
the Kremlin. Undoubtedly, Russia has been invaded repeatedly in the
past: Mongol hordes, Napoleon, and Hitler all tried to extend their
power over it. But now [[claims]{.underline}]{.mark} [of]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} potential [repetition of such invasions]{.underline} by
Russia's Western neighbors [[ring hollow. Neither Europe nor]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[has]{.underline} [any interest]{.underline}]{.mark} [in controlling
Russian lands]{.underline}. On the contrary, it is [Russia]{.underline}
that [has managed to extend its reach]{.underline} [along a front from
the Baltic to the Mediterranean]{.underline} and is projecting power to
the Arctic and the Atlantic. [[Europe is]{.underline}]{.mark} being
[[encircled by Russia --- not the other way around]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Russia asserts]{.underline} that [it is under siege by the
West]{.underline}. Western antagonism, the argument goes, is evident in
NATO's addition of new members, including the latest one, Montenegro,
which joined in 2017; in the U.S. and EU support for various "color
revolutions" that erupted across a belt of countries from Ukraine to
North Africa and the Middle East; and in the U.S.-led wars in the Middle
East. In a 2019 speech, General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the
Russian general staff, accused the United States of conducting a "policy
of expanding the system of military presence directly at Russia's
borders." Such a Western policy of encirclement supposedly forces Moscow
to lash out to defeat the "Trojan horse" of "color revolutions" and the
various military offensives allegedly targeting Russia.

[The [claim]{.mark} of encirclement serves well to [justify
Putin's]{.mark}]{.underline} neo-imperial [[policies]{.mark}. Russia's
wars in Georgia]{.underline} (in 2008) [and in Ukraine]{.underline}
(ongoing since 2014), [its support for]{.underline} Bashar
al-[Assad]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [Syria]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} [various forms of political warfare it carries out in
Europe]{.underline} and the United States are considered responses to a
consistent Western offensive. In brief, Western powers, led by the U.S.,
are reawakening a sense of deep insecurity in Russia, perennially
fearful of another Mongol invasion from the east or of a new Napoleon or
Hitler penetrating deep into Muscovite lands from the west. These claims
are repeated by those in the West who are opposed to NATO enlargement,
to an American engagement in Central Europe or involvement in the wider
Middle East, or to any policy that seeks to impose costs on Russian
misbehavior. From this point of view, [Russia is]{.underline}
[aggressive because we made]{.underline} ~~her~~ [\[them\]
so.]{.underline}

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} geopolitical [[map]{.underline}]{.mark},
however, [[tells a different story. Not only is]{.mark}
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[argument]{.underline}]{.mark} that Russia is
being encircled [deeply flawed and]{.underline} factually
[[incorrect]{.underline}]{.mark} (starting from the misconception of
NATO as an offensive alliance), but [[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[completely misses]{.mark} the main [developments]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the past few years.

Along Europe's eastern frontier, from the Baltic to the Black Sea,
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} has a sizeable military presence and has
[[demonstrated]{.underline}]{.mark} [its]{.underline} [[willingness
to]{.underline} [invade]{.underline}]{.mark} and control territories
(e.g., South Ossetia in [[Georgia;]{.mark} Crimea]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} eastern [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}). It
has [[entrenched]{.underline}]{.mark} [itself [in
Syria]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to buttress Assad, returning to a
position of influence in the Middle East that it has not held since the
late 1970s. [It has developed a [partner]{.mark}ship]{.underline} of
sorts [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} Erdogan's
[[Turkey]{.underline}]{.mark}, convincing it to buy S-400 air-defense
systems and thereby making that country an ever less reliable U.S. ally.
It has [[built]{.underline}]{.mark} or upgraded seven military [[bases
in]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} region, gaining
control of one of the key shipping arteries between Europe and Asia,
estimated to be 40 percent faster than shipping through the Suez Canal.
In a surprising show of force in late 2019, [Russia]{.underline}
[[surged]{.underline}]{.mark} ten
[[sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}]{.underline} [[into
the]{.underline}]{.mark} North [[Atlantic]{.underline}]{.mark},
demonstrating a capability that had been dormant since the late Cold
War. [[And]{.underline}]{.mark} in recent months it has
[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[engagement]{.mark}
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} the messy war in [[Libya]{.underline}]{.mark},
becoming a key player in direct competition with Turkey in the political
dynamics of this Mediterranean area.

The effect of these Russian actions is that [Europe is now facing
a]{.underline} [consistent pressure along a crescent]{.underline} that
goes from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, combined with a latent
military threat from the North Atlantic and the Arctic. In itself, the
existence of an unstable outer zone on the margins of the European Union
and NATO is not new. The wars in the Middle East and North Africa and
the fragility of the states located between NATO (and the EU) and Russia
have multiple long-term causes, and those domestic and regional dynamics
are distinct from one another and unfolding with their own tempos and
rationales. The war in Libya, for example, has its own causes and
developments, which are different from those of, for example, Russia's
invasion of Ukraine or the conflict in Syria.

Over the past few years, however, Russia's interventions in these
regions have imparted a geopolitical cohesion to what previously had
been separate zones of instability. Russia is now a central player along
the length of this volatile frontier. European security is increasingly
at the mercy of Russia, and not just along the tense but geographically
limited Central European frontier that historically separated the core
of Europe from Moscow's westward imperial aspirations.

This is an enormous success for Moscow, for which the
[Obama]{.underline} administration, [eager to ["reset"]{.mark}
relations]{.underline} with Russia [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[[charm]{.underline}]{.mark} this revanchist power into a progressive
community of "responsible nations," [[bears]{.underline}]{.mark} much
[[blame]{.underline}]{.mark}. In Ukraine, the Obama administration
refused to counter the Russian invasion and did not provide lethal
defensive weapons to the Ukrainian army. In Syria, [Obama
never]{.underline} [enforced the "red line]{.underline}"
[crossed]{.underline} [multiple times]{.underline} by Assad, who used
chemical weapons against his own population as Washington demonstrated
unwillingness to oppose him and his Iranian and Russian supporters. In
Libya, the U.S. infamously "led from behind," a euphemistic catchphrase
for the abdication of American leadership. And, more broadly,
encouraging the Arab Spring without the determination to manage its
outcomes created an image of the U.S. as a reckless agent of upheaval.
Russia then could offer its services to the embattled authoritarian
regimes, for instance in Syria, to restore order and maintain
continuity. The unexpected but now real outcome is the geopolitical
encirclement of Europe by Russia.

Russia can now exercise some influence over the flow of migrants from
Syria and North Africa (through Libya), exacerbating at will a problem
that has bedeviled European political leaders over the past several
years. By abetting further violence by the Assad regime, for instance,
Russia contributes to pushing thousands of people out of Syria, giving
it the power to blackmail Europe in a tactic similarly adopted by
Turkey. The approach is brutally simple: Threaten to flood Europe with
migrants (through Greece for those coming from Syria, through Italy for
those coming from Libya) to obtain some benefit such as money (as Turkey
does) or economic and political alignment (as Russia seems to want) in
exchange for keeping European borders sealed. Given the demographic
pressures from sub-Saharan Africa, the state that has the ability to
control the population flow into Europe wields long-term influence over
the security and the domestic politics of much of the European
continent. Russia has positioned itself to be that power while
simultaneously keeping military pressure on Europe's eastern frontier.
In Ukraine, Russia continues to wage war and occupy Crimea. And Russian
military exercises regularly train for offensive actions against
Moscow's European neighbors.

To deal with such a geopolitical encirclement, European states are
adopting increasingly separate policies. Never short of big ideas,
President Macron of France is leading the charge to open the doors to
Putin and "normalize relations." More business-like, Germany is trying
to have it both ways, keeping energy deals with Moscow alive while not
wanting to follow the openly pro-Russian approach of the French. Italy,
the country most immediately affected by Russia's foray into Libya, from
which most of its migrants arrive, is deeply unhappy with the other two
European powers, and with France in particular because Paris together
with Moscow supports the opposing side in the Libyan war while Italy and
Turkey are behind the U.N.-approved government. In the end, however,
Italy, more interested in stopping the flow of migrants than in
competing for natural resources in Libya, is likely to support a soft
approach toward Russia. The Central European EU and NATO members are at
best perplexed and at worst deeply worried by their Western allies'
friendly overtures toward Russia. And this is just one aspect, centered
on Russia, of the various intra-European rifts.

There are no European solutions to these growing divisions. The European
Union is a complex but fragile and inefficient political construction
that, in a geopolitical competition with a risk-taking imperial Russia
seeking to expand its influence over the European continent, is
incapable of achieving strategic coherence among its members. It has no
meaningful answer to Russia's presence in Libya, in Syria, or in the
eastern Mediterranean, to Russian occupation of Crimea and eastern
Ukraine, or to Moscow's diplomacy attracting European leaders with
promises of peace and stability and economic engagement. There are of
course renewed attempts to energize an EU security policy with various
initiatives (such as the Permanent Structured Cooperation on defense,
the European Defense Fund, and the Coordinated Annual Review on Defense)
aimed at increasing intra-EU military cooperation and development. But
these efforts often give the impression that the EU is seeking
"strategic autonomy" from the United States rather than addressing the
security threats around its frontiers.

Moreover, no matter how many new coordinating efforts are launched by
the EU or even NATO, the hard truth is that [[only a few]{.mark}
European [states]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are willing to take security
seriously]{.underline}]{.mark}, devoting the necessary resources and
mustering the national will to compete with Russia. The military
capabilities of most European states remain atrophied. The
[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} that stronger
[[Europe]{.mark}an]{.underline} states [would [be a threat to Russia,
exacerbating]{.mark}]{.underline} an already tense
[[relations]{.mark}hip]{.underline}, [[is
misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}. A militarily powerful Estonia or
[[Poland will not invade Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, and a sizeable
[[Europe]{.mark}an]{.underline} military contingent in the wider
Mediterranean basin [[has no means of threatening
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark}. More broadly, the purpose of larger
European military capabilities would not be to counter Russian forces
directly in every location in which they are present, but rather to be
able to stabilize North Africa and parts of the Middle East while
enhancing [[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} on Europe's eastern
frontier. By doing so, Europe could [[remove]{.underline}]{.mark} some
of the [[opportunities]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[Russia
used]{.underline} [to insert itself]{.underline}]{.mark} into a belt of
weak and divided states.

### Russia Solvency: Resilience---General

#### \[x\] Resilience strategies are vital to addressing emerging hybrid threats---we need to prioritize them

Russian and Chinese Hybrid Threats," Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security, Atlantic Council, 7---20, p. 3\]

Indeed, traditional security concerns, such as nuclear weapons and
conventional defense and deterrence, will not go away for the
transatlantic community. Yet, [going forward, [transatlantic]{.mark}
nations and [institutions will increasingly need to focus on
hybrid]{.mark}]{.underline} and nontraditional [[threats]{.underline}
t]{.mark}oo.2 [[This is particularly underscored by]{.underline} the
2020 [coronavirus]{.underline} crisis, [in which both Russia and China
have played]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[roles]{.underline}.
[Both]{.underline}]{.mark} China and Russia [[capitalized on the crisis
to wage disinformation campaigns]{.underline}]{.mark} against the West.
[They promulgated conspiracy theories]{.underline} designed to sow fear
about America's handling of the outbreak and t[o promote the successes
of their own authoritarian regimes. Moscow and Beijing also
strategically delivered aid and medical supplie]{.underline}s to
European countries in attempts [to build good will and
clout]{.underline} on the international stage. [[These issues cannot be
effectively addressed alone]{.mark} or in a vacuum, [making global
cooperation and collective action--especially among transatlantic
allies---**paramount**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even as transatlantic
nations and institutions shift priorities]{.underline} in the wake of
the coronavirus crisis, [[key counter-hybrid priorities, such as
building resilience,]{.mark}]{.underline} strengthening civil response
capacities, and investing in civic education, [simultaneously [serve
priorities]{.mark} for pandemic prevention and response. [This is all
the more reason to **prioritize** the counter-hybrid
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Capacity building and interoperability initiatives are vital to solve

**Aronsson and Swaney, research Fellows, INSS, '21**

accessed 4-6-22\]

First, [[NATO should ensure that capacity-building and additional
resilience support remain priorities]{.mark}. China is using its
economic leverage to expand its security cooperation, and Beijing, along
with Russia, is undermining Alliance credibility. Some [partners have
become testing grounds for hybrid attacks. Capacity-building helps
counter that by strengthening partner institutions and resilience, and a
sense of shared security]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Partnership
Interoperability Initiative protects hard-earned interoperability with
some partners, and the Defence and Related Security Capacity Building
(DCB) Initiative already supports Georgia, Iraq, Jordan, Moldova, and
Tunisia. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly has recommended more attention
to Ukraine, the Western Balkans, and areas with weak institutions or
where democracy is undermined. Civil emergency planning through NATO's
Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre is also valuable.

[[Capacity-building programs are also a path to NATO interoperability
for partners, which remains a major driver for cooperation]{.mark} with
NATO---[even among neutral countries that may never contribute to a NATO
military operation.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is because NATO provides
internationally recognizable military standards and the ability to
plug-and-play into European Union (EU), United Nations, or other
multilateral operations. NATO interoperability certification is in
demand among partners, as are its robust programs for education,
training, and exercises. These activities promote defense and security
sector reform, strengthening institutions and transparency. NATO should
work to overcome constraints on partner participation in exercises,
especially for Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand.
Cooperative security depends on NATO's centrality as an international
standard-setter, a position that cannot be taken for granted.

\*\*edited for language

[Since [hybrid threats]{.mark} are designed to interrupt
effectiveness]{.underline} of the SEES model at some point, by trying to
create cognitive errors such as those arising from group thinking, 2
mirror imaging or applying unconscious confirmation bias, [they [can
challenge organizations like]{.mark}]{.underline} the European Union
(EU) and [[NATO]{.mark} even more than a state. The multilateral setting
-- [with several, connected national interests -- can be more vulnerable
to hybrid threat activities]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The things
that can go wrong in the SEES model are especially vulnerable in a
multilateral setting, unless there is a comprehensive approach,
willingness to exchange information, joint understanding on resilience,
and mechanisms to counter and respond in place.

[The way Moscow and Beijing think about interference and influence is
different from countries with a democratic system]{.underline}. For the
EU and NATO, both Russia and China are difficult states to deal with.
China is seen in the EU as a global partner, competitor and systemic
rival. It has not been on NATO's radar before the 2019 London Summit,
but the Report "NATO 2030" delivered by the Group of Expert appointed by
the Alliance's Secretary General states that "NATO must devote much more
time, political resources and action to the security challenges posed by
China" (2020: 12). Russia has been viewed by the West as a systemic
rival for much longer, but it has also been considered part of the
European cultural heritage in the EU. For NATO, Russia has been the
greatest military power in the East, which has conflicts of interest
with NATO. For the moment, open military conflict is not viewed as very
likely neither for Moscow nor for Beijing, although it is not excluded.
[This leaves the door open to hybrid threats, a mechanism that has roots
in authoritarian strategic culture but also has national
specificities]{.underline}. [The things that can go wrong]{.underline}
in the SEES model [are challenged by the new information environment
being manipulated according to the tactics of hybrid
threats.]{.underline} Even if the EU is not a military alliance, while
NATO is, both organizations are challenged in similar ways by hybrid
threats. [Given several factors, including overlapping membership, it is
clear that weakening one will also weaken the other]{.underline}.
Therefore, in the landscape of hybrid threats, the EU and NATO are
considered as a united target by hostile actors -- and they can also
best counter and respond to these threats if working together.

Against this backdrop, here follow some recommendations aimed to
policy-makers and expert communities

in both NATO and EU countries:

 The [importance of analysis is growing. Too much effort has been put
into collecting data, and not enough into training analysts. Older
[analysts need to be trained]{.mark}]{.underline} about the new
information environment and its functioning. In turn, the younger
generation needs to be trained on history, context and connections.
Central elements in training are understanding the psychology of the
adversary, the assessments of motivations, and rationales.

 The cultural context of information is lost in the volume of
information. [[International cooperation, especially on the part of an
alliance like NATO, needs to be lifted to a new level.
This]{.underline}]{.mark} does not only concern joint situational
awareness about hostile actors, but [also [involves understanding
partners and their perspectives. Without that mutual
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} among allies and partners,
[[divergences can become over politicized and
decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~paralyzed~~[, \[[frozen\] which
is what the actors behind hybrid threats
want]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

 [[There is a need for more effective training in the use of
open-source intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}, focusing on the sources
and tools for finding information, including the biases they may have.
In addition, more knowledge is needed to be able to detect linkages
between actions. Hybrid threat activities start in a settled way, often
on a very legal basis, and the potential for such activities to turn
into hostile acts needs to be recognized.

 Military communities should reach out more often to non-military
expert communities. To counter hybrid threats, a multidisciplinary
approach needs to be taken, which really means combining different
disciplinary fields and expertise coming from practitioners, academics
and the private sector.

 [[Sharing the vocabulary is important when building situational
awareness]{.underline}]{.mark}. Civil-military cooperation is needed
here. The civilian side uses different words than the military and
sometimes, even if the understanding of a concept would be shared,
actors do not understand due to the use of different terms, and
discussions can turn into an unnecessary battle of words.

[NATO's success as a collective defense organization lies in its ability
to rally]{.underline} twenty-nine [member states in defense]{.underline}
of any one of them. [[**Cohesion** is what makes the alliance
**strong**]{.underline}]{.mark} and unique, [but it is difficult to
sustain]{.underline} day after day, under constant pressure from
adversaries.

One useful way to measure cohesion is in financial terms. Despite a
pledge to contribute the equivalent of at least 2 percent of their gross
domestic product to defense by 2024, some member states seem likely to
miss the target. While this does not prove that the allies disagree on
the nature and gravity of the threats before them, it does strongly
suggest that some have not fully bought into the agreed priorities.

[[Many factors are undermining cohesion in NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
an era with no single unifying threat, different [members inevitably
have different interests]{.underline} in diverse centers of power and
influence. Allies also diverge on what constitute democratic standards
and appropriate responses to competition with non-Western actors.1

[It is up to individual countries]{.underline} to safeguard their
freedom to respond to a call for help from an ally, address
vulnerabilities and gaps in their national systems, and take proactive
measures to reduce risks. [But [the alliance as an organization can
help]{.mark}. [This is especially true when it comes to understanding
and responding to new threats to cohesion. None is more relevant than
the hybrid]{.mark}]{.underline} war for hearts and minds that NATO's
adversaries are waging through political interference and
disinformation.

ISSUES AT STAKE

While not a new phenomenon, hybrid warfare has been widely mentioned in
international discourse since at least 2014. The Russian military
intervention in Ukraine and annexation of Crimea showed that NATO and
its member states lacked ready-made responses to the emergence of a
threat aimed directly at solidarity and cohesion. The experience has
prompted allies to rethink, act, and adapt quickly, especially with
regard to instruments for protection beyond triggering Article 5 of
NATO's founding treaty, which declares that an attack on one ally is an
attack on all.

Hybrid warfare includes a variety of activities and covers the use of
different instruments to destabilize a society by influencing its
decisionmaking. [Frequent instruments include]{.underline}:

[Interference in electoral processes]{.underline}: An adversary can use
techniques from campaigning through the media and social networks to
securing financial resources for a political group to influence the
outcome of an election in a direction that favors the adversary's
political interests.

[Disinformation and false news]{.underline}: An adversary can create a
parallel reality and use falsehoods to fuel social fragmentation. The
idea is to disorient the public and make it difficult for a government
to seek public approval for a given NATO policy or operation.

[Cyber attacks]{.underline}: An adversary can pressure NATO governments
into not coming to each other's aid in times of crisis by threatening
devastating cyber attacks aimed at the civilian population. Examples
include attacks on networks governing hospitals or electricity and water
supplies.2

[Drone attacks:]{.underline} These are similar to cyber attacks but on a
more limited scale. An adversary can use remotely piloted platforms to
inflict misery on civilians by crippling the operations of airports, air
ambulances, and police helicopters. Such attacks can also hamper
military airspace operations in early phases of a conflict.3

[Financial influence]{.underline}: An adversary can make investments,
conclude unfavorable energy-supply deals, or offer loans that make a
country vulnerable in the long run to political pressure.

Russia is the most frequently cited source of hybrid attacks,
particularly disinformation, interference in elections, and cyber
attacks.4 It and other states often act via third, nonstate entities
such as nationalist, criminal, or terrorist groups. This leaves the
attacking state room for deniability, confuses the attacked country, and
can prevent a timely and adequate response. Most hybrid operations to
date have featured a mixture of mechanisms used by state and nonstate
actors, and a clear line between them is difficult to draw.

NATO's efforts to address hybrid threats have been conducted at two
levels: defining strategy at the supranational level and assisting the
target countries at the national level. The latter effort will receive a
boost when the new counterhybrid support teams on which members agreed
in July 2018 fully come into effect. NATO's Joint Intelligence and
Security Division is in charge of hybrid-related research and analysis,
while the Public Diplomacy Division tracks disinformation through online
instruments. The Emerging Security Challenges Working Group, established
in 2012, has a goal to identify and prioritize nontraditional threats.

Because hybrid attacks are a threat to the West as a whole, not just
NATO, and because they mostly rely on nonmilitary tools, the alliance
has been strengthening its cooperation with the European Union (EU). One
useful tool available to both organizations is the joint European Center
of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, established in Helsinki in
April 2017.

RECOMMENDATIONS

[[NATO can and should do more to counter hybrid
threats,]{.underline}]{.mark} following the proven strategy of prepare,
deter, and defend.5

BUILD RESILIENCE BY FOSTERING DEMOCRACY

[[The first]{.mark}, self-evident [recommendation is to deny adversaries
the opportunities they exploit for hybrid attacks. The more stable the
political systems]{.mark} and economies [of NATO countries are, the less
suitable ground they represent for hybrid
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A government that is credible,
popular, and trusted will have an easier time winning support for its
chosen course of action in NATO than other governments and will be
better able to resist disinformation and other forms of interference and
blackmail.6

Western Balkan countries seem particularly vulnerable, as their citizens
tend to have low trust in the authorities and do not believe that their
judiciaries are truly independent. In opinion polls, as many as 70
percent of respondents said that the law did not equally apply to all.7
Democracy and trust have declined in most Western Balkan countries over
the last ten years, a trend that overlaps with the crisis of democracy
throughout Europe.8

[[Steps that strengthen democracy and economies are the most effective
way of building resilience against hybrid attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Corruption deserves particular attention. Not all authoritarian and
illiberal governments are corrupt, but most abuse access to public and
European funds to give themselves a competitive advantage over political
rivals.9 [Once on a corrupt path, authoritarians are, in essence,
condemned to always seek to remain in power, lest they be prosecuted.
[It is a vicious circle, and this dynamic between authoritarianism and
corruption is not always understood]{.mark}]{.underline}---including by
the U.S. and EU leaderships, [[which does not serve the alliance
well.]{.underline}]{.mark}

SHARE BEST PRACTICES

[[NATO provides a platform from which allies can work when coping
with]{.mark} individual problems and [vulnerabilities. The alliance can
also help identif]{.mark}y particular [challenges]{.mark}]{.underline},
sometimes before the governments concerned do, and can play a role in
early warning. [[This matters because rapid decisionmaking is]{.mark}
sometimes the [key to success in hybrid
warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

THINK AND SPEAK COHERENTLY

[NATO is meeting the hybrid challenge with]{.underline} twenty-nine
[member states experiencing very different sociopolitical
realities]{.underline} and often using different concepts. [[A unified
vocabulary and strategy would limit]{.mark} the
[misunderstanding]{.mark} of threats, [improve collaboration, and
make]{.mark} the [sharing]{.mark} of [lessons learned more
effective]{.mark}---[so would an agreement on the prioritization of
tasks and responsibilities and a shared understanding of NATO's]{.mark}
role.]{.underline}

[[This would greatly help individual countries to build compatible and
comparable national strategies]{.mark}. Many of these
strategies]{.underline}, including that of the youngest member
Montenegro, [are in early stages of preparation, but divergences are
already becoming evident]{.underline}. Those that have been
completed---such as Slovenia's 2018 regulation on cyber and information
security or Croatia's 2017 National Security Strategy, which partly
deals with hybrid challenges---have largely opted for different
approaches.

[[NATO]{.mark} member states [must send a unified message inside and
out]{.mark}. As strategic communication is a mind-set, it has to be
built together carefully and fundamentally]{.underline}.12 [NATO's
communication strategy should be a result of joint efforts and hence a
common instrument against all threats, not just hybrid ones, at all
levels.]{.underline}

[[Due to interdependencies of communication and information systems, and
critical infrastructures, resilience can only be developed through an
integrated approach]{.underline}.[Disruptions]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} host nation and coalition partner networks and
critical [[infrastructure upon which NATO depends can degrade NATO's
ability to conduct operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Secondly,
[[projecting cyber defense beyond NATO'sterritory would help to define
global cybersecurity norms and behaviors around liberal democratic
values]{.mark}.]{.underline} In recognising this indivisibility of
security, the NATO-EU Joint Declaration,signed in Warsaw, stresses the
need to "foster the resilience of our partners" through individually
tailored projects. 13 Indeed, [[NATO should project its soft side of
cyber power in its neighborhood and globally with an aim to expand
secure, open and free cyberspace and advocating democratic liberal
values in cyberspace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

NATO has a wide range of cooperation formats with more than 40 partners.
These partnerships can be leveraged and further expanded according to
cyber defense needs of individual partners. 14 For example, in the
existing framework of the Partnership for Peace Planning and Review
Process, Georgia, Moldova, Iraq, Jordan have included cyber defense
aspects into their capacity-building packages. 15 Non-NATO nations also
participate in Smart Defense projects such as Multinational Cyber
Defense Capability Development (MNCD2), which focuses on sharing
technical information, situational awareness and creating a cyber
security assessmentteam. 16They have participated at NATO cyber defense
and crisis management exercises, and at technical exercises run by the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense of Excellence.It is possible to include
cyber defense issues in their consultations with NATO bodies (28+
meetings) and through staff-to-staff talks. Lastly, NATO educational
bodies provide training courses on strategic, operational and technical
levels to partners with requisite security clearances.

accessed 5-23-22\]

Second, [[NATO needs to identify which aspects of resilience it is
positioned to lead. The most pertinent issue seems to be reducing
Russian temptations to destabilize its eastern territory]{.mark},
notably Estonia and Latvia]{.underline} with significant
Russian-speaking minorities, and the Lithuanian-Polish border toward the
Kaliningrad exclave. [Russia-instigated gray zone conflict on NATO
territory seems more likely than a large-scale conventional
war,]{.underline} especially given the poor performance of Russian
forces in Ukraine. [[Russia still prefers to rely on disinformation and
subversion to stir ethnic and political discord a]{.mark}nd may also
return to using special operations incursions as a destabilization
strategy,]{.underline} as it did during its seizure of Crimea in 2014.
[[NATO needs to deter Russia]{.mark} a]{.underline}cross multiple
domains of warfare [[by structuring and training a part of its future
forces for gray zone eventualities]{.mark} that may precede Russia's
application of large-scale kinetic force. [Integrating preparations to
combat gray zone tactics]{.mark}]{.underline} into NATO's conventional
planning [[would allow it to implement a stronger, more crisis-ready
resilience concept]{.mark}. NATO's cyber defense capabilities are
obviously relevant against Russian attempts to disrupt allied or
national functions that may precede a conventional attack]{.underline}.
And NATO should also work to deny hostile powers the capacity to
neutralize or jam NATO and reconnaissance satellites.

#### Resilience key to checking Russian hybrid threat

analysts, '16**

SOCIETY IN AN INTERCONNECTED WORLD, 2016, p. 101-102\]

As noted by Jamie Shea,NATO's and EU'sroles in buttressing resilience of
most vulnerable and exposed countries often overlap, 8 particularly in
such areas as cyber security, strategic communication, civil
preparedness and countering Russia's hybrid warfare. [Although Russia's
hybrid warfare techniques have been extensively analysed,it is difficult
to anticipate when, where and what types of stressors will be created
and exploited by Moscow]{.underline}---or any other adversaries---in
order [to coerce target countries. Russia's approach typically combines
both applying a long-term pressure]{.underline} (e.g., hostile
propaganda and economic warfare) [and opportunistically administering
short-term sudden shocks]{.underline}, making it impossible to identify
only a single set of capacities needed to cope with its hybrid strategy.
[[A broad-based resilience of potential
targets]{.mark}---]{.underline}allies and partners alike--- [[which
addresses a wide range of vulnerabilities]{.mark} to both chronic and
acute stressors [is of **vital importance** if
NATO]{.mark},]{.underline} in cooperation with the EU, seeks [to deny
Moscow the achievement of its political and strategic objectives in
relation to the Alliance and its partners.]{.underline}

Equally important is a proper appreciation by the Alliance that Russia
will constantly aim to undermine NATO's legitimacy and credibility, so
that individual nations feel helpless and having no choice but to
acquiesce to Moscow's geopolitical demands. [[The efforts of the
Alliance]{.mark}---through its strategic communication, public diplomacy
and outreach---[to ensure high levels of trust in and support to its
core tasks]{.mark}, policies and strategies among the general public of
the allies and partners, as well as constant reassurance that "no one
will be left behind" in the face of adversity, [are fundamental
t]{.mark}o countering this. [It is as much about the upstream effort of
NATO to remain legitimate, relevant, visible, cohesive and credible as
about downstream buttressing of the most exposed or vulnerable
nation]{.mark}s]{.underline} (so-called "forward resilience").

[[China's strategic objectives in Europe are geared to maintaining
Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark} economic, political and military
[[power]{.underline}]{.mark} [and keeping the]{.underline}
**[C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist
**[P]{.underline}**arty [in power]{.underline} at home. [The [goal
is]{.mark}]{.underline} not just access to markets, but [[to
split]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**]{.mark}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [[members]{.mark} from one another to
prevent unified positions]{.underline} against China [[and]{.mark} to
break NATO and EU cohesion]{.underline}. It is important to note that
[[China's intention is to replace the]{.underline}]{.mark} post-Second
World War (1939-1945) [[Liberal rules-based order]{.underline}]{.mark}
and security architecture [[with its own]{.underline}]{.mark}
Beijing-centric order. China has been hostile to NATO since its embassy
was accidentally bombed by NATO forces during the Kosovo War
(1998-1999). The Chinese Communist Party's goal is to separate the
United States from NATO and NATO states from one another. There is one
major difference between the Russian and Chinese approach to subverting
NATO. China still wants access to the EU's economies, whereas Russia's
view is dominated by an environment of total great-power conflict.

[Chinese attempts to subvert Europe include divide-and-rule
tactics]{.underline} with Southern and Central European countries. China
has negotiated bilateral deals with several EU countries, including the
17+1 group of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia,
Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia and Slovenia. Eleven of
these countries are EU member states and four others are candidates.
Taking a page from Russia's attempt to undermine NATO's southern flank,
in 2017, China stated it was ready to discuss Turkey's membership in the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), whose members are China,
Russia, India, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan and
Uzebekistan.

As well, Greece and Italy have fallen into the big money-big debt trap
of China's Belt and Road Initiative. Chinese Shipping giant, COSCO, has
taken the controlling share of the Greek port of Piraeus and it is said
that China wants to build a high-speed rail link between Belgrade and
Budapest and then onward to the western part of the continent. The Port
of Piraeus is the main sea port of Athens, the largest port in Greece
and one of the largest in Europe. In the past decade, Chinese companies
have acquired controlling shares in 13 ports in Europe, including in
Greece, Spain and Belgium. Together, these facilities handle about 10
per cent of Europe's shipping-container capacity. In fact, China has
gained access to Europe's three largest ports: respectively Euromax in
Rotterdam, of which it owns 35 per cent; Antwerp in Belgium, of which it
holds a 20-per-cent stake; and Hamburg, Germany, where it is to build a
new terminal. China's People's Liberation Army (Navy) warships have
already paid a friendly port visit to Piraeus in Greece. Gary Roughead,
a former U.S. chief of naval operations, warned that "Chinese port
operators will be able to monitor U.S. ship movements closely, be aware
of maintenance activities, have access to equipment moving to and from
repair sites and interact freely with our crews over protracted
periods."

[[China is leveraging tensions]{.mark} in the Western
alliance]{.underline} over U.S. economic policies, including U.S.
sanctions on European countries and Washington's trade war with China,
climate change, multilateralism and the Iran nuclear deal. Beijing also
builds networks among European politicians, businesses, media,
think-tanks and universities to create layers of active support for
Chinese policies and interests as well as a means to shut down and
silence commentary from critics and dissidents. [[China has targeted
specific]{.mark} European countries'
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} to increase its economic presence,
including Greece's economic crisis and disenchantment among the
countries that represent the poor cousins of the EU, those discontented
with European Union conditions for investment, such as Serbia, and the
United Kingdom post-Brexit. All the while, [China is using its
investment and new presence to acquire foreign technology through legal
and illegal means, with the objective of dominating the innovation
industries of the future]{.underline}. The U.S. Department of Defense
has warned that [[China has sought to acquire]{.mark}, legally and
[illegally, Western technology]{.mark} in order [to modernize its
economy and build weapons]{.mark} to rival the strength of Western
militaries by striking further, harder and faster.
[Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} espionage and [[cyber espionage to gain
access to foreign military and industrial secrets is well
known]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Chinese government continues its
partnership with Russia in Europe, where the two countries have similar
strategic objectives and can work together to weaken and degrade U.S.
and NATO interests.

INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, Atlantic Council, 2019, p. 50-51\]

Develop New Rules for Disruptive Technologies

[The system must also be adapted to deal with]{.underline} new issues
that were not envisioned when the existing order was designed. Foremost
among these issues is emerging and disruptive technology, including
**[AI]{.underline}**, [additive manufacturing]{.underline} (or 3D
printing), [quantum computing, genetic engineering, robotics, directed
energy]{.underline}, the Internet of things (**[IOT]{.underline}**),
[5G, space, cyber, and many others.]{.underline}

Like other disruptive technologies before them, [these
innovations]{.underline} promise great benefits, but also [carry serious
downside risks]{.underline}. For example, AI is already resulting in
massive efficiencies and cost savings in the private sector. Routine
tasks and other more complicated jobs, such as radiology, are already
being automated. In the future, [autonomous weapons systems may go to
war against each other as human soldiers remain out of harm's
way.]{.underline}

Yet, [AI is also transforming economies and societies]{.underline}, and
generating new security challenges. Automation will lead to widespread
unemployment. The final realization of driverless cars, for example,
will put out of work millions of taxi, Uber, and long-haul truck
drivers. Populist movements in the West have been driven by those
disaffected by globalization and technology, and mass unemployment
caused by automation will further grow those ranks and provide new fuel
to grievance politics. Moreover, some fear that [autonomous weapons
systems will become "killer robots" that select and engage targets
without human input, and could eventually turn on their creators,
resulting in human extinction.]{.underline}

The [other technologies]{.underline} on this list similarly [balance
great potential upside with great downside risk]{.underline}. 3D
printing, for example, can be used to "make anything anywhere," reducing
costs for a wide range of manufactured goods and encouraging a return of
local manufacturing industries.61 At the same time, advanced 3D printers
can also be used by revisionist and rogue states to print component
parts for advanced weapons systems or even WMD programs, [spurring arms
races]{.underline} and weapons proliferation.62 Genetic engineering can
wipe out entire classes of disease through improved medicine, or [wipe
out entire classes of people]{.underline} through genetically engineered
superbugs. [Directed-energy missile defenses may defend against incoming
missile attacks, while also undermining global strategic
stability.]{.underline}

Perhaps [the greatest risk to global strategic stability]{.underline}
from new technology, however, [comes from the risk that revisionist
autocracies may win the new tech arms race]{.underline}. Throughout
history, states that have dominated the commanding heights of
technological progress have also dominated international relations. The
United States has been the world's innovation leader from Edison's light
bulb to nuclear weapons and the Internet. Accordingly, stability has
been maintained in Europe and Asia for decades because the United States
and its democratic allies possessed a favorable economic and military
balance of power in those key regions. Many believe, however, that
[China may now have the lead in]{.underline} the [new]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies of the twenty-first century, i[ncluding
AI, quantum, 5G, hypersonic missiles, and]{.underline} others. [If China
succeeds in mastering the]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nologies of
the future [before the democratic core,]{.underline} then [this could
lead to a drastic and rapid shift in the balance of power, upsetting
global strategic stability, and the call for a democratic-led,
rules-based system]{.underline} outlined in these pages.63

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its]{.underline} democratic [allies need to work with other]{.underline}
major [powers to develop a framework for harnessing
emerging]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology in a way [that
maximizes]{.underline} its [upside potential, while mitigating
against]{.underline} its [downside risks]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
also [contributing to]{.underline} the maintenance of **[global
stability]{.underline}**. [The existing]{.underline} international
[order]{.underline} [contains]{.underline} a wide range of [agreements
for harnessing]{.underline} the **[tech]{.underline}**nologies of the
twentieth century, [but they need to be updated]{.underline} for the
twenty-first century. The world needs an entire new set of arms-control,
nonproliferation, export-control, and other agreements to exploit new
technology while mitigating downside risk. [These agreements should seek
to maintain global strategic stability among the major powers, and
prevent the proliferation of dangerous weapons systems to hostile and
revisionist states.]{.underline}

NATO in Cyber and Outer Space

[[Cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} and space [[is a promising arena for NATO
to address China]{.mark} challenges [by building member state
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like the air and sea domains, as areas
that belong to no one state and which provide access to much of the
globe, [they form part of the global commons. C[ommand of the commons
has been the key enabler of]{.mark} the [US global]{.mark} position of
[power]{.mark}]{.underline} for many decades.26 However, [China wields a
sufficient range of]{.underline} sea, air, [cyber]{.underline}, and
space [capabilities such that the [global commons is now]{.mark} a
[contested]{.mark} zone.]{.underline} In contrast to the sea and air
domains, [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and space [[are sparsely
regulated. This lack of international norms enhances the risk of
conflict based on misperception, making NATO cooperation
**pertinent**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Adversarial activities toward the
US and Europe in]{.underline} the [cyber]{.underline} and space domain
[threaten transatlantic security]{.underline}. [[These come]{.mark} not
just from China, but also [from other adversaries such as Russia and
Ira]{.mark}n]{.underline}. Mechanisms for addressing these challenges in
the military sector are essentially generic and not, at least in their
basic design, established with a particular country in mind. Thus,
[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and space [[provide an avenue for NATO to
contribute significantly to deterrence of China without having to combat
major internal resistance]{.mark}. NATO would also benefit from
long-standing US-EU cooperation on cyber]{.underline} and space
issues.27

NATO has vowed to clarify Article Five's collective defense commitment
to encompass threats to satellites in space and coordinated
cyberattacks. NATO can design this effort to include adversarial
behavior from China. The alliance already has an array of instruments to
deal with cyber and space challenges from adversaries. These can be
extended to encompass China without pronouncing it a threat.28 This
approach allows the US and Europe time to adjust their cooperation to
take into account the fact that China poses military threats to them
both without explicitly using the language of threat at a time when NATO
members do not agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can
trigger Article Five responses.

Since the late 1990s, the vulnerability of shared space assets to
cyberattacks has been a concern for both the US and Europe. For example,
in 1998 a USGerman satellite, used for peering into deep space, was
rendered useless after it turned suddenly toward the sun, damaging its
High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA later determined that the
accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at the Goddard Space Flight
Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged as a major threat to both
the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For example, for about eighteen
minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom advertised erroneous network
traffic routes that instructed US and other foreign internet traffic to
travel through Chinese servers. Other servers around the world quickly
adopted these paths, routing all traffic, including government and
military traffic, to about 15 percent of the internet's destinations
through servers located in China.29

In the future, the need to enhance situational awareness in space is
likely to lead to further integration of space assets between the US and
its allies. Civilian entry points are likely to provide a growing
opportunity for infiltration. The weak state of cybersecurity in
civilian agencies should also be considered. Chinese military doctrine
prioritizes weaponry that targets vulnerabilities in the deployment of
US and allied power, such as the use of cyberattacks to disrupt
surveillance assets, intelligence networks, and command-and-control
systems.30 These threats are significant, since next generation systems,
including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and special forces, will not
function without access to space communication and space-derived data.

[Although European and US allies have]{.underline} indigenous space
[programs]{.underline} outside the NATO framework, [cyber
security]{.underline} and outer space [would be a useful field for joint
explorations of how to divert and manage attacks]{.underline} and
identify an agency which can coordinate transatlantic responses to
attacks. [Allies are embedded in a range of information networks which
may be disrupted, giving rise to alliance management
concerns]{.underline} emerging from attacks. [The [lack of red
lines]{.mark}]{.underline} regarding behavior in cyber and outer space
between the US and its allies [on one hand, and adversaries such as
China on the other, [adds to the risk of misperception and escalation,
and]{.mark} hence also [highlights the need for allied coordination to
avoid starting a war by mistake. An improved NATO dialogue on safeguards
and alliance consultation could also assist communication with
China]{.mark} on arms control and conflict prevention in
cyber]{.underline} and outer [space, which is not currently taking
place]{.underline}.

Looking to the future, [[NATO's success in establishing transatlantic
mechanisms for cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and outer space safeguards and
consultation [[will be crucial to allow NATO a key role in taking on the
China challenge in ways that help restore]{.mark} faith in [NATO's
credibility]{.mark} as a provider of collective defense in all domains.
It will also assist NATO in straddling the chasm between member states
prioritizing threats from either China, Russia, the Middle East, or
North Africa]{.underline}, since cyber and space threats potentially
stem from all of them, and the effectiveness of cyber and space defense
mechanisms do not necessarily depend on geographical origin.

Improved communication between NATO and the EU will be essential for
NATO to successfully address the military aspects of cyber and space
threats. The framework for permanent EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was
concluded in March 2003. It allows for the exchange of classified
information, the EU's use of NATO assets and capabilities for EU-led
crisis management operations, and the establishment of consultation
arrangements.31 Due to disagreements over responsibilities and
jurisdiction, however, meaningful coordination did not take place until
July 2016. On this occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration
stating their intention to work together on security and defense
responses to unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East
of the Euro-Atlantic area.32 During Biden's visit to Brussels in June
2021, [NATO promised to strengthen cooperation with the EU on promoting
peace and stability including protecting critical infrastructure,
strengthening resilience]{.underline}, maintaining a technological edge,
and addressing challenges to a rules-based order.33 The EU-US summit
statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support for robust
NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the partnership.34 At the
level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO and EU
officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies and
tactics for countering China challenges.35

The EU-US summit statement's negligible mention of cooperation with NATO
indicates that [[the ball is in NATO's court if strengthening NATO-EU
coordination is to take place]{.mark}.]{.underline} [French and German
concerns about entrapment are a major barrier to meaningful NATO-EU
cooperatio]{.underline}n. The area of [cyber]{.underline} and space
security [may allow NATO to work around this roadblock]{.underline}. In
line with the EU's practice of supporting the efforts of groups of
member states to take the lead on issues where EU institutions cannot
trump sovereignty, in the area of cybersecurity the EU has decentralized
implementation to work around national resistance. This has allowed the
EU to respond collectively and effectively to cyberattacks in Europe,
primarily through bolstering capacities and law enforcement
cooperation.36 However, the [EU is not yet a globally influential and
effective cyber-power because differences among member
states]{.underline} over issues such as whether to prioritize tech
sovereignty or Europe's global tech competitiveness prevent the EU from
acting in unison on the global stage.

The first US-EU TTC meeting held in September 2021 was an important step
in strengthening the EU's global position in cooperation with the United
States, and hence called into question whether NATO has a role to play
in cyber security.37 [The next couple of years will demonstrate whether
the EU and the US are able to focus on becoming mutually supportive
global cyber security guardians]{.underline} by cooperating on
strengthening investment screening, export controls, and rebalance
global supply chains in semiconductors. The successful implementation on
both sides of the Atlantic of the recommendations of the TTC working
groups will determine if transatlantic cooperation positions the US and
the EU as global partners in guarding cyber space. In part, this will
depend on the EU's ability to forge common positions that meet the US
halfway on issues such as tech sovereignty and data privacy, points of
contention through which transatlantic relations have been marred by
conflict.

[The [potential convergence of transatlantic views on cybersecurity
leaves room for NATO to play a significant role]{.mark} because the EU
is a civilian and economic, rather than military, set of
institutions]{.underline}. The NATO summit in Brussels in 2018 carved
out a role for NATO which the EU cannot fulfill, allowing NATO members
to integrate their sovereign cyber capabilities into NATO operations and
missions.38 However, compared to the EU's major role in cyber, NATO's
role is negligible. As EU civil-military cooperation ramps up in
enhancing Europe's autonomous defense profile while allowing US
companies a role in this effort, the union looks set to become an even
more dominant actor in transatlantic cyber defense. [[Because NATO is a
military organization, it has the procedures]{.mark} and instruments [to
position itself in a key role in coordinating and implementing the
military aspects of cyber defense]{.mark} between the US and Europe. The
multinational cybersecurity effort which is confronting the global
threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks involves NATO, the
EU, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, and sets NATO off to a good start
in enhancing its profile in countering Chinese challenges to
transatlantic cybersecurity]{.underline}.39 However, it remains to be
seen if it manages to deliver mechanisms that succeed in integrating
allied responses in the military sector in a way that complements US and
EU cyber defense initiatives.

In outer space, the EU is also increasingly active, recognizing the need
to deepen investments in areas such as satellite navigation, earth
observation, space situational awareness, and secure communications,
which are all central to enhanced space security. The EU has established
the EU Agency for the Space Programme, which has oversight over
everything the EU does in orbit as a bloc. Moreover, the EU uses the
European Space Agency (ESA) as technical advisor and industrial
procurement agent. This setup allows the EU to become more agile,
dynamic, and innovative in space as rapid industrialization is taking
place with US entrepreneurs and well-funded Chinese space programs in
leading roles.40 In the pipeline are a next generation of Europe's
satellite-navigation system, Galileo, and an extension of the scope and
capabilities of its Copernicus-Sentinel spacecraft, which monitors the
state of the planet. The EU focuses on ensuring that Europe has
independent space capabilities, but it does not develop instruments such
as space weapons systems.41

In the outer space realm, NATO has tremendous potential for playing a
key role in developing instruments in the military sector that involve
European and US space capabilities. NATO's decision to declare outer
space an operational domain at the London summit in 2019 is a first step
in allowing NATO an active role in addressing growing anti-satellite
threats from China and Russia.42 With the US as the leading power in
outer space and with the EU developing its space platforms to enhance
situational awareness and security, NATO has the tools to work out a
common transatlantic definition of the anti-satellite challenges that
need to be addressed. The establishment of mechanisms that ensure
coordination across military NATO commands regarding intelligence
gathering and the interface between cyber and space defense, as well as
civilian and military occurrences and initiatives, would potentially
strengthen the ability of allies to counter anti-satellite threats
considerably. As with cyber, NATO must first integrate the space issue
into all its organizational and operational structures, and secondly,
develop mechanisms that focus on coordination between US and European
capacities on the basis of a common understanding of the challenges to
be addressed.

#### D---[NATO]{.underline} is [critical]{.underline}---action [thwarts]{.underline} Chinese efforts to [undermine]{.underline} the liberal order, [shores up]{.underline} weak links in the alliance

[Washington increasingly looks to the EU rather than NATO]{.underline}
[for guidance on]{.underline} Europe's future [security
policy]{.underline}. [One reason is that [NATO's toolbox is lagging
in]{.mark}]{.underline} domains such as **[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and outer space, although cyber and outer space operations are key
enablers of actions in all domains including air, sea, and land. One
indication of this is the US-EU negotiations surrounding a common
response to cyber threats which took place during the first US-EU Trade
and Technology Council (TTC) meeting in Pittsburgh in September 2021. In
addition, during Trump's presidency, longstanding US dissatisfaction
with Europe's modest defense spending threatened to put NATO on the
backburner in transatlantic security debates.5 Since then, Russia's
invasion of Ukraine has elicited a sea change in German defense policy
with the announcement in February 2022 that defense spending will
increase to more than 2 percent of its gross domestic output annually.6
While this may be a convincing signal that Europe will finally devote
the resources required for its own defense and revive NATO's central
role in transatlantic security, there is also a risk that China will be
moved to the periphery of the alliance's agenda.

On February 11, 2022, during the runup to the Russian-Ukrainian war, the
Biden administration published its Indo-Pacific strategy as US Secretary
of State Anthony Blinken was in the midst of a Pacific trip to
Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii.7 This US prioritization signaled that
despite Moscow's war in Europe, Washington remains committed to
strengthening its presence in the Indo-Pacific and competing with China.
If the US drops the ball on the Indo-Pacific, Washington is concerned
that China might use force against Taiwan.8 Consequently, the key
question for the US is how many resources can be tied up in Europe
without losing sight of the long-term goal: deterrence of China. [[As US
strategic competition with China increases while NATO is sitting on the
fence, failure to develop a transatlantic defense policy that addresses
China will leave Europe vulnerable to China's ability to exploit the
weak links in European defense arrangements]{.mark}, which are newly
fragmented by the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}.

[EU efforts to build an independent regional defense profile and nurture
cooperation between Europe's defense industry and national defense
communities reflect a growing recognition that the region needs to
become a self-reliant defense a]{.underline}ctor. However, [Europe still
needs to demonstrate that self-reliance does not imply merely focusing
on Europe's periphery. Otherwise, the industrial challenges from China
may outcompete Europe's defense industry]{.underline}. Shipbuilding is a
case in point. By 2021, China built 50 percent of all existing ships in
the world. Through design collaboration agreements, cyber espionage, and
acquisitions, China has copied advanced innovative ship designs.
Enormous financial resources from the state allow Chinese companies to
enjoy economies of scale by building dual-use factories which not only
outcompete Western companies in the commercial shipbuilding industry,
but also threaten the production of navy vessels. [If not taken
seriously, Europe and the US may soon have no choice but to buy frigates
from China]{.underline}.10 [This example demonstrates the centrality of
China for global economic and [security developments]{.mark} and [should
encourage Europe to manifest a position of unified strength in defending
NATO member states against Chinese security challenges]{.mark}. This
realization will help convince the US and its adversaries that Europe
continues to be a credible partner in countering common threats against
transatlantic security, whether they appear in or beyond the European
region.]{.underline}

[[China's challenges]{.mark} to US and European security
[constitute]{.mark} such [common threats]{.mark} across a broad range of
sectors]{.underline}. [These include gradual [reinterpretations
o]{.mark}]{.underline}f principles [of [international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[subversion of]{.underline}]{.mark}
universal liberal [[market]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[practices]{.underline}, [and cyber insurgencies]{.underline}]{.mark}
[targeting]{.underline} a wide range of civilian and military entities.
[These]{.underline} Chinese [policies all have major military
implications because they are related to developments in the operating
principles, capabilities, and priorities of China's armed forces. [Only
NATO can offer an integrated transatlantic response to the military
aspects of Chinese policies]{.mark} that threaten those sectors across
the globe, including European actors. [NATO's involvement is essential
if the credibility of the alliance's security guarantees is to be
preserved and an effective response to China's encroachments on a
liberal rules-based order is to be established]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The omnipresent character of the China threat demonstrates that it is
long overdue for NATO to position itself as a significant player in
addressing Beijing's challenges to transatlantic security. NATO is key
to keeping US and European security policies coordinated when applying
mechanisms of deterrence and defense against Chinese challenges. If
transatlantic unity of purpose is lost, both the US and Europe are far
less likely to succeed in addressing China]{.mark}
sufficiently]{.underline}.

Compared to the United States, [[Europe took a long time to acknowledge
its stake in managing security challenges from
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Beijing pushed beyond its traditional
zones of interest in East and Southeast Asia toward the Indian Ocean in
the 2000s, US security policies began to focus more on China as
Washington sought a new geopolitical equilibrium in Asia.2 Since 2014,
France and the UK have spearheaded Europe's naval diplomacy to counter
the displays of force and increasing tensions in maritime Asia to which
China contributes. This engagement has focused on regular exercises with
the US and its Asian allies, operations in support of freedom of
navigation, and base-sharing agreements.3 In 2021, the EU recognized
that these geopolitical dynamics directly impact its security and
announced the establishment of supportive mechanisms in its Indo-Pacific
strategy.4 However, NATO has been conspicuously absent in these
transatlantic endeavors designed to counter challenges to US and
European security. [[Reflecting NATO's absence from the main arena of
US-China strategic competition, the alliance is hardly ever
mentioned]{.mark} in off-the-record conversations on Indo-Pacific
security between diplomats and think tank personnel.]{.underline}

[[NATO's reluctance to take on the China challenge is perhaps not
surprising, given its inherent assumption that the European continent is
the jewel in the crown of the US alliance system]{.mark}, which is
thought to guarantee US assistance in the event of a military threat
against Europe.]{.underline} This assumption was challenged during the
Trump administration, which openly questioned the US commitment to
Article Five's collective defense obligation. [The [invasion of Ukraine
has given NATO a new lease on life]{.mark} and put it at the frontlines
of transatlantic cooperation on deterring Russia from further military
action in future. However, [NATO's focus on its eastern frontline
carries the risk that the alliance turns into a Russia-focused European
institution and ignores that China is a global great power competitor
which also constitutes a major challenge]{.mark} to the security of all
[NATO member states]{.mark}.]{.underline}

lowlevel use of force. Certain other activities, which could be included
under the hybrid rubric, have been previously discussed under the
category of influence.101 The key point is that [all of these activities
are overseen by the CPC and the Chinese government]{.underline}, and,
while not necessarily entirely coordinated, are part of a generally
common approach.

Cyber: [China's use of cyber as an element of hybrid strategy is
well-established]{.underline}. The 2019 Worldwide Threat Assessment by
the Director of National Intelligence provided:

"[[China presents a persistent cyber espionage threat and a growing
attack threat to our core military and critical infrastructure systems.
China remains the most active strategic competitor responsible for cyber
espionage]{.mark} against the]{.underline} US [Government]{.underline}
(USG), [corporations, and allies. [It is improving its]{.mark} cyber
attack [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}...."102

As noted in the Department of Defense's (DoD's) "Annual Report to
Congress: Military and Security Developments Involving the People's
Republic of China 2019": "[[China has mobilized vast resources in
support of...espionage activities to acquire sensitive, dual-use, or
military-grade equipment]{.underline}]{.mark}."103 Media reports have
indicated that [DoD contractors and subcontractors have been
significantly affected by cyber attacks,]{.underline} and a public
report for the secretary of the navy states that the "system has
demonstrably failed."104 Additionally, among many other instances, China
engaged in the well-known cyber attack against the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), which resulted in the personal information of 22
million people being compromised,105 as well as attacks against managed
service providers and is under indictment for stealing proprietary
technology from US-based Micron Technology used to make dynamic random
access memory (RAM) chips.106 Numerous groups of Chinese hackers have
been identified as "advanced persistent threats" engaging in both
commercial and national security espionage.

### China Impact: Liberal Order---2AC

#### An uncontained China threatens the liberal order---it is an existential threat

But the similarities are becoming uncanny as [[a rising China begins to
pose a strategic challenge to the global system]{.mark} similar
to]{.underline} that of [the Soviet Union]{.underline}; as Biden frames
the conflict between the US and China in ideological terms (a clash
between democracy and autocracy); and as both sides show a willingness
to resort to all means necessary to achieve their goals short of a large
military confrontation, or a destructive "hot war".

[China has]{.underline} certainly [pulled ahead of Russia]{.underline},
which is trying to revive its old glory and influence by any means
necessary. President Vladimir Putin may play dirty games with the West,
but Xi is adamant about rewriting the rules of the game altogether.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s strongman [[rejects the
"international rules-based order]{.underline}]{.mark}" the West dictates
[[and insists on]{.underline}]{.mark} co-authoring the principles of [[a
new world]{.underline}]{.mark} order.

In other words, the US may downplay Moscow's provocations as the
desperate manoeuvres of a "regional power", but [[when it comes to
Beijing, it has no choice but to pay attention to this bullish and
bullying superpower]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[China has succeeded where it counts]{.underline}, where the Soviet
Union had failed -- [the economy]{.underline}. China's economy has
expanded at an incredible rate and, all things being equal, is destined
to surpass that of the US in this decade.

China is also developing a strategic doctrine and posture worthy of its
economic supremacy, and which includes conventional, naval, digital,
space and nuclear military power.

There are many ways to quantify the Chinese miracle, no less in
comparison with the US. But it suffices for our purpose here to take an
overall look at the century since the US emerged as a world power and
the Chinese Communist Party was first established, in 1921.

In its first half, China suffered from turmoil, disintegration, foreign
occupation and horrific famine that killed tens of millions, while the
US became a world superpower, comprising 40 to 50 percent of the world
economy.

China began to get its act together during the past 50 years, which
coincided with the US's recognition of the communist government and the
late President Richard Nixon's historical visit in 1972, the first by a
US president. But it was not until 10 years later that China began to
widely liberalise and industrialise its economy at a breathtaking pace.

Joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), in 2001, has propelled China
to global prominence as the "world's factory". In the following 20
years, the Chinese economy skyrocketed from the equivalent of 13 percent
of the US economy to 73 percent this year; a five-fold increase. In the
process, it pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty.

Furthermore, Xi's 2013 multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), spanning more than 60 countries, has ensured China's strategic
enlargement and geopolitical expansion like never before. Interestingly,
renewable energy investments reached a new high of 57 percent of BRI's
total for energy projects in 2020.

The US may have hoped that China's membership would mean cheap imported
goods and the moderation and democratisation of the Chinese government,
but eventually, China's ascension led to a \$300bn annual trade deficit
and the communist party tightened its grip on power, alas.

As the China miracle unfolded, US power has continued to unravel over
the past 20 years, beginning with the debacles of its wars in
Afghanistan, Iraq and the greater Middle East and through the 2008
financial crisis and the disastrous Trump presidency, as Washington lost
lots of assets, credibility, and influence among friends and foes alike
around the world.

In the process, the US's share of the world economy shrank by almost
half to 22 percent.

That is why [[Biden]{.underline},]{.mark} who urged Xi not to let their
competition veer into conflict, [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} tread
carefully after the summit ends to [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[US has the necessary geopolitical clout to deter a bellicose China
from making any aggressive moves]{.underline}]{.mark} in Asia and
beyond.

Likewise, it is incumbent on the Chinese leader, who is feeling
super-confident nowadays, to refrain from resorting to unsavoury means
or unnecessary threats that could escalate into a large confrontation
with dangerous consequences.

[[The world's]{.underline}]{.mark} wellbeing, indeed its [[**survival**,
depends on it]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### China Impact: Liberal Order---Internal

#### Chinese hybrid tactics disrupt the global order---cyber strategies and IP theft are a cornerstone of these efforts

**Speranza, Center for European Policy Analysis director, '20**

\[Lauren Speranza, Director, Trans-Atlantic Defense and Security, Center
for European Policy Analysis, "A Strategic Concept for Countering
Russian and Chinese Hybrid Threats," Scowcroft Center for Strategy and
Security, Atlantic Council, 7---20, p. 5-9\]

Similar to Russia, [[China seeks a world that is less dominated by the
US-led international system and gives China more
influenc]{.mark}e]{.underline} over global affairs. However, given its
history, governance model, geopolitical position, and relations with the
transatlantic community, China has a different worldview and strategic
endgame. [All Chinese policies are underpinned by the need to keep
the]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party (**[CCP]{.underline}**) [in
power.]{.underline} Beyond that, several long-standing Chinese
narratives impact China's foreign policy. One such narrative relates to
the "hundred years of humiliation" China experienced as its once-central
global role was diminished by a series of Western incursions in the
1800s.12 The CCP has leveraged this mentality, combined with the filial
piety between the Chinese state and its people, to keep China stable and
unified against external territorial, economic, political, and cultural
threats.13 With another core principle of "history as destiny," China
believes it will regain its stature as a powerful, respected actor in
the world and a benevolent overseer of its broader region.14 Described
by Chinese President Xi Jinping as the "Chinese Dream," this notion
underpins many of the government's maneuvers to expand its international
influence and reach. At the same time, China has traditionally preserved
a culture of peaceful coexistence, indicating it does not seek
aggressive expansion or view foreign interference in the same way as
other powers. Yet Chinese officials have manipulated this narrative to
support China "defending against threats" to its perceived regional and
global role, which the Chinese government defines at its discretion.15
Other factors, such as the unique role and leadership style of President
Xi Jinping and China's growing material capabilities, have also created
new dynamics suggesting China has shifted toward a much more assertive
role, as evidenced by its hostile actions in the South China Sea, for
example.16

In light of this, many experts argue that [[China seeks to
displace]{.underline}]{.mark}, or at least gradually adapt, [[the
current international system in order to return to its desired
role]{.underline}]{.mark}.17 Yet, such adaptation must be understood
with nuance. Indeed, China has benefitted from many of the current
order's features, such as Western capitalism, the Euro-Atlantic trade
order, and the US guarantee of free and secure trade routes. Rather than
disrupting or entirely displacing those aspects, [China wants to
manipulate them to fuel its own rise as a great power.]{.underline} Much
of China's strategy to do so involves working with willing nations
bilaterally where opportunities for investment and influence exist. This
is a necessary in Europe, where shared interests are ample, but where a
mismatch of values and political models limits the ceiling for
cooperation. Many European democracies desperate for investment from
Beijing are only willing to cooperate to a certain extent with communist
China. The EU has described it as follows.

["There is a growing appreciation in Europe that the balance of
challenges and opportunities presented by China has
shifted]{.underline}...China is, simultaneously, in different policy
areas, a cooperation partner with whom the EU has closely aligned
objectives, a negotiating partner with whom the EU needs to find a
balance of interests, an economic competitor in the pursuit of
technological leadership, and a systemic rival promoting alternative
models of governance."18

This realization and, subsequently, more restrictive policies toward
China are increasingly being adopted by EuroAtlantic countries and
institutions. Because China prefers to work through mechanisms in which
it has more control, this has driven it to create its own frameworks for
engagement in Europe and Eurasia, supported by its growing economic and
military might. As a result, [[China's moves]{.mark} to gain new
political and economic partners have begun to [undermine EU, NATO, and
transatlantic efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}.19 [This has led to the rise
of China's own kind of hybrid activities]{.underline}.

[[China's hybrid toolkit in Europe largely focuses on political and
economic coercio]{.mark}n to advance its objectives.
C]{.underline}hinese tools include: leveraging unequal trade
relationships with foreign countries to secure favorable terms for
China; making large foreign direct investments in strategic sectors,
prioritizing investments that give China access to European political
elites; and launching massive critical infrastructure projects at cheap
rates in foreign countries that connect China to European markets. These
projects overtly favor Chinese workers and industry and give China
control over operating the infrastructure, posing significant security
and geopolitical risks for the receiving country. China has also become
known for its use of "debt-trap diplomacy," which typically involves
giving large loans to vulnerable countries to support these big
projects, anticipating their inability to fulfill payment obligations.
When the country defaults on debt, China subsequently assumes control of
the projects, providing significant leverage beyond its borders. Much of
this is facilitated through China's self-promoting political frameworks
and initiatives such as 17+1 and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).20
By focusing on pragmatic cooperation on shared challenges and interests,
such as economic development, China uses these tools to build
relationships and further integrate itself with transatlantic countries,
despite differences on broader political issues. The [Chinese government
then uses those relationships to detract from the criticism against its
delinquency in other international obligations]{.underline} (e.g., human
rights, law of the sea), [and to manipulate political decision-making
inside institutions such as the EU.]{.underline}

[[China has also]{.mark} conducted a range of operational and cyber
hybrid activities, which have increased]{.underline} as political and
trade tensions have escalated between the United States and China. [This
has included the [cyber-enabled theft of]{.mark} US and European
[intellectual property]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for China's]{.mark}
commercial and **[tech]{.mark}**nological
[advantage.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Using coordinated hacking and
espionage efforts, [China has sponsored]{.mark} numerous [operations
against defense contractors]{.mark} and producers of civilian and
military technologies,]{.underline} such as aerospace, semiconductors,
and information technology, [[which China views as critical to future
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}. China reinforces these efforts by using
unfair practices related to industrial policy, such as forced technology
transfer, which mandates that US and European companies share their
technology to gain access to Chinese markets. Many academics have also
been subject to Chinese attempts at appropriating their work or
intellectual property.

When it comes to information operations, China has used its Confucius
Institutes across Europe and the United States to propagate Chinese
language, culture, and influence.21 Beyond this, China uses targeted
messengers--- whether diplomats in embassies around the world or Chinese
students studying abroad in Europe or the United States---to promote
misleading Chinese narratives in local, national, and social media.
China also uses these organizations and people as vehicles to invest in
media companies and partnerships, in hopes that they will favor and
share Chinese content, which often oversimplifies complex issues,
glorifies China, and misrepresents the truth.

Going forward, China's hybrid activities will be shaped by a number of
factors. First among these will be the aftermath of the coronavirus
pandemic. The Chinese government's management of the outbreak has
sparked sharp international criticism ranging from lack of transparency
to deliberate manipulation of the crisis for its own geopolitical
gain.22 Some argue that China's actions and geopolitical repositioning
around the coronavirus, including its suppression of key outbreak data
and propaganda initiatives to boost its authoritarian regime as a model
to respond to the crisis, are a prime example of its hybrid activities
at work.23 Coupled with massive economic losses, this could limit
China's political and economic ability to expand its influence in Europe
and abroad in the short term. In the longer term, however, China's
growth is expected to rebound, fueling renewed political and economic
forays into the global arena. Moreover, some experts argue that the
shocks from the pandemic crisis will hit democracies and the US-led
global system harder than communist China, allowing it to emerge as a
more influential world power than before.24

[**[A]{.mark}**nother [major factor that could affect China's course is
the transatlantic community's response to its hybrid actions.]{.mark}
Thus far, China's hybrid activities have been particularly challenging
to counter]{.underline} because some of the actions are currently
legitimate or legal, even if undesirable for transatlantic nations.
Additionally, as highlighted by the EU's strategic outlook referenced
above, many of these nations, including the United States, rely on China
as a critical trading partner, which makes some level of pragmatic
cooperation essential. For European nations, especially those struggling
financially and in dire need of investments and modernization, few
alternatives can compete with China's infrastructure and loan offers.
All of this has constrained a collective response. Nevertheless, as
evidenced by new strategic documents released by NATO, the EU, and
nations, [concerns over China's hybrid activities are growing, alongside
the political will to take action]{.underline}.25 In addition to recent
worries about the coronavirus, another major concern involves
Chinese-led infrastructure projects in Europe---from 5G
telecommunications networks and undersea cables to electric grids, power
plants, and nuclear projects---that utilize technology built by Chinese
state-run or subsidized companies. There is a growing belief among
transatlantic policymakers that the Chinese government could mandate
backdoor access to this infrastructure, which it could in turn
manipulate for espionage or other political purposes. [[As unity around
this issue grows, China could be forced to change some of its behavior,
but only if the transatlantic community can respond
effectively]{.underline}.]{.mark}

At the same time, China will seek to utilize its influence in countries
like Italy and Hungary to undermine European consensus on these issues.
To stay ahead of the curve, the transatlantic community needs a more
proactive and comprehensive counter-hybrid approach for China.

Since Russian and Chinese hybrid activities are directly linked to their
worldviews and grand strategies, limiting them, let alone causing
fundamental behavioral change, is difficult. Because Russian and Chinese
hybrid activities come with different motivations, tactics, and effects,
developing an overarching counter-hybrid strategy is all the more
challenging. Complicating this further is the potential for pragmatic
hybrid cooperation between Russia and China against the transatlantic
community. Moscow and Beijing have already sought to harmonize their
economic and military clout in pursuit of shared interests---for example
by using arms sales and joint military exercises to expand their
influence in Africa. Something similar could happen in Europe.
[[This]{.mark} difficult [threat environment makes a]{.mark}
**[proactive]{.mark}** and unified [**transatlantic** approach to hybrid
threats **increasingly** **important**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Today, [[China's rapid rise to challenge U.S. dominance of technology's
commanding heights has captured America's attention.]{.mark} The
rivalry]{.underline} in technology [is]{.underline} what the Director of
the Central Intelligence Agency, Bill Burns, spotlights as [the "main
arena for competition and rivalry with China.]{.underline}"5 [It [has
displaced the U.S. as the world's top high-tech
manufacturer,]{.mark}]{.underline} producing 250 million computers, 25
million automobiles, and 1.5 billion smartphones in 2020.6 Beyond
becoming a manufacturing powerhouse, [[China has become a serious
competitor in the foundational technologies of the 21st
century]{.underline}]{.mark}: artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, quantum
information science (QIS), semiconductors, biotechnology, and green
energy.7 In some races, it has already become No. 1. In others, on
current trajectories, it will overtake the U.S. within the next decade.

President [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[has declared,
"Technological innovation has become the main battleground of the global
playing field]{.underline}]{.mark}, and competition for tech dominance
will grow unprecedentedly fierce."8 Emphasizing the need to "develop
indigenous capabilities, decrease dependence on foreign technology, and
advance emerging technologies," the Chinese government's most recent
Five-Year Plan identifies key performance indicators, sets deadlines for
outcomes, and holds provincial and local governments accountable for
delivering results.9

One of America's most respected leaders in advancing and applying
technology, Eric Schmidt, who led Google to become one of the world's
leading technology companies, has been candid about his views. Noting
that "[many Americans still have an outdated vision of China," he
believes "the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [now faces]{.mark}
**a**n economic and military [competitor in China that is aggressively
trying to close our lead in emerging
technologies."]{.mark}]{.underline}[1]{.mark}0 In his assessment:
"Unless these trends change, in the 2030s we will be competing with a
country that has a bigger economy, more research and development
investments, better research, wider deployment of new technologies, and
stronger computing infrastructure."11

To take stock of the state of the technology race, this report examines
the progress made by the U.S. and China in each key technology over the
past 20 years.

To begin with our bottom lines up front:

• In the advanced technology likely to have the greatest impact on
economics and security in the decade ahead---AI---China is now a
"full-spectrum peer competitor" in the words of Eric Schmidt.

• In 5G, according to the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Board, "China is
on a track to repeat in 5G what happened with the United States in
4G."12 Despite advantages in 5G standards and chip design, America's 5G
infrastructure rollout is years behind China's, giving China a
first-mover advantage in developing the 5G era's platforms.

• In quantum information science, America has long been viewed as the
leader, but China's national push presents a clear challenge. China has
already surpassed the U.S. in quantum communication and has rapidly
narrowed America's lead in quantum computing.

• America retains its position of dominance in the semiconductor
industry, which it has held for almost half a century. But China's
decades-long campaign to become a semiconductor powerhouse has made it a
serious competitor that may soon catch up in two key arenas:
semiconductor fabrication and chip design.

• The U.S. has seven of the ten most-valuable life sciences companies,
but China is competing fiercely across the full biotech R&D spectrum.
Chinese researchers have narrowed America's lead in the CRISPR gene
editing technique and surpassed it in CAR T-cell therapy.

• Though America has been the primary inventor of new green energy
technologies over the past two decades, today China is the world's
leading manufacturer, user, and exporter of those technologies,
cementing a monopoly over the green energy supply chain of the future.
Consequently, America's green push relies on deepening its dependence on
China.

• [[China's whole-of-society approach is challenging America's
traditional advantages in]{.mark} the macro-drivers of the technological
competition, including its technology [talent]{.mark} pipeline,
[R&D]{.mark} ecosystem, [and national policies]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
As]{.mark} the National Security Council's Senior Director for
Technology and National Security Tarun Chhabra and the Center for
Security and Emerging Technologies have recognized, "The United States
is no longer the global science and technology (S&T) hegemon."

On 14 May 2021, China became the second country to have successfully
landed a rover on Mars after its Zhurong spacecraft touched down on the
surface of the red planet. Zhurong (祝融), carrying the name of the "god
of fire" in ancient Chinese mythology, was the sixth rover to land on
Mars, the first five managed by the American NASA Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. Although registering as a great success for China, Zhurong
received lesser global attention when compared to its American
competitor, Perseverance. Yet, [it heralds]{.underline} once again [that
China constantly gains more ground against competing with the U.S. even
in cutting-edge]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology alongside
other sectors.

[China is undisputedly becoming a]{.underline}
**[tech]{.underline}**nological [superpower and is]{.underline}
currently [undergoing the fastest expansion in world history despite
the]{.underline} recent [pandemic]{.underline} crisis. [One of the
reasons behind the phenomenon is that innovation is at the top of the
country's priority list]{.underline}.

In the year 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping set out clearly his
vision at the 19th CPC National Congress for China to achieve global
leadership in science and innovation by 2050. The government has been
leading the way for years, and the country's high-tech sectors are
developing at a rapid pace. At the congress, President Xi envisioned
China to become one of the world's most innovative countries by 2020 and
a leading global science and technology power by 2049. Surely, how much
of those goals China can be achieved in prescribed time is a matter of
debate. But in accordance with these objectives, it is evident that
[China prioritizes innovation in key]{.underline} generic
[technologies]{.underline}, cutting-edge frontier technologies, modern
engineering technologies, and disruptive technologies.

In the terms of Sino-American relationship, the [rigorous competition
between two major powers has already expanded to numerous
fields]{.underline}, from trade to the protection of cutting-edge
technologies and the formation of regional strategies. [Their
development models are supported by different values and
norms]{.underline}. The [increased intertwining of geopolitics
and]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology [reflects the underlying
intensification of competition]{.underline} between China and the United
States [and exacerbates the direct competition between the two powers
for control over the rules, norms, and institutions which will govern
international relations]{.underline} of the new world order in the
coming decades, [including]{.underline} high-technological developments
like **[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence [and
5G]{.underline}.

The political [leaders of both countries are well aware that
technological innovation is a strong source of national
power]{.underline}. As a result, **[tech]{.underline}**nology [is
now]{.underline} largely [politicized and has become a]{.underline} more
[prominent element of great power rivalry.]{.underline}

[There is no doubt that the U.S. is the technological superpower in the
world. But China is trying hard to seize this title]{.underline} from
it. It has grown very rapidly over the development and application of
the critical high tech areas such as artificial intelligence, big data,
robotics and 5G and likes and [there are concerns about whether China
would evolve into a new hegemonic superpower based on superiority in
high-tech]{.underline}.

### China Impact: Tech Dominance---Hegemony IL

#### Tech innovation is the cornerstone of leadership

**Thompson, Lexington Institute researcher '20**

"Why U.S. National Security Requires a Robus, Innovative Technology
Sector," Lexington Institute, 10---20, p. 3-6\]

Introduction: America is facing the most serious challenge to its
security in a generation.

Every nation strives for security. Although the phrase "national
security" in common usage has military overtones, there are other
elements as well--- economic, demographic, cultural. For instance,
energy security was a major concern of U.S. policymakers in recent
decades, and environmental

security related to climate change now garners similar interest.

What every facet of national security has in common, though, is that it
is shaped by technology. The wide oceans separating North America from
the Eurasian land mass were once thought to confer military security on
the republic, but long-range weapons altered the significance of
distance. The rapid rise of formerly poor East Asian nations has been
driven in large part by their mastery of technologies that did not exist
two generations ago.

**[Tech]{.underline}**nology [is]{.underline} thus [a **critical
driver** of national security]{.underline}, because [it is the variable
that determines the significance of **all the other
factors**]{.underline}. In the past, the United States was able to
sustain a culture of innovation that permitted it to lead the world in
advanced technologies. Now that may be changing as other nations pursue
investment initiatives aimed at dominating the global information
revolution. For example, the Chinese economy today generates as much
manufactured output as Germany, Japan and America combined, and that
output increasingly consists of advanced information technology.

This report is about the role that America's own technology sector plays
in bolstering national security. It is focused mainly on the defense
dimensions of America's strategic competition with China and other
nations, illuminating how [a robust and innovative]{.underline} domestic
**[tech]{.underline}**nology [sector can contribute directly and
indirectly to U.S. military dominance]{.underline}.

The United States has faced major challenges to its military security in
every generation since the 20th century began, and in each case new
technology was a key factor defining the danger. The threat posed by
imperialism at the century's beginning was closely associated with
development of the dreadnaught. The threat posed by fascism a generation
later was driven largely by the advent of air power. And the threat
posed by communism in the century's second half arose first and foremost
from nuclear weapons.

Unlike those earlier dangers, the **[tech]{.underline}**nological
[content of today's threat from other nations is grounded]{.underline}
largely [in commercial innovations--- innovations **readily adapted** to
new concepts of warfare. If]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is to **emerge** from]{.underline} this latest
contest [with its leadership position **intact**]{.underline}, as it did
in earlier rivalries, it [will have to **compete successfully** in
commercial markets]{.underline} through commercial enterprises. This is
not an "arms race" in the traditional sense, but [its **implications**
for America's **place in the world** are every bit as **serious** as the
**danger** posed by dreadnaughts and bombers in earlier
generations]{.underline}.

What is the technology sector, and why will it be central to national
security in the years ahead? The domestic technology sector is that part
of the national economy devoted to developing and exploiting new
information technologies. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was defined by
information hardware such as mainframe computers and semiconductors. The
definition later expanded to include enterprises focused on the
generation of software. More recently, it has come to encompass
companies whose business lines are enabled by the internet, such as
Google and Facebook.

It is not easy to define the boundaries of the technology sector,
because every segment of the economy now relies on digital innovations
and the internet to function. Hardware such as the smartphone is central
to the emerging information economy, but many tech companies are engaged
primarily in delivering services leveraged off of that hardware. For
example, Amazon has transformed marketing and logistics using an
internet-based business model, but it is mainly a provider of services
rather than hardware. It is, nonetheless, a technology-driven change
agent that is revolutionizing commerce.

The [military's interest in]{.underline} the
**[tech]{.underline}**nology [sector arises from the **fungibility** of
information innovations]{.underline} across all facets of human
activity. The same [processors]{.underline} and memory chips that enable
iPhones [can be applied to **smart weapons**,]{.underline} battlefield
[**communications**, and military **training**]{.underline} devices. The
same algorithms that facilitate machine learning in commercial products
can be used to operate unmanned attack drones and autonomous fighting
vehicles. And the "internet of things" that links disparate appliances
is a model for the joint connectivity the military seeks in wartime.

[There is]{.underline} a [**broad consensus** among military planners
that the industrial model of warfare]{.underline} spawned by 20th
century conflicts is [giving way to an information-driven model enabled
by new]{.underline} digital **[tech]{.underline}**nologies.
Collectively, these technologies allow warfighters to find, fix and
defeat threats faster than adversaries can, while minimizing dangers
arising from the fog of war such as fratricide. But the process of
innovation is unfolding at a furious pace, and America's military is
hard-pressed to keep up. In August of 2020, the chief of staff of the
Air Force released a strategy document aptly titled Accelerate Change Or
Lose.

The [fear among military planners is that a near-peer adversary might
use new]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nologies [to **leapfrog**
beyond the warfighting capabilities of **America'**]{.underline}s joint
force, exploiting technologies that barely existed when the current
force was conceived. In June of 2020, the Pentagon's director of
research and engineering issued a list of the highest-priority
technologies in which the military needed to invest. The top
technologies, in descending order of importance, were (1)
microelectronics, (2) 5G communications, (3) hypersonics, (4)
biotechnology, (5) artificial intelligence, (6) autonomy, and (7) cyber
technologies. Only one of these [technologies]{.underline} is
predominantly military in character; all the others [are mainly the
**products** of **commercial innovation.**]{.underline}

[They are also all]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nologies that
China [and other nations have disclosed plans to invest in
heavily]{.underline} as they strive to overtake the United States. So
[from a military perspective, the threat posed by new]{.underline}
information **[tech]{.underline}**nologies **[is twofold]{.underline}**.
On the one hand, the **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[might be overtaken]{.underline} and surpassed in operationalizing the
new technologies as tools for [gaining]{.underline} [military
advantage]{.underline} in future conflicts. On the other hand, if
[America cannot keep up in the race to innovate, it might eventually
lack the economic resources needed to sustain a global military
posture]{.underline}.

The U.S. government, and the Department of Defense in particular,
invests extensively in such technologies. However, it is widely
recognized that the private sector is where innovation in advanced
technologies occurs more quickly and more imaginatively. Government can
help industry to innovate with targeted funding, tax policy and other
exertions, but it cannot create a culture of innovation within the
public sector. That requires a structure of incentives that exists only
in the marketplace.

Conclusion: The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will
lose its status as the world's leading economic and military power if
its]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology [sector
falters]{.underline}.

This report began by noting that [tech]{.underline}nology [shapes every
facet of national security. It determines whether the nation possesses
sufficient]{.underline} economic [resources to compete w]{.underline}ith
other nations; [it impacts the quality of military equipment and
training; it shapes the ability of]{.underline} popular [culture to
influence]{.underline} the [values]{.underline} of other nations;
[it]{.underline} even [drives socio-economic trends]{.underline} that
are the foundation of who Americans are as a people. In short,
**[tech]{.underline}**nology [and the economic sector that produces it
are the most dynamic force driving the future of our
civilization]{.underline}.

Many, perhaps most, Americans understand this. However, for many years
the preeminence of American technology in the world has been taken as a
given. That pr[eeminence can no longer be assumed. China is working to
dethrone America]{.underline} from its status as the sole global
superpower, and so far every step it has taken to achieve that end has
been successful. If Washington does not rethink its policies, this may
be the last generation that can legitimately claim that America leads
the world in economic and military power. [Protecting]{.underline} the
culture of [innovation]{.underline} centered [in the]{.underline}
nation's **[tech]{.underline}**nology [sector is central to preserving
the American future.]{.underline}

its own citizens. [How much restraint would China show toward those it
deems "outsiders"?]{.underline}

important. [Competition with China need not lead to warfare]{.underline}
or even to a policy of containment like the framework that characterized
the U.S.--Soviet relationship during the Cold War. Nevertheless, it [is
a competition, and the side that innovates more effectively over time is
likely to win. The result will determine whether nations relate to each
other freely, equally, and peacefully, with a recognition of the human
rights of their citizens, or if they devolve into a system that
legitimizes authoritarianism and rewards power and
coercion]{.underline}.

Innovation, in particular, **[tech]{.underline}**nology-[based
innovation, is the key driver for both economic competitiveness and
national security]{.underline}. [Other nations]{.underline}, with
interests adverse to the United States, [recognize this
fa]{.underline}ct. In an increasingly interconnected world, nation
[states seek to accumulate innovation prowess, and hence economic
strength, as a key element of their geopolitical power]{.underline}.
Especially [savvy nation states]{.underline} also [pursue such
ends]{.underline} as a mechanism [to]{.underline} influence or [diminish
the national security and geopolitical power of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. There is no need to
inflict upon the world the carnage of war if one's geopolitical aims can
be achieved via alternative competitive means.

Several authors suggest [China's long-term ambitions include unseating
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[St]{.underline}**ates as
the world's economic and political leader.1

More compelling than opinions, [several]{.underline} United States
("U.S.") government and private [studies document a systematic and
coordinated effort by China to achieve **tech**]{.underline}nical [and
economic dominance]{.underline} through misappropriation of U.S.
technology.2 [These efforts are additionally supported by a companion
effort to weaken international economic institutions and norms designed
to protect U.S. intellectual property]{.underline} and free trade.3 The
Chinese tactics include illegal means, and sophisticated use of legal
means, to misappropriate U.S. technology and weaken the U.S. innovation
infrastructure including:

a\) Leveraging the open university and laboratory ecosystem via direct
sponsorship and engagement of Chinese nationals;4

b\) Devaluing U.S. positions in patents and technology platforms;5 and

c\) Accessing private sector U.S. technology through acquisitions and
ownership stakes in existing firms, funding of high-tech start-ups, and
forced joint ventures and other contractual agreements as a prerequisite
for entering the Chinese market.6

[This particular form of competitive strategy targeting the innovation
ecosystem in the United States is]{.underline} labeled by the Authors as
"[Innovation Warfare,"]{.underline}7 and it is defined as an executable
competitive strategy:

a\) Reflecting an innovation, intellectual property, and technology
strategy articulated and executed by the state (e.g. China);

b\) Using illegal means, political means, and legal economic
activities---of the type previously residing solely in the province of
commercial enterprise, to achieve the state's objectives;

c\) Employing these economic and innovation activities to achieve both
economic geopolitical power and to enhance military capabilities; and

d\) Functioning as a military, national security, and defense doctrine
not solely as a reflection of the state's economic policy goals nor
commercial competition in the ordinary course.

[Innovation Warfare does not just threaten American jobs and economic
prosperity. By simultaneously co-opting and weakening the innovation
capabilities]{.underline} of the United States, [China seeks to advance
its rise to world]{.underline} power. [China's prosecution of Innovation
Warfare not only encompasses a rejection of a rules-based international
order, but also poses an **existential** threat]{.underline}. [A world
where China dominates the]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nology
[landscape is not just about who earns the profits]{.underline} or
prevails in an abstract geopolitical fight. According to the National
Security Strategy of the United States of America ("National Security
Strategy"), [China pursues a world in which economies are less free,
less fair, and less likely to respect human dignity and
freedoms]{.underline}.8 [China's Innovation Warfare activities risk the
type of economic and geopolitical aggressions that were a root cause of
two World Wars]{.underline}.

#### Shifts in relative power cause war---miscalc

Factors that Could Lead to War Between the U.S. and China," THE

When China's foreign minister, Wang Yi, recently called for a reset of
bilateral relations with the United States, a White House spokesperson
replied that the US saw the relationship as one of strong competition
that required a position of strength. It's clear that President Joe
Biden's administration is not simply reversing Donald Trump's policies.

[Some]{.underline} analysts, citing Thucydides' attribution of the
Peloponnesian War to Sparta's fear of a rising Athens,
[believe]{.underline} the [US--China relationship is entering a **period
of conflict**]{.underline} pitting an established hegemon against an
increasingly powerful challenger.

[I am not that pessimistic]{.underline}. In my view, economic and
[ecological interdependence **reduces** the probability of]{.underline}
a real cold [war]{.underline}, much less a hot one, because both
countries have an incentive to cooperate in a number of areas. [At the
same time]{.underline}, **[miscalc]{.underline}**ulation is [always
possible and some see the danger of '**sleepwalking'** into
**catastrophe**]{.underline}, as happened with World War I.

[History is **replete** with cases of **misperception** about changing
power balances]{.underline}. For example, when US President Richard
Nixon visited China in 1972, he wanted to balance what he saw as a
growing Soviet threat to a declining America. But what Nixon interpreted
as decline was really the return to normal of America's artificially
high share of global output after World War II.

Nixon proclaimed multipolarity, but what followed was the end of the
Soviet Union and America's unipolar moment two decades later. Today,
[some Chinese analysts **underestimate** America's resilience and
predict Chinese **dominance** but this]{.underline}, too, [could turn
out to be a dangerous **miscalculation**]{.underline}.

[It is equally **dangerous** for Americans to over- or underestimate
Chinese power,]{.underline} and the US contains groups with economic and
political incentives to do both. Measured in dollars, China's economy is
about two-thirds the size of that of the US, but many economists expect
China to surpass the US sometime in the 2030s, depending on what one
assumes about Chinese and American growth rates.

Will American leaders acknowledge this change in a way that permits a
constructive relationship, or will they succumb to fear? Will Chinese
leaders take more risks, or will Chinese and Americans learn to
cooperate in producing global public goods under a changing distribution
of power?

Recall that Thucydides attributed the war that ripped apart the ancient
Greek world to two causes: the rise of a new power and the fear that
this created in the established power. The second cause is as important
as the first. The [US and China must avoid **exaggerated** fears that
could create a new cold or hot war]{.underline}.

[Even if China **surpasses** the US to become the world's largest
economy, national income is not the only measure of geopolitical power.
China ranks **well behind** the US in soft power and US military
expenditure is nearly **four times** that of China. While Chinese
military capabilities have been increasing]{.underline} in recent years,
[analysts who look carefully at the military balance conclude that China
will not,]{.underline} say, [be able to exclude the US from the Western
Pacific.]{.underline}

On the other hand, the US was once the world's largest trading economy
and its largest bilateral lender. Today, nearly 100 countries count
China as their largest trading partner, compared to 57 for the US. China
plans to lend more than US\$1 trillion for infrastructure projects with
its Belt and Road Initiative over the next decade, while the US has cut
back aid. [China will gain economic power from the sheer size of its
market as well as its overseas investments and development assistance.
China's overall power relative to the US is likely to
increase.]{.underline}

Nonetheless, balances of power are hard to judge. The US will retain
some long-term power advantages that contrast with areas of Chinese
vulnerability.

One is geography. The US is surrounded by oceans and neighbours that are
likely to remain friendly. China has borders with 14 countries, and
territorial disputes with India, Japan and Vietnam set limits on its
hard and soft power.

Energy is another area where America has an advantage. A decade ago, the
US was dependent on imported energy, but the shale revolution
transformed North America from energy importer to exporter. At the same
time, China became more dependent on energy imports from the Middle
East, which it must transport along sea routes that highlight its
problematic relations with India and other countries.

The US also has demographic advantages. It is the only major developed
country that is projected to hold its global ranking (third) in terms of
population. While the rate of US population growth has slowed in recent
years, it will not turn negative, as in Russia, Europe, and Japan.
China, meanwhile, rightly fears 'growing old before it grows rich.'
China's labour force peaked in 2015 and India will soon overtake it as
the world's most populous country.

[America]{.underline} also [remains at the **forefront** in
key]{.underline} **[tech]{.underline}**nologies (bio, nano and
information) [that are **central** to 21st-century economic **growth**.
China is **investing heavily**]{.underline} in research and development,
and competes well in some fields. [But 15 of the world's top 20 research
universities are in the US; none is in China.]{.underline}

Those who proclaim Pax Sinica and American decline fail to take account
of the full range of power resources. American hubris is always a danger
but so is **[exaggerated]{.underline}** [fear]{.underline}, which [can
lead to **overreaction**]{.underline}. [Equally **dangerous** is rising
Chinese nationalism, which,]{.underline} [**combined** with a belief in
American **decline**, leads China to take **greater risks.** Both sides
must beware of **miscalcu**]{.underline}lation. After all, more often
than not, [the **greatest risk** we face is our own **capacity for
error.**]{.underline}

[[Beijing is a remarkably ambitious revanchist power]{.mark}, one
[determined to make China whole]{.mark} again by "reuniting"

increasingly [encircled, and faces growing resistance]{.mark} on many
fronts---[just the sort of scenario that has led it to lash out in the
past.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The historical record since the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949 is clear: [When confronted by a mounting threat to its
geopolitical interests, Beijing does not wait to be
attacked]{.underline}; it shoots first to gain the advantage of
surprise.

In conflicts including the Korean War and clashes with Vietnam in 1979,
China has often viewed the use of force as an educational exercise. It
is willing to pick even a very costly fight with a single enemy to teach
it, and others observing from the sidelines, a lesson.

Today, [[Beijing might be tempted to engage in this sort of aggression
in multiple areas. And once the shooting starts, the pressures for
escalation are likely to be **severe**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### China Solvency: NATO Action

#### NATO coordination enables coalitions of the willing within the alliance to solve the Chinese hybrid threat

**Speranza, Cetner for European Policy Analysis researcher, '20**

\]Lauren Speranza, Director, Trans-Atlantic Defense and Security, Center
for European Policy Analysis, "China Is NATO's New Problem," FOREIGN
POLICY, 7---8---20,

accessed 5-7-22\]

Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested billions of
dollars throughout Europe---buying up critical infrastructure and
increasing Beijing's political clout across the continent. As Chinese
firms, often with strong ties to the state and Chinese Communist Party
(CCP), acquire parts of sensitive ports, pipelines, and
telecommunication networks, China's incursions into Europe's security
umbrella are drawing serious concern.

But NATO, long worried about Russia, has largely been silent on China.
Now, that is changing. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power. It's apparent that NATO can no longer ignore the
threat. If the alliance hopes to remain competitive, it will need to
develop a new strategy for dealing with Beijing.

First, [NATO needs a common assessment of [China's hybrid
threats]{.mark}---]{.underline}a mix of diplomatic, economic, security,
information, and technological actions designed to quietly undermine
democratic states and institutions to Beijing's benefit while avoiding a
traditional conflict. While China's conventional military threat in the
Indo-Pacific is far from NATO's borders, its hybrid activities are
happening in the alliance's own backyard.

[Cyber-espionage, intellectual property theft, infiltration of critical
infrastructure, debt manipulation, and disinformation are prime
examples.]{.underline} W[hile these threats may seem to fall outside of
NATO's purview, they [pose **serious** **security** **risks** for the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, China's desire to invest in
Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may not look like a problem for NATO on its
surface. But its investments have worrying strings attached that give
China operating control over the infrastructure. That control could
decrease allies' willingness to move military forces---including
sensitive technologies---through the port and its surrounding networks.
This could lead to disrupted planning and fewer military exercises,
decreasing NATO's ability to defend the Baltic States during a crisis
with Russia. This could also open the door for pragmatic collaboration
between China and Russia to undermine trans-Atlantic security.

[Allies need to forge a shared understanding of these risks through
information-sharing and dialogue]{.underline}---no small feat for
countries that do not see eye to eye on China. Some are even willing to
ignore such vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or disenchantment
with trans-Atlantic institutions. The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has a **critical** role to play in
getting allies on the **same page**]{.mark} [and setting common goals
for countering China's hybrid activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, [NATO needs to focus on public diplomacy]{.underline}. NATO has
an important role to play in the battle against the CCP's global
narratives, which Beijing promulgates through hybrid activities. To
defend the trans-Atlantic values on which the alliance is
built---freedom, democracy, rule of law, and human rights---NATO should
clearly communicate China's violations of these principles and its
propaganda efforts to cover them up. (These include, among others, human
rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang and violations of the
U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea in the South China Sea.) NATO
should also enhance its outreach to key partners in the Indo-Pacific,
such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, which can serve
as important counterweights to Chinese influence in the region.
Effective public messaging also means getting serious about attributing
the blame for attacks, as the European Commission recently did over
Chinese disinformation around COVID-19, to raise the pressure on Chinese
officials. Trans-Atlantic countries have struggled to shape China's
behavior because they cannot prove malign intent or agree to call out
Beijing for its subversive efforts. Allies should develop clearer
guidelines---what needs to be proved, by whom, and to what degree---to
enable collective attribution. NATO is strongest when it speaks with one
voice. It should use that voice to demand transparency and change from
China.

Third, the alliance should step up its counteroffensive. [China's hybrid
actions intentionally blur the lines between what is legally
permissible, politically inappropriate, and downright
escalatory]{.underline}.

[This makes it difficult for leaders to determine appropriate responses,
producing a reactionary approach]{.underline} thus far. But [an
intensifying geostrategic competition has already begun. To
compete]{.underline} in this environment, [[the trans-Atlantic community
needs a more proactive approach. Rather than
waiting]{.underline}]{.mark} for China to invest in the next major
European port, [allies should coordinate]{.underline} legislation to
prevent the riskiest Chinese acquisitions. And rather than waiting for
more Chinese cyberintrusions, [[allies should collaborate on
responsible, targeted]{.underline}]{.mark} offensive
[[cyberactions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Over time, [this would help
dissuade China from manipulating investments in critical infrastructure,
conducting cyber-espionage, and other hybrid activities]{.underline}.
While adopting a more offensive posture remains controversial among
certain allies[, it is gaining traction across Europe and is strongly
supported in Washington. Although NATO, as a defensive alliance, should
not implement such a counteroffensive, [policymakers should leverage it
as the primary forum to coordinate actions]{.mark} among willing
nations.]{.underline}

Fourth, [[NATO needs to deepen its cooperation with other key players,
such as the]{.mark} **[E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion
[and]{.mark} the [private sector]{.mark}]{.underline}. Where NATO lacks
the mandate and means, the EU and multinational businesses play critical
roles in developing, implementing, and enforcing the legislation and
financial incentives necessary to counter Chinese hybrid threats.
Complementary to that, NATO and its allies can focus on providing
intelligence, defending cyberspace, developing capability targets for
new technologies, conducting exercises and contingency planning,
informing resilience requirements for secure infrastructure, and
bolstering deterrence. Despite the political obstacles that impede more
formal NATO-EU cooperation, allies should look to the European Centre of
Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki to bring together
NATO and EU staff, national officials, and industry voices in one place
to align their counter-hybrid policies for China.

[The Chinese government's [manipulative efforts around]{.mark} the
**[corona]{.mark}**virus [have thrust China's hybrid activities to the
center of trans-Atlantic debates. Policymakers need to seize the moment
and respond by "using NATO more politically]{.mark}]{.underline}," in
Stoltenberg's words[. NATO is first and foremost about its nations. In
the fight against China's hybrid threats, these nations bring much more
to the table than military power alone. [They have access to a broad
range of tools]{.mark}]{.underline}---military, political, economic,

While [[China]{.underline}]{.mark} does not pose a direct military

**competitor**]{.mark} politically, economically and in seeking
dominance in digital military technologies]{.underline}.
[[Europe]{.mark}, the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and

#### Allies and our tech edge are vital to staying ahead of China

[[When it comes to the]{.mark} undeclared **[Tech]{.mark}**nology [War
between the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and China,
there is]{.mark} a lot for Americans [to be worried
about]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Beijing seems to have the advantage]{.mark} in several key
areas]{.underline} which is causing a great deal of consternation in
Washington.

[[The U.S. rival has become adept at industrial espionage]{.mark} and is
stealing billions of dollars worth of intellectual
property]{.underline}.

China has a command economy and long-term vision on where it wants to be
in regards to technology development. It doesn't have to contend with
hyper partisanship and delayed budgets.

The nation is cornering the markets on raw materials, particularly
strategic minerals needed for advanced technologies.

And it has a seemingly unending pile of money to invest in emerging
technologies that may give its military --- and economy as a whole --- a
winning edge.

[But [there is one thing]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has in abundance that China is sorely lacking:]{.mark} friends and
[allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

U.S. military leaders often say that the
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[does not go to war alone --- it fights alongside]{.mark} friends and
[allies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This special report is devoted to the notion that [the military
research-and-development community must adopt the same approach. [It
must form partnerships with allied nations to develop the cutting edge
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} needed to stand against China's goals
of hegemony in the Indo-Pacific.

And while this is a defense magazine, our editorial stance has been that
[it's myopic to look at the rivalry with China solely through the lens
of military technology. [China has clearly stated goals to advance the
development of a host of commercial and dual-use technologies]{.mark}
that it could employ to dominate both battlefields and commercial
sectors, thus making it a global leader and economic powerhouse,
[potentially leaving the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[and its allies behind.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The U.S. needs to lead in threat assessment of China's hybrid activities---vital to solving

accessed 5-22-22\]

But NATO, long worried about Russia, has largely been silent on China.
Now, that is changing. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power. It's apparent that NATO can no longer ignore the
threat. If the alliance hopes to remain competitive, it will need to
develop a new strategy for dealing with Beijing.

First, [[NATO needs a common assessment of China's hybrid
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}---a mix of diplomatic, economic, security,
information, and technological actions designed to quietly undermine
democratic states and institutions to Beijing's benefit while avoiding a
traditional conflict. While [[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} conventional
military threat in the Indo-Pacific is far from NATO's borders, its
[hybrid [activities are happening in the alliance's own backyard.
Cyber-espionage, intellectual property theft, infiltration of critical
infrastructure]{.mark},]{.underline} debt manipulation, [[and
disinformation are prime examples]{.underline}]{.mark}. While these
threats may seem to fall outside of NATO's purview, [[they pose
serious]{.mark} security [risks for the alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For instance, China's desire to invest in Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may
not look like a problem for NATO on its surface. But its investments
have worrying strings attached that give China operating control over
the infrastructure. That control could decrease allies' willingness to
move military forces---including sensitive technologies---through the
port and its surrounding networks. This could lead to disrupted planning
and fewer military exercises, decreasing NATO's ability to defend the
Baltic States during a crisis with Russia. This could also open the door
for pragmatic collaboration between China and Russia to undermine
trans-Atlantic security.

[[Allies need]{.mark} to forge [a shared understanding of these risks
through information-sharing and dialogue]{.mark}---no small feat for
countries that do not see eye to eye on China]{.underline}. Some are
even willing to ignore such vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or
disenchantment with trans-Atlantic institutions. [The
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has a critical role to play in
getting allies on the same page and setting common goals for countering
China's hybrid activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The U.[S. and Europe will be stronger if they work together on a
strategy toward China]{.mark}. [They should capitalize on their

require the Biden administration to restore trust in the transatlantic
relationship. It will also require Europe to unite around tougher
policies where it sees China infringing on European values and
interests.]{.underline}

[[Only together can the U.S. and Europe build the leverage necessary in
trade, technology and multilateral engagement to hold China to a set of
standards that protects democratic societies and contributes to global
stability.]{.mark} United they can rally other nations around these
objectives]{.underline}.

[[Both sides of the Atlantic are converging in their assessment of the
challenges China poses to transatlantic prosperity and
democracy]{.mark}. The U.S. and Europe must now build on this

the necessary leverage in trade, technology and multilateral engagement
to hold China accountable to a set of standards that protects democratic
societies and contributes to global stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[To develop a stronger transatlantic approach toward China, the Biden
administration must work to rebuild trust in the transatlantic
relationship and recommit to multilateral alliances and
institutions]{.underline} abandoned by President Trump. Europe for its
part must unite and take action where it sees China exploiting its
critical industries and infringing on its values. A common position on
China at the EU--level and across several influential EU member states
is critical to making transatlantic cooperation on China feasible.

### China Solvency: Resilience---China Espionage

#### Resilience measures help address the China cyber espionage threat

C. Security---Hybrid and Conventional Military

[[In the security arena]{.mark},]{.underline} assurance,
[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, and deterrence [measures [will be
necessary to respond to]{.mark} both [hybrid and conventional challenges
posed by China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

1\. Hybrid: [[China's hybrid activities include cyber]{.underline}
[espionage]{.underline}]{.mark}, economic coercion, and low-level use of
force. Many of the response options include military activities, but it
is worth underscoring that US military leaders uniformly support strong
diplomatic efforts.

a\. Countering cyber espionage

[Chinese cyber espionage has been significant]{.underline} even apart
from the issues raised by Huawei in conjunction with the establishment
of 5G networks. No complete solution can be expected, but [[significant
benefits can be achieved by enhancing resilience and raising the cost of
cyber intrusions. Cybersecurity issues are not limited to China. Russia,
North Korea, Iran]{.mark}, and criminal and terrorist organizations
likewise [are significant threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} Accordingly, a
[[cyber response to China will necessarily be part of a larger
cybersecurity effort]{.mark}, though certain parts of an overall
approach could be China-directed.]{.underline}

[[Accomplishing cybersecurity objectives requires a multifaceted
approach, including]{.underline} 1) [development and deployment of
advanced technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} and critical capabilities
such as cloud technologies, automation, and AI; 2) [[public-private
"coordinated partnerships"]{.underline}]{.mark} for protection of
confidential government and business information as well as key critical
infrastructure arenas; 3) significant governmental efforts that include
resources; 4) legal remedies and sanctions to ensure that cyber
intrusions provide no benefits; 5) appropriate use of the US doctrine of
"persistent engagement and defending forward"; and 6) like-minded
countries working together via an International Cyber Stability Board.
Countries with more significant cyber capabilities will have greater
success in dealing with Chinese cyber activities, so Multi-vector
international coordination to enhance cybersecurity capacity can have
significant value.210 The recently enacted Asia Reassurance Initiative
Act of 2018 (ARIA) specifically authorizes \$100 million annually for
cybersecurity cooperation to "strengthen resilience against
cyberattacks, misinformation, and propaganda" and to "strengthen the
resilience of critical infrastructure."211 These arenas are generally
understood by each country in the region, but practical cooperation
needs to be enhanced.

[Overcoming vulnerabilities and enhancing cybersecurity resilience will
require multiple steps]{.underline}. In dealing with its own
vulnerabilities, the US government is shifting its approach of
increasing resilience to greater use of cloud technology provided by
expert firms and supported by other advanced capabilities such as AI and
automation. Further actions should include providing a standard
"resilience architecture" for contractors and subcontractors, and
necessary additions of cybersecurity personnel and budgetary funding to
the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the DoD.212

[A comparable approach is required for the private sector]{.underline}.
Most organizations do not have the expertise or resources to provide
effective cybersecurity, and will, therefore, benefit greatly from
utilizing cloud technology run by experts for data storage and provision
of services. Businesses, of course, have to connect to the cloud and
protect information at their own sites. This can be done through
"software defined networks," which are one of the developing advanced
technologies, as well as the employment of expert firms that can monitor
and respond to activities on a business's networks. To help assure the
requisite expertise, the government could create a certification
approach, including the frameworks for effective "resilience
architectures"---though, since cyber is a highly dynamic arena, it will
be important not to create a checklist, but rather adopt a
performance-oriented approach.

There are a variety of ways to organize international interactions. A
valuable starting point would be organizing around like-minded countries
and organizations, including through the establishment of an
International Cyber Stability Board.213 Such a board could focus on
provision of protection and resilience to key cross-border critical
infrastructures, including finance and transportation; undertake a
multinational campaign response to malignant cyber actions by a
significant nation state and criminal threats; and enhance capabilities
to defend against armed attack, including with allies and close
partners. It is important to recognize that technology is not the only
way to deal with cyber attacks. Legal remedies, including the use of
sanctions, freezing of assets, and forfeitures can have a key role. Such
actions can have greatest effect when coordinated at a multinational
level.

3\. Security

In the security arena, [[undertaking]{.underline}]{.mark} assurance,
[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, and deterrence [[measures will be
necessary when responding to]{.mark} both [hybrid]{.mark} and
conventional [challenges. The most significant unresolved challenge is
in the cyber arena where China has utilized its capabilities to steal
advanced technologies and to undertake continuous attacks,]{.mark}
including through "advanced persistent threats," and]{.underline} where
the expansion of technology from China's Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.
into the 5G arena will significantly increase security risks for users
of this technology.

a\. Hybrid

[[In the hybrid arena]{.mark}:]{.underline}

■ [[for cyber, undertake expanded development of resilience
capabilities, create an International Cyber Stability Board]{.mark} of
like-minded nations to [respond to ongoing Chinese cyber
campaigns]{.mark}]{.underline}, place limits on the use of Chinese
technology as key elements in national information technology
infrastructures, and establish additional legal remedies focused on
denying benefits to those using illegally obtained information;

■ responses to economic coercion should include a governmental review of
technology transfers to reduce pressure on companies, coordinated
diplomacy to generate multilateral objections to any such actions
against a single country, and evaluation of the creation of backup
financial mechanisms to ameliorate economic cutoffs by China;

■ Chinese attempts to limit free speech, particularly outside China or
by non-Chinese entities, should be met with diplomatic support,
countervailing economic actions including sanctions, and by civil
society groups monitoring and making public inappropriate censorship
activities; and

■ opposition to low-level use of force will require security activities
in the East and South China Seas, including diplomatic support, freedom
of navigation activities, and expansion of maritime initiatives to
provide intelligence that includes a common maritime picture, and
capabilities and training.

#### NATO-grounded resilience policies spur technological innovation

Development, Defense and Innovation at NATO," JOURNAL OF INNOVATION AND
ENTREPRENEURSHIP v. 8 n. 12, 2019, p. 3-5\]

[Cyber-security is yet to be globally, legally, operationally, and
strategically defined]{.underline}. The scale of a security perspective
is more attractive at this time considering the geostrategic challenges
and threats. The possibility of innovation and entrepreneurship in the
field is also a tangible reality, due to the necessary research and
development methods. More so, the possibility of an open market economy
sharing of knowledge and technological skills makes security and
cyber-security or defense for that matter more attractive. What lacks in
the world wide legal and political framework of operations, exchange of
information and protectiveness from new sources or methods that can be
deemed as elements of infiltration.

The article's aim is to examine and recommend a global strategic
framework for operational capacity and management resilience between
allied and cooperative partners in the field of cyber-security. The
current article is a follow up of prior scientific publications made in
2014 first and later in 2018, on NATO's cyber-security strategy,
presented through a framework of Cyber-Development, Cyber-Democracy, and
Cyber-Defense (Carayannis, Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2014; Carayannis,
Campbell & Efthymiopoulos, 2018). The aim is to converge diversified
information on cyber-security, in a single strategic framework; reflect
to the actual practical needs in understanding operations and tactical
ability to deliver in multi-complex and dimensional world through
management and operational efficiency capabilities. The article requests
interoperability of aims and objectives under a global framework of
cyber-security; through a strategic framework on cyber-security, global
law can be proposed, defined, and adopted by the international
community. The strategic framework will define structures that are
needed to be put in place on a global scale, when reflecting issues of
cyber-security and inclusive for NATO. It will define threats and
challenges, as cyber-attacks are real. Cyber-security is not an
asymmetrical or hybrid threat, but an existential one. Its destructive
capacity can be multi-leveled and can also lead to human casualties. The
future of e-safety lays at both a global estimation framework of what
constitutes cyber-security and how we react to it; it lays in between
cooperation of allies and members of wider alliances, against specified
or approximate threats. Yet, its framework of aims and objectives,
management, command and control, and operations will be defined and
decided by allied parties only such as is the case of NATO.

Operationally, national and cooperative forces need to be continuously
agile and technologically advanced. In an asymmetrical world, which is
complete with unforeseen challenges and threats, we need forces with
flexibility, adaptability, operational and strategic command structure,
based on high technologically sophisticated information "coming in," but
also being used while in training or through active operations.

On a theoretical scale, the current article requests a cyber-security
strategic framework adoption of resilient adaptability and
interoperability policy in the framework of safety and defense. The
article considers that understanding the realities of threats is by
definition a natural innovation and as we move ahead, we structure and
operate a single strategy on cyber-security against a virtual threat
from wherever it comes from. Its long-term resilience may be more
complex as operational capacity needs to constantly develop and adapt
into the convergence of societal structures, and methods; where
socio-economic, technological, defense even health, and education issues
are affected.

[When [theory]{.mark} on cyber-security, resilience, and operational
capacity will be applied at NATOs level, it [will enable allies]{.mark}
and members, jointly, [to create a true policy and strategy for
cyber-security resilience against hybrid]{.mark} virtual
[threats]{.mark}.]{.underline} The methodology on how to is presented
through this current article.

The article's design is based on cross-disciplinary and
interdisciplinary approaches. It combines elements of global security
and strategy, national and international law, economic development, and
technological research and advancement and most importantly is
innovative and entrepreneurial; its understanding will enable us to
comprehend global and regional market establishment and convergence, as
also economic changes.

The setting of the study required lapse of time to showcase the need and
the necessity of the subject. Current output reflects a set of written
analyses, rules, and primary experiences. It methodologically acquired
sources of information of related necessity and relevance, shaped the
understanding, and need to point out for a framework of rules,
regulations, management, and operations on cyber-security.

The article and its author frames a specific policy recommendation with
regards to the creation of not only a regional alliance (NATO-based
scale), Cyber-Security Strategy for the twenty-first century but a
global one. The article defines the "dynamism" of cyber-security both as
a topic and subject. Cyber-security is a twenty-first century element of
policy orientation; a necessity for both collective and individual
defense and security resilience.

In specific, [[a cyber-security strategy for NATO will enhance its
innovation and creativity]{.mark} core of operations and methodologies
[against any kind of]{.mark} virtual threats. [It will set standards,
policy procedures, and recommendations. NATO's strategy]{.mark} of
cyber-security]{.underline} through its new Cyberspace Operations
Centre, in Mons (Belgium) as decided in the Brussels Summit of July 2018
(Cyber-Space Operations Center Mons Belgium, 2018) [[unfolds options and
opportunities, innovation, and entrepreneurship in operations efficiency
and capabilities application. Current technological advancements and
dynamisms through innovation and sustainable futuristic advancement will
soon be evident.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The challenges posed by China to the alliance are not new. Already in
the last ten years, [allies have been grappling with issues of foreign
investment into strategic industries and critical infrastructure,
imbalanced trade relationships with China, influence operations and
disinformation, and the problem of technology transfer to
China]{.underline}.

However, [the increasing assertiveness by]{.underline} the PLA and
[China's increasingly forceful and at times aggressive diplomatic
tactics]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific, [as well as its increasingly
authoritarian turn at home, have heightened awareness in the alliance.
The war in Ukraine made it clearer that the alliance will need to think
carefully about how to balance its focus on maintaining security in the
Euro-Atlantic region with any potential role in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. However, [there is scope for the
latter.]{.underline} Members should continue to improve information
sharing and assessing Chinese investment in their economies, within the
alliance as well as with partners in the Indo-Pacific region. [[Allies
should build a stronger common approach to domestic Chinese challenges,
such]{.mark} as in national critical [infrastructure, keeping an
innovative edge, and resilience needs to be addressed]{.mark} first [to
enable the alliance to ensure both political and military security.
Doing so is not just in NATO's internal interest but of benefit to its
engagement with the Indo-Pacific region and to setting common standards
with partners outside of the alliance, particularly in areas of
defence-relevant disruptive technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is
scope for NATO to be a platform to engage with China, too, on areas of
key interest, such as arms control. However, on this last point,
expectations should be measured.

NATO [member states should prioritize jointly building at home future
technologies that will underpin military
capabilities]{.mark},]{.underline} such as quantum computing, artificial
intelligence, and 6G. Allies will need to begin developing AI technology
and its regulations in concert to ensure that systems remain
interoperable, and that China does not secure the upper hand in this
pivotal technology.25

To maintain their competitive edge, [[allies]{.mark} will [need to
increase and protect U.S. and European joint
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The alliance should prioritize securing
supply chains and ensuring procurement processes that prevent Chinese
goods from inclusion in mission-critical tools. Further, NATO should
participate in export control dialogues with EU member states to ensure
that semiconductor manufacturing equipment and other foundational
technologies are controlled multilaterally. As part of this effort, NATO
should coordinate with the EU to establish baseline risk assessments for
the adoption of critical technologies from Chinese providers, such as
5G, to ensure that risk mitigation strategies are developed and
implemented with possible military use in mind.

NATO and Cyber Industry Cooperation

[Cybersecurity is]{.underline} largely [market-driven. Government
intelligence capabilities increasingly find it hard to keep up with the
requirements for combating the surge in cyber threats. [NATO should play
a crucial role in facilitating contacts between those member states that
seek stronger links with the private sector and encourage the role that
industry can play in cyber threat deterrence and intelligence
sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Flagship initiatives]{.underline}, such
as the NATO Industry Cyber Partnership, [are important
steps]{.underline} in that direction [but there is still a need to build
more access and trust between NATO governments and industry. Educating
member states and partner nations about the role of the private sector
in cybersecurity is key. To make the partnership with the industry more
effective [NATO could play a more important role in mapping and
evaluating what kind of cyber defense technologies and intelligence
gathering methods the private sector offers, share lessons]{.mark}
learned with the member states and [encourage capitals to integrate the
best practices]{.mark} into capabilities, policy, and implementation
planning. [NATO can also play an essential role in improving
communications and information sharing]{.mark} between the private and
the public sectors. [More can be done at the NATO level to identify what
kind of information between governments and companies can]{.mark} or
cannot [be shared, to develop standardized methods]{.mark} and formats
for information sharing, [and to encourage the use of automated platform
capabilities]{.mark} to share this information quickly]{.underline}.

### Solvency: Resilience---NATO Information Sharing

#### Information sharing is necessary---strong members need to work with weaker ones

Even though the cyber security is a part of NATO's collective defense,
there are some setbacks. According to Salih Bicakci, [there are three
main reasons of why NATO is still not sufficient on collective cyber
security]{.underline}. The [first]{.underline} reason is that the
[capacities of member states on cyber security are
different]{.underline}. The [second]{.underline} reason is that the
[threats on cyberspace frequently transform themselves, so adoption
process is not easy for everyone]{.underline}. The [third]{.underline}
reason is that [most of the threats come from the private
sector,]{.underline} so it is not easy to communicate with the all
private sectors in each member state.

According to Piret Pernik, [the [most important lack of NATO's cyber
security policy is the lack of sharing experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}.
He argues that [[more advanced member states, having heavily invested
into national cyber capabilities, hesitate sharing these with others for
financial and security reasons]{.underline}]{.mark} \[6\].

As the cyber security expert, Jarno Limnell, has noted, [the [central
barrier to greater cooperation]{.mark} and overall increased cyber
capability for NATO [has]{.mark} essentially [been a certain lack of
trust]{.mark}. [More powerful allies don't yet fully trust less capable
ones]{.mark} with information and knowledge about their abilities and
weaknesses and prefer to have bilateral or smaller-scale multilateral
cooperation in the cyber defense domain]{.underline} \[17\].

### Solvency: Resilience---NATO Partner Cooperation

#### Resilience is the best framework within which to bolster NATO's cyber capabilities---partnership actions are vital

[Without any doubt, [the best avenue is to
c]{.mark}ollectively]{.underline} battle cybercrime and to
collaboratively [[**reinforce** NATO's resilience to
cyber-attack]{.mark}s]{.underline}. It underscores that, [while NATO
conducts business in cyber defense area, [a continued emphasis on
involving other actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (organizations, Allies,
partner nations, private sectors) [[is essential. The cooperation with
different actors to learn to work together, share information and fully
grasp the rapid dynamics of cyber crises. It is critical for creating
bonds between specialists]{.mark} of different countries, [improving
interoperability and practicing the intricacies of preventing malicious
cyber threats. It in turn will build trust and strengthen bonds of NATO
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Prospective cooperation areas in cyber security are increasing
interoperability, sharing strategic and technical information and threat
assessments, coordinating responses to cyber crisis and engaging
partners into NATO's education, exercises and training
activities]{.underline}. In order to to help develop national expertise
NATO is helping member countries by sharing information and best
practices, and conducting cyber defense exercises[. Cyber defense is as
much about people as it is about technology.]{.underline}

#### Working with NATO partners is critical to bolstering NATO's defenses---collaboration is key

Evolution of NATO's Cyber Security Policy and Future Prospects," JOURNAL
OF DEFENSE REOURCES MANAGEMENT v. 10 n. 1 (18), 2019, p. 104-105\]

[The [ubiquity of cyber threats highlights the need to work
together]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a key issue when reviewing NATO's role.
It came to the fore as a result of the cyberattacks plotted against both
NATO and partner nations. The [[cooperation between like-minded states
and international organizations is the best way to address many cyber
risks. NATO has the capabilities to offer a clear platform for
exchanging practice between Allies and partners]{.underline}]{.mark}
through a more extensive variety means, including NATO's Defense
Planning Process.

[[Such mechanisms might include operational and technical support and
advice regarding cyberdefense capability development and
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}. It might entail advice on the
establishment of a cyber-security strategy or brokering the exchange of
lessons learned and situational awareness on cyber domain.

Even though the cyber-attacks are unlikely to be as lethal as strategic
bombs for the foreseeable future, [NATO has to brace itself for much
more complicated predicaments regarding cyber threats emanating from its
rivals. It will take a lot of effort and further bold decisions to move
closer towards achieving the goal on thwarting cyber threats before they
have important physical ramifications]{.underline}.

If virtual space becomes an inherent part of the NATO operations and
exercises it will help the Alliance to adapt to emerging technological
challenges. It in turn will necessitate to bridge the gap between
Allies. Together with its member states NATO has to facilitate partner
nations' cyber defense capability development and participation in the
annual trainings and exercises based on reciprocal interests, shared
values and common approaches. [[There is not any obstacle for partners
to cooperate at a technical level]{.underline}]{.mark}. NATO might
establish individually-tailored projects in accordance with interests
and capacities of partners to enhance their cyber security.

[[Only when the Allies and trusted partners collectively pursue a
cyber-policy, they will be able to successfully prepare themselves for
cyber threats to their national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even
though the cyber defense is a part of collective security, NATO still
lacks a stringent deterrence against cyberattacks. A stringent
deterrence means that a state should have an offensive capability if it
is attacked. Thus NATO has to prove that it is not only aware of the
gravity of the cyber threat but also ready to defend against it.

#### Cooperation is important to effective cyberdefenses

[[In cyber conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [terrestrial
distance]{.underline} between adversaries [[can be
irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark} because everyone is a next-door
neighbour in cyberspace. And of course [[it necessitate cooperating
internationally]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Jamie Shea, NATO deputy
assistant secretary general for emerging security challenges mentioned:
[NATO has agreed a series of actions that can be taken in the form of
assistance to allies]{.underline}, he said, [including training,
education, exercises, malware intelligence sharing, early warning, and
incident response. [The third key element of the enhanced NATO cyber
defense policy is multi-national cooperation in cyber defense, which
includes the concept of "smart defense" through pooling and sharing
capabilitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}. This means that all future NATO
military exercises will involve a cyber-component and look at the
challenges of running military operations in a degraded cyber operating
environment \[16\].

Project Resilience Forward

[[NATO members share a keen interest in the societal resilience of other
countries beyond]{.mark} the EU and [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
particularly in wider Europe, [[since strong efforts in one country may
mean little if neighboring countries, with which they share considerable
interdependencies, are weak]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russia's hybrid
efforts to subvert Ukrainian authority are but the latest examples of
this growing security challenge. [[Allies should be proactive about
sharing societal resilience strategies]{.mark}, not only with allies but
[with selected partners]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Through a strategy of "forward resilience]{.underline},"NATO
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and EU memberstates [[would
identif]{.underline}y]{.mark}---very publicly---[[their resiliency with
that of othe]{.mark}rs]{.underline} beyond the EU and NATO, [[and share
societal resilience approaches and operational procedures with
partners]{.mark} to improve societal resilience to corruption,
psychological, and information warfare, and intentional or natural
disruptions to cyber, financial, and energy networks and other critical
infrastructures,with a strong focus on prevention]{.underline} but also
response. [[Forward resilience would also enhance joint capacity to
defend against threats]{.mark} to interconnected domestic economies and
societies and resist Russian efforts to exploit weaknesses of these
societies to disrupt and keep them under its influence.]{.underline}

The EU and its memberstates, and NATO and its [[allies, should
facilitate joint or complementary efforts to project "forward
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}" toE U Eastern Partnership or NATO
Partnership countries in areas such as security sector reform, police
and gendarmerie training, public health-biosecurity measures, civilian
control of the military, or economic reconstruction. In thisregard,the
EU and its memberstates, and NATO and its allies,should consider
deploying coordinated Forward Resilience Support Teams, at the
invitation ofEU Eastern Partnership or NATO Partnership countries, to
support building resilient capacity in areas ranging from critical
infrastructure protection and strategic communications,to disaster
prevention, management, and relief, to civil-military cooperation.

#### NATO should step up its resilience capabilities---can play an important support role

INTERCONNECTED WORLD, 2016, p. 40-41\]

NATO's Role

[While [resilienc]{.mark}e requires a broad approach with significant
civilian political and economic aspects, it also [has major military
components. NATO military]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[forces]{.underline}]{.mark}, even in small number, [[can be effective
to back up local]{.underline}]{.mark} border
[[forces]{.underline}]{.mark} or special operations forces [[to detect
and neutralize foreign insurgents]{.underline}]{.mark}. National forces
should be primary, in keeping with Article 3 of the Washington Treaty.
But NATO [[allies can assist where requested]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [for protection of key industrial, commercial, and
transportation nodes]{.underline} (especially those intended for use in
reception of reinforcements), [counter insurgency operations and
para-military police functions,responses to civil emergencies and covert
operations, and crisis response management.]{.underline}

[[NATO and its members already possess noteworthy capabilitie sin these
areas, but their ability to act as a fully organized, capable alliance
is not well-developed. NATO will need improved physical assets,
strengthened strategic planning and operating
capacities]{.underline}]{.mark}. It will need to coordinate closely with
national governments, many of which view control of societal security
resources as vital manifestations of their sovereignty, and have diverse
constitutional approaches to domestic uses of their military and to
civil-military cooperation in crisis situations.

Moreover,[NATO engagement in this area will require a fundamentally
different relationship with the EU, which]{.underline} has undertaken a
range of activities and initiatives aimed at improving its military and
civilian capabilities and structures to respond to crises spanning both
societal defense and societalsecurity,including cross-border cooperation
on consequence management after natural and manmade disasters.

In short, [[resilience is a job for NATO, but it is not a job for NATO
alone. In many instances it may require national or EU
authorities]{.underline}]{.mark} to play a lead role. The issue for NATO
is not just what it should do, but how it fits within an array of
necessary Western efforts to bolster transatlantic resilience. In such
instances, [[NATO may play a support role. Hybrid challenges]{.mark},
for instance, [may include but are not limited to military elements and
must be addressed in more comprehensive ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. 4

[[To further enhance its assistance to partner countries NATO should
identify]{.mark}, via cooperation with the research community and
recipient countries, [individual cyber defense needs in the areas of
material and nonmaterial resources, knowledge, expertise, and
information sharing]{.mark}. The [first area where NATO should
consolidate more efforts is increasing interoperability of partners'
cyber defense capabilities, communication and information systems and
networks, as well asinformation and threat assessment exchange

[[Sensitivity related to offensive cyber capabilities and fear of
disclosing one's own vulnerabilities have been obstacles in fostering
trust]{.underline}]{.mark} that is fundamental for cooperation, and
especially information and intelligence sharing[. [NATO should work
closely with partners to expand mutual information and threat assessment
sharing, a critical aspect of defending against hybrid and cyber
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO and EU agreed at the Warsaw Summit to
share information and---to the extent possible---intelligence between
staffs, cooperate on strategic communication, and expand existing
cooperation on cyber security and defense, including operations,
exercises and training.The EU has a wide toolbox ofstrategies, policies,
procedures and technical measures to support non-military aspects of
cyber security in member states and partner countries.

More Tools to Coordinate National Efforts

[The core of NATO cybersecurity efforts lie at the member-state level.
NATO is responsible for protecting its own]{.underline} institutional
information and communication [systems]{.underline}, but it has little
say in coordinating how member states develop their national cyber
defense capabilities. Despite having signed the Cyber Defense Pledge at
the Warsaw NATO Summit, [[many member states still struggle to implement
and evaluate their national cyber-security plans. As a result NATO's
efforts at developing uniform, alliance-wide cybersecurity are
undermined]{.mark} by significant inconsistencies]{.underline} across
the national level of the member states and NATO's collective security
and deterrence in cyberspace still show serious vulnerabilities against
the backdrop of a growing number of attacks.

[[For NATO to operationalize cyberspace]{.mark} as a domain of NATO
defense policy and planning]{.underline} --- as was agreed at the NATO
Warsaw Summit --- the [[Alliance should have authorizations from member
states to do more than just provide advice, expertise, training, or
education]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similar to how NATO coordinates Allied
military forces in the conventional domain, [[NATO could also be asked
to evaluate how member states can develop, synergize, and complement
their mutual national cyber defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline} At a minimum,
[[NATO should develop standards]{.mark} and better indicators that allow
a standardized measurement of a nation's annual progress]{.underline}
--- and should be tasked with testing and measuring members'
capabilities annually. To achieve this objective, a strong cooperation
with the European Union is essential. NATO and the EU could work
together to design minimum cybersecurity requirements and benchmarks
that would also be adopted by the European Defense Agency.

Third, [[Nato needs to get better at combating less traditional security
challenges]{.mark}. This pandemic is one of many diverse
threats]{.underline} to national security, [from terrorism and cyber
attacks to disinformation campaigns]{.underline} and the effects of
climate change.

[None can be deterred by tanks and missiles]{.underline}. In fact, the
[b[est defence is to strengthen our ability to absorb such blows]{.mark}
and continue to tackle their causes. [That means we must improve our
resilience]{.mark} --- for example by strengthening and adjusting our
critical infrastructure, be that energy grids, roads and railways, or
computer networks and healthcare systems.]{.underline} While this is
primarily a task for national governments, [[Nato should play a strong
supporting role, building resilience into its own structures, forces and
operations and adding military and organisational expertise to national
efforts]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nato has been working on all this --- from the Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence in Estonia, to the management of emergency relief through the
Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination Centre.

["[Resilience" should become the alliance's watchword, high on its list
of priorities. To build such resilience, Nato needs to engage more
regularly and systematically with civilian organisations]{.mark}, from
police forces to disaster relief agencies, to experts in medicine,
climate and cyber security.]{.underline}

The alliance has just established a reflection group,chaired by American
and German leaders. I am confident that this group will aid Nato's
strategic development, developing fresh ideas on how to achieve greater
security for all transatlantic allies.

My country is doing its share --- in cash, capabilities, and
commitments, with another significant increase in 2020. After all, West
Germany joined Nato 65 years ago last week. Accession to the alliance
meant the return to western civilisation, a mere 10 years after the end
of the second world war. It allowed for German reunification and a
united Europe a few decades later.

Today, Nato continues to keep our homeland safe, projects stability and
provides immediate relief from unforeseen disasters such as this
pandemic. Building on this proud tradition of safeguarding freedom and
security for all states, the 30 sovereign members must take the next
step in creating a more resilient alliance.

Recommendations

• The [[Alliance should develop]{.mark} and continuously maintain [a
comprehensive picture of]{.mark} the v[ulnerabilities]{.mark} of allies
and partners [to 'hybrid warfare']{.mark}]{.underline} scenarios [[and
tailor its resilience-building assistance measures to the needs of
particular nations]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, it should remain
cognisant that national resilience is the responsibility of the national
governments.

• The [[Alliance should establish a comprehensive system of national
resilience indicators]{.underline}]{.mark} (ResilienceMonitor/Index),
[covering all relevant domains,to monitor and assess the overall state
of resilience in individual nations.This would provide a basis for more
focused and specific measures]{.underline}---at the national and NATO
levels---to address the short, medium and long-term needs.

• Although [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} is paying most attention to
infrastructure,networks and civil preparedness, it
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[include societal resilience into
its monitoring, assessment and support measures]{.mark}.[This is
particularly important from the perspective of maintaining the
Alliance's credibility, cohesion, unity and public support to its
mission]{.mark}.]{.underline}

• Much more effort has to be dedicated by NATO and the EU to studying
and understanding what deters Moscow, how it assesses vulnerabilities of
target countries and how it seeks to exploit those vulnerabilities to
its strategic ends. This has to be linked with early warning and
strategic anticipation efforts.

• [[NATO should establish individually-tailored projects and expand
existing projects in accordance with interests and capacities of
partners]{.mark} to enhance their cyber security and
defense]{.underline}. Prospective cooperation areas in cyber defense
include increasing interoperability, sharing strategic and technical
information and threat assessments, coordinating responses to cyber
crisis, and engaging partners into NATO's education, exercises and
training activities.

• [[NATO should consider establishing special cyber support
teams]{.mark} that can be deployed to partner countries with the aim to
increase interoperability, improve information sharing and coordinate
crisis response]{.underline}.

• [To support NATO Allies' resilience in]{.underline} the
[cyber]{.underline} security context cyber [experts should be included
into NATO Force Integration Units]{.underline} (NFIU). This would help
assess vulnerabilities, increase preparedness and interoperability in
regards with crisis response.

• To support projecting resilience in NATO partner nations NATO and the
EU should first assess the levels of the existing maturity of cyber
security and defense capacity in the target countries. They should
coordinate and synchronize mutual training and assistance projectsin
orderto avoid overlapping.Partnership Review and Planning Process (PARP)
should include as part of broader resilience also cyber defense
elements, and planning should to be aligned with the NATO Defense
Planning Process (NDPP).

• Partners would benefit from the development of minimal
requirementsforthe protection oftheir critical infrastructure and in
regards with cyber defense.

• [NATO allies should develop a clear political guidance concerning
which activities will be open for different partners, taking into
consideration willingness of an individual partner to cooperate with the
Alliance, as well as their maturity level]{.underline}. Some partners
should be engaged into partnerships with industry and into various
NATO's education and training efforts (cyber defense courses, cyber
ranges, cyber hygiene platforms, etc.). Some parters should be engaged
in planning phases of crisis management and cyber defense exercises.
Engagement in these activities and in the Federated Mission Networking
should be widened beyond the current range of seven partners.

• While common funding of partnership activities and the establishment
of trust remains challenging along with management difficulties of
common endeavors, [[NATO could facilitate a lead/framework nation
approach that would contribute to the setting up of specific trustfunds
and tailored training projects]{.mark} .A lead nation could promote
specific projects,task and working groups where other nations could plug
in]{.underline}.

• In addition to providing technical cyber defense training, consulting
partner nations on how to develop their national cyber security and
defense programmes, policies and strategies would contribute to the
development of common terminology and increase partners' understanding
of cyber threats, as well as promote adherence to fundamental democratic
values in cyberspace activities.

At the July 2016 Warsaw Summit, [NATO allies agreed to set resilience
standards]{.underline} and each made a pledge to bolster its own
national resilience under Article 3 of the North Atlantic Treaty,
according to which allies commit to "maintain and develop their
individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.'' This is an
important step. [But [**more** will need to be]{.mark}
done]{.underline}.

[[Make resilience an integral element of NATO's core
tasks]{.mark},]{.underline} or consider making resilience a fourth core
task. [A key element of Russia's strategy isthe use ofstrategic surprise
and hybrid threatsto take advantage of weak states. Extremist
threats]{.underline} from the south [also challenge]{.underline} the
fabric of [Western societies. Greater societal and defense [resilience
can be an important component of an effective response]{.mark}. Creating
a higher degree of resilience]{.underline} in vulnerable societies
[makes it more difficult for state or non-state actors alike to disrupt
and create the instability they need for their success. Societies deemed
indefensible in traditional defense terms can be rendered indigestible
through resilience[. Resilience has become integral to each of NATO's
current core tasks]{.mark} of collective defense]{.underline},
cooperative security, and crisis management.Initial [[activities could
include]{.mark} the following]{.underline}:

• [[Develop civil-military Resilience Support
Teams]{.underline}]{.mark}, small operational unitsthat could
offersupport to NATO member national authorities in such areas of
emergency preparedness including assessments; intelligence
sharing,support and analysis; border control; assistance to police and
military in incident management including containing riots and other
domestic disturbances; helping effectuate cross-border arrangements with
other NATO members; providing protection for key critical
infrastructures including energy; and, in the cyber arena,support and
enhancement of NATO's Cyber Response Team. NATO is moving forward with
such Advisory Support Teams. It should consider that these NATO teams
could work in parallel with similar EU groups using the same playbook.
In certain countries, Resilience Support Teams could be collocated with
NATO Force Integration Units, and help national responses with NATO
military activities including especially special operations activities.

• [[Create "National Resilience Working Groups]{.mark}."]{.underline}
Encourage relevant nations to establish working group-type secretariats
to coordinate defense activities with overlapping civil authority and
private sector key critical infrastructure functions to enhance national
capacity to anticipate, prevent, respond and recover from disruptive
scenarios and to provide a key point of contact for outside
assistance,including NATO Resilience Support Teams in the east, focused
on the development of resilience and response to hybrid threats; in the
south, focused on resilience and humanitarian requirements; and
throughout the Alliance, focused on cyber and particularly its support
to the electric grid and finance. Such a group should also have
continuous situational awareness of a state's hybrid risk assessment.
Coordina tion,integration, and exercises at the national level will make
outside support from NATO and other organizations most useful.

• [[Encourage the establishment of regional working
groups]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition to national working groups,
concerned nations could establish working groups with overlapping
issues---one approach would be to look to the nations in the framework
arrangements for the east and for the south---with invitations later for
others to join as they deem desirable. This would be somewhat similar to
such regional mechanisms as Nordic Defense Cooperation (NORDEFCO) or the
Southeast European Defense Ministerial.

• [[Include resilience events in NATO exercises]{.underline}]{.mark},
training, education and operational planning. Resilience events should
be included especially in NATO Crisis ManagementExercises(CMX) and cyber
exercises such as the annual cyber coalition exercises.

Bolster coordination with the private sector. [[Effective resilience
requires engagement by the private sector]{.underline}]{.mark},which
owns mostinfrastructures critical to essentialsocietal functions.A good
firststep would be to develop mechanisms to coordinate with private
institutions and entities on key security issues focused on the
development of resilience, with cyber as the initial arena.

Enhance counterterrorism cooperation. Counterterrorism within the NATO
region remains primarily the responsibility of national
intelligence,interior, and police authorities.NATO's counterterrorism
activities since 2001 have consisted primarily of safeguarding allied
airspace and maritime approaches and intelligence sharing,i.e.,guarding
the approaches to NATO territory. NATO should consider options for
expanding intelligence sharing and its capabilities to support the
protection of critical infrastructure, especially infrastructure
essential to the performance of NATO core tasks. This should include the
development of procedures and plans to ensure the prompt deployment of
special operations forces--- useful in disrupting some kinds of
terrorist attacks---if national authorities ask NATO for this type of
assistance. NATO should apply its plans for securing pipelines, offshore
oil platforms, and ports to insure energy suppliesin wartime to the
challenge of anti-terrorist protection ofsuch critical infrastructure.

Develop a more robust strategic communications strategy to address
Russia'sinformation operations, particularly where Moscow seeks to
exploit social and political differences in allied states, including
those with sizable ethnic Russian or Russian-speaking populations.

touch all aspects of life and present exciting opportunities for the
alliance, they also [[present threats. Many of NATO's adversaries use
EDTs]{.underline}]{.mark} against alliance personnel and infrastructure,
such as recent cyberattacks targeting Polish politicians and the
Colonial Pipeline. [[Enhancing its innovation processes will allow NATO
to improve]{.mark} its military [technology]{.mark} across all domains
[and boost its deterrence and defense capabilities. NATO could then
better deter Russian and Chinese hybrid threa]{.mark}ts]{.underline} in
cyber, space, electronic warfare, and information domains. For instance,
[[NATO can use its]{.mark} forthcoming [Cyber Command to take collective

unified]{.mark} offensive cyber or conventional [responses]{.mark} if
crossed by its adversaries. By [strengthening its cyber abilities and
adding new capabilities, NATO can deter adversaries]{.mark} in the

Rapid Assessment and Decision-Making Tools

[The [scale, speed, and intensity of today's cyber-attacks demand a new
approach]{.mark} to respond]{.underline} at the political, military, and
civilian level. [[To develop a rapid decision-making process]{.mark}
when facing a cyber-attack [NATO can take]{.mark} a few [effective
measures across its organization]{.mark}. First, [more resources must be
allocated to accurately and quickly detect an]{.mark}d define hostile
[cyber actions]{.mark}.]{.underline} Further work on indications,
warnings, and situational awareness is critical. In this context,
[[NATO's]{.mark} various [civil and military intelligence
units]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} inter alia, [[could have a useful
role.]{.underline}]{.mark} In addition, the Supreme Allied Commander
Europe ([[SACEUR) could be granted more powers]{.underline}]{.mark} by
the North Atlantic Council [[in authorizing]{.mark} some of the
[preparatory procedures]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the same time, [[NATO
headquarters should increase the number of exercises that test rapid
decisions-making procedures]{.mark} in complex and demanding cyber
crisis-conflict scenarios]{.underline}.

[Much can also be done at the member-state level. A[llies]{.mark} and
willing partners [should continue to work on improving and updating
threat assessments, and facilitating closer intelligence
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this light, [[Allies should
identify information sharing as a clear requirement]{.mark} and
task.]{.underline}

NATO could also intensify its interaction with national intelligence
services and establish supply chain management partnerships with
national industries. Cyber threats come in the form of networks and it
takes a similarly well-organized network of international and
cross-sector cooperation to defeat those threats.

### Solvency: Resilience---NDPP / Consultation

#### \[x\] There is capital for resilience improvements now---should focus on resilience within the context of deterrence (by denial) through consultative policies

Policy Recommendations

[[NATO could resolve the tension between its collective responsibility
for resilience and the continuing]{.mark} [national responsibility among
member states for implementing resilience measures by addressing
resilience in the framework of deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} and
defence.

This aligns with the concept of deterrence used in the 2019 NATO
Military Strategy and the 2020 Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of
the Euro-Atlantic Area, which focuses less on crisis response and more
on how deterrence can be used in persistent competition.33 [The growing
use of hostile measures short of war]{.underline}---which prompted the
search for more sustained and wider resilience after 2014---[has
increased the importance of deterrence by denial]{.underline}.

[[Considering resilience within the context of deterrence will establish
the overarching logic of NATO's engagement with resilience issues and
encourage the practicalities of moving towards "collective
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}". [As a form of deterrence, [resilience
policies will need to meet the three key criteria of all forms of
deterrence: commitment, capability and
communication]{.mark}]{.underline}.34

[[Commitment to strengthening resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, already
significantly enhanced among member states after the Russian invasion of
Crimea, [[will be greatly strengthened by the war in Ukraine. It will be
important for NATO and its members to take advantage of the political
capital created by these developments]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
COVID-19 pandemic [in [enacting costly resilience measures.]{.mark} NATO
should therefore focus on four aspects of resilience]{.underline} rather
than the broader seven baseline requirements. [These are: continuity in
energy and essential supplies; the security of the digital
realm]{.underline} to ensure key socioeconomic functions; [maintaining
the independence of critical technologies beyond the control of
adversaries; and the ability to detect and dispel
disinformation.]{.underline}

In terms of capability, [[NATO should adopt a practical approach to
helping the process of strengthening alliancewide
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than trying to "establish,
assess, review and monitor broad resilience objectives to guide
nationally-developed resilience goals", NATO should start the other way
round. [A [similar approach to the NDPP, which]{.mark} consults with
allies about their military plans, [could be taken to encourage the
harmonisation of member state and NATO objectives concerning
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[The NDPP identifies shortfalls in NATO capabilities before setting,
assisting and reviewing the efforts of individual members to achieve
country-specific targets]{.underline}]{.mark} aimed at resolving
weaknesses and strengthening NATO's defensive posture.35 As a process
tailored for each member, "capability targets" are produced for each
member according to the "political principles of fair burden-sharing".36
Though this expectedly produces political tensions surrounding the issue
of what is "fair", it represents a more nuanced and realistic approach
than the adoption of organisation-wide requirements. As argued above,
[[it would]{.mark} still [be advisable for NATO to set]{.mark}
relatively few, [clearly understandable goals]{.mark} that allow for the
positive effects of peer competition]{.underline}, much like the success
of the Defence Investment Pledge of 2014 in which members committed to
spend at least 2 percent of Gross Domestic Product on defence and 20
percent of defence spending on major new equipment within a decade.37
Resisting the temptation to set numerous goals also helps bring clarity
and focus to avoid potential gaps between rhetorical commitments and
policy fulfilment.

Lastly, [[communication]{.mark} with both internal and external
audiences [will be essential to fostering resilience]{.mark} within
NATO]{.underline}. The ability to demonstrate resilience to external
audiences can serve as an effective deterrent against aggressive action.
As with NATO's annual military deterrence exercise,38 comprehensive
preparation and regular exercises can play an important role in
resilience measures by enhancing deterrence by denial. Exercises can get
messages across to allies and domestic audiences.39 Societal and
psychological resilience is also an essential complement to developing
physical resilience capabilities. This was exemplified in 2018 by NATO
partner Sweden's delivery of a brochure to every household titled "If
War or Crisis Comes", which offered advice on what to do in events of
power shortages or loss of internet access.40 The leaflet stated that
"everyone who lives in Sweden shares a collective responsibility for our
country's security and safety".41

[[One avenue for building societal resilience that could be explored by
NATO members is working with creative industries]{.mark} to put across
the need---and help create a narrative---for preparation for crisis
events]{.underline}. Following precedents from the Cold War, in 2019 the
French military employed science fiction writers to assist in
conceptualising potential threats to national security.42 The same logic
could be applied to getting the public to think about unfamiliar
scenarios that may emerge in the contemporary and future security
environment.

#### Best way to improve resilience is to house it in deterrence logics and work through NDPP-style consultative processes

**Hall & Sandeman, London School of Economics researchers, '22**

\[Jonny Hall, PhD Candidate, International Relations, London School of
Economics and Political Science and Hugh Sandeman, Visiting Senior
Fellow, LSE Ideas and Project Head of Global Strategies, "NATO's
Resilience: The First and Last Line of Defence," Strategic Update, LSE

[This]{.underline} Strategic [Update makes two proposals towards
ensuring that attempts to strengthen resilience within NATO deliver
practical]{.underline} results.

[First, [locating the effort to improve resilience firmly in the context
of NATO's new approach to deterrence can resolve the tension between
long-established requirements for resilience]{.mark} in meeting armed
attack [and]{.mark} the newer, [broader requirements for resilience
against hostile acts below the threshold of]{.mark} war. This should
help to maintain the focus on reducing vulnerabilities and threats to
security, ensuring that NATO's forces can operate effectively in varying
states of peace, crisis and conflict.]{.underline}

[Second, [by adopting and improving a consultative approach to
resilience that is similar to the NATO Defence Planning
Process]{.mark}]{.underline} (NDPP), [[NATO can avoid applying a
bureaucratic]{.mark} and probably unproductive c[hecklist]{.mark} for
evaluating progress in the national resilience of member states. [This
would involve agreeing what each state individually should set as its
resilience priorities, with the collective resilience of the whole
alliance as a parallel objective.]{.mark}]{.underline}

These recommendations are reached in three steps: answering the question
of what resilience is; analysing NATO's evolving role in issues of
national resilience among its members; and outlining the political
challenge of setting and meeting resilience objectives.

### Solvency: Resilience---Strategic Concept Incorporation

#### Resilience needs to be a focus of the new Strategic Concept

accessed 5-22-22\]

Second, [[the alliance needs to continue its efforts to strengthen its
capabilities in]{.underline}]{.mark} two distinct areas: conventional
military might and [[resilience against]{.mark} so-called
[hybrid]{.mark} or non-kinetic [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, [NATO nations have begun
to focus again on a major power competitor]{.underline}. Four NATO
battlegroups are forward-deployed to the Baltic states and Poland. A
small, very high-readiness force and a larger readiness initiative were
undertaken to back up those battalions. A mobilization initiative was
designed to make sure ready forces can forward-deploy quickly. But
European defense budgets constrained by COVID-19 will put those
initiatives in jeopardy. The Strategic Concept will need to prioritize
those programs.

[The alliance must also more methodically address unconventional
challenges to human security from Russia such as media disinformation,
corrosive cyber operations, supply chain disruptions and energy
intimidation. [The Strategic Concept needs to design resilience programs
so that alliance members can better protect the critical functions of
our societies to such disruptive dangers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Solvency: Resilience---U.S. Support / Push

President-elect [[Biden]{.mark} and his team have pledged to renew US
leadership in cooperation with Allies]{.underline} and partners. [That
agenda [should start at NATO, and a key focus should be on
cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}. In early NATO meetings, the
[Biden]{.underline} administration [should champion a cybersecurity
continuous-response campaign]{.underline}, built around three key
actions.

[First, [NATO should require the development and implementation of
resilient cybersecurity architectures for itself, its members' forces,
and its key critical infrastructures.]{.mark} A resilient cybersecurity
architecture involves an integrated set of capabilities that work as a
system to reduce the disruptive effects of cyber
adversaries.]{.underline} Key elements of a resilient architecture
should include use of private sector cloud technology; zero-trust
architecture for effective access management; development of secure
hardware capabilities; and machine-learning and
artificial-intelligence-augmented cyber defenses. This architecture also
needs to be flexible to incorporate emerging technologies as they are
developed.

[[NATO]{.mark} itself cannot develop such architectures. It
[can]{.mark}, however, [underscore their necessity and require its
members to do so, using the]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO Defense Planning
Process ([[NDPP), acquisition procedures, standards and targets, and
innovation from Allied Command Transformation to support a comprehensive
research and development effort]{.underline}.]{.mark} In establishing
requirements for these resilient architectures, NATO must recognize that
one size will not fit all. Not only will requirements differ among
military, government, and critical infrastructures operators, but, as
has been shown in the development of autonomous vehicles and space
capabilities, there are a variety of different approaches that may prove
effective. In fact, [[having diversity within these capabilities will
increase resilience by complicating adversaries' abilities to infiltrate
and attack them]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Solvency: Resilience---S: A2 "Attribution"

#### Attribution is getting easier and anonymous attacks are ineffective

**Davis, STC General Rapporteur, '19**

\[Susan Davis, General Rapporteur, STC, "NATO in the Cyber Age:
Strengthening Secuirty & Defence, Stabilising Deterrence," Science and
Technology Committee (STC), NATO Parlilamentary Assembly, 8---13---19,
p. 3\]

15\. However, [in recent years, [governments, private companies, and
research organisations have increased their ability to attribute
attacks]{.mark} at higher levels of confidence. [Forensic tools have
improved, and private and state analysts have built up databases and
characteristic patterns]{.mark} for known intruders.]{.underline} On a
technical level, [truly harmful cyber attacks are very complicated and
involve many moving pieces. Thus, [the more complicated the cyber
attack, the more likely that the attacker will commit mistakes along the
way, enabling a forensics expert to trace the origin]{.mark} of the
attack]{.underline} (Lindsay, 2015). Indeed, [governments]{.underline}
within the Alliance and beyond [are increasingly attributing malicious
cyber incidents to states and their proxies]{.underline}. Such
transparency on cyber incidents is increasingly collective, coordinated
in policy and time, and independent of the scale, nature, or impact of
the incident (Giles and Hartmann, 2019). The Rapporteur supports this
emerging policy of naming and shaming perpetrators and encourages
further conversations at the NATO level.

16\. [Even if states and their proxies could be confident they will
remain anonymous, truly convincing strategic rationales for large-scale
surprise attacks are lacking. [Anonymous cyber attacks are not
well-suited for coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example. Coercion
only works if the attacked knows whom to yield or make concessions to.
As one analyst points out succinctly, "\[p\]urely anonymous coercion is
almost impossible because communicating and understanding the power to
hurt implies that there is someone doing the hurting and a target
concerned about avoiding getting hurt" (Lindsay, 2015). As a result, if
an opponent wishes to coerce through cyber attacks, he cannot hide
himself. This would defeat the purpose. How can the victim give in to
demands if he does not know who the attacker is? (In contrast, cyber
criminals want to stay anonymous when they, for example, attempt to
extort money from victims.)

#### Cooperation bolsters attribution abilities

[Thirdly, [NATO's particular advantage in cyber defence could stem from
cooperation with its partner countries]{.mark} and with other
international organisations]{.underline}, especially the European Union.
Neither the Alliance nor the Union is an island on its own when it comes
to cyber threats and vulnerabilities. [The EU can do a lot in areas that
are relevant for NATO,]{.underline} such as cybersecurity certification
of devices imported into and used in European markets. Dependence on
non-EU and non-NATO software could become a critical national security
concern, as illustrated by for instance the Kaspersky case in the US.24
[[As highlighted by the recent attributions, there could be a global
will for cooperation between NATO and non-NATO countries as any of them
could become a target, as well as a bridgehead for further spreads of
malicious cyber activitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}, as demonstrated by the
WannaCry and NotPetya attacks.

## Solvency: Multi-Prong / Author Proposals

[The [last several years have seen calls for NATO to **embrace**]{.mark}
strategic [**resilience**,]{.mark} and]{.underline} the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 pandemic [has]{.underline} both [amplified
and accelerated debates surrounding resilience]{.underline}. One
recommendation that has emerged is that [[NATO should adopt
"comprehensive resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}" as a fourth core task
alongside the three existing tasks of collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security laid out in the 2010 Strategic
Concept. [Resilience has generally referred to the ability to
"anticipate, prevent, and...protect against and bounce forward from
disruptions to restore critical functions]{.underline}."1 [Comprehensive
[resilience is thus meant to address a range of challenges facing the
Alliance]{.mark} and is necessarily a shared endeavor that can be
projected forward outside the membership bounds of NATO]{.underline}.2
This chapter addresses one dimension of comprehensive resilience by
highlighting the Alliance's cybersecurity challenges and the strategic
necessity of resilience in the cyber domain.

The [COVID]{.underline}-19 pandemic [has highlighted that cybersecurity
encompasses more than "cyber war]{.underline}"3 [by underscoring the
reliance of nations and their economies on cyberspace and digital
infrastructures]{.underline}. Massive [migrations to online services
have occurred with]{.underline} the transition to remote telework and
education, among other [vital societal activities. NATO itself has been
no exception,]{.underline} as the Alliance worked to facilitate remote
work by shipping critical communication and information systems items to
NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) support teams across
various countries. This effort included simultaneously shipping laptops
from its Headquarters in Belgium to Allied Command Transformation (ACT)
in Virginia, United States and shuttling devices across European borders
to Mons, Belgium to ensure business continuity for Allied Command
Operations (ACO).4 [Pandemic-induced shifts into business and
operational continuity plans have thus brought to the forefront security
issues like threats to digital supply chains]{.underline}, which have
become even more salient in the wake of the SolarWinds hack.5 Recent
high[-profile ransomware attacks]{.underline} against US companies
Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods [have only intensified the need to
secure supply chains from digital threats]{.underline}.6

Concomitantly, broader [questions have arisen about NATO's strategic
approach to cyberspace]{.underline}. The most recent Strategic Concept,
released in the wake of the 2010 Lisbon Summit, provides few clues as to
how collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative security
relate to cyberspace. In fact, the document only mentions the word
"cyber" five times.7 [[An urgency to reconsider NATO's efforts in the
cyber domain has been evidenced]{.mark} by recommendations from the NATO
2030 Reflection Group]{.underline}, which devoted an entire sub-section
of its report to hybrid and cyber threats. In particular, [the
Reflection Group highlighted the need to develop both greater collective
defense capacity in cyberspace and a more robust consultation
framework]{.underline} to facilitate collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security in the domain.8 These concerns were
largely echoed by Allies in the recent 2021 Brussels Summit Communiqué.9

This chapter argues that [[for NATO to effectively address]{.mark} the
broad range of security [challenges]{.mark} emanating
[from]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} domain, [the
[Alliance must]{.mark} complement its current collective defense efforts
by **[incorporat]{.mark}**ing [resilience and "safe-to-fail"
principles]{.mark}]{.underline} into a new Strategic Concept. [The
unique dynamics of cyberspace mean that [resilience must be]{.mark} [a
shared effort among members, and]{.mark} it must be [projected outside
the Alliance's borders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This chapter]{.underline}
therefore [recommends that NATO adopt a fourth core task of
comprehensive resilience that includes shared and forward cyber
resilience as a major component.]{.underline} While NATO has thus far
prioritized the operationalization of collective defense in cyberspace[,
the strategic logics that underpin collective defense will not apply to
the full spectrum of threats presented by the domain.]{.underline} [Part
of the challenge]{.underline}, then, [is to reframe the Alliance's cyber
security conversations to acknowledge the limits of collective
defense]{.underline}.

[NATO's ongoing efforts to operationalize collective defense have relied
primarily on 'fail-deadly' and 'fail-safe' logics]{.underline}. On the
one hand, the Alliance has drawn on deterrence principles in attempts to
discourage and prevent adversarial actions in and through cyberspace
through the imposition of costs that would outweigh potential gains.10
[While denial strategies are vital to cost imposition,
deterrence-by-punishment has been the strategic bedrock of NATO's recent
initiatives]{.underline}. [The threat of retaliatory punishment is
traditionally a 'fail-deadly' strategy]{.underline}: should an adversary
undertake an undesired action, i.e., deterrence fails, the Alliance
responds with the use of deadly force. On the other hand, [NATO has also
focused on implementing defensive measures to minimize the damage and
fallout from an attack in or through cyberspace]{.underline}. Such a
'fail-safe' strategy seeks to ensure that, should deterrence fail, the
Alliance and its members retain the ability (albeit degraded) to operate
safely and securely in the cyber domain.

[Combined, fail-[deadly and fail-safe strategies look to prevent and
mitigate of the costs of adversarial actions in the cyber
domain]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [In contrast,
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark} in cyberspace---[the ability to
anticipate, withstand, recover from, and adapt to strategic shocks or
surprises occurring in or through the cyber
domain]{.underline}11---[[emphasizes passive protection,
risk-minimization, and forward-looking continuity-of-operations
efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}.12 Unlike NATO's current approach to
collective defense, [[resilience rests on 'safe-to-fail'
principles]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a 'safe-to-fail strategy,'
[resilience is built on the assumption that, despite deterrent and
defensive measures, [the Alliance may fail to foresee adverse strategic
disruptions]{.mark}]{.underline} that remove the ability to operate and
coordinate in the cyber domain. [To withstand and bounce forward from
such disruptions, [NATO must ensure that military cyber functions and
capabilities fail safely]{.mark}---that is, to fail in ways that do not
remove the ability to recover at or above original operating capacity.
[Resilienc]{.mark}e thus [offers a way for the Alliance to account for a
variety of threats and scenarios to which fail-deadly and fail-safe
strategies prove ineffective]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time,
[[resilience serves to enhance collective defense in the cyber domain:
collective defense is more credible if the Alliance is more
resilient]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This chapter proceeds in the following sections. The first describes the
cyber threats facing the Alliance. The second section outlines NATO's
policy and organizational developments related to cyberspace. The third
section discusses the limitations of collective defense; in short,
collective defense efforts are best suited for countering the small
subset of cyber incidents that reach damage levels analogous to
conventional uses of force. The fifth section explores what cyber
resilience looks like for NATO and why it must be a shared phenomenon
that is projected forward outside the Alliance. The chapter concludes
with several recommendations for the Alliance as it looks ahead to 2030
and beyond.

### Solvency: Resilience---Hamilton '16 Recommendations

#### NATO needs to improve resilience to address cyber threats---including a NCOCC, enabling SACEUR to support member cyber capabilities, mutural cyber pledges, enhancing NCIRC, expanding training, and increasing support for CCDCE

The Cyber Dimension

[[The responsibility to]{.mark} deter, detect, defend against, and
[defeat a cyber attack rests primarily with nations]{.mark} and their
private sectors. [But the severe impact]{.mark} a cyber attack can have
on a nation's]{.underline} critical information [infrastructure, and its
use in recent military operations and intimidation campaigns, [has
implications for Alliance security]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[NATO and the defense establishments of its members are under constant
attack]{.mark} from]{.underline} cyber [hackers]{.underline} seeking to
penetrate their information systems, extract data, and plant viruses
that could be eventually be used against allies. NATO officials have
deemed these attacks to be a tier 1 threat. Attacks are aimed against
NATO systems used to develop defense policies and plans, but also more
dangerously against operational cyber networks needed to execute
military missions.

[NATO has taken the threat of cyber attacks very seriously.It has
created a high level Cyber Defense Committee]{.underline} that reports
directly to the NAC, a working level NATO Cyber Defense Management
Board, a NATO ComputerIncident Response Capability (NCIRC), a Cyber
Defense Center of Excellence in Tallinn, and more recently a NATO
Industry Cyber Partnership. The Wales Summit endorsed an Enhanced Cyber
Defense Policy which further strengthened NATO's efforts in this area.
Yet [[more must be done.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Recognize cyber as an operational domain and launch a voluntary NATO
Cyber Operations Coordination Center]{.underline}]{.mark} (NCOCC). The
NCOCC would report to Allied Command Operations and would be funded and
manned by participating members. Ideally the United States should take
the lead. Participating members should be those countries with cyber
operationsforces.The primary purposes ofthe NCOCC would be to share
information among the cyber operational forces of members,
conducttraining and education in conjunction with the Cooperative Cyber
Defense Center of Excellence (CCD COE), helpAllied Command Operations
and Allied Command Transformation plan cyber exercise events, and ensure
deployable cyber elements are forces listed with the Enhanced NRF and
VJTF.

In due course,if the NCOCC proves a success,it should transition into a
permanent NATO Cyber Operations Headquarters similar to the NATO SOF HQ.
Such a headquarters should generate the necessary arrangements and
readiness to allow nations to pool their capabilities and produce cyber
effects should there be a collective decision to do so. It should also
act to achieve consensus on issues of cyber deterrence, particularly
whetherindividualAlliance cyber defense capabilities alone are adequate,
or whether capabilities are needed to effectively deter major strikes
against NATO networks, the networks of individual nations, or against
the critical infrastructures of Allied nations---especially the
infrastructure identified as essential to NATO's core tasks. [[While
NATO's ability to acquire capabilities to respond to such attacks is not
a practical near-term consideration, individual Allies are already
taking on this mission and could do the same for the Alliance]{.mark} in
certain scenarios.]{.underline}

[• [Establish the means to allow SACEUR to plan for, integrate and
employ the contributions of members' cyber forces for defensive,
offensive and exploitative cyber operations]{.mark}.]{.underline}While
NATO is unlikely to agree to establishing offensive cyber capabilities
for the Alliance itself, individual Allies do possess these capabilities
and those capabilities may need to be coordinated in time of crisis or
conflict.

• [[Consider Mutual Cyber Standards Pledges]{.mark}. National networks
that connect to the NATO network can be weak, creating potential
vulnerabilities for the entire system. The Alliance might address this
problem via a "mutual cyber pledge]{.underline},'' grounded in an
Alliance-wide certification system, in which an individual Ally pledges
to meet agreed cyber defense standards and NATO itself pledges
assistance to those lacking capability to meet those standards, which is
then followed with a concrete work plan to achieve certification. NATO
at Warsaw took some important steps in this direction.

• [[Enhance NATO's Computer Incident Response
Capability]{.underline}]{.mark} (NCIRC) [[by rationalizing and
normalizing common funding, strengthening its Rapid Response
Teams]{.mark} in order to better assist members under attack who ask for
help, and [generating greater protection and resilience planning]{.mark}
for critical mobile networks,including capabilities development of
national cyber cells]{.underline} earmarked for NRF and VJTF.

• [[Task ACT to develop a Cyber OperationsTransformation Initiative to
explore opportunities for multinational training, networking,
information sharing and interoperability among the growing number of
NATO members fielding operational commands]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
model for this initiative should be the successful special operations
transformation initiative of the Riga summit.

• [[Increase support to NATO's Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence]{.underline}]{.mark} in Estonia, which should lead NATO to
draft a clear policy on responding to cyber attacks

#### NATO should expand support for internal cyber resilience initiativesand integrate resilience into partner programs

[NATO]{.underline}

[[Make resilience an integral element of NATO's core
tasks]{.underline}]{.mark}, or consider making resilience a fourth core
task. A key element of Russia's strategy is the use of strategic
surprise and hybrid threats to take advantage of vulnerable
societies.Extremist threats from the south also challenge the fabric of
Western societies. Greater societal and defense resilience can be an
important component of an effective response.Creating a higher degree
ofresilience in vulnerable societies makesit more difficult forstate or
nonstate actors alike to disrupt and create the instability they need
for their success. Societies deemed indefensible in traditional defense
terms can be rendered indigestible through resilience. Resilience has
become integral to each of NATo's core tasks of collective defense,
cooperative security, and crisis management, and forward resilience can
be an important element of NATo partnerships. Initial activities could
include the following: • Conduct a survey of resilience requirements.
NATo's newly adopted resilience guidelines provide an opportunity to
survey NATo members and partners to identify how countries believe they
measure up against these guidelines. The results can be used to guide
further support efforts.

• [[Set priorities. NATo analysts might create a matrix using country
vulnerability profiles and functional requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}
suggested in this book along with survey results [[to establish a list
of priority activities]{.underline}. For]{.mark} example, the matrix
might show that border control is the top priority in the Baltic states
but would be something differentin other nations. NATo might then use
the results of this matrix to identify immediate- and longer-term
resilience requirements. This effort could complement the recommended
survey.

• [[Identify those who can strengthen forward
resilience.]{.underline}]{.mark} NATo's Civil Emergency Planning
Committee has compiled a list of civilian experts who could be called
upon to support the enhancement of resilience. But given the magnitude
of the task, much greater efforts will be needed to identify others who
can strengthen and project resilience. No single organization or country
has the breadth and capability to deliver on all of these requirements
for enhancing resilience. This effort would include identifying those
international institutions, non-governmental organizations, nations, and
individuals that have a particular expertise in some element of
resilience. For example,NATo's Cyber Center ofExcellence and its
Computer Incident Response Capability are already helping countries with
their network security resilience, while oSCE and institutions such as
the U.S. National Endowment for Democracy or the European Endowment for
Democracy might be well suited to support societal resilience.

• [[Expand the functions of]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO's Civil Emergency
Planning Committee ([[CEPC]{.underline}]{.mark}). NATo's CEPC currently
has a mandate to plan for contingencies that involve civilian casualties
and to provide civilian expertise in the field of terrorism
preparedness, consequence management, disaster response, and protection
of critical infrastructure. If the expanded scope of resilience
requirements we suggest is accepted[, CEPC's responsibilities need to be
expanded and more resources will be required.]{.underline} There would
be a corresponding shift in its emphasis towards enhancement of national
resilience.

• [[Create Forward Resilience Advisory Support Teams]{.mark}. NATo has
periodically used Advisory Support Teams for civilian emergency planning
purposes.The resilience commitments made attheWarsaw Summit willrequire
a revitalization and expansion of theseAdvisory Support Teams in such
areas of emergency preparedness including assessments; intelligence
sharing, support and analysis; border control; assistance to police and
military in incident managementincluding containing riots and other
domestic disturbances; helping effectuate cross-border arrangements with
other NATo members]{.underline}; providing protection for key critical
infrastructuresincluding energy; and, in the cyber arena, support to and
enhancement of NATo's Cyber Response Team.Efforts to build these teams
should be accelerated. In certain countries, such Teams could be
collocated with NATo Force Integration Units, and help national
responses with NATo military activities including especially special
operations activities.

• [[Host nations could be encouraged to establish working grouptype
secretariats to coordinate defense activities with overlapping civil
authority and private sector key critical infrastructure func
tions]{.mark} to enhance national capacity]{.underline} to anticipate,
prevent, respond and recover from disruptive scenarios and to provide a
key point of contact for Forward Resilience Advisory Support Teams.

• [[Create "Partnership Programs" for Resilience]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This concept would be modeled on the current U.S. National Guard State
Partnership Program which now operates in 22 European countries and five
Middle Eastern countries. In the first instance, these U.S. National
Guard [programs might be expanded to focus more on resilience issues.But
more ambitiously[, national partnerships might be created on a framework
nation basisto connect NATo members and NATo
partners]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, Italy might serve as a
framework nation to develop a resilience partnership with a country in
NorthAfrica.Sweden might serve as a framework nation to develop a
resilience partnership with a country in eastern Europe. This concept
could help to decentralize the resilience-building effort and
significantly expand its scope, while also contributing to establishment
of specific trust funds and tailored training projects.

• [Develop clear political guidance concerning which activities will be
open for different partners, taking into consideration willingness of an
individual partner to cooperate with the Alliance, as well as their
maturity level]{.underline}. Some partners should be engaged into
partnerships with industry and into various NATo's education and
training efforts (cyber defense courses, cyber ranges, cyber hygiene
platforms, etc.). Some partners should be engaged in planning phases of
crisis management and cyber defense exercises.Engagement in these
activities and in the Federated Mission Networking should be widened
beyond the current range of seven partners.

• [[Establish specialcyber support teamsthat can be deployed to partner
countries to increase interoperability, improve information-sharing and
coordinate responses to cyber crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} Establish
individually-tailored projects and expand existing projectsin accordance
with interests and capacities of partners to enhance their cyber
security and defense. Prospective cooperation areas in cyber defense
include increasing interoperability,sharing strategic and technical
information and threat assessments, coordinating responses to cyber
crisis, and engaging partnersinto NATo's education, exercises and
training activities.

• To support NATo allies' resilience in the cyber security context,
cyber expertsshould be included within NATo Force Integration
Units(NFIU).This would help assess vulnerabilities,increase preparedness
and interoperability in regards with crisis response.

• Assess the levels of the existing maturity of cyber security and
defense capacity in partner countries.Coordinate and synchronize mutual
training and assistance projects with the EU in order to avoid
overlapping.The Partnership Review and Planning Process (PARP) should
include cyber defense elements as part of broader resilience efforts,
and planning should to be aligned with the NATo Defense Planning Process
(NDPP).

• Partners would benefit from the development of minimalrequirements for
the protection of their critical infrastructure and in regards with
cyber defense.

• [[Include resilience and forward resilience components in NATO
exercises,training, education, and operational
planning]{.underline}]{.mark}. Resilience events should be included
especially in NATo Crisis Management Exercises (CMX) and cyber exercises
such as the annual cyber coalition exercises. NATo/Partner exercises
should incorporate forward resilience efforts.

• [Pay attention to societal resilience.]{.underline} Although NATo is
paying most attention to infrastructure,networks and civil
preparedness,itshould also include into its monitoring, assessment and
support measures considerations of societal resilience, i.e., the
ability of society to maintain rule of law,respect for human rights, and
democratic principles in the face of disruptive challenges.[This is
particularly important from the perspective of maintaining the
Alliance's credibility, cohesion, unity and public support to its
mission.]{.underline}

• [Place renewed emphasis on oversight of implementation, including
novel compliance mechanisms]{.underline}. Peer-review groups (3-5
members making site visits to other member governments to report on
resilience) has worked in otherinternational organizations -- NATo
should consider such mechanisms of naming and shaming as well.

[• Develop a more robust strategiccommunications strategy to address
Russia's information operations]{.underline}, particularly where Moscow
draws on social media and hidden messages that seek to exploit social
and political differences in allied and partnerstates.The StratCom
Center of Excellence in Riga could be used to plan how the EU, NATo, and
partners could connect in order to ensure efficient strategic
communication to counter hybrid threats. This would include suggestions
for both vertical and horizontal organisation and points o contact in
individual countries, as well as NATo and the EU, and should cover the
full spectrum of endeavors, from proactive efforts to crisis management.

Include Finland and Sweden as full partners in these efforts. Both
countries have significant traditions of total defense and societal
security, and would bring significant added value and experience to
these efforts. Finnish experience with territorial defense, border
guards, and whole-ofgovernment approaches to societal security, for
example, or Swedish expertise with addressing asymmetrical dependencies
on externalresource flows, may mean that these countries could be
leaders in cooperative efforts as neighbors seek to enhance their
efforts in such areas.

• [[Forward resilience should be integrated as a high-priority element
of each country's Enhanced Opportunities
Partnership]{.underline}]{.mark} (EOP).

• NATO should also intensify work in the 28+2 format connected to Civil
Emergency Planning, which has not advanced as far as the 28+2 in the
military and political arenas.

### Solvency: Resilience---Lute & Burns Recommendations

#### Resilience measures are necessary to deter hybrid attacks---NATO should lead in developing common standards, leading exercises, and developing new deterrence strategies

[[Deterrence of hybrid]{.underline}]{.mark}, or sub-conventional,
[[attack demands **urgent** attention. NATO is vulnerable]{.mark} to
means short of Article 5's "armed attack" including by cyber attacks,
intimidation]{.underline} by threatening energy cut-offs[, political
subversion]{.underline} by covert agents and funding, [disinformation
campaigns and election interference]{.underline}.58 Russia has already
attacked NATO members in this realm. Examples include the 2007 cyber
attack on Estonia, and interference in 2016 elections in France, the
United States and the United Kingdom's Brexit referendum.59 [NATO
[allies must invest in building national resilience]{.mark}---the
ability to resist such measures and to respond effectively if an attack
occurs. The idea of resilience is not new: Article 3 of the Treaty
commits allies to "...develop their individual and collective capacity
to resist armed attack]{.underline}."60 Today this mandate must extend
below the classic Article 5 threshold where Russia is most likely to
attack.

[Deterrence of hybrid attack]{.underline}, however, [is vastly more
complex]{.underline} than traditional deterrence. Deterrence can be
achieved by denying an attacker's ability to attain objectives and by
increasing the risk of unacceptable punishment for an attack.61 Hybrid
tactics challenge both forms of deterrence. National capabilities
required to deny hybrid objectives extend well beyond traditional
defense and are dispersed among other elements of the government at
multiple levels and even the private sector, complicating integration
and coordination. Cybersecurity and election security illustrate this
point. Further, [[while the first responsibility for resilience lies
with states]{.underline}]{.mark}, both [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and
the EU [[have a responsibility to back up member states]{.underline},
[yet]{.underline}]{.mark} lines of authority between these multilateral
institutions and member states may not be clear, [[common standards are
not established and sharing classified information remains a]{.mark}
persistent [challenge.]{.mark}]{.underline}62 [Deterring by promising
punishment requires clarity on the origin of the attack. Hybrid attacks,
however, are designed to be ambiguous, complicate
attribution]{.underline} and shield the attacker from punishment. As we
have seen in Ukraine, ambiguity and difficulty of attribution stressed
Alliance decision-making and risked paralysis while Russia established
facts on the ground that are hard to reverse. Finally, deterring hybrid
attacks is connected to the drift from NATO's core values discussed in
this report. Moving away from common democratic values opens
vulnerabilities for Russian attacks that aim to erode the cohesion of
the Alliance by exploiting political divisions within and among
allies.63

As a start, [[NATO should define standards for national resilience and
clarify shared responsibilities for deterring hybrid
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}.64 The [[Alliance should be a leader in the
global effort to adapt traditional deterrence principles to the cyber
realm]{.underline}. [Exercises]{.underline}]{.mark} that focus on hybrid
attacks, including at the level of ministers, [[can]{.underline}]{.mark}
illustrate the deterrence challenge and [[lead to refined policies. NATO
could bring together ministers]{.underline}]{.mark} of defense,
ministers of interior and national intelligence officials [[to increase
the value of such exercises. NATO and the EU should coordinate common
standards]{.underline}]{.mark} in member states, with priority on
cybersecurity, election security and countering disinformation. A
priority should be placed on publicly disclosing the nature and source
of hybrid attacks. Russia must be held to account, not allowed to deny,
obfuscate and hide in the shadows. In the longer term, diversifying
energy sources and fully assimilating Russian-speaking minority
populations should be addressed as vulnerabilities that Russia could
exploit.65

The third action focuses on [[building resilience of domestic critical
infrastructures]{.underline}]{.mark}. Doors are locked to keep homes
safe. Likewise[, [all NATO member states should address their digital
insecurity by locking digital doors as individuals, companies, and
countries. The strategic]{.mark} vulnerability to disruption and
sabotage [lies]{.mark} not so much in the military space but [in]{.mark}
the]{.underline} hospital booking system, logistics schedule, power
grid, and thousands of other [mainstream, civilian, mostly privately
owned networks]{.underline}. Based on the 2016 Cyber Defence Pledge, in
which member states committed to improving their ability to protect
their cyber networks[, the [alliance could formulate a NATO
cyber-security baseline with concrete resilience goals to achieve or
maintain the baseline. These resilience goals could then be apportioned
among member states in the same way as the defense-planning capability
targets. This should come with obvious financial and investment
implications]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [P]{.underline}]{.mark}[ublic
debates on burden sharing within NATO for too long have focused on how
much member states spend on defense in isola- tion, without adequate
prioritizing where those funds are going.]{.underline} Member states
should be rethink defense spending relative to emerging threats and
collec- tive security challenges. [To ensure funding for cyber security
is appropriately prioritized, [NATO should strengthen a commitment to
digital defense spending]{.mark}]{.underline}, building on the strong
base it has developed in terms of doctrine, standards, and requirements.
[[This also includes strengthening the political resilience of member
states by broadening NATO consultations to include more areas of
government]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Regular North Atlantic Council-format
meetings among member state directors of cyber authorities at the
political and military levels would help build consensus on cyber policy
issues.]{.underline}

[[Another course of action for NATO in cyber security is to increase its
cyber capacity-building efforts for partner countries]{.mark} of
strategic impor- tance]{.underline}, reinforcing NATO's commitment to
partners and projecting stability in NATO's neighborhood. [This kind of
cyber capacity-building could include various types of support, ranging
from strategic advice and cyber institution-building in defense sectors
to education and training or advice and assis- tance in cyber defense.
[The objective should to be to enable capacity-building activities for
military acto]{.mark}rs, along with the provision of training, equip-
ment, and infrastructure for security purposes. [This would allow NATO
to improve the capacities of part- ners]{.mark} to address crises,
prevent conflicts, and cater for their own security and stability by
themselves, to the benefit of their population.]{.underline}

As one example, [NATO could fill a gap in capacity- building for partner
countries by bringing together military]{.underline} Computer Emergency
Response Teams ([CERTs)]{.underline} [to share information]{.underline}
on incident manage- ment dynamics, a [key factor in modern cyber
defense]{.underline}. While partner countries can receive support from
donors in establishing mechanisms and processes to exchange information
between civilian CERTs, such cooperation and communication channels are
much less developed in the military domain due in large part to the high
sensitivity of the information. [There is a need to extend the
information-sharing practices used in civilian circles to partner
countries' military CERTs. Building cyber-security capacity should focus
on partners' ability to respond to and recover from cyber
incidents]{.underline}.

In sum, most future conflicts will have cyber components that require a
technical, political, and diplomatic response. [Whether the adversary is
a state's elite unit or a criminal group rendering ransomware as a
service, cyber security is about risk management and solid, pragmatic
defense and response measures to improve the security of the digital
environment]{.underline}. [There is a technical aspect to hardening
defenses and building redundancy in data and services, but the core of
resilience lies in leadership that does not ignore the problem. How our
national cyber-security strategies are translated into policies and
procedures needs to be understood by all stakeholders.]{.underline} It
is now up to the alliance's member states to provide clarity and
coherence to successfully draft a new Strategic Concept that includes
defense and deterrence. But this is not a job for NATO alone---it
requires close coordination across national governments and the private
sector, and [[NATO and the European Union must therefore continue to
work very closely on this vital issue.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Action Plan for the Next Five Years

[[To make NATO future-proof, it must be cyber-secure and
operational]{.underline}]{.mark}. But is it doing enough to address the
complex and evolving challenges of cyberspace? [[NATO's]{.mark}
strategic c[hallenge is to blend its successful conventional
deterrence]{.mark} functions [with a new strategy for cyber
action]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [NATO's ability to send a collective
message of resistance and to establish a credible threat response is its
most valuable asset]{.underline}]{.mark} [on the cyber-security
front.]{.underline}

Four sets of actions for NATO are proposed. First, [denying covertness
by attribution: NATO should persuade opponents that they cannot be
clandestine in their cyber actions]{.underline}. NATO and its members
need to demonstrate that it is difficult or impossible to act covertly
and be clear about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks.

Until recently, governments did not publicly release details on cyber
incidents. [But since 2018, public disclosures of cyberattacks by
several Western powers indicate a new multinational policy of state
transpar- ency. The growing relevance of attribution is partially due to
states becoming better at attributing cyber operations]{.underline}.1
Greater public knowledge of cyberattacks heightens awareness of cyber
conflicts and leads to greater public acceptance of cyber
countermeasures.

Ultimately[, what matters is that states engaging in unlawful actions
using cyber means will face conse- quences. With attribution,
policymakers show that they know what is happening in these networks and
can investigate incidents]{.underline}. It also clearly spells out
unacceptable behavior and can help create state prac- tice. The [best
way to implement the international norms is by calling out behavior and
having conse- quences when these norms are breached]{.underline}.
Attribu- tion will make clear to the malicious actor that their actions
will be seen and addressed. It is the basis, under international law,
for countermeasures and self-defense.

When should states publicly attribute cyberat- tacks? [Effective public
attribution requires a clear understanding of the attributed cyber
operation and the cyber-threat actor, but also the broader geopo-
litical environment, allied positions and activities, and the legal
context]{.underline}. The [public attribution frame- work]{.underline}
put forward by Max Smeets and Florian Egloff in March 202127
[distinguishes four factors that act as enablers or constraints in
public attribution. These factors are intelligence, incident severity,
geopolitical context, and post-attribution actions.]{.underline} The
combina- tion of these four components enables consistent deci-
sion-making about whether to publicly disseminate information about an
adversary's actions, privately tell the adversary, or restrict knowledge
of the intrusion to the government and potentially other partners.

[Collecting and processing intelligence---infor- mation about foreign
countries and their agents--- provides a technical basis for
attribution]{.underline}. How could allies improve intelligence sharing
to conduct more rapid attribution and enable a response to adver- sary
cyber activity? During the Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers meeting in
Tallinn in September 2020, a 90-minute tabletop exercise was organized28
to test the ministers' ability to respond to and attribute an esca-
lating cyberattack. They answered multiple-choice questions on
communication of and possible diplo- matic countermeasures to the
attack. The minis- ters learned through first-hand experience that a
timely exchange of technical intelligence can be key in attributing any
cyberattack. "The shared view \[of the countries involved\]---especially
when it comes to complicated issues---is crucial," said Urmas Reinsalu,
Foreign Minister of Estonia.29

[Attribution is only as good as the information that allies are willing
to share. NATO's value can be in becoming the preferred platform for
sharing cyber information]{.underline}. General Paul Nakasone, who heads
US Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on
intelligence that "in 35 years" he has never seen a better sharing of
accu- rate, timely, and actionable intelligence than what has transpired
with Ukraine.30 [[Sharing information and intelligence with allies
"builds coalitions" and can "shine a light on disinformation"
campaigns]{.underline}]{.mark}, like the one Russia used to lay the
groundwork for their invasion of Ukraine.

As the second course of action[, [NATO should use the current crisis to
accelerate the progress with setting up NATO's own cyber command and
sharpen allied responses to malicious cyber
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Overall, this would give more
credibility to its cyber defense]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} In
February 2019, allies endorsed a set of tools to respond to cumulative
cyber activities, but not much has happened to take it forward. [[It is
now time to]{.mark} build upon this set and [develop concrete steps at
the political, military, and technical levels to model alli- ance
behavior according]{.mark} to the threat landscape.]{.underline} This
means a sharper focus on future responses to high- and low-end
cyberattacks along with concrete deter- rence actions and tools for
individual sectors and target types. [Much of this is based on the
high-end cyber capabilities of select individual allies called
"volunteer sovereign cyber effects," where cyber- capable nations
deliver voluntarily offensive cyber effects on a target designated by an
operational-levelcommander]{.underline}. The [[NATO Cyber Command would
be responsible for matching military needs with the willingness and
capabilities of the nations potentially able to deliver such
effects]{.underline}.31]{.mark} [The alliance should clarify which
allies are responsible for offensive cyber operations against certain
targets and the informa- tion-sharing and notification
requirements.]{.underline}

[[A good plan requires practice]{.mark}. The [scenarios of cyber
responses]{.mark} that are under the Article 5 threshold [should be
regularly practiced]{.mark}, and the NATO Cooper- ative Cyber Defense
Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) Locked Shields exercise is a good way to
do so]{.underline}. Orga- nized since 2010, it enables cyber-security
experts to enhance their skills in defending national IT systems and
critical infrastructure under real-time attacks. [The [focus should be
on realistic scenarios]{.mark} simulating the entire complexity of a
massive cyber incident, including strategic decision-making and legal
and communication aspects. Locked Shields is a unique opportunity to
encourage experimentation, training, and cooperation among allies in an
authentic but safe training environment]{.underline}.

[[NATO should also make more use of its Cyber
Range]{.underline}]{.mark}, a platform for NATO exercises and training
in Estonia operated by the Estonian Ministry of Defense. [The Cyber
Range already facilitates NATO's flagship annual cyber defense exercise
Cyber Coalition, and NATO CCDCOE has based Locked Shields on Cyber Range
for over a decade. The versatility and computing power of the platform
allows a different, complex scenario to be simulated every year for an
increasing number of participants. The technical, red-teaming exercise
CrossedSwords, organized by NATO CCDCOE, tests the capabilities and
skills needed when executing a full-spectrum cyber operation in real
life, focusing on experimentation with integrating kinetics and
offensive cyber operations in the context of a modern
battlefield]{.underline}. [[More operational- and technical-level joint
activ- ities should be practiced]{.underline}]{.mark} among allies and
with like- minded partners in order to contribute to imposing costs to
malicious actors in cyberspace[. Given that NATO's cyber response teams
are stretched thin due to protecting NATO's own networks, bi- and
[multilateral collaboration enables countries to share best practices
and,]{.mark} in the event of an emergency, [provide mutual rapid
assistance in crisis response.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[cyber exercise Baltic Ghost originated]{.underline}]{.mark} from a
series of cyber defense workshops [[in 2013]{.underline}]{.mark} and
should be expanded to include all NATO battlegroups in the Baltics and
Poland. [Currently it is facilitated by the United States European
Command with the objective to develop and sustain cyber partnerships
between Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania on one end, and the Mary- land,
Michigan, and Pennsylvania Army National Guards on the other
end]{.underline}. [[Building on the success of Baltic Ghost, regular
cyber exercises should take place in multinational NATO
battlegroups]{.underline}]{.mark}, [led by the United Kingdom, Canada,
Germany, and the United States, in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and
Poland.]{.underline} [Fu[ture exercises should regularly support NATO
enhanced forward presence forces and train participants]{.mark} to
respond to aggression in a contested, degraded, and denied cyberspace
environment.]{.underline}

[EU-NATO cooperation has always presented a challenge due to the
differences in the makeup of each organization's
membership]{.underline}. There are signs that [[the relationship could
be warming up: the EU and NATO signed a technical
arrangemen]{.mark}t]{.underline} in February 2016 [[to increase
information sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} between the NCIRC and
CERT-EU.65 The agreement authorizes technical information sharing to
improve incident prevention, detection, and response, and is s i m i l a
r t o U . S . i n f o r m a t i o n - s h a r i n g requirements between
government agencies. While information sharing within the American
federal government has been ongoing since 2004, it is now becoming more
effective than ever due to improvements in information-sharing software,
hardware, and procedures, and the adoption of standard technical
specifications. Furthermore, two nonNATO EU countries are members of the
CCD COE, and the EU and non-NATO members participate in or observe
various NATO-related cyber exercises.

[Ultimately, the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and Europe
would benefit from an EU-NATO-U.S. triangle]{.mark}, [where the Allies
could work together within NATO to further develop joint cyber defense
capabilities and approaches]{.mark}. The [EU]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [could simultaneously work
bilaterally to achieve shared objectives on other cybersecurity
matters]{.mark}.]{.underline} [A joint policy agenda between these two
powers could include convergence between EU and U.S. security standards
for cyber products and services]{.underline}, including joint
procurements in less sensitive areas; collaborative exercises; more
structured information sharing; continued development and elevation of
international cyber crime law enforcement regimes; and consistent and
practical data protection regulations.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[has much to contribute to the cyber operations of NATO and the EU, and
can serve as a force to bring these two organizations closer
together]{.mark}.]{.underline} [American law enforcement and the deep
cybersecurity talent reserves of its private sector have already proven
to be invaluable partners in **Europol**]{.underline}'s cyber crime
investigations. [The trend toward globalized impacts from cyber threats
makes it likely that partnerships on matters of law enforcement and
cybersecurity in general will continue to grow.]{.underline} A few areas
in which the United States, NATO, and the EU could further cooperate on
cybersecurity policy include combined cyber forensics training to
improve attribution, more widespread support for resilience and
remediation practices, and greater coordination between the U.S. and EU
judicial regimes when it comes to bringing cybercriminals to justice.

### EU Link: No Tradeoff

[The [EU and NATO have respectively made tremendous progress in building
their capacity to coordinate cybersecurity]{.mark} and defense
activities]{.underline} among their members. [The [increasing
willingness on the part of these organizations to work more
closely]{.mark} with one another and international partners [is]{.mark}
also a [promisin]{.mark}g,]{.underline} if recent,
[development]{.underline}. Europol's multilateral law enforcement
operations against cybercriminal groups and forums represent one of the
best emerging models for international resource pooling and operational
coordination. In fact, the crucial role that international law
enforcement must play in combatting the global cyber threat qualifies
entities such as Europol for a more elevated role in international
diplomacy. However, cyber crime is only one piece of the larger puzzle
of cybersecurity and cyber defense. The [[recent successes of
coordinated law enforcement operations will reach their full potential
for positive impact only if NATO and the EU apply lessons
learned]{.mark} from that realm to broader cyber policy
issues.]{.underline}

Overall, the [cyber threat landscape is pushing national governments and
international organizations toward greater transatlantic security
cooperation. With a growing cyber threat from nation-state
actors]{.underline}, including a resurgent Russia, [and a new norm of
conflict that ensures kinetic operations will be paired with cyber
aggression for the foreseeable future, [security cooperation in Europe
and around the world is increasingly
necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The strides that NATO and the
EU have made thus far to address cyber threats are promising but
ultimately only foundational. These organizations must build on this
foundation by continuing to make progress toward cross-border
integration of information, capabilities, and defensive strategies if
the advantage in cybersecurity is ever to be wrested from the attacker

While advances have been made in NATO mobility and readiness in recent
years, arms control with Russia is collapsing, and the transatlantic
community has largely failed to address new threats collectively,
including cyber and digital security, health security and the challenges
of a more assertive China. The [[COVID-induced]{.mark} global economic
[recession will stress NATO nations']{.mark} defense
spending]{.underline} and the ambitious defense capabilities goals of
NATO and the EU. While some on both sides of the Atlantic are hoping for
a return to "normal" with the Biden administration, [[the old

today's challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Within NATO, and in U.S.--EU and NATO--EU relations,]{.mark}

### EU Solvency: Division of Labor Fails

#### Division of labor fails---only joint action can address threat posed by Russia and China

Defending Cyber and Outer Space," WASHINGTON QUARTERLY v. 45 n., 1,

And yet, [in the event of US involvement in using force in a conflict
with China, it is likely that Washington would redeploy forces stationed
in and near Europe]{.underline} to the Indo-Pacific. [In the absence of
a European commitment to participate in countering China challenges, and
if forced to choose, the IndoPacific is likely to trump Europe on the US
list of security priorities. This scenario has given rise to the
argument that to restore the credibility of NATO's collective defense
commitment, a division of labor between the United States and Europe
would be desirable]{.underline}. Such an arrangement would allow the US
and its Asian allies to focus on countering China threats in the
Indo-Pacific, while Europe concentrates on countering Russian threats,
providing more effective defenses collaboratively against threats from
China and Russia.17

[[Rather than highlighting the need for a division of labor within NATO,
the 2022 invasion has highlighted that Russia's appetite for threatening
Europe with military action is closely entwined with its long-standing
strategic cooperation with China]{.underline}]{.mark}. Intelligence
reports that China told Russia in February 2022 not to invade Ukraine
before the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing testify to the closely
orchestrated Chinese-Russian approach to the West.18 [[Moscow and
Beijing are both strategic opponents of the US]{.mark}, [a shared status
that has spurred them to coordinate their separate geostrategic
priorities]{.mark} in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, forging unison
pushback against what they consider Western encroachments on their
spheres of interest]{.underline}.19 The poorer than expected performance
of the Russian armed forces in its 2022 war with Ukraine has pushed
China to try to appear neutral. Nevertheless, China has joined Russia in
opposing further enlargement of NATO, and in the Indo-Pacific, Russia
has joined China in opposing Taiwanese independence.[20 It would be wise
for Europe and the US to plan for Sino-Russian geostrategic coordination
to continue]{.underline} unless more clear evidence that China will
abandon Russia is presented. One thing is certain: [China will work with
the partners that help it advance a Sinocentric international order
based on authoritarian regimes. And to counter this development, Europe
and the United States need to devise effective mechanisms for joint
responses to Beijing as well as to Moscow.]{.underline}

[[A US-European division of labor is not likely to help NATO develop
tools to defend itself against threats]{.mark} from China and Russia.
[The lack of electronic warfare in Russia's war with Ukraine has
revealed gaps between its concept of operations and the tactics of the
Ukrainian military]{.mark}]{.underline}. As demonstrated in prior
operations in Syria and the Donbas, Russia [will adapt and learn in the
short and long term]{.underline}. For example, Russia can be expected to
improve its electromagnetic spectrum management in order to enhance its
planning and management of forces on the battlefield. [Meanwhile, China
is watchin]{.underline}g the performance of the parties involved in the
war w[ith a view to update its cyber and space capabilities as well as
strategic concepts. As a consequence, [both Russian and Chinese threats
will continue to increasingly emerge in the cyber]{.mark}]{.underline}
and space domains. [[This calls for global and functional defenses
rather than an exclusive geographical focus. It is more important than
ever to design NATO for a future where threats toward transatlantic
security are global and requires a unified
response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### NATO needs to act on the military side---necessary to solve our China impacts

NATO's Role in the Global Commons

[NATO can only be as effective as its member states allow it to be. NATO
reflects the state of transatlantic relations: are US and European
security outlooks sufficiently compatible such that the alliance is able
to address threats from China collectively]{.underline}? [This question
is reflected in how well they manage to define common challenges and
establish mechanisms that allow them to address these challenges
together. NATO was a natural center of security focus for Washington
when Europe was the main arena for US-Soviet deterrence. Today, the
IndoPacific competes for US attention and resources as competition with
China has moved to the center stage of US security and defense
priorities.]{.underline}

[The strategic shift in US priorities does not mean that Europe cannot
continue to remain a significant influence on global security dynamics.
The EU has demonstrated its continued relevance in the security
realm,]{.underline} not merely by relying on its role as a major trade
bloc, but also by reforming the interplay between member states and EU
institutions to avoid being paralyzed by consensus requirements, which
apply in most areas outside the trade sector. This is done by providing
platforms for member states to start initiatives. If successful in
attracting support within the union, the initiatives are consolidated by
supportive mechanisms and programs.43

[[NATO is not the EU and hence should not duplicate its methods]{.mark}.
The EU is driven by the urge to secure the continued influence of its
member states on]{.underline} major global issues. [[NATO's raison
d'être is to facilitate transatlantic cooperation]{.mark} in the
military sector to counter common threats and challenges. [Coordination
is complex at a time when US and European security outlooks are drifting
apart]{.mark}]{.underline} in terms of threat perceptions and
priorities. At the same time, [fears of entrapment stifle NATO's efforts
to update its relevance]{.underline}, principally because key members
such as France and Germany are not interested in NATO taking on China as
a threat.

Nevertheless, [[NATO's agreement to define China as a challenge promises
opportunities for positioning the alliance in a key role in
transatlantic relations. Because cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and space
[[encompass threats from other adversaries]{.mark} such as Russia and
Iran, [these domains are a good place to start taking on China as they
do not require that China be singled out as a threat. By taking on the
responsibility for coordinating US and European definitions of
cyber]{.mark} and outer space [threats]{.mark} in the military sector,
integrating these domains in all organizational and operational NATO
structures, devising mechanisms for the member states to address cyber
and outer space threats, [and by facilitating intelligence exchange and
management of]{.mark} the [vulnerabilities]{.mark} produced by
civil-military interaction and overlapping interfaces between the cyber
and space sectors, [NATO can demonstrate its continued relevance for
transatlantic security]{.mark} in an era where threats are increasingly
global and transcend geographical boundaries. [There's no time like the
present]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### EU NB: NATO Key to EU Leadership

#### Turn -- the EU needs NATO for security -- it's a prerequisite to leadership.

**Bugajski 16** (Janusz Bugajski is a senior fellow at the Jamestown
Foundation, 2016, "Only NATO can defend Europe," *European View*, 1(15),
<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1007/s12290-016-0383-9>)

Twenty-five years after the end of the Cold War, [[there is no viable
alternative]{.underline} o]{.mark}n the horizon [[to]{.underline}
[NATO's security umbrella]{.underline}]{.mark} over an expanded Europe.
The idea floated a quarter of a century ago that Europe could scale down
its defences and even dismantle the North Atlantic Alliance exposed a
flawed fixation on an 'end of history' scenario that has never
materialised. In practice, the forces of state nationalism and
imperialist revisionism in Russia have proved stronger than those of
liberalism and international cooperation with the West. In many
respects, a 'return of history' scenario has become more evident in and
around Europe, with Russia re-emerging as a revanchist power and
threatening Europe's entire eastern flank. In addition, [[the
EU]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[faces existential problems]{.mark},
from the financial and institutional to the demographic and
political]{.underline}. [[In a potentially unstable and fracturing
continent]{.underline}, **[NATO is the sole remaining institution that
upholds international security]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [And]{.underline}
it may become [[the **sole** multinational organisation that can provide
Europe with]{.underline}]{.mark} a measure of
**[[coherence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Moreover, [[NATO is the **binding
glue of the transatlantic link** with Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}.
NATO without alternatives Several Western European states have hosted US
bases since the creation of NATO in April 1949. Since the end of the
Cold War and the dismantling of the Soviet bloc in the early 1990s,
numerous voices among the new NATO members have called for permanent
bases that would include US troops in the eastern part of the continent.
Such voices have grown louder as Russia under President Vladimir Putin
has become increasingly assertive and is now threatening the
independence of numerous states, from the Baltic region to the Black and
Caspian Seas. A [NATO]{.underline} alliance that encompasses all of
Europe [with a permanent multinational military presence]{.underline} in
Europe's east [is essential]{.underline} for four fundamental reasons.
First, there is no viable alternative to NATO's political and military
structure. The EU does not provide security or generate confidence among
states facing potential aggression. The EU's Common Foreign and Security
Policy is primarily a diplomatic mechanism, which openly acknowledges
that NATO remains responsible for the territorial defence of Europe.
Although the EU has engaged in several peacekeeping, policing and
humanitarian missions, NATO possesses the main combat force not only of
its European members, but most importantly of the US, which contributes
a disproportionate share of Alliance troops, equipment and other
resources. [A strong NATO alliance is the backbone of European
security]{.underline}. Proposals for a European Army simply dilute and
distract attention from the only capable multinational Western security
organisation. A European Army would not only siphon off NATO's already
limited assets and diminish its capabilities, but would also trigger
rivalries between Europe and North America over the deployment of
military forces. Additionally, it could split Europe between countries
committed to upholding close security relations with the US and states
at a safer distance from Russia that see a lesser need for American
security guarantees. Such an outcome would in effect grant Moscow a
strategic victory over NATO. The second reason an effective
[NATO]{.underline} is needed is that it [contributes to ensuring the
institutional integrity of members]{.underline}, together with promoting
regional stability between them. [Its entry stipulations include
functional statehood, minority rights, civilian control over the
military and settled borders with all neighbours]{.underline}. All new
members have had to fulfil these criteria. Such conditionality also
generates confidence for foreign investors and sets the stage for the
integration of member states into the EU.

The third rationale for an expanded NATO concerns the sovereign choice
of every independent state to determine its alliances and security links
and not remain vulnerable to pressure from predatory neighbours such as
Russia. In this context, it is important to distinguish between Russia's
national interests and Moscow's state ambitions. If Russia's neighbours
join NATO, this poses no threat to Russia's security---contrary to the
Kremlin's claims. However, it does thwart Russia's ability to control
these countries' security postures and foreign policy.

Russia's ambitions revolve around expanding the 'Eurasian' zone in which
Russia is the dominant political player. 'Eurasianism' involves two
interconnected strategies: transforming Europe into an appendage of the
Russian sphere of influence and debilitating Atlanticism by undermining
Europe's connections with the US.

The EU occupies a pivotal position in Russia's strategy as it can either
strengthen or weaken the Kremlin's approach. Moscow views a unified EU
foreign policy that is synchronised with Washington's and undermines
Russia's aspirations as a threat that needs to be neutralised. The EU's
democratisation agenda is also perceived as a pernicious ploy to
undermine Russia's agenda of supporting pliable governments in
neighbouring post-Soviet states. Furthermore, EU standards for
government accountability, business transparency and market competition
endanger Russia's economic penetration, which is primarily based on
opaque and corrupt business practices.

An accommodationist Western approach that concedes some special
'national interests' to Russia not only is unacceptable to all the
independent states that emerged from the Soviet Union and the Soviet
bloc, but also whets Moscow's appetite for further imperial
aggrandisement. Paradoxically, consenting to Russia's asymmetrical
'national interests', through which it claims a privileged role in
influencing its neighbours' affairs, is more likely to result in a
collision with NATO than a more dynamic approach. If the Kremlin
operates with the conviction that it has a free hand to methodically
undermine countries along its borders, this could result in serious
miscalculations when it overreaches by sparking conflicts with Alliance
members.

Emerging threats from Moscow

The fourth and most important reason why a substantial NATO military
presence in Eastern Europe is vital is that it forms the most effective
deterrent and responder to major new threats. Two core challenges
emanate from Russia: expansion and implosion. Moscow's primary objective
is to restore Russia as a major pole of power in a multi-polar world.
The overarching goal with regard to the West is to reverse US influences
in Europe and Eurasia. Russia's neo-imperial project seeks predominant
influence over the foreign and security policies of immediate neighbours
so that they will either remain neutral or support Russia's agenda. In
effect, Russia seeks dependent protectorates along its borders, tied
into institutions controlled from Moscow (Bugajski and Doran 2016).

While its goals are imperial, the Kremlin's strategies and tactics are
flexible, and this can make them more effective than if they were rigid.
Moscow engages in enticements, threats, incentives and pressures, while
claiming it is pragmatically pursuing its national interests. It pursues
asymmetrical offensives by interjecting itself in its neighbours'
affairs, capturing important sectors of local economies, subverting
vulnerable political systems, corrupting national leaders, penetrating
key security institutions, challenging territorial integrity and
undermining international unity.

Moscow is also not averse to using direct military force, as exemplified
by the war against Georgia in August 2008, followed by the forced
partitioning of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and the attack on Ukraine in
March 2014 with the annexation of Crimea. According to a recent report
by RAND Corporation, given current force deployments, Russia could
steamroll across the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with
ground forces reaching the three capitals in a matter of hours. Without
a more intensive regional presence, NATO forces would not have the
ability to defend its most exposed states (Shlapak and Johnson 2016).
Hence, the factor of deterrence may have limited value if Moscow decides
to test NATO's response.

The RAND report mirrors the concerns of Chairman of the NATO Military
Committee General Petr Pavel, who has warned that Moscow could conquer
the three Baltic states within two days despite their NATO membership.
This is possible because of Russia's ongoing military expansion, NATO's
relatively slow-moving command structure, and the decline in Alliance
capabilities because of lowered defence spending and the withdrawal of
US forces, including two heavily armoured US divisions from Germany,
with only two now remaining in Europe.

Russia's potential implosion could present an even more unpredictable
future in which NATO would need to manage the multi-regional
repercussions. A huge failed state on Europe's doorstep would have
various destabilising consequences for the continent---whether refugee
outflows, the spillover of violence, civil wars or the emergence of new
aspiring states. Paradoxically, Putin's attempts to construct a new
Russia-centred dominion are likely to accelerate the country's decline.

An economically and militarily overstretched Russia may witness
escalating economic, social, political and sub-regional turmoil and
present even more menacing challenges for Western policy. NATO needs to
assess the possible consequences of the chaotic downfall of the Putinist
system and prepare contingencies for the conflicts that this may
generate. In particular, Russia's neighbours must be shielded from the
most destabilising scenarios of civil conflict and Russia's violent
fragmentation, which could spill into NATO territory. By positioning
permanent NATO bases in the countries bordering Russia, the Alliance
would be better prepared for the negative consequences.

NATO realism

NATO's European flank remains dependent on the US for its security, as
its defence expenditures have been seriously depleted since the end of
the Cold War. Without American involvement Europe would be unable to
deter an increasingly belligerent Russia. Europe's demilitarisation over
the last decade has coincided with Russia's military build-up (Michta
2015). The US provides 70 % of all NATO defence spending, while Europe's
contribution to NATO's military capability is less than 25 %, and the
figure is steadily falling. Several countries have decimated their
equipment to such an extent that they may be incapable of deploying more
than a few thousand troops in the event of outright war. Meanwhile,
Russia is re-arming to the tune of \$700 billion over the next decade
and plans to introduce the next generation of armour, aircraft and
missiles, and to modernise its nuclear forces.

Since the end of the Cold War, US officials have been prodding their
European counterparts to increase defence spending in line with NATO
guidelines of 2 % of GDP. Several US defence secretaries have challenged
their allies to stop cutting financial support for NATO in the face of
emerging and escalating security threats. They have argued that this
could result in Europe's 'demilitarisation', particularly in Western
Europe, where political leaders and publics are becoming increasingly
averse to the deployment of military force. Shortfalls in funding and
capabilities will make it difficult for the Alliance to handle several
simultaneous security dangers. Over the past decade only a handful of
NATO members have consistently spent 2 % of their GDP on defence. During
2015 the defence budgets of several members, including the UK and
Germany, actually shrank, despite pledges issued at NATO's Wales Summit
in September 2014 to increase financing of the military. In stark
contrast, several front-line NATO states have decided to steadily
increase their defence budgets in the face of growing threats from
Russia. These include Poland, Romania and the three Baltic states.

In addition to increased funding, the European allies must also pursue
military modernisation and become capable of defending all of NATO's
borders rather than operating under the traditional formula of simply
being able to retaliate and allowing the extended deterrent to be
provided primarily by Washington. There are legitimate concerns that
most European states could not realistically meet the goals of optimal
capability without significant reforms to their military structure and
the elimination of waste, duplication and mismanagement in their defence
bureaucracies. If the current feebleness in defence spending and
capabilities continues, the next US president will come under increasing
domestic pressure to curtail the American commitment to Europe's
security. This will certainly suit a revisionist Kremlin that continues
to test NATO's defences along Russia's western flank.

In response to conventional military threats from Russia, it is
essential to have an effective tripwire by ensuring the permanent
presence of soldiers from various NATO states in Estonia, Latvia,
Lithuania and Poland, the most exposed members bordering Russia. Moves
in this direction, through the use of air policing units, regular
military exercises and the creation of small bases to accommodate the
planned NATO Rapid Reaction Force, were taken as the war in Ukraine
unfolded during 2014 and 2015. Nonetheless, fears remained that without
a more permanent stationing of substantial multinational NATO forces in
the front-line states, these countries could be quickly overrun by a
Russian assault.

At a mini-NATO summit in Bucharest on 4 November 2015, nine
countries---Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia,
Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia---signed a declaration calling
on NATO to maintain a permanent presence in the region to deter Russian
aggression. Since Moscow's assault on Ukraine, NATO has taken initial
steps to bolster the defence of vulnerable members by adding combat
aircraft support to NATO's Baltic air policing mission: dispatching a
dozen F-16 fighters to Poland, and deploying Airborne Warning and
Control System reconnaissance aircraft in Poland and Romania to help
patrol NATO's eastern borders. NATO has also drawn up defence plans for
Poland and the Baltic states, including guarantees of NATO's military
response to outside attacks.

Deliberations have also intensified over the potential hosting of NATO
military infrastructure. However, at the NATO Summit on 4--5 September
2014, Alliance leaders did not endorse the positioning of permanent
bases in Eastern Central Europe despite the urging from Warsaw and the
three Baltic governments. Instead, they agreed to create a spearhead
contingent within the existing NATO Response Force---a Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF). Once formed, it would be capable of
deploying at short notice along NATO's periphery and would consist of
land, air, maritime and Special Operations Force components.

It is intended that the VJTF will include 4,000 troops trained to move
on 48 hours' notice to hotspots in any NATO member state. Nonetheless,
this contingent would be too small to counter the massive military might
Russia has deployed along its western frontier. The spearhead force is
to be part of a wider NATO response force of 13,000--30,000 troops that
could take weeks to deploy in a crisis. It will benefit from equipment
and logistics facilities pre-positioned in Eastern Central European
countries, but the troops will not be permanently stationed in the
region (NATO 2015). The force could be used as a mobile tripwire when
dispatched to a threatened state. However, at this stage in its
deployment, it is difficult to estimate the effectiveness of a
relatively small VJTF contingent in deterring Russia's outright invasion
of a NATO member.

In February 2015, NATO decided to establish six command centres in
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Bulgaria to connect
national forces with NATO reinforcements. They will be used for
logistics, reconnaissance and planning missions with a multinational
headquarters in Szczecin, on Poland's Baltic coast. This will enable the
rapid influx of thousands of NATO troops in the event of a crisis. The
positioning of military hardware without the presence of US and other
Allied troops is premised on the assumption that the local armed forces
would be capable of defending the country for a sufficient time to allow
for the timely arrival of more substantial NATO units.

Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey has
stated that America's military is ready to ensure the deployment of high
alert forces within 48 hours to NATO countries bordering Russia (Joinfo
2015). If this is insufficient to stem a Russian attack, then Washington
will be ready to use additional force to protect its allies. General
Philip Breedlove, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander for Europe, has called
Moscow's conquest of Crimea a 'paradigm shift' that requires a
fundamental rethinking of where American forces are located. In February
2016, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the US will
significantly upgrade its commitment to the security of Europe's eastern
flank, with a planned four-fold increase in spending on the European
Reassurance Initiative, from \$790 million to \$3.4 billion.

To maintain NATO as an effective deterrent, Washington needs to adopt a
more forward presence on the 'eastern front'. NATO must also update its
security posture to deal with new threats. For example, the Washington
Treaty should be updated, especially Article 5 and the definition of an
attack on a NATO member. This must reflect the challenges associated
with contemporary warfare, including externally generated insurgencies,
cyber-attacks, information warfare, and other forms of subversion aimed
at undermining state independence or truncating its territory.

The Alliance needs to prepare for a wide assortment of unconventional
threats and ensure that its capabilities match its commitments,
including stronger national capabilities that increase the costs of a
Russian attack (Grygiel and Mitchell 2014). Local forces must possess
the ability to protect their own borders and increase the cost of
aggression even if they cannot win a conflict unaided. In particular,
NATO needs to place greater emphasis on ensuring the ability of
front-line states to defend themselves during the critical, early phases
of a limited war.

Each NATO state bordering Russia requires three fundamental elements:
adequate infrastructure and pre-positioned equipment to allow for the
speedy deployment of other NATO forces, early warning of a Russian
covert attack and capable forces that can respond quickly to an assault
on its territorial integrity. Each country also needs US and Western
European forces positioned in them on a permanent basis to act as a
tripwire against a potential Russian attack. Front-line states also
require an offensive component that can threaten Russia's aggressive
operations by targeting its staging areas, airports, radar
installations, sea and river ports, and logistical nodes (Grygiel 2015).
Defensive capabilities alone are unlikely to be sufficient to deter a
military assault.

Conclusion

For the US an unstable and insecure Europe that is fractured internally
and whose borders are challenged by a belligerent Russia would
constitute the greatest foreign policy disaster since the Second World
War. To prevent such developments, NATO must revive its core mandate of
defending the European homeland and focus less on out-of-area
operations. By shifting bases and equipment eastward to confront the
newest threats, NATO can [help ensure that it has sufficient manpower
and firepower to dissuade a Russian offensive against the most exposed
Alliance members. [An effective NATO remains the key institution for
protecting Europe's security. It may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[become
the **sole multinational organisation that can**]{.underline}]{.mark}
provide the continent with a measure of policy coherence and
**[[maintain the transatlantic link with
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[However, given the situation and the context, it is likely that the
EU\'s military capabilities will remain relatively weak, with NATO
remaining the preferred forum]{.mark} for most European
states]{.underline}. The early adoption of the strategic compass has
prevented it from truly taking into account the ongoing and future
consequences of the war in Ukraine. [The latest version of the project
for a new European rapid reaction force is indicative of this gap. Based
on the existing European Union battle groups, it provides for only a
limited number of troops (around 5,000)]{.underline}, far from reaching
the initial CSDP objectives set in Helsinki (around 50,000). Moreover,
[everything seems to indicate that its field of action would remain
outside the national territory of the EU member states.]{.underline} It
is true that the CSDP is part of the Common Foreign and Security Policy
(CFSP), not the internal one. However[, [refusing to change the possible
theatres of operation of the rapid reaction force amounts to condemning
it]{.mark},]{.underline} [as the Eastern European states give priority
to their territorial defence over external operations]{.underline} in
Africa or the Middle East[. [This position]{.mark} of the Eastern
Europeans, which existed before the Russian invasion, [can only be
strengthened]{.mark} following it.]{.underline} [[By extension, it is
likely that this will also affect the development of the EU\'s military
headquarters]{.mark},]{.underline} a headquarters developed from the
current Military Planning and Conduct Capability. [[Better coordination
and understanding with NATO could avoid this scenario, but would require
Paris to propose closer collaboration]{.mark} between the two
institutions.]{.underline}

### Unilat Solvency: China Deficit

#### U.S. unilateralism pushes European allies towards China

accessed 4-24-22\]

[U.S. unilateralism has traditionally pushed the Europeans towards
advancing the so-called 'strategic autonomy', including the promotion of
ties with Beijing. It is no coincidence that the EU-China strategic
partnership and Sino-European space cooperation were established during
the early 2000s when the Europeans were in deep disagreement over the
Iraq War]{.underline}.

An issue that could trigger the next transatlantic rift over China is
the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI), an accord that if
ratified would boost trade and investment relations between the EU and
China as well as have profound implications for the United States.

### Unilat Solvency: Hybrid Deficit

#### Multilateral action is the only way to deal with hybrid threats

Influence, Hybrid CoE, "Deterrence: Proposing a More Strategic Approach
to Countering Hybrid Threats," HYBRID COE PAPER 2, Hybrid Centre of
Excellence, 3---20, p. 8\]

[[Although the primary responsibility for dealing with hybrid threats is
at the national level]{.underline}]{.mark} (recognized by both EU and
NATO), [[hybrid threats **transcend** national borders]{.underline},
[making multilateral cooperation **essential**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[The [**nature** of the **threat** means that states **need** to **work
together** with allies]{.mark} and partners.]{.underline} Most
importantly, the EU, NATO and other multilateral [[organisations have
numerous means at their disposal which can either support denial of
hostile activities or impose costs on hostile actors. **Collective**
action]{.underline}]{.mark} in political, diplomatic or economic
domains, multinational attribution, or strategic messaging
[[will]{.mark} often [be **more effective** than national
effort]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Unilat Solvency: Interconnectness Defiict

#### Unilateral action fails\--interconnecteness

**Hamilton, Johns Hopkins Professor, '16**

Executive Director of the Center for Transatlantic Relations at Johns
Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies,

Nonetheless, [no nation is home alone in an age of potentially
catastrophic terrorism, networked threats and disruptive hybrid
attacks,.]{.underline} Fe[w critical infrastructures that sustain the
societal functions of an individual country are limited today to the
national borders of that country. Social cohesion within a given country
can be affected by flows o]{.underline}f goods,services, money, data,
energy, or simply people---[whether refugees or radical elements who
cooperate and operate across borders.]{.underline}

[This means that traditional notions of territorial security must be
supplemented with actions to address flow security---protecting critical
links that bind societiesto one another.Governments accustomed to
protecting their territories must also focus on protecting their
connectedness. Th]{.underline}is requires greater attention to shared
resilience. None of NATo's seven baseline requirements for resilience,
for instance, can be met without attention to shared resilience.

### Too soon

#### Too early to predict midterm results

Mark **Brewer May 19**, 2022, "The 2022 Midterm Elections," UNIVERSITY
OF MAINE, https://umaine.edu/polisci/the-2022-midterm-elections/

But [in **[politics few things are certain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and
sweeping losses for the Democrats in [[the 2022 midterms are no
exception]{.underline}]{.mark}. While their current situation looks
grim, there are some reasons to believe that Democrats could avoid the
worst, if not even (admittedly, in a best case scenario for Dems)
maintain control of at least one chamber of Congress. The underlying
economy remains strong, and if economic growth continues and perhaps
even accelerates this will likely work to the Democrats' advantage.

While President Biden's overall approval rating is low, his approval
rating on his handling of the crisis in Ukraine is quite high. If
Americans continue to view the president favorably here, this will
almost certainly boost Democratic congressional candidates as well. A
summer relatively free of COVID restrictions would also likely boost
Dems, and this increasingly looks like a real possibility. Democrats
have also figured out to gerrymander themselves, which has resulted in a
number of states with improved electoral maps for the party. Also, it is
possible that Republicans will nominate at least some highly polarizing
candidates who might struggle in November. And speaking of candidates,
former President Donald Trump is not on the ballot this November, but he
is still very much at the front and center of the Republican Party and
of American politics. Democrats have had success running against Trump
in the past, and they could do so again.

So [[which way will it turn out]{.underline}]{.mark}? **[[It is too
early to say]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [But we can say with almost
absolute certainty that]{.underline} [[it will be an exciting election
season]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The Republican Party rarely polls ahead of Democrats on the generic
ballot, according to political scientist Lara Brown, who directs the
Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University.
For Democrats to come back and win elections, they need to make
significant gains in public support. But, she added, [**[it's too

How **[things could change before November for Democrats]{.underline}**.
[The Supreme Court is poised to]{.underline} likely [overturn Roe v.
Wade]{.underline} and let states ban abortion in the coming weeks, for

shootings, Gallup notes, as [polling shows most Americans favor stricter

Mark **Brewer May 19**, 2022, "The 2022 Midterm Elections," UNIVERSITY

#### Dems have a strong chance to maintain control post-midterms -- their ev is hype

midterm elections are better than doomsayers predict," MSNBC,
https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/democrats-chances-2022-midterm-elections-are-better-doomsayers-predict-n1290695

[Anyone else sick and tired of hearing so-called political experts
predict that Democrats are going to lose badly in this year\'s
midterms]{.underline}? Apparently it doesn't matter that in President
Joe Biden's first year, 6.6 million new jobs were reported, the
strongest first year of job gains of any president since our government
began collecting such data in 1939. Nor does it appear to matter that
unemployment is down from 6.7 percent in former President Donald Trump's
last full month in office to 3.8 percent and that wages are up 5 percent
over the past year.

[[Pundits tell us it's an "ironclad" rule]{.mark} --- as
Fivethirtyeight.com put it --- [that the president's party loses]{.mark}
congressional seats in [midterm elections]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Hence,
[headlines]{.mark} that [predict Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s will lose]{.mark}
this November [in a]{.mark} "wipeout" and a "[bloodbath]{.mark}." If you
listen to these people, [you might be tempted to cancel the]{.mark} 2022
[election and simply crown the GOP]{.mark} the winners of the House and
the Senate]{.underline}.

[Democrats should be concerned going into November]{.underline}. They
hold only a nine-seat margin in the House, and the Senate is divided
50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tie-breaking vote.
[[However]{.mark}, there are [multiple signs]{.mark} that [tell us
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [could]{.mark} not only **[hold on to the
House]{.mark}** but [even **pick up**]{.mark} **a few [Senate
seats]{.mark}** given that there is an open Senate seat in Pennsylvania
and a vulnerable GOP incumbent in Wisconsin, both states Biden won in
2020]{.underline}.

For starters, while Biden won the White House [[in 2020, Democrats lost
13 seats]{.mark} in the House. That wasn't good for the party,
obviously, but for 2022 purposes, it means [the most vulnerable]{.mark}
Democrats [are already gone]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[On the flip
side]{.mark}, not a single Republican incumbent in the House lost in
2018. Good luck with GOP pulling that trick twice and not losing even
one of the 213 House seats they currently hold in 2022. For example, in
New York, [the]{.mark} recently [finalized]{.mark} congressional [map
that reflects]{.mark} the 2020 [census data is expected to result
in]{.mark} [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s picking up]{.mark} three current
Republican [seats]{.mark} in November]{.underline}.

Plus, [[history tells us that there have been two times]{.mark} in the
modern era that [a president's party gained seats]{.mark} during midterm
elections ---and [the circumstances]{.mark} that led to those victories
[apply to 2022]{.mark} in varying degrees]{.underline}. [In
[1998]{.mark}, with Bill Clinton in the White House, Democrats gained
five House seats. How did Democrats buck history? [GOP arrogance and
overreach]{.mark}]{.underline}. The House GOP, led by then-Speaker Newt
Gingrich, impeached Clinton for lying about his affair with an intern,
Monica Lewinsky. But as midterm exit polls found, two thirds of voters
didn't think Clinton --- who was leading a strong economy --- should
have been impeached, and they cast their votes accordingly.

[Today's GOP is even more arrogant and heavy-handed than Gingrich's GOP
was. Consider]{.underline} the Texas law that bans
[abortion]{.underline} after six weeks and forces a woman who is raped
to carry her rapist's fetus to term. That abomination of a law is being
copied by numerous Republican-controlled states despite the fact that
[65 percent of Americans believe the Supreme Court should uphold its
landmark Roe v. Wade decision and only 29 percent support the Supreme
Court striking down the constitutional right to abortion access. The
[Republicans don't care what]{.mark} a majority of [Americans
think]{.mark}; they only care about imposing their extreme religious
beliefs upon the rest of us]{.underline}.

[Ditto for the party's overreach by banning books and what they wrongly
call critical race theory]{.underline} (CRT). Americans are becoming
increasingly aware that so-called CRT bans are racist laws designed to
prevent teachers from sharing the history of Black achievement and Black
suffering at the hands of white bigots. Look at Virginia where
Republican Glenn Youngkin won the governor's race in 2021 based in part
on his attacks on CRT. A recent poll found that 57 percent of Virginians
oppose banning CRT and only 37 percent support it. That finding helps
explain why Youngkin, who won in November with 51 percent of the vote,
is already underwater with a 41 percent approval rating.

With only a few exceptions, these extreme abortion bans, bans on books
and CRT, and voter suppression efforts in 19 states are embraced by
Republicans nationwide. To animate their own voters, Democrats can and
should use the GOP's tyranny against them in 2022.

[The second time [in]{.mark} recent history that a president's party
picked up seats during a midterm election was [2002]{.mark}, the year
[after]{.mark} the [9/11]{.mark} terrorist attacks, when President
George W. Bush was in the White House with a sky-high approval rating
and [Republicans gained]{.mark} eight House [seats]{.mark} and two in
the Senate]{.underline}.

[While Jan. 6, 2021, and 9/11 are not nearly the same, [the 2022
election will be the first after]{.mark} the "[domestic terrorism" waged
on the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters]{.mark} trying to prevent the
peaceful transfer of power]{.underline}. The big difference, of course,
is that after 9/11, Americans united against those who attacked us. In
contrast, the GOP overwhelmingly supports and celebrates former
President Donald Trump, who radicalized his supporters with lies about
the election and called them to Washington to "stop the steal." Since
then, Trump has defended the attackers and suggested he would pardon
them if he were elected president again.

Republicans want 2022 to be a referendum on Biden's performance given
that his approval ratings are in the low 40s, but
[[Democrats]{.underline}]{.mark} should turn the tables and frame the
election as a referendum on Republican extremism: from the oppressive
laws mentioned above to their embrace of the man who gave us Jan. 6.
That [[could **spike**]{.underline}]{.mark} Democratic
[turnout]{.underline}.

### UQ -- GOP overwhelms the link -- it's a lock

#### The strength of their uniqueness cards proves the election can't be reversed -- whatever is "baked in" now will only strengthen with time

Henry **Olsen June 1**, 2022, senior fellow at the Ethics and Public
Policy Center, "The GOP midterm wave is set --- and Democrats can't do
anything about it" WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/01/gop-midterm-wave-is-set-democrats-cant-do-anything-about-it/

Recent political history shows that [the course of a fall election is
almost always **set** by **Memorial Day**]{.underline}.
RealClearPolitics Senior Elections Analyst Sean Trende recently noted
that "[election outcomes are more-or-less **baked in**" by the end of
the second quarter of an election year. Not even the financial crash of
2008 made a significant dent in that year's outcome]{.underline}, which
Trende says was largely expected in May of that year. [One probably
needs to go back to the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 to find an event
that might have significantly helped the party in power on the eve of a
midterm vote]{.underline}.

[Political waves]{.underline} also [take predictable courses, and the
final outcome is **almost always worse for the losing party than
analysts predicted six months out**]{.underline}. In May 2010, the
Rothenberg Political Report (now Inside Elections with Nathan L.
Gonzales) projected a big Republican year, with GOP House gains of two
to three dozen seats. Their final pre-election forecast predicted gains
between 55 and 65 seats. The GOP ultimately picked up 63 from Democrats.

[For Democrats this year, the only real question is whether the

terrible]{.underline}.

If you think like a weather forecaster, all kinds of [data point to a
major storm]{.underline}. [By]{.underline} basically [every
metric]{.underline} you can think of --- fundraising, candidate
recruitment, voter enthusiasm, demographic shifts --- [a big wave is
forming that will sweep hundreds of Democrats out of office, up and down

Alison **Durkee June 14**, 2022, "Democrats' Midterm Nightmare: Polls

https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2022/06/14/democrats-midterm-nightmare-polls-suggest-party-could-face-historic-loss/?sh=36b8783f5193

[Democrats could experience a "greater-than-average" loss in the midterm
elections this November]{.underline}, new Gallup polling suggests,
finding that [voters' satisfaction with the country and federal
government are largely at record lows compared with other midterm
years]{.underline}.

The Gallup poll, conducted May 2-22 among 1,007 U.S. adults, found only
41% approve of President Joe Biden's job performance, 18% approve of
Congress' performance and 16% are "satisfied with the way things are
going in the U.S."

Only 14% have a positive view of economic conditions right now and 46%
rate the economy negatively, meaning Americans have a 32-point net
negative view of the economy.

All of those [metrics are at least 10 points below the average for
midterm years, based on Gallup's polling going back to
1974]{.underline}.

Americans have a 51% approval rating for the president on average during
midterm election years, a 30% congressional approval rating, 35%
satisfaction with the state of the U.S. and a nine-point net positive
rating of the economy.

Other than presidential approval rating---where Biden's 41% approval is
tied with former President Donald Trump's in 2018 and higher than
President George W. Bush's 38% in 2006---every metric recorded this year
marks a historic low.

Gallup suggests the [low ratings mean Democrats will likely lose seats
in the election this year---as a president's party typically does during
the midterms---and their **losses would likely be even larger than
usual**]{.underline} if these low ratings hold.

#### Dems cannot win -- history, logic, Biden's limitations

Ed **Kilgore March 10**, 2022. "Biden's War Bounce Isn't Big Enough to
Save the Midterms," INTELLIGENCER,
https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2022/03/bidens-war-bounce-isnt-big-enough-to-save-the-midterms.html

The question we really can't answer now is whether future developments
in Ukraine will help or hurt Biden's popularity. Short of an outright
Russian defeat or the deployment of U.S. troops, [it's not easy to
envision a trajectory of events that will greatly affect Biden's
standing]{.underline}. The short-term economic fallout is likely to be
negative; if [it's very negative, and]{.underline} Biden fails to make a
Churchillian appeal for sacrifice, it could make it [very hard for him
to recover popular support]{.underline} for the most important "real
life" indicator, [particularly among independents]{.underline}.

[What we do know is **the party controlling [the White House almost
always loses]{.mark} ground in [the midterms]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[except for rare occasions where the president was unusually popular.
And even if [Biden's]{.mark} job-approval rating stabilizes or modestly
improves, he's [a long way from what he'd need for his party to triumph
in November]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Vox's Andrew Prokop recently put
it:

[[The historical pattern is clear, and ominous for]{.mark} Joe Biden and
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} this year: The president's party usually
does poorly in midterm elections.]{.underline}

"[[It's]{.mark} not quite **[a law of physics]{.mark}**, but it's
probably as close as you're going to get [in the social
sciences]{.mark}]{.underline}," says Carlos Algara, a professor of
political science at Claremont Graduate University.

On the two occasions since 1934 when that near law of physics has been
broken, the president in office had job-approval ratings above 60
percent. In 1962, John F. Kennedy had an approval rating of 61 percent,
and Democrats still lost four House seats, which happens to be exactly
the maximum number of seats Democrats can afford to lose in November
without losing the House and their governing trifecta.

[So [even with]{.mark} the modest [good news]{.mark}
[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} have been given in the redistricting
process, they [will need **a lot more**]{.mark} than a "bump" in Biden's
approval ratings [to overcome history and logic]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Yes, stabilizing and marginally improving Biden's popularity can place a
floor on Democratic losses and perhaps (with some luck and a lot of
Trump-fueled Republican stumbling) even save the Senate. But [[the blunt
truth is that]{.mark} barring a dazzlingly successful Biden
presidency]{.underline} --- one that extends his popularity beyond his
party deep into the ranks of independents and even Republicans ---
[**[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s have already lost]{.mark}**. They sealed their
fate in November 2020 when they carried the House by such a surprisingly
small margin. [Nothing Biden has done]{.mark} right or wrong since then
[has changed that fundamental reality]{.mark}]{.underline}.

## AFF LINK

### No link -- Ukraine/NATO not a winner

#### Biden isn't winning on Ukraine -- voters don't think diplomatic maneuvers like NATO cooperation are realistic 

John T. **Bennett April 11**, 2022, "America is the Ghostbusters of
Western affairs. Voters know it and want more from Biden," ROLL CALL,
https://rollcall.com/2022/04/12/america-is-the-ghostbusters-of-western-affairs-voters-know-it-and-want-more-from-biden/

President Joe [Biden is]{.underline} hitting the road this week --- and
[facing a challenge to convince voters why they should keep Democrats in
control of Congress]{.underline}.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has predicted Democrats will not only
keep their narrow House majority but expand it. Some Senate Democrats
and outside strategists have suggested they see reasons why the party
might maintain its paper-thin Senate edge.

But those forecasts break with the projections of most political
analysts, who are projecting Republicans will likely take control of the
House and possibly the Senate come January. That means congressional
[Democrats have a steep uphill climb]{.underline} between Easter and
November's midterm elections.

First-term presidents typically lose seats in their first congressional
elections --- and, sometimes, as then-President Barack Obama put it in
2010, their party suffers a "shellacking." The RealClearPolitics polling
average for the "generic ballot" question of whom voters prefer gives
the GOP an edge.

A major problem for Democrats is Biden, partly due to his own missteps
and partly due to factors beyond his control, lacks any real coattails.
Some Democratic incumbents and candidates are campaigning with more than
a little daylight between themselves and POTUS.

Biden's approval rating in the regular CBS News-YouGov survey hit the
lowest mark for that survey since he started his job: 42 percent. That's
down from 50 percent in August and 62 percent in March 2021, according
to the same survey.

But that overall approval number fails to paint the whole picture, and
it's not a pretty one for Biden and his fellow Democrats.

Consider the president's disapproval ratings on kitchen table issues
like his handling of the economy, rising consumer prices and increased
gas prices. The number of Americans dissatisfied with his performance on
things that impact their wallets every single day typically clocks in no
lower than 55 percent in the CBS-YouGov poll --- and on many issues, the
figure hovers around a whopping 70 percent.

Biden will stop in Iowa and North Carolina this week to deliver remarks
on how his administration is implementing the bipartisan infrastructure
law, addressing record inflation and trying to pare high gasoline
prices. Former President Donald Trump easily won Iowa and narrowly took
North Carolina in the 2020 presidential election.

White House officials and Biden confidants say the president will be
active on the midterm campaign trail and express confidence Democrats
have accomplishments to tout this year, but it is unclear if that will
move voters to their column.

'Just got to tell it'

Barack Obama, visiting the White House last week for the first time
since leaving office in January 2017, told reporters that Democratic
candidates should do this during the heart of the midterm campaign
season: "You've got a story to tell --- just got to tell it."

But do voters want to hear it?

Sixty-three percent of those surveyed in that latest CBS-YouGov poll
said they disapprove of Biden's handling of the economy. On inflation,
69 percent are dissatisfied. And more than 60 percent of those polled
expressed disapproval with Biden's handling of immigration and crime.

[Biden]{.underline} also [is **underwater** on his handling of Russia's
military invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, though his 55 percent
disapproval level against 45 percent approval more closely reflects a
country split into two political camps.

Much of this era of Biden-Democratic control, following a strong start
combating the COVID-19 pandemic, has come with a
damned-if-they-do-damned-if-they-don't feel.

For instance, conservative media outlets both describe Biden as a
doddering, feckless 79-year-old figurehead who cannot speak coherently
--- and the mastermind of a liberal attempt to throw open the country's
borders while creating a socialist megastate.

Voters get in on the act, too. Biden's scrapped "Build Back Better"
domestic spending plan, as a whole, was unpopular with voters --- but
individual parts, when brought up separately by pollsters, got
relatively good marks.

[There]{.underline} also [is a mounting feel of a **snakebitten
president**]{.underline}. On several days when Biden was slated to
deliver remarks on his administration's agenda or perceived
accomplishments, tragedies have overshadowed his message. It happened
again on Tuesday: Before his Iowa remarks on his team's economic
efforts, a man launched an attack in Brooklyn in New York City that left
at least 16 shot or injured in the subway system.

Troublingly for him and other Democrats, voters are not just siding with
Republican arguments on domestic matters. [New polling shows voters are
**siding with Republicans** on how to handle the Russia-Ukraine
war]{.underline}.

Administration officials say they have slapped sanctions, trade and
other economic penalties on the Russian government, companies and
individuals in an "unprecedented" way. They also tout hundreds of
millions of dollars in military weaponry and other aid Washington has
sent to Ukrainians.

But [pollsters are being told by GOP and Democratic voters one clear
thing: Biden has not done enough, nor quickly enough]{.underline}.

Like GOP senators and House members, the new CBS-YouGov poll shows 75
percent of Americans want to get Ukrainians more weapons --- and much
faster.

The same is true about sanctions. Seventy-four percent said U.S.
sanctions on Russia should be increased.

'We should ship it'

Like on domestic issues, with a deadly and sometimes-barbaric war raging
in Europe, [Republicans have an edge. They are]{.underline}, in short,
[winning the messaging battle]{.underline}.

"We know who the Ukrainians are. They're freedom fighters. We know who
Putin is. He bombs women and children," Senate Intelligence Committee
member Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said last week, before turning to pleas from
Ukraine's president: "We're a superpower and \[Volodymyr\] Zelenskyy
challenged us to act like it. Zelensky needs more."

Sasse then spoke for nearly three-quarters of Americans, adding this
about various missile systems and remotely piloted aircraft: "If it
shoots, we should ship it. More S-300s, more Javelins, more drones, more
Stingers, more everything."

After four years of a Trump administration that was chock full of
officials with little or no government experience, Biden has made good
on his campaign trail promise to fill his with experienced technocrats.
They respect policy-making in a way the Trump disrupters and dismantlers
admitted they didn't. Team Biden is methodical, measured and all about
inter-agency task forces, whole-of-government approaches and cumbersome
processes to produce policy options to Biden.

Voters, however, are hungry for action. On inflation, on gas prices, on
COVID-19 and on Russia's brutal war.

"This administration is constantly giving process answers," a frustrated
Sasse told reporters. "The administration talks about this (Ukraine)
like it's somehow some nerd lawyer discussion, not like it's a moral
battle between good guys and bad guys, and we need the good guys to
win."

[Biden administration officials also curiously describe some
**diplomatic process that seem detached from reality**]{.underline}. An
example came Sunday, when national security adviser Jake Sullivan was
asked about European allies giving Ukraine Soviet-era fighter jets on
which their pilots are trained.

### No link -- Dems won't run on it

#### Dems won't run on the plan -- the strategy is to focus on domestic issues

focus from Ukraine war to kitchen table issues at home as midterms
loom," CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/09/politics/biden-domestic-issues-ukraine-war/index.html

[[Since Biden returned from]{.mark} a last-minute diplomatic outing to
[Europe]{.mark} last month, [he\'s held **no**]{.mark} **scheduled
[events]{.mark}** [about Russia]{.mark}\'s invasion]{.underline} \-- a
stark contrast to the previous weeks, when the President emerged
regularly to update Americans on new sanctions, intelligence and Western
military assistance.

Even as the atrocities of Bucha played out on television screens across
the world this week --- including in the West Wing, where an outraged
Biden and his team watched with horror --- there were no specific events
to address the grim footage.

[[Instead]{.mark}, Biden\'s [focus has been **squarely at
home**]{.mark}. [From]{.mark} the cost of **[health care]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} **supply chain [bottlenecks]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[prices
at the pump]{.mark}** and a robust **economic recovery**]{.underline}
--- one that officials believe simply hasn\'t broken through ---
[[Biden\'s]{.mark} public focus has lately been [guided **entirely by
domestic issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The shift comes as Biden and his team assess a concerning political
landscape complicated by the ripple effect of severe economic sanctions
imposed on Moscow. [Other recent developments]{.underline} \--
[including]{.underline} a decision to lift pandemic-era restrictions on
[the **border**]{.underline} \-- [have contributed to growing unease
among Democrats about November\'s elections. And]{.underline} a recent
surge of **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 cases among Biden\'s circle has
[acted as a reminder of the virus\' continued presence]{.underline}.

[[Biden\'s response to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine has **done little**
to boost]{.mark} his [sagging political standing]{.mark}]{.underline},
despite generating unprecedented unity among Western allies. As the
White House settles in for what officials believe will be a prolonged
conflict, there has been a clear effort to try and break through
wall-to-wall war coverage with Biden\'s domestic priorities.

\"We can do more than one thing at a time,\" a senior administration
official told CNN. \"[We have a story to tell at home and it\'s only
natural that we would focus on that as much as possible]{.underline}.\"

steering the 2022 midterm elections, WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2022/big-picture-2022-midterms/

[Every election has a story.]{.underline}

In 2010, the story was an angry tea party movement and a rebellion
against President Barack Obama's newly enacted Affordable Care Act. In
2018, it was a backlash, fueled by the energy and fury of suburban
women, against the chaotic governing style and misogynistic belligerence
of President Donald Trump.

The stories of some elections are often clearer in retrospect than they
are in the moment, but there were blinking lights throughout 2010 and
2018 that the party in control of the White House was heading for
trouble. **[The same can be said for 2022]{.underline}**. [President
Biden's approval ratings are in the danger zone, putting the Democrats'
slender majorities in the House and Senate in jeopardy. Many Democratic
leaders are already braced, at a minimum, to lose control of the
House.]{.underline}

Political volatility has become commonplace in a nation as deeply and
closely divided as America today. Seven of the last eight elections
qualify as change elections --- a shift in the balance in some important
way. And, if Republicans were to capture the House and Senate in
November, Biden would become the fifth consecutive president to see his
party lose both chambers of Congress on his watch.

But other than Democratic nervousness, what is the story of this year?
**[What is motivating voters?]{.underline}** What forces are steering
the election, other than the tides of history?

[Analysts point to a nation weary]{.underline} at a time in which there
seems no escape from disorder, [whether it be]{.underline} the long bout
with the **[coronavirus]{.underline}** or **[soaring prices or rising
crime rates]{.underline}** in cities **[or]{.underline}** surging
crossings of undocumented **[immigrants]{.underline}** at the southern
border. Added to all of that is the brutal war of aggression in Ukraine
launched without provocation by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a
conflict that is redrawing the international order.

"[This is a country that is **exhausted from politics**]{.underline},"
said Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik, who served in the Clinton
administration. "[It's exhausted from covid. It's exhausted from
uncertainty. It's exhausted from inflation]{.underline}. [It's exhausted
from the world unraveling]{.underline}. [That's not great when you're in
charge]{.underline}. But the second factor is disappointment. There was
a notion that with Biden taking office we were going to come back to a
sense of normalcy in the world."

"[Independent voters decide elections]{.underline},\" said Richard
Czuba, a Michigan-based analyst. \"Right now \[in Michigan\] [they are
really worried about **inflation**]{.underline} --- [and it's not just
gas prices]{.underline}. [You talk to people in focus groups and they
will talk about milk and bread and cereal. They understand that gas
prices have soared because of the war in Ukraine, but that's not the
case for food]{.underline}."

### Link turn -- NATO rallies GOP

#### Plan gives midterm candidates something to campaign against -- Trump turned the GOP against NATO

Lisa **Mascaro May 16**, 2022, AP Congressional Correspondent, "With
echoes of Trump, GOP splinters over \$40B for Ukraine," KILLEEN DAILY
HERALD,
https://kdhnews.com/news/politics/with-echoes-of-trump-gop-splinters-over-40b-for-ukraine/article_799d457f-8c29-528f-a39c-3ba6b54f8d61.html

[[Signs]{.mark} of Republican resistance [are mounting over]{.mark} a
\$40 billion aid package to Ukraine, [a reemergence of the]{.mark}
**Trump-led [isolationist]{.mark} wing of the [GOP]{.mark}** that\'s
coming at a crucial moment as the war against the Russian invasion
deepens]{.underline}.

The Senate voted late Monday to advance the Ukraine aid bill 81-11,
pushing it toward President Joe Biden\'s desk by week\'s end to become
law. But more [vocal objections from Republicans in Congress are sending
warning signs after what has been rare and united support for Ukraine as
it desperately battles hostile Russia]{.underline}. All 11 no votes came
from Republican senators.

It comes as Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell led a delegation of
GOP senators to visit the region over the weekend in a show of support,
vowing to push past detractors, finish up the aid package and vote this
summer on expanding NATO to welcome Sweden and Finland. The leader finds
himself holding down the GOP\'s more traditional foreign policy
approach, in direct confrontation with the GOP\'s \"America First\"
flank, including Donald Trump, the former president.

"There's always been isolationist voices in the Republican Party,"
McConnell told reporters on a conference call over the weekend from
Stockholm. "It won't create a problem, we'll get the job done.\"

The shift in Congress opens a new political phase in Ukraine's fight for
its survival against the Russian invasion, offering a wake-up call for
the Biden administration about its strategy as it resists direct U.S.
military troop involvement and depends on votes in the House and Senate
to fund the military and humanitarian relief effort.

[While a strong bipartisan majority is poised to approve the latest
round of Ukraine aid, bringing the U.S. total to \$53 billion since the
start of Russia's invasion, it's clear that]{.underline}
[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark}, and some Democrats, [[are **wary
of**]{.mark} **a prolonged [intervention]{.mark}** and demanding a more
fulsome accounting of the U.S. role overseas. While the House
overwhelmingly approved the \$40 billion package last week, 57
Republicans voted against it]{.underline}.

[The most vocal [lawmakers are insisting Congress will not become a
**blank check** for overseas action]{.mark} amid domestic needs as they
move away from the U.S.\'s longstanding role of championing democracy
abroad]{.underline}.

"We have got to take care of things here at home first," said Republican
Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, the former Trump administration's
ambassador to Japan, on Fox\'s "Sunday Morning Futures."

Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri tweeted of his no vote: "That's
not isolationism. That's nationalism."

It's stronger pushback than just a few months ago, at the start of war
in February, when Congress made a rare show of bipartisan unity against
Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion and rushed to Ukraine's aid.

[And it comes as **[the midterm]{.mark} election [season is
underway]{.mark}** in the U.S., with [Trump's]{.mark} influence [looming
large]{.mark}, particularly [with]{.mark} Republican [lawmakers
desperate for his]{.mark} campaign [endorsements and support]{.mark} and
afraid to go against him]{.underline}.

"We have a moral obligation to pass this aid as soon as we can," Senate
Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday ahead of the
procedural vote.

[[Trump]{.mark} weighed in, breaking the civic norm in the U.S. that
former presidents traditionally step aside to allow one president at a
time to lead, particularly on foreign policy]{.underline}.

[The former president, whose "America First" strategy [sought to **pull
back** from]{.mark} U.S. commitments around the world and criticized the
[NATO]{.mark} military alliance confronting Russia]{.underline},
complained that Democrats are "sending another \$40 billion to Ukraine,
yet America's parents are struggling to even feed their children."

Trump had been impeached by the House in 2019 after he withheld military
aid to Ukraine and pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for a favor
digging up dirt on Biden ahead of the U.S. presidential election, though
he was later acquitted by the Senate.

[[On the campaign trail]{.mark} in Ohio, the U.S. Senate
[candidates]{.mark}, Democrat Tim Ryan and Trump-backed Republican JD
Vance, [have been **brawling** over]{.mark} the Ukraine

#### GOP will rally against NATO to maintain perception of hardline

Ashley **Parker**, Marianna **Sotomayor and** Isaac **Stanley-Becker
April 29**, 2022, "Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the
NATO alliance," THE WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

In early 2019, several months after President Donald [[Trump threatened
to upend]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[T]{.mark}**reaty **[O]{.mark}**rganization]{.underline} during a trip
to Brussels for the alliance's annual summit, House lawmakers passed the
NATO Support Act amid overwhelming bipartisan support, with only 22
Republicans voting against the measure.

But [this month, when a similar bill in support of NATO during the
Russian invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark} again faced a vote in the House,
the support was far more polarized, with 63 Republicans --- 30 percent
of the party's conference --- voting against it]{.underline}.

[The vote [underscores the Republican]{.mark} Party's remarkable
**[drift away from NATO]{.mark}** in recent years, as positions once
considered part of a libertarian fringe have become doctrine for a
growing portion of the party]{.underline}.

The [[isolationist]{.underline}]{.mark} posture of some
[[Republicans]{.underline}]{.mark} is in line [[with the]{.mark}
"America First" [ethos of Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}, the GOP's de facto
leader, who has long **[[railed against NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Last week, speaking at a Heritage Foundation event in Florida, Trump
implied that as president he had threatened not to defend NATO allies
from Russian attacks as a negotiating tactic to pressure them to
contribute more money toward the organization's shared defense.

The vote also comes against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has [**[catapulted NATO]{.mark}**
to its most prominent role in decades. [And]{.mark} it comes as some
[**hawkish Republicans** seek to cast themselves as]{.mark} stronger
[opponents]{.mark} of Russia than Democrats]{.underline}.

#### GOP is swayed by Trump's anti-NATO sentiment

Zachary B. **Wolf February 24**, 2022, "Analysis: Will the GOP follow
Trump on Russia?" THE PRESS-ENTERPRISE,
https://www.pe.com/2022/02/23/analysis-will-the-gop-follow-trump-on-russia/

**[[The GOP]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [already changed by Trump, may be
molting again]{.underline}.

The old party. Republicans used to stand up to Russia. During the Cold
War, President Ronald Reagan demanded that Soviet General Secretary
Mikhail Gorbachev "tear down this wall" in Berlin.

They used to oppose unwarranted invasions. In 1990, George H.W. Bush
said to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein that his aggression against Kuwait
"will not stand."

They used to recognize that even modern Russia is a threat to the US.
Mitt Romney --- who became the Republican presidential nominee in the
2012 race against President Barack Obama --- said that year that Russia
was the United States' main geopolitical foe.

A new tone. [The party today **[is under the influence of
Trump]{.mark}**, who heaped admiration on Putin for invading another
country with a democratically elected leader]{.underline}.

"I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said,
'This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine, of
Ukraine, Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that's wonderful," Trump
said on Tuesday in an interview on "The Clay Travis & Buck Sexton Show,"
a conservative radio show.

He then suggested it would be nice to have a "peace force" like the
Russian military to be stationed on the US border with Mexico --- a
supremely flawed comparison since Trump wants to secure the border,
whereas Putin appears to be set on claiming new territory. Putin has
misleadingly referred to Russian forces he ordered to enter eastern
Ukraine as "peacekeepers."

Holdouts. It was Republicans like Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam
Kinzinger of Illinois, the few seeking accountability for the Capitol
Hill insurrection, who openly criticized Trump's praise of Putin.

Others' praise for Putin. Before the Ukraine invasion, there were
already echoes of Trump's high regard for Putin among Republicans.

Trump's secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, called Putin "a very talented
statesman" who has "lots of gifts" in a Fox interview. The Kansas City
Star wrote in detail about Pompeo's comments regarding Putin and Ukraine
over the years.

Disinterest in other democracies. After the invasion of Ukraine began,
there was a lot of disinterest from conservative voices.

"As an American, what's in this for me and my neighbors and the rest of
us? And all I'm getting is that we can feel morally satisfied because we
hate Putin," Tucker Carlson said on Fox on Tuesday.

J.D. Vance, an author and Trump acolyte running for Senate in Ohio, has
pushed an almost isolationist view of foreign policy, arguing the US has
no real interest in Russia's incursion into Ukraine and should instead
be focused solely on the Southern border.

"'America First' means not listening to the same people who have
blundered us into disaster after disaster on the world stage," Vance
said on Twitter on Wednesday.

Coincidental alignment. Even Republicans who talk about the need to
support Ukraine have suggested the US might reject out of hand, as Putin
desires, admitting Ukraine into NATO.

Sen. Josh Hawley, the fist-pumping Missourian who helped question the US
presidential election results, recently wrote a letter to Secretary of
State Antony Blinken questioning the wisdom of even entertaining the
idea of adding Ukraine to NATO.

It just so happens that Putin's main goal of halting the expansion of
NATO is exactly in line with Hawley's letter.

An authoritarian and a wannabe authoritarian. Trump's reverence of Putin
is well documented, as are Putin's efforts to meddle in recent US
presidential elections with an eye toward helping Trump's chances.

Putin has won elections with unbelievable support. Trump is still won't
believe he lost the 2020 election. Both men may be running again in
2024.

In fact, their interests have often dovetailed.

Putin wants to beat NATO back to its Cold War membership and undermine
European unity.

[**[Trump groused about NATO throughout his presidency]{.underline}**,
[and frequently misrepresented]{.underline}]{.mark} [[NATO]{.mark}'s
requirement that member nations spend 2% of their GDP on defense. He
moved to pull US troops from Germany, which drew warnings from people
like Romney, although NATO officials tried to put a positive spin on the
move]{.underline}.

#### NATO can be weaponized by the GOP

Ashley **Parker**, Marianna **Sotomayor and** Isaac **Stanley-Becker
April 29**, 2022, "Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the
NATO alliance," THE WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

Another sign of the party's isolationist wing emerged Thursday, as the
House passed an update to a World War II-era military bill creating a
lend-lease program intended to make it easier for the United States to
supply Ukraine with military aid. Only 10 lawmakers --- all Republicans
--- voted against the measure.

In an exchange earlier in the week between Secretary of State Antony
Blinken, who was testifying before Congress, and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.),
Paul pushed back on Blinken's assertion that over the years Russia has
shown a willingness to attack countries like Georgia that are not part
of NATO, while giving wider berth to countries that are members of the
alliance.

"You could also argue the countries they've attacked were part of
Russia, or were part of the Soviet Union," said Paul, who was one of
just two senators who voted against a 2018 bill reaffirming support for
a NATO, in what was at the time a pointed rebuke of Trump.

"Yes, and I firmly disagree with that proposition," Blinken responded.

[For some foreign policy experts and international allies,
**[the]{.mark} mere [fact]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} nearly [one-third of
the Republican conference voted against]{.mark} a bill that
fundamentally seeks to support both [NATO]{.mark} and Ukraine
[highlights]{.mark} **a [marked]{.mark} foreign policy
[evolution]{.mark} in the Republican Party**]{.underline}.

"We now are really seeing the true impact of deep, deep political
polarization, where it is better to harm the other side than do what's
right for the country," said Heather Conley, president of the German
Marshall Fund. "This deep domestic polarization has now crept into
foreign and security policy. [There has always been strong bipartisan
support for [NATO]{.mark}, but everything now [has become polarized and
can be weaponized]{.mark} against the other side, even if it supports
U.S. national security interests]{.underline}."

## AFF IMPACT

### GOP too fractured to solve an impact

#### Internal divisions stall any GOP agenda even if they retake Congress

Anthony **Zurcher May 3**, 2022, "Midterms 2022: What will Republicans
do if they win Congress?" BBC,
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61280069

This year, [the Republican Party leadership seems to have settled
on]{.underline} a similar path. That means [focusing]{.underline} its
messaging on [dissatisfaction with]{.underline} President Joe
[Biden]{.underline} and the Democrats, [rather than advancing a
particular governing agenda]{.underline}.

What will that mean if they do win in November?

Confusion all around

When asked in January what his party would do if it regained control of
Congress next year, Senator Mitch McConnell - who would in all
likelihood run the chamber if Republicans prevail - was coy.

\"That is a very good question,\" he said. \"And I\'ll let you know when
we take it back\".

In the House, it\'s a similar problem. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
has set up a taskforce to come up with a campaign agenda - something
easier said than done. When it was attempted prior to the party\'s
national convention in 2020, Republicans were unable to agree on an
electoral platform - the US political equivalent of a British party
manifesto. The platform for the re-election of Donald Trump was instead
simply a renewal of the 2016 document, even with its dated references to
Barack Obama and the \"failed\" incumbent president.

The apparent lack of focus is being felt by the rank-and-file voters
whose enthusiasm the party will need in November.

At the February Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC, a
gathering of right-wing activists and politicians in Florida, more than
one attendee was unimpressed.

\"I come to CPAC, and I hear a lot of blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,\"
said Florida resident Bernita Gigowski. \"And I just want to yell out,
\'but you\'ve been in office for 10 or 12 years and what have you
done?\'\"

\"[The Republican Party is currently going through some growing
pains]{.underline},\" said Daniel Hopping, a college student attending
the conference.

The [lack of a cohesive]{.underline} Republican [platform
is]{.underline}, in part, [a reflection of the changes the party has
undergone since]{.underline} Mr [Trump won]{.underline} the presidency
in 2016, said Mr Hopping.

\"We\'re becoming more of a populist, limited-government,
culturally-sound party rather than just, \'let\'s just cut taxes and
have a nice trade deal or something.\'\"

As was the case for the Democrats during the Trump years, [a common foe
can help cover obscure intra-party fault lines]{.underline}.

[Among Republicans, the divides between the party\'s big-business,
corporate interests, the Christian evangelicals and the white
working-class voters who flocked to Mr Trump\'s America-First rhetoric
have been smoothed over but still run deep]{.underline}.

But that temporary [unity is fragile, and comes with risks]{.underline}.

After Republicans won the Senate and held the House of Representatives
in 2014, dissatisfaction among rank-and-file voters - particularly on
issues such as trade and immigration - may have contributed to the
success of Donald Trump\'s anti-establishment presidential campaign.
Those divides haven\'t entirely vanished, and **[if Republicans take
power next year]{.underline}**, [acrimony over the direction of the
party on social issues, trade, foreign policy and immigration could
re-emerge]{.underline}.

### Impact turn -- GOP bad -- Democracy

#### Red wave kills U.S. democracy

Jena **Griswold '21,** October 4, 2021, chair of the Democratic
Association of Secretaries of State and Colorado secretary of state, as
interviewed by Jeremy Stahl, "The 2022 Races That Could Determine if

[**[2022 is going to have a huge impact on democracy]{.mark}**, because
we are seeing the Big Lie proponents running to become secretary of
state. **[In every swing state]{.mark}** that has a secretary of state
race, [there is an extreme Republican]{.mark} candidate [that was either
at the insurrection]{.mark}, [an author of voter suppression, or an
advocate of the Big Lie]{.mark}]{.underline}. That includes Mark
Finchem. You also have in Arizona, Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who was an
author of \[a\] voter suppression \[bill\]. It includes in Georgia,
where Congressman Jody Hice voted against certifying the 2020 electoral
college results and has repeatedly claimed that the elections in Georgia
were rife with irregularities. You have Kristina Karamo in Michigan, who
falsely claimed former President Trump won Michigan and spent weeks
challenging election results. She also, by the way, visited Arizona to
see the partisan election review. Then you have Jim Marchant in Nevada,
who basically alleged voter fraud in his own congressional loss when he
lost by 5 points. And here in Colorado, I'm running against a person who
again is spreading the Big Lie.

President Trump recently endorsed multiple Republican candidates for
secretary of state who have been spreading the Big Lie. And he keeps
making it clear that he's making disavowing facts and election results a
litmus test to an endorsement. And that's why [the [2022]{.mark}
election [is]{.mark} going to be]{.underline} so
[[important]{.underline}]{.mark}. Voters will get to choose who they
want to oversee the elections. **[[Democracy is literally]{.mark} going
to be [on the ballot]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

It may, in other words, be short-lived simply because the uprising will
probably not be based upon the decisions of constituent states (which,
in the US Civil War, created a break-away confederacy), acting within
their own perception of a legal process. It is more probable that [the

The outcome, to a degree dependent on how rapidly order is restored,
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely [be the **[end]{.mark}**, or
constraint, of the present view of **[democracy in the

[[GOP control]{.mark} of the House]{.underline} --- with the now-50-50
Senate very much up for grabs --- would end the ambitious pieces of
Biden's agenda, but it also [[flashes danger for the 2024 POTUS]{.mark}
election, regardless of whether the Former Guy or someone else is the
Republican nominee]{.underline}. In 2020, Team [[Trump's]{.mark}
half-baked [schemes to overturn Biden's victory]{.mark}]{.underline}
were easily shot down by judges or state election officials, but in
hindsight this [[may have been a trial run for 2024]{.mark} and making
their plan work, **[even if Biden or his successor gets the most
votes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In [Georgia]{.underline}, for example, the most troubling provision in
that voter suppression bill that Gov. Brian Kemp signed under a painting
of a former slave plantation [gives the state's GOP-led General Assembly
effective power over the State Board of Elections and also would allow
the state board to take over local county boards in places such as
Democratic-controlled Atlanta. Other proposed bills would give state
lawmakers powers that they lacked in 2020, to more aggressively probe
fraud allegations and possibly certify winners]{.underline}.

"So [[what happens in 2024 if]{.underline}]{.mark} President [Biden
or]{.underline} Vice President [Harris win the Electoral College, but
local [Republicans on county boards with majority Democratic votes
refuse to certify the election]{.mark}]{.underline}," writes David
Atkins in Washington Monthly, or "when state legislatures who have
seized control of certification refuse to certify their state tallies;
when a potential Republican majority in the House of Representatives
refuses to certify the Electoral College tally?"

Good questions. When [Trump supporters]{.underline} who [invested
heavily in the]{.underline} Big Lie about 2020's election outcome saw
their fantasies [[collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}, it resulted
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the January 6 insurrection on Capitol Hill,
where five people died, along with some [faith in [the **stability of
U.S. democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So how will the other side react
in 2024 if an election is actually stolen from the rightful winner?
While Democrats are trying to tackle a crisis in real time, [Republicans
are playing a long game]{.underline} from Phoenix to D.C., [with the

[[A base for 2024]{.mark}: [Successful midterm elections can become a
**platform**]{.mark} to prepare [for a successful run against the
president in his reelection bid]{.mark}. In 1966, for instance,
Republicans gained seats in the midterm]{.underline} elections even
though Democrats retained control of the House and Senate (which, other
than when the Republicans controlled the Senate from 1981 to 1987, the
Democrats held from 1955 to 1995). Teaming up with southern Democrats,
in 1967 and 1968, [Republicans put pressure on President Lyndon B.
Johnson to cut Great Society spending and to deal with the inflationary
effects of the war in Vietnam, all of which helped Richard Nixon win
office in 1968.]{.underline}

To be sure, strong midterm performances don\'t always have this effect.
Though Democrats were devastated when the GOP took control of Congress
in 1994, President Clinton was able to decisively defeat Senator Robert
Dole in 1996.

[[In 2023, Republican control of the House or Senate would]{.mark}
likely **[help the GOP]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Republican senators
hoping to run for the White House in 2024 would have new opportunities
for national attention. A Republican House or Senate could shift
attention toward questions that would benefit possible candidates who
are currently serving as governors. [And [given]{.mark} the [close
alignment of Congressional Republicans to]{.mark} former President
**[Trump]{.mark}**, [this would clearly **boost his chances** for
reelection]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Trump in '24 collapses the economy and causes China war

Damon **Linker '21**, August 3, "Trump 2024 could be American
democracy\'s zero hour," THE WEEK,
https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1003257/trump-2024-stop-the-steal

Let\'s begin at the beginning: [[Is Trump going to run again? No one can
know for sure, but it\'s]{.mark} looking [likely]{.mark}]{.underline}.
For one thing, because he\'s nursing grudges and he wants revenge. For
another, because he\'s under legal threat from various investigations,
and if he were to win, he would likely be immunized from punishment
until he left office. Then there is his insatiable craving for
attention. He received inhuman amounts of it while living in the White
House, which means he\'s been enduring painful withdrawal ever since. In
this respect, the continued social media ban on Trump could be
increasing the likelihood that he\'ll run again, since he\'s incapable
of hogging the spotlight in any other way.

But won\'t Trump have to compete against other Republicans for the GOP
nomination? Not really. In addition to him holding commanding leads over
potential rivals in every survey of Republican voters, there is the
unreality of all such polls. It might be interesting to see that Florida
Gov. Ron DeSantis polls best against Trump in a large field. But would
DeSantis actually run against Trump in the primaries? Make a compelling
case about why voters should prefer him over Trump? I find that hard to
imagine, since it would be guaranteed to provoke a furious salvo of
attacks from Trump in defense of himself, which would diminish any rival
in the eyes of most Republican voters. It\'s a no-win scenario. (Which
is why the only Republicans who might seek to challenge Trump are those,
like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney or Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who have no
chance at all of winning the nomination and would be running kamikaze
campaigns designed to take Trump down a peg in the general election.)

So [[Trump is]{.mark} quite likely to run --- and [quite likely to win
the Republican nomination]{.mark} if he does. [What happens
then]{.mark}]{.underline}?

One possibility is that the Democrat wins the general election
decisively --- so decisively that most of the Republicans in Congress
and in red state legislatures currently indulging in absurd conspiracies
about the stolen election of 2020 and the insurrectionary violence of
Jan. 6 are unwilling to go along with an effort to overturn the results.
This would mean Biden, Harris, or whichever Democrat ends up running
would have to win swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin,
Arizona, and Georgia by a couple of percentage points. (The national
popular-vote margin will be irrelevant.) In such a situation, the
procedures of democratic transition would probably unfold without major
incident, no matter how much of a stink Trump tried to make.

Then there\'s the (unlikely) possibility of Trump solidly defeating his
general election opponent. This is improbable because Trump has never
won more than 46.9 percent of the vote, and his refusal to accept the
results of the last election and incitement of his supporters on Jan. 6
alienated some Republicans and a good number of independents. Trump may
be able to win the GOP primaries in a walk, but bettering his 2020
showing in the general election of 2024 will be quite difficult. That
is, unless some other event or series of them intervene to severely
discredit the Democrats. Like what? [[Think]{.mark} runaway inflation or
other evidence of a **[sharp economic downturn]{.mark}**, continued
growth in violent crime, [and]{.mark}/or the outbreak of **[war with
China]{.mark}** over an attempted invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.

Koppelman underscored what we should all be clear about by now: that
[most of the Republican Party publicly touts the lie that]{.underline}
Donald [Trump won the 2020 election]{.underline} but that the vote was
rigged and victory stolen from him. [The [Republican]{.mark} elected

Sean Spicer, Trump's former press secretary, said that [[the

for the presidency]{.underline} after watching current President Joe
Biden's response to a variety of issues, including immigration.

**["[He's in]{.mark},"]{.underline}** Spicer told the Washington
Examiner in an interview for his upcoming book, "Radical Nation: Joe
Biden and Kamala Harris's Dangerous Plan for America."

The former press secretary, however, added that Trump may be less
interested to run in 2024 if the GOP secures the House and Senate in
2022. "There needs to be something that will keep him out," Spicer
added.

The Examiner has not explicitly stated whether Spicer is giving his
opinion or whether he has spoken to the former president or a person
with knowledge of Trump's 2024 plans.

Spicer's remarks come after RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said [[Trump

#### GOP winning midterms propels Trump, risking total breakdown of democracy

democracy\'s zero hour," THE WEEK,
https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1003257/trump-2024-stop-the-steal

[The real danger would arise in a situation where Trump lost by a narrow
margin, setting up a redo of the post-2020 election effort to \"stop the
steal\" --- especially [if the GOP has taken control of]{.mark} both
houses of Congress (as seems likely) in the intervening **[2022]{.mark}
midterm election**]{.underline}. One possibility is that the Democrat
prevails by winning a small number of [[states]{.underline}]{.mark} that
are [[controlled by Republican legislatures]{.mark} and those elected
officials reject the results, [pronouncing Trump the winner]{.mark}
instead]{.underline}. [This [would]{.mark} then [be followed by a
Republican-controlled Congress certifying those results]{.mark} on Jan.
6, 2024]{.underline}. That\'s the scenario that many Democrats already
worry quite a lot about.

But another series of events could be more likely.

[Imagine]{.underline} that [things are]{.underline} much [less
clear-cut]{.underline} than an outright steal by the Republicans.
Imagine, instead, that Trump goads some legislatures to try for a steal,
but others balk, prompting armed protests at state capitals.
[Conservative media outlets]{.underline} also [fracture]{.underline},
with some opposing Trump\'s moves but others cheering them on as the
only thing standing in the way of the progressive imposition of a
\"theocratic oligarchy.\"

Many [[Republicans in Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, [[think
Trump is full of it, but they\'ve gone so far in endorsing his
lies]{.mark} about election fraud going back to 2020, [and]{.mark} in
**[whipping up hysteria]{.mark}** about the existential threat posed by
the left, that they feel boxed in]{.underline}. The growing protests in
Washington and around the country, organized by the militia movement,
scare them. But so do the protests encouraged by the left in cities
across the nation. Trump would be insisting that any outcome that
doesn\'t deliver the White House to him should be considered
illegitimate, while Democrats claim the same thing about any outcome
that doesn\'t keep the White House in their hands.

In such a situation, [[we could end up with]{.underline}]{.mark} more
than one slate of electors, with none of them adding up to 270. More
than [a **[constitutional crisis]{.mark}**, this would be a legitimacy
crisis that would raise the very serious prospect of **[full-blown
democratic procedural breakdown]{.mark}**, with no person or institution
possessing the requisite authority and trust to swoop in and settle the
burgeoning dispute]{.underline}.

How likely is it that this exact series of events unfolds in precisely
this way? Not very. Contingencies we can\'t imagine today will
undoubtedly intervene and quite possibly send events down a path we
can\'t yet anticipate. Or else one of the less dangerous options
sketched above will transpire.

But [the very fact that **[Trump running again]{.mark}** for the
presidency [could set in motion a series of events that brings American
**democracy to the brink**]{.mark} is something that everyone should be
pondering and preparing for as we approach our country\'s next civic
reckoning]{.underline}.

### A2 turns the case

#### Europe and the GOP could work together

Ashley **Parker**, Marianna **Sotomayor and** Isaac **Stanley-Becker
April 29**, 2022, "Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the
NATO alliance," THE WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

But [[Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark} who were heartened by the outcome
of the last American election are beginning to eye upcoming contests,
including this year's midterms and the 2024 presidential race. Their
apprehension about a Republican takeover of Congress, which could revive
Trump's brand of foreign policy, is offset by [[hope that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine will strengthen the Republican Party's
internationalist wing and **compel the party to lock arms with
Europe**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"[I'm very concerned about the situation in America]{.underline} --- the
split of the society, the concentration on domestic issues, the
underestimation of the importance of America's international role," said
Thomas de Maizière, a former center-right lawmaker and high-ranking
government minister in Germany who co-chaired a NATO working group
convened in 2020. "[But [there are Republicans we work excellently
with]{.mark}, and I would expect them to take on a larger role [if their
party takes power]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Whether that assessment reflects an accurate reading of Republican
politics is an open question. The answer, however, is existential in
Europe, where the fallout from the war in Ukraine has showcased the
importance of the United States and the limits of aspirations for
European autonomy on matters of technology and defense, according to
lawmakers and diplomats.

Flash points are already coming into view. In 2020, NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg started a working group aimed at strengthening
NATO. The group's final product, "NATO 2030: United for a New Era,"
included proposals, such as the creation of a Center for Democratic
Resilience, that have been scorned by pro-Trump Republicans, including
many of the 63 Republicans who recently voted against the House
resolution affirming support for NATO.

The outcome of that vote surprised even [[Trump's former ambassador to
NATO]{.mark}, Kay Bailey Hutchison, who [argued that]{.mark} the [U.S.
commitment]{.mark} to the alliance [has remained ironclad]{.mark} across
administrations, [despite]{.mark} bellicose
[rhetoric]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"I was nonplussed by that vote," she said in an interview.

A diplomat from a Baltic state, who spoke on the condition of anonymity
to avoid alienating U.S. partners, called the vote a "Trump effect."

"But how many voted for it?" the diplomat added. "[[The mainstream is
**clearly in favor of NATO**]{.mark} **and strengthening
NATO**]{.underline}."

Similarly, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), the co-chair of the Senate NATO
Observer Group, who just returned from a trip to the alliance's
headquarters in Brussels, said the recent [Republican votes against NATO
were "poorly timed," but he dismissed the 63 House Republicans as an
"inconsequential" number]{.underline}.

#### Conservatives want to stop Russia so anti-NATO beliefs are in decline

April 29**, 2022, "Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the
NATO alliance," THE WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

Another European diplomat said [the war in Ukraine has caused European
nations to address some of the complaints leveled by Trump, including
insufficient spending on defense and reliance on Russian oil and
gas]{.underline}. Those were the two issues raised by the former
president when he criticized Stoltenberg at an alliance summit in 2018.

"[It should no longer be a big issue for his supporters]{.underline},"
the diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid
on a sensitive issue.

But for some, the changes are not enough. Rep. Warren Davidson (R-Ohio),
who voted against the recent resolution, said he objected not to NATO
but to its future direction, which in his view places too large a burden
on the United States and involves too much promotion of specific values.

The resolution's affirmation of "unequivocal support" risks being
mistaken for unconditional support, Davidson said. When asked whether he
could envision the United States exiting the alliance --- as Trump
considered with former advisers --- Davidson said the real issue is
rather whether other member nations who are not spending sufficiently on
defense should leave the club.

"Is there a point where America would consider pulling out? It's
something we should discuss," said Davidson, an Army veteran who was
stationed in Germany when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. "The better
question is whether there's a point where we would say to other member
countries, 'This might not be your place --- you're disinvited.'"

Davidson said he objected in particular to the resolution's endorsement
of the Center for Democratic Resilience, which he called an "entity
designed to meddle in other countries' domestic politics."

Disagreements have broken out among member nations over the erosion of
democracy within the alliance, with criticism directed in particular at
Turkey, Hungary and Poland. A Central European diplomat said objections
to the democracy center reflect admiration for the likes of Hungary's
Viktor Orban in other Western nations.

De Maizière echoed that view, saying his primary concern about upcoming
U.S. elections was that "right-wing Republicans are drifting away from
this common path of Western values."

"But I have confidence that you more or less win elections in the middle
in America, not at the extremes," he added. "In the end, perhaps Biden
will lose Congress, but I don't see Trump again as president."

Radoslaw Sikorski, a Polish member of the European Parliament who chairs
the body's delegation for relations with the United States, said Ukraine
"is the second big issue on which Republicans and Democrats agree, after
China."

"[Ukraine has given new credibility to the Atlanticist wing of the
Republican Party]{.underline}, which I find encouraging," said Sikorski,
a member of his country's centrist Civic Platform party and a prominent
critic of the ruling, right-wing Law and Justice party. "[There seems to
be competition in being pro-Ukrainian and wanting to stop
Putin]{.underline}."

[The Biden administration's decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from
Afghanistan]{.underline} by September 11, 2021 [is a **wise strategic
choice**]{.underline} that took significant political courage. The
administration correctly assessed that [perpetuating U.S. military
engagement in Afghanistan has become a **strategic liability** and a
**futile** investment that lost the capacity to alter the basic
political and military dynamics in Afghanistan]{.underline}. That does
not mean that desirable political and security developments will follow
in Afghanistan after the U.S. military withdrawal. Unfortunately, the
possibility of an intensified and potentially highly fragmented and
bloody [civil war is real]{.underline}, and at minimum, the Taliban's
ascendance to formal power will bring painful changes to the country's
political dispensation.

The basic wisdom of the administration's decision is the realization
that perpetuating [U.S. military engagement would not reverse these
dynamics]{.underline} and that [U.S. military, financial, diplomatic,
and leadership resources would be better spent on other
issues]{.underline}. Even so, the administration made some serious
tactical mistakes in its announcement.

#### Turn -- Afghanistan presence trades off with efforts that are more important to U.S. hegemony

The Biden administration's political courage lies in its refusal to be
cowed by the possibility that a terrorism threat will grow in
[Afghanistan]{.underline} after the U.S. withdrawal. That specter has
been a key justification for militarily staying on and on. That
possibility [needs to be weighed against other already materialized
strategic threats and realities]{.underline}. Indeed, another wise
aspect of the Biden administration's decision was to stop treating U.S.
Afghanistan policy in isolation from other issues and strategic
priorities; to date, [the tyranny of sunk costs has inflated
Afghanistan's importance]{.underline}.

Now, [threats from China, an aggressive Russia, North Korea, and Iran
--- as well as zoonotic pandemics --- are more important strategic
priorities. Investing]{.underline} in U.S. Special Operation Forces, top
leadership attention, and financial resources [to counter those threats
can deliver far greater strategic benefits than perpetuating the
Afghanistan military effort]{.underline}.

#### Presence in Afghanistan does not solve terrorism -- only risk of a turn

Actors Co-Director - Africa Security Initiative Senior Fellow - Foreign

The Biden administration correctly assessed that [the threat of
terrorism from Afghanistan today is in fact smaller than from various
parts of Africa and the Middle East]{.underline}. In Somalia, for
example, al-Shabab's territorial and governing power are steadily
increasing and the group retains a strong allegiance to al-Qaida. The
Islamic State (ISIS) in Somalia, while much weaker than al-Shabab,
retains persistent capacity. Various al-Qaida and ISIS affiliates
robustly operate in Mali and other parts of the Sahel and North Africa.
Thus, even though the Taliban is unwilling to sever its connections with
al-Qaida, that threat is not radically different from the terrorist
threats against the United States and our allies emanating from other
locales. Though hopefully the U.S.-Taliban Doha agreement from February
2020 will incentivize the Taliban to prevent al-Qaida from taking
actions against the United States and its allies from Afghanistan, and
ongoing U.S. policy should be geared toward this objectives through
diplomacy, conditional aid and sanctions, and, even, possibly occasional
strikes from off-shore.

Moreover, U.S. veterans of such frustrating [unending wars are an
important source of]{.underline} right-wing armed
[recruitment]{.underline} in the United States and the threat to public
safety, democracy, and rule of law those groups pose here. [By
minimizing]{.underline} such [U.S. military engagements abroad, the
United States is taking a step in addressing this important
danger]{.underline}.

The Biden administration's [political courage lies in]{.underline} its
[refusal to be cowed by the possibility that a terrorism threat will
grow in Afghanistan after the U.S. withdrawal. That specter has been a
key justification for militarily staying on and on]{.underline}. That
possibility needs to be weighed against other already materialized
strategic threats and realities. Indeed, another wise aspect of the
Biden administration's decision was to stop treating U.S. Afghanistan

Now, threats from China, an aggressive Russia, North Korea, and Iran ---
as well as zoonotic pandemics --- are more important strategic
priorities. Investing in U.S. Special Operation Forces, top leadership
attention, and financial resources to counter those threats can deliver
far greater strategic benefits than perpetuating the Afghanistan
military effort.

#### U.S. action in Afghanistan can't solve -- not a basis for hegemonic success

Actors Co-Director - Africa Security Initiative Senior Fellow - Foreign
Policy, Center for Security, Strategy, and Technology, "The US decision

THE HARD GROUND REALITIES IN AFGHANISTAN

[The United States hasn't achieved its goal of defeating the Taliban.
For several years, the Taliban has been steadily ascendant on the
battlefield]{.underline}. It is on a path to become the strongest
political force in Afghanistan, and a powerful actor in a future Afghan
government.

Continuing the [U.S. deployment won't alter this reality. There is no
credible path whereby a sustained U.S. troop presence helps bring a
desirable peace deal]{.underline} --- "desirable" defined as a
Colombia-like deal, with minimal political representation for the
Taliban in national and subnational government, an amnesty, and fighter
demobilization and reintegration assistance. In Colombia, the war was
stalled at a much lower level of conflict when negotiations with the
leftist guerrillas began, and the basic trends for the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were headed downward. [The opposite is
the case]{.underline} in Afghanistan, where Afghan security forces by
and large remain weak, often reach accommodation with the Taliban, and
suffer from many deficiencies.

The U.S. military presence has slowed the Taliban's military and
political gains, but not reversed them (even when American troop levels
were 100,000 strong). It has no prospect of accomplishing them with
5,000 or 10,000 troops staying for another five or 10 years, let alone
less. Since 2015, the U.S. approach to Afghanistan has been staying and
praying --- praying that the Taliban will make enough strategic mistakes
to do itself in on the battlefield. It has not.

[Nor has the United States managed to redress another key malady of
Afghanistan: the perpetually parochial, fractious, and corrupt political
elite, which engages in disruptive politicking instead of
governing]{.underline}, even as Afghanistan has burned in an
intensifying insurgency. Neither U.S. and international donor threats to
reduce aid nor the ever-clearer and nearer prospect of the U.S. military
withdrawal have swayed politicians toward unity against the Taliban and
fundamentally improved governance.

Moreover, [sustaining a U.S. military deployment in Afghanistan until a
peace deal is reached would neglect the fact that any serious
negotiations amidst the ground realities require the Afghan government
to cede a considerable amount of power to the Taliban]{.underline}. The
Afghan government has naturally not wanted to do so, and thus had had no
interest in seriously negotiating with the Taliban. As long as there was
a prospect for the United States staying militarily and propping up the
Afghan government, Kabul has had little incentive to negotiate.
Conversely, a firm U.S. withdrawal date --- which Trump and now Biden
have declared ---incentivizes the Taliban not to negotiate until after
U.S. troops are gone and the Taliban gains more power.

Supporters of a sustained presence point out that the U.S. withdrawal is
abrupt; rather, Washington has repeatedly and ever more strongly
signaled it over a decade. In 2014, for instance, the Obama
administration was on the verge of going merely to an embassy-level
military presence. But the Afghan government and political elites have
ignored the steady warnings, hoping instead to entangle the United
States with an open-ended military commitment until the Taliban was much
weakened, however many years or decades that would take.

### Heg bad

#### Multipolarity is inevitable -- maintaining U.S. hegemony prompts superpower conflict

Dr. Nadia **Helmy '22**, April 14, "The Chinese theory on "the end of
American hegemony" after the Ukrainian war," MODERN DIPLOMACY,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/04/14/the-chinese-theory-on-the-end-of-american-hegemony-after-the-ukrainian-war/

From my point of view, in my personal belief that **[the multipolar
international system has already begun to become clear]{.underline}**,
and before the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian war in the first place,
with its many aspects of applications and features. We can find the
analyses done by the "Harvard University" in the USA, emphasizing that
[China is quickly catching up with the United States of America in terms
of (technology, military and strategic capabilities), despite the
dominance of the United States of America over international finance and
research and development]{.underline}.

Here, China is well aware of the (American desire for global hegemony
and the unilateral system to direct the whole world). Therefore, the
United States of America is concerned about the Chinese and Russian
powers, especially after Russia launched its current attack against
Ukraine, due to the interference of the United States of America and the
West in Russia's spheres of influence, with an attempt Ukraine's
inclusion in NATO, with the realization that China is the second largest
developed economy in the world and has enormous military defense
capabilities, and its Russian ally is a formidable military force that
Washington and its allies in NATO fear, which was evident during the
Ukraine war, as well as regional influence. [Russia and China together
have intertwined and connected borders and sprawling geographic spaces
internally and externally, in addition to the abundance of resources,
and]{.underline} the most important thing for me is
[encouraging]{.underline} their citizens to (belief in the idea of
​​national tide and a sense of [popular nationalism]{.underline} and
strength globally **[in the face of American and Western
hegemony]{.underline}** to stop and limit their power and call for their
national popular leaders to rally with their leaders).

[China is seeking to achieve a high degree of strategic cohesion with
Russia]{.underline}, with ([expanding their alliances globally between
the developing countries of the South, which are represented in the
African, Arab and Latin American countries]{.underline}). Therefore, the
United States of America realizes the strength of the alliance and
partnership between China and Russia, and the strong support for each
other politically, economically, militarily and technologically. China
has also become more aware that [through deep political, economic and
security cooperation with Russia, China will ensure the possibility of
forming a multipolarity, with the presence of more than one
international and regional pole around the world, with an emphasis on
expanding]{.underline} this through ([encouraging more different
developing countries to join their alliance to reform the current world
system]{.underline}, which is dominated by American policies and
undermines the sovereignty of weak and marginalized countries by
interfering in the internal affairs of countries to ensure their control
over them).

We find that in the face of the American economic power, [China and
Russia together represent about 77% of the gross domestic product of the
United States of America]{.underline} alone, in the current value of the
dollar and in comparison to the purchasing power parity of Russia and
China together compared to Washington, [and]{.underline} in addition,
[the United States of America is now burdened with debt]{.underline},
which has increased to reach about \$30 trillion, with (the US debt
ratio exceeds many times the value and proportion of its GDP, which
[China is well aware of]{.underline} about the [decline in US economic
power globally]{.underline}).

In view of the United States of America's understanding of the
indicators and axes of power, China and Russia, [the United States of
America has become **more and more**]{.underline} promoting
**[confrontational]{.underline}** concepts in their confrontation, as
the most **[threatening]{.underline}** countries to **[the
world]{.underline}**. With the American focus on (the issue of the rise
of China and the ideological confrontation with the Communist Party of
China as a civilization different from the West and liberal American and
Western concepts. As a result, Washington has become more eager to
impede and halt Chinese growth in particular and limit the scope and
limits of the partnership and alliance between China and Russia). Which
the Egyptian researcher has carefully analyzed during the
Ukrainian-Russian war, with the American insistence on the need for
China to adopt a clear position on that Russian war against Ukraine, and
Washington's attempt to take strict commitments against China to ensure
that it does not support Russia economically. This is what China and its
communist leaders have become aware of, and are aware of these American
methods to drive a wedge between it and Russia and President "Putin".

[The whole world is aware that these close relations and alliances
between China and Russia are the cornerstone for establishing and
forming a multipolar international system, in the face of US policies
that are still seeking to preserve their global dominant
uniqueness]{.underline}. Therefore, [China and Russia are]{.underline}
trying to expand the scope of their international partnerships through
(the Chinese Silk Road, launching initiatives for development
partnership with developing countries of the South, African, Arab
countries, Latin and South American countries), because success in this
strategy is [enough to break]{.underline} that [American hegemony, and
is a **basic guarantee for the transition for a multipolar
world**]{.underline}.

Here we analyze the impact of the [strategic mistakes committed by the
United States]{.underline} of America to **[destabilize the
world]{.underline}**, [by increasing the **intensity of conflict and
international polarization**]{.underline}, as well as its inability to
modernize the global system, to overcome shortcomings, challenges and
new competitions, but Washington has created many international crises
in large parts of the world, Such as: (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,
Venezuela)...etc. And its spending of a large budget that exceeded 8
trillion dollars for the war on terrorism, which proved the extent of
the American failure and impotence in confronting it after its
humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban movement's
control of the government. These are the internationally [failed
American policies]{.underline} that [caused a **state of global
division**]{.underline} in its confrontation.

Therefore, from my point of view, the United States of America is trying
here to (take advantage of the crisis of the current Russian war against
Ukraine to unite the front of NATO and its members in the West in the
face of Russia and President "Putin" under its leadership) to assert its
hegemony and uniqueness globally in the face of China and Russia, which
is what it must be aware of. The countries of the European Union, in
view of the violation by the United States of its covenants and harm to
the interests of its European partners, and the most prominent example
to me of this issue, is the (American signing of the Aukus military
defense agreement with Australia and Britain in the face of France),
which caused the Europeans and France to lose that deal, passing
Washington's interests and its excessive selfishness in dealing with its
European allies by giving preference to its interests over it and
passing it in the face of them, harming them in practice.

On the other hand, [the United States of America failed to adapt to the
changing global economy]{.underline}, unlike China, after a number of
global economic crises, such as: (the Corona virus pandemic, the global
financial crisis in 2008, the Ukraine crisis), and others. Which caused
(millions of American citizens to lose their jobs, especially in the
field of manufacturing and technology), which the United States of
America tried to evade internally by blaming the unfair trade policies
pursued by China internationally in confronting them.

Here we will find the extent of Chinese President Xi Jinping's
insistence, in all his political speeches, to emphasize the concept of
(the common future of humanity), and to emphasize his slogan around (the
Chinese dream), to achieve a well-off society, and to work according to
the principle of mutual benefit for all, and international profit for
all. With President (Xi Jinping's focusing on the path leading to the
realization of this Chinese dream), through three axes, which are: (the
Chinese road, the Chinese spirit, and the Chinese power).

The speeches of Comrade Chinese President "Xi Jinping" are focusing on
the keys and mechanisms for implementing this Chinese dream in an
internationally multipolar world, and the extent to which this is
appropriate for China and the rest of the world. We find that the
essence of implementing this Chinese dream internally is to reach an
internationally multipolar world away from the concepts of American
hegemony. Hence, this Chinese dream of an international multilateral
world has become (the essence of Chinese national identity by seeking to
restore its influence as a force by following China and the ruling
Communist Party leaders for several important policies, including the
axes of development and reform policy plans across China). In the end,
it reflects all (the components of the basic socialist culture and
values ​​of China, as well as that Chinese spirit that is in harmony with
the goals of the Chinese state, the nation and all the Chinese people).

Based on this aforementioned analysis, we can conclude that [American
hegemony has already ended globally or is on the way to disappearing or
evading, but **achieving (a stable global balance of power) is still
possible**]{.underline}.

[[The longer the conflict continues, the more it potentially risks
undermining NATO\'s cohesion]{.mark}. For the time being, the scenario
of a direct military response has been ruled out by the allies because
of the absence of a legal obligation to intervene and because of the
risks of a direct confrontation with Russia. If this attitude can be
explained by Russia\'s status as a nuclear power]{.underline} (and is
comparable to the behaviour of Western countries during the Budapest
uprising of 1956, the Prague Spring of 1968, or the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan during the Cold War), [indirectly [it may encourage an
increase in war crimes committed by Russia. Therefore, it is not certain
that this position of non-intervention will hol]{.mark}d if Moscow uses
chemical weapons, especially because of public pressure in the
West]{.underline}.

In view of the arms deliveries, not to mention the influx of volunteers
transiting the border between Ukraine, on the one hand, and Poland,
Slovakia and Romania on the other, Russian actions against convoys
cannot be ruled out either, which again would entail the risk of both
escalation with NATO military involvement and disunity over such an
escalation among Alliance members. [Moreover, [overwhelming Ukraine with
weapons could facilitate non-state violence]{.mark}, arms trafficking
and terrorism [in the long term in Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Consequently, [[there may be]{.mark} short/medium term [dissension over

The Polish attempt to transfer MIG-29s to the Ukrainian armed forces,
the debate on a no-fly zone over Ukraine, or the unilateral U.S. embargo
on Russian hydrocarbons are all signals of potential future divergence
in this regard.

[[In the medium term, cohesion within the alliance both on the
Russian-Ukrainian conflict and beyond remains dependent on American
domestic politics]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the event of a Trumpist
Congress in 2022, or even a Trumpist president in January 2025, [NATO\'s

### NATO Link: Article 3 Resilience

#### Resilience key to the alliance---outlined in Article 3

Preparedness staff, Defence Policy and Planning Division, NATO,
"Resilience: The First Line of Defence," NATO REVIEW, 2---27---19,

accessed 6-3-22\]

The current [[unpredictable security environment has led to a renewed
focus on civil preparedness.]{.mark} NATO]{.underline} and its member
states [must be ready for a wide range of contingencies, which could
severely impact societies and critical infrastructure]{.underline}.

Since the early 1950s, NATO has had an important role in supporting and
promoting civil preparedness among Allies. Indeed, [the [principle of
resilience is set out in Article 3]{.mark} of the Alliance's founding
treaty, [which requires all Allies to "maintain and develop their
individual and collective capacity to resist armed
attack".]{.mark}]{.underline} [This]{.mark} involves supporting
continuity of government, and the provision of essential services in
member states and civil support to the military.

Through much of the Cold War era, civil preparedness (then known as
civil emergency planning) was well organised and resourced by Allies,
and was reflected in NATO's organisation and command structure. During
the 1990s, however, much of the detailed civil preparedness planning,
structures and capabilities were substantially reduced, both at national
level and at NATO.

[[Events since 2014]{.underline}]{.mark} -- most notably Russia's
illegal annexation of Crimea and the rise of ISIS/Daesh -- [signalled a
change in the strategic environment, **[prompt]{.mark}**ing [the
Alliance to strengthen its deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} and defence
posture. Meanwhile, terrorist and [hybrid threats (particularly recent
cyber attacks) continue to target the civil population and critical
infrastructures]{.underline}, owned largely by the private sector.
[[These developments had a profound effect, bringing into sharp focus
the need to boost resilience through civil preparedness]{.mark}.
T]{.underline}oday, Allies are pursuing a step-by-step approach to this
end -- an effort that complements NATO's military modernisation and its
overall deterrence and defence posture.

While civil [preparedness]{.underline} is primarily a national
responsibility, [it is an important aspect of NATO's
security]{.underline}. Indeed, [[strengthening national resilience
provides a better foundation for collective

through an "all-hazards" approach: planning and preparedness that is
relevant for all types of threats, whether it be natural
disastershazards, hybrid warfare challenges, terrorism, armed conflict,
or anything in between. [[National authorities have realised that the
risks and vulnerabilities they face]{.mark}, amplified by the level of
interdependence among the sectors, [requires a whole-of-government
effort]{.mark} as well as more direct cooperation with the private
sector]{.underline}.

NATO's civil [preparedness has facilitated and supported national
efforts]{.underline}, developing sector-specific guidance and tools to
assist national authorities in their effort to meet the ambition
established by the seven baseline requirements. These include guidance
on a range of issues, including how to deal with the movement of tens to
hundreds of thousands of people; addressing cyber risks to the health
sector; comprehensive planning for incidents involving mass casualties;
and ensuring security of medical supply arrangements. NATO's civil
experts, who are based in Allied nations, have helped assess and
provided tailored advice on measures to enhance resilience and levels of
civil preparedness.

### NATO Link: Cyber Turn---2AC

#### Cyber cooperation [pivots NATO]{.underline} to address the [threat]{.underline} posed by China and [enables coordination]{.underline} with the EU

\[Liselotte Odgaard, Professor, Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies

NATO in Cyber and Outer Space

[[Cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} and space [[is a promising arena for NATO
to address China]{.mark} challenges [by building member state
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like the air and sea domains, as areas
that belong to no one state and which provide access to much of the
globe, [they form part of the global commons. C[ommand of the commons
has been the key enabler of]{.mark} the [US global]{.mark} position of
[power]{.mark}]{.underline} for many decades.26 However, [China wields a
sufficient range of]{.underline} sea, air, [cyber]{.underline}, and
space [capabilities such that the [global commons is now]{.mark} a
[contested]{.mark} zone.]{.underline} In contrast to the sea and air
domains, [[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and space [[are sparsely
regulated. This lack of international norms enhances the risk of
conflict based on misperception, making NATO cooperation
**pertinent**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Adversarial activities toward the
US and Europe in]{.underline} the [cyber]{.underline} and space domain
[threaten transatlantic security]{.underline}. [[These come]{.mark} not
just from China, but also [from other adversaries such as Russia and
Ira]{.mark}n]{.underline}. Mechanisms for addressing these challenges in
the military sector are essentially generic and not, at least in their
basic design, established with a particular country in mind. Thus,
[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and space [[provide an avenue for NATO to
contribute significantly to deterrence of China without having to combat
major internal resistance]{.mark}. NATO would also benefit from
long-standing US-EU cooperation on cyber]{.underline} and space
issues.27

NATO has vowed to clarify Article Five's collective defense commitment
to encompass threats to satellites in space and coordinated
cyberattacks. NATO can design this effort to include adversarial
behavior from China. The alliance already has an array of instruments to
deal with cyber and space challenges from adversaries. These can be
extended to encompass China without pronouncing it a threat.28 This
approach allows the US and Europe time to adjust their cooperation to
take into account the fact that China poses military threats to them
both without explicitly using the language of threat at a time when NATO
members do not agree if China should be defined as a challenge that can
trigger Article Five responses.

Since the late 1990s, the vulnerability of shared space assets to
cyberattacks has been a concern for both the US and Europe. For example,
in 1998 a USGerman satellite, used for peering into deep space, was
rendered useless after it turned suddenly toward the sun, damaging its
High Resolution Imager by exposure. NASA later determined that the
accident was linked to a cyber-intrusion at the Goddard Space Flight
Center. Coordinated cyberattacks have emerged as a major threat to both
the US and Europe since the late 1990s. For example, for about eighteen
minutes on April 8, 2010, China Telecom advertised erroneous network
traffic routes that instructed US and other foreign internet traffic to
travel through Chinese servers. Other servers around the world quickly
adopted these paths, routing all traffic, including government and
military traffic, to about 15 percent of the internet's destinations
through servers located in China.29

In the future, the need to enhance situational awareness in space is
likely to lead to further integration of space assets between the US and
its allies. Civilian entry points are likely to provide a growing
opportunity for infiltration. The weak state of cybersecurity in
civilian agencies should also be considered. Chinese military doctrine
prioritizes weaponry that targets vulnerabilities in the deployment of
US and allied power, such as the use of cyberattacks to disrupt
surveillance assets, intelligence networks, and command-and-control
systems.30 These threats are significant, since next generation systems,
including fighter aircraft, destroyers, and special forces, will not
function without access to space communication and space-derived data.

[Although European and US allies have]{.underline} indigenous space
[programs]{.underline} outside the NATO framework, [cyber
security]{.underline} and outer space [would be a useful field for joint
explorations of how to divert and manage attacks]{.underline} and
identify an agency which can coordinate transatlantic responses to
attacks. [Allies are embedded in a range of information networks which
may be disrupted, giving rise to alliance management
concerns]{.underline} emerging from attacks. [The [lack of red
lines]{.mark}]{.underline} regarding behavior in cyber and outer space
between the US and its allies [on one hand, and adversaries such as
China on the other, [adds to the risk of misperception and escalation,
and]{.mark} hence also [highlights the need for allied coordination to
avoid starting a war by mistake. An improved NATO dialogue on safeguards
and alliance consultation could also assist communication with
China]{.mark} on arms control and conflict prevention in
cyber]{.underline} and outer [space, which is not currently taking
place]{.underline}.

Looking to the future, [[NATO's success in establishing transatlantic
mechanisms for cyber]{.underline}]{.mark} and outer space safeguards and
consultation [[will be crucial to allow NATO a key role in taking on the
China challenge in ways that help restore]{.mark} faith in [NATO's
credibility]{.mark} as a provider of collective defense in all domains.
It will also assist NATO in straddling the chasm between member states
prioritizing threats from either China, Russia, the Middle East, or
North Africa]{.underline}, since cyber and space threats potentially
stem from all of them, and the effectiveness of cyber and space defense
mechanisms do not necessarily depend on geographical origin.

Improved communication between NATO and the EU will be essential for
NATO to successfully address the military aspects of cyber and space
threats. The framework for permanent EU-NATO relations, Berlin Plus, was
concluded in March 2003. It allows for the exchange of classified
information, the EU's use of NATO assets and capabilities for EU-led
crisis management operations, and the establishment of consultation
arrangements.31 Due to disagreements over responsibilities and
jurisdiction, however, meaningful coordination did not take place until
July 2016. On this occasion, NATO and the EU issued a joint declaration
stating their intention to work together on security and defense
responses to unprecedented challenges emanating from the South and East
of the Euro-Atlantic area.32 During Biden's visit to Brussels in June
2021, [NATO promised to strengthen cooperation with the EU on promoting
peace and stability including protecting critical infrastructure,
strengthening resilience]{.underline}, maintaining a technological edge,
and addressing challenges to a rules-based order.33 The EU-US summit
statement from the same visit merely reaffirms support for robust
NATO-EU cooperation and promises to strengthen the partnership.34 At the
level of policy implementation, it is clear when talking to NATO and EU
officials that usually they do not coordinate their strategies and
tactics for countering China challenges.35

The EU-US summit statement's negligible mention of cooperation with NATO
indicates that [[the ball is in NATO's court if strengthening NATO-EU
coordination is to take place]{.mark}.]{.underline} [French and German
concerns about entrapment are a major barrier to meaningful NATO-EU
cooperatio]{.underline}n. The area of [cyber]{.underline} and space
security [may allow NATO to work around this roadblock]{.underline}. In
line with the EU's practice of supporting the efforts of groups of
member states to take the lead on issues where EU institutions cannot
trump sovereignty, in the area of cybersecurity the EU has decentralized
implementation to work around national resistance. This has allowed the
EU to respond collectively and effectively to cyberattacks in Europe,
primarily through bolstering capacities and law enforcement
cooperation.36 However, the [EU is not yet a globally influential and
effective cyber-power because differences among member
states]{.underline} over issues such as whether to prioritize tech
sovereignty or Europe's global tech competitiveness prevent the EU from
acting in unison on the global stage.

The first US-EU TTC meeting held in September 2021 was an important step
in strengthening the EU's global position in cooperation with the United
States, and hence called into question whether NATO has a role to play
in cyber security.37 [The next couple of years will demonstrate whether
the EU and the US are able to focus on becoming mutually supportive
global cyber security guardians]{.underline} by cooperating on
strengthening investment screening, export controls, and rebalance
global supply chains in semiconductors. The successful implementation on
both sides of the Atlantic of the recommendations of the TTC working
groups will determine if transatlantic cooperation positions the US and
the EU as global partners in guarding cyber space. In part, this will
depend on the EU's ability to forge common positions that meet the US
halfway on issues such as tech sovereignty and data privacy, points of
contention through which transatlantic relations have been marred by
conflict.

[The [potential convergence of transatlantic views on cybersecurity
leaves room for NATO to play a significant role]{.mark} because the EU
is a civilian and economic, rather than military, set of
institutions]{.underline}. The NATO summit in Brussels in 2018 carved
out a role for NATO which the EU cannot fulfill, allowing NATO members
to integrate their sovereign cyber capabilities into NATO operations and
missions.38 However, compared to the EU's major role in cyber, NATO's
role is negligible. As EU civil-military cooperation ramps up in
enhancing Europe's autonomous defense profile while allowing US
companies a role in this effort, the union looks set to become an even
more dominant actor in transatlantic cyber defense. [[Because NATO is a
military organization, it has the procedures]{.mark} and instruments [to
position itself in a key role in coordinating and implementing the
military aspects of cyber defense]{.mark} between the US and Europe. The
multinational cybersecurity effort which is confronting the global
threat posed by Chinese state-sponsored cyberattacks involves NATO, the
EU, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, and sets NATO off to a good start
in enhancing its profile in countering Chinese challenges to
transatlantic cybersecurity]{.underline}.39 However, it remains to be
seen if it manages to deliver mechanisms that succeed in integrating
allied responses in the military sector in a way that complements US and
EU cyber defense initiatives.

In outer space, the EU is also increasingly active, recognizing the need
to deepen investments in areas such as satellite navigation, earth
observation, space situational awareness, and secure communications,
which are all central to enhanced space security. The EU has established
the EU Agency for the Space Programme, which has oversight over
everything the EU does in orbit as a bloc. Moreover, the EU uses the
European Space Agency (ESA) as technical advisor and industrial
procurement agent. This setup allows the EU to become more agile,
dynamic, and innovative in space as rapid industrialization is taking
place with US entrepreneurs and well-funded Chinese space programs in
leading roles.40 In the pipeline are a next generation of Europe's
satellite-navigation system, Galileo, and an extension of the scope and
capabilities of its Copernicus-Sentinel spacecraft, which monitors the
state of the planet. The EU focuses on ensuring that Europe has
independent space capabilities, but it does not develop instruments such
as space weapons systems.41

In the outer space realm, NATO has tremendous potential for playing a
key role in developing instruments in the military sector that involve
European and US space capabilities. NATO's decision to declare outer
space an operational domain at the London summit in 2019 is a first step
in allowing NATO an active role in addressing growing anti-satellite
threats from China and Russia.42 With the US as the leading power in
outer space and with the EU developing its space platforms to enhance
situational awareness and security, NATO has the tools to work out a
common transatlantic definition of the anti-satellite challenges that
need to be addressed. The establishment of mechanisms that ensure
coordination across military NATO commands regarding intelligence
gathering and the interface between cyber and space defense, as well as
civilian and military occurrences and initiatives, would potentially
strengthen the ability of allies to counter anti-satellite threats
considerably. As with cyber, NATO must first integrate the space issue
into all its organizational and operational structures, and secondly,
develop mechanisms that focus on coordination between US and European
capacities on the basis of a common understanding of the challenges to
be addressed.

### NATO Link: Cyber Turn---Ext

#### [NATO]{.underline} is [critical]{.underline}---action [thwarts]{.underline} Chinese efforts to [undermine]{.underline} the liberal order, [shores up]{.underline} weak links in the alliance

Defending Cyber and Outer Space," WASHINGTON QUARTERLY v. 45 n., 1,
Spring 2022, p. 169-170\]

[Washington increasingly looks to the EU rather than NATO]{.underline}
[for guidance on]{.underline} Europe's future [security
policy]{.underline}. [One reason is that [NATO's toolbox is lagging
in]{.mark}]{.underline} domains such as **[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and outer space, although cyber and outer space operations are key
enablers of actions in all domains including air, sea, and land. One
indication of this is the US-EU negotiations surrounding a common
response to cyber threats which took place during the first US-EU Trade
and Technology Council (TTC) meeting in Pittsburgh in September 2021. In
addition, during Trump's presidency, longstanding US dissatisfaction
with Europe's modest defense spending threatened to put NATO on the
backburner in transatlantic security debates.5 Since then, Russia's
invasion of Ukraine has elicited a sea change in German defense policy
with the announcement in February 2022 that defense spending will
increase to more than 2 percent of its gross domestic output annually.6
While this may be a convincing signal that Europe will finally devote
the resources required for its own defense and revive NATO's central
role in transatlantic security, there is also a risk that China will be
moved to the periphery of the alliance's agenda.

On February 11, 2022, during the runup to the Russian-Ukrainian war, the
Biden administration published its Indo-Pacific strategy as US Secretary
of State Anthony Blinken was in the midst of a Pacific trip to
Australia, Fiji, and Hawaii.7 This US prioritization signaled that
despite Moscow's war in Europe, Washington remains committed to
strengthening its presence in the Indo-Pacific and competing with China.
If the US drops the ball on the Indo-Pacific, Washington is concerned
that China might use force against Taiwan.8 Consequently, the key
question for the US is how many resources can be tied up in Europe
without losing sight of the long-term goal: deterrence of China. [[As US
strategic competition with China increases while NATO is sitting on the
fence, failure to develop a transatlantic defense policy that addresses
China will leave Europe vulnerable to China's ability to exploit the
weak links in European defense arrangements]{.mark}, which are newly
fragmented by the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}.

[EU efforts to build an independent regional defense profile and nurture
cooperation between Europe's defense industry and national defense
communities reflect a growing recognition that the region needs to
become a self-reliant defense a]{.underline}ctor. However, [Europe still
needs to demonstrate that self-reliance does not imply merely focusing
on Europe's periphery. Otherwise, the industrial challenges from China
may outcompete Europe's defense industry]{.underline}. Shipbuilding is a
case in point. By 2021, China built 50 percent of all existing ships in
the world. Through design collaboration agreements, cyber espionage, and
acquisitions, China has copied advanced innovative ship designs.
Enormous financial resources from the state allow Chinese companies to
enjoy economies of scale by building dual-use factories which not only
outcompete Western companies in the commercial shipbuilding industry,
but also threaten the production of navy vessels. [If not taken
seriously, Europe and the US may soon have no choice but to buy frigates
from China]{.underline}.10 [This example demonstrates the centrality of
China for global economic and [security developments]{.mark} and [should
encourage Europe to manifest a position of unified strength in defending
NATO member states against Chinese security challenges]{.mark}. This
realization will help convince the US and its adversaries that Europe
continues to be a credible partner in countering common threats against
transatlantic security, whether they appear in or beyond the European
region.]{.underline}

[[China's challenges]{.mark} to US and European security
[constitute]{.mark} such [common threats]{.mark} across a broad range of
sectors]{.underline}. [These include gradual [reinterpretations
o]{.mark}]{.underline}f principles [of [international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[subversion of]{.underline}]{.mark}
universal liberal [[market]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[practices]{.underline}, [and cyber insurgencies]{.underline}]{.mark}
[targeting]{.underline} a wide range of civilian and military entities.
[These]{.underline} Chinese [policies all have major military
implications because they are related to developments in the operating
principles, capabilities, and priorities of China's armed forces. [Only
NATO can offer an integrated transatlantic response to the military
aspects of Chinese policies]{.mark} that threaten those sectors across
the globe, including European actors. [NATO's involvement is essential
if the credibility of the alliance's security guarantees is to be
preserved and an effective response to China's encroachments on a
liberal rules-based order is to be established]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The omnipresent character of the China threat demonstrates that it is
long overdue for NATO to position itself as a significant player in
addressing Beijing's challenges to transatlantic security. NATO is key
to keeping US and European security policies coordinated when applying
mechanisms of deterrence and defense against Chinese challenges. If
transatlantic unity of purpose is lost, both the US and Europe are far
less likely to succeed in addressing China]{.mark}
sufficiently]{.underline}.

#### NATO coordination enables coalitions of the willing within the alliance to solve the Chinese hybrid threat

**Speranza, Cetner for European Policy Analysis researcher, '20**

for European Policy Analysis, "China Is NATO's New Problem," FOREIGN
POLICY, 7---8---20,

accessed 5-7-22\]

Over the past decade, Chinese companies have invested billions of
dollars throughout Europe---buying up critical infrastructure and
increasing Beijing's political clout across the continent. As Chinese
firms, often with strong ties to the state and Chinese Communist Party
(CCP), acquire parts of sensitive ports, pipelines, and
telecommunication networks, China's incursions into Europe's security
umbrella are drawing serious concern.

But NATO, long worried about Russia, has largely been silent on China.
Now, that is changing. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg recently
called on the alliance to stand up to Beijing's "bullying and coercion,"
underscoring how China's rise is fundamentally shifting the global
balance of power. It's apparent that NATO can no longer ignore the
threat. If the alliance hopes to remain competitive, it will need to
develop a new strategy for dealing with Beijing.

First, [NATO needs a common assessment of [China's hybrid
threats]{.mark}---]{.underline}a mix of diplomatic, economic, security,
information, and technological actions designed to quietly undermine
democratic states and institutions to Beijing's benefit while avoiding a
traditional conflict. While China's conventional military threat in the
Indo-Pacific is far from NATO's borders, its hybrid activities are
happening in the alliance's own backyard.

[Cyber-espionage, intellectual property theft, infiltration of critical
infrastructure, debt manipulation, and disinformation are prime
examples.]{.underline} W[hile these threats may seem to fall outside of
NATO's purview, they [pose **serious** **security** **risks** for the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, China's desire to invest in
Lithuania's Klaipeda Port may not look like a problem for NATO on its
surface. But its investments have worrying strings attached that give
China operating control over the infrastructure. That control could
decrease allies' willingness to move military forces---including
sensitive technologies---through the port and its surrounding networks.
This could lead to disrupted planning and fewer military exercises,
decreasing NATO's ability to defend the Baltic States during a crisis
with Russia. This could also open the door for pragmatic collaboration
between China and Russia to undermine trans-Atlantic security.

[Allies need to forge a shared understanding of these risks through
information-sharing and dialogue]{.underline}---no small feat for
countries that do not see eye to eye on China. Some are even willing to
ignore such vulnerabilities, due to economic benefits or disenchantment
with trans-Atlantic institutions. The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[has a **critical** role to play in
getting allies on the **same page**]{.mark} [and setting common goals
for countering China's hybrid activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Second, [NATO needs to focus on public diplomacy]{.underline}. NATO has
an important role to play in the battle against the CCP's global
narratives, which Beijing promulgates through hybrid activities. To
defend the trans-Atlantic values on which the alliance is
built---freedom, democracy, rule of law, and human rights---NATO should
clearly communicate China's violations of these principles and its
propaganda efforts to cover them up. (These include, among others, human
rights abuses against ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang and violations of the
U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea in the South China Sea.) NATO
should also enhance its outreach to key partners in the Indo-Pacific,
such as Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, which can serve
as important counterweights to Chinese influence in the region.
Effective public messaging also means getting serious about attributing
the blame for attacks, as the European Commission recently did over
Chinese disinformation around COVID-19, to raise the pressure on Chinese
officials. Trans-Atlantic countries have struggled to shape China's
behavior because they cannot prove malign intent or agree to call out
Beijing for its subversive efforts. Allies should develop clearer
guidelines---what needs to be proved, by whom, and to what degree---to
enable collective attribution. NATO is strongest when it speaks with one
voice. It should use that voice to demand transparency and change from
China.

Third, the alliance should step up its counteroffensive. [China's hybrid
actions intentionally blur the lines between what is legally
permissible, politically inappropriate, and downright
escalatory]{.underline}.

[This makes it difficult for leaders to determine appropriate responses,
producing a reactionary approach]{.underline} thus far. But [an
intensifying geostrategic competition has already begun. To
compete]{.underline} in this environment, [[the trans-Atlantic community
needs a more proactive approach. Rather than
waiting]{.underline}]{.mark} for China to invest in the next major
European port, [allies should coordinate]{.underline} legislation to
prevent the riskiest Chinese acquisitions. And rather than waiting for
more Chinese cyberintrusions, [[allies should collaborate on
responsible, targeted]{.underline}]{.mark} offensive
[[cyberactions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Over time, [this would help
dissuade China from manipulating investments in critical infrastructure,
conducting cyber-espionage, and other hybrid activities]{.underline}.
While adopting a more offensive posture remains controversial among
certain allies[, it is gaining traction across Europe and is strongly
supported in Washington. Although NATO, as a defensive alliance, should
not implement such a counteroffensive, [policymakers should leverage it
as the primary forum to coordinate actions]{.mark} among willing
nations.]{.underline}

Fourth, [[NATO needs to deepen its cooperation with other key players,
such as the]{.mark} **[E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion
[and]{.mark} the [private sector]{.mark}]{.underline}. Where NATO lacks
the mandate and means, the EU and multinational businesses play critical
roles in developing, implementing, and enforcing the legislation and
financial incentives necessary to counter Chinese hybrid threats.
Complementary to that, NATO and its allies can focus on providing
intelligence, defending cyberspace, developing capability targets for
new technologies, conducting exercises and contingency planning,
informing resilience requirements for secure infrastructure, and
bolstering deterrence. Despite the political obstacles that impede more
formal NATO-EU cooperation, allies should look to the European Centre of
Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki to bring together
NATO and EU staff, national officials, and industry voices in one place
to align their counter-hybrid policies for China.

[The Chinese government's [manipulative efforts around]{.mark} the
**[corona]{.mark}**virus [have thrust China's hybrid activities to the
center of trans-Atlantic debates. Policymakers need to seize the moment
and respond by "using NATO more politically]{.mark}]{.underline}," in
Stoltenberg's words[. NATO is first and foremost about its nations. In
the fight against China's hybrid threats, these nations bring much more
to the table than military power alone. [They have access to a broad
range of tools]{.mark}]{.underline}---military, political, economic,
technological, and information---[[which the alliance can use to
its]{.mark} collective geopolitical [advantage in the competition with
China]{.mark}. [What NATO needs]{.mark} now [is a strategy to leverage
those tools]{.mark} in a coordinated manner. [That will go a long way in
solving NATO's China problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### NATO Link: Deterrence Turn---2AC

#### \[x\] Resilience enhances deterrence

AFFAIRS, Ed. O.Thränert & M/ Zapfe, Center for Security Studies, 2018,
p. 77-78\]

[Resilience thinking and [being resilient can offer **concrete**
**advantages** in]{.mark}]{.underline} security policy, and specifically
in [[deterrence]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Applied [resilience is becoming
the **cornerstone** of security policy, and represents the **fifth
wave** of deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Modern threats are complex]{.mark}, multiactor, cross-scale problems,
[which must be met with agile, resilience]{.mark} thinking-style
institutional [decisionmaking]{.mark}]{.underline} that fits the nature
of the problems. [[Proactively countering complex threats with]{.mark}
equally networked and [distributed policy responses]{.mark}, guided by
resilience, [will improve the effectiveness of those]{.mark} security
[polici]{.mark}es]{.underline}. In this context, the [increasing
resilience]{.underline} of society, critical infrastructure, and
organizations -- the product of a decade of resilience promotion in
security policies -- [and the concomitant [reductions in vulnerability
will deter asymmetric threats]{.mark} by denying threatening actors
suitable targets for their attacks.]{.underline}

Where classical (nuclear) deterrence was hierarchical and deterministic,
based on the known relationships between the actors, and on the simple
and well-understood principle of assured destruction, which held the
actors in check, modern deterrence is altogether different. [Threats are
uncertain, and unpredictable; actors are unknown, as are the
vulnerabilities they target]{.underline}. As threats have become less
state-centered, and more likely to originate from distributed networks,
the means of addressing these threats must also change.

The fifth wave of deterrence development is rising at a point when
established international security practices are fumbling to respond
effectively to security challenges. [Resilience thinking presents a
potential breakthrough that can increase the ability of established
security institutions to improve their links and address complex threats
deliberatively. If institutions can accept the current shift toward
resilience as an important and practical one, [then the "complex
adaptive system" of international security is more likely to meet future
system changes or disruption]{.mark} in a more prepared
state.]{.underline} The fifth wave of deterrence will be characterized
by the network-driven, tailor-made solution.

Deterrence is an uncertain art, not a science, and if the
decision-making processes that determine deterrence actions do not match
the problems, it is unlikely that practical deterrence solutions
commensurate to modern threats can be identified and deployed.

Modern approaches to national and international security are already
built on networks, but control tends to remain hierarchical and linear.
Dealing with complex threats highlights the necessity to move away from
traditional reductionist and hierarchical approaches to problem
governance, and to engage existing networks with distributed and
deliberative approaches.

To a certain degree, policy failures must be accepted as inevitable in a
complex, uncertain, and unpredictable security environment. But [policy
failures will be more likely if policymaking processes are not suited to
this current security environment. If policy processes are
deterministic, reductionist, and hierarchical, then they are not suited
to governing systems that are characterized by nonlinearity,
unpredictability of interactions, and uncertain feedbacks. By contrast,
if policy processes are designed to match the complex systems and
problems they are attempting to govern -- i.e., if they are flexible,
reactive, and distributed -- then they are likely to be more
successful]{.underline}.

In broader strategic terms, [[resilience can be seen as an ingredient of
deterrence by denial,or "persuading the enemy not to attack by
convincing him that his attack will be defeated---that is, that he will
not be able to achieve his operational
objectives]{.underline}]{.mark}."9 [[Hybrid warfare]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategy---essentially a strategy aiming to cause disruption, confusion,
destabilization and paralysis (i.e., shape the behavior of a target
nation)---[[can be countered by demonstrating that all those aims are
beyond reach due to the target's resilience.]{.mark}]{.underline} For
instance:

• A high level of a society's competence in critical thinking and in
understanding the nature of such hybrid warfare tools as hostile
propaganda,political extremism,social protest campaigns or military
intimidation---in conjunction with society's trust in the integrity of
the political system, political leadership and government's
communication---negate the advantages of those tools.

[[More resilient countries]{.mark} -- where the whole of government as

civil preparedness planning -- [[have fewer vulnerabilities that
can]{.underline}]{.mark} otherwise [[be]{.mark} used as leverage or be
[targeted]{.mark}]{.underline} [b]{.mark}y adversaries. [[Resilience is
therefore an important aspect of deterrence by denial]{.mark}:
[persuading an adversary not to attack]{.mark} by convincing it that an
attack will not achieve its intended objectives]{.underline}.

[[Resilient societies]{.mark} also [have a greater propensity to bounce
back]{.mark}]{.underline} after crises: [[they tend to recover more
rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark} and are able to return to pre-crisis
functional levels with greater ease than less resilient societies. This
makes continuity of government and essential services to the population
more durable. Similarly, [[it enhances the ability for the civil sector
to support a NATO military operation, including the capacity to rapidly
reinforce]{.mark} an Ally]{.underline}.

Such [[resilience is of benefit across the spectrum of threats]{.mark},
from countering or responding to a terrorist attack to potential
collective defence scenarios. Consequently, enhancing resilience though
civil preparedness plays an important role in strengthening the
Alliance's deterrence and defence posture]{.underline}.

[[The nature of deterrence is facing a **phase shift**]{.underline},
[driven by the]{.underline}]{.mark} [multifaceted and complex nature of
the [modern threat landscape]{.mark}.]{.underline} Realistically,
[[deterrence must be]{.mark} a [**flexible** and **proactive**]{.mark}
occupation]{.underline}, composed of elements that should suit the
nature of the threat[. The notion of "tailor-made" deterrence begins to
address the complexity of modern threat by attempting to introduce a
more detailed understanding of the complex threat situation]{.underline}
in order to direct a customized response.21

[[Resilience thinking can be a **powerful** means of guiding the
development of an adaptive **tailor-made** deterrence
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}. The national-international security
landscape is illustrated as two interacting "Complex Adaptive Systems"
on page 73. The international and national systems interact and respond
to one another as they develop and change.22 Within this system,
[information and control is multidirectional, flowing between the
systems]{.underline} -- a state of affairs that has been described as
"panarchy".23 This is in contrast to a typical hierarchical system,
where control is exerted in a unidirectional manner. Complex human,
socio-technical, and human-ecological systems are arranged as panarchies
-- as systems that feature nested components, open information flow, and
constant change. [No element in these systems can be thought of as the
ultimate point of control]{.underline}.24

[[Given the complex threat environment, non-hierarchical decision-making
processes, like resilience thinking, are **particularly suitable**
because they match the non-hierarchical nature of the challenge to be
solved]{.underline}. [The ability of decision-makers to embrace emergent
opportunities and adapt quickly is
**imperative**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} While this ability
has always been important, it [is the diversity in the current threat

Resilience as a Credible Form of Deterrence?

The [[credibility of resilience as a deterrent option is closely
connected to the utility of resilience thinking in the context of
complex threats. Resilience is practical]{.mark} under these
circumstances [because it shifts the focus from preventing complex and
diverse threats to mitigating the consequences of these threats through
proactive anticipation, preparation, and adaptation]{.mark}. The new
complexity of threats]{.underline} (including terrorist, hybrid, and
cyber-threats) [is disrupting traditional deterrence
approaches.]{.underline}

These points speak to the utility of resilience as a deterrent option in
complex threat situations. However, like any other deterrent option,
resilience must be credible. Given the nature of deterrence as a
psychological strategy disruptor, for resilience to be a credible option
it must meet three criteria that are typical of all forms of deterrence:
commitment, capability, and communication.

[The trend towards committing to resilience in security policy is a
strong one]{.underline}. Given that there has already been a reasonably
long focus on resilience at national and sub-national scales in the
contexts of civil protection, critical infrastructure protection,
disaster risk management, public preparedness, and risk communication,25
systematically [[scaling up resilience as a national]{.mark} or
international security policy priority [will clearly demonstrate a real
commitment to resilience in deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Capability can be established through coherent and systemic
development of the practical actions that together contribute to
building resilience.]{.mark}]{.underline} These might include
establishing comprehensive and multi-thematic vulnerability assessments;
describing resilience in multiple contexts, finding commonalities;
establishing measurement tools and processes; encouraging flexibility
within security organizations to improve the ability to learn, adapt,
and respond; and investing in developing coherent practices across
security themes and sectors.

#### Ukrainian resistance proves the effectiveness of resilience strategies

[The [determined resistance by]{.mark} **[Ukraine]{.mark}**'s armed
forces and civil society]{.underline} against the Russian invasion that
began in February 2022 is [[a vivid demonstration of the central
importance of]{.mark} military and societal [resilience in the face of
external shocks. Civil and military preparedness may help save
Ukraine]{.mark} as an independent country]{.underline}. Had Moscow
understood more clearly the ability of Ukraine to resist Russian
military advances and maintain its sense of national purpose, the
Kremlin may have been deterred from launching the invasion.

[[The war in Ukraine adds further urgency to updating NATO's thinking
about]{.mark} the [resilience]{.mark} of alliance members]{.underline},
which will be reflected in the June 2022 Strategic Concept. [Resilience
in the face of armed attack is a fundamental commitment of NATO's 1949
Treaty,]{.underline} with Article 3 stating that parties to the treaty
will "separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective
self-help and mutual aid ... maintain and develop their individual and
collective capacity to resist armed attack".

#### Resilience is a necessary component of deterrence, even if it is not alone sufficient

**Kersanskas, Hybrid CoE researcher, '20**

\[Vytautas Kersankas, Deputy Director, Community of Interest on Hybrid
Influence, Hybrid CoE, "Deterrence: Proposing a More Strategic Approach
to Countering Hybrid Threats," HYBRID COE PAPER 2, Hybrid Centre of
Excellence, 3---20, p. 7\]

The discussion on how to counter hybrid threats frequently concentrates
on two response options. [The most common proposal for countering hybrid
threats is resilience building]{.underline}. The logic is clear: [every
state should seek to achieve social coherence and awareness, secure
critical infrastructure and transparent and open political systems, thus
making it harder for hostile actors to intervene effectively.
[Resilience a]{.mark}lso has [considerable second order
benefits]{.mark}, protecting states from threats like natural disasters
or industrial accidents.]{.underline}

Recent years have shown that [even the most developed and resilient
states are dealing with challenges emanating from the hostile activities
of state and non-state actors. [Resilience makes it harder]{.mark}, but
not impossible, [for hostile actors to cause harm by hybrid
means]{.mark}. Even though resilience should be at the core of the
response to hybrid threats and plays an important part in deterrence,
resilience building alone is not sufficient.]{.underline}

The other end of this debate circles around the immediate response to an
unfolding hybrid operation. It is straightforward to learn from cases
where the evidence of hostile activities is visible to everyone and the
response needs to be immediate and swift. In these scenarios, the
disruption has already happened, the damage is done, and so the hostile
actor has at least partly achieved its intended goal.

This paper suggests that [deterrence theory]{.underline}, one of the key
pillars of both post-World War 2 and post-Cold War security architecture
in the West, co[uld be applied to counter hybrid threats. This approach
turns on its head the challenge at the heart of countering hybrid
activity -- the assertion that hybrid activity cannot be countered until
it manifests itself]{.underline}. The paper suggests that [[effective
deterrence blends resilience and crisis response with the ability to
impose costs on hybrid aggressors.]{.underline}]{.mark} It shifts the
operational model from responsive to preventive, creating a forward
looking and strategic approach.

New challenges unconsidered a decade ago are also growing in speed and
scope. [[NATO has no choice but to bolster its engagement in]{.mark}
domains like [cyber]{.mark} and space that will have a considerable
impact on deterrence.]{.underline} Furthermore, [massive shifts caused
by climate change are challenging the security of NATO members and could
create crises in which they will be required to respond. [New
technologies are creating novel ways to undermine the resilience of
national infrastructures and democratic processes]{.mark},]{.underline}
threatening the core of Euro-Atlantic societies. However, [technologies,
like artificial intelligence, may also help in operational settings and
decision-making, or help identify multi-domain hybrid
operations]{.underline}. [[There are challenges and opportunities in
these emerging technologies, and they will require added investment and
engagement by NATO]{.mark} and its members.]{.underline}

### NATO Impact: China---NATO Focus Bad

#### Focusing on China fractures the alliance and undermines its ability to deter Russia

[[Individual NATO member states]{.mark}, and even the supranational EU
with its particular policy competencies, [have more tools to deal with
an emboldened China than does NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} as an
institution. NATO can deepen its existing engagements with Indo-Pacific
countries. This will ease cooperation with these governments and
militaries in the future and strengthen them (marginally) against
Chinese encroachment. It may also contribute to the governments involved
reaching common diplomatic positions, on freedom of navigation for
instance. [[Until China poses a military threat in the North Atlantic
Region]{.mark}, as an institution created for the purpose of collective
security, [NATO should have a very limited role]{.mark} when it comes to
dealing the challenges posed by Beijing.]{.underline}

[The reflection period offers NATO an opportunity to state clearly what
its responsibilities are when it comes to China]{.underline}, and what
its approach will be. To ensure that NATO does not lose focus on actual
military threats closer to home [it must]{.underline}:

\* [Acknowledge the Alliance's limitations when confronting some of
China's non-military threats and push member states to do
more]{.underline}. Some of the biggest challenges posed by China to
NATO's member states deal with investments in critical infrastructure,
disinformation campaigns, and encroachments in the technology sector
using Huawei's 5G. NATO should not pretend to lead on an issue for which
it lacks the needed policy competencies. Therefore, while policymakers
should look to NATO to provide a robust conventional and nuclear
deterrence for members of the Alliance, only the national capitals, and
in some cases the EU, have the political and economic tools that can
reduce the economic and political threats posed by China.

\* [Not let itself be distracted]{.underline}. With the BRI creeping
inside Europe's borders, the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mass
internment of the Uighur population, and the ongoing 5G debate in
Europe, it is no surprise that China is a major concern for Western
policymakers---and rightfully so. However, [[for NATO, the most
immediate threat, and the threat for which it was created and for which
it has the tools, is Russia. NATO should focus first and foremost on
this threat]{.underline}]{.mark}.

\* [Be realistic about the military threat facing the Alliance in the
North Atlantic area]{.underline}. At the time of this writing,
Russian--Chinese military activity in NATO's area of responsibility as
described in Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty has amounted to two
different exercises, spanning a total of 13 days, consisting of a total
of six PLAN ships over the course of the past five years. [[While NATO
should monitor Russian--Chinese military cooperation, the Alliance must
recognize that its number one priority is Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\* [[Not let China divide the Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}. As seen in
the single sentence devoted to China in NATO's joint statement, [[there
is no agreement inside the Alliance on what role]{.mark}, if any, [NATO
should play]{.mark} in dealing with Beijing. [When Alliance unity in the
face of Russian aggression is vital, now is not the time for NATO to
divide itself over the issue of China. This only benefits Moscow and
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Ensure that NATO remains a nuclear alliance. China is a nuclear power
with strategic reach. The threats associated with nuclear proliferation
make the world more dangerous today than it was during the Cold War,
making it critical that NATO maintain its "nuclear culture." As long as
the West could face a nuclear threat from any part of the world,
including Asia, NATO needs to remain a nuclear alliance.

Encourage the member states to coordinate a military strategy toward
China. While NATO as an institution should limit its military focus on
China, for certain member states, China is a main driver of foreign and
defense policy. This is particularly true of the U.S., and to a lesser
extent, Canada, France, and the U.K. Military training exercises in the
Indo--Pacific, or Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China
Sea, should be coordinated on a multilateral or bilateral basis at the
member-state level.

These efforts are clearly intended to be part of a comprehensive assess-
ment of the challenges posed by China. Nevertheless, [[such a broadening
of transatlantic security thinking may be constrained by NATO's
geographic and functional limitations, or by the reluctance of certain
member states to embed this kind of political dialogue in]{.mark} the
[NATO]{.mark} framework]{.underline}. Certainly, NATO is a
well-established forum in which European and North American
representatives already meet regularly. Among its members, the United
Kingdom, having just left the EU, would likely be interested in a
politi- cally strengthened NATO that holds ministerial meetings beyond
defence issues, notably economic ones.26 However, [[when it comes to
conducting a broader political reflection on China, NATO finds itself in
competition with other frameworks]{.underline}]{.mark}, some of which
directly include Indo-Pacific powers (the Quadrilateral Security
Dialogue, AUKUS, the G7), [while others possess a more varied range of
instruments in the economic and technological fields]{.underline}, such
as US--EU bilateral exchanges (examples of which include the Trade and
Technology Council and the Security and Defence Dialogue). [[Some member
states, primarily France, are determined to defend the EU's prerogatives
and are reluctant to see NATO go beyond its original
role]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The Russian inva- sion of Ukraine may help
in clarifying the respective roles played by NATO and the EU in European
security, as NATO is clearly refocusing on its core task of collective
defence, putting other issues on the backburner.]{.underline}

NATO in the Indo-Pacific

[NATO could free itself from its North Atlantic anchorage so that it can
contribute directly to military balancing efforts vis-à-vis China in the
Indo- Pacific]{.underline}. [The logic of this option is primarily
political: since China has become the priority of US security policy,
NATO, in order to remain attractive to the Americans, cannot avoid
updating its own priorities]{.underline}. Moreover, [European
allies]{.underline} are highly d[ependent]{.underline} commercially on
[sea lanes of communication]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific, notably
the Malacca Strait and the China Sea, and [therefore have an interest in
preventing Chinese hegemony]{.underline} in the region.

Not only would most [[European states]{.underline}]{.mark} be
hard-pressed to provide substantial military capabilities in East Asia,
the [vast majority [would be politically hostile to the idea of getting
involved militarily in the region through NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}.
French President Emmanuel Macron, for example, appeared to dismiss this
option when, just days before NATO's June 2021 Brussels Summit, he said,
'As far as I am concerned, China is not part of the Atlantic geography,
or there is something wrong with my map.'5 Some states, such as France
and Germany, are opposed to taking a belligerent stance against Beijing;
others, such as the Central and Eastern European countries, while often
eager to meet US expectations, want to preserve NATO's focus on the
Russian threat. The United States is particularly attentive to this
issue, and [US diplomats]{.underline} have r[epeatedly stated that China
will not draw attention away]{.underline} from other security challenges
within the Alliance. [The war in Ukraine has reaffirmed the importance
of collective defence against Russian actions, for example.6 Rather than
contrasting the risks posed by Russia with those posed by China,
Washington emphasises their concomitance, and the need to strengthen
solidarity among transatlantic and trans-Pacific allies]{.underline}.7
This concomitance was illustrated by the Sino-Russian joint statement of
4 February 2022, in which [both countries committed to deepening their
strategic partnership.8]{.underline}

In this context, [the [US does not seem genuinely interested in redefin-
ing the Alliance's geographic priorities]{.mark}, but rather wishes to
emphasise the implications of Chinese actions for security and stability
in the North Atlantic area]{.underline}. While Washington would like to
see better oversight of allies' various freedom-of-navigation operations
in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the China Sea, [[NATO involvement
is not seen as a priority]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Finally, [the [recent launch of the AUKUS]{.mark} partnership by
Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States [illustrates an
American preference for ad hoc military coalitions in the Indo-Pacific
rather than NATO mobi- lisation]{.mark}]{.underline}.9 [[For the US,
NATO allies are second-tier partners when it comes to
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. The top priority is cooperation with
regional actors, particularly Australia and Japan. In this context, [[US
expectations are limited to possible support from European allies for
partnerships or initiatives that would be led and driven by the
Indo-Pacific powers.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### NATO Impact: China---No Resource Tradeoff

A transatlantic division of strategic responsibilities

A third option would be to [acknowledge the transatlantic gap in terms
of threat perceptions and geostrategic priorities]{.underline}. [If
China is the main adver- sary of the United States while remaining
merely a 'challenge' for European partners focused on more immediate
threats, why not divide strategic responsibilities between the US and
its European allies]{.underline}? American forces, especially US
maritime and air forces, would focus more on the Indo-Pacific, [while
Europeans would strengthen their capabilities to ensure the security of
their own region]{.underline}. In this way, [Europe would contribute to
American efforts in the Asia-Pacific by making it easier for Washington
to free up capabilities and accelerate its 'pivot' towards
Asia.]{.underline} Similar solutions have been mooted since 2014, when
NATO was simultaneously confronted with the Russian threat to the east
and the terrorist threat to the south.15

For the United States, '[rebalancing the strategic burden' in this way
implies that the European states will take on greater responsibility
within NATO while the US places limits on its contributions to European
securi- ty.]{.underline}16 Thus, the Biden administration's Interim
National Security Strategic Guidance, released in March 2021, encourages
allies 'to invest in their own comparative advantages against shared
current and future threats'.17 However, [the [Biden administration
refuses to talk about a division of labour]{.mark} because it does not
consider transatlantic cooperation to be a zero-sum game.]{.underline}
[While competition with China may require a rethinking of US defence
priorities, it does not require an American withdrawal from
Europe.]{.underline} The Global Posture Review presented by the Pentagon
to President Joe Biden in November 2021 reinforces the US military
presence and capabilities in Europe, illustrating Washington's intention
to maintain a predominant role in the security of the continent.18 More
recently, President Biden reacted to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by
deploying additional troops from the United States to Europe. [[Neither
the White House nor Congress, which votes on the budgets of the
Pentagon's European Deterrence Initiative, have questioned the benefits
of the United States' commitment to Europe.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Moreover, many Central and Eastern European member states would see any
policy that would facilitate, even indirectly, the departure of American
troops from Europe as disastrous. More generally, [[European allies
would be unable to replace US capabilities on the continent in the
immediate future]{.underline}]{.mark}.19 Above all, the very logic of a
division of labour seems contra- dictory to that of an alliance: if
allies act separately in pursuit of distinct, albeit complementary,
objectives, can their efforts still be characterised as collective? In
the long run, does this approach not risk undermining the foundations of
Article 5, according to which an attack against one member is an attack
against all?

Research into the psychology of control has revealed that control needs
are key elements of individual psychological functioning. **[This
paper]{.underline}** argues that a "need for control'' framework is also
useful for understanding actions and ideologies at the national and
international levels. It **[critically analyzes prevalent strategies for
exerting control]{.underline}** in this domain **[and proposes
alternative strategies which permit greater fulfillment of control
needs]{.underline}**. **[These [alternatives emerge from an
examination]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark}
potential **[[similarities]{.mark} [between satisfaction of]{.mark}
control [needs]{.mark} with[in]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[separate
but parallel]{.mark} domains]{.underline}** **[of [international]{.mark}
relations [and interpersonal relations]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Political psychology has]{.mark} the [potential to translate]{.mark}
[issues]{.mark} of [i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations]{.underline}** **[[into]{.mark} the [terms of human
interpersonal encounte]{.mark}r]{.underline}**. In my view,
**[[such]{.mark} a translation [enhances our ability to think
creatively]{.mark}]{.underline}** about the current world situation. The
**[[students in my]{.underline}]{.mark}** freshman psychology
**[[course]{.underline}]{.mark}** recently surprised me by adopting this
approach for an in-class assignment. **[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}** had
[**[asked]{.underline}** **[them to role-play]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[a [negotiating]{.mark} session [between the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} the [Soviet Union on]{.mark} the issue of
[arms control]{.mark}]{.underline}**. My assumption had been that they
would act out the roles of political leaders on both sides, and would
proceed by exchanging official positions on arms control issues.
Instead, **[[they took the view]{.mark}point [of]{.mark} ordinary
Ameri-can and Soviet [citizens]{.mark} and exchanged candid
remarks]{.underline}** concerning their feelings about the nuclear
danger. Their tone of earnest sincerity was in stark contrast to the
kind of elaborate posturing, deceitfulness, and strategic "positioning"
that usually characterizes this kind of endeavor at the diplomatic
level. Having translated the arms race into its smallest constituent
parts---the feelings of individual Soviet and American citizens---they
had stripped away the layers of pretense and revealed the rigidly
arbitrary nature of their country's "party line." After the role-play
had ended, the students pressed me to admit that, if the political and
military leaders on both sides were removed from the picture, much of
the current conflict between the two countries could be settled by a
consensus of common citizens from both sides. It only occurred to me
later that, regardless of the practicality of their solution, my class
had arrived at it by a highly unusual means: **[[They]{.mark} had
[asserted]{.mark} that the [problems were amenable to human control by
acknowledging]{.mark} their own [individual human reactions to]{.mark}
the dangers of continued [international
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I choose to focus here not on the
solution my students proposed but on the impulse behind their proposal.
The need expressed by these students to render these issues
"controllable" in some fashion is a basic one. Perhaps an examination of
this need, and the more vs. less healthy ways it can be satisfied, holds
the key to a novel approach to international relations. The concept of a
"need for control" has recently received much attention within the field
of psychology. The belief that one can exercise control over one's
outcomes is said to be critical to psychological well-being (Glass and
Singer, 1972; Langer, 1983; Seligman, 1975; Wortman and Brehm, 1975).
Research has shown that the negative consequences of a stressful event
on physical and mental health can be overcome by a sense of
control---i.e., a belief in one's ability to cope with (respond
effectively to) the event (Anderson, 1982; Langer and Rodin, 1976;
Perlmuter and Monty, 1979; Weiss, 1972). The accumulating body of
research in this area has promising applications for the restoration and
maintenance of psychological health in a wide range of human
environmental settings. To date, feelings of control have been studied
as an attribute of individual psychological functioning. However, the
recent work of Fred Rothbaum and John Weisz and their colleagues
(Rothbaum et al., 1982; Weisz et al., 1984) suggests that a "need for
control" analysis may also be useful for understanding the functioning
of individual nations within the international arena. Rothbaum et al.
distinguish between primary and secondary forms of control. Primary
control is the ability to enhance one's rewards by doing something to
influence existing realities (e.g., other people, circumstances). In
secondary control, rewards are obtained by accommodating to existing
realities and maximizing satisfaction with things as they are. In other
words, people attempt to gain control not only by bringing the
environment into line with their wishes (primary control) but also by
bringing themselves into line with environmental forces (secondary
control). Weisz et al. argue that cultures differ in the extent to which
they emphasize primary vs. secondary forms of control. They conclude
that the proper relation between the two forms of control involves a
dynamic interplay between them, and warn that too heavy an emphasis on
either primary or secondary control may be maladaptive for cultures as
well as individuals. Extending the logic of Weisz et al. to the realm of
international relations, it can be assumed that **[[citizens and
policymakers alike define]{.mark} the [requirements of national
self-interest in]{.mark} somewhat [the same terms they use to
evaluate]{.mark} their own [individual]{.mark} sense of
[well-being]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, there is widespread
agreement that a key element of a "healthy" American psyche is a sense
of national potency ("primary control," in our terms) in the
international arena. Ronald Reagan's Presidency has been lauded by both
supporters and detractors for its "restoration" of this sense of control
after the "humiliating" decade of the 1970s---a legacy of Vietnam, the
oil embargo, and the Iranian hostage crisis (cf. Yankelovich, 1982).
Whether or not such a felt sense of control (or lack of same) would be
sustained by an objective appraisal, it is nonetheless real if it has
real consequences for domestic political priorities and foreign policy
actions. Given the present context of international relations, is an
enhanced sense of control by one nation purchased at the expense of
diminished control by other nations? \[The Weisz et al. analysis does
not attempt to address this key issue.\] Under what conditions can this
zero-sum notion of control be overcome? If the attainment of a sense of
control is indeed an important objective within the world community,
then these questions are critical. **[The answer may lie in exploring
alternative strategies for attaining [primary
control]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For example, **[the prevailing strategy
requires nations to maximize their power vis a vis potential
adversaries]{.underline}**. **[Yet the sense of control thus attained
[is always tenuous]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[because]{.underline}** (a)
**[the tech]{.underline}**nological **[basis for
maintaining]{.underline}** such **[relative power may be eclipsed by
breakthroughs]{.underline}** on the other side, (b) such technology is
subject to dissemination to third parties, thus diluting the power of
its former owners, and (c) power that involves the domination of one
nation by another (either directly or through surrogates) is bound to be
resisted by those subject peoples whose own needs for control have been
thwarted. Numerous examples attest to the existence of these needs
(under the guise of "nationalism" and "self-determination" or
"revolution" and "rebellion"---depending on the orientation of the
describer) as a continued source of frustration for the great powers in
their attempts to maintain the stability of client states. **[Faced with
these difficulties of asserting primary control, both [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} the [Soviet Union have come
to rely]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark}]{.underline}** a form of secondary
control that Weisz et al. refer to as **[[interpretive
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This is [the attempt to interpret
events]{.mark} so as [to derive]{.mark} a sense of [meaning]{.mark} and
purpose from them]{.underline}**. In the current great power struggle,
**[[this assumes the form of rigidly ideological beliefs about
the]{.mark} nature of the ["other side'']{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[necessity of continued struggle]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[It allows
individual persons and actions to be subsumed under a "grand scheme"
of]{.mark} impersonal global forces]{.underline}** (e.g., **[["good" vs.
"evil"]{.underline}]{.mark}**). The interpretive route to control works
to the extent that it provides a reassuring sense of order and
predictability. However, **[[this]{.mark} [unifying vision is purchased
at]{.mark} the [expense of]{.mark} an [empirically based analysis of
what the rest of the world is doing and why]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Reality]{.mark} [is distorted]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[to fit the
dichotomy of rightness]{.underline}**]{.mark} (on one's own behalf)
**[[vs. transgression]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The selective "management"
of information about foreign policy successes vs. failures is essential
to this enterprise \[the U.S. invasion of Grenada provides a recent
example; see e.g., Middleton (1984) and Nelson (1983)\]. Unfortunately,
such selective information-gathering seriously impairs foreign policy.
Numerous authors have described occasions on which great powers have
become the captives of their own over-simplified world views (e.g.,
Didion, 1983; Tuchman, 1984; Sick, 1985). Extended use of this secondary
control strategy requires a blurring of the distinction between
international politics and fiction. The Soviet Union does not enjoy a
monopoly in this regard. Within the last year, the Vietnam War veteran
has been resurrected as an American hero, and American audiences have
eagerly imbibed his cinematic revenge against the North Vietnamese in
"Rambo," "Missing in Action," and their television counterparts. A
related phenomenon is the president's identification with the on-screen
personas of fellow actors Clint Eastwood and Sylvester Stallone, whose
adherence to simplified credos belie the gnawing complexities of value
choices in the real world. Such reactions are likely not unique to
Americans or to their current president. Instead, they are symptomatic
of the frustrations incurred by nations who have failed in their
attempts to exert active control over world events. The control needs
themselves are legitimate; the strategies that are currently employed
for satisfying those needs are not. Use of such measures guarantees that
the cycle will repeat itself---i.e., that unrealistic thinking and
erroneous judgment will serve as the basis for future foreign policy
actions. The question remains: If the nations of the world cannot afford
continued reliance on such an ineffective (and unbalanced) "mix" of
control strategies, what are the alternatives? As suggested above, the
answer lies in exploring alternative conceptions of "control." Rather
than conceiving of control as a subject-object relationship, in which
the "object" is a fixed quantity (of land, resources, subject
populations) to be apportioned among contending powers, one could
instead consider it in the context of a subject-subject relationship, a
dy-namic system in which control needs are realized by the exercise of
mutual influence. **[[An analogy between]{.mark} the realms of
[international]{.mark} relations [and interpersonal relations]{.mark}
may serve to [illustrate this]{.mark} distinction]{.underline}**. **[In
[a personal relationship that is subject-object-based]{.mark},
[each]{.mark} party [has]{.mark} a [mutually exclusive]{.mark} sphere of
[self-interest]{.mark}]{.underline}** ("turf") **[to be
protected]{.underline}**; **[[the relationship must be negotiated
on]{.mark} the basis of [how much turf each]{.mark} party [will
cede]{.mark} to the other in exchange for similar
consideration]{.underline}**. **[A [failure of negotiation]{.mark} may
[lead to unilateral attempts]{.mark} by either/both parties to grab some
of the other's turf]{.underline}**. **["[Compromise" and
"confrontation"]{.mark} thus [define]{.mark} the parameters of
[this]{.mark} type of [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[Alternatively, a personal relationship may be
subject-subject-based]{.mark}, to the extent that [the relationship is
not]{.mark} primarily [directed toward]{.mark} the issue of [sharing vs.
hoarding]{.mark}]{.underline}** (of a separate domain of self-interest)
**[[but]{.mark} rather toward a [redefinition of self and
self-interest]{.mark} in terms of the relationship]{.underline}**.
**[Satisfaction]{.underline}** in such a relationship is not derived
from the amount of turf seized from, or conceded by, the other party.
Instead it **[obtains from the opportunity to exert positive influence
over the other's outcomes]{.underline}**, and in turn to be the
beneficiary of the other's positive consideration and favorable regard
(cf. Kelley, 1979; Kelley and Thi-baut, 1978).

#### Policy simulation is good -- promotes action and can't solve without politics

**Hodson 10** \[Derek, professor of education -- Ontario Institute for
Studies @ University of Toronto, "Science Education as a Call to
Action," Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology
Education, Vol. 10, Issue 3, p. 197-206\]

**[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** final (fourth) level of sophistication in
this issues-based [**[approach is concerned with students findings ways
of putting their values and convictions into action, helping them to
prepare for and engage in responsible action, and assisting them in
developing the skills]{.underline}**,]{.mark} attitudes, and values
[**[that will enable them to]{.underline}**]{.mark} take control of
their lives, [**[cooperate with others to bring about
change]{.underline}**, **[and work toward a more just and sustainable
world in which power, wealth, and resources are more equitably
shared.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Socially and environmentally responsible
behavior will not necessarily follow from knowledge of key concepts and
possession of the "right attitudes." As Curtin (1991) reminded us, it is
important to distinguish between caring about and caring for. It is
almost always much easier to proclaim that one cares about an issue than
to do something about it. Put simply, our values are worth nothing until
we live them. Rhetoric and espoused values will not bring about social
justice and will not save the planet. We must change our actions. A
[**[politicized ethic of care]{.underline}** (]{.mark}caring for)
**[[entails active involvement in]{.underline}]{.mark}** a local
manifestation of **[[a particular problem or issue, exploration of the
complex sociopolitical contexts in which the
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**/issue **[[is located, and attempts to
resolve conflicts of interest]{.mark}.]{.underline}** FROM STSE RHETORIC
TO SOCIOPOLITICAL ACTION Writing from the perspective of environmental
education, **[Jensen]{.underline}** (2002) **[categorized [the
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}** that is **[[likely to promote
sociopolitical action]{.underline}]{.mark}** and encourage
pro-environmental behavior **[into four dimensions]{.underline}**: (a)
**[scientific and technological knowledge]{.underline}** **[that informs
the issue]{.underline}** or problem; (b) **[knowledge about the
underlying social, political, and economic issues]{.underline}**,
conditions, **[and structures]{.underline}** and how they contribute to
creating social and environmental problems; (c) **[knowledge about how
to bring about changes]{.underline}** in society through direct or
indirect action; **[and]{.underline}** (d) **[knowledge about the likely
outcome or direction of possible actions and the desirability of those
outcomes.]{.underline}** Although formulated as a model for
environmental education, it is reasonable to suppose that Jensen\'s
arguments are applicable to all forms of SSI-oriented action. Little
needs to be said about dimensions 1 and 2 in Jensen\'s framework beyond
the discussion earlier in the article. With regard to dimension 3,
**[students need knowledge of actions that are likely to have positive
impact and knowledge of how to engage in them.]{.underline}** **[[It is
essential that they gain robust knowledge of the social, legal, and
political system(s)]{.underline}]{.mark}** that prevail in the
communities in which they live [**[and develop a clear understanding
of]{.underline}** [how **decisions**]{.underline} are **[made
within]{.underline}**]{.mark} local, regional, and **[national
[government]{.mark}]{.underline}** and within [**[industry, commerce,
and the military. Without knowledge of where and with whom power of
decision making is located and awareness of the mechanisms by which
decisions are reached]{.underline}**, **[intervention is not
possible]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** Thus, **[the
curriculum I propose requires]{.underline}** a concurrent program
designed to achieve a measure of **[political literacy, including
knowledge of how to engage in]{.underline}** collective **[action with
individuals who have different competencies, backgrounds, and
attitudes]{.underline}** but share a common interest in a particular
SSI. Dimension 3 also includes knowledge of likely sympathizers and
potential allies and strategies for encouraging cooperative action and
group interventions. What Jensen did not mention but would seem to be a
part of dimension 3 knowledge is the nature of **[science-oriented
knowledge]{.underline}** that **[would enable students to appraise the
statements, reports, and arguments of scientists, politicians, and
journalists and to present their own supporting or opposing arguments in
a coherent, robust, and convincing way]{.underline}** (see Hodson
\[2009b\] for a lengthy discussion of this aspect of science education).
Jensen\'s fourth category includes awareness of how (and why) others
have sought to bring about change and entails formulation of a vision of
the kind of world in which we (and our families and communities) wish to
live. It is important for students to explore and develop their ideas,
dreams, and aspirations for themselves, their neighbors and families and
for the wider communities at local, regional, national, and global
levels---a clear overlap with futures studies/education. **[[An
essential step in cultivating the critical scientific and technological
literacy on which sociopolitical action depends is the application of a
social and political critique]{.underline}]{.mark}** capable of
challenging the notion of technological determinism. We can control
technology and its environmental and social impact. More significantly,
**[we can]{.underline}** control the controllers and **[redirect
technology in such a way that adverse environmental impact is
substantially reduced]{.underline}** (**[if not]{.underline}** entirely
**[eliminated]{.underline}**) **[and issues of freedom, equality, and
justice are kept in the forefront of discussion during the establishment
of policy]{.underline}**.

#### Scholarship and practice can be co-constitutive -- ivory tower can be emprically broken down with policymaking experience

**Bertucci et al 2014** (Mariano, \[fellow @ Center for Inter-American
Policy and Research @ Tulane University\], Fabián Borges-Herrero
\[Assistant Professor of Political Science at CSUSB\], Claudia
Fuentes-Julio \[faculty @ institute of international relations @
Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro\], Toward "Best
Practices" in Scholar--Practitioner Relations: Insights from the Field
of Inter-American Affairs, *International Studies Perspectives*, 15.1,
accessed 7-15-2019, GDI-ATN)

[The literature on scholar--practitioner interactions in International
Relations (IR) is dominated by a sense of chasm]{.underline}.2
[Practitioners generally conceive scholarly outputs as abstract
discussions specifically tailored to satisfy the intellectual demands of
other scholars rather than responding to the pressing issues
policymakers must deal with on a daily basis.]{.underline} Many
scholars, in turn, disdain the oversimplifications and lack of
analytical rigor they often attribute to policy officials. IR is often
described as a self-regulated field in which professional success
depends almost entirely on one's reputation among peers. In this field,
there is a strong incentive to produce highly specialized and
methodologically rigorous research because this type of work, as opposed
to teaching or public service, is what a scholar's career advancement is
predicated on. Hence, IR scholars focus on generating novel arguments
that will impress other scholars, rather than policymakers.
Policymakers, on their part, want to know how events occur and pursue
knowledge specific to the policy process, that is, about what policy
levers to activate in order to shape outcomes in the desired direction,
as opposed to knowing why events occur and producing general
explanations that abstract from the workings of policy processes (George
1993; Kruzel 1994; Lepgold and Nincic 2001; Jentleson 2002; Walt 2005;
Nau 2008; Nye 2008a; Krasner 2011). [This perceived gap, according to
some observers, is growing larger. Even though there have been several
examples of how the study of international relations could and did
contribute useful insights to foreign policy practitioners]{.underline}
(e.g., research on nuclear strategy and arms control was widely used by
U.S. policymakers during the Cold War and research on "democratic peace
theory"---that democracies do not fight each other---has recently
entered popular discourse and also shaped policy in the United States),
[these contributions have allegedly become more scarce as IR scholars
increasingly turn to theoretical models that only qualified insiders can
penetrate and that policymakers consider irrelevant]{.underline} (Nye
2008a:654). [Missing from the literature on scholar--practitioner
interactions in IR is a more systematic focus on the experience of those
trained social scientists with professional trajectories as such that
have often played important roles in government]{.underline}.3 **[The
experience of these "in-and-outers" suggests that the gap might not be
as wide as it may seem]{.underline}**. In the field of Inter-American
affairs, for example, scholars both in Latin America and in North
America often have access to policymaking as direct as those of business
interests.4 Two of the most influential Latin American presidents of the
last 30 years, Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil and Ricardo Lagos of
Chile, have social science PhDs. President Rafael Correa of Ecuador has
a PhD in Economics. Three of the last four Mexican presidents--- Carlos
Salinas, Ernesto Zedillo, and Felipe Caldero´n---have had graduate
training in the social sciences. Most Latin American Finance Ministers
and Central Bank presidents in recent years have PhDs in Economics. Some
of the bestknown Latin American foreign policy practitioners of recent
years---former Foreign Ministers Jorge G. Castan˜eda of Mexico and Celso
Lafer of Brazil, as well as Mexico's late Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos
Rico, and Professor Marco Aure´lio Garcia of Brazil, personal foreign
policy advisor to Presidents Lula and Dilma Rousseff---came from
academia. Chile, which has had one of the most noteworthy international
policies in recent years, has relied heavily on social scientists:
former Foreign Ministers Jose´ Miguel Insulza (now Secretary General of
the Organization of American States), Ignacio Walker and Juan Gabriel
Valde´s; former Deputy Foreign Ministers Angel Flisfisch and Heraldo
Mun˜oz (now head of the United Nations Development Program's Regional
Bureau for Latin America), for example (Lowenthal 2010).

These [[government]{.underline}]{.mark} or quasi-government think tank
[**[simulations]{.mark}** often [provide]{.mark}]{.underline} very
similar [[**lessons** for]{.underline}]{.mark} high-level players as are
learned by **[[students]{.underline}]{.mark}** in educational
simulations. Government [[participants learn]{.mark} about [the
**importance** of]{.mark} **understanding [foreign
perspectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the need to practice internal
coordination, [[and the **necessity** to **compromise**]{.mark} **and
coordinate**]{.underline} with other governments in negotiations and
crises. During the Cold War, political scientist Robert Mandel noted how
**[crisis [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}** and war games
[[forced]{.underline}]{.mark} government [officials to overcome
''bureaucratic myopia]{.underline},'' moving beyond their normal
organizational roles and thinking more creatively about how others might
react in a crisis or conflict. [The **skills of [imagination]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the subsequent [ability to predict]{.mark} **foreign
interests and [reactions]{.mark}** [remain critical for]{.mark}
**real-world foreign [policy makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example,
simulations of the Iranian nuclear crisis\*held in 2009 and 2010 at the
Brookings Institution's Saban Center and at Harvard University's Belfer
Center, and involving former US senior officials and regional
experts\*highlighted the dangers of misunderstanding foreign
governments' preferences and misinterpreting their subsequent behavior.
In both simulations, the primary criticism of the US negotiating team
lay in a failure [[to **predict**]{.mark} **accuratel[y]{.mark}**
[how]{.mark} **other [states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, both
[**[allies]{.mark} and adversaries**[, would behave **in response** to
**US policy**]{.mark} **initiatives**.]{.underline} [[By
**university**]{.mark} **age**[, students]{.mark}]{.underline} often
[[have a]{.mark} **pre-defined [view]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
**international [affairs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the literature on
simulations in education has long emphasized how such [[exercises
**force students** to challenge]{.mark} **their [assumptions]{.mark}**
[about how]{.mark} other [governments **behave** and]{.mark} how their
own government [work]{.mark}s]{.underline}. Since simulations became
more common as a teaching tool in the late 1950s, educational literature
has expounded on their benefits, from encouraging engagement by breaking
from the typical lecture format, to improving communication skills, to
promoting teamwork. More broadly, [**[simulations]{.mark}** can [deepen
**understanding** by asking **students** to link **fact and
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}, providing a context for facts while
bringing theory into the realm of practice. These exercises are
particularly valuable in teaching international affairs for many of the
same reasons they are useful for policy makers: [they force
**[participants]{.mark}** to [''grapple with]{.mark} the issues arising
from **[a world in flux.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Simulations have been
used successfully to teach students about such disparate topics as
European politics, the Kashmir crisis, and US response to the mass
killings in Darfur. Role-playing [[exercises]{.underline}]{.mark}
certainly [[encourage **students** to learn **political**]{.mark} **and
technical [facts]{.mark}**]{.underline}\* but they learn them [[in
a]{.mark} **more [active style]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Rather than
sitting in a classroom and merely receiving knowledge, [students
actively research]{.underline} ''their'' government's positions
[and]{.underline} actively [argue]{.underline}, brief, and negotiate
with others. Acts can change quickly; [[**simulations** teach]{.mark}
students [how to]{.mark} **contextualize and [act]{.mark}** [on
info]{.mark}rmation.]{.underline}

### Cede the Political

#### Applying theory to action is key -- otherwise we cede the political to insider technopols.

**Bertucci et al 2014** (Mariano, \[fellow @ Center for Inter-American
Policy and Research @ Tulane University\], Fabián Borges-Herrero
\[Assistant Professor of Political Science at CSUSB\], Claudia
Fuentes-Julio \[faculty @ institute of international relations @

Practices" in Scholar--Practitioner Relations: Insights from the Field
of Inter-American Affairs, *International Studies Perspectives*, 15.1,
accessed 7-15-2019, GDI-ATN)

Inter-American affairs are marked by a stark dichotomy. On the one hand,
**[there are close relations among a considerable number of scholars and
policymakers, and especially the emergence of "technopols" who move back
and forth between academia and politics]{.underline}** (e.g., Domı´nguez
1997). On the other hand, [a much smaller number of scholars focus on
theoretical issues without addressing explicit policy
concerns,]{.underline} thus adhering to the pattern that characterizes
most other subfields in Political Science. **[A third group, prominent
in U.S. and in Canadian academia, shuns any involvement with
policymakers but approaches the issues from a politically committed
anti-establishment position.]{.underline}** Even though many scholars
and practitioners in the field of Inter-American affairs have had
considerable experience with each other, some scholars have become
practitioners, and some practitioners have re-entered academia, the
fruits of their interaction have on the whole not been substantial.
[Scholars have often been critical of U.S. and Canadian practitioners
for their failure to rigorously disaggregate among country
experiences]{.underline}; flawed policymaking by misleading analogy; and
loose conceptualization of such processes as democracy promotion,
populism, and the rule of law. [Few social scientists, on the other
hand, have been able and willing to apply rigorous analyses and
methodologies to policy issues. Policy officials working on
Inter-American affairs often lament the lack of policy relevance of
academic theorizing. Scholars and practitioners in this field tend to
talk past each other, with little impact in either
direction.]{.underline}

### Methodological Pluralism

#### **IR theory should embrace a plurality of approaches -- best prevents bad policy and IR theory**

**Zambernardi 2015** (Lorenzo, University of Bologna, Italy, "Politics
is too important to be left to political scientists: A critique of the
theory--policy nexus in International Relations," European Journal of
International Relations, 8/15/15, LibGen.io accessed 7/13/19 GDI-JEM)

I am not sure if these arguments support Feyerabend's (1975) maxim that
'anything goes', but [they certainly support the epistemological and
political liberal view that plu-ralism must flourish]{.underline}.
Hence, **[theoretical and methodological diversity should be
encour-aged.]{.underline}** [The only acceptable and healthy protection
from poor IR theory and]{.underline}, most importantly, f[rom bad policy
is not the silencing of particular approaches or the conver-gence
towards a particular methodology, but a mutual criticism that avoids
ending up in intellectual standardization.]{.underline} Although a
dialectic link between theory and practice should characterize the
interaction between the two, the relationship should not be resolved in
terms of synthesis. In other words, the gap between scholarship and
policymaking is not to be bridged. [IR theorists' public
duty]{.underline} --- starting and contributing to public debates ---
[can be better developed when scholars are aware that they have no
demiurgic rol]{.underline}e (Panebianco, 1999). Whether scholars are
naturalists or not, [the most important contribution that IR theorists
can make to foreign policy and international politics is neither to
'speak truth to power]{.underline}' (Morgenthau, 1966; Wallace, 1996)
[nor to 'discipline power with truth']{.underline} (Krasner, 1996: 125),
[but rather discipline power with a variety of truths and encourage the
self-educa-tion of practitioners]{.underline}. These are the two main
functions that IR theory can perform for policymaking. Whether these
arguments are applicable to political science more generally is an issue
that has not been debated here and that is left open for discussion by
other scholars in their respective intellectual domains.

#### **Multitude of approaches good -- allows for greater debate among academics and more comprehensive analysis of consequences**

**Zambernardi 2015** (Lorenzo, University of Bologna, Italy, "Politics
is too important to be left to political scientists: A critique of the
theory--policy nexus in International Relations," European Journal of
International Relations, 8/15/15, LibGen.io accessed 7/13/19 GDI-JEM)

[Debates and disputes regarding international affairs have the great
advantage of ensuring that rival explanations and policy advice can be
taken into account for each problem]{.underline} (Panebianco, 1999):
'The role of scientific research and analysis is therefore not the
heroic one of providing truths by which policy may be guided, but the
ironic one of preventing policy being formulated around some technical
conclusions' (Collingridge and Reeve, 1986: 32). Indeed, [while the
general public is very likely to ignore academic debates, there is
strong evidence that policymakers follow research and scholarship on
international affairs on a regular basis]{.underline} (Avey and Desch,
2014: 229). I am not arguing that different theories freely compete in
the marketplace of ideas. Nor do I support the claim that theoretical
competition is a key requirement for the growth of political knowledge.
As we all know well, [the settlement of political disputes in the public
arena is rarely based only on the quality of the argument proposed, but
also often on the values and the political and economic power behind
those arguing]{.underline}. In the political arena, [arguments rarely
confront each other in a fair manner with the purpose of reaching truth
and improving understanding.]{.underline} Actually, [they are often used
as ammunition for political competition.]{.underline} [Theoretical
proliferation, the clash of competing arguments and mutual criticism can
neither ensure that the best theories will survive nor prevent major
mistakes, but they can avoid errors becoming uncontested truths. The
positive contribution of IR]{.underline}, then, [results not from the
intentions and purposes of single political scientists, but rather from
the involuntary effects of all scholars' contribu-tions.]{.underline}
Although social scientists are aware of unintended consequences on
political real-ity (Boudon, 1977; Merton, 1936), they seem to forget
that they are part of the same reality they are studying and that, as
social individuals, they produce unintended effects too. The paradox is
that the work of scholars plays this ironic role especially when
theo-rists disagree about the decisions to be made (Panebianco, 1999).
As Ralf Dahrendorf (1968: 240, 247) maintained, the: only adequate
response to the human condition of uncertainty \... is the necessity of
maintaining a plurality of decision patterns, and an opportunity for
them to interact and compete\.... Uncertainty demands variety and
competition \... and political conflict, and institutions that provide
suitable conditions for this conflict. In so doing, [**different
theories enable us to look at present and future conditions in
differ-ent ways** in all the three major stages of the policy
process]{.underline}: problem recognition, the formation and refining of
policy proposals, and politics (Kingdon, 1993).**[The existence of a
multitude of contradictory theories in the discipline should be seen not
as a problem, but rather as a positive and desirable
condition]{.underline}**. [Although pluralism tends to fragment the IR
community, only a scientist conception of political knowledge at can
regard theoretical diversity as a hindrance to healthy
policymaking]{.underline}. Thus, [a variety of approaches and methods is
beneficial not only for intellectual reasons]{.underline} (Mearsheimer
and Walt, 2013; Smith, 2004), [but for political reasons as well.
Indeed, 'critical debate is the sole adequate procedure in view of the
fundamental limitations on our knowledge']{.underline} (Dahrendorf,
1968: 251).

#### **Combination of theories key to avoid dogmatism -- allows best pursuit of better IR theory**

**Mearsheimer 2013** \[John J. and Stephen M., University of Chicago,
and Walt, Harvard University, "Leaving theory behind: Why simplistic
hypothesis testing is bad for International Relations," European Journal
of International Relations, 2013,
<https://mearsheimer.uchicago.edu/pdfs/Leaving%20Theory%20Behind%20EJIR.pdf>
accessed 7/14/19 GDI-JEM\]

[The study of IR should be approached with humility. There is no single
theory that makes understanding world politics easy, no magic
methodological bullet that yields robust results without
effort,]{.underline} and no search engine that provides mountains of
useful and relia-ble data on every question that interests us. **[We
therefore favor a diverse intellectual community where different
theories and research traditions coexist]{.underline}**. Given how
little we know, and how little we know about how to learn more,
[overinvesting in any particular approach seems unwise.]{.underline} As
Schrodt (2006: 336) wisely observes[, 'we need all the help we can get
to figure out this whacko world.']{.underline} What matters most,
however, is whether we create more powerful theories to explain key
features of IR[. Without good theories, we cannot trust our empirical
findings, whether quantitative or qualitative in nature. Unless we have
theories to make sense of them, we cannot even keep track of all the
hypotheses that scholars keep piling up. There are many roads to better
theory, but that should be our ultimate destination.]{.underline}

## Security Good

### 2AC Engagement Turn

#### Even if security and risk calculation are flawed, engaging in them creates discourse of social welfare and promotes a democratic civic culture that checks political exclusion and loss of value to life

**Loader & Walker 7** \[Ian, Criminology All Souls College @ Oxford
(England), Neil, Regius Professor of Public Law and the Law of Nature
and Nations @ Edinburgh Law. *Civilizing Security*. 5-18\]

Faced with such inhospitable conditions, [[one can]{.underline}]{.mark}
easily [[lapse into **fatalistic** despair]{.underline}]{.mark}, letting
events simply come as they will, [or]{.underline} else seek [refuge in
the consolations offered [by]{.mark} the total [critique of
securitization]{.mark}]{.underline} practices -- a path that some
critical scholars in criminology and security studies have found all too
seductive (e.g. Bigo 2002, 2006; Walters 2003).
[[Or]{.underline}]{.mark} one can, as we have done, [[supplement social
criticism with the]{.mark} hard, uphill, necessarily [**painstaking**
work of seeking to]{.mark} specify what it may mean for citizens to
**[live together securely with risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}[; [to think
about the]{.underline}]{.mark} [social and [political
arrangements]{.mark} capable of making this possibility
more]{.underline} rather than less [likely, and to]{.underline} do what
one can to [[nurture practices of **collective
security**]{.mark}]{.underline} shaped not by fugitive market power or
by the unfettered actors of (un)civil society, but by an inclusive,
democratic politics. [Social analysts]{.underline} of crime and security
[have]{.underline} become highly attuned to, and [warned repeatedly
of,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} illiberal, [exclusionary effects of
the association between security and political community]{.underline}
(Dillon 1996; Hughes 2007). They have not, it should be said, done so
without cause, for reasons we set out at some length as the book
unfolds. [But]{.underline} [this]{.underline} sharp
[sensitivity]{.underline} to the risks of thinking about security
through a communitarian lens [has itself come at a price]{.underline},
namely, that of [failing to address]{.underline} and theorize fully
[the]{.underline} virtues and [social benefits that can flow from
members of a political community being able to put and pursue security
in common]{.underline}. This, it seems to us, is a failure to heed the
implications of the stake that all citizens have in security; [to
appreciate the closer alignment of self-interest and altruism that can
attend the acknowledgement that [we are forced to
live]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Kant put it, [[inescapably
side-by-side]{.mark} and that [individuals simultaneously constitute and
threaten one another's security]{.mark}]{.underline}; and [to register
the security-enhancing significance and value of the affective bonds of
trust and abstract solidarity that political communities depend upon,
express and sustain.]{.underline} All this, we think, offers reasons to
believe that [[security]{.underline} [offers]{.underline}]{.mark} a
conduit, perhaps [[the best conduit]{.mark} there is, [for giving
**practical meaning** to]{.mark} the idea of [the **public
good**]{.mark}, for [**reinventing** **social democratic**
politics]{.mark},]{.underline} even [[for **renewing**]{.mark} **the
activity of [politics]{.mark}**]{.underline} at all. These, of course,
may prove to be naïve hopes, futile whistling in a cold and hostile
wind. It is in addition true that the project of civilizing security is
ultimately a question not of social theory but of political praxis. But
if such a project is ever to be thematized as a politics it requires, or
at least can be furthered by, some form of theoretical articulation; one
which reminds us, as C. L. R. James (1963) might have said, that those
who know only of security of security nothing know. It is with this
overarching purpose in mind that we have been moved to write in the way
that we have about security today. Our argument in this book is that
security is a valuable public good, a constitutive ingredient of the
good society, and that [[the democratic state has a necessary and
virtuous role to play]{.mark} in the production of this
good]{.underline}. The state, and in particular the forms of public
policing governed by [it, is]{.underline}, we shall argue,
[[indispensable]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} the task of
fostering and [[sustaining livable political
communities]{.mark}]{.underline} in the contemporary world. It is, in
the words of our title, pivotal to the project of civilizing security.
By invoking this phrase we have in mind two ideas, both of which we
develop in the course of the book. The first, which is relatively
familiar if not uncontroversial, is that [security needs
civilizing]{.underline}. States -- even those that claim with some
justification to be 'liberal' or 'democratic' -- have a capacity when
self-consciously pursuing a condition called 'security' to act in a
fashion injurious to it. So too do non-state 'security' actors, a point
we return to below and throughout the book. They proceed in ways that
trample over the basic liberties of citizens; that forge security for
some groups while imposing illegitimate burdens of insecurity upon
others, or that extend the coercive reach of the state -- and security
discourse -- over social and political life. As monopoly holders of the
means of legitimate physical and symbolic violence, modern states
possess a built-in, paradoxical tendency to undermine the very liberties
and security they are constituted to protect. Under conditions of fear,
such as obtain across many parts of the globe today, states and their
police forces are prone to deploying their power in precisely such
uncivil, insecurity instilling ways[. If the state is to perform the
ordering and solidarity nourishing work that we argue is vital to the
production of secure political communities then it must]{.underline},
consequently, [be connected to forms of discursive
contestation,]{.underline} democratic scrutiny [and]{.underline}
constitutional [control]{.underline}. The state is a great civilizing
force, a necessary and virtuous component of the good society. But if it
is to take on this role, the state must itself be civilized -- made safe
by and for democracy. [But]{.underline} our title also has another, less
familiar meaning -- the idea that security is civilizing. [Individuals
who live, objectively or subjectively, in a state of anxiety do not make
good democratic citizens]{.underline}, [as European theorists reflecting
upon the dark days of the 1930s and 1940s knew well]{.underline}
(Neumann 1957). [Fearful citizens tend to be]{.underline} inattentive
to, [unconcerned]{.underline} [about]{.underline}, even enthusiasts for,
[the erosion of basic freedoms.]{.underline} [They often lack
openness]{.underline} or sympathy [towards others]{.underline},
especially those they apprehend as posing a danger to them. [They
privilege the known over the unknown]{.underline}, us over them, here
over there. [They often retreat from public life, seeking refuge in
private security 'solutions' while at the same time screaming anxiously
and angrily from the sidelines for]{.underline} the firm hand of
[authority]{.underline} -- for [tough 'security']{.underline} measures
against crime, or disorder, or terror. [Prolonged episodes of
[violence]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [[can]{.mark} erode or
[destroy]{.mark} people's will and [capacity to exercise political
judgement and act in solidarity]{.mark} with others]{.underline} (Keane
2004: 122--3). Fear, in all these ways, is the breeding ground, as well
as the stock-in-trade, of authoritarian, uncivil government. But there
is more to it than that. Security is also civilizing in a further, more
positive sense. [[Security]{.underline}]{.mark}, we shall argue, is in a
sociological sense a 'thick' public good, one whose production has
irreducibly social dimensions, a good that [[helps]{.mark} to
[constitute the]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[idea of
'publicness']{.underline}]{.mark}. [Security]{.underline}, in other
words, [is simultaneously the producer and product of forms of trust and
abstract solidarity between intimates and strangers that are
prerequisite to democratic political communities]{.underline}. [[The
state]{.mark}, moreover, performs vital cultural and ordering work in
fashioning the good of security conceived of in this sense]{.underline}.
[It [can]{.mark}, under the right conditions, [create inclusive
communities]{.mark} of practice and attachment, while ensuring that
these remain rights-regarding, diversity respecting
entities]{.underline}. [In a world where the state's pre-eminence in
governing security is being questioned by private-sector
interests]{.underline}, practices of local communal ordering and
transnational policing networks, [the constitution of old- and
new-fashioned forms of democratic political authority is, we shall
argue, indispensable to cultivating and sustaining the civilizing
effects of security]{.underline}. Security and its discontents Raising
these possibilities is, of course, to invite a whole series of obvious
but nonetheless significant questions: what is security? What does it
mean to be or to feel secure? Who or what is the proper object of
security -- individuals, collectivities, states, humanity at large? What
social and political arrangements are most conducive to the production
of security? It is also to join -- in a global age that is now also an
age of terror -- a highly charged political debate about the meanings
and value of security as a good, and about how it may best be pursued.
It is these questions, and this debate, that we want to address in this
book. Security has become the political vernacular of our times. This
has long been so in respect of 'law and order' within nation states.
Authoritarian regimes are routinely in the habit of using the promise
and rhetoric of security as a means of fostering allegiance and
sustaining their rule -- delivering safe streets while (and by) placing
their citizens in fear of the early morning knock at the door (Michnik
1998). Democratic societies too have over the last several decades come
to be governed through the prism of crime -- a phenomenon especially
marked in the USA, Britain and Australasia, though not without resonance
in other liberal democratic states (Garland 2001; Simon 2006; see also
Newburn and Sparks 2004). But security has also since 9/11, and the 'war
on terror' waged in response to it, become a pervasive and contested
element of world politics, impacting significantly on the 'interior'
life of states and international and transnational relations in ways, as
we shall see, that escalate the breakdown of once settled distinctions
between internal and external security, war and crime, policing and
soldiering (Kaldor 1999; Bigo 2000a). Today, security politics is riven
by disagreements over the pros and cons of self-consciously seeking
security using predominantly policing and military means; by disputes
about how and whether to 'balance' security with such other goods as
freedom, justice and democracy; and by conflicts between a conception of
security as protection from physical harm and wider formulations of
'human' or 'global' security. In the face of these debates we are aware
that the title and ambitions of this text are likely to meet with one of
three possible responses. They will be seen by some as offensive to the
benign intentions and purposes of governments and security actors. They
may be viewed, alternatively, as the naïve, wrong-headed pursuit of an
oxymoron. Or they may be dismissed -- by those who share our broad
ambition to civilize security -- as too limited in their grasp of what
the idea of security can and should mean. We want to probe a little
further into each of these anticipated reactions. In so doing, we can
begin to pinpoint the limitations of certain established dispositions
towards, and public discourses about, security, as well as indicating
how the debate about security can be moved to a different -- we think
more fruitful -- place.1 The first -- currently hegemonic -- response
issues from a lobby that seeks fairly unambiguously to promote security
and that takes exception to the idea that security needs civilizing.
Security, on this view, is an unqualified human good. The protection of
its people from internal and external threats stands consequently as the
first and defining priority of government. Far from needing to be
balanced with democratic rights and freedoms, security is a precondition
for the enjoyment of such goods. Far from needing 'civilizing', security
is the foundation stone and hallmark of civilization. Security,
moreover, can and should be directly and consciously pursued using what
Joseph Nye (2002) calls 'hard power' -- by enabling, resourcing and
enthusiastically backing the military, intelligence agencies and the
police. It is these agencies that will protect the state and its
citizens, and these agencies whose purposes and effectiveness must not
be hamstrung by excessive legal rights and safeguards that give succour
to the enemy, or by forms of democratic deliberation that obstruct
decisive executive action. This -- stripped to its essentials -- is the
discourse that has animated countless 'wars on drugs' and 'crackdowns'
on crime and disorder in both democratic and authoritarian states over
recent decades, and which since 9/11 has fuelled and justified what may
turn out to be a permanent 'war on terror'. This disposition towards,
and identification with, security has long antecedents dating back to
Jean Bodin and Thomas Hobbes, and is deeply sedimented in the present
(Robin 2004). It represents the clearsighted and hard-headed outlook of
a good many politicians and police officers. It holds -- for anxious
citizens -- a deep emotional allure. But it is not without some serious
shortcomings, two of which warrant an introductory note. It proceeds,
first of all, in ways that gloss over the paradoxes that attend the
pursuit of security (Berki 1986: ch. 1; Zedner 2003). It has little to
say, and rarely pauses to reflect upon, the most profound of these;
namely, that the state's concentration of coercive power makes it
simultaneously a guarantor of and a threat to the security of
individuals. Security, as Berki (1986: 13) puts it, is inescapably a
problem for and a problem of the state -- a condition we deal with more
fully in later chapters (see also N. Walker 2000: ch. 1). Nor does the
security lobby grasp clearly the implications of how human beings are
mutually implicated in one another's in/security -- as both an
everpresent potential threat to the security of each, and at the same
time a necessary precondition for giving effect to such security. Still
less does the security lobby register and absorb the fact that security
is, in an important sense, destined to remain beyond our grasp -- 'more
within us as a yearning, than without us as a fact' (Ericson and
Haggerty 1997: 85). Not only does this mean that there can never -- in a
paradox rich with implications -- be 'enough' security measures, which
hold out a promise of protection while always also signifying the
presence of threat and danger. It also warns us that responding to
demands for order in the terms in which they present themselves (i.e.
zero-tolerant police, tougher sentencing, more prisons, 'wars' against
drugs, or crime, or terror) can be little more than a bid to quench the
unquenchable. The effacing of paradoxes such as these is closely
connected to -- indeed a key contributor towards -- the second and most
deleterious shortcoming of the security lobby. This is its tendency to
make security pervasive, to proceed in ways that treat and thereby
produce 'security' -- or, more accurately, security rhetoric and
activity -- as a dominant, emotionally charged element of political
culture and everyday life. Security -- as Buzan et al. (1998) usefully
remind us -- is not only a condition of social existence, a description
of social relations marked by order and tranquillity. It is also a
political practice, a speech act, one way of framing and naming
problems. To call something 'security' -- to make what Buzan et al.
(1998: 25) call a 'securitizing move' -- is to suggest, and to seek to
mobilize audiences behind, the idea that 'we' face an existential threat
that calls for immediate, decisive, special measures. It is, in other
words, to seek to lift the issue at hand -- whether it is crime, or
drugs, or migration -- out of the realm of normal democratic politics,
to claim that as an emergency it demands an urgent, even exceptional,
response. The security lobby -- blessed as it invariably is with 'blind
credulity and passionate certainty' (Holmes 1993: 250) -- makes
precisely this move. It connects with and articulates public
insecurities about crime, or disorder, or terror in terms that
institutionalize anxiety as a feature of everyday life and link security
to a conception of political community organized around binary
oppositions between us/them, here/there, friends/enemies,
inside/outside. In encouraging 'emotional fusion between ruler and
ruled' around the question of fear (Holmes 1993: 49), it generates a
climate that inhibits -- even actively deters -- critical scrutiny of
the state's claims and practices. By translating security into Security,
into a matter of cops chasing robbers, soldiers engaging the enemy, it
risks fostering vicious circles of insecurity (atrocity -- fear -- tough
response -- atrocity -- fear -- and so on) that ratchet up police
powers, security technologies and their attendant rhetoric in ways that
it becomes difficult then to temper or dismantle. In all these ways, the
security lobby makes 'security' talk and action pervasive, or what we
shall call shallow and wide, reproducing 'security' on the surface of
social consciousness and rendering it dependent on the visible display
of executive authority and police power. In so doing, it fails to get
close to the heart of what it is that makes individuals objectively (or
intersubjectively) and subjectively secure -- it is unable, that is, to
understand, still less to create, the conditions under which security
becomes axiomatic, or deep and narrow. For us, these are vital
distinctions, ones that we revisit and develop as our argument unfolds.
The second response to our stated ambitions -- the one likely to regard
the enterprise as hopelessly misplaced -- is concerned above all to
counter security. This emanates from what we may call the 'liberty
lobby' which disputes the suggestion that security can be civilized.
Security, on this view, is a troubling, dangerous idea. Security
politics -- especially in the form we have just set out -- is seen as
authoritarian and potentially barbarous -- 'contrary to civil
well-being' (Keane 2004: 46). It is a politics that privileges state
interests (and conceptions of security) over those of individuals; that
is inimical to democratic values; that possesses a seductive capacity to
trample -- in the name, and with the support, of 'the majority' -- over
civil liberties and minority rights; that is, in short, conducive to the
very violence that it purports to stamp out. Security, consequently, is
something that must either be curbed in the name of liberty and human
rights or, given its close police and military associations, abandoned
as a value altogether. Let us briefly introduce two strands of this
critical disposition. The first -- common to human rights movements
across the globe -- seeks to constrain the power of security by
questioning its imperatives, and fencing in its demands, with an
insistence on protecting or enhancing the democratic freedoms and
individual rights that security politics is indifferent to, throws into
a utilitarian calculus, chips away at, or suspends. From this
standpoint, habeas corpus, access to legal advice, limits on detention
and police interrogative powers, jury trials, rights of appeal and the
like are the expression and tools of a desire to preserve a space for
individual liberty in the face of the forceful demands of an overweening
state and global state system -- whether in 'normal' or 'exceptional'
times.2 A second stance -- associated with those working under the loose
banner of '[critical security studies']{.underline} (Krause andWilliams
1997) -- deepens and radicalizes the impulse and insights of the first.
This [holds that security is irredeemably tainted by its police/military
parentage]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} by its [authoritarian desires
for certainty]{.underline}. On this view, security is a political
technology that must 'continue to produce images of insecurity in order
to retain its meaning' (A. Burke 2002: 18) in ways that make it, at a
conceptual level, inimical to democratic politics; or else it is a
practice deeply tarred by its intimate empirical relation to the
formation and reproduction of state-centric interests and xenophobic,
anti-democratic political subjectivities and collective identities (R.
B. J. Walker 1997). The conclusion in either case is the same. Security,
it is claimed, has to be abandoned, the dual analytical and political
task being to unsettle and deconstruct security as a category so as to
find ways of thinking and acting beyond it (Dillon 1996; Aradau 2004).
There is much of value in this critique of uncivil security -- a great
deal, in fact, which we are sympathetic towards. But [these [critical
stances]{.mark}]{.underline} also [share]{.underline} certain
[lacunae]{.underline}. [Each]{.underline}, in particular, expressly or
implicitly [intimates that security]{.underline} -- understood as being
and feeling free from the threat of physical harm -- is [a problem, a
conservative sensibility]{.underline} and project that is all too often
hostile to the values and institutional practices of democracy and
liberty (Huysmans 2002). [The result is that each [operates as a
**negative, oppositional force**,]{.mark} one [that **evacuates** the
terrain that the **security lobby**]{.mark} so [effectively and]{.mark}
affectively occupies [in favour of a stance that strives]{.mark} either
[to]{.mark} temper its worst excesses, or to trash and [banish the idea
altogether]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [a stance [that appeals]{.mark} in
part [because so few]{.mark} others [appear motivated to defend the
liberties which are being imperilled]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is, on
this view, little or no mileage in seeking to think in constructive
terms about the good of security and the kind of good that security is.
There is little point in fashioning a theory and praxis that explores
the positive -- democracy and liberty-enhancing -- ways in which
security and political community may be coupled; in reflecting upon what
it means, and might take, to make security axiomatic to lived social
relations. There can, in short, be no politics of civilizing security.
Proponents of the third -- 'human' or 'social security' -- response
share with us both a desire to transcend this received security--liberty
dichotomy and, in their own way, an ambition to civilize security. On
this view, however, such a project requires that security be rescued
from a taken-for-granted association with the 'threat, use and control
of military force' (Walt 1991: 212), and extended to other domains of
social and political life (e.g. de Lint and Virta 2004).3 We can
usefully highlight two variants of this position -- one international,
the other domestic. The former takes its cue from the United Nations
Human Development Report 1994, which introduced, and sought to mobilize
opinion behind, the concept of 'human security', an idea which has
subsequently been taken up in further work conducted under the auspices
of the United Nations and the European Union (Commission on Human
Security 2003; Barcelona Group 2004; cf. Paris 2001). It seeks to
decouple security from questions of war and peace and deploy it as a
device aimed at urging governments to treat as emergencies such chronic
threats as hunger, homelessness, disease and ecological degradation --
the latter, for instance, being described by the Commission on Global
Governance (1995: 83) as 'the ultimate security threat'. The domestic
version of the argument draws from the insight that there is no policing
or penal solution to the problem of order the conclusion that crime
control -- or harm reduction -- is ultimately a matter of, and dissolves
into, questions of economic and social policy more generally. This is a
commonly held disposition within both sociological criminology and
social democratic politics, one which has in recent years informed a
critique of situational crime prevention, crime science and other forms
of technocratic crime control, and underpinned the promotion of
multi-agency, social crime prevention (Crawford 1997; Hope and Karstedt
2003). On this view, security conceived of in a 'shallow' manner as
freedom from physical harm or threat is both inseparable from a more
profound sense of 'well-being' or 'ontological' security and, therefore,
also dependent upon the broader institutions and services of social
welfare (Fredman forthcoming). There is, once more, much to applaud in
this attempt to extend the meanings and application of the idea of
security. It reminds us that freedom from physical coercion is but a
part of any rounded conception of human flourishing. And it pinpoints
the limited and often counter-productive role that security politics and
policing institutions play within this wider project. But there are
difficultie

### 2AC AT Rejection Alt

#### Appeals to security are not necessarily "securitizing" -- critical approaches ignore situated practices that contest traditional security. We have to pragmatically evaluate it in each individual context

negative/positive debate," *Review of International Studies*,

Having clarified the different uses of these terms, I propose an
alternative approach to overcome these tensions, which I label [the
pragmatist frame]{.underline}. This brings the contributions of the
analytic and normative frames together, but [focuses on studying the
value of security in context.]{.underline} This focuses on how
[security]{.underline} is currently used by different actors, to
illustrate that it [can be, but isn't always, a 'good
thing'.]{.underline} Although there is not enough space to introduce a
fully-fledged new theoretical framework here, the final section is
devoted to exploring this further. Here I draw on the pragmatist
philosophy of Dewey and James, practice-centred approaches and
contextualism. Drawing on Ciută's argument that [security does not have
an unchanging 'essence' or meaning]{.underline}12, I suggest that [it
also has no inherent value]{.underline}: this has serious implications
for the negative/positive debate. [If the value of security is
contextual and unfixed, the focus should shift from defining what makes
security practices positive or negative in the abstract, to studying
actual situated security practices in context and using this to make
conclusions about the value of security in that particular
case.]{.underline} Reflexivity is essential here: such analysis has to
be accompanied by a shift from fixed normative commitments towards
normative awareness. This may in turn help practical analysis (and
critique) of existing notions of security and security policy. While
further research is needed, I hope this contribution will open space for
exploring a new way forward for understanding the value of security. The
paper's central contribution is thus to clarify the debate over the
value of security, drawing out the different uses of the terms
'negative' and 'positive' and proposing an alternative pragmatist route.
Because the focus here is on the debate over the value of security and
how security is currently used, it does not tackle the bigger question
of what or which issues should or shouldn't be constructed as security
issues, as this is beyond the scope of the paper. However, [studying the
ethics of security implies a normative approach, where the analyst/s is
recognised as 'active participants in the security
discussion']{.underline}13. The paper begins with a discussion on the
ethics of security, distinguishing between securitization and the
construction of security. It then examines the negative/positive debate,
drawing out the analytic and normative frames in the key contributions
on the topic. Lastly, it develops the pragmatist frame drawing on these
uses and building on them to create a pragmatic, contextual and
practice-centred understanding of the value of security. The final
section discusses the implications. Critical security studies emerged in
the 1990s as a critique of dominant state-centred security studies and
politics, to question what security is and who it is for. Most authors
writing in this tradition agree that the meaning of security is
constructed. Consequently, critical security studies has engaged with
ideas on the value and ethics of security directly, with two of the most
influential early approaches presenting contrasting views. The
Copenhagen School study security as securitization, viewing security as
negative and usually best avoided14. Meanwhile, the Welsh School define
security as emancipation, emphasising its positive value and
potential15. Alongside this, there have been ongoing debates over the
referent of security, including attempts to attach normatively positive
adjectives to security to overcome the negative aspects, from global
security to human security, which have made important contributions16.
These perspectives have provoked growing debate over the nature, or
value, of security. While it doesn't use the language of the
negative/positive debate, the Welsh School's understanding of security
is closely aligned with the analytic frame, and is therefore discussed
in more detail later. This section now turns to discuss the influence of
the Copenhagen School's securitization theory on the negative/positive
security debate. Many of the contributions in the negative/positive
debate explicitly use securitization as a starting point or even as
shorthand for security. The Copenhagen School argue that issues 'become'
security when a (usually elite) actor constructs them as such through
security speech-acts and this designation is accepted by the relevant
audience, moving the issue from the realm of politics and democracy into
a realm of security where extraordinary emergency measures are
enabled17. Securitization is seen to have 'inevitable negative effects',
including 'the logic of necessity, the narrowing of choice, the
empowerment of a smaller elite'18. The Copenhagen School argue that
security cannot escape its traditional connotations because of how it is
used in the field of practice: in historical terms, it is national
security19. They view the realm of security as opposed to normal
politics and based on these assumptions they argue that in most cases
'security should be seen as a negative, as a failure to deal with issues
as normal politics'20. As a result, they suggest that while
securitization may sometimes be necessary most issues are best dealt
with outside of the security sphere, or 'desecuritized' 21. The limits
of securitization theory have been covered elsewhere so will not be
dealt with indepth here22. Many more recent contributions to the
negative/positive debate draw on securitization theory, but [the debate
suffers from a lack of distinction between 'security' and
'securitization']{.underline}23. Following McDonald, I argue that
[securitization only represents a particular type of security
construction.]{.underline} While arguing that 'the meaning of a concept
lies in its usage and is not something we can define analytically or
philosophically according to what would be "best"'24, Buzan et al.
simultaneously limit the meaning of security to very specific usages by
particular actors. Ciută discusses this in-depth, arguing that the
Copenhagen School's theoretical definition of security takes precedence
over situated security practice, limiting analysis to how security works
when situated actors 'happen to act in theoretically prescribed ways'25.
Consequently, [securitization theory neglects security when it doesn't
fit the framework, such as when it is framed using a different language
of security that does not rely on friend/foe distinctions and
non-democratic procedures.]{.underline} These do not enable emergency
measures and are therefore not cases of securitization. Based on their
definition of security, the Copenhagen School broadly favour
desecuritization. However, [in privileging a particular notion of
'security' that can only be articulated by those in a position of power,
they overlook the ways in which other actors already contest dominant
notions of security and threat, articulating alternative, more positive,
concepts of security]{.underline}26. The Copenhagen School struggle to
see security when it does not follow their rules. Therefore, I suggest
that [securitization theory presents a narrow, particular understanding
of security]{.underline}, rather than the understanding of security.
While [critical approaches to security]{.underline} have been concerned
with both the politics and ethics of security they [have tended to
assume security has a universal logic]{.underline}27. The emerging
debate on the value of security presents a more nuanced perspective,
exploring which characteristics or features make security negative or
positive28. Yet, as noted in the introduction, there are clear
variations between key authors' definitions of 'negative' and 'positive'
security and these differences are not addressed or made explicit. Some
of this confusion is inevitable, reflecting the fact that different
approaches have developed from distinctive literatures, focus on
different dimensions of security and have different normative
commitments. Most obviously some focus on security as a state of being,
while others analyse security as a process or practice: those who focus
on security as a state of being tend to be more optimistic about its
positive potential, while those who study security as a process tend to
point to the problematic features or consequences of existing security
processes29. However, the two are not always easy to separate30, and few
authors who focus on security as a state of being overlook security as a
process. The different uses of these terms matters and needs to be
acknowledged, since it stalls the debate as people talk at cross
purposes. [While recognising that security can be positive or negative,
authors also continue to define what is negative and positive in the
abstract.]{.underline} The debate over the value of security raises
important questions about the kind of politics we desire. [To move
forward we need]{.underline} a common language, or at least [open
recognition when we are talking about different things. We also need to
recognise that what is good usually depends on the context]{.underline}:
this is discussed further in the final section.

#### Security is not inherently good or bad. The Aff can only be evaluated based on its specific advantages and disadvantages

The alternative frame [I propose]{.underline} bridges the analytic and
normative frames but focuses on [analysing how security is used in
different contexts]{.underline} to gain practically useful knowledge60.
I retain the normative use of positive and negative as good and bad
respectively, [to recognise that security can be problematic,
but]{.underline} use the analytic frame to suggest that while we cannot
define what characterises 'good' or 'bad' security in the abstract, [the
'goodness' of different security practices in a context should be
understood on a spectrum.]{.underline} I call this [the pragmatist
frame]{.underline}, since it [draws]{.underline} on the pragmatist
philosophy of Dewey and James to shift [the debate away from developing
objective definitions or criteria for when security is good or bad and
towards seeking practically useful knowledge about the value of
security, which is contingent and context-dependent.]{.underline}
Empirically, this lends itself to practice-centred analysis, and here I
draw on a wider notion of practice following Adler and Pouliot. Lastly,
it brings in contextualism. [Contextualist contributions on the meaning
of security]{.underline} tell us that security means different things in
different contexts, that it [doesn't have an unchanging
'essence']{.underline}61. [The meaning and the practice of security is
contested and produced through 'a process of
negotiation']{.underline}62. I suggest here that [if security is
contingent, it cannot be inherently good or bad.]{.underline} Rather,
[we can only understand the value of security by studying how it works
and what it does in different empirical contexts.]{.underline} Bringing
pragmatist, practice and contextualist literatures together and into
this debate provides an important new lens through which to understand
the value of security. While the space to explore the practical
implications of this is limited here, the final parts of this section
considers how the framework could be used to study the value of security
and tackles some of the limitations and questions it raises. Pragmatism
is a philosophical approach drawing on the work of authors like John
Dewey and William James. It has grown in popularity in IR63 but remains
overlooked in debates over security ethics64. A pragmatic approach does
not aim to uncover or produce an objective 'truth' that is 'out there',
but rather to gain practically useful knowledge65. Dewey and James are
united in emphasising the importance of uncertainty and rejecting
settled 'truths', 'fixed principles, closed systems, and pretended
absolutes and origins'66. They suggest instead that [truth is contingent
on context and experience, and never fixed]{.underline}: thus the
'quest' for truth is never settled. Cochran refers to this as a 'weak
foundationalism' allowing contingent ethical claims67. Following this,
James emphasises a shift away from first principles and categories,
towards last things and consequences -- [an idea or practice is 'good'
if the results are deemed to be good, and only for as long as the
results are deemed to be good]{.underline}68. Ultimately, [good ideas
are ideas which 'are also helpful in life's practical struggles'69 and
the value of a thing depends on what that thing does or leads to in
practical terms]{.underline}: what sensations, habits or actions it will
produce70. This will in turn vary in different cases and at different
times. Dewey also emphasises practice and individual experience as
necessary for ethical enquiry71. [Pragmatism thus suggests that to
understand the value of security, we need to conduct detailed empirical
enquiry to see how different actors use it in different contexts and how
individuals experience it]{.underline}, asking what do different
security practices do? What actions and habits do they produce, and how
do they affect life experiences? While the answers to these questions
remain contingent, a pragmatic contingent ethics allows us to suggest
alternatives while emphasising reflexivity. We can therefore understand
when security is good or bad in a particular situation.
Methodologically, pragmatism emphasises abduction and starting at the
middle level, [instead of starting from abstract theoretical
principles]{.underline} or inferring propositions from facts72. In this
way, [we can analyse when human beings experience security as a
'good']{.underline} (and vice versa). This shifts the discussion away
from the abstract potential of security to be 'good' or 'bad', towards
empirical research analysing what it 'does' in different contexts. The
way in which [pragmatism]{.underline} is used here [lends itself to
practice-centred analysis.]{.underline} Practicecentred approaches study
practices and how they (re)produce particular ideas and realities73.
Here I draw on a wider notion of practice following Adler and Pouliot,
which fits more logically with pragmatism. Thus 'practice' includes
discursive practices as well as ideas, power relations, policies and
physical practices undertaken in the name of security74. Vitally,
practices are distinguished from behaviour or actions because they are
'socially meaningful patterns of action'75. A wider understanding of
practice allows us to study a range of security practices and processes,
including contestation and resistance to hegemonic security practices.
[This means that we can study a range of actors beyond elites, while
recognising the importance of power]{.underline}. Pragmatism is vague on
research methods but practice approaches can provide a clear toolkit for
how to study security in a way that is compatible with a pragmatic
approach76. It also gives us an empirical starting point: security
practices.

#### Critiquing bad forms of securitization requires opening up the concept with new understandings based social good

of Sheffield, "What is the value of security? Contextualizing the
negative/positive debate," *Review of International Studies*,

So where do we look for security?84 I have already suggested security
practices as a starting point. Authors used here focus largely on
discourse, while this paper suggests going beyond that to consider
practices more broadly. Thus, at its most basic, we should start by
looking at actual security practices in a particular context and asking
what they do. I have emphasised the need for detailed empirical enquiry
to see how different actors use security in different contexts and how
individuals experience it, asking what different security practices do,
what actions and habits they produce, and how they affect life
experiences. Situated in-depth case studies lend themselves most
obviously to such analysis of the value of security. They are also more
likely to provide situated and practically useful knowledge. Bubandt's
study of security practices in Indonesia in an excellent example here:
he analyses how state and global security notions/structures are
contested or absorbed at local levels, and how local notions feed back
into both. While the focus in his study is on the meaning of security
the methods could be equally useful for studying its value. An analysis
could study global, state and/or non-state security practices,
considering both more 'high profile' practices with a lot of influence
and marginalised or 'smaller' everyday security practices85. This
necessarily needs to include a consideration of power: where it lies and
how this is reproduced. Thus, [a contextualised and practice-centred
approach to the value of security looks at how different actors
understand and practice security and analyses what these different
understandings and practices of security do.]{.underline} The following
questions may be useful when undertaking such an analysis: • Who are the
key actors? • Who is empowered to practice security and who is not? •
How do different actors represent security? • What practices do they
undertake, what do they do? • What do they emphasise or call for? • What
do they want to protect, how and from what? • What does the practice aim
to do, and what does it do? • What effects do the practices produce? •
What actions and habits do they produce, and how do they affect life
experiences? • Are they helpful in daily struggles (the pragmatist
test)? • Do they protect, enable or constrain referents? • What are the
ethical implications of the practices studied? This is not an exhaustive
list but it does provide a starting point. The answers to these
questions will vary in different contexts. Which actors/practices are
important to study will also depend on the project and case/s studied.
We also need to recognise the interconnectedness of security issues86.
For example, a security practice may be helpful to the daily struggles
of some but produce insecurity for others. Thus, the wider ethical
implications of the practices analysed need to be taken into
consideration. We are also left with the normative problem of which
actors we choose to study: which practices do we study, whose voices do
we listen to, and why? Pragmatism does not give satisfying answers to
questions about power: whose daily struggles should practices be helpful
to, and who gets to decide if the results of a practice are good?
McDonald pursues a normative agenda drawing on emancipation, concerned
with 'locating immanent possibilities for emancipatory change' by
opening space for alternative voices87. While I am sympathetic to this
approach, it is worth remembering that alternative is not necessarily
'better' in ethical terms: consider right-wing groups using security to
advocate for closing EU borders to refugees escaping war, for example.
So who do we listen to and study, and on what basis do we make this
decision? In most cases and contexts studied, there will be a range of
actors practicing and articulating security. Covering a range of actors
will help to capture different ways of practicing security, which will
then allow for more depth when we consider the ethical implications of
these security practices. This doesn't mean all studies have to cover
all actors: a study could focus on a single state, non-state groups, or
one or more international organisation/s: but in each of these there
will likely be some contestation, resistance and disagreement. [By
analysing how security is contested in different spaces, we also
recognise that security is a 'situated interactive
activity']{.underline}88 and needs to be understood, and studied, as
such. To give another example, Bilgic studied security in Tahrir square,
focusing on how protesters experienced and practiced security during one
week. He draws on feminist work to rethink emancipation, emphasizing how
'individuals and social groups' themselves articulate security: 'that
is, their own expressions of how security is understood by them'89. A
similar approach could be used to understand the value of different
security practices in such a case. Looking at gender, resistance and
human security, Hoogensen and Stuvoy suggest that ['the way to
understand and to establish knowledge about security in empirical terms
is to enter people's life-worlds and access local experiences of
in/securities']{.underline} 90. These examples both emphasise smaller
scale security practices and experiences of security, but studies could
equally analyse how different actors within the United Nations practice
security within that institutional setting and the value of such
practices, for example. My own work has looked at how different actors
within the United States and China practice energy security, and the
value or ethical implications of different security practices in this
context91. The introduction to this article noted the importance of
considering the role of the analyst in normative analysis. A pragmatic
focus on practice partly removes this problem, by focusing on detailed
empirical enquiry as opposed to imposing analytical criteria for what
makes particular security practices 'good' or 'bad'. In particular,
focusing on individuals' (or groups) own articulations of security92,
and evaluating these normatively. However, we cannot fully avoid
normative judgement, which is where Ciută's emphasis on normative
awareness and reflexivity is useful. Reflexivity and positionality
requires acknowledging the role of the researcher in the research
process and in interpreting the data93. Security analysts are not
neutral, and will always arrive with preconceived ideas and opinions
about the concept and value of security. This only makes openness about
normative commitments more important so these can be recognised and
interrogated. The role of the security analyst is always political: the
key is 'to be aware of \[and explicit about\] the political significance
of analysis'94. The normative commitments of the analyst will also
likely vary between cases studied in contextual security analysis. For
example, in my analyses of energy security practices I emphasise the
connections between human well-being and environmental security, for the
simple reason that without environmentally sustainable energy security
practices in the longer term there will be no individual experiences, no
human well-being to consider, no daily struggles to be helpful to, as
the planetary ecosystems on which human survival depend will collapse.
What is 'good' therefore depends on the context and what different
security practices do in that context, as well as the analyst. This is
why we need to be clear and open about normative commitments.
Recognising the subjective and context-dependent nature of the value of
security will in turn fuel and forward the debate instead of getting
gridlocked in debates over the impossibility of an objectively defined
'good'. However, a pragmatist frame also recognises the need to keep
these categories open. So how do we determine what is and isn't
security, and thus which practices to study? The focus here is on
analysing how security is used and using this to further understanding
of the value of security. Thus the focus is on studying existing
security practices, and what they 'do' in different empirical contexts
-- taking a broad interpretation of 'practice'. Here I mean specifically
practices undertaken in the name of security 95 . This doesn\'t mean
security couldn't be something else, or that there aren't further things
that could or should be secured (which currently are not), but the focus
here is on how different existing practices of 'security' in empirical
contexts can help us understand the value of security. Here, I argue in
favour of pluralism and diversity: [rather than narrowing down what we
mean by 'security' to very specific uses or particular (elite) actors,
looking at a more diverse range of actors and a more diverse range of
meanings of security (beyond survival), serves to illustrate that the
value of security depends on the context. Security studies needs to open
up for the possibility that 'security' can mean very different
things]{.underline}, and that in these cases it is characterised by very
different processes and outcomes. Similarly, it is important to view the
value of security in non-binary terms. [Security is contested:
consequently, to understand security it is necessary to study the full
range of]{.underline} security constructions -- from more problematic
and undesirable security practices, to limited practices which secure us
from threat, to more [emancipatory practices, by a wide range of actors
and in a range of empirical contexts, to really interrogate the value of
security.]{.underline} In a sense this means accepting the range
existing definitions and approaches to the value of security and
studying how they work in practice. The value of security matters: both
because [problematic security practices can do a lot of harm
and]{.underline} [because 'good' or 'positive' security practices can
help us advance towards the kind of world that we want.]{.underline}
However, the current debate over the value of security causes confusion.
This paper has clarified the debate by separating out two different
'frames' used by key authors. The analytic frame draws on
positive/negative liberty and peace, and thus defines negative security
as the absence of threat, and positive security as added enabling
possibilities beyond survival: here positive and negative security work
together. The normative frame uses value judgements and deploys the
terms positive and negative in a normative sense, often drawing on
securitization theory. Consequently, this frame suggests that negative
security is bad and to be avoided, while positive security is desirable.
These frames have their roots in different literatures and although both
theorise the value of security they look at different aspects, leading
to somewhat different research agendas. This causes confusion and has
stalled the debate. This paper has argued that the value of security
depends on how it is used in different empirical contexts, developing a
pragmatic framework for understanding the value of security in context.
This approach allows us to recognise that [security can be bad, but that
it can also be something worth striving for]{.underline}, while avoiding
imposing abstract theoretical definitions of 'good' and 'bad'. Bourne
and Bulley suggest abandoning attempts to establish secure ethics,
arguing that we should instead be 'treating moral choice as explicitly
unsure, uncertain and insecure' 96. Accepting this, a pragmatist frame
helps us move forward with a practical research agenda that avoids
defining the 'good' in theoretical terms while allowing us to evaluate
the normative implications of different existing security practices in a
particular context. Thus the paper opens space for empirically grounded
research on the value of security. The paper focuses on clarifying the
existing debate and suggesting an alternative, so it presents a
conceptual analysis rather than an empirical application. There is
therefore much potential for future research on the value of security in
different contexts. Beyond this, two problems caused by this framework
that require further research come to mind. Firstly, what about cases
where some experience security as a good, but others do not? The ongoing
debate over the surveillance society provides an excellent example: some
experience surveillance as reassuring, while others find it an
imposition on their freedom to go about their daily lives unwatched. In
such cases the role of the analyst becomes much more complicated and
needs to be considered in more depth. Secondly, what about those who
cannot practice security? This framework is merely intended to
understand the value of different existing security practices. More
research is needed into the silences and gaps this creates, as it
overlooks those who cannot speak or practice security but may be deeply
affected by insecurity, whether this be silenced or marginalised groups
or non-human elements in need of protection, such as local or global
ecosystems. This paper has clarified the debate over the value of
security and suggested a new framework for analysing it in context, but
while it pushes the debate forward it also raises new questions.
[Security is powerful and contains potential for harm as well as ethical
progress. Understanding the value of security is crucial in order to
move towards the kind of world that we want.]{.underline}

### 2AC Pragmatism Turn

#### Epistemology critique must move beyond rejection and prescribe pragmatic policy decisions

[For the interpretatively oriented scholars the ideal of cumulative
knowledge]{.underline}, which Keohane outlines [in terms of scientific
inference, obviously speaks for its own limitations]{.underline} (cf.
also King et al., 1994). **[But avoiding this]{.underline}** Scylla
**[need not mean]{.underline}** the Charybdis where **[critical IR lives
on the 'border lines']{.underline}** (Ashley, 1989) **[or chooses to
remain at the critical edges of the alleged mainstream]{.underline}**
and, in effect, in this way leaves the authority of respectable research
(variously claimed by notions such as solid, systematic, empirically
based, etc.) to the mainstream that is the target of its criticism.
Although I applaud the movement that takes distance from the founding
fathers of the discipline by looking for alternative insight in
something like la Boótie (Bleiker, 2000) or versions of Buddhism (Chan,
2000), I also miss the epistemic reflections that, on this basis, can
put critical IR better on par with the conventional mainstream. Since
the post-behaviouralist phase of the discipline (Alker and Biersteker,
1984; Banks, 1985; Holsti, 1985), the movement towards a more global IR
has meant acknowledgement and encouragement of the situation of
incommensurable 'paradigms' or contrasted images. Although fruitful in
the emancipatory sense, this logic is now also conducive to what many
argue is already the state of IR: dispersion of the discipline into an
increasingly scattered field of International Studies. **[The
'post'-culture that has dominated critical IR during the past decade or
two has already performed its task. It is time to move beyond the
concept that, in its disbelief in (an often caricaturist notion of)
'science' and critique of extreme forms of rationality, has produced a
bifurcated and]{.underline}** (as I will argue in greater detail below)
**[not altogether adequate account of the historical
discipline.]{.underline}** The stagnant condition of our disciplinary
debates has been described by for example Patomäki and Wight (2000). In
addition, Neufeld, whose work I will touch upon in the following,
outlines the dualistic condition of the field as a point of departure
for his reflections (1995: 46--69). Like these writers, I, too,seek to
reconstruct and on this basis open up new avenues for IR theory. I share
Patomäki and Wight's notion that '[post-positivism' has left us with an
ontological void]{.underline}, but unlike the Critical Realism proposed
by these authors [my suggestion for new directions is not a conception
of ontological realism and the epistemological and methodological
pluralism that logically relates to such critical scientific
enterprise]{.underline}.1 In relation to Neufeld, my conclusions on IR
theory are similar, but the argument itself is very different. While
Neufeld reconstructs IR theory in the perspective of the emancipatory
ideas of classical critical theory (the Frankfurt School and Habermas),
my argument deals with the promise of pragmatism. Unlike Neufeld's
argument, in the epistemic sense it is not limited to a critical reading
in a theoretical perspective (i.e. a relation between the words in the
text and the reader; on this reading strategy see, e.g. Skinner, 1988).
Moreover, what I have to say has been motivated not only by the IR
writers mentioned above but also by some recent introductions of
pragmatism (Millennium 31: 3, issued in January 2002, article references
below). By presenting pragmatism as a new alley of inquiry which
continues from (and hence takes for granted) the situation of
disciplinary debates described as an opposition between positivists and
post-positivists, these recent contributions fail to appreciate how
pragmatism grows from and ties into the web of previous discourse. Hence
a key point in pragmatism itself, the question of how knowledge emerges
on the grounds of previous knowledge and experience, is not fully
realized. Richard J. Bernstein (1983) has emphasized (and a number of
other authors have reiterated the point) that the incommensurability ---
of forms of life, traditions, epistemologies --- which Rorty speaks for
(and here follows other philosophers of uncertainty and critics of
analytic philosophy) need not, and should not, be taken to suggest total
exclusivity of concepts and frameworks (cf. also Kuhn, 1970). Rather,
the hermeneutical moment speaks for the openness of experience,
understanding and language, and proposes that we look for some points of
possible agreement and disagreement. For Bernstein, [this means a
possibility to contribute to the movement beyond
objectivism-and-relativism, two sides of the same coin]{.underline} that
he calls the Cartesian Anxiety. In the same way, [I take the
hermeneutical moment as a possibility to approach our field of study,
IR, as a potentially global field which, in principle, possesses a
domain of total knowledge, although **this does not mean a logic of
hegemony operating with some generic concept(s).**]{.underline} Inspired
by Umberto Eco's notion of knowledge as an encyclopaedic network, [I
like to think of IR as a discursive web that, in the potentiality of its
connections, is global, although any actual piece of knowledge or point
of view is always only loca]{.underline}l (Eco, 1984: 68--86).2 In the
broadly pragmatist sense, we can speak of IR as a web of justified
beliefs (conventional and with a habitual ground) which, in a variety of
ways, seeks to make sense of the world and to solve the intellectual
irritation (C. S. Peirce) and the moral dissatisfaction (John Dewey)
that belong to human openness and an inquiring attitude towards
reality.**[This approach calls for an understanding of epistemology that
reaches beyond the postmodernists' rejection of the 'iron cage of
reason']{.underline}**. We can begin with the notion that
[epistemological issues basically deal with the grounds we have for
accepting and rejecting beliefs. Reason is only one possibility among
human faculties]{.underline} and, beyond being postulated, can also open
up as existential (the quest for certainty arises from the fundamental
experience of uncertainty). It can also take the conventionalist form of
agreed practice, such as rules and procedures of inference.

#### Pragmatism creates better epistemology and is able to actualize analysis of lived experiences

**Rytövuori-Apunen 05** (Helena, University of Tampere adjunct professor
of IR focusing on qualitative research in International Relations and
Peace and Conflict Research, "Forget 'Post-Positivist' IR!: The Legacy
of IR Theory as the Locus for a Pragmatist Turn," Cooperation and

The task of this paper is to [seek the locus in quo pragmatist
approaches can emerge in IR's field of knowledge and through articulated
disagreement with previous discourse contribute to an increasingly
global discipline beyond the logic of
universalism/dispersion]{.underline}. I argue that [seeing the locus for
pragmatism, i.e. seeing more to it than another approach and a 'new
alley of inquiry', requires rectifying the distortions created by the
postpositivist self-comprehension]{.underline}. An alternative
explanation to what Frost calls the 'positivist bias' can be sought by
examining the specific theorycentred orientation in IR and also the
discursive mechanisms and the social processes by which this relation to
the world becomes the privileged knowledge that is 'orthodoxy'.
'**[Orthodoxy' appears when the theory-centred attitude to knowing,
which emphasizes theoretical perspective and conceptual logic, loses its
footprints in its colloquial interpretations and presents reality 'as it
is' (naturalized ontology).]{.underline}** I will now discuss what the
disagreement, the articulation of which I argue is required for
maintenance of the idea of the corpus of knowledge as a web of
discourse, can mean as a research orientation. I point to a way of
inquiry which starts with Dewey, but in the epistemic sense draws from
C. S. Peirce's conception of 'reality' as pragma and the pragmaticist
logic of inquiry. I propose that a focus in the current introductions of
pragmatism on the Deweyan inheritance of classical pragmatism
(Millennium 31: 3) does not help us to solve the epistemological issues
pertinent in the situation which already builds on and looks beyond the
'linguistic turn' and calls for methodical solutions that fit together
with these more recent tendencies. The Missing Piece: The Interpretative
Aspect of 'Discourse' and 'Culture' The identification of what I suggest
is a paradigmatic feature of the disciplinary mainstream and the legacy
of IR Theory (capital letter to mark out this legacy) makes it possible,
through ontological criticism, to point out two opposed epistemic paths,
one based on the primacy of theory, the other proceeding from the
primacy of practice. Opposed to the approach that models the world
(produces a 'world picture', as Martin Heidegger says)22 is the
orientation that proceeds from and seeks to refine what already, in some
way, is present in our experience. Above, I have criticized the tendency
to read disciplinary tradition in a way which, rather than focusing on
analytical difference, subsumes instances of previous theory under a
shared characterization and thereby suppresses the potentiality that as
possibility of interpretation exists in the historical body of
knowledge. In the same vein of argument, it is important to note that
the [opposition of epistemic positions is not only inter- but also
intra-textual]{.underline}. For example Organski's ambition to 'organize
the mass of \[\...\] information to which we are all exposed' arises
from the experience that the international distribution of power is
constantly shifting and that this moment, along with the importance of
internal determinants of power, has been neglected by the balance of
power theory (Organski, 1958: vii; 1961: 373--5). [Analysing how
concepts relate to historical experience and the dissatisfaction felt
about previous approaches provides a point of departure]{.underline} for
a reconstruction of theory [that]{.underline}, from within the theory,
[opens up possibilities]{.underline} of interpretation
[that]{.underline} also [challenge the theory-centred
ambition]{.underline} (on the parallel to Descartes, see Toulmin, 1990:
56--137). Recontextualization offers a way to redress the biases of
decontextualized theory, and this does not mean a Romanticist emphasis
on 'intrinsic meaning' and the unique in experience (cf. Ashley, 1989:
278). The nexus of theory and practice, which is there in the text but
which, beyond the text, deals with a historically situated moral agency,
offers a point of departure for an epistemic turn that transcends the
bifurcation of empiricist and rationalist epistemology. **[The question
I have in mind is about the 'how' rather than the 'what' of specific
experience]{.underline}**. [It is about the modes of encountering and
making sense of the world, modes that through their habitual and
institutional mechanisms can also become modalities of professional
activity]{.underline}, such as the theory-centred episteme discussed
above. [A pragmatist re-interpretation of the texts of the early
realists, for example, can elucidate how the ideals and guidelines for
statesmanship and diplomacy arise from a world-experience that is
different from but also partly similar or isomorphic to
ours]{.underline}, and what commensurability there is, on this basis, in
the logics of practice which in the different historical contexts
generate policies in order to control perceived threats. **[Such inquiry
and assessment of the legacy of IR theory seeks to sustain a living
discourse diachronically through time without turning into a study of
past historical praxis]{.underline}**.23 Without bypassing the 'weight
of the discourse' (Foucault),24 [it starts out with situated moral
agency and collective human intentionality and, on this basis,
recognizes the inseparability of lived experience and the structures of
experience that organize instances of experience]{.underline}. In the
ontological sense, pragma means that whatever 'is' for a human
interpretant exists not by a substance but by the regularities that
endow it with its being. In the pragmatist research orientation,
[pragma]{.underline} (from the Greek word 'business', originally 'a
thing done')25 means more than a way of carrying out the 'business' of
research. It [involves a critical assessment of the body of previous
knowledge and requires that a new practice brings some advancement in
relation to it]{.underline}. Like William James, John Dewey -- the most
influential pragmatist figure in social science and an author to whom
the present-day discussion in IR in most cases makes reference -- was
interested in the question of how the powers of habit that maintain life
serve to channel all thought, including the original of creative
invention, and how the disposition of habitual responses evolves in the
encounter of new types of problems. Dewey's pragmatist ethics sought to
cure the social and individual alienation that in his argument
originates from the legacy of Western thought in ontological formalism,
i.e. a dogmatic application of Plato's idealism. Dewey emphasized that
the 'physician is lost who would guide his activities of healing by
building up a picture of perfect health'; instead, the physician needs
to employ 'what he has discovered about actual cases of good health and
ill health and their causes to investigate the present ailing individual
so as to further his recovering; recovering, an intrinsic and living
process \...' (Owen, 2002: 670). Void of the inside knowledge, which
involves a reflective relationship to previous practice, praxis (an
established or customary practice) is like touching without realizing
how by the same act one is being touched, i.e. the static position and
alienation which Dewey argued were at the root of social problems
(Dewey, 1981: 620--43).

### 2AC AT Forever War

#### Conflicts have discernable causes and resolutions\-\--specific proposals are key\-\--removing intervention as a tool is worse

**Singh 19** \[Michael, M.B.A., Harvard University (Baker Scholar);
B.A., Princeton University, Lane-Swig Senior Fellow and managing
director at The Washington Institute and a former senior director for
Middle East affairs at the National Security Council, 11/6/19, "Why the
talk of 'endless wars' misses the mark",
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/06/why-talk-endless-wars-misses-mark/\]

It's a notion that is difficult to resist --- who exactly is for
"endless war," after all? --- and rooted in deep public frustration with
the costly but seemingly fruitless interventions of the post-9/11 era.
But **[[as a guide]{.mark} to]{.underline}** [policymaking]{.underline},
[**[opposition to]{.underline}** ["forever wars"]{.underline} **[is not
useful]{.underline}**. **[Such terms conflate]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[three [separate concerns, each of which demands separate
consideration.]{.mark}]{.underline}** First and most fundamentally,
**[opposition to "endless wars" reflects skepticism regarding the
deployment of U.S. military forces overseas, and of intervention as a
policy tool.]{.underline}** According to the Defense Department, there
are about 200,000 U.S. service members deployed overseas in nearly 170
different countries or territories --- a remarkable number given that
there are just 195 countries in the world. **[Yet the [differences
among]{.mark} the]{.underline}** **[United States']{.underline}**
**[[various military missions are stark]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [**and
[each deserves ]{.mark}**[independent scrutiny rather than blanket
opposition]{.mark}]{.underline} or, for that matter, knee-jerk support.
**[It should be obvious that [the 55,000 U.S. troops in Japan are
engaged in different work than]{.mark} our [5,200]{.mark} or so service
members [in Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Less well-recognized,
however, is how much **[even one combat mission in the Middle East
differs from another. At its height, the Iraq War
involved]{.underline}** almost **[160,000 U.S. soldiers.]{.underline}**
**[The]{.underline}** U.S. military **[mission in Syria]{.underline}**,
on the other hand, has **[involved]{.underline}** roughly **[2,000
soldiers]{.underline}** who have rallied a local partner force
70,000-strong, enabled a coalition air campaign, and provided a platform
for civilian stabilization activities. It was an altogether more
economical deployment, and perhaps even a model for future
interventions. Yet both President Trump and his critics have lumped
Syria in with Iraq and Afghanistan as another example of "endless war."
The second concern covered by the term "endless war" is the seeming
overemphasis on the broader Middle East in U.S. foreign policy in recent
decades; critics use the term to inveigh against involvement in Syria or
Afghanistan far more often, than say, Somalia. As we engage in what
seems an inevitable shift away from the Middle East, however, we will
find that the real problem is less the prioritization of the Middle East
than the heavily military focus of U.S. policy there. External
intervention in the region clearly hasn't always promoted stability ---
just see post-2003 Iraq. And major wars aren't the only problem. The
United States also sends the lion's share of our global security
assistance --- training and equipment --- to the Middle East. Yet as
events of the past several years attest, these programs have an
underwhelming record of delivering security. On their own, military
intervention and security assistance can't solve the deeper problems
that drive conflict, such as stagnant economies or repressive political
systems. Nor have they stemmed the growth of violent extremism, which
has seen a manifold increase since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11,
2001. Yet, ironically, even as we have grown weary of intervening, we
have also decreased our commitment to promoting economic reform and
political liberalization, or to the diplomatic leadership required to
prevent conflicts or resolve them short of war. Finally, worries about
"endless war" often stem from a mismatch between stated U.S. objectives
and the means we are willing to use to achieve them. This has been a
bipartisan malady, and the causes are complex. Our immense military and
economic advantages lead us to set unrealistic goals, and the impatience
of our politics sometimes leads us to withdraw support even from
achievable missions Syria provides examples of both fallacies. One can
fault President Barack Obama, who insisted that "Assad must go" but
failed to devise a strategy that could come close to delivering such an
outcome. But one can also fault Trump, who refused to spend even the
funds that Congress appropriated for stabilization in northeastern Syria
and who has reduced a successful 2,000-troop mission to one consisting
of several hundred --- apparently without scaling back its objectives.

to]{.mark} America's]{.underline} **[[endless
wars]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only one problem: **[[We're not fighting
any]{.underline}]{.mark}** [endless wars.]{.underline} No matter. The
endless-war warriors want us to do less on the world stage. [Even in
this age of great power **competition**]{.underline}, [these "new"
**[isolationists]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[would prefer America]{.mark}
step off the playing field and [wave from the
**sidelines**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [It's a strategy that would
work well for **Beijing**]{.underline}, **[Tehran]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Moscow]{.underline}** -- but not for the U.S. No
one is denying we've seen plenty of wars -- and long ones at that. The
U.S. has fought more than it ever wanted, including the global war on
terrorism and related conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. [But America's
**endless war days** have **ended**]{.underline} -- [at least for
now]{.underline}. That's not to say we don't have troops in combat zones
around the world. But, by any reasonable definition, [America just isn't
at war]{.underline}. [We are, for sure, dealing with the
**aftermath**]{.underline} [of conflicts in Iraq and
Afghanistan]{.underline}. But President [Obama's withdrawal of U.S.
forces from Iraq marked the end of that **war**]{.underline}, [and he
transitioned the effort in Afghanistan all-out fighting to an
**advice-and-assist**]{.underline} mission. [Today, what America does
around the world is pretty much what it has been doing
since]{.underline} **[1945]{.underline}** -- providing **[forward

**[counterterrorism]{.underline}**, **[training]{.underline}**,
**[assistance]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[freedom of

lift,]{.underline} [but]{.underline} **[it ain't war]{.underline}**. So
[[what the carpers are really complaining about is not "**endless
wars**]{.underline}"]{.mark} ([an admittedly **powerful** albeit
**dishonest**]{.underline} [catch-phrase), but U.S. foreign policy in
general. So the question is: [**what foreign policy do they want
instead?** The U.S. is a global power]{.mark} with global **interests**
and **responsibilities**]{.underline}. [[That's **not a
choice**]{.underline}]{.mark}; it's just who we are. [No one today is
arguing that the U.S. can **child-proof the world**]{.underline} [to

George W. [Bush]{.underline} era [clearly created as many problems as
they solved.]{.underline} But, **[[walking away]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[from problems [doesn't work]{.mark} well **either**]{.underline} -- [as
the [Obama]{.mark} team more than amply demonstrated. They
[ended]{.mark} the war in **[Iraq]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And, [for
that, [we got a war with the **caliphate**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [They
ended the war in Afghanistan]{.underline}. For that, [we got the
resurgence of the **Taliban**]{.underline}. [[The reset with Russia
produced]{.mark} a war in]{.underline}
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Tried to buy Iran off, and that
**didn't work**]{.underline}. And [they stood by as **China** moved to

**[Korea's]{.underline}** [[Kim built]{.mark} out [his **nuclear

ground. He isn't interested in being the world's babysitter, but he is
willing to stand up and demonstrate sufficient resolve to protect
America's interest. He has managed to do that -- and finish off the
Caliphate -- without starting any new wars. So where are the endless
wars? Or, more to the point, what's so bad about this administration's
foreign policy? Look around, and you'll see Russia stonewalled in
Crimea. Iran just failed to close the Straits of Hormuz. The DPRK is
negotiating. The Stars and Stripes proudly sail the South China Seas,
and there is nothing Beijing can do about. Apparently, that's not good
enough for [the end [the **endless-war warriors**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Fear of death is critical to prevent violence and make life meaningful -- discussion is key -- our framing is productive 

**Williams 11** (Michael, International Affairs Prof @ University of
Ottawa, "Securitization Theory: How Security Problems Emerge and
Dissolve," pg. 219-220) \*\*\*edited for ableist language

[Fear]{.underline} [has]{.underline} generally [had a bad name in
modernity]{.underline}. It has been seen as something to be banished
-freedom from it was the target of one ofFranklin Roosevelt\'s \'four
freedoms\', and it is today one of the unifying elements of the Human
Security agenda and, in certain forms at least, of Critical Security
Studies. From a different but equally hostile perspective, some
philosophic accounts see modernity as based in fear, and its (generally
destructive) preoccupation with security as a consequence of this more
basic foundation. To still others, [fear is an
**instrument**]{.underline} [which]{.underline}, [far from being part of
the **existential condition of modernity**]{.underline}, [has been made
more powerful and effective by the structures of modem
politics]{.underline}. 5 Each of these three [views]{.underline},
despite their apparent (and by no means insubstantial) differences, [are
united in their basic vision off fear **as negative**]{.underline}. And
there is no doubt that their assault on the politics of fear and its
negative effects is an indispensable element of any serious analysis of
security. Yet it is also the case that **[[to reject fear]{.mark}
completely,]{.underline}** or to see it as wholly antithetical to
security [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} both **[[analytically]{.mark} and
politically]{.underline}**
blinding**[\[[ineffective\]]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In contrast to these
modem views of fear, many older traditions of thought exhibit a rather
different sensibility, and provided a more nuanced and potentially more
productive view of the politics offear. To take one example, in the eyes
of perhaps the greatest political philosopher of fear, Thomas Hobbes,
[the human condition was dominated by]{.underline}
[multiple]{.underline} [and]{.underline} often [contradictory and
competing forms of fear]{.underline}: [the fear of
**death**]{.underline} itself; the fear of violent death [at the hands
of others]{.underline}, [which marked a fear of dishonor]{.underline} (
of Pride and the sense of self) [more than it did of **mere
mortality**]{.underline};[6 fear of the **unknown**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[unknowable future]{.underline}** [and
its]{.underline} potential [hazards]{.underline} (Blits 1989).7
[Fear]{.underline}, in short, [was everywhere]{.underline}, and while
Hobbes freely admitted that he might have felt its effects more acutely
than many people, he was convinced nonetheless that it dominated the
human condition, and that **[[a complete escape]{.mark} from fear was
[possible only temporarily in sleep,]{.mark} and ultimately, in death.
Yet]{.underline}** Hobbes did not view fear wholly negatively. Indeed,
he believed that [the **[absence]{.mark}** of fear]{.underline}
**[[could be as dangerous as]{.mark} its
[over-abundance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Disregard of the fear of
death]{.underline}]{.mark} as a result of vanity and the search for
glory or honour, he believed, [[could lead to **the worst forms of
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [misplaced certainly]{.underline}
(belief in the security of knowledge) [could result in
**[dogmatism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[intolerance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[violence]{.underline}** **[in the name of universal
truths]{.underline}**. [Recognizing]{.underline}]{.mark} [these
[dangerous beliefs and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[fearing]{.mark} their
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, [[could act as a
**positive constraint** on **human excesses**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} **[foster peace]{.underline}**.
[Fear]{.underline}]{.mark} [arising from the absence of specific forms
of fear]{.underline} (of, for instance, conflicts arising from
Vain-glory or religious zealotry that overwhelmed the fear of death, or
that arose from a failure to acknowledge the limits human knowledge and
an unwillingness to live with the fear presented by the inability to
control an essentially uncertain future) **[[could lead to a politics
that restrained these beliefs and behaviours]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
other words, the fear off fear (and of the practices likely to lead to
extreme fear) could act as a check upon the politics of fear. However
difficult it might be to achieve, **[[fear was in principle capable of
supporting forms of positive, pacific action.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### 2AC Consequentialism Good

#### Failing to prevent a horrible outcome is just as bad as causing it -- don't side with moral evasion 

**Nielsen 93** \[Kai Nielsen, Professor of Philosophy, University of
Calgary, Absolutism and Its Consequentialist Critics, ed. Joram Graf
Haber, 1993, p. 170-2\] we do not endorse gendered language

Forget the levity of the example and consider the case of the innocent
fat man. If there really is no other way of unsticking our fat man and
if plainly, without blasting him out, everyone in the cave will drown,
then, innocent or not, he should be blasted out. This indeed overrides
the principle that the innocent should never be deliberately killed, but
it does not reveal a callousness toward life, for the people involved
are caught in a desperate situation in which, if such extreme action is
not taken, many lives will be lost and far greater misery will obtain.
Moreover, the people who do such a horrible thing or acquiesce in the
doing of it are not likely to be rendered more callous about human life
and human suffering as a result. Its occurrence will haunt them for the
rest of their lives and is as likely as not to make them more rather
than less morally sensitive. It is not even correct to say that such a
desperate act shows a lack of respect for persons. We are not treating
the fat man merely as a means. The fat man\'s person‑his interests and
rights are not ignored. Killing him is something which is undertaken
with the greatest reluctance. It is only when it is quite certain that
there is no other way to save the lives of the others that such a
violent course of action is justifiably undertaken. Alan Donagan,
arguing rather as Anscombe argues, maintains that \"to use any innocent
man ill for the sake of some public good is directly to degrade him to
being a mere means\" and to do this is of course to violate a principle
essential to morality, that is, that human beings should never merely be
treated as means but should be treated as ends in themselves (as persons
worthy of respect).\" But, as my above remarks show, it need not be the
case, and in the above situation it is not the case, that in killing
such an innocent man we are treating him merely as a means. The action
is universalizable, all alternative actions which would save his life
are duly considered, the blasting out is done only as a last and
desperate resort with the minimum of harshness and indifference to his
suffering and the like. It indeed sounds ironical to talk this way,
given what is done to him. But if such a terrible situation were to
arise, there would always be more or less humane ways of going about
one\'s grim task. And in acting in the more humane ways toward the fat
man, as we do what we must do and would have done to ourselves were the
roles reversed, we show a respect for his person. In so treating the fat
man‑not just to further the public good but to prevent the certain death
of a whole group of people (that is to prevent an even greater evil than
his being killed in this way)‑the claims of justice are not overriden
either, for each individual involved, if he is reasonably correct,
should realize that if he were so stuck rather than the fat man, he
should in such situations be blasted out. Thus, there is no question of
being unfair. Surely we must choose between evils here, but is there
anything more reasonable, more morally appropriate, than choosing the
lesser evil when doing or allowing some evil cannot be avoided? That is,
where there is no avoiding both and where our actions can determine
whether a greater or lesser evil obtains, should we not plainly always
opt for the lesser evil? And is it not obviously a greater evil that all
those other innocent people should suffer and die than that the fat man
should suffer and die? Blowing up the fat man is indeed monstrous. But
letting him remain stuck while the whole group drowns is still more
monstrous. The consequentialist is on strong moral ground here, and, if
his reflective moral convictions do not square either with certain
unrehearsed or with certain reflective particular moral convictions of
human beings, so much the worse for such commonsense moral convictions.
One could even usefully and relevantly adapt herethough for a quite
different purpose‑an argument of Donagan\'s.
**[[Consequentialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the kind I have been
arguing for **[[provides]{.mark} so persuasive \"[a]{.mark} theoretical
[basis for]{.mark} common [morality]{.mark} that when it contradicts
some moral intuition, it is natural to suspect that intuition, not
theory, is corrupt]{.underline}**.\"\" **[[Given the
comprehensiveness]{.mark}, plausibility, and overall rationality of
consequentialism, [it is not unreasonable to override]{.mark} even a
deeply felt [moral conviction]{.mark} if it does not square with such a
theory]{.underline}**, though, if it made no sense or overrode the bulk
of or even a great many of our considered moral convictions, that would
be another matter indeed.
**[[Anticonsequentialists]{.underline}]{.mark}** often **[[point to the
inhumanity of people who will sanction]{.underline}]{.mark}** such
**[[killing]{.mark} of the innocent, [but cannot the compliment be
returned by speaking of the even greater inhumanity]{.mark}, conjoined
with evasiveness, [of those who will allow even more death]{.mark} and
far greater misery [and then excuse themselves on the ground that they
did not intend the death]{.mark}]{.underline}** and misery **[but merely
forbore to prevent it?]{.underline}** In such a context, such reasoning
and such **[[forbearing to prevent seems to]{.mark} me [to constitute a
moral evasion]{.mark}]{.underline}**. I say it is evasive because
**[rather than steeling himself to do what in normal circumstances would
be a horrible and vile act but in this circumstance is a harsh moral
necessity]{.underline}**, **[he allows, when he has the power to prevent
it, a situation which is still many times worse. [They\* tries to keep
their\* \`moral purity\']{.mark} and avoid \`dirty hands\' [at the price
of utter moral failure]{.mark} and what Kierkegaard called
\`double‑mindedness.\' It is understandable that people should act in

## Realism Good

### 2AC Realism Good

#### Even if realism's [foundations]{.underline} are problematic, it's [theoretically useful]{.underline} for understanding IR -- rejecting it [outright]{.underline} is ahistorical and causes [worse violence]{.underline} by greenlighting [ethically untenable]{.underline} positions like the alt 

**Abraham 17** \[Kavi Joseph, Johns Hopkins University. "Making
Machines: Unlikely Resonances between Realist and Postcolonial Thought,"
https://academic.oup.com/ips/article-abstract/11/3/221/3798787\]

This passage marks out one of the biggest obstacles to connecting
realist and postcolonial thought: race. One would be hard pressed to
find in realist theorizations anything resembling a supple understanding
of race and racism (Vitalis 2015)--- though Carr (2001b, 107)
demonstrates a comparatively great deal of reflexivity on postcolonial
liberation (see fn. 2 above). Even in Williams's (2005) "wilful" realist
tradition, there is scant discussion of how an embedded ethic of
critical self-limitation fared in the context of racial or other forms
of radical difference. Absent an engagement with the analytics of
postcolonial thinking, or the diverse ways in which white supremacy,
patriarchy, and heteronormativity inflect past and present liberal
imperial formations, willful realism does not address the categories
that threaten to push prudential skeptics toward violent responses, that
pose limitations to an ethos of limits. As evidenced in Morgenthau,
failure to think critically about race opens up the way for Morgenthau's
theoretical practice to be driven toward resentful rather than careful
ends. It is at this juncture that [those concerned with contemporary
imperial formations are confronted with a number of possible
[responses]{.mark}: one is to [**deem realism**, in all its
**complex**]{.mark} and **contradictory [manifestations]{.mark}**[, as a
**failed**, **unethical**,]{.mark} and **fundamentally [racist/imperial
project]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A second response is to
politically align against liberalism, while holding this partnership at
arm's length. [A third response]{.underline}, derived from Ayoob's
(2002) subaltern realism, [is to work on an **epistemic register**,
**selectively taking insights** from realist traditions that help better
explain the neocolonial world]{.underline}. Morgenthau's racist
interjections should be critiqued and confronted---perhaps by outlining
the innumerable non-Western contributions to the making of so-called
Western modernity (Hobson 2004)---but this [[failing **does not
delegitimize**]{.mark} **other [realist insights]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
What is important for Ayoob's (2002) accommodationist stance is to
combine plausible realist insights with other categories that can grasp
the extent of global politics, including the dynamics of the
postcolonial experience, better. The final response is the one I
advance. To adopt a mode of argumentation concerned with building a
counter-imperial machine is to neither dismiss constituencies that
become caught up in imperial formations, nor merely to tactically align
with them; rather, establishing resonant connections among postcolonial
and realist lines of thought, highlighting shared dispositions to
difference, is to push the latter toward repositioning itself on new
ethical lines that limit contemporary forms of violence. To recover a
minor position in realism is not to accept all realist positions, nor is
it to synthesize or convert any theoretical line into a coherent
framework. It is, however, to amplify the shared spirituality that
informs both realist and postcolonial thinking, drawing constituencies
toward prudential rather than imperial defenses of difference. It is to
furnish current research agendas with an anti-imperial focus, to seek
the creative possibilities that may arise when divergent constituencies
meet, interfuse, and shift. Thus, our response to Morgenthau, as to
other realists, is to cultivate the connections that do exist, not for
epistemic reasons but for a political project that strengthens
counter-imperial movements. Thinking from the Present By way of
conclusion, it is important to reiterate the politics that motivates a
theoretical project of linking realist and postcolonial thinking. If the
ends of this project were to simply gather critiques of liberalism and
its relationship to imperial practices, then certainly a return to
classical realist thought adds little epistemic value over and above
postcolonial approaches. However, the ends of this argument are to
outline and energize a counter-imperial machine, to cultivate a shared
spirituality that can gather diverse and divergent constituencies to
confront dangerous practices. In my estimation, countering an imperial
machine that operates in complex ways and at complex sites requires a
political strategy as unwieldy and diffuse, linking constituencies that
we may otherwise dismiss. [[That a tradition of realism]{.mark}
**regularly [circulates through halls of power]{.mark}** across the
globe **[should be reason not to reject]{.mark} righteously**
[but]{.mark} rather [to **leverage its authorized status**. We can talk
about **imperialism**]{.mark}, **knowledge production**, and **race**
here, [while they can talk about **anarchy**]{.mark}, **power**, [and
**self-interest**]{.mark} there---[or we can theoretically work on the
lines of thought that **reverberate among us**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
reiterate, building a countermachine is not driven to "pragmatic"
reconciliation or consensus and, thus, remains distinct from the
"eclecticism" of other plural approaches popular in IR today. While the
combinatory logic of paradigmatic synthesis has its place, the
connections between realist and postcolonial thought articulated here
are made in a far more agonistic manner. Rather than produce something
like a "postcolonial-realism," [this]{.underline} argument [involves
pushing contemporary realist scholarship toward **new research agendas**
and **new forms of critique**]{.underline} that both capture a spirit
internal to its own traditions while confronting the realities of
contemporary global politics. It engages with minor positions along the
realist canon to orient today's realism away from the logic of great
power politics operating under anarchy toward an understanding of how
the logic of liberal order permits forms of imperial intervention.
Needless to say, [drawing together realist and postcolonial
thought]{.underline}, as this essay has done, [can be met with
**analytical skepticism** and **political hostility**. [A mode of
argumentation that **refuses comparisons**]{.mark} of theoretical cores
or non-truncated readings of select theorists [strikes a note of
**analytical evasion**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To this there is no
defense---other than that already discussed at length. On the other
hand, if the expressly political purpose of this work is accepted, the
argument anticipates strong political reservations: why align the
project of postcolonial theory with realism, an unethical tradition of
militarism and realpolitik? To this I would respond that while a kind of
strategic essentialism has its place, [[**reducing** "realists"]{.mark}
to a coherent body of thought [not only **obscures**]{.mark} **the
[complexity]{.mark}** of their thinking]{.underline} (see never-ending
interpretations of Machiavelli as an example) [[but **reproduces the
narrative** ]{.mark}**of transhistorical unity** [that some realists use
to **authorize unethical policy programs**]{.mark} in the first
place]{.underline}. More critically, however, [in embodying an
**[unproductive ahistoricism]{.mark}**, it [poses]{.mark} conventional
[realist categories of **anarchy**, **selfinterest**, and **military
power** as the]{.mark} political **[problem to confront]{.mark}**
[whereas the present]{.mark} historical [context **demands attunement**
to how]{.mark} some of [these drives]{.mark}]{.underline} (militarism,
national interest) [**[connect with discrete problems]{.mark}** of
liberalism and imperial practices]{.underline}. In fact, there are good
reasons to think that the dominance of (neo)realism in IR is overstated
(Walker and Morton 2005; Maliniak et al. 2011) and that the ascension of
liberal IR theory is sociologically tied up with the present hegemony of
a US liberal world order (Sterling-Folker 2015). In other words, while
realism may have been a productive foil in Cold War bipolarity, we must
theorize from the present. In doing so, we may find that [[countering
imperial formations **may benefit from** ]{.mark}resonances established
not just among postcolonial, feminist, poststructural, and other
"critical" theorists but contemporary [realists who identify links
between **liberalism** and **imperialism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Walt
2013). Indeed, [[if realism]{.mark} as a policy program defending the
national interest [is **entangled with**]{.mark} **current
militaristic** and [imperial **interventions**, we should **push the
premise**]{.mark} of this statement, [that **difference should be
defended**, in **anti-imperial**]{.mark} and **prudential
[directions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Doing so may allow new openings to
emerge in the present sense of closure, new strategies to think and
defend alternative politics. In this way, we may more fully embody
postcoloniality by not being satisfied with either narrow critique or
brash conversion but rather attentive translation.

#### Prefer realist ethics -- accepting the uncertainty of anarchy creates the conditions of possibility for contingent ethical decision-making that embraces the incalculability of life -- reject their deterministic framing

**[Derrida's notion of]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** violent
**[[opening]{.mark} of [ethics]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[fits]{.underline}**]{.mark} remarkably **[well [with
the]{.mark}]{.underline}** two [**[core assumptions]{.underline}**
**[of]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Waltz's theory]{.underline}** of
international politics: [**[the]{.underline}** **[anarchic
structure]{.underline}** **[of the]{.underline}**]{.mark} international
political [**[system]{.underline}** **[and states']{.underline}**
**[desire to survive]{.underline}**]{.mark} within this system. On this
basis, it can be argued that there is, indeed, **[an ethics of
neorealism]{.underline}**. **[It is found in the]{.underline}**
'**[Waltzian baseline']{.underline}** **[rather than in attempts to use
that baseline]{.underline}** to establish law-like patterns of
behaviour.12 To grasp the ethics of neorealism, it is therefore
necessary to shift focus from causal laws and testable hypotheses, to
the structural conditions that shape and affect the behaviour of states
in a non-deterministic manner.13 Hence, the
**[['structure']{.underline}]{.mark}** in Waltz's theory **[has to be
grasped as an open structure]{.underline}** **[that [leaves]{.mark}
ample [room for]{.mark}]{.underline}** chance and
**[[contingency]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Crucially, **[if we could
know]{.underline}** for certain **[what states will do]{.underline}** on
the basis of either the structure of the system or some predetermined
motives of the subjects within the system, **[the
uncertainty]{.underline}** **[of international life would
disappear]{.underline}** and the 'politics' of international politics
would lose its meaning.14 **[Rather than trying to rectify the lack of
certainty]{.underline}** **[by creating a stronger sense of certainty,
[it is]{.mark}]{.underline}** therefore [**[imperative]{.underline}**
**[to]{.underline}** ***[affirm]{.underline}***]{.mark} the
**[[uncertainties]{.mark} created by the system]{.underline}**. **[It is
important,]{.underline}** moreover, [**[to oppose the distinction
between]{.underline}** **[ethical desirability]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** **[political possibility]{.underline}**]{.mark},
**[since [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** reproduction of this
[**[distinction]{.underline}** **[blocks]{.underline}**]{.mark} from
view **[the conditions of]{.underline}** international life that make
**[[ethical thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}** and action possible **[in
the first place]{.underline}**. Positivist social science and liberal
interpretations of Kant are thus, very crudely put, the main obstacles
to grasping the ethics of international life. In resisting both moves,
**[[neorealism does not]{.mark} seek to [close
down]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** violent **[opening of
[ethics]{.mark} inherent in the structure of anarchy,]{.underline}** for
example, **[[by]{.mark} formulating metaphysical ideals]{.underline}**
**[[informing states how they *should*]{.mark} act or how they *ought*
to become friends rather than enemies]{.underline}**. **[[There can be
no absolute friendship]{.underline}]{.mark}** between states, **[[and no
state can ever offer absolute hospitality]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
another state. **[[At the heart of every]{.underline}]{.mark}**
inter-state [**[relation]{.underline}**, **[there
is]{.underline}**]{.mark} mistrust, uncertainty and
**[[incalculability]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[To positively affirm the
latter]{.underline}** **[is not to say that
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** or incalculability **[is good per
se.]{.underline}** Rather, **[it implies that they
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** seen as **[[basic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[irrefutable]{.underline}** **[[conditions of international
life,]{.underline}]{.mark}** which, consequently, are not even desirable
to overcome. Hence, it also implies that as long as there is
international life, there must be 'the ominous shadow of the future
\[that\] continues to cast its pall over interacting states' (Waltz,
2000: 39). Crucially, Waltz's reference to this shadow should not be
read as an expression of determinism. It expresses rather an affirmation
of uncertainty: the 'uncertainty of each about the other's future
intentions and actions' (Waltz, 1979: 105). In order to give friendship
in international politics a chance, so to speak, the possibility that a
friend suddenly becomes an enemy must never be eliminated. Attempts to
create absolute trust in inter-state relations are therefore not only
impossible to achieve in the practical sense, but essentially
undesirable.15 Along similar lines, Derrida explains how friendship is
possible only if one remains open to the deception of the other, since
it is precisely the unconditional openness to whatever may happen in the
encounter between self and other that makes it possible to develop any
sort of friendship in the first place (Derrida, 2005: 219). Even if we
were to accept Alexander Wendt's (1999) distinction between different
'cultures of anarchy', some of which are more 'friendly' than others, it
is not self-evident that a culture in which friendship is prioritized
over enmity is actually a better one. This is because in order to
exclude the possibility that a friend may suddenly become an enemy, one
must first eliminate the time of international life that makes the
self--other encounter possible in the first place. For the same reason,
the key message of democratic peace theory --- that all states should
become democracies in order to minimize or eliminate the possibility of
wars --- is not only practically impossible, but also ethically
undesirable. It is impossible to verify because there is no democracy
that is immune to corruptibility (Waltz, 2000: 10), but, in addition to
that, it can be seen as undesirable since the notion that all states
must conform to the same universal ideal cancels out their freedom to
act, to take moral responsibility and so on. The undesirability of a
system that eradicates violence, borders and discrimination is further
underlined by Waltz (1979: 111--114) in his discussion of the 'virtues
of anarchy'. Therein, he attacks the idea of transforming the
international system into a world government. Not only would such a
transformation 'be an invitation to prepare for world civil war' (Waltz,
1979: 112), but it would take away the constitutive violence at the
heart of inter-state relations in the structure of anarchy. The constant
possibility of war in the international system means that states will
always be wary of provoking others in the search for security. As he
puts it: The constant possibility that force will be used limits
manipulations, moderates demands, and serves as an incentive for the
settlement of disputes. One who knows that pressing too hard may lead to
war has strong reason to consider whether possible gains are worth the
risks entailed.... The possibility that conflicts among nations may lead
to long and costly wars has ... sobering effects. (Waltz, 1979:
113--114) In this way, **[the [conditions of
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}** in the international system **[can be said
to [rest on the constant possibility of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[In making this point]{.underline}**, **[[Waltz argues *against* moral
universalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Hence, unwittingly or otherwise,
**[[he]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**[opens up space for ethical
negotiation]{.underline}** **[by recognizing the finitude of the
political subject]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[who is free to interact
with others only on the condition that self and other do not have to
conform to the 'same' universal ideal]{.underline}**. **[The subject
is]{.underline}** thus **[able to take moral
responsibility]{.underline}** **[and ponder on how to make ethical
decisions]{.underline}**, which, without difference and alterity, would
turn into a strictly formal procedure based on the 'mechanical
application of rules' (Zehfuss, 2009: 146). Responsibility and ethical
decisions are, thus, made possible precisely by the impossibility of
predetermining what is the 'right' decision in any given context. As
Derrida argues, irrespective of how thorough the decision-making
procedure is, and regardless of how much knowledge is acquired before
taking a decision: the instant of the decision, if there is to be a
decision, must be heterogeneous to this accumulation of knowledge.
Otherwise, there is no responsibility. In this sense only must the
person taking the decision not know everything. Even if one knows
everything, the decision, if there is one, must advance toward a future
that is not known, that cannot be anticipated. (Derrida, 2002b: 231) The
impossibility of anchoring the decision in rational calculation is, in
this sense, what creates the chance for any decisions to be taken at
all. The instant of the decision belongs, then, not to a fully present
moment in which the subject calculates the future consequences of the
decision, but to a future that is incalculable (see Derrida, 2002a). It
is precisely this incalculability, and the uncertainty of the future,
that Waltz's conception of anarchy positively affirms. Rather than
making the instant of the decision obsolete by transforming the decision
into a mere application of rules, anarchy makes the ethical decision
'possible'. **[Even if Waltz]{.underline}** repeatedly
**[claims]{.underline}** that **[the desire to survive is]{.underline}**
a **[purely pragmatic]{.underline}** assumption made strictly for the
purpose of constructing an explanatory theory, **[it is not
neutral]{.underline}** or innocent. First and foremost, Waltzian
**[[neorealism expresses]{.mark} an [ethics due]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[to the way it]{.mark} affirms states' desire to
survive]{.underline}** **[by stipulating]{.underline}** the necessary
**[conditions of their survival]{.underline}**. **[More
precisely]{.underline}**, **[it [affirms the uncertainty of
international life]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[by refusing to
reduce]{.mark} the play of [relations]{.mark} between states [to a
calculable formula]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[or a regulative
ideal]{.underline}**, **[[and]{.mark} that rather [embraces]{.mark}
chance and [contingency]{.mark} as central features of the anarchic
system]{.underline}** --- features that make states simultaneously free
and insecure.16 **[In this light, the primary significance of Waltz's
theory]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** not as an explanatory theory,
but **[as a theory that affirms the time of international
life]{.underline}**, **[defined by the uncertainty of the
future]{.underline}** **[and the logic of the erasable mortal
trace]{.underline}**.17 **[It is [this]{.mark} notion of the future that
[makes it possible for states]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[as finite
political subjects]{.underline}**, **[not only to
survive]{.underline}**, **[but also [to]{.mark} try to take moral
responsibility and [make ethical decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Why
universal ethical ideals are both impossible and undesirable What are
the implications of my reading of Waltzian neorealism as an ethics?
First of all, **[it []{.mark}contributes]{.underline}** to **[a new
understanding of the difficulties]{.underline}** inherent **[in any
attempt to theorize what it might mean to replace the structure of
anarchy]{.underline}** **[with an]{.underline}** international or world
political **[order]{.underline}** **[that is supposedly 'more'
ethical]{.underline}**. **[[If ethics is]{.mark} inextricably
[interlinked]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[with]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
structural **[conditions of [survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**, then
**[any attempt [to challenge neorealism]{.mark}]{.underline}** from an
'ethical' perspective **[[must do so by replacing one structure of
survival with another]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[and [there can be no
guarantees that the new structure will be less
violent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[While [this]{.mark} does
not]{.underline}** in any way **[prevent such attempts from being
made]{.underline}**, **[it does [highlight the risky nature of trying to
resolve]{.mark} problems of [war and violence]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
international politics **[[on ethical terms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For
example, the idea of creating a new form of political community that
transcends the exclusionary borders of states may seem naturally
desirable (e.g. Linklater, 1982). Yet, regardless of how sophisticated
theories become in terms of articulating the content and meaning of such
a community, there can be no guarantees that attempts to actualize it
will not result in even more violence. **[[There are no
guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as John Mearsheimer (1994: 44) puts
it, **[[that 'a fascist discourse far more violent than realism will not
emerge]{.mark} as the new hegemonic discourse']{.underline}**.

#### Realism is necessary and inevitable -- we must deal with how states actually act based on the international system, not how we wish they would

**Parsi 05** \[Trita, founder and president of the National Iranian
American Council, "Israel-Iranian Relations Assessed: Strategic
Competition from the Power Cycle Perspective", in Homa Katouzian and

[Realism is the dominating paradigm in international relations.
Characterized by its hard-boiled willingness to see the world as it is
and study international relations as an objective reality]{.underline},
it lacks normative guiding principles. [It deals with what is and not
with what ought to be.]{.underline} Using the metaphor of anarchy to
describe the international system, realists argue that [the only order
is that which emerges from competition between states-the system\'s
principal actors under anarchy.]{.underline} Realists posit that states
are rational actors whose primary purpose is to secure their own
survival, irrespective of their internal political makeup. Security, in
turn, is achieved by maximizing power. In the words of Kenneth Waltz,
[the international system is a self-help system in which a nation\'s
security cannot be ensured except through their own
actions.]{.underline}18 Yet, it is not a world of constant conflict.
Stein describes the realist worldview as not necessarily one of
perpetual warfare, but of perpetual conflict since crises are recurring
and inevitable.19 Tracing their intellectual lineage to Machiavelli and
Thucydides, realists refrain from putting their faith in international
law and institutions, arguing that treaties cannot affect the
fundamental principles of international relations. Neo-realism shares
the basic assumptions of realism, but takes a systemic approach and
emphasizes the structure of the international system and its affect on
the interacting units and vice versa. Waltz posits that [a system is
composed of a structure and interacting units in which the definition of
the structure is free of the attributes and the interactions of the
units. The maneuverability of the states is limited by the structure of
the system, which constitutes the setting in which states
interact.]{.underline}

### 2AC Threats Real

#### Examining whether threats are real and whether our security responses are ethical is the only effective middle ground

**Floyd '19** \[Rita, Department of Political Science and International
Studies Senior Lecturer in Conflict and Security, "Introduction" in The
Morality of Security, Cambridge Core, April 2019, pp 10-12,
<https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108667814>\]

Securitization has been heavily debated in the scholarly community.
Among other things much discussion has focused on the issue of whether
securitization is satisfied simply by audience acceptance of the
securitizing move, or whether it has to involve extraordinary measures
(Balzacq, Le´onard and Ruzicka, 2015). All securitization scholars
accept, however, that security threats are socially and politically
constructed, or in other words that: 'Security issues are made security
issues by acts of securitization' (Buzan et al., 1998: 204). This has
allowed scholars to recognize what Jef Huysmans calls 'the political
force of security' whereby '\[s\]ecurity is a practice not of responding
to enemies and fear but of creating them' (2014: 3). [An **[exclusive
focus on the]{.mark} [constructedness of security
means]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, **[that [securitization
scholars]{.mark} tend to [ignore whether]{.mark}]{.underline}** or not
the **[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** that inform securitization
**[[are real]{.underline}]{.mark}** or otherwise. And as Thierry Balzacq
argues, [[this has]{.mark} had [the disadvantage of]{.mark}
securitization scholars [overlooking the fact that securitizing moves
that refer to 'brute threats']{.mark} are more likely to [succeed
because]{.mark}, 'to win an audience, security [statements must]{.mark},
usually, [be related to an external reality']{.mark}]{.underline}
(2011b: 13). Balzacq's observation is important in the context of this
book as it goes some way towards paving the way for the inclusion of
objective existential threats into securitization analysis. As I will
argue in this book, [real threats are important for the purposes of just
securitization theory]{.underline} as only these may constitute a just
reason19 for securitization. The Copenhagen School's refusal to 'peek
behind \[threat construction\] to decide whether it is really a threat'
(Buzan et al., 1998: 204) and the just war tradition's insistence on
real threats as just causes, appear to suggest insurmountable
differences at the meta-theoretical level between the two theories.
Importantly, however, [the Copenhagen School's unwillingness
to]{.underline}, as they put it, '[peek behind' threat construction,
does not stem from a denial that real threats exist]{.underline} (after
all Wæver (2011: 472) recognizes that 'lots of real threats exist'),20
but from the belief that the study of threat construction is ultimately
more fruitful than pondering the presence of real threats (Buzan and
Hansen, 2009: 213; Buzan et al., 1998: 204). Beyond this, the decision
not to try and examine whether security threats refer to real threats is
also -- at least in part -- driven by a strong normative conviction.
Thus [by focusing on the political force of security as opposed to
whether or not threats are real]{.underline}, Wæver and [the Copenhagen
School highlight the fact that securitization is/was not
inevitable]{.underline}; things could have been treated in a different
way (for example, perceived threats could have been criminalized or
simply politicized). This enables scholars following this logic to
highlight that securitizing actors bear responsibility for framing
things in this way. Wæver calls this 'the politics of responsibility'
(2011: 472), which he explains as follows: 'The securitization approach
points to the inherently political nature of any designation of security
issues and thus it puts an ethical question at the feet of analysts,
decisionmakers and activists alike: why do you call this a security
issue? What are the implications of doing this -- or of not doing it?'
(Wæver 1999 cited in Wæver, 2011: 468; emphasis added). The significance
of the fact that securitization is a political choice cannot be
overstated; however, [it is also the case that
**[decision-makers]{.mark} are likely to [consider securitization the
right]{.mark} political [choice when they believe]{.mark} that [they
are]{.mark} in fact [dealing with a real
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In other words, **[the
possibility of [framing the issue differently will not be tempting if
they believe that there is a real threat]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Given
that the Copenhagen School and their followers cannot tell them anything
about the actual objective existence of the threat, **[the framework
seems of limited persuasiveness]{.mark}**]{.underline} here[; **it is
simply the securitizing actor's belief against the scholar's argument
that things could and perhaps should be different**]{.underline}. Indeed
the Copenhagen School recognizes 'our inability to counter
securitization (say, of immigrants) with an argument that this is not
really a security problem or that the environment is a bigger security
problem' as the securitization approach's 'main disadvantage' (Buzan et
al., 1998: 206). I propose that [if the ethical goal of securitization
analysis is that securitizing actors take responsibility for their
actions]{.underline}, [then a better strategy is to begin
by]{.underline} (helping them in) [judging the objective existence of a
threat,]{.underline} because unless there is a real threat,
securitization is most definitely the wrong political and ethical
choice. Importantly, however, as I argue in this book, the existence of
a real threat does not automatically necessitate securitization (indeed
this remains a political choice), neither does it -- by itself -- render
it morally permissible; the presence of real threats is rather one
important requirement for securitization to be justified. In other
words, just securitization is informed by the idea that [[securitizing
actors]{.mark} are not only responsible for choosing to securitize, they
[ought to be **responsible for securitizing in an ethical
manner**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In my view, the fact that the original
variant of securitization theory excludes objective existential threats
not on ontological, but at least partially on normative grounds means
that a variant of securitization theory that includes real threats is at
least permissible, provided, of course, that a theoretical framework
that shows how we can know that threats are real is delivered. In this
book, such a framework is set out in Chapter 2. 21 \[FOOTNOTE 21 BEGINS
1 [[Some]{.mark} scholars [may object to]{.mark} the possibility of
[combining insights of opposed theories on the grounds of
inconsistency]{.mark}]{.underline} -- for example, critical security
studies, with its postmodern roots, with insights gained from
analytical, moral and political philosophy. Interestingly, Wæver has
faced similar charges of inconsistency for combining elements that
ordinarily don't go together (notably, Wæver refers to himself as a
poststructural realist). To these critics Wæver offers this persuasive
riposte: '[[This]{.mark} criticism [presupposes]{.mark} that these
[larger groups are internally consistent]{.mark} and mutually
isolated]{.underline}. On the contrary, [we all know numerous examples
of [internally consistent theories]{.mark} that [draw on several
traditions]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and many more examples of theories
that stay within their "box" and yet are horribly inconsistent.
Therefore, [investigations of the internal consistency and productivity
of research traditions should focus on distinct theories, not loose
collections hereof']{.underline} (Wæver, 2015:124). Generally speaking,
I am critical of the tendency to confuse theory with ideology, and thus
disallowing and discounting anything outside of one's perceived and
tightly regulated theoretical remit. In the past in IR such thinking has
led to bad scholarship; thankfully [now scholars are working to dispel
artificially imposed dichotomies, such as that on the relationship
between causation and discourse]{.underline} (Kurki, 2008). FOOTNOTE 21

#### Some threats are real and not constructed -- action is key to prevent them

**Knudsen 1** \[Olav, PoliSci Professor at Sodertorn, Post-Copenhagen
Security Studies, Security Dialogue 32:3\]

Moreover, I have a problem with the underlying implication that it is
unimportant whether states \'really\' face dangers from other states or
groups. [In the Copenhagen school, threats are seen as coming mainly
from the actors\' own fears]{.underline}, or from what happens when the
fears of individuals turn into paranoid political action. In my view,
[this [emphasis on the subjective is a **misleading conception of
threat**, in that it discounts an independent existence for what- ever
is perceived as a threat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Granted, [political life
is often marked by misperceptions]{.underline}, mistakes, pure
imaginations, ghosts, or mirages, [but [such phenomena **do not occur
simultaneously**]{.mark} to large numbers of politicians, and **hardly
most of the time**. [During the Cold War, threats - in the sense of
plausible possibilities of danger - referred to \'real\' phenomena, and
they **refer to \'real\' phenomena** now.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
objects referred to are often not the same, but that is a different
matter. Threats have to be dealt with both ín terms of perceptions and
in terms of the phenomena which are perceived to be threatening. [The
point of Waever's concept of security is not the potential existence of
danger somewhere but the use of the word itself by political
elites.]{.underline} In his 1997 PhD dissertation, he writes, 'One can
View "security" as that which is in language theory called a speech act:
it is not interesting as a sign referring to something more real - it is
the utterance itself that is the act.'24 The deliberate disregard of
objective factors is even more explicitly stated in Buzan & WaeVer's
joint article of the same year." As a consequence, [t[he phenomenon of
threat is reduced to a matter of pure domestic politics." It seems to me
that the security dilemma, as a central notion in security studies, then
loses its foundation]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Yet I see that
Waever himself has no compunction about referring to the security
dilemma in a recent article.\" This discounting of the objective aspect
of threats shifts security studies to insignificant concerns. [[What has
long made \'threats\' and 'threat perceptions' important phenomena in
the study of IR is the implication that **urgent action may be
required**.]{.mark} Urgency, of course, is where Waever first began his
argument in favor of an alternative security conception, because [a
convincing sense of urgency has been the chief culprit behind the abuse
of \'security\' and the consequent 'politics of panic\']{.mark}, as
Waever aptly calls it.]{.underline}" Now, here - in the case of
urgency - another baby is thrown out with the Waeverian bathwater. [When
real situations of urgency arise, those situations are challenges to
democracy; they are actually at the core of the problematic arising with
the process of making security policy in parliamentary democracy. But in
Waever's world, threats are merely more or less persuasive, and the
claim of urgency is just another argument. I hold that instead of
\'abolishing\' threatening phenomena 'out there' by reconceptualizing
them, as Waever does, we should continue paying attention to them,
[because **situations with a credible claim to urgency will keep coming
back** and then we need to know more about how they work in the
interrelations of groups and states (]{.mark}]{.underline}such as civil
wars, for instance), [[not least to find adequate democratic procedures
for dealing with them.]{.underline}]{.mark}

maximize their prospects for survival]{.underline}**. In particular,
**[they try to gauge the preferences of other states and how their own
behavior is likely to affect the actions of those other states, as well
as how the behavior of those other states is likely to affect their own
strategy]{.underline}**. When they look at the different strategies that
they have to choose between, they assess the likelihood of success as
well as the costs and benefits of each one. Finally, states pay
attention not only to the immediate consequences of their actions, but
to the long-term effects as well. Nevertheless, **[rational states
miscalculate from time to time because they invariably make important
decisions on the basis of imperfect information]{.underline}**. **[They
hardly ever have complete information about any situation they confront,
which forces them to make educated guesses. This is due in part to the
fact that potential adversaries have incentives to misrepresent their
own strength or weakness, and to conceal their true aims.]{.underline}**
But even if disinformation were not a problem, **[states are often
unsure about the resolve of opposing forces as well as their allies, and

### 2AC AT Root Cause

#### Monocausal, ideological explanations of international relations fail and obscure the proximate dynamics that causal war and violence.

**Rotter 8** \[Andrew, Colgate history professor. 2008. "The Cultural
History of Foreign Relations" in A Companion to American Cultural
History, pp. 430-3\]

Studies on cultural transmission have opened diplomatic history to new
subjects and new interpretations, and constructively complicated its
assumptions about what constitutes foreign relations. Some culturalists
believe, however, that studies of fashion, tourism, and musical theater
fail to address real power relations between nations. Fashion and
tourism and musicals, they say, may reveal something about one people's
attitudes toward another; but to understand why nations behave as they
do, it is essential to bring the state back into the analysis.
[[How]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, [[do]{.underline}]{.mark} such
cultural [analysands as [**race, gender, and language** help]{.mark} us
[parse hard power]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [including the **mechanics of
empire and**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[the conduct of
[war?]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[Can the]{.mark} Geertzian [approach
explain]{.mark} not just]{.underline} the [context but]{.underline} the
content, and [even]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[cause/effect, of US foreign relations?]{.underline}]{.mark}** [To be
sure, many of the previously cited books]{.underline} do [concern power;
and the distinction between "cultural transmission" and "culture as
power" may be artificial]{.underline}. Let us consider several specifi c
ways in which historians have tried directly to connect attitudes,
images, values, and prejudices to the practice of foreign policy, and
the exercise of state power. [Begin with race]{.underline}. For some
years, [scholars have noted that]{.underline} white racism [has
influenced US policy]{.underline} toward non-white others. For Michael
Hunt, racism is one of three main elements of American ideology (1987).
Reginald Horsman (1981) and Richard Slotkin (1985) have shown that white
acceptance of racist social science during the nineteenth century
enabled brutal treatment of Native Americans, Mexicans, and Filipinos,
among others. John Dower's War Without Mercy (1986), a harrowing account
of the Pacifi c War, demonstrates that white Americans and Japanese
killed and maimed each other remorselessly because of their mutual
racism. During the Cold War, US policy toward Africa was guided in part
by the assumption that black Africans were unready for, and perhaps
incapable of, self-government. In South Africa (Borstelmann 1993),
Zimbabwe (Horne 2001), and all across the African continent (Noer 1985),
white Americans sheltered too long and lovingly racist white minority
governments that frustrated black aspirations to democracy. [Domestic
race relations also played a role]{.underline} in US foreign policy. The
rising civil rights movement after 1945 exposed American racism and
embarrassed a succession of presidents trying to win the Cold War with
the claim that communists represented tyranny, the Americans and their
allies freedom. African Americans often identifi ed with black freedom
fi ghters in Africa, and vice versa, as both groups struggled against
white power structures that denigrated and oppressed them. African
Americans spoke out against racism at home and racist colonialism
abroad, prompting State Department offi cial (and later secretary of
state) Dean Rusk to admit that race discrimination in the United States
was "the biggest single burden that we carry" into the arena of
diplomacy. A good deal of scholarly attention has been paid recently to
the impact of domestic race relations on US policy making (Horne 1986;
Plummer 1996; Von Eschen 1997; Krenn 1999; Dudziak 2000; Gallicchio
2000; Borstelmann 2001; Anderson 2003). [Along with race, gender has
increasingly become an important analysand]{.underline} for historians
of foreign relations. Joan Scott's infl uential essay "Gender: A Useful
Category of Historical Analysis," fi rst published in 1986, questioned
why historians seemed to think that gender was "irrelevant to . . .
issues of politics and power"; in her view, "high politics itself is a
gendered concept" (Scott 1996: 48). Emily Rosenberg responded to this
challenge (1990) and gradually thereafter, [foreign relations historians
began to apply gender analysis to their studies of diplomacy,
imperialism, and war]{.underline}. Some saw gender as a way to consider
the role of women in international encounters, as occasional makers of
policy (Jeffreys-Jones 1995), as agents of foreign relations through
non-governmental organizations (Tyrrell 1991), or as those on the
receiving end of imperial power (Enloe 1990; Moon 1997; Findlay 1999;
Goedde 2003; Shibusawa 2006). Some studies of gender included
consideration of sexuality and/or race. [Other scholarship]{.underline}
involving gender [has concerned]{.underline} [the role played
by]{.underline} cultural [constructions of the masculine and the
feminine in shaping images of selves and others in US foreign
policy]{.underline}. The United States has typically seen itself as a
masculine nation, honor-bound to protect allegedly feminine others, or
to discipline those whose fl ighty and effeminate misbehavior threatens
international stability. The quest for manliness has been associated
with certain American presidents; as Kristin Hoganson has written,
"historians have turned Theodore Roosevelt into a virtual poster boy for
the utility of gender in foreign relations history" (Hoganson 1998;
Bederman 1995; Dalton 2002). Frank Costigliola has discovered signifi
cance in the gendered language of Cold Warrior George Kennan, who
repeatedly warned against the "penetration" of the "West" by Soviet
expansionism (Costigliola 1997). The fear of appearing soft on communism
drove John F. Kennedy to insist on masculine toughness in his policy
toward the Soviet Union and Vietnam (Dean 2001). Other historians have
claimed that the United States is periodically seized by a "crisis of
masculinity" that fi nds an outlet in an aggressive foreign policy,
regardless of who is president. Rendering international others as
feminine has enabled the United States, and other imperial nations, to
naturalize or justify interference in others' affairs. Paternalism
guided US policy toward Latin America and the Caribbean; the North
Americans sought to control allegedly fl ighty and emotional Haitians,
Cubans, and Puerto Ricans (Renda 2001; Perez 1998; Findlay 1999). The
annals of US foreign relations are populated by tremulous Chinese,
cowering Hindus, tough Muslims and weeping Muslims, manly Israelis,
effete Frenchmen, and so forth. The "tough" and "manly" won praise and
support from the United States. The "weak" and "soft" required fi rm,
masculine guidance. If [foreign relations historians]{.underline} have
confi rmed that gender is "a useful category of historical analysis"
even within realms of power, they [have nevertheless found that
**[gender alone, like race alone, has explanatory
limits]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The challenge]{.mark} for
historians]{.underline}, as Hoganson puts it, [["is shifting from
demonstrating]{.mark} the **[relevance]{.mark}** of gender [to
situating]{.mark} gender [**alongside strategic, economic, political,
and other factors**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (1998: 316). Some historians
have opened their cultural analysis to a greater number of variables, by
looking carefully at the language of foreign policy makers or those
groups that influence them. Language, particularly in its metaphors, can
convey a host of meanings infl ected by the culture that produces it.
Kennan's language in his famous "Long Telegram" (1946) was gendered --
it feminized the Russian people, for whom Kennan had an almost sexual
affection, and cast as rapacious the current Soviet leadership -- but it
also indulged in references to illness, as in the "Kremlin's neurotic
view of world affairs" and Soviet leaders being "affl icted" with
insecurity (Costigliola 1997). Geoffrey Smith has associated gender,
pathology, and perceptions of national security in his explanation of
the Red (fear of communism) and Lavender (fear of gay people) Scares
that swept the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s (Smith
1992). Homosexuality was purportedly a sexual perversion, a disease, and
a risk to national security because gays were readily blackmailed by
their communist handlers. [Increasingly, [historians of foreign
relations]{.mark} are **[try]{.mark}**ing [to do justice
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[complexity]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
culture [[and the **disparate ways** it affects]{.mark} perception and
[decision making]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[It is never neat]{.mark}**
work]{.underline}. [[Who is to say, for example, whether race or
religion **more insistently** conditioned US policy toward]{.mark}
Muslim [Pakistan and]{.mark} Hindu [India]{.mark}]{.underline} during
the 1950s[[?]{.underline} [How did]{.underline}]{.mark} [interwoven
ideas concerning [gender, race, and class shape]{.mark} North American
[initiatives in Puerto Rico or Cuba]{.mark}]{.underline} at the
beginning of the twentieth century[[?]{.underline}]{.mark} [A number of
scholars have skillfully blended]{.underline} the [discrete
elements]{.underline} of culture [to offer satisfying
explanations]{.underline} of American encounters with others (Stephanson
1995; Dower 1999; Bradley 2000; Connelly 2002; Klein 2003). [The most
direct result of the poststructural challenge to]{.underline} the
history of US [foreign relations]{.underline} [has been the emergence of
postcolonial or subaltern studies]{.underline}, a movement closely
associated with the late Edward Said, whose Orientalism (1978) was its
foundation text. Postcolonial scholars admired Marx and especially the
Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, but revealed their poststructural affi
liations through their interest in literature, subjectivity, prisons,
schools, and discourse, and through their footnotes, which cited more
Foucault than Marx. The postcolonialists were emphatically interested in
empire and power. While they were clear in their condemnation of
colonialism, they looked imaginatively at the relationships empire
created between the dominant nation, its agents, and colonized
"subalterns" (Subaltern Studies, 1988-- 2000). Perhaps the most
important contribution of the subaltern scholars was their ascription of
agency to the weaker parties in the colonial relationship -- men and
women who, in spite of having limited power, shaped their own identities
and forged resistance despite their subordinate status. [Gender
and]{.underline} often [race figure]{.underline}d [prominently in these
works]{.underline}. Said and the Subaltern Studies quickly found their
way into the arguments (and the footnotes) of foreign relations
culturalists. Essays in Cultures of United States Imperialism (Kaplan &
Pease 1993) used poststructural theory to expand the horizons of
historians more comfortable sorting through diplomatic correspondence
than contemplating the prosthetics of empire, stuffed gorillas at New
York's Museum of Natural History, and Tokyo Disneyland -- all subjects
of essays in the Kaplan--Pease anthology. As Rosenberg has noted, much
of the foreign relations history inspired by poststructuralism has
focused on the formal American empire: on the Philippines, and
especially on Latin America (Joseph et al. 1998; Rosenberg 1999; Rafael
2000; Renda 2001). Adopting postmodern theory, regarding empire as an
engagement of cultures, and exploring mutual images and attitudes as
displayed in the media, in fi ction, and in travel literature, these
scholars have nevertheless combed the archives in search of affi
liations between the offi cial language of diplomacy and the broader
discourse of encounter. It would be satisfying to report that
culturalism has swept the field, and achieved the stature of realist,
revisionist, or even post-revisionist accounts of US foreign relations.
There is no question that culturalism has gained a measure of respect,
certainly among younger entrants to the fi eld, and with some older
scholars as well. Yet resistance remains. Some seems churlish: that
cultural infl uence is harder to measure than, say, trade fl ows during
the 1930s is self-evident, and hardly disqualifi es culture as a
meaningful category of analysis. But there is thoughtful criticism as
well. [Culture is an elastic concept; if it includes and explains
everything, it threatens to explain nothing in particular]{.underline}.
[[Culture]{.mark}, moreover, [can **occlude the operations of cause and
effect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Exploring how selves see themselves
[and]{.mark} others **[does not necessarily illuminate *why* selves or
others *act* as they do]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[And]{.mark}**
cultural [perceptions]{.mark} are likely to **[depend on
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[Americans during the Pacific
War]{.mark} hated and [dehumanized the **Japanese**, but **cherished the
Chinese**]{.mark}]{.underline} as honest, virtuous, and quaint. [[Above
all]{.underline}]{.mark}, critics have charged, culture in the end has
not much to do with power. Oppression is not, they say, about ridicule,
stereotype, or ideas based on gender, race, or religion. **[[Language
does not kill people; war is not a discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [In
its affection for Geertzian context]{.underline}, [its [emphasis on
image]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[culturalism neglects what is most
important about US foreign relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### Root cause logic is reductive and false ---it subverts change

**Morson 7** \[Gary, Professor of Slavic Studies, Russian Literature and
History at Northwestern, "Anna Karenina In Our Time: Seeing More
Wisely," P. 152-4\]

If Levin resembled so may [[intellectuals]{.underline}]{.mark} in his
time and ours, he might [[seek "root cause"]{.underline}]{.mark} (as we
would call it today) of all these failures. Much as the generals an
historians satirized in War and Peace mistakenly seek the cause of
historical events in a single decision, an much as
[[revolutionaries]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[reduce the complexities
of social ills to a single conspiracy or
institution]{.underline}]{.mark}, so **[intellectuals]{.underline}**
often **[[view complexity as a delusion to be explained away by a few
simple underlying laws. It is just this habit of thought that feeds
utopianism]{.mark}, because if the diversity of evil an misery had a
single cause, then one could eliminate it by changing only one thing
What could be easier? [Abolish private
property]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} alter the way children are
educated, pass laws to regulate morals according to a given code, [[and
evil will disappear]{.underline}]{.mark} or, at least, radically
diminish. Behold, I make all new things But Levin learns that there is
no single cause for what has gone wrong. **[Looking back on the
twentieth century]{.underline}**, we may wonder whether [[the root cause
of the worst human misery is the belief that there is a root cause of
human misery.]{.underline}]{.mark} In fact, many things happen
contingently, just "for some reason."¶ Friction¶ When l.evin attends the
elections, he tries to handle some business for his sister, but
discovers that somehow it cannot be done. In Dostoevsky, the reason
would be \"administrative ecstasy,\" the sheer delight bureaucrats take
in making petitioners cringe, plead, or wait. But nothing of the sort
happens here, and the problem is not one of intent at all. No one has
any interest in thwarting Levin, so he cannot understand what goes
wrong.¶ When conspiracy theorists find they cannot accomplish something
as easily as expected, they typically ask cut bono? (who benefits?) ro
discover the obstacle. Some person or group must have caused the
failure. Defeat means sabotage. This way of thinking presumes that
behind every action there must be an intent,¶ whether conscious or
unconscious. Such a view rules out the possibility that mere contingency
or friction accounts for the difficulty.¶ flic military theorist Carl
von Clauscwitz deemed friction, in this special metaphorical sense, an
essential concept in understanding armies. Without using this word,
Tolstoy regarded the same phenomenon as pertaining not just to war but
to everything social. \"If one has never personally experienced war,\"
Clauscwitz explains,¶ one cannot understand in what difficulties
constantly mentioned really consist. . . . Everything looks simple; the
knowledge required docs not look remarkable, the strategic options are
so obvious that by comparison the simplest problem of higher mathematics
has an impressive scientific dignity. Once war has actually been seen
the difficulties become clear; but it is extremely difficult to describe
the unseen, all-pervading element that brings about this change of
perspective. Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is
difficult. \'Die difficulties accumulate and end by producing a kind of
friction that is inconceivable unless one has experienced war.
(Clausewitz, 119)¶ The unseen, all-pervading element: For Tolstoy,
similar difficulties arise when dealing with bureaucracy, introducing
changes in agriculture, and implementing reforms. A Tolstoyan
perspective is easily imagined today. Social problems look so simple:
people in underdeveloped countries are poor, so give their governments
foreign aid; workers arc unemployed, so hire them to perform needed
government services; schools do not educate, so raise teachers\'
salaries; the state regulatory commission keeps energy prices too high,
so partially privatize the system: answers seem so obvious, but in
practice reforms rarely have the intended effect. They produce
unintended consequences, which themselves have consequences; and, as
Isaiah Berlin liked to point our, no one can foresee the consequences of
consequences of consequences. Experience may teach one to expect certain
kinds of difficulties, but some can never be anticipated, lhcrc is
always friction: \"Countless minor incidents ---the kind you can never
really foresee---combine to lower the general level of performance, so
that one always falls far short of the intended goal\" (Clauscwitz,
119).¶ No one is deliberately impeding Levin\'s efforts for his sister.
By the same token, no one is trying to thwart his agricultural reforms.
Sabotage is out of the question. \"All this happened not because anyone
felt ill will toward Levin or his farm; on the contrary, he knew that
they \[rhe peasants\] liked him \[and\] thought him a simple gentleman
(their highest praise)\" (340).¶ Friction defeats the reforms. But where
does this friction come from and how might one best deal with it?¶ TTic
Elemental Force¶ \'Ihe bailiff and peasants recognize in advance when a
plan is bound to fail, and at lasr l.evin, instead of growing angry,
pays artention to what they say:¶ The bailiff listened attentively, and
obviously made an effort to approve of his employer\'s projects. But
still he had that look Levin knew so well that always irritated him, a
look of hopelessness and despondency. That look said: \" Ihat\'s all
very well, but as God wills.\" Nothing mortified Levin so much as that
tone. But it was common to all the bailiffs he had ever had. They had
all taken up that attitude toward his plans, and so now he was not
angered by it but mortified, and felr all the more roused ro struggle
against this, as it seemed, elemental force continually ranged against
him, for which he could find no other expression than \"as God wills.\"
(165)¶ Ihe elementalforce: this concept is central to both Tolstoy\'s
great novels. Tolstoy uses a few similar terms for it. In War and Peace,
he refers to an elemental force shaping individual lives (W&P, 648) and
to \"the elemental life of the swarm\" constituting the cumulative
effect of countless people\'s small actions governed by no overarching
law. In Anna Karentna, he calls the elemental force a \"brutal force\"
when its outcome is cruel. Ihe rough equivalent of friction for
Clause-witz, the elemental force applies more widely.¶ Clauscwitz\'s
explanation stops at friction, but Tolstoy takes the elemental force as
a starting point for understanding why some plans arc more likely to
fail than others[.¶ **[In order to grasp]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
course of [**[events more easily]{.underline}**,
**[we]{.underline}**]{.mark} tend to [**[reduce]{.underline}** the
[countless infinitesimal forces]{.underline}]{.mark} making up the
elemental force [[to a single cause]{.underline}]{.mark}. After all, it
is impossible to enumerate innumerable actions. And **[so]{.underline}**
historians and [**[social scientists]{.underline}**]{.mark} naturally
[**[look for some]{.underline}** [super-cause that sums up all those
small actions.]{.underline}]{.mark} They may presume laws or postulate
narrative neatness. Tolstoy relentlessly exposed the **[logical
fallacies in]{.underline}** both forms of
[[simplification]{.underline}]{.mark}, which, at some point, either
[[assume what is to be proven or proceed as if it were already
proven]{.underline}]{.mark}. ¶ Historians, **[social
theorists]{.underline}**, and biographers [[favor
generalizations]{.underline}]{.mark} or symmetries [[permitting
a]{.underline}]{.mark} clear analysis or [[simple
story]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[They find what they seek]{.underline}**,
their success demonstrates not that complexity has been adequately
explained but that [[when a discipline demands a certain sort of
explanation it is bound to be "discovered."]{.underline}]{.mark} **[In
disciplines pretending to be social sciences]{.underline}**, it is
repeatedly discovered that things are not as complex as they appear.

## AT Imperialism Stuff

### AT America Imperialist

#### America is not imperial -- calling it such methodologically wrecks our ability to critically understand how American power works

**Walzer 18** \[Michael, Prof Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
*A Foreign Policy for the Left*, epub\]

"Empire" needs extensive qualification if it is to describe anything
like what exists, or what is possible, in the world today. Hence the
appeal of terms like Michael Ignatieff's "empire lite."3 But perhaps
there is a better way of thinking about contemporary global politics,
drawing on the related idea of "[hegemony]{.underline}." In common use
today, "hegemonic" is simply a less vivid way of saying "imperialist,"
but it really [points to something different: a looser form of rule,
less authoritarian than empire is or was and more dependent on the
agreement of others.]{.underline} Consider these words from Antonio
Gramsci, the foremost theorist of hegemony---who wrote in the context of
domestic political struggles: "[The fact of hegemony presupposes that
one takes into account the interests and tendencies of the groups over
which hegemony will be exercised, and it also presupposes a certain
equilibrium]{.underline}, that is to say that the hegemonic groups will
make some sacrifices of a corporate nature."4 Hegemony rests in part on
force, but it rests also, even more importantly, on ideas and
ideologies. If a ruling class has to rely on force alone, it has reached
a crisis in its rule. To avoid that crisis, it has to be prepared for
compromise. In an essay on Gramsci, Stuart Hall provides a more extended
analysis of the "multi-dimensional" character of hegemony (he is still
writing about domestic politics): What "leads" in a period of hegemony
is no longer described as a "ruling class" in the traditional language,
but a historical bloc . . . The "leading" elements in a historical bloc
may be only one fraction of the dominant economic class. . . .
\[A\]ssociated with it, within the "bloc," will be strata of the
subaltern and dominated classes who have been won over by specific
concessions and compromises and who form part of the social
constellation.5 Michael Bérubé comments usefully on this highly abstract
passage: "The import is clear: mastery is not simply imposed or
dominative in character; consent is not simply manufactured by a ruling
class and its monopoly over the means of mental production."6 The
politics of a ruling class is largely internal, a matter of factions and
intrigue; [politics in a hegemonic system]{.underline}, by contrast,
[involves the interaction of independent actors, who must be drawn into
a "bloc" through argument and concession.]{.underline} So the theory of
hegemony provides a view of our political life that comes close to our
everyday perception of its complexity. Exactly how a similar analysis
would work in international society isn't entirely clear, but [hegemony
would certainly require a more complicated understanding than the theory
of imperialism allows.]{.underline} I don't have a fully developed
alternative theory, only the beginning of an argument. Nor do I mean to
suggest that America's recent rulers, who began the Iraq war, actually
accepted the need for "sacrifices of a corporate nature" or for
"concessions and compromises," even when they made them---as they did
with the Turks in 2003 and as the Obama administration, more
self-consciously, has done again with the Turks, and also with the
Saudis, in the ongoing war against ISIS. President George W. Bush's
unilateralism was a bid for [dominance without compromise]{.underline},
which [turns out to be impossible.]{.underline} But [unilateralism
hasn't been the natural mode of American power. Since World War II we
(Americans) have played a major role in shaping international
organizations; we have negotiated alliances, and we have generally been
willing to consult with our allies in responding to critical
events]{.underline} like the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and in dealing
(often reluctantly) with dangerous political or environmental tendencies
like nuclear proliferation and global warming. [The wish to act alone
was an innovation of the second Bush administration]{.underline}---and
was short-lived, or so it seemed, until the election of 2016. [It was
less the product of fear than of arrogance and ideological zeal, and it
reflected a view of American power as inaccurate as that held by many of
President Bush's critics. In the contemporary world, imperial rule is an
exercise in futility]{.underline}---but a dangerous exercise
nonetheless. It is futile in the American case for three reasons. First,
[Americans don't have the stomach for old-fashioned imperialism. We are
radically unready to pay the economic costs of empire]{.underline}---and
empire, when it involves the "microadministrative management of
populations," is expensive: there are profits for corporations like
Bechtel and Halliburton, but only burdens for American taxpayers, who
won't be willing to bear them for long. [Nor will American mothers and
fathers be willing to bear the costs in blood.]{.underline} We don't
have an imperial army made up of "natives" and mercenaries. We have
never created an imperial civil service; we don't even learn the
languages or customs of the countries we mean to rule. [The American
failure to impose law and order across Afghanistan]{.underline}, the
deals the Pentagon made with local warlords (and then didn't enforce),
our government's refusal to invest seriously in state-building outside
Kabul: all this [points not toward the skill and determination of
imperial rule but toward the compromised character of
hegemony]{.underline}---and also toward the amateurism of the American
effort. Nor did our effort produce a particularly honorable version of
hegemonic rule: it was hegemony without responsibility, which quickly
came to mean no hegemony at all. [Anyone who thought of the American
engagement in Afghanistan as an imperialist war must have been surprised
at its outcome. The United States lost men and material and gained none
of the usual prizes of imperial rule.]{.underline} Nor is it clear that
there was ever much to gain once the Cold War engagement with the Soviet
Union was over. After 9/11, there were defensive reasons for the war,
but imperialist reasons are very hard to find. Ellen Willis argues
strongly that the United States could have done good things in
Afghanistan after the invasion---and I would add that there was also a
debt to pay to the Afghans, given our role in bringing the Taliban to
power. Here is Willis's argument: My frustration . . . is not that we
took action in Afghanistan but that we have not done enough. We should
have fought the ground war and occupied Kabul; organized an
international force to disarm the warlords, protect ordinary citizens,
and oversee the distribution of aid; demanded that secularists be
included in the negotiations for a new government and that basic women's
rights be built into a new structure of law. If this is
"imperialism"---in the promiscuous contemporary usage of that term---I
am for it. I believe it is the prerequisite of a stable peace.7 I don't
think Willis is actually advocating an imperialist program here;
organizing her international force would have required a diplomacy of
concession and compromise, and the gains she was looking for were
definitely not material. This is a version of hegemony that the American
left could support and should have supported. The actual conduct of the
war and the under-resourced state-building that accompanied it required
leftist criticism, but [calling]{.underline} either of [these
imperialist didn't help anyone understand what was wrong with what we
were doing.]{.underline} The second reason for the likely futility of an
American imperialism is that our public commitment to democracy makes
imperial rule very hard to justify or manage. Even when that commitment
is obviously hypocritical (for many years we supported non-democratic
governments in countries like South Korea and Turkey), we do tend over
time to encourage or enable or at least bear with democratic
transformations. At the height of the Cold War, indeed, we refused to
bear with democratically elected governments in Iran, Guatemala, and
Chile. And possibly we will refuse in the future, in countries like
Egypt, say, where radical Islamists rather than communists threaten to
win elections. But it isn't easy for us to support dictators, even if
they are "our" dictators; it produces a kind of legitimacy crisis for
American power---another feature of hegemonic but not imperial rule. The
third reason for imperial futility is that [under contemporary
conditions, governments arise that are capable of opposing the
imperialist policies of any aspiring great power.]{.underline} And then
the aspiring power will, if it is wise, negotiate and compromise. [In
the world today]{.underline}, any refusal to do that, [any full-scale
imperialist project, would encounter such strong opposition from both
large and small states, and so strong a sense among people everywhere
that opposition was legitimate, that the project would be certain to
fail.]{.underline} When Rudyard Kipling called empire the "White Man's
burden," he was stating, in the ideological idiom of his time, a simple
fact: power brings responsibility. But [the burdens of hegemony can't be
borne alone; they have to be shared. A rationally governed hegemonic
power doesn't act unilaterally to regulate trade, deal with rogue (or
unfriendly) states, repel aggression, stop massacres, or take on the
very difficult work of state-building; it seeks allies, it marshals
coalitions.]{.underline} These will be coalitions of the willing,
obviously, but the [willingness has to be won by consultation,
persuasion, and compromise.]{.underline} In the early 2000s, the US
government sought to avoid any serious version of these necessary
processes, as if its leaders wanted to manage the world all by
themselves. That ambition is probably a better explanation of the Iraq
war than any provided by the theory of imperialism. But [America's
leaders can't manage the world even when they are ready for
consultation, persuasion, and compromise]{.underline}---as President
Obama discovered. At the end of the Obama years, many of his critics
asserted that the United States was no longer hegemonic. We had walked
away from our responsibilities in, for example, the Middle East. That
was a right-wing critique, but the thought that it might be true should
have delighted many leftists. In fact, hegemony is still a useful
description of America's place in the world.

### AT NATO Bad

#### Blanket critique of NATO erases the perspectives of East European left activists -- questions about our alliance commitments have to be decided on a case-by-case basis

**Walzer 18** \[Michael, Prof Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
*A Foreign Policy for the Left*, epub\]

Consider [the key question about the]{.underline} international
[political and military alliances of our country: Which odd bedfellows
are too]{.underline} odd or too [awful to take to bed? There is no
general answer; we have to look at each case, always asking which
alliances provide the greatest benefits to the people in greatest need.
In answering that question, we see American bedfellows that definitely
don't meet the necessary standard]{.underline} (and some, given the
alternatives, that do). [The NATO alliance is worth thinking about in
this regard. Originally organized to oppose]{.underline} Soviet
[communism, it was condemned by leftists]{.underline} still struggling,
against all the evidence, to defend that murderous regime. [After the
fall of communism, the NATO powers began a serious debate about
extending the alliance into eastern Europe. Many leftists]{.underline},
along with right-wing "realists," [opposed the extension;
some]{.underline} of them, like Jeremy Corbyn, a future leader of the
British Labour Party, [called for their countries'
withdrawal]{.underline} from NATO. [It may have been right to oppose the
extension or at least set limits to it; it was certainly right to oppose
withdrawal. But **what was entirely missing from the left side of the
debate**]{.underline}, most clearly in the politics of people like
Corbyn, **[was any commitment to talk to east European
leftists]{.underline}**--- Poles and Ukrainians, for example---**[and to
consider the views or even the safety and welfare of the people with the
most at stake.]{.underline}** Surely **[left internationalists have to
engage with our allies abroad before deciding whether to support or
oppose our country's alliances.]{.underline}**

### Antimilitarism Bad

#### Leftist foreign policy requires planning for when and how the state can act to promote progressive values -- blanket anti-interventionism is indistinguishable from right-wing isolationism

**Walzer 18** \[Michael, Prof Emeritus at the Institute for Advanced
Study in Princeton, Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences,
*A Foreign Policy for the Left*, epub\]

The men and women of [[the left]{.mark}---socialists, social-democrats,
and left-leaning liberals, all of us]{.underline}---are most at home in
the homeland; our politics is focused on the character of domestic
society. Though we claim to be internationalists---and we are, some of
the time---we [have [never got]{.mark}ten [a good grip on foreign
policy]{.mark} or on security policy.]{.underline} This is, I want to
argue, a highly principled failure. We do best with global issues when
they are most like domestic issues, as when we oppose inequality,
sweated labor, and anti-union practices abroad or work across borders
against environmental degradation. [Our record is not so good when the
issue is the possible use of force. That is something most of us don't
want to think about---or we just want to say no.]{.underline} Bernie
Sanders's Democratic primary campaign of 2016 provides a near-perfect
illustration of this position, though not the only one. Like it or not,
however, [we live together]{.underline} with our fellow citizens [in an
anarchic society of states where]{.underline} the ability to make wise
decisions about [the use of force is essential to the safety of our own
state, of states with which we have close relations, and sometimes of
people far away who are in desperate trouble and need our
help.]{.underline} Wise decision-makers opt for peace whenever they can,
but sometimes for a cold war, sometimes for the use of force short of
war, sometimes for the threat of war, and sometimes for the agony of war
itself. [Political wisdom isn't essentially militarist or
pacifist]{.underline} (or anything in between). [It requires a steady
commitment to conciliation and compromise]{.underline} so long as these
are possible, [and a readiness to fight when fighting is
necessary.]{.underline} The two are equally required. That combination
has always been a problem for the left. There are leftists, to be sure,
who are eager to support revolutionary wars, usually in distant places,
and to endorse the violent acts, sometimes even the terrorism, of
liberation movements. We are more hesitant when it comes to our own
countries' wars, especially if we live in a great power like the United
States. Then [[our standard argument is]{.underline}]{.mark} critical:
[[anti-imperialist and anti-militarist.]{.underline}]{.mark} Over many
years and many occasions, [this negative argument is certain to be right
some of the time. But when reiterated pretty much all the time, it
amounts to a questionable demand for inwardness.]{.underline} Arguing
against this imperial aggression or that military adventure, [[we
regularly insist that our country should avoid all engagements
abroad]{.mark} and devote its energy and resources to creating a more
just society here at home. Leftist conceptions of foreign policy,
insofar as we think about foreign policy, lean toward the avoidance of
forceful action.]{.underline} A commitment to neutrality in all
international conflicts and civil wars is one example of this (think of
social-democratic Sweden). Neutrality is a nice way of having and not
having a foreign policy at the same time. But there are moments when it
represents a critical and positive decision---as in 1917, when American
socialists argued against joining the European war. The common man, John
Reed claimed at the time, probably wrongly, "has a natural inclination
to neutrality."1 Strong support for the United Nations and the
International Criminal Court (ICC) is another example of leftist foreign
policy. I remember how, after the 9/11 attacks, many American leftists
wanted to turn to these institutions rather than act unilaterally or
with close allies against Al Qaeda, even though we knew the United
Nations and the ICC would not act at all. Perhaps that was the point. A
third, more curious but no less common example of leftism abroad is the
claim that everything that goes wrong in the world is America's
fault---and so we (Americans) should refrain from doing anything at all.
The denial of agency to other countries suggests a fairly radical
version of leftist inwardness; the lack of interest in what would happen
if the United States actually disengaged suggests an even more radical
version. I will take up leftist arguments about revolutionary wars and
liberationist violence, about the possibilities of global government,
and about domestic (and foreign) anti-Americanism in the chapters that
follow. Here I want to insist that [[the default position of the
left]{.underline}]{.mark}, the position we keep coming back to, [[is an
almost exclusive focus on]{.mark} how we and our fellow citizens live
when we are among ourselves. For many of us, the only good foreign
policy is a good domestic policy.]{.underline} Americans will be more
safe in the world and [the world will be better off, leftists have
repeatedly argued, if we concentrate on [creating a just society at
home.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is a very old position. It was first
voiced by the Hebrew prophets who claimed that if the ancient Israelites
honored the one true God by acting justly toward the men and women
created in his image, if they stopped grinding the faces of the poor, he
would protect them against Assyrian and Babylonian conquerors. They
would live at peace in their land forever, and be a "light unto the
nations" (Isaiah 42). All they had to do was sit still and shine. Thus
saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel. . . . If ye thoroughly amend
your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a
man and his neighbors; if ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless,
and the widow, and shed not innocent blood . . . then will I cause you
to dwell in this place . . . for ever and ever. (Jeremiah 7:3--7) Act
justly at home and your home will be secure---so says Jeremiah, and
Isaiah says that people around the world will admire your light and
imitate your justice. In the history of the modern left, it is easy to
find activists and militants playing variations on these themes. I will
offer just a few examples here; more will come in later chapters.
Consider Randolph Bourne's fierce critique of pro-war intellectuals in
1917. Bourne was "one of the strong and triumphant personalities" of
Greenwich Village's "lyrical left" and also the most brilliant opponent
of American engagement in the European war.2 This is what he said about
John Dewey, Walter Lippman, and other New Republic writers who supported
the war: "Never having felt responsibility for labor wars and oppressed
masses and excluded races at home, they had a large fund of idle
emotional capital to invest in the oppressed nationalities and ravaged
villages of Europe." This investment, Bourne insisted, was a mistake. So
long as "the promise of American life is not yet achieved . . . there is
nothing for us but stern and intensive cultivation of our garden."3 He
was probably right in his opposition to American engagement in the
European war---though his reasons, I think, were not right. [[It is an
odd]{.mark} leftist p[osition that makes responsibility at home exclude
responsibility abroad]{.mark}.]{.underline} This argument has echoed
over the years. Writing in the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq invasion,
Andrew Bacevich, one of its leading opponents, quoted Bourne's line
about "our garden" and argued that "if we live up to our professed
ideals . . . we may yet become, in some small way, a model worthy of
emulation"---which is to say, a light unto the nations.4 I believe
Bacevich was right about Iraq, but is a bad war sufficient reason for
Americans to cultivate their garden---and do nothing more? In addition
to Bourne, Bacevich also remembered and celebrated Charles Beard, the
radical historian who was, in the lead-up to World War II, one of this
country's most prominent isolationists. Writing in 1940, Beard defended
"continental Americanism" and argued that America must concentrate its
energy and intelligence on "overcoming the grave economic and social
crisis at home."5 [[The default position of the left
overlaps]{.underline}]{.mark} sometimes, as it did in 1940, [[with
right-wing isolationism]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it is usually very
different. [Leftists, most of us, are internationalists in spirit even
when we fail to be internationalist in policy. We know that we have
comrades in foreign countries with whom we should stand in solidarity.
[Too often]{.mark}, however, [we simply stand
still]{.mark}]{.underline}; it is hard to figure out, or we don't try to
figure out, what to do to help our comrades. But sometimes the spirit
moves us in stronger ways---as when leftists from around the world
rushed off to Spain to join the struggle against Franco and the
fascists. That was a moment when the left actually had a foreign policy
of its own---fight the fascists! The fight was organized and then
betrayed by the Comintern, whose leaders were more eager to attack
anarchists and Trotskyists than fascist soldiers. Still, this was a
brief internationalist moment, when idealistic young leftists fought
militarily in Spain while their friends fought politically in Britain,
France, and the United States to end the embargo on arms for the Spanish
Republic. How could democratic states be neutral, they asked, in a civil
war between republicans and fascists? But only a few years later, after
the Hitler-Stalin Pact, many leftists here at home were urging American
neutrality in the war between Nazi Germany and democratic Britain. In an
editorial published in April 1940, the now anti-war New Republic
provided a perfect example of the default position: "It is not a mark of
barren isolationism to believe with all one's heart that the best
contribution Americans can make to the future of humanity is to fulfill
democracy in the United States."6 At that moment, the New Republic stood
shoulder to shoulder with isolationist Charles Lindbergh and the America
First movement. The default position is sometimes said to follow from
the uncertainties and ambiguities of international politics. Thus Jeff
Faux in a debate (with me) about foreign policy: "Because the world is
so complicated, the imperial reach so wide, and our access to
information and our ability to process it so limited, the minimalist
default position still makes the most moral and political sense."7 Well,
yes, it probably is a good idea, when you don't know what to do, not to
do anything. In the years after 2011, President Obama was accused by
neo-conservative interventionists of dithering over what to do in Syria.
Given the complexities of the Syrian civil wars, dithering probably made
sense. But [a large portion of the American left]{.underline} wasn't
dithering at all; it [simply [oppose]{.mark}d any American action
abroad, [any exercise of American power.]{.mark} Leftists produced a
long list of the disasters likely to follow from a large-scale US
intervention---and then were hardly interested in the disasters that did
follow when a very limited (and ineffective) American intervention was
overwhelmed by the massive interventions of other states.]{.underline}
Complexity wasn't the issue here, but rather a principled refusal to
support an activist American policy in the Middle East, or anywhere
else. Surprisingly, perhaps, most US leftists felt little need to stand
in solidarity with the Syrian rebels, even those who called themselves
secular democrats. Judging by our behavior, we were also only weakly
committed to relief for the victims of the war---and not committed at
all if relief required the use of force (as the establishment of a safe
zone in northern Syria would have done). But later on, all of us
supported the reception of Syrian refugees in the United States, and we
were ready to take in far more than our government proposed. We argued
forcefully against right-wing xenophobia. Once the refugees were here or
on their way, solidarity was easier, for the issue now was the character
of our own society. As leftists, we were proud to defend ethnic and
religious diversity and to reject any curtailment of the rights of new
Americans. And we were eager to argue that America, as an immigrant
society, could be a light to other nations that had no history of
immigration. We fell naturally into the default position. No doubt, this
narrow domestic focus makes a lot of sense. Randolph Bourne was right to
say that oppressed workers and excluded races in the United States are
our first responsibility. And we have a long way to go in the project
that Richard Rorty called "achieving our country"---creating a fully
inclusive and just society.8 Though we haven't had many successes in
recent years, this is where our voices are strongest and clearest. We
stand in opposition to union-busting, racism, misogyny, xenophobia,
growing income inequality, the role of money in elections and the
advance of plutocracy, the pollution of the environment, homophobia, the
attack on the welfare state, and all attempts to undermine the right to
vote---I've put the list in random order because every group of leftists
has its own priorities. But we all know the reach of leftist commitment,
and we (mostly) support each other . . . when we are at home. But that
can't be the whole story of the left. So long as we are
internationalists in spirit, we can't escape what Václav Havel, speaking
to the Czech parliament in 1993, called "our co-responsibility for the
cause of freedom and democracy."9 [[In a world beset by wars and civil
wars, religious zealotry]{.mark}, terrorist attacks, [far right
nationalism, tyrannical governments, gross inequalities, and widespread
poverty and hunger, that cause requires intelligent leftist
attention]{.mark}.]{.underline} Our deepest commitment is solidarity
with people in trouble, and some of the worst troubles are being
experienced, right now, in the world abroad. So [we are going to be
engaged again and again in arguments about how we can help people in
faraway countries escape poverty and terror and how we can support those
among them who are working for freedom and democracy. [We will]{.mark}
also [have to argue about who]{.mark}, exactly, [should provide]{.mark}
that [support, and when]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is a book about those
arguments. It is an effort to answer the question What should the left's
foreign policy look like? In the chapters that follow I have tried to
join all the recent arguments about leftist engagements abroad. [I want
[to address not only the state policies we]{.mark} should support or
[oppose but also the policies we should adopt]{.mark}, the actions we
should pursue, on our own.]{.underline} We almost always think of
foreign policy as state policy, and we certainly ought to take an
interest in what our own state is doing in other people's countries
(even if we think it shouldn't be doing anything). But the left needs
its own foreign policy; we need to think about how our parties, unions,
and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) should act in the world. [And
since speech is action and words are weapons, we also need to think
about what we ourselves say about international politics.]{.underline}
We should write and argue in support of our friends and comrades in
other countries and in opposition to the enemies of democracy and
equality, wherever they are.

#### Anti-militarism ignores the necessity of state violence for leftist politics. There are no ideological shortcuts. What should be done has to be decided based on the specific and empirical situation.

*A Foreign Policy for the Left*, epub\]

The defense of the use of force by revolutionaries abroad goes along
with opposition to the use of force by one's own country. A [wholesale
rejection of militarism]{.underline} (and a reflexive refusal to vote
for the military budget) [is the most common left position. The pacifist
left harbors a deep suspicion of every form of state
violence]{.underline}, and almost all leftists are eager to support the
peacemakers whenever peace is a real possibility (and sometimes when it
isn't). Hence one standard argument, which is another version of the
default position: only militarists and imperialists go to war in other
people's countries. Leftist men and women understand that it is better
to keep the "boys" (as all soldiers once were) at home. And if you can't
keep them at home, then, as the Vietnam-era song has it: "Bring 'em back
alive."16 William Appleman Williams, the Wisconsin historian who greatly
influenced New Left attitudes toward foreign policy, argued that "the
truly essential need is to re-examine our conception of saving other
people and societies." The New Left, he wrote, should pursue a vision
"based on self-containment and community."17 Saving other people too
often requires sending the boys abroad or, in more contemporary terms,
putting boots on the ground. In a great power like Great Britain in the
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries or the United States from
the time of the war with Spain, anti-militarist politics is also
anti-imperialist politics. The two go together since empires cannot be
sustained without armies. This leftist blend of oppositions has produced
some fine moments. One of my favorites is the appearance in 1898 of the
Anti-Imperialist League, which campaigned against the American war in
the Philippines (and also opposed US policies in Cuba and Puerto Rico).
The league's members included Jane Addams, Ambrose Bierce, John Dewey,
Samuel Gompers, Henry and William James, Carl Schurz, and Mark Twain,
all of them arguing that democracy at home could not endure alongside
empire abroad.18 This might be another example of the default position,
except that the American anti-imperialists were not interested only in
democracy at home; many were also strong supporters of the Philippine
insurgents. Twain and a number of others had initially supported the war
against Spain---not an anti-militarist position---thinking it was a war
of liberation, a revolutionary war. They turned against it only when
they recognized the imperialist program of the American government. Now
it was the Philippine insurgents who were fighting a war of liberation.
Mark Twain's pamphlet To the Person Sitting in Darkness, published in
1901 by the Anti-Imperialist League of New York, is a classic left text
that ought to be reprinted every time anyone in the United States, or
anywhere else, tries by force to bring the light of civilization, or
democracy, or socialism to those who sit in darkness. Twain was more
than willing to bring, not light, but liberty. The Philippine temptation
was too strong, he wrote, and President McKinley had made a bad mistake:
he played "the European game." \[But\] this was the very time and place
to play the American game. . . . Rich winnings were to be gathered in,
too, rich and permanent, indestructible; a fortune transmissible forever
to the children of the flag. Not land, not money, not dominion---no,
something worth many times more than that dross . . . the spectacle of a
nation of long harassed and persecuted slaves set free through our
influence. Let the Philippine people deal with their domestic questions
in their own way, Twain wrote. "I am opposed to having the eagle put its
talons on any other land." As the war dragged on and its cruelties
multiplied, he wrote even more strongly. Here he is in 1906, after the
Moro massacre: General Wood was present and looking on. His order had
been, "Kill or capture those savages." Apparently our little army
considered that the "or" left them authorized to kill or capture
according to taste, and that their taste had remained what it had been
for eight years in our army out there---the taste of Christian
butchers.19 Anti-imperialism also produced the campaign of British
radicals against the Boer War, which approximately coincided with the
American war in the Philippines. Mark Twain thought these wars were
similar and required similar opposition. Indeed, we can find many
parallel arguments by British and American anti-imperialists, but there
was one significant difference. The British left in 1899 was viciously
anti-Semitic, in the style that the German socialist August Bebel called
"the socialism of fools." Leftists from the Social-Democratic Federation
and the Independent Labour Party claimed that the war was the work of
Jewish capitalists. "The Stock Exchange pulls the string and the British
government dances," wrote the editor of a left newspaper. "But behind
the Stock Exchange is the sinister figure of the financial Jew who is
gradually enmeshing the world in the toils of the money-web which . . .
the great racial free-masonry is spinning in every corner of the
globe."20 There were Jewish capitalists in America by the turn of the
twentieth century, but they do not seem to have been blamed for
America's imperial war. The Anti-Imperialist League is an example of
principled leftist engagement with the outside world. The same can be
said for much of the left's opposition to US imperialism in Central and
South America in the years since the Spanish-American War. US
governments have strengthened the hands of local dictators who make
deals with American businesses, and they have intervened, in both
clandestine and overt ways, in countries where leftists have won
elections or seemed about to win them. American support for the Pinochet
putsch in Chile is the classic example, but far from the only one. The
praiseworthy record of left opposition to all this makes it especially
strange that many leftists, after arguing against every US claim to a
sphere of influence in the Americas, hurried to defend Russian President
Putin's claim to a similar sphere in eastern Europe. Surely left
internationalists who favor self-determination for the people of Chile,
Guatemala, and El Salvador should extend the favor to the people of
Poland, Lithuania, and Ukraine. I will come back to this issue in
chapter 4. The American left's opposition to our entry into World War I
is another exemplary moment, though in this case the left's weakness may
have been the major reason for its excellence. While the large socialist
and social-democratic parties in Europe, driven by the patriotism of
their base, supported the war, the American party, with a much smaller
(and partly new-immigrant) base, held firm to its anti-war position.
What was going on in Europe, it maintained, was a struggle between
imperial powers, unjust on both sides; the United States should stay
out.21 Bourne's "cultivate our garden" was the line also of many
socialists. In a 1916 debate on the question "Must we arm?," Morris
Hillquit concluded for the negative: "Let us center our ambition, our
hope and aspiration on making our country the first great peace power in
the world."22 But American socialists were also internationalists who
believed in promoting class solidarity across borders and hoped for
revolutions abroad. I don't think they would have favored forceful
assistance to those revolutions; they were all anti-militarists,
opposed, like Hillquit, to preparing for war as well as to fighting it,
but they would have favored political, diplomatic, and (if it were
called for) economic support. So they supported the Russian revolution
in 1917, but when the Bolsheviks established their dictatorship, many
(not all) American socialists decided that internationalismn required
political critique. The early New Left opposition to the Vietnam War
resembles the old left's opposition in 1917, but what followed all too
quickly---enthusiastic endorsement of Vietcong politics---was neither
principled nor useful. It is worth remembering that Students for a
Democratic Society, which in 1965 organized the first major anti-war
demonstration in Washington, DC, "insisted that there be no expressions
of sympathy for the Viet Cong."23 That was the right position, though it
wasn't held for long. The revolutionary war was destined to end in
dictatorship, the murder of thousands, the flight of the "boat people,"
and large-scale "re-education." By the 1960s and '70s, none of this
could possibly have come as a surprise. What those years required was a
hard, even paradoxical politics: opposing the American war and also its
likely Vietnamese winner. Most leftists didn't like the paradox. There
were good reasons simply to oppose the war---much like the reasons for
opposition in the Philippines and World War I. All of these wars,
government officials told the world, were waged to save other people or
bring them democracy (at great cost to their countries), and in every
case the wars' opponents were right to refuse the mission. But
[anti-militarism also produced one of the worst moments in left
history---the opposition of many]{.underline}, though not all, British,
French, and American [leftists to rearmament against Nazi
Germany]{.underline} in the 1930s. The argument for [appeasement was
mostly a right-wing argument, but many people on the left supported it
because they were (or thought they were) anti-every-war.]{.underline}
Clement Atlee, the leader of Britain's Labour Party, criticized the
Munich Agreement in parliamentary debates; allowing Germany to annex
parts of Czechoslovakia was, he rightly said, the betrayal of "a
gallant, civilised, and democratic people." But since Atlee's party had
opposed rearmament throughout the 1930s, he could not argue in 1938 for
a war on behalf of the Czechs: Britain was grossly unprepared. On the
Labour Party left, Sir Stafford Cripps opted for the pure default
position, preferring a war against the British ruling class to a war
against Nazi Germany. He thought the best defense against the Nazis was
a socialist revolution at home. A minority of Labourites were committed
pacifists, but most would have supported a war of national defense, as
they later did. But they refused on principle to anticipate such a war
or to prepare for it.24 Harold Laski, the Labour Party's leading
intellectual, is an interesting exception. He was praised by the
American leftist Max Lerner in 1940 as someone who "has had to do his
thinking, as also his fighting, on two fronts---facing the enemy of
fascism abroad and the enemy of capitalist privilege at home. It is a
measure of his humanity that he knows which is the greater enemy."25
Unfortunately, neither Laski nor Lerner fully grasped the need for
another two-front war---against both capitalist privilege and Stalinism.
Left internationalists frequently have to fight on two fronts---and
sometimes a couple more (see chapter 8). Norman Thomas and Bertram
Wolfe's 1939 book, Keep America Out of War, which called for a
"reduction of the size of the military-naval budget," is a good example
of the American left's position in the lead-up to World War II.26 Of
course, the American Communist Party favored whatever policy Stalin
thought necessary to Soviet security. American communists were
anti-fascist and in favor of rearmament in the 1930s until the
Hitler-Stalin Pact brought a quick turn toward neutrality, America
First, and the default position, which was followed immediately after
the invasion of the Soviet Union in July 1941 by a fierce commitment to
a war against Germany. Socialists like Thomas, however, were
self-directed, and they chose pretty consistently to fight against the
last war. "We were," Irving Howe wrote years later, "a war behind in our
thinking."27 Thomas repeated the arguments of Eugene Debs without
noticing that Hitler's Germany was nothing like the kaiser's. How could
anyone fail to notice? [The oppositional politics that leftists were
most accustomed to, aimed always at American militarism]{.underline}
(the country was in fact drastically disarmed in the 1930s), [blinded
many of them to the reality of Nazi militarism. Nor were they ready to
acknowledge that fighting against militarism requires a military to do
the fighting.]{.underline} Perhaps [this is another example of the
default position: only an America without an army could be a light unto
the nations.]{.underline} Leftist readiness to support disarmament and
appeasement has another explanation: what I call the "politics of
pretending"---which in 1938 and '39 took the form of insisting on the
reasonableness of people who gave no sign of being reasonable. Paul
Berman nicely describes the large numbers of French socialists who
supported the Munich Agreement: "They gazed across the Rhine and simply
refused to believe that millions of upstanding Germans had enlisted in a
political movement whose animating principles were paranoid conspiracy
theories \[and\] blood-curdling hatreds."28 In the same spirit, later
on, many leftists were eager to describe the Chinese communists as
"agrarian reformers." More recently, many were quick to imagine Islamist
zealotry as a (strange) form of resistance to Western imperialism. I am
fairly sure that in each case, most of the people making these arguments
knew, deep down, that they were pretending. Opposition to the use of
force is only a common left position, not a consistent one. Think of the
International Brigades in the Spanish Civil War. Many leftists were
ready to fight against fascism until the Hitler-Stalin Pact forced a
large number of them into militant unreadiness. Soon enough, however,
leftists recognized a more urgent and forceful militancy. World War II
in western Europe was, in its leadership, a right-wing war, run by
nationalists (and imperialists) like Winston Churchill and Charles de
Gaulle, who had steadily opposed appeasement. Communists and popular
front leftists were a major force in underground opposition to the
Nazis, though (with a few exceptions) only after Germany invaded Russia.
The default position had temporarily lost its appeal. World War II
brought one critical issue to the fore: many leftists, especially those
influenced by Marxist doctrine, thought that once military force was
justified, there were no moral ("bourgeois liberal") constraints on its
use. But anarchists and pacifists, like Dwight Macdonald in his
marvelous magazine, Politics, sharply criticized the bombing of German
cities and the use of the atomic bomb against Japan.29 Macdonald and his
friends had opposed American participation in the war from the
beginning, and they maintained their opposition even after they
recognized that Nazism was not just one more imperialism. They got the
war wrong, but they were right to condemn many incidents in the war's
conduct. On the other hand, those of us leftists who got the war right
had little to say about attacks on enemy nations' civilian populations.
Moral arguments would figure in an important way in leftist opposition
to the Vietnam War, but they were rarely heard during the "good" war
against Nazism and Japanese militarism---which invites a question: Are
these arguments relevant to warfare generally, or are they merely useful
in our anti-war campaigns? Macdonald applied morality consistently in
World War II and afterward, but many leftists did not. Leftists have
supported the use of force---even by capitalist countries like the
United States---in other instances. Some Marxist militants argue that
any war fought by a capitalist country is, by definition, an imperialist
war. But the war in Korea, which was fought by an alliance of capitalist
countries, was supported by most people on the American and European
near-left. A war against aggression, approved by the United Nations,
could plausibly be called a just war. Nonetheless, there was left
opposition: Michael Harrington, the future leader of Democratic
Socialists of America, acting then as a member of the Catholic Worker
movement, and David Dellinger, with the War Resisters League, marched
against the war; I. F. Stone, bravely and (I think) wrongly, called it
unjust.30 The future editors of Dissent magazine, breaking with many of
their fellow Trotskyists, supported the war, but critically, which was
the right way to do it. The US attack on Afghanistan in 2001 was another
just war that nonetheless required sharp criticism. It was necessary
then and in the years that followed to distinguish between the decision
to fight and the conduct of the fighting. Ellen Willis did exactly that
when she wrote in April 2002 that her objections were "from the
beginning . . . not to the fact of our war in Afghanistan but to the way
we've conducted it."31 Since the Afghan war is commonly cited in leftist
argument as a key instance of imperial aggression, I will take it up,
and come back to Willis's commendable critique, in chapter 4. In a
history of the American left, Michael Kazin writes that ever since
Woodrow Wilson's administration, "liberals had ardently promoted wars to
preserve and advance democracy. The conflict over Vietnam put an end to
that tradition for decades to come."32 But by the 1990s, a more
minimalist liberal and left defense of war had emerged---heralded by The
Black Book on Bosnia, produced by the editors of the New Republic in
1996 and given full intellectual legitimacy by Samantha Power's A
Problem from Hell in 2002.33 [The aim of humanitarian intervention was
not to promote democracy but to stop mass murder, rape, and ethnic
cleansing.]{.underline} [NATO's Kosovo war]{.underline} of
1999---[driven]{.underline} in part [by the]{.underline} Srebenica
[massacre of Bosnian Muslims]{.underline} by Bosnian Serbs---[was a just
war]{.underline} and also a near-left war: the Labour Party was in power
in Britain, the Socialists in France, a coalition of Social Democrats
and Greens in Germany, and the Democratic Left in Italy. The Clinton
administration represented a weak version of this left politics, but it
provided the leadership essential to the war effort. [Military
intervention in Kosovo was opposed by people on the farther left, who
could not credit its humanitarian motive.]{.underline} I remember being
told by a "refoundation" communist at the Gramsci Institute in Turin,
Italy, in March 1999 that NATO "must be" aiming to seize control of the
Black Sea from the Russians. There was no other explanation for the
"imperialist" war. Actually, there were other explanations: [some
leftists thought the war was directed against]{.underline} Slobodan
[Milošević as the last standing Socialist, in an effort to complete the
destruction of "Actually Existing Socialism" in the former Soviet bloc.
Amazingly]{.underline} (since Serbia's "socialism" had little to do with
socialism), [a group of leftists formed the]{.underline} International
[Committee to Defend Slobodan Milosevic.]{.underline} Chaired by Michael
Parenti, the author of To Kill a Nation: The Attack on Yugoslavia
(2000), it included Harold Pinter and former US attorney general Ramsey
Clark. The more persuasive far-left critique came later: that left
interventionism in Kosovo made [the war in Iraq]{.underline} easier to
plan and defend. But that [can't be an argument against the use of force
for urgent humanitarian reasons. It is instead (and again) an argument
for making distinctions. The Iraq war was not a humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}; indeed, it left the defense of
humanitarianism in "tatters," as Michael Bérubé writes.34 According to
one of its justifications, the aim of the Iraq war was to overthrow a
brutal dictator and promote democracy. There were left arguments and
precedents for a war of that sort, but there was also a very strong left
argument against it---an argument made, perhaps for the first time, by
the US Socialist Party in 1917: "Democracy can never be imposed upon any
country by a foreign power by force of arms."35 The Labour Party's David
Miliband was right when he said in 2008 that during the previous decades
"the neo-conservative movement seemed more certain about spreading
democracy around the world" than the left did. The left, he argued, was
"conflicted between the desirability of the goal and its qualms about
the use of military means."36 The [qualms are reasonable when it comes
to democracy promotion, but not when it comes to stopping a
massacre.]{.underline} The campaign for intervention in Darfur, not the
invasion of Iraq, was the closest continuation of the near-left's Kosovo
war. I will come back to this issue in chapter 3. [Arguments about the
use of force for humanitarian or liberationist purposes are complicated;
they require close attention to local circumstance and particular
histories. We have to think hard about the relation of means to
ends.]{.underline} Doing it right will produce judgments that seem
radically inconsistent, though they are not: supporting Algerian
independence but rejecting FLN terrorism, for instance, or urging
American aid to revolutionary Cuba while condemning the growing
authoritarianism of the Cuban regime, or opposing the Vietnam War while
criticizing Vietcong politics. [Ideological shortcuts, created to make
the judgments easier, are popular among many leftists and require a left
critique.]{.underline} I will just list the shortcuts here; much of this
book will be devoted to criticizing them and arguing for a more
reflective engagement with world politics. The first shortcut is to
pretend that oppression turns men and women into angels and to support
the oppressed people of the world no matter what they do. But the
oppressed are still frail human beings, and one of the reasons we oppose
oppression is because of the pathologies it produces in (some of) its
victims and the vicious politics that it (sometimes) promotes. The
second shortcut, perhaps more popular than the first, is to stand up
always against "imperialism"---or, a shortcut inside the shortcut,
always to oppose American policies abroad. [Anti-Americanism is a common
left politics, which, again, sometimes gets things right and sometimes
doesn't.]{.underline} I believe that it got things right in Vietnam in
1967; it mostly got things right from the beginning to the end of the
twentieth century in Central and South America; it got Iran right in
1953, when leftists criticized the anti-Mossadegh coup, and it got Iraq
right in 2003. [But that's not enough to make the shortcut a reliable
one.]{.underline} The defeat of Nazism and Stalinism, the two most
brutal political regimes in world history, was in significant ways
American work. Many people on the left supported that work, as we should
have. In 1967, Dwight Macdonald wrote to Mary McCarthy that the American
war in Vietnam proved "that despite all the good things about our
internal political-social-cultural life, we have become an imperialist
power, and one that, partly because of these domestic virtues, is a most
inept one."37 We are still inept: in December 2005, with 100,000
American soldiers in Iraq, we organized an election there---and our man
came in third. This result may be without precedent in imperial history.
(It might suggest that we were less interested in imperial control than
in promoting democracy, though the Iraqi politician who came in first
wasn't much of a democrat.) Macdonald's understanding of US imperialism
reflects a political intelligence and a moral balance that are mostly
missing in contemporary anti-American writing. Another often used
shortcut is to oppose everything Israel does and to blame it for much
that it hasn't done, since it is the "lackey" of American imperialism
or, alternatively, the dominant force shaping American foreign policy.
The policies of recent Israeli governments require strong
criticism---the occupation, the settlements, the refusal to suppress
Jewish thugs and terrorists on the West Bank. But much of the left
attack on Israel has little to do with its policies and more to do with
its existence, which is taken to be the root cause of all evils in the
Middle East. This view violates all the requirements of realism---by
which I mean simply a readiness to see the world as it really is. The
last shortcut is to support every government that calls itself leftist
or anti-imperialist and sets itself against American interests. This is
different from the old Stalinist shortcut: support the Soviet Union,
whatever it does, because it is the first proletarian dictatorship and
the first workers' paradise. That kind of politics is, I think,
definitively finished, though it had a brief afterlife focused on China
and then, with very few believers, on Albania and North Korea. The more
recent version celebrates Maximal Leaders like Gamal Nasser, Fidel
Castro, or Hugo Chávez; there are also short-lived infatuations, such as
Michel Foucault's affair with the future Ayatollah Khomeini. Leftist
enthusiasm for populist dictatorships is one of our sad stories, which
ends when resources run out, the failure to build the economy suddenly
becomes undeniable, and the military takes over. But often the Maximal
Leader is a military man himself, and the repressive role of the army
simply becomes more obvious over time. In Latin America today, the
better left is represented by socialists and social-democrats in
countries like Chile, Brazil, and Costa Rica who reject demagogic
populism and struggle to produce economic growth, greater equality, and
a stronger welfare state---and who attract less enthusiasm from American
leftists than they deserve.38 There is a lot to be said for the default
position. We should work in the place we know best to make things
better. The improvement of humanity begins at home. This argument has
special force for Americans, who live in an increasingly unequal society
that is also a near-hegemonic world power. We need to be wary of
adventures abroad that make our work at home more difficult. Still,
[good leftists can't avoid internationalism. We will be engaged again
and again in arguments about what we should do or what we should urge
the United States to do to help people in trouble or comrades
abroad.]{.underline} Sometimes there is nothing that the United States
can do, at least nothing it is likely to do right. But even when we
oppose American action in other countries, we can be active
ourselves---providing moral, political, and financial support to men and
women fighting in self-defense or in defense of others. [There is no
magic answer to the question, What should we do?]{.underline} But the
[ideological shortcuts]{.underline} I've just described, lazily adopted
and rigidly held, [have served us badly in the past and are almost
certain to serve us badly in the future. Sticking with them means that
we will get things right only by accident.]{.underline} [Political
intelligence and moral sensitivity work much better than ideology, and
they are what should guide our]{.underline} choice of comrades and our
[decisions about when and how to act abroad.]{.underline} Dictators and
terrorists are never our comrades. We should embrace only those men and
women who really believe in and practice democracy and equality. We
should act abroad only with those who share our commitments and then,
only in ways consistent with those commitments. This is the politics
that I want to call left internationalism.

#### American military force key to prevent genocidal violence -- their reactionary "anti-Imperial" ethics sanction authoritarian intervention and condemn millions to death 

**Hamid '16** \[Shadi, senior fellow at the Project on U.S. Relations
with the Islamic World at the Brookings Institution, "Is a Better World
Possible Without U.S. Military Force?," The Atlantic, October 18, 2016,

The eight years of the Obama presidency have offered us a natural
experiment of sorts. Not all U.S. presidents are similar on foreign
policy, and not all (or any) U.S. presidents are quite like Barack
Obama. After two terms of George W. Bush's aggressive militarism, we
have had the opportunity to watch whether attitudes toward the
U.S.---and U.S. military force---would change, if circumstances changed.
President [Obama shared]{.underline} at least [some of the assumptions
of both the]{.underline} hard [Left and]{.underline} foreign-policy
[realists]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} the use of [direct U.S.
military force abroad]{.underline}, [even with the best of
intentions]{.underline}, [often does more harm then good]{.underline}.
Better, then, to "do no harm." [This has been]{.underline} Barack
[Obama's position on]{.underline} the [Syria]{.underline}n Civil War,
the key foreign-policy debate of our time. The president's discomfort
with military action against the Syrian regime seems deep and
instinctual and oblivious to changing facts on the ground.
[[When]{.mark} **the [debate over intervention began]{.mark}, around
[5,000 Syrians had been killed. Now it's close to
500,000.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Yet, Obama's basic orientation toward
the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has remained unchanged. This
suggests that [Obama]{.underline}, like many others who
[oppose]{.underline} U.S. [intervention]{.underline} against Assad, is
doing so [on]{.underline} "principled" or, to put it differently,
[ideological grounds. Despite]{.underline} President
[Obama's]{.underline} very conscious desire to limit [America's role in
the Middle East]{.underline} and to minimize the extent to which U.S.
military assets are deployed in the region, [there is little evidence
that]{.underline} the [views of th]{.underline}e hard [Left and other
critics]{.underline} of American power [have changed]{.underline} as a
result. (Yes, the U.S. military is arguably involved in more countries
now than when the Obama administration took office, but---compared to
Iraq and Afghanistan before him---Obama's footprint has been decidedly
limited, with a reliance on drone strikes and special-operations
forces.) As for those who actually live in the Middle East[, a less
militaristic America has done little to temper
anti-Americanism]{.underline}. In the three countries---Egypt, Jordan,
and Lebanon---for which Pew has survey data for both Bush's last year
and either 2014 or 2015, favorability toward the U.S. is significantly
worse under Obama today than it was in 2008. Why exactly is up for
debate, but **[we can at the very least say that [a drastic drawdown of
U.S. military personnel]{.mark}]{.underline}**---precisely the policy
pushed for by Democrats in the wake of Iraq's failure---[[**does not
seem to have bought America much goodwill.** Despite the fact that Assad
and Russia are responsible for indiscriminate attacks]{.mark} on
civilians]{.underline} and civilian infrastructure,
[including]{.underline} [hospitals]{.underline}, [[many]{.underline}
[leftists]{.underline} ]{.mark}[have viewed even the mere mention of the
U.S. doing anything in response as "warmongering."]{.underline} We have
had the unfortunate situation of someone as (formerly) well-respected as
Jeffrey Sachs arguing that the U.S. should provide "air cover and
logistical support" to Bashar al-Assad. We have had Wikileaks' attacks
on the White Helmets, who have risked---and, for at least 140,
lost---their lives in the worst conditions to save Syrian lives from the
rubble of Syrian and Russian bombardment. Of course, it is not an absurd
position to be skeptical of any proposed American escalation against
Assad, and many reasonable people across the political spectrum have
made that case. But **[it is something else]{.underline}** entirely
**[to [apply]{.mark} such [skepticism selectively to the U.S.]{.mark}
and not to others, [especially when]{.mark} the [others]{.mark} in
question [deliberately target civilians]{.mark} as a matter of
policy]{.underline}**. It can be a slippery slope. While no one would
accuse Obama of liking Putin, coordinating with and enabling Russia in
Syria is effectively U.S. policy. As the New York Times columnist Roger
Cohen noted in February, well before the current disaster in Aleppo:
"The troubling thing is that the Putin policy on Syria has become hard
to distinguish from the Obama policy." [The Left has always had a
utopian bent, believing that life]{.underline}, not just for Americans,
but for millions abroad, [can be made better through human
agency]{.underline} (rather than, say, simply hoping that the market
will self-correct). The problem, though, is that **[the better, more
just world]{.underline}** that **[so many hope for [is simply impossible
without the use of American military force]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [At
first blush, such a claim might seem self-evidently absurd. Haven't we
all seen what happened in Iraq?]{.underline} The 2003 Iraq invasion was
one of the worst strategic blunders in the history of U.S. foreign
policy. Yet, [it's not clear what exactly this has to do with the Syrian
conflict]{.underline}, [which is almost the inverse of the Iraq
war.]{.underline} In Iraq, civil war happened after the U.S. invasion.
In Syria, civil war broke out in the absence of U.S. intervention. What
all of this suggests is that **[attitudes toward the U.S.
military]{.underline}**, and by extension the United States, **[are
often "inelastic,"]{.underline}** meaning that what the U.S. actually
does or doesn't do abroad has limited bearing on perceptions of American
power. As a general proposition, [many]{.underline} leftists, for
example, [seem to believe that there is something intrinsically wrong
with the use of military force by the United States]{.underline}. **[In
other words, [when America does it, it is a bad thing, irrespective of
the outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}** it produces, and therefore should be
opposed outright. **[[There is rarely any real effort to explain
why]{.mark} it's bad]{.underline}**---[after all, if it were purely a
moral stand against the killing of innocents, the use of Russian or
Syrian military force would have to be considered much worse. **But,
[for]{.mark} the use of [American power]{.mark} abroad [to be
intrinsically wrong]{.mark} or immoral[, all]{.mark} uses of [military
force would have to be either immoral or
ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or both. However, as a factual
matter, [**[this is simply not the case.]{.underline}** [There was no
way to stop]{.underline}]{.mark} [mass slaughter and [genocide in Bosnia
or Kosovo without]{.mark} U.S. [military force]{.mark},]{.underline}
[buttressed, as it should be, by]{.underline} broad [regional or
international consensus]{.underline}. In those two cases, a U.S.-led
coalition acted. **[In]{.underline}** those **[cases [where the
international community did not act, genocide
did]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} in fact, [**[occur]{.underline}**,
**[as]{.underline}**]{.mark} we witnessed **[[in
Rwanda]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What became clear then---and what has
become clear once again in Syria---is that [a world where others than
the U.S. take the initiative to stop such slaughter does not exist, and
is unlikely to exist at any point in the foreseeable
future.]{.underline} While they may be less common, [there are also
cases where dictators will not only kill their own people but try to
forcefully invade and conquer their neighbors]{.underline}. As in the
first Gulf War, [the [gobbling up of Kuwait could not have been
prevented without a U.S.-led coalition]{.mark}]{.underline}, again with
broad international support. The list goes on. [From a moral standpoint,
no one should have to suffer under the indignities of ISIS rule. From a
strategic standpoint, having an extremist state the size of Indiana in
the middle of the Middle East]{.underline}, needless to say, [does not
suggest the coming of a better, more secure world]{.underline}. While
Obama was late to act against the organization and while the anti-ISIS
campaign has been deeply flawed, the amount of territory that ISIS
controls has been reduced significantly, due in large part to U.S.
airstrikes, intelligence, and special-operations forces. [[No
one,]{.mark} not Turkey, Saudi Arabia, or anyone else, [was going
to]{.mark} seriously [confront ISIS without U.S. coordination and
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}, and it's U.S. coordination and
leadership that is facilitating the current battle for the Islamic
State's Iraqi stronghold in Mosul. This is the faulty---and ultimately
quite dangerous---premise behind one of the founding assumptions of
Obama's foreign policy: that if the U.S. steps back, others will step
in. [Even when "others" do step in, the results are often destructive,
since America's allies and adversaries alike do not generally share its
values, interests, or objectives.]{.underline} Of course, U.S. military
force may be necessary, but it can never be sufficient on its own. This
is where the judgment, morality, and strategic vision of politicians and
policymakers can make the crucial difference. [The United States has not
been the "force for good" that many Americans would like to think it's
been. There is a tragic history of intervention abroad that more
Americans should be aware of]{.underline}, whether it's overthrowing
democratically elected leaders in Latin America or backing brutal
dictators in the Middle East. **[[There is no reason to think the U.S.
is]{.mark} necessarily [doomed to repeat]{.mark} those [mistakes
indefinitely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But **[[even if it was, there would
still be instances where only U.S. military force could be counted on to
stop genocide.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The alternative to a proactive and
internationalist U.S. policy is to "do no harm," and this might seem a
safe fallback position: Foreign countries and cultures are too
complicated to understand, so instead of trying to understand them,
let's at least not make the situation worse. [The idea that the U.S. can
"do no harm,"]{.underline} however, [depends on the fiction that the
most powerful nation in the world can ever be truly "neutral" in foreign
conflicts, not just when it acts, but also when it doesn't]{.underline}.
[**[Neutrality]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or silence, [**[is often
complicity]{.underline}**,]{.mark} something that was once the moral,
urgent claim of the Left. The fiction of neutrality is growing more
dangerous, [**as we enter a period of resurgent authoritarianism,
anti-refugee incitement, and routine mass killing.** This is the
built-in contradiction of what might be called the "anti-imperialist
Left." They are against empire, and there is only one country powerful
enough to reasonably be considered "imperial."]{.underline} (Russia, of
course, engages in bloody imperial ventures, but it gets a pass since it
is acting against the United States.) **[But [to insist that the
fundamental problem]{.mark} in today's world [is American imperialism is
to have]{.mark} only the most [outdated
"principles"---]{.mark}]{.underline}**principles [**[that]{.mark},** in
the case of Syria, Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, and even Libya, [**have
left**,]{.mark} or would have left, **[the]{.mark} most [vulnerable and
suffering without any recourse to safety and
protection]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} If the United States
announced tomorrow morning that it would no longer use its military for
anything but to defend the borders of the homeland, many would
instinctively cheer, perhaps not quite realizing what this would mean in
practice. But that is the conundrum the Left is now facing. **[A world
without mass slaughter]{.underline}**, of the sort of we are seeing
every day in Syria, **[cannot ever come to be without American
power]{.underline}**. But perhaps this will prove one of the positive
legacies of the Obama era: showing that the alternative of American
disinterest and disengagement is not necessarily better. [For
those]{.underline}, though, that care about ideology---[holding on to
the idea that U.S. military force is somehow inherently
bad]{.underline}---[more than they care about actual human outcomes, the
untenability of their position will persist]{.underline}. That, too,
will be a tragedy, since **[at a time when many on the Right are turning
jingoistic or isolationist, [there is a need for voices that]{.mark} not
just believe in U.S. power, but [believe]{.mark} that that
[power]{.mark}]{.underline}**---still, for now, preeminent---**[[can be
used for better, more moral ends.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### AT Liberal Warfare

#### "Liberal warfare" and imperialism impacts are so abstract they're useless - doesn't provide any accurate method to understand war

**Chandler 9** \[David, Professor of IR at University of Westminster,
\"Liberal War and Foucaultian Metaphysics\", Review of Dillon and Reid's
The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf\]

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars]{.mark} and conflicts [but to an abstract
model of conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**, defined as a desire to'remove
war from the life of humanity'which'derives from the way in which
liberalism takes the life of the species as its referent object of
politics ─ biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of
war very much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that [the distinctiveness of 'the liberal way of
war']{.mark} which they seek to explore [cannot be more than a fool's
quest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They assert that they will critically
uncover the paradox of liberal war: why it is that Realist or
geostrategic war accepts the necessity of war but attempts to limit it,
while liberals wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to fight
unlimited wars. Yet, they admit that **[[this starting point is]{.mark}
already [an ideological dead end]{.mark}]{.underline}** [─ the [wars of
the twentieth century give the lie to the]{.mark} idea that there is
some [distinction between 'unending crusades' and 'limited
jousts]{.mark} between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
[alleged]{.mark} to be fought differently to geo-political wars for
territory, because the '[drivers' of war are]{.mark} not territorialized
interests but the biopolitical [framings of the]{.mark} needs of the
[human]{.mark}, how human life can and should be lived.]{.underline}
[Inevitably [there are **insuperable methodological hurdles** to
this]{.mark} Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already, [there occurs the
first fundamental aporia: how do we tell the difference between a
liberal and non-liberal war?]{.underline} [[There appears to be no way
of preventing the category of liberal war from becoming a lifeless and
descriptive]{.mark} one: wars are liberal and fought biopolitically only
if we are told that these are the motives by those fighting
them]{.underline}.¶ **[This separation of liberal ways of war from
territorialised framings of geostrategic contestation makes little
sense]{.underline}** [as a framework for understanding]{.underline}
either liberal rule or liberal ways of [war]{.underline}. In fact, [in
defining liberal war in this way the connection between liberal rule and
war is entirely severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions
also be geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [It would appear that every form
of rule and of war has at least an implicit view of the 'human' and
through this view of the human the form of rule and the way of war are
rationalized. There is not and cannot be anything specifically 'liberal'
about this]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing, through war
on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's stoic
cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[[The]{.mark} key starting [assumption, that the
liberal way of war can be isolated]{.mark} from any other -
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** its alleged specific form, of ['**[unending
violence', explained by its referent]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[of the
human - [appears]{.mark} to be]{.underline}** a **[[particularly
unproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}** one. [At the level of abstraction at
which Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that
would help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

### AT Grove

**Grove's move is totalizing, preemptive, and cedes the present to
fascists**

**Tallis 20** \[Benjamin, Researcher at Institute of International
Relations Prague, "Un-cancelling the future," New Perspectives 1--18,
2020, https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2336825X20937580\]

**[Timeless pessimism, hopeless critique]{.underline}** Hope is a Form
of Extortion. (Jairus Grove, Savage Ecology, 2019: 25) Both Rutger
Bregman (2014) and Franco Berardi (2011) have written extensively on
this pessimism. In different ways and with different aims, they argue
that [**despite the** huge **and** real]{.underline} (**[although highly
uneven and inequitable]{.underline}**) **[progress that
we]{.underline}** (in this case, many of us who live in the West)
[**have made in helping more people live longer, healthier, happier
lives, we no longer believe we can** improve further]{.underline}.
[**[We have become]{.mark}** collectively
[disappointed]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**by the** failures **of**
political]{.underline}]{.mark} **[and]{.underline}**
[technological]{.underline} **[[vision]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
[**shocked by [the ]{.mark}**[downsides **of**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[modernity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**stunned by the** scale **and**
complexity **of our challenges**]{.underline} [**-- and by the** pace
**of** change**.**]{.underline} As Jonathan Meades (2014) observed,
**[change itself has changed: for many in the West, it used to mean
change for the better2]{.underline}** **[but for too many people that is
no longer the case.]{.underline}** This fear of change itself has
exacerbated the problem, leading to a stasis of ideas, a lack of daring,
deficit of vision and vacuum of purpose. [**Even faced with the
existential crisis of climate change, our responses have been**
piecemeal **and** incremental]{.underline}. Too often even the bolder
proposals have been mealy mouthed or, worse, have framed human life
itself as the problem (e.g. Sparrow, 2019; Wilkinson, 2020). A pious
puritan streak in the environmental movement seems to relish in the idea
of a future of less, a restricted and spartan life, purged of joy. It
has not been widely embraced. Both Bregman and Berardi note that
majorities or significant minorities of people in richer countries have
long believed their children will be worse off than they are (see, e.g.
Pew, 2019) -- but they don't wish to actively spur this process along.
**[There has been]{.underline}** **[no credible]{.underline}** [positive
vision]{.underline} **[of]{.underline}** [radical change]{.underline}
**[to]{.underline}** [countervail]{.underline} **[this]{.underline}**
[negativity]{.underline} [**and so we drift,** seemingly
helpless]{.underline} [**as well as** hopeless]{.underline} [**in the**
interregnum of ideas]{.underline}. As Bregman puts it: the real crisis
of our times, of my generation, is not that we don't have it good, or
even that we might be worse off later on. No, [**the real crisis is that
we can't** come up with anything better**.**]{.underline} (Bregman,
2014: 22) He goes on to note that [[**we have become so** wary
**of**]{.mark} **positive visions of [progress that]{.mark}: today we**
stamp out dreams of a better world before they can take
root]{.underline}. [[Dreams **have a way of turning into**
nightmares]{.underline},]{.mark} goes the cliche´. [Utopias]{.underline}
[**are a breeding ground for** discord]{.underline},
[violence]{.underline}, **[even]{.underline}** [genocide]{.underline}.
Utopias ultimately become dystopias; in fact, a utopia is a dystopia.
(Bregman, 2014: 23) **[Examples of this way of thinking are plentiful
but,]{.underline}** for convenience, [**[one need to look no further
than]{.mark}** Jairus [Grove's]{.mark}]{.underline} scintillatingly
pessimistic keynote at the Hamburg Sessions (forthcoming as an essay in
NP and based on his 2019 book, **[Savage Ecology]{.underline}**).3 [**It
is not that Grove doesn't make** compelling]{.underline} **[critical
arguments]{.underline}** -- he does and in brilliant, imaginative ways
-- **[but]{.underline}** that [**they** lack balance.]{.underline} And
balance matters, whether we are reckoning with horrendous pasts or
trying to boldly imaging new futures. [**To see, or certainly to** dwell
on]{.underline}, [only]{.underline} [**the** bad **in what we in the
West have collectively done**]{.underline} (however, Grove or anyone
else defines who we are), [**over the entire course of our past and
present is** grossly unfair]{.underline}. **[It also
amounts]{.underline}**, in effect, [**to a** [counsel of
despair]{.mark},]{.underline} [**however much [Grove]{.mark} protests to
the contrary or** claims to eschew nihilism]{.underline}. In his
keynote, [**having written off our past and present, Grove also
explicitly [urged us]{.mark} in Europe and the West** [to stop imagining
better, progressive futures]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[arguing that this
has led to precisely the problems he identified]{.underline}**.
[**Grove's [critique thus]{.mark} not only [leaves us ]{.mark}**[out of
time]{.mark}]{.underline} [([**without an** avowable
**past**]{.underline}]{.mark}[**, present or future) but also leaves
us** [without space]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**for** contesting
negative]{.mark}**,** regressive **and** repressive]{.underline}
**[[political trends]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In his book, he laments the
'debilitating stupor' in which the work of thinkers like Theodor Adorno
and Giorgio Agamben leaves us (Grove, 2019: 238). But [**Grove's own
pessimism, if we took it seriously, would leave Europeans** without a
political leg to stand on**. It would**]{.underline} **[leave
us]{.underline}** in just such a stupor -- or worse --
**[with]{.underline}** no solid ground and no lever: **[no way to move
the world and no platform for positive, progressive change. Why bother,
if everything we do only makes things worse? [However much harm]{.mark}
we]{.underline}** Europeans and [**[Westerners have done, we]{.mark}**
haven't **done,** don't **and [won't ]{.mark}**[only do
harm]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}** real
[**[danger]{.mark} of Grove's type [of ]{.mark}**[timelessly pessimistic
**and**]{.mark} literally [hopeless]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[critique is
that]{.mark} (]{.underline}**again, if **[taken
seriously]{.underline}**) [**[it breeds]{.mark} only** damaging
inertia]{.underline}, [[inaction]{.underline} **[and]{.underline}**
[resentment]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [**its** hopelessness **makes it a**
debilitating critique]{.underline}; **[its]{.underline}**
[timelessness]{.underline} [[**offers** no possibility of
salvage]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**let alone** progress]{.underline}[.
[**It** cedes the ground of action]{.underline}]{.mark} **[to
those]{.underline}** **[who many of us]{.underline}** (including Grove)
**[would]{.underline}** [explicitly disagree with]{.underline} --
[**whether to exponents of '**traditional' approaches]{.underline} [**to
IR who are more than happy to offer policy advice or, worse, [to
]{.mark}**[authoritarians **and** populists]{.mark}]{.underline} **[in
practical politics]{.underline}** (as ably described in Johanna
Sumuvuori's essay in this issue). **[Critical scholars]{.underline}**
too **[rarely see it as their task to construct positive visions of
better worlds]{.underline}**. **[Instead, too often they content
themselves]{.underline}** (if no one else) [**with**
evermore]{.underline} thoroughgoing [deconstructive
critique]{.underline} -- including of other critical academics. Whether
totalising or parasitic, even some of its leading proponents admit that
**[IR's critical project has]{.underline}**, thus far,
**[had]{.underline}** [insufficient impact]{.underline} **[on the world
at large]{.underline}** (Austin, 2017, 2019). Few critical scholars will
thank me for this comparison, but, in their pessimistic, misanthropic
zeal, they echo what French President Emmanuel Macron called the 'sad
passions' of the author Michel Houellebecq4 (Carre\`re, 2017). They may
not share Houellebecq's politics, but many critical scholars certainly
share his exhaustive (and exhausting) disenchantment with contemporary
(neo)liberal societies, the state of Europe and of the West. Too often
they also share his miserabilist outlook on the impossibility of change
for the better and the futility or harm of even trying to improve
things. [**Grove does propose several forms of political action:**
micro-kindnesses]{.underline}, **[however vague]{.underline}** (e.g.
'the impossible generosity and affirmation of deconstruction', 2019:
231); [resistant acts]{.underline} [**by** brave
individuals]{.underline} (**[e.g. 'William ''Fox'' Fallon, who
sacrificed his prestigious position as head of \[US Military\] Central
Command]{.underline}** because he would not go along with the plan to
attack Iran', 2019: 232); [**embracing entirely** new 'forms of
life5]{.underline} '[**; or** welcoming apocalypse as driver of
change]{.underline} (2019: 229--248). [**Grove** will not be confused
with Goldilocks **anytime soon -- these forms of action each seem
either** too little **or (**much**)** too much. **Few of us would
question the** value **of and** need **for** kindness]{.underline} and,
indeed, the most hopeful part of Grove's book is the touching
introduction where he details many of the kindnesses he has himself
benefitted from, mainly from people in the West where he has spent most
of his life. [**There is also, clearly, a role for resistance and for
the kinds of acts that Grove notes have prevented executions and even
nuclear war.** Yet]{.underline} [[**without a** wider
programme]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**without a** bigger positive
vision]{.underline}, [**kindness and [resistance ]{.mark}**[cannot
sufficiently change our world for the better]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**Apocalypse, on the contrary,** changes too much]{.underline},
[**junks** too much that is good **and is** rarely likely to be an
appealing option]{.underline}, **[or something we can all get behind.
The apocalyptic aspect of Grove's position]{.underline}**, like that of
many critical scholars, **[seeks to inflict destructive harm on Western
institutions rather than constructively reform them]{.underline}** --
something Houellebecq would also relish. Apocalyptic change also smacks
of the recklessly callous, negative sides of early 20th-century futurism
(Marinetti, 1909), as Grove acknowledges when asking 'How do we go wild
without the cruelty of indifference?' (2019: 280). Again, a more
balanced approach to boldness would help. **[To be clear, major change
is needed]{.underline}** -- that was the whole point of the Hamburg
Sessions and the motivation behind giving it the theme of 'Un-Cancelling
the Future'. I've argued elsewhere that **[the kind of
socio-economically regressive, technocratic, defensive liberalisms that
have dominated large parts of the last 40 years in the West have a lot
to answer fo]{.underline}**r (Tallis, 2018). So too, of course, does the
type of narrowly, teleological individually atomising (neo)liberalism
that neither saw (Fukuyama, 1992) nor allowed (Fisher, 2009) alternative
visions of politics, societies and economies. Mark Fisher (2009),
echoing the artist Gerhard Richter (Elger, 2009), called this myopic
liberalism 'Capitalist Realism'. You don't have to be a Marxist or even
a leftist to see that a mandated lack of alternatives and a commensurate
narrowing of possibilities and horizons is a bad thing. As noted above,
both climate change and sociotechnical upheavals in the ways we work and
live need bold visions to address the challenges they pose while also
seizing the opportunities they present. [**[It is,]{.mark} however,**
eminently [possible **to recognise the** full
horrors]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[of Europe's (colonial) pasts and
presents without]{.mark}** immediately [discounting **the** possibility
of improvement]{.mark}]{.underline} **[coming from the
West]{.underline}**, from Europe. [**Similarly, one can recognise the
myriad problems that Europeans have caused while also** celebrating
**the many** positive things **they have also achieved.**]{.underline}
Moreover, it is possible to use those achievements as inspirations for
better ways of doing things -- as catalysts to new, progressive
creativity and to positive visions of the future. Just as Kraftwerk did
in the **[fragile yet fertile Germany of the second half of the 20th
century when they acknowledged the abyss yet still sought a better
future, including as atonement for that past.]{.underline}** The
cancellation of the future William Gibson recently tweeted ''In the
1920s, the phrase 'the 21st Century' was already popubiquitous. How
often do we see the phrase ''the 22nd Century'', now?''. And it's true
-- we don't have these dates anymore. As a boy, as a young man, I had
mental pictures of the 21st Century. But I don't have any sense of 2050
or 2100 -- except as a deterioration or a collapse. (Simon Reynolds,
Hamburg Sessions 2019, see essay in this issue) I return to Kraftwerk
below but first, a little more is needed on the ramifications of
contemporary hopelessness. [**Rather than striving to create** new
**and** compelling positive]{.underline}, [progressive]{.underline}
[**visions, many thinkers** content themselves with
critique]{.underline} (Austin, 2017) while **[others]{.underline}**,
[**like Grove, see** positive**,** progressive **visions and**
futures]{.underline} -- [**especially those coming from Europe or the
wider West -- as being** necessarily harmful in themselves. This is
postmodernism as hangover]{.underline}. **[The depressed]{.underline}**
-- and depressing -- [**aftermath of the** shortcomings]{.underline},
[broken promises]{.underline} **[and]{.underline}** [unintended
consequences]{.underline} **[of modernisms of different
kinds,]{.underline}** in which strange connections are made and
selective, [guilty memory runs amok]{.underline} (Fisher, 2014).
[Forgetting the good,]{.underline} **[it fuses the bewitchingly
pertinent]{.underline}** **[aspects of the post-positivist critical
project]{.underline}** (which influenced many of us, myself very much
included), [**with more zealously** (self-)destructive **and**
paralysing tendencies]{.underline}. As Fisher puts it: 'Deconstruction
\[is\] a kind of pathology of scepticism, which induced hedging,
infirmity of purpose and compulsory doubt' (2014: 16). In this mode,
[**[scholarship]{.underline}** [**no longer seeks to** invent the train
**but** fixates **on the** train crash]{.underline}]{.mark} [**or even**
pre-empts [**and** precludes the train's invention **for fear of the**
seemingly inescapable imagined train crash to come.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**Like [Grove's]{.mark} denunciation of the future, many of the
[critiques]{.mark} of (popular) modernisms are not so much** wrong
**as** imbalanced]{.underline} (although some are wrong of course,
others not even). [**They [take ]{.mark}**[insufficient account **of
modernisms'** multiple **and** meaningful successes]{.mark}]{.underline}
(there's no time here, but see, e.g. Fisher, 2014: 22; or Meades, 2014,
for a flavour). This leaves us in an odd situation where
**[many]{.underline}** of the **[scholars]{.underline}**, commentators
and others who criticise neoliberalism, capitalist realism and so on[**,
find themselves in de facto agreement with its notion that there should
be** no alternative]{.underline}. In this view, [**we** simply shouldn't
do big vision politics **because our 'schemes to improve the human
condition' have not only 'failed' but will** always**,** inevitably**,**
do more harm than good]{.underline} (Scott, 2008). **[This
approach,]{.underline}** all post and no modern, [**will take us**
nowhere]{.underline}, [even as it fast-forwards the academic careers of
its exponents]{.underline}. The future visions that are left, on the
left, tend to be Marxist ones (see, e.g. Grove, 2019: 198-- 202). Tarred
not only by the brush of the communisms that actually existed (and their
distinctly less balanced ledger than that of modernism more widely) they
understandably fail to inspire mass enthusiasm. Many of their proponents
are still really more interested in explaining the failure to bring
about the inevitable (full communism) in the past and present than in
imagining new futures that go beyond the narrow world view and limiting
subjectivity of too many Marxist approaches (see, e.g. Scribner, 2003;
Sˇitera, 2015). This has done little to address the crisis of hope or to
countervail prevalent contemporary pessimism. [**The** loss of the
belief **in the**]{.underline} [progressive future]{.underline} --
[**that** tomorrow **can be** better **than yesterday and today -- and
the related erosion of faith in our ability to** positively shape our
own destiny]{.underline} **[are]{.underline}** what Berardi (2011: 13)
called '**[the slow cancellation of the future']{.underline}**. As Simon
Reynolds noted in his Hamburg Sessions keynote (included in this issue
of NP), the cancellation may have started slowly in the 1970s, but, by
the 2000s, it had picked up speed and its effects could start to be
seen. The first of these -- its more (neo)liberal variant -- was the
feeling of living in an endless present. For a lot of people in the
West, this has been comfortable in many ways (although often unevenly
and unfairly) and has had distinct advantages over the past (the
extension of rights and opportunities to broader swathes of the
population) but without much hope, optimism or greater purpose. Unless
it provokes the nostalgic responses outlined below, [[**this** endless
present **can lead to**]{.mark} **a sense of** ennui]{.underline},
[[**a** lack of direction]{.mark} **and** loss of momentum]{.underline}.
[**[The]{.mark} second, [more]{.mark} overtly**
[sinister]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [**variant that** fills the vacuum
**left by the** dearth]{.underline} **[of]{.underline}**
[positive]{.underline}]{.mark}, [progressive]{.underline}
[**[visions]{.mark} for the future [takes the form of ]{.mark}**[darker
re-enchantments **focused on the (**imagined) past]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g. Campanella and Dassu\`, 2019). [**Whether '**[making America great
again']{.mark}]{.underline}[, '[taking back
control']{.underline}]{.mark} [**in the United Kingdom or claiming to
offer an '**alternative for Germany']{.underline}, [**these movements
are fundamentally [premised on a ]{.mark}**[backward-looking
politics]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[of]{.underline}**
[nostalgia]{.underline}.]{.mark} [**The** [pessimism]{.mark} about the
present **and** worries about the future]{.underline} [**on which these
movements have each capitalised [have given rise to an
]{.mark}**[increasingly defensive]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[politics

expense of opening up and integrating]{.underline}**.
[[Nativism]{.underline}]{.mark} **[and]{.underline}**
[pessimism]{.underline} [tend to go hand in hand]{.underline}:
**[shrinking pies bring narrowed]{.underline}** **[horizons and hasten
the circling of wagons around exclusive and chauvinistic visions of
national communities]{.underline}**. Too often, this retro-rightism has
been met only with retro-leftism or a tired centrism that merely seeks
more of the same, to smooth the endless present. But that can change
