To achieve these two strategic goals, [NATO allies could agree within
the NATO Defense Planning Process to a military level of ambition for
European strategic responsibility]{.underline}. European allies and
Canada could commit to investing sufficient resources to ensure that, by
the end of the decade, they can meet 50% of NATO's Minimum Capability
Requirements. This would mean fully usable forces required to cover the
whole spectrum of operations and missions, as well as the strategic
enablers needed to conduct multiple large- and small-scale missions ---
if necessary, without U.S. support.

[Meeting this standard will take time, given Europe's current lack of
enablers, its relatively low readiness rates, and its fragmented
military industrial complex. Building European strategic responsibility
will be a process, not a one-time event.]{.underline} At Madrid,
alliance leaders will unveil NATO's new Strategic Concept, its first in
12 years. [The Strategic Concept should launch the process toward
greater European strategic responsibility, reinforced by complementary
efforts to implement the EU's Strategic Compass.]{.underline}

[Greater European strategic responsibility will require more, not less,
trans-Atlantic consultation on political-military matters]{.underline}.
When Europe acquires the military capabilities needed to exercise real
strategic responsibility, its political voice will be amplified.
Diplomatic differences between the United States and Europe will still
arise, but a dialogue among equals is more likely to overcome areas of
disagreement. That said, [new mechanisms for NATO-EU coordination will
be needed.]{.underline}

### Non-unique -- dependent on the US now

Vladimir [Putin's greatest achievement]{.underline} thus far in renewing
his brutal and unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has been [to
reinvigorate the Atlantic alliance]{.underline}. [North
American-European unity has been remarkable]{.underline}, exemplified by
harsh and complementary sanctions against Russia; efforts to wean Europe
off its dangerous dependence on Russian energy; military, financial, and
political support for Ukraine; and actions to strengthen NATO's own
defense.

A [more corrosive effect]{.underline} of Putin's war, however[, has been
to deepen even further Europe's strategic dependence on the United
States]{.underline} --- a trend that had already become unsustainable
even before the conflict began. As the alliance continues its most
urgent task --- helping Ukraine beat back Russia's assault --- it [must
address this important longer-term challenge of rebalancing
trans-Atlantic defense.]{.underline}

[Doing so means squaring a triangle of issues]{.underline}: [ensuring
Europe's capacity to defend]{.underline} itself against Russia and
manage a range of additional crises, many along its southern periphery;
[addressing European aspirations for greater strategic
autonomy;]{.underline} and [maintaining confidence that the United
States can adequately uphold its commitments in both the north Atlantic
and the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}
