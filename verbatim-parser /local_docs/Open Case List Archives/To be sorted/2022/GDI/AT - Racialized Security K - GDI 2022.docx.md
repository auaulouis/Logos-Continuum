## Framework

### AT: Framework is Racist

#### Arguments stand or fall based on whether they are good -- nothing more nothing less -- framework isn't policing

Lets first examine the claim that my book is \"unwittingly\" inviting a
resurrection of the \"Enlightenment-equals-totalitarianism position.\"
[How]{.underline}, one wonders, [could]{.underline} a book [promoting
argument and debate, and promoting reason-giving practices as
a]{.underline} kind of [common ground that should prevail over
assertions of cultural authenticity]{.underline}, [somehow come to be
seen as a]{.underline} [dangerous resurgence of bad Enlightenment?
Robbins tells us why: I want \"argument on my own terms\"-that is, I
want to impose reason on people, which is a form of power and
oppression]{.underline}. [But what can this possibly mean? Arguments
stand or fall]{.underline} [based on whether they are successful and
persuasive, even an argument in favor of argument]{.underline}. [It
simply is not the case that an argument in favor of the importance of
reasoned debate to liberal democracy is]{.underline} [tantamount to
oppressive power]{.underline}. To assume so is to assume, in the manner
of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, that reason is itself violent,
inherently, and that it will always mask power and enforce exclusions.
But to assume this is to assume the very view of Enlightenment reason
that Robbins claims we are \"thankfully\" well rid of. (I leave to the
side the idea that any individual can proclaim that a debate is over,
thankfully or not.) But [perhaps Robbins will say, \"I am not imagining
that your argument is directly oppressive, but that]{.underline} [what
you argue for would be, if it were enforced.\" Yet my book doesn\'t
imagine]{.underline} or [suggest it is enforceable; I
simply]{.underline} [argue in favor of, I promote]{.underline}, [an
ethos of argument within a liberal democratic]{.underline} and
[proceduralist framework]{.underline}. As much as Robbins would like to
think so, [neither I nor the books I write can be cast as an arm of the
police]{.underline}. Robbins wants to imagine a far more direct line of
influence from criticism to political reality, however, and this is why
it can be such a bad thing to suggest norms of argument. Watch as the
gloves come off: Faced with the prospect of submitting to her version of
argument roughly, Habermass version-and of being thus authorized to
disagree only about other, smaller things, some may feel that there will
have been an end to argument, or an end to the arguments they find most
interesting. With current events in mind, I would be surprised if there
were no recourse to the metaphor of a regular army facing a guerilla
insurrection, hinting that Anderson wants to force her opponents to
dress in uniform, reside in well-demarcated camps and capitals that can
be bombed, fight by the rules of states (whether the states themselves
abide by these rules or not), and so on-in short, that she wants to get
the battle onto a terrain where her side will be assured of having the
upper hand. Lets leave to the side the fact that this is a disowned
hypothetical criticism. (As in, \"Well, okay, yes, those are my gloves,
but those are somebody elses hands they will have come off of.\")
Because far more interesting, actually, is the sudden elevation of
stakes. [It is a]{.underline} symptom of the [sorry state of
affairs]{.underline} in our profession [that]{.underline} it [plays
out]{.underline} repeatedly [this]{.underline} [tragicomic tendency to
give a grandiose]{.underline} political [meaning to every
object]{.underline} it analyzes or confronts. We have evidence of how
desperate the situation is when we see it in a critic as thoughtful as
Bruce Robbins, where it emerges as the need to [allegorize]{.underline}
a point about [an argument in such a way that it gets cast as the
equivalent of war atrocities.]{.underline} [It is especially ironic in
light of the fact that to the extent that I do give examples of the
importance of liberal democratic proceduralism, I invoke the disregard
of the protocols of international adjudication in the days leading up to
the invasion of Iraq]{.underline}; I also speak about concerns with
voting transparency. [It is]{.underline} [hard]{.underline} for me [to
see how my argument about proceduralism]{.underline} [can be associated
with the policies of the Bush administration]{.underline} [when that
administration]{.underline} has [exhibited a flagrant disregard of
democratic procedure and the rule of law]{.underline}. I happen to think
that [a renewed focus on proceduralism is a timely venture]{.underline},
which is why I spend so much time discussing it in my final chapter.
[But]{.underline} I hasten to add that [I am not]{.underline} interested
in [imagining that proceduralism is the sole political response to the
needs of cultural criticism in our time: my goal]{.underline} in the
book [is to argue for a]{.underline} [liberal democratic culture of
argument]{.underline}, [and to suggest ways in which argument is not
served by trumping appeals to identity and charismatic
authority]{.underline}. I fully admit that my examples are less
political events than academic debates; for those uninterested in the
shape of intellectual arguments, and eager for more direct and sustained
discussion of contemporary politics, the approach will disappoint.
Moreover, there will always be a tendency for a proceduralist to
under-specify substance, and that is partly a principled decision, since
the point is that agreements, compromises, and policies get worked out
through the communicative and political process. My book is mainly
concentrated on evaluating forms of arguments and appeals to ethos, both
those that count as a form of trump card or distortion, and those that
flesh out an understanding of argument as a universalist practice. There
is an intermittent appeal to larger concerns in the political democratic
culture, and that is because I see connections between the ideal of
argument and the ideal of deliberative democracy. But there is clearly,
and indeed necessarily, significant room for further elaboration here.

### Framework Key to Democracy

#### Effective argumentation is better able to create broader inclusion\-\--radical rejection of existing systems as exclusionary is ineffective and reductionist

**Anderson, Professor of Humanities and English at Brown University, 6**

Vol. 48, No. 2, p. 281-290, AMM\]

In closing, I\'d like to speak briefly to the question of
proceduralism\'s relevance to democratic vitality. One important way of
extending the proceduralist arguments put forth by Habeimas is to work
on how institutions and practices might better promote participation in
democratic life. The [apathy and nonparticipation plaguing democratic
institutions in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is a
serious problem, and can be]{.underline} **[separated
from]{.underline}** the more romantic theoretical investments in a
refusal to accept the terms of what counts as argument, or in
**[assertions of inassimilable difference]{.underline}**. With respect
to [the latter]{.underline}, which [is often glorified precisely as the
moment when politics or democracy is truly occurring]{.underline}, I
would say, [on the contrary]{.underline} **[democracy is not happening
then]{.underline}**-[rather, the]{.underline} limits or **[deficiencies
of an actually existing democracy are making themselves
felt]{.underline}**. [Acknowledging struggle, conflict, and exclusion is
vital to democracy, but]{.underline} [insisting that exclusion is not so
much a persistent challenge for modern liberal democracies but
rather]{.underline} [inherent to the modern liberal-democratic political
form as such]{.underline} [seems]{.underline} to me **[precisely to
remain stalled in a romantic critique of Enlightenment]{.underline}**.
[It]{.underline} all [comes down to a question of]{.underline} [whether
one wants to work with the ideals of democracy or see them as
essentially normative in a negative sense]{.underline}: [this has been
the legacy of a certain critique of Enlightenment, and it is
astonishingly persistent in the left quarters in the
academy]{.underline}. [One hears it clearly when Robbins
makes]{.underline} confident [reference to liberalisms tendency to
ignore \"the founding acts of violence on which a social order is
based]{.underline}.\" One encounters it in the current vogue for the
work of Giorgio Agamben and Carl Schmitt. [Saying that a state of
exception defines modernity or is internal to the law itself
may]{.underline} help to [sharpen your diagnoses of certain historical
conditions,]{.underline} [but **if absolutized**]{.underline} as it is
in these accounts, [it gives you nothing]{.underline} [but a negative
diagnostic and a **compensatory flight** to a realm entirely
other-the]{.underline} kind of [mystical, Utopian impulse that **flees
from these conditions rather than confronts and fights
them**]{.underline} [on terms that derive from the]{.underline}
settled-if constantly evolving-[normative basis of democratic
modernity.]{.underline} [If one is outraged by the flagrant disregard of
democratic procedures in the current U.S. political regime]{.underline},
then [one needs to be able to coherently say why democratic procedures
matter]{.underline}, [what principles underwrite them, and
what]{.underline} historical movements and [institutions have helped us
to secure and support them]{.underline}. [Argument as a critical
practice]{.underline} [and as a]{.underline} **[key component of
democratic institutions and public debate has a vital role to play in
such a task.]{.underline}**

### No Link -- Faulty Assumptions

#### No Link - The K makes broad, faulty assertions about the nature of security studies

**Waever University of Copenhagen and Buzan** **London School of
Economics and Political Science, 20** (Ole and Barry, 2020, Security
Dialogue2020, Vol. 51(4) 386--394, \"Racism and responsibility --The
critical limits of deepfake methodology in security studies: A reply to

*H&RM=Howell and Richter-Montpetit*

[One assertion is central to H&RM's article, dominating the abstract:
that the concepts of securitization and desecuritization are distributed
in time and space so that securitization is a threatening re-regression
lurking in a backward black Africa, while desecuritization is a
reasoned, liberal, civilized dialogue characteristic of Europe
(]{.underline}and our prescribed future). [We already debunked their
attempt to pose Europe as the poster child for desecuritization. **H&RM
depict Africa as the essence of securitization, but offer no reason why
Africa should be seen as constitutive for the theory**]{.underline}.
**[The foundational misunderstanding in H&RM's article on which their
whole argument hangs is an alleged 'conceptualization of "normal
politics" as reasoned, civilized dialogue']{.underline}** (H&RM, 2020: 3
\[1\]). In Buzan et al. (1998), we write: [Of course, places do exist
where secrecy or violation of rights is the rule and where security
arguments are not needed to legitimize such acts]{.underline}. The
earlier illustrations were for a liberal-democratic society; in [other
societies there will also be 'rules,' as there are in any society, and
when a securitizing actor uses a rhetoric of existential threat and
thereby takes an issue out of what under those conditions is 'normal
politics,' we have a case of securitization]{.underline}. (Buzan et al.,
1998: 24--25, emphasis added)

Thus, quite explicitly, '**[normal politics' is not a politics with some
specific attributes ('liberal', 'civilized', 'reasoned'); it is whatever
passed as normal until an exception was installed through
securitization]{.underline}**. H&RM do not consult the existing
secondary literature on this, but instead repeatedly restate [their own
(false) definition that 'normal politics' means reasoned, liberal,
civilized dialogue]{.underline}. From there, **[they associate freely
into this being 'a teleological hierarchy of civilizational advancement
from securitization towards politicization' (]{.underline}**H&RM, 2020:
8 \[6\]). This characterization they support with a reference to pp. 53
and 69 in the Framework book. **[It looks damning when H&RM write thus
and back it with a reference; but, if you read those pages, there is
absolutely no hint of securitization-to-politicization being cast in
evolutionary or civilizational terms]{.underline}**. [Their article
contains dozens of similar instances, where they make a reference to our
texts but what you find there is not what they claim]{.underline}.

Significantly, **[their definition of 'normal politics' could not work
for securitization theory]{.underline}**, because, as argued very
strongly by Wæver (2011, 2015), t[he theory needs a clean concept of
securitization as a distinct operation that is contrasted simply to the
non-securitized (called 'normal politics'), not a substantial concept of
'normal politics' as holding particular teleological (e.g. liberal
democratic) qualities. **Securitization is an 'operation' that is
available for deployment and contestation in all societies at all
times**]{.underline}. [The unprofessional citation practices of H&RM are
the smaller problem;]{.underline} **[the big one is that they don't
read. They inject elements into the theory that both aren't there and
couldn't be there.]{.underline}** [Methodology matters]{.underline}.

**[H&RM avoid understanding the theory they are
attacking]{.underline}**. [On the second page of their article, they
state that securitization theory has been attractive because 'it
provides a clear set of steps and standards for . . . deciding whether
\[the referent objects\] should indeed be "securitized]{.underline}"'
(H&RM, 2020: 4 \[2\]). **[No. The theory does not aim to guide when
something 'should be securitized'. It is a framework for analysing what
happens when something is securitized and the politics of struggles over
this act]{.underline}**. [It is argued systematically in all the major
works]{.underline} (and has been a common target of criticism) [that
securitization theory cannot and will not prescribe when something
'should be securitized']{.underline}. H&RM make no attempt to present
the securitization theory project, its animating agenda, and the
political or academic setting into which the texts intervened. [If they
had explained what the theory and the key texts were designed to
achieve, they simply could not argue as they do]{.underline}

[H&RM generally use quotations radically out of context.]{.underline}
[They never study what is done in the texts they are 'reading'. They say
nothing about their own methodology or data selection and give no
principles for interpretation]{.underline}. **[They do not define
racism]{.underline}** (see response by Lene Hansen \[2020\]), **[and
they don't discuss at all what it means to read a theory and judge
whether it is racist]{.underline}**. Given that this is the theme of the
article, it is disturbing that Security Dialogue has published **[it.
Despite H&RM's repeated assertions about something being 'foundational'
to securitization theory, they do not follow any standards for how to
find what is 'foundational' for, or 'structures', a
theory]{.underline}**. [If there is a methodology at play, it is
deepfake in the sense that if you break a corpus of text down into small
fragments, you can reassemble it to say anything you want]{.underline}.
[Deepfake as analogy does not imply any claim about intentional
falsehood. The analogy is to the technique: making somebody 'speak' by
using splinters from them reassembled to produce meaning disconnected
from the original texts]{.underline}. **[H&RM present no theoretical
framework. We can't backtrack their theoretical position from scattered
citations.]{.underline}** Impressive forerunners do exactly what they
don't: Stoler (1995) and Mills (1997) trace meticulously how their
analysed theorists struggle to do specific things, and then what role
race plays in enabling this. **[H&RM, in contrast, ignore what
securitization theory attempts and how it works]{.underline}**.

### No Link -- Security Intersectional

#### Generic link homogenizes international relations, prefer situated and empirical evidence

**Gomes, Federal University of Santa Maria Brazil Social Sciences
Professor and Marques, Federal University International Relations
researcher, 21** (Mariana Selister and Renata Rodrigues , "Can
securitization theory be saved from itself? A decolonial and feminist
intervention", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 78-87, EBSCO, GDI
access 7/12/22)

The concept of **[intersectionality is essential for
understanding]{.underline}** the main structures of modem society -
patriarchy, racism, and capitalism - that demarcate people's lives and
political processes, and, consequently, the dynamics of **[international
security]{.underline}**. These social structures that interact with each
other create the categories of women, race, and class (Davis, 1981) that
segregate and hier- archize social groups. In dialogue with
intersectional theory, decolonial feminism (Lugones, 2010) places these
three dimensions in an international perspective, emphasizing the idea
of coloniality. **[Thus, patriarchy, racism, and capitalism are the main
social structures strongly demarcated by historical colonialism and its
roots in the economy, politics and culture that persist to the present
day]{.underline}**, establishing what Lugones defines as the
'colonial/modem gender system'.

**[Although these concepts can lead to different paths of analysis,
their epistemological common ground allows us to advocate that
coloniality, racialization, and genderization are products of his-
torical constmctions, neither universal nor essential.]{.underline}**
**[Culturally and historically situated analysis of securitization
processes has the capacity to incorporate social classification
configurations such as racialization and genderization]{.underline}**,
although we do not see this happening very often. We intend to
illustrate in the next section how the conduct of **[empirical research
plays a decisive role in efforts to analyze the social configurations of
power in securitization processes.]{.underline}**

### Case Outweighs -- Extinction

#### Existential threats outweigh -- correct cognitive biases against them 

**Farquhar et al 17** (Sebastian, former head of the global priorities
project, "Existential Risk: Diplomacy and Governance." Global Priorities
Project, 2017,
<https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf>,
Accessed 7/17/20, GDI -- JMoore)

1.2. THE ETHICS OF EXISTENTIAL RISK

In his book Reasons and Persons, Oxford philosopher Derek Parfit
advanced an influential argument about the importance of avoiding
extinction:

I believe that if we destroy mankind, as we now can, this outcome will
be much worse than most people think. [Compare]{.underline} three
outcomes:

[(1) Peace.]{.underline}

[(2) A nuclear war that kills 99% of the world's ex- isting
population.]{.underline}

[(3) A nuclear war that kills 100%.]{.underline}

\(2\) would be worse than (1), and (3) would be worse than (2). Which is
the greater of these two differences? Most people believe that the
greater difference is between (1) and (2). I believe that [the
difference between (2) and (3) is very much greater]{.underline}. \...
[The Earth will remain habitable for at least another billion
years.]{.underline} Civilization began only a few thousand years ago. If
we do not destroy mankind, these few thousand years may be only a tiny
fraction of the whole of civilized human history. The difference between
(2) and (3) may thus be the difference between this tiny fraction and
all of the rest of this history. If we compare this possible his- tory
to a day, what has occurred so far is only a fraction of a second.65

In this argument, it seems that Parfit is assuming that the [survivors
of a]{.underline} nuclear [war that kills 99% of the population would
eventually be able to recover civilisation without long-term
effect.]{.underline} As we have seen, this may not be a safe assumption
-- but for the purposes of this thought experiment, the point stands.
[What makes existential catastrophes especially bad is that they would
"destroy the future,"]{.underline} as another Oxford philosopher, Nick
Bostrom, puts it.66 [This future could potentially be extremely long and
full of flourishing, and would therefore have extremely large
value.]{.underline} In standard risk analysis, when working out how to
respond to risk, we work out the expected value of risk reduction, by
weighing the probability that an action will prevent an adverse event
against the severity of the event. [Because the value of pre- venting
existential catastrophe is so vast, even a tiny probability of
prevention has huge expected value.]{.underline}67

Of course, there is persisting reasonable disagreement about ethics and
there are a number of ways one might resist this conclusion.68
Therefore, it would be unjustified to be overconfident in Parfit and
Bostrom's argument.

In some areas, government policy does give significant weight to future
generations. For example, in assessing the risks of nuclear waste
storage, [governments have considered timeframes of
thousands]{.underline}, hundreds of thousands, [and even a million
years.]{.underline}69 [Justifications]{.underline} for this policy
usually [appeal]{.underline} [to]{.underline} principles of
[intergenerational equity]{.underline} according to which [future
generations ought]{.underline} [to get as much protection as current
generations.]{.underline}70 Similarly, widely accepted norms of
sustainable development require development that meets the needs of the
current generation without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs.71

However, when it comes to existential risk, it would seem that we fail
to live up to principles of intergenerational equity. [Existential
catastrophe would not only give future generations less than the current
generations; it would give them nothing.]{.underline} Indeed, [reducing
existential risk plausibly]{.underline} [has a quite low cost for us in
comparison with the huge expected value it has for future
generations.]{.underline} In spite of this, relatively little is done to
reduce existential risk. Unless we give up on norms of intergenerational
equity, they give us a strong case for significantly increasing our
efforts to reduce existential risks.

1.3. WHY EXISTENTIAL RISKS MAY BE SYSTEMATICALLY UNDERINVESTED IN, AND
THE ROLE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY

[In spite of]{.underline} the [importance of existential
risk]{.underline} re- duction, it probably [receives less attention than
is warranted.]{.underline} As a result, concerted international co-
operation is required if we are to receive adequate protection from
existential risks.

1.3.1. Why existential risks are likely to be underinvested in

There are several reasons why existential risk re- duction is likely to
be underinvested in. Firstly, it is a global public good. Economic
theory predicts that such goods tend to be underprovided. The benefits
of existential risk reduction are widely and indivisibly dispersed
around the globe from the countries responsible for taking action.
Consequently, a country which reduces existential risk gains only a
small portion of the benefits but bears the full brunt of the costs.
Countries thus have strong incentives to free ride, receiving the
benefits of risk reduction without contributing. As a result, too few do
what is in the common interest.

Secondly, as already suggested above, [existential risk reduction is an
intergenerational public good: most of the benefits are enjoyed by
future generations]{.underline} who have no say in the political
process. For these goods, [the problem is temporal free riding: the
current generation enjoys the benefits of inaction while future
generations bear]{.underline} [the costs.]{.underline}

Thirdly, many existential risks, such as machine superintelligence,
engineered pandemics, and solar geoengineering, pose an unprecedented
and uncertain future threat. Consequently, it is hard to develop a
satisfactory governance regime for them: there are few existing
governance instruments which can be applied to these risks, and it is
unclear what shape new instruments should take. In this way, our
position with regard to these emerging risks is comparable to the one we
faced when nuclear weapons first became available.

[Cognitive biases]{.underline} also [lead people to underestimate
existential risks.]{.underline} [Since there have not been any
catastrophes of this magnitude, these risks are not salient to
politicians and the public.]{.underline}72 This is an example of the
misapplication of the availability heuristic, a mental shortcut which
assumes that something is important only if it can be readily recalled.

[Another cognitive bias affecting perceptions of existential risk is
scope neglect.]{.underline} In a seminal 1992 study, three groups were
asked how much they would be willing to pay to save 2,000, 20,000 or
200,000 birds from drowning in uncovered oil ponds. The groups answered
\$80, \$78, and \$88, respectively.73 In this case, the size of the
benefits had little effect on the scale of the preferred response.
People be- come numbed to the effect of saving lives when the numbers
get too large. 74 Scope neglect is a particularly acute problem for
existential risk because the numbers at stake are so large. Due to scope
neglect, [decision-makers are prone to treat existential risks in a
similar way to problems which are less severe by many orders of
magnitude. A wide range of other cognitive biases are likely to affect
the evaluation of existential risks.]{.underline}75

### Case Outweighs -- Russia Adv

#### The K sanitizes russian authoritarianism

**Dearment, senior reporter at MedCity News covering biotech
22** (Alaric Dearment, , 2-14-2022,  Above the Law, \"Russia Plays
Western 'Anti-War' Left For Fools - Above the Law\",
https://abovethelaw.com/2022/02/russia-plays-western-anti-war-left-for-fools/ accessed
on 7-12-2022, hooch//cs)

[The basic premise of these ideas is that the US and NATO should do
nothing substantial to deter Russia from invading and then sit on their
hands if it actually does invade]{.underline}. **[The bigger question is
why so many leftists who claim to be anti-war and anti-imperialist would
give succor to Russia as it engages in the very warmongering and
imperialism they claim to deplore.]{.underline}**

[One possible reason is a longstanding binary worldview that sees the US
as the main cause of the world's problems and so irredeemably evil that
it praises any nation opposing its interests]{.underline} -- e.g., the
Soviet Union during the Cold War, Russia in the present, China,
Venezuela or Syria. **[This inevitably leads to double standards when it
comes to imperialism and human rights abuses and a tendency to blame the
US and its allies first.]{.underline}**

The Iraq war didn't help either, giving rise to isolationism and
kneejerk cynicism about American foreign policy whereby anything
emanating from the Pentagon or State Department is assumed to be a lie.
[But unlike Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,]{.underline} **[Russia's
forces amassed along Ukraine's border are clearly
visible.]{.underline}**

Another is Russian propaganda, disseminated by state-owned outlets like
RT and Sputnik. [They have been tremendously successful at pumping
pro-Russian ideas into Western political discourse while also promoting
anti-system populist politics aimed at exacerbating divisions and
destabilizing democracies.]{.underline} Kremlin propagandists can count
every Westerner sincerely arguing Russia has "legitimate concerns" about
"NATO expansion" as a success story.

But **[a larger reason is a failure to admit what Russia actually is and
always has been, which is a colonial empire, every bit as much as its
Spanish, British and French counterparts]{.underline}**. [The
differences are that it was an empire of land rather than sea, and that
with the collapse of the monarchy in 1917 it slapped a left-wing
revolutionary coat of paint onto a state that remained just as
imperialist as when the tsars ruled from Petrograd.]{.underline}

That's why Georgia's first tenure as a democratic republic after
declaring independence in 1918 lasted only three years, ending with the
Red Army invading and taking over the country in 1921. Armenia and
independence movements in Central Asia experienced similar fates.

Consequently, [the decolonization that Spain, the UK and other European
powers underwent after World War II didn't come to Russia until 1991,
when the Soviet Union collapsed. That decolonization is what Putin
referred to as "the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century" in
2005]{.underline}.

But [where other former European colonial powers are content to let
their former colonies govern their own affairs, Putin cannot tolerate
former Russian colonies doing the same.]{.underline} **[That's why
pro-democratic uprisings in post-Soviet countries -- most recently
Belarus and Kazakhstan -- scare him so much and is likely the reason he
has his eyes on Ukraine.]{.underline}** After all, a Ukraine that is
free, democratic and prosperous and enjoys close ties with the West
threatens his ill-gotten power and wealth, [as it might cause Russians
to start asking why they can't have democracy and prosperity
too.]{.underline}

[**If a war breaks out in Europe, it will happen because a predatory,
kleptocratic mafia state presided over by a psychopathic dictator
started it**. It will be because all the diplomacy in the world could
not stop Putin's revanchist desire to restore Soviet power]{.underline}.
**[Undermining efforts to prevent that from happening or punish Putin's
regime if he does invade isn't anti-war]{.underline}**.

[Is there a more urgent problem]{.underline} in the world today [than
war?]{.underline} And when I say \"war\" in this post, I mean also
militarism, the culture of war, the armies, arms, industries, policies,
plans, propaganda, prejudices, rationalizations that make lethal group
conflict not only possible but also likely.

My answer to the above question: [No]{.underline}, there is no more
urgent problem than war. [Not climate change, pollution, overpopulation,
oppression, poverty, inequality, hunger, disease.]{.underline}

[If you seek solutions to any of these problems, you should]{.underline}

perpetuates our other problems, either directly or by
draining]{.underline} precious [resources away from their
solution.]{.underline} [War]{.underline} subverts democracy and promotes
tyranny and fanaticism; [kills and sickens and impoverishes people;
ravages nature. War is a keystone problem]{.underline}, the eradication
of which would make our other social problems much more tractable.

Second, [war]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [more readily
solvable]{.underline} than many other human afflictions. [War is
not]{.underline} like a hurricane, earthquake or Ebola plague, a natural
disaster foisted on us by forces [beyond our control.]{.underline} [War
is entirely our creation]{.underline}, the product of human choices. War
could end tomorrow if a relatively small group of people around the
world chose to end it.

Third, more than any of our other problems, [war represents a horrific
moral crime.]{.underline} Particularly when carried out by the U.S. and
other nations, or by groups that aspire to or claim the legitimacy of
states, [war makes hypocrites of us and makes a mockery of human
progress. We cannot claim to be civilized as long as war or even the
threat of war persists.]{.underline}

Yes, [annual war casualties have declined]{.underline} sharply since the
cataclysmic first half of the 20th century. Over the last few decades,
war has killed far fewer people than cancer or automobile accidents.
[But in our heavily---and nuclear---armed world, war is a few decisions
away from becoming exponentially more destructive.]{.underline} And even
the killing of a single child by a U.S. drone, Israeli rocket or Syrian
tank is an abomination that corrupts us all.

## Permutation

### Perm -- Do Both: Eclecticism

#### Perm -- Do Both -- Security is contingent not a fixed construct, approaching perm as eclecticism best way to evaluate and synthesize disparate paradigms. 

**Makinda, Murdoch University, International Relations and Security
Studies Professor, 21** (Samuel M., Perth, Australia, "Critical security
studies, racism and eclecticism", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
142-151, EBSCO)

I argue here that **[one of the appropriate reparative possibilities for
critical security studies lies in eclecticism]{.underline}**. Those who
have employed eclecticism in the past have described it as **[a process
through which scholars trespass paradigmatic boundaries and combine
insights from different par- adigms to analyse a given
problem]{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000a; Sil and Katzenstein, 2010). For
example, Katzenstein and Sil have argued that 'eclecticism **[is
distinguished by the fact that features of analy- ses in theories
initially embedded in separate research traditions can be separated from
their respective foundations, translated meaningfully, and recombined as
part of an original permuta- tion of concepts, methods, analytics, and
empirics']{.underline}** (Katzenstein and Sil, 2008: 110-111, emphasis
in original). Earlier, I had defined eclecticism 'as a process through
**[which a theorist constructs a coherent analytical approach by
utilizing, synthesizing and reflecting on insights from disparate
paradigms']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 398). I posited that
eclecticists would need to meet some conditions. 'First, they would need
**[to recognize, but at the same time refuse to be confined by,
paradigmatic horizons']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 400). Explaining
that eclecticism had the potential to emancipate scholars from
paradigmatic constraints, I argued **[that the refusal by eclecticists
'to be bound by paradigmatic boundaries requires acknowledgement that
these socio-mental constrictions are not fixed, but
contingent']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 400). I added that
**[eclecticism could be used to 'explore the possibilities of pursuing
an \[international relations\] discipline that takes account of the
percep- tions of us/them, self/other and inside/outside in non-European
traditions']{.underline}** (Makinda, 2000b: 399).

### Perm -- Do Both: Eclecticism -- 1AR

#### Claims to alt exclusivity turns the K

**Makinda, Murdoch University, International Relations and Security
Studies Professor, 21** (Samuel M., Perth, Australia, "Critical security
studies, racism and eclecticism", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
142-151, EBSCO)

While critical security studies emerged from a cross-fertilization of
ideas, cultures and traditions representing different parts of the
world, it has increasingly been made to identify itself with European
values, traditions and thoughts that go back to the critiques of
modernity and the Enlightenment. This identification with one source of
ideas has meant that critical security studies continues to exclude from
the conversation a large part of the world that gave birth to it. The
con- clusion is that [critical security studies has not only missed the
benefits that come with the cross- fertilization of ideas, but also
alienated itself from its own foundations.]{.underline} Moreover, [by
aspiring to become a paradigm that competes with other security studies
para- digms for hegemony, critical security studies has unwittingly
compromised some of its principles and ethical commitments]{.underline}.
The strength of critical security studies comes from its ability to
expose the forces of oppression and domination, but it cannot do so
effectively when it is promoting the hegemony of ideas associated with
Gramsci and the Frankfurt School. [It]{.underline} also [cannot
consistently seek to eliminate exclusion and advocate inclusion when it
is establishing its own strict boundary lines.]{.underline}

#### Perm solves - 

**Makinda, Murdoch University, International Relations and Security
Studies Professor, 21** (Samuel M., Perth, Australia, "Critical security
studies, racism and eclecticism", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S)
142-151, EBSCO)

I recommend [eclecticism as a reparative possibility]{.underline} for
critical security studies through which the competing research
programmes would be on a par. One of its benefits is that it [can
provide a platform for negotiating over, and mediating, the competing
normative and political agendas that underpin paradigms]{.underline}. As
Neufeld (1993) has argued, [reflexivity acknowledges that differences
between international relations paradigms are inherently
normative]{.underline} and that 'reasoned assessment' can adjudicate
between competing normative claims. With such an approach, it would be
our hon- esty, our [willingness to engage in dialogue with those
who]{.underline} may [disagree]{.underline} with us [and]{.underline}
our readiness to [acknowledge]{.underline} our [debts to fellow
scholars]{.underline} that [will pave the way for a robust, inclusive
and ethi- cal critical security studies.]{.underline}

### Perm -- Do Both (Abolition)

#### Perm -- Do Both -- Embrace vulnerability and fugitivity challenges colonial impulse to mastery, collapsing activism and academia

**Manchanda, Queen Mary University London International Politics Senior
Lecturer, 21** (Dr Nivi, "The banalization of race in international
security studies: From absolution to abolition", Security Dialogue 2021,
Vol. 52(S) 49-59, EBSCO, GDI access 7/12/22)

In the third and final instance, and somewhat counter-intuitively,
[international security studies can turn to alternate modes of knowing
that reject the foreclosure inherent in colonial and raced
understandings of]{.underline} concepts such as 'liberty' and
'[security']{.underline}. Bamor Hesse (2014: 288) ventures that the
cherished notion of 'liberty' emerges through a 'hegemony of Western
formulation' that denies its 'indebtedness to Western colonialism'. This
holds equally true for 'security' and for synthetic accounts of
'ontological insecurity', 'securitization theory' and 'deterrence' at
the crux of the (sub) discipline. [One way out of this impasse is for
international security studies to be open to]{.underline} what Julietta
Singh (2017: 21) has called [a 'vulnerable reading']{.underline}. A
vulnerable reading of international security studies' own history and
the challenges it faces both in its theory and in practice [would go
against its colonial impulse towards 'mastery']{.underline} (J. Singh,
2017) [and instead expand the conditions of possibility for the
field]{.underline}. Pushing further, embracing '[vulnerability' as a
strategy would mount a wholesale challenge to the conventional
objectives]{.underline} of international security studies and its auxil-
iary concept 'resilience'. [Vulnerability necessarily engenders
exposure, as opposed to foreclosur]{.underline}e. In the context of a
pandemic, it might entail pushing back against medical police (McQuade
and Neocleous, 2020) and resisting greater border violence, even as they
appear warranted. [This 'open- ing up']{.underline} of international
security studies both politically and strategically [is not a panacea,
but can function as an important remedial step. Coupled with an
engagement with the Black radical tradi- tion's notion of 'fugitivity'-
a form of 'political escape from the Western hegemony']{.underline}
(Hesse, 2014: 302) [and the colonial architecture of knowledge -
vulnerability proffers a question if not an answer: what does it mean to
escape from immurement by]{.underline} conventional (read: [raced)
notions of security?]{.underline}

Nonetheless, if de-raced notions of security offer only a contradiction,
then to begin to answer the question one must once again turn to
abolition. [Abolition looks at connections]{.underline} - between polic-
ing and border violence, between the incarceration of indigenous
populations, detainees and people of colour and their continued
dispossession, expropriation and extraction. Robin Kelley (2020)
succinctly captures its tenor thus: 'Abolition works to dismantle
systems that have caused harm, namely police and prisons, and reallocate
funds to social and economic resources, and to develop new systems of
community-controlled public safety and restorative justice'. This
purposeful diversion of funds, resources and other energies away from
the structural violence of state-sponsored militarism, to alternate
political projects, requires astute research and scholarly analysis. [By
continuing to uphold the tactical separation of 'activism' and
'academia' and subli- mating 'race' as an exclusive concern of the
former domain, in keeping with its political theory and international
relations antecedents, international security studies ensures racial
events remain for- ever 'banalized']{.underline}. [Challenging this
assumed incommensurability and putting activism, policy and scholarship
back in their relational context would allow international security
studies to also dis- card some of its ahistoricity, specifically with
regard to its colonial roots.]{.underline}

[These strategies]{.underline} are not light-touch; they [cannot be
simply appropriated and tacked on]{.underline} in an attempt to shed the
anachronism of international security studies, but require a
fundamental - and relational - volte face that many would no doubt argue
is impossible for a discipline so steeped in, and governed by, the
logics of coloniality. Indeed, as we have seen, 'security' is a key node
in the racialized theoretical apparatus of not only international
relations but also political theory. [Nevertheless, a sustained effort
to undo and unlearn - to denaturalize - the categories of both the
'lecture hall' and the 'professional journal', to perform what Harney
and Moten]{.underline} (2013: 36) [call 'the enactment of a security
breach' ad nauseam, can fashion a break from international security
stud- ies' racial filiation]{.underline}. [A 'decolonial' discipline may
not be achievable, but an anti-racist one is not just possible but also
essential.]{.underline} The politics of recognition and repentance is
not enough. To paraphrase Ruth Wilson Gilmore (forthcoming): in order to
change security studies, we have to change everything.

[A related critique posed against abolition, is that carceral abolition
also actively opposes certain kinds of solutions and
desires]{.underline}. [Abolition critiques the carceral system and
carceral logics, but also critiques efforts to reform carceral sites,
because some of the factors lead- ing to the growth of the carceral
State were the direct result of attempts to reform the sys-
tem]{.underline}. This is also directly linked to the lineage of
abolition of slavery. As Kim Gilmore (2000) explains, "The connections
between slavery and imprisonment have been used by abolitionists as a
historical explanation and as part of a radical political strategy that
ques- tions the feasibility of "reform" as an appropriate response to
prison expansion."

[In practice, reform and abolition are on a continuum.]{.underline} For
example, in Politics of Abo- lition, Mathiesen (1974) follows Andre
Gorz's [distinction between reformist and 'non- reformist' reforms.
Reformist reforms are situated in the status quo, so that any changes
are made within or against this existing framework. Non reformist
reforms imagine a different horizon and are not limited by a discussion
of what is possible at present]{.underline}. Mathiesen states

[that non-reformist reforms that are effective need to be of the
abolishing kind.]{.underline} [The question is what kinds of reforms are
sought and whether they will strengthen the system in the long
run]{.underline} (Ben-Moshe 2013; Kaba 2014). For instance, [fighting
for adequate health care for pris- oners is something abolitionists
often support, as a non-reformist reform]{.underline}. However, some
initiatives such as mental health jails are opposed by abolitionists, as
these would only expand the scope of incarceration in the long haul.

[But, critics say, if everything offered can be conceived as being
reformist, what solu- tions does the abolitionist offer? I suggest that
this question is rooted in the kind of episte- mological assumptions
that are better abandoned by abolitionists. This demand only makes sense
if it is engrained in privileged positionality and not in intersectional
subjugated knowledge, or maroonage, as those already oppressed do not
feel secure in the first place]{.underline}. In short, as Ahmed (2010a)
explains, this is the work of the feminist killjoy: "Feminists, by
declaring themselves feminists, are already read as destroying something
that is thought of by others not only as being good but as the cause of
happiness" (2010a: 581). Feminists (and other affect aliens, as Ahmed
refers to them, including abolitionists) "hence brings others down, not
only by talking about unhappy topics such as sexism but by exposing how
happiness is sustained, by erasing the signs of not getting along"
(2010a: 582). If we take this one step further to intersectional
struggles "The angry black woman can be described as a killjoy; she may
even kill feminist joy, for example, by pointing out forms of racism
within feminist politics" (2010a: 583).

[The call of "don't talk about it unless you have a solution" assumes
there is a monolithic answer to the question of 'what is to be
done']{.underline}. [As Davis (2003) contends, as abolitionists,
thinking about substitutions to prisons or incarceration is
inapt]{.underline}. [Instead we should concep- tualize a world without
the footprint of the prison]{.underline}. [That is exactly the problem
with car- ceral locales]{.underline}---such as detention centers, psych
hospitals, prisons---[they become catch all solutions to diverse social
issues.]{.underline} [One of the difficulties of conceptualizing a world
without prisons is that many think about a monolithic system that will
replace the punitive one we have now. Instead, we will need to deal with
to handle certain harms and their effects in a myriad of
ways.]{.underline}

[Abolitionists work on a case by case basis in their campaigns, research
and calls for action]{.underline}. They are often in a position of not
knowing what to do. [This seeming chasm between pragmatism and vision
for the future of a non-carceral society are not necessar- ily binary
opposites]{.underline}, [especially if we think about it through the
duality of the both/and approach suggested by Harbin (2016) in relation
to the epistemology of disorientation as being generative.]{.underline}

## Alternative

### Alternative Fails -- Rejection Bad

#### Essentializing critiques of security studies restricts productive engagements with the field

Studies, 21** (Rens, 2021,  Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 88--97,

Following Bhambra, [Howell and Richter-Montpetit's diagnosis is driven
by a suspicion that central approaches in critical security studies may
inadvertently reproduce racialized forms of exclusion and
violence]{.underline}. Suspicion has a rich history in critical
theorizing. Paul Ricœur (1970) famously coined the notion of
'hermeneutics of suspicion' to denote an analytical ethos that he
associated with Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In his
view, [these authors shared a commitment towards exposing the truth
hidden beneath the surface appearance of reality. Things, in other
words, are not what they seem.]{.underline} The hermeneutics of
suspicion continues to play a significant role today -- for example, in
the idea of speaking truth to power -- and informs various international
relations approaches, including some forms of realist theory. [In
critical security studies, however, the hermeneutics of suspicion has
given way to a different form of suspicion, **one that does not seek to
uncover the real intentions or interests behind or beneath discourse but
instead explores the systematic reproduction of violence and exclusions
through discourse and practice**]{.underline}. It is a form of critique
that is suspicious about the context, [uptake and circulation of
concepts and theories, and what is lost, marginalized or silenced in the
(re)production of that knowledge.]{.underline} [**Howell and
Richter-Montpetit are explicit that their analysis is of the latter
kind. Their claim is not that critical security studies scholars
secretly pursue a racist agenda under the veneer of science, but that
central concepts in critical security studies**, such as biopolitics or
securitization**, perform racial work and, in doing so, contribute to
the reproduction of racial hierarchies**]{.underline} [and white
supremacy]{.underline}

Bearing in mind that international relations theory, including critical
international relations theory, has contributed to the reproduction and
hence naturalization of whiteness in world politics, a healthy dose of
suspicion about epistemic racism and methodological whiteness is clearly
warranted (see, for example, Hobson, 2007; Sabaratnam, 2020; Vitalis,
2015). Yet [there are also some in-built limits to the critical ethos of
suspicion]{.underline}. In Ricœur's original formulation, **[the limit
is that of a structural paranoia grounded in a profound mistrust of
reality]{.underline}**. **[Paranoia]{.underline}** [can be a productive
force**, but is also unidirectional, anticipatory and
elitist**]{.underline} ([the claim to have privileged access to a truth
hidden from others)]{.underline} (for a discussion, see Sedgwick, 1997).
**[The kind of suspicion Howell and RichterMontpetit subscribe to seeks
to transcend the limits of paranoia. It abandons the idea of a layered
reality and sidesteps the issue of intentions and
interests]{.underline}** (Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2020: 4). Still,
similar problems remain. In particular, [the fallacy of essentialism
looms large. In Howell and Richter-Montpetit's analysis, such
essentialism manifests itself in their conviction that the epistemic
racism]{.underline} they identify in the Copenhagen School is
[inescapable and automatically reproduced with every attempt at
rearticulation. For them, any recuperation of securitization theory is
doomed to repeat the original sin of racism -- just as securitization
theory itself cannot but repeat the racism present in the work of
authors on which it draws]{.underline} (Howell and Richter-Montpetit,
2020: 7--9). It is worth citing their conclusion in length:

Once classic securitization theory is stripped of its racist conceptual
and methodological apparatus . . . there is very little left. Perhaps
what remains is simply the word 'securitization'. But even this word is
potentially problematic, because inherent in it is a temporal move from
normal politics towards the (exceptional) violence of security. Authors
attempting to recuperate the term 'securitization' must take care not to
indulge in white nostalgia for a better, more innocent time: a time that
does not exist for those who have been subject to colonialism or the
racial contract on scales from the local to the global -- that is to
say, the majority of the world's people. Such a recuperative
intellectual project, if at all possible, has yet to be articulated.
(Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2020: 17)

[Suspicion can serve the critical objective of historicizing and
contextualizing seemingly abstract or neutral concepts such as
securitization or biopolitics**, but here it transforms into an
essentialist argument that instead fixes the meaning and character of
words, concepts and theories across time and space.**]{.underline}
Characterized by a unidirectional anticipation of the future, [such a
view entails that structural forms of injustice, such as epistemic
racism, can be simply presumed to follow every time the 'S-word' is
uttered.]{.underline} As an intellectual strategy, **[such a finalistic
version of suspicion does not serve the field of critical security
studies well.]{.underline}** Indeed, [Howell and Richter-Montpetit fail
to acknowledge that almost **every empirical 'application' of
securitization theory has involved a serious rearticulation of its core
concepts and their relations**]{.underline}. These rearticulations
could, of course, reproduce problematic assumptions about race that
taint the empirical analysis or foreclose important avenues of inquiry,
but this is not a matter that can be adjudicated in advance. [Nor is it
true that such recuperative projects do not exist]{.underline}. For
example, [**Claudia Aradau's (2004) radical rearticulation of
desecuritization seems to avoid the pitfalls Howell and
Richter-Montpetit associate with the Copenhagen School.** Her
work]{.underline}, as well as that of others, [shows that thinking with
a theory often also involves thinking against that theory and
illustrates how new or more progressive interpretations often cannot
exist without prior ones.]{.underline}

In addition, **[the risk of confirmation bias -- the tendency for an
analyst to read selectively and overlook or exclude examples that do not
fit her or his assumptions -- looms large]{.underline}** [in such
essentialist forms of suspicion]{.underline}. [Despite significant
differences in tone, both Lene Hansen's (2020) rejoinder and the
response by Ole Wæver and Barry Buzan (2020) point out]{.underline}
**[that Howell and RichterMontpetit's analysis of securitization theory
suffers from this methodological fallacy.]{.underline}** Howell and
Richter-Montpetit's critique of Foucauldian security studies admittedly
leaves more room for recuperative readings,4 but at times runs up
against similar problems. [For example, it is not evident on the basis
of what criteria the field of Foucauldian security studies is
delineated, and at times it appears set up in such a way as to
corroborate pre-existing suspicions]{.underline}.5 To be sure, [theories
and concepts may at times come with heavy historical baggage that
overdetermines their meaning. Still, even then, the criticality of a
rearticulation depends not just on the theories and thinkers invoked,
but also on what such an engagement forecloses or opens up]{.underline}.
**[Suspicion]{.underline}** is an indispensable part of critical
theorizing **[but can also unduly restrict productive engagements with
prior work, including critical security studies' own intellectual
ancestry]{.underline}**.

Needless to say, [the theoretical and philosophical discussions for this
less state-centric definition of security are anchored in the English
school and liberal internationalists. But more often than not their
contribution is obscured by the disagreements within the aca- demic
discipline of international relations theory, if they are not pitted
against the dominant realists and neo-realists to compete for an
authoritative voice. A discernable challenge is how much impact the
academic, theoretical debates have on policymakers, particularly those
in the foreign and security policy community of great
powers]{.underline}. This is not to say that the theoretical world that
offers a more nuanced approach to international relations has had no
bearing on the real policy world and conducts of great powers. Nor do
the realists, particularly prevalent in the US, only see the world in
the classical balance of military power terms, if only because of the
"discovery" of the utility of power of persuasion, or soft power, as an
effective tool of American diplomacy in winning friends in the Cold War.
But [in mainstream policy discussions about geopolitical competition
between the US and China, there appears little room for
nuance.]{.underline}

*H&RM=Howell and Richter-Montpetit*

Replying, we face a difficult dilemma**[. The methodology and academic
standards of the H&RM piece are so profoundly and systematically flawed
as to void the authors' argument]{.underline}**, [and we think the lack
of credible supporting evidence makes their charge
libellous]{.underline}. To properly demonstrate the depth and extent of
H&RM's errors and misrepresentations requires a full, point-by-point
critique. Yet, during a lengthy correspondence with Security Dialogue,
the editors insisted that if we submitted our critique as a reply it
should comply with the standard length of 4,000 words2 and refused
simultaneous publication with H&RM's article. They claimed to see no
difference between a charge of racism and normal academic disputes about
facts, methods or theories, and therefore no case for amending their
normal practice. They furthermore insisted on reviewing our reply: the
editors want to be judge and jury as well as defendants[**.**
Consequently, we are reluctant to publish this reply in Security
Dialogue at all. Within a 4,000-word limit, we can hardly begin to lay
out the full details of H&RM's poor scholarship, let alone explore the
more general, and very serious, questions this affair raises for the
discipline of international relations and the fight against
racism.]{.underline} There is a case for denying the authors and
Security Dialogue the oxygen of discussion that they seem to hope for in
publishing such toxic and outlandish charges. We decided to offer a
short reply in Security Dialogue only to state our principled views and
to open a portal from the epicentre of the affair to a detailed reply.

What follows addresses only highlights of the catalogue of
methodological and conceptual errors in H&RM's article. **[The full
reply, which interested readers hopefully will consult, leaves almost
nothing of H&RM's argument standing.]{.underline}** [This dispiriting
affair raises important questions for the discipline of international
relations that we can only hint at here but address in our longer
reply]{.underline}: • How can and should international relations take on
structural/systemic racism? • What are criteria for evidence by which
one can identify the inner logic of a theory in order to critique its
foundations? • How well or badly do H&RM reflect the background
literatures they draw upon? • What can securitization theory actually do
and not do when applied to the scourge of racism? • Is racism such a
uniquely damaging force that the academic struggle against it warrants
violating scholarly norms and potentially sacrificing the private and
professional integrity of non-racist colleagues? • What are the
responsibilities of academic journals when confronted with works like
H&RM's article?

[H&RM's article could perhaps best be used as a teaching tool for how
not to make an academic argument]{.underline}. The kind of deepfake
methodology it employs should have no place in academic debates and
should certainly not be published in a reputable journal. The errors
come in various forms of which we can here only give the flavour.

**[If H&RM deem various classical authors (Arendt, Schmitt, Hobbes,
Durkheim, Foucault) racist, then securitization theory, and by
implication the present authors, are also racist for citing
them]{.underline}**. [This destructive tactic is the main basis for
their charge against us of civilizationism]{.underline} (H&RM, 2020:
7--11 \[5--9\]). **[By this standard, it would be hard to find anyone in
international relations who did not qualify as racist.]{.underline}**
Aside from the considerable room for contesting whether some of these
authors (e.g. Arendt) qualify as racist, **[there is the question of
whether tinges of racism, or even wholesale embracing of it, should
disqualify a thinker's work in toto]{.underline}**. [H&RM's mode of
presenting these accusations implies that everybody should ignore in
their entirety the works of key thinkers, both Western and non-Western,
up to 1945, who lived in times when racism was a widely accepted norm in
most societies and who did not go out of their way to contest that
norm.]{.underline} [**This requirement would eliminate most of the
intellectual legacy of the humanities and social sciences.** Do we as a
discipline become better at analysing politics by leaving out references
to Hobbes, because if we cite him our writings become
racist?]{.underline} '**[Don't engage with the tradition. Start anew
every time.' This is the unarticulated argument in H&RM's article. A
presentist and anti-intellectual future looms large.]{.underline}** If
you who are reading this have ever cited anybody who might have been
inspired by someone who can be seen as racist, be prepared for your turn
in the dock.

[H&RM mobilize Foucauldian security studies as a source of authority
against us]{.underline}, **[but their own previous round of
racism-busting was targeted at Foucauldian security
studies]{.underline}** (Howell and RichterMontpetit, 2019). [Now the
scene gets not only absurd but authoritarian]{.underline}. **[You become
a racist if you use any source that H&RM deem to be
racist]{.underline}**. **[They themselves draw on something they deemed
racist in previous work.]{.underline}** [Since they are not
self-labelling as racists, this places interpretative power with the
accuser.]{.underline}

[H&RM write that 'much orthodox and critical Western social and
political thought is predicated upon epistemological and ontological
premises that are not simply Eurocentric but racist, specifically white
supremacist']{.underline} (H&RM, 2020: 4 \[2\]). [Then, H&RM should
explore the entanglement of international relations in this system and
its implications. Instead of analysing securitization theory in relation
to such a systemic understanding, H&RM imitate a close reading of
securitization theory, pretending to make their points from our texts,
while de facto reaching their conclusions from anywhere but our texts
themselves.]{.underline}

### Alternative Fails -- Can't Escape Link

#### Alternative scholarship can't escape dilemma of security focus

Richter-Montpetit's underestimation of the problem, towards situating
security through struggle", Security Dialogue 2021, Vol. 52(S) 69-77,

Howell and Richter-Montpetit seek to extend this important work to
security studies. However, the question is whether security studies
faces specific challenges in addressing its colonial intellectual
foundations, which arise from its very self-definition as a field.
Security has long been 'the supreme concept of bourgeois society'
(Neocleous, 2008: 11). **[The epistemic conditions of even the most
critical scholarship continue to be shaped not only by the neoliberal
academy, with its racialized, class-based and gendered obstacles to
admittance, but also by what we look for when we are part of part of a
'we']{.underline}** (see Foucault, 1984: 385), **[organized around the
problematization of security. Disciplines, after all, revolve around the
problems that they generate - problems that, in their very framing,
imply particular ontological assumptions.]{.underline}**

What is remarkable about critical security studies is that
**[scholars]{.underline}** - particularly those working in a Foucauldian
tradition **[- acknowledge that the liberal preoccupation with security
serves to mask relations of power and violence.]{.underline}** They
acknowledge that it is not 'all about security', **[but still re-centre
security in the very process of calling it into question]{.underline}**.
**[The risk is that the (liberal) identi- fication of normality with
peace and neutrality is reinforced, that an ideological fantasy is
solidi- fied by its constant repetition in practice]{.underline}**
(Coleman and Rosenow, 2016: 214). **[Even when liberal accounts of
politics are subject to critique, starting from a concern with security
(even broadly conceived) can still mean that other relations of violence
fade out of view. The world is, in effect, collapsed into a disciplinary
perspective]{.underline}** (see Gordon, 2011: 99).

*H&RM=Howell and Richter-Montpetit*

This is only a taster of all that is academically flawed about H&RM's
article, and we hope readers will now turn to our longer reply. [H&RM's
sloppy scholarship and thorough misrepresentations of what they attack
discredit both them and Security Dialogue.]{.underline} **[There is no
basis for H&RM's overarching charge of the theory being racist other
than their assertion that all Western social science is systemically
racist. Racism is an accusation that should not be made lightly, because
being branded as racist obviously has severe human and social
costs]{.underline}**. [To accuse peers in the discipline of racism
should be a difficult decision, strongly conditioned by the credibility
of the evidence and the specificity of the charge.]{.underline} **[H&RM
present no politico-academic reasoning explaining their decision to
cross what is usually a clear line for academic debate]{.underline}**.
By publishing the article, Security Dialogue supports this
transgression. H&RM write in a straightforward,
declaratory/authoritative style, as though their article simply presents
'how it really is', not a complex decision involving concerns about
responsibility and effects. [This is doubly puzzling given that our main
texts include explicit ethical and political self-reflections about the
possible value and risks involved in coining concepts and shaping
theories in particular ways]{.underline} (contra H&RM's unfounded
postulate that we present the theory as 'neutral'; see H&RM, 2020: 3,
11, 16 \[1, 9, 14\]).

**[H&RM's article is dangerously counterproductive to the important task
of dealing with systemic racism in international
relations]{.underline}**. [Debasing the currency of academic analysis
will steer the discipline into a post-truth direction antithetical to
its epistemological integrity and social purpose.]{.underline} **[The
power of racism in the world today and its partaking in our discipline
are far too serious to be channelled into polemics against made-up
targets]{.underline}**. **[H&RM water down the meaning of racism so that
it captures practically everyone in social science.]{.underline}**
Having [deemed postcolonial scholarship not radical enough, they have
set up a machine that will judge any theory racist unless it foregrounds
race in their specific jargon of 'methodological whiteness' and
'antiblack racism'**. Any theory not centred on racism in their sense is
racist -- not just more or less capable of analysing racism, but
'racist', 'antiblack' and 'white supremacist'.**]{.underline}
International relations certainly needs to engage the question of racism
-- both as crucial in world politics and as an internal challenge
entrenched within the historical constitution of the discipline -- but
not like this.

We think Security Dialogue should retract the article because **[its
deepfake methodology can be used to 'prove' anything. H&RM's practices,
like falsely attributed quotes and systematic disregard of
countervailing evidence, void their central argument and amount to
serious academic misconduct]{.underline}**. Such flawed work should not
warrant publication in a leading academic journal.
