### Critical Theory Fails

#### Critical theory fails the current political moment -- focusing on understanding structures of oppression without concrete strategies of dissent and change replicate the failure of critical theory without praxis

**Harcourt 18** (Bernard, Prof of Law and Political Science at Columbia,

in Paris, Critique & Praxis: A Pure Theory of Illusions, Values, and
Tactics, and an Answer to the Question: \"What Is To Be Done?\" Open

Another central insight of critical theory is that these [struggles are
fought, and often won,]{.underline} on the basis of illusions: [by
getting people to believe so deeply in the truth of social facts that
they are then willing to sacrifice their lives for their
beliefs]{.underline}. In recent decades, with the collapse of communism
and the rise of neoliberalism, the illusion of free markets has done
most of the work. But today, increasingly, the specter of immigrant
invasion, of loss of white identity, and of the Islamification of the
West are now converting many more people to extreme-right populist
movements.¶ [In times past, critical theory would have had a ready-made
answer to these troubled times]{.underline}. In the late nineteenth and
most of the twentieth centuries, [Marxist thinkers dominated the
critical Left. Traditional critical theory was tethered to class
struggle and historical materialism]{.underline}. **[Critical
practice---what became known as praxis---was oriented toward
revolution]{.underline}**. To be sure, there were internecine conflicts
and rivalries over tactics. The heated debate between Rosa Luxembourg
and Lenin on the question of what was to be done is a good
illustration.1 But the broad outline of the path forward was well
defined: class struggle, international solidarity, and revolutionary
social transformation. This vision of praxis shaped the first generation
of the Frankfurt School and represented a common horizon for the
critical Left in the early to mid-twentieth century.¶ [But with peasant
and anti-colonial insurrections in the East and South at mid-century,
and in the wake of the repression following May 1968, many critical
voices began to fracture the consensus of traditional critical
theory]{.underline}. The decline of syndicalism and of more radical
factions of the international labor movement gradually transformed and
pacified labor movements during the second half of the twentieth century
The events in the 1950s and 60s, especially in Hungary and the East
Bloc, began to unveil some of the illusions of traditional critical
theory itself; as did the streets of 1968 where the vitality of the
student and worker movements slammed against the rigidity of leftist
parties, especially Western communist parties still beholden to the
Soviet Union. At that point, the grip of Marx's philosophy of history
began to loosen. And [once that glue dissolved, the critical
prescriptions got muddied]{.underline}. Since that time, [critical
praxis has lacked its earlier coherence]{.underline}---leaving many
[critical thinkers today somewhat disarmed in the face of renewed
right-wing populism.¶]{.underline} **[There is today no longer an
intelligible critical response to the question "What is to be
done?"]{.underline}** Apart from a dwindling core, few critical
theorists would explicitly advocate the answers that most on the
critical Left would have imagined in the early or mid-twentieth century.
Today, right-wing populist movements have cannibalized segments of the
proletarian base of the former Left, turning old-style class warfare
into anti-immigrant, xenophobic, and ethno-racist conflict. The cleavage
is no longer between the workers and the bourgeoisie, but between a
populist white class versus minorities and immigrants, or children of
immigrants, predominantly of color. In the United States, it is between
destitute whites and impoverished blacks and Latinos. [The problems this
raises are acute]{.underline}.¶ The questions are pressing---but
**[critical theory no longer provides a straightforward
answer]{.underline}**. To the contrary, in recent decades, [critical
theory has been mired in internecine struggles of influence among its
different branches]{.underline}---Marxist, Lacanian, Foucaultian,
deconstructive, feminist, post-colonial, queer---or worse, in tribal
politics and gossip around its illuminati. These [internal wars of
influence and political games have prevented critics from building on
the core of critique and taking on the challenge of elaborating a
contemporary critical theory of practice---a critical praxis for our
critical times]{.underline}.¶ It is time, then, to rejuvenate critical
theory and critical praxis for the twenty-first century. In these pages,
I will set forth a new vision for critical theory and praxis, and answer
the specific question of what is to be done today, here, and now. In
brief, I will propose that we understand critical theory, at its core,
as a pure theory of illusions that calls for a pure theory of values and
entails a pure theory of tactics. Let me prefigure the argument as
succinctly as possible.¶ [Critical theory is the constant endless
unveiling of illusions in order to demonstrate the distributional
consequences of our belief systems, material conditions, and political
economies. It traces the effects in reality of our beliefs and material
practice]{.underline}s, recognizing that, as it unveils illusions, it
creates new ones that will need to be unpacked next. [It is relentless
in this way---this is its anti-foundational basis. It engages in a form
of recursive unmasking---an infinite regress]{.underline}---that
endlessly exposes the distributional effects of belief systems and
material conditions. It entails, in this sense, a pure theory of
illusions.¶ In the same way in which reconstructed critical theory,
understood as a pure theory of illusions, liberates us from unfounded
positivist foundations, it also frees us from the foundational
constraints of traditional critical utopias. **[There is no unique form
of political economy that will satisfy a critical utopian
vision.]{.underline}** All political economic regimes are regulated in
unique ways and produce material distributions that are the direct
effect of the specific rules and regulations of that particular regime,
not of the abstract regime type. A state-controlled economy can
distribute to its apparatschik, just as a privately-owned corporation
can distribute to its workers: it is not the type, but the detailed
mechanisms and regulations of the specific regime that shape the social
order. All that we can judge, as critical theorists, is how close a
specific regime approximates the values and ideals that the critical
tradition shares. In this sense, critical theory calls for judgment
about the values that a political economic regime instantiates through
its material outcomes and distributions, not for a particular political
economy. Hand-in-hand with a pure theory of illusions, [reconstructed
critical theory must be agnostic about the form of political economic
regime, but adamant about its values]{.underline}. It entails, in this
sense, a pure theory of values.¶ [In terms of praxis, then,
reconstructed critical theory calls for entirely situated,
contextualized analyses of how to push specific, really-existing,
situated political economic regimes]{.underline}---whether capitalist,
socialist, or communist---in the proper direction. Each historical,
temporal, and geopolitical situation will differ, calling for different
tactics---with nothing off the table. This is an inherently combative
enterprise because critical theorists are necessarily opposing and
confronting the values and material projects of others**[. Politics is a
constant battle over values, and we are all inevitably in a state of
competition to realize our ideals. In such a contested space, it is only
possible to develop tactics in a situated and contextualized way. Since
there is no war to be won, but an endless series of battles, critical
theory must focus on tactics]{.underline}**. These are not portable or
generalizable. What might have been appropriate in 1930s Germany was
completely different than what worked in 1940s India. In the latter
context, non-violent resistance may have been appropriate; in the former
it would have been useless. Battle tactics cannot be universalized. In
this sense, reconstructed critical theory calls for a pure theory of
tactics.¶ The upshot is that there is no single or abstract answer to
the question "What is to be done?" In the same way in which
reconstructed critical theory overcomes unfounded positivist
foundations, the question "What is to be done?" does not have a unique
or correct answer in the abstract. The answer is not a vanguard party, a
leaderless movement, non-violent resistance, or any general mode of
uprising, in the abstract. There is no one right way to proceed in
general terms. We immediately go off track when we seek one
generalizable answer to the question. Instead, the question must be
answered differently for each situation, specified and contextualized in
space and time. There must be a GPS-, time-, and date-stamp to every
answer.¶ In this book, I propose one such time, place, and date stamped
answer to the question: "What is to be done in the United States on
September 1, 2018?" That is the only style of question that is worth a
critical response. I hope that others will answer the question with
their own time, place, and date stamp wherever they are now---and I will
facilitate a forum to post those answers. **[Critical theory cannot
simply understand our crises and unveil our illusions. It cannot content
itself with reflection or contemplation as a form of practice. It must
articulate tactics and praxis]{.underline}**.¶ [Critical times call for
radical revaluation. Earlier similar epochs were foundational moments
for critical theory and praxis]{.underline}. The 1920s, especially in
the Weimar Republic, gave rise to a whole generation of critical
theorists---many of whom would emigrate in exile around the world and
spawn a critical diaspora.2 The 1960s, with its global student uprisings
and government repression, stimulated another wave of critical theory
and praxis, giving way to a formidable decade of critical thought during
the 1970s. [Our critical times today demand an equal response from
contemporary critical theorists. That is what I propose here: a new
vision for critical theory and critical praxis for the twenty-first
century.]{.underline}

### Genealogy Fails

#### Genealogy offers no method of diagnosing the specific mechanisms by which power operates or concrete praxis for people to realize their emancipation from those structures

**Lewandowski 94** \[Associate Professor and Philosophy Program
Coordinator at The University of Central Missouri Philosophy and Social
Criticism, "Heidegger, literary theory and social criticism," Philosophy
Social Criticism.1994; 20: 109-122, GDI-JCR\]

[Genealogy, in its ostensible analyses of the 'historical specificity of
modern power relations']{.underline}, misses 'the ultimate
ontotheological origins of panopticism or the regime of truth;' (p.
174). Insofar as Heidegger's destruction emphasized the ontological
construction of modernity (its philosophical ground) it was, as we have
seen, a limited agency of critical practice. But insofar as Foucault
(and other contemporary worldly critics) emphasizes its sociopolitical
construction (its scientific/technological ground), his genealogy too
[constitutes a limited agency of critique]{.underline}\.... A dialogue
between their discourses will show that the overdetermined sciences and
the 'residual' humanities \... are, in fact, different instruments of
the anthropo-logos, the discourse of Man, and thus complicitous in the
late capitalist West's neoimperial project of planetary domination. (p.
152) In [this thinking]{.underline} Heidegger with Foucault, and in a
'dialogue between their discourses', Spanos thinks he has the necessary
grounding for a structured theory of social relations with critical
intent, a kind of theory that American literary [theory]{.underline},
from Brooks to de Man, [has been unable (or unwilling) to
articulate]{.underline}, and a kind of theory neither Heidegger nor
Foucault adequately articulated. Heidegger shares many of the problems
that faced an earlier generation of critical theorists interested in
Heidegger (here I am thinking of Marcuse), and many of the problems that
face contemporary philosophical hermeneutics (here I am thinking mostly
of Gadamer and Vattimo). Remember that Marcuse's dissatisfaction with
Heidegger grew, in fact, not simply out of Heidegger's political
engagements but more so out of his failure to link his fundamental
ontology to [any historically concretized praxis]{.underline} (a problem
Spanos is aware of, as I suggested earlier, but never resolves via
[genealogy]{.underline} - a point I shall return to shortly). Heidegger
[never has much to say about agents and their capacity for historically
realizable emancipation]{.underline}: for Heidegger, it is always a
freedom that possesses man, a historical destiny that awaits or calls
us, and not the other way around. Thomas McCarthy raises this
problematic in his essay on 'Heidegger and Critical Theory': Heidegger,
Marcuse wrote, 'remained content to talk of the nation's link with
destiny, of the 'heritage' that each individual has to take over, and of
the community of the 'generation', while other dimensions of facticity
were treated under such categories as 'they' and 'idle talk' and
relegated in this way to inauthentic existence. \[He\] did not go on to
ask about the nature of this heritage, about the people's mode of being,
about the real processes and forces that are history.' (p. 96) The point
to be made here is that Heidegger's politics are not the only (or
necessarily the largest) obstacle to coupling him with critical theory.
Hence much of Spanos's energetic defense of Heidegger against his
'humanist detractors' (particularly in his defiant concluding chapter,
'Heidegger, Nazism, and the 'Repressive Hypothesis': The American
Appropriation of the Question') is misdirected. For as McCarthy rightly
points out, 'the basic issues separating critical theory from
Heideggerean ontology were not raised post hoc in reaction to
Heidegger's political misdeeds but were there from the start. Marcuse
formulated them in all clarity during his time in Freiburg, when he was
still inspired by the idea of a materialist analytic of Dasein' (p. 96,
emphasis added). In other words, Heidegger succumbs quite readily to an
immanent critique. Heidegger's aporias are not simply the result of his
politics but rather stem from the internal limits of his questioning of
the 'being that lets beings be', truth as disclosure, and destruction of
the metaphysical tradition, all of which divorce reflection from social
practice and thus lack critical perspective. Spanos, however, thinks
Foucault can provide an alternative materialist grounding for an
emancipatory critical theory that would obviate the objections of
someone such as Marcuse. But [the turn to Foucault is]{.underline} no
less [problematic]{.underline} than the original turn to Heidegger.
[Genealogy is not critical in any real way.]{.underline} Nor can it tame
or augment what Spanos calls Heidegger's 'overdetermination of the
ontological site'. Foucault's [analysis of power, despite its
originality, is an ontology of power and not]{.underline}, as Spanos
thinks, [a 'concrete diagnosis']{.underline} (p.138) of [power
mechanisms.]{.underline}3 Thus it dramatizes, on a different level, the
same shortcomings of Heidegger's fundamental ontology. The 'affiliative
relationship' (p. 138) that Spanos tries to develop between Heidegger
and Foucault in order to avoid the problem Marcuse faced simply cannot
work. Where Heidegger ontologizes Being, [Foucault]{.underline}
ontologizes power. The latter [sees power as a strategic and intentional
but subjectless mechanism that 'endows itself' and punches out 'docile
bodies']{.underline}, whereas the former sees Being as that neutered
term and no-thing that calls us.
