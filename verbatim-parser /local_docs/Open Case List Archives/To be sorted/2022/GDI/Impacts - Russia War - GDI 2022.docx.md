T[he West's sanctions against Moscow, even as they take a toll on the
global economy, have so far failed]{.underline} to have the intended
effect in Russia. [Because of the soaring price of crude, Russia
continues to enjoy ample oil revenues]{.underline}. And even though the
[value of the ruble]{.underline} plunged when Russia launched its
invasion in February, it [has rebounded and recently hit a seven-year
high against the dollar]{.underline}. The United States and its G-7
partners agreed earlier this week to pursue further measures to restrict
trade with Russia and also discussed putting a price cap on purchases of
Russian oil to ease inflationary pressures and lower Russia's revenues.
[The potential impact of these next steps remains
uncertain]{.underline}.

Yes, [the West must stand by Ukraine, punish Russian expansionism, and
defend against further acts of aggression]{.underline}. [But it also
needs to weigh these priorities against the imperative of preventing
illiberal populists from taking power on both sides of the
Atlantic]{.underline}. The price of gas in Ohio or Bavaria seems of
trivial relevance against the backdrop of Ukraine's valiant fight for
its freedom. [But managing the war in Ukraine also means navigating the
dangerous shoals of American and European politics]{.underline}.
[Ukraine would certainly not be the beneficiary should "America first"
Republicans come to power in the United States or pro-Moscow populists
gain ground in Europe.]{.underline}

[It would indeed be cruel irony if NATO succeeds in helping Kyiv thwart
Putin's predatory ambition only to see the Atlantic democracies fall
prey to threats from within]{.underline}. Even as they send more
howitzers and drones to Ukraine, [NATO leaders need to pay close
attention to the economic and political blowback from the war on their
own societies]{.underline}. When they do so, they will better appreciate
the need to facilitate a cease-fire and support Ukraine's cause at the
negotiating table.

[Moving from war to negotiations, of course, does not offer a quick fix
to the economic dislocations produced by the conflict]{.underline};
sanctions against Russia could well remain in place for quite some time.
But [diplomacy ultimately offers the only pathway to easing the
geopolitical tensions that continue to disrupt energy and food supplies
and contribute to inflationary pressures.]{.underline}

EUROPE'S GRAY ZONE

[NATO members]{.underline} will have their hands full dealing with the
war in Ukraine, managing fraught relations with Russia, reinforcing the
alliance's eastern flank, and after the fighting ends, participating in
post-conflict reconstruction. But they [must also begin looking beyond
the war and its immediate consequences to draw broader
lessons.]{.underline}

[The conflict in Ukraine has made clear the need for fresh thinking
about advancing security in Europe's "gray zone," the lands between NATO
and Russia.]{.underline} Even as the war grinds on, a constructive
conversation is emerging over Ukraine's potential geopolitical status
moving forward. How this issue evolves may provide a model for Georgia,
Moldova, and other countries that have been looking to the West but may
not be destined for NATO membership now that Russia has thrown down the
gauntlet in Ukraine.

[Three intertwined approaches are taking shape to advance the security
needs of countries in Europe's gray zone. First, permanent neutrality
offers these states a means of strengthening their sovereignty and
independence while taking into consideration Russia's objections to the
further eastward enlargement of NATO.]{.underline} Ukraine embraced
neutrality after it separated from the Soviet Union in 1991. It was not
until 2019, in response to Russia's 2014 land grab in Crimea and the
Donbas, that Ukraine enshrined in its constitution its intention to join
NATO. According to Putin, the prospect of Ukraine's membership in the
alliance played a role in his decision to invade again. In his February
24 address to the nation justifying the "special military operation,"
Putin pointed to "the fundamental threats which irresponsible Western
politicians created for Russia. . . . I am referring to the eastward
expansion of NATO, which is moving its military infrastructure ever
closer to the Russian border." During the early weeks of the war, Kyiv
seemed ready to embrace a return to neutrality. Should that outcome
emerge as part of a negotiated settlement to the war, Ukraine's
neutrality may serve as model for the region.

[Second, neutrality would be accompanied by security assurances from a
coalition of willing countries.]{.underline} [Such assurances would fall
short of the formal defense guarantees that would accompany NATO
membership]{.underline}, but they [would commit signatories to help
maintain the security and nonaligned status of countries in Europe's
gray zone.]{.underline} [These arrangements]{.underline} would go beyond
previous levels of Western support, likely [entailing additional
military training and arms transfers during peacetime and robust
military support should the states enjoying such assurances face
atta]{.underline}ck. Ukraine again serves as a good model. NATO members
are not sending troops to Ukraine to join the fight, but they are
providing Ukraine with the wherewithal to defend itself. [When the war
ends, Ukraine could well find itself in a state of armed neutrality,
with ongoing economic and military support from NATO members
strengthening its hand in the negotiations over territory that may well
follow a cease-fire]{.underline}.

[The third plank of security in the gray zone would be membership in the
EU]{.underline}. Brussels has already granted Ukraine and Moldova
candidate status, while Georgia is in the waiting room. [Although
accession negotiations can take a decade or perhaps longer, candidate
status provides aspirants a political shot in the arm and gives their
governments the leverage they need to tackle corruption and implement
onerous economic and political reform]{.underline}s---key steps that
Ukraine needs to take to extract itself from the oligarchic legacy of
its past. [EU membership would eventually mark formal institutional
inclusion in the community of Atlantic democracies, while avoiding the
provocation of Russia that would come with membership in
NATO.]{.underline} As Putin put it recently when confronted with the
prospect of Ukrainian entry into the EU, "We have nothing against it.
It's their sovereign decision to join economic unions or not. . . . It's
their business, the business of the Ukrainian people."

[In this scenario, NATO would take in Finland and Sweden, and the
alliance would eventually integrate aspirants in the Balkans. But it
would go no further]{.underline}. [Setting a transparent limit on NATO's
eastward enlargement and instead looking to the EU to extend its reach
into Europe's gray zone may finally enable the West and Russia to set
aside an issue that has bedeviled their relationship since NATO
enlargement began soon after the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. Even
if Putin has used NATO expansion as a pretext for his land grabs,
[greater clarity on NATO's future could help dampen rivalry between
Russia and the West.]{.underline}

## Answer to Answer Blocks 

### AT Russia not a threat -- poor Ukraine performance 

#### Russia poses threat -- military capabilities and revanchist threat

Given Russia's poor initial showing during its 2022 assault on Ukraine,
some may believe that Russia is weaker than expected, that its strength
will be sapped by the war, and that stronger European defense is
therefore not needed. This would be a dangerous conclusion. Despite
Moscow's missteps, the Russian military will be able to reconstitute its
losses quickly and learn from its mistakes. Russian military
capabilities remain formidable, and Moscow has demonstrated repeatedly
its intent not only to intervene militarily in other countries but to
weaponize food, energy, digital, and other flows connecting it to
various countries. Russia's ongoing revanchist threat, and the more
robust forward presence of allied forces being prepared for approval at
NATO's June 29-30 Madrid summit, will place increasing demands on all
allies for high-readiness forces. This will add to the urgency of
European allies assuming a greater share of the burden across the board
--- greater numbers of forces, higher readiness, and enhanced mobility,
all with critical enablers.

# Nuclear war Impacts

### Nuclear war bad -- laundry list 

#### [Impact]{.underline} -- nuclear war causes little ice age that spreads globally and for centuries -- crop failure, marine death that collapse oceans creating marine famine 

**WILKINS**, staff writer for Common Dreams, **2022**

(BRETT, \"Model Shows Nuclear War Would Cause Millennia-Long \'Little
Ice Age\',\" Common Dreams, July 8, 2022,
https://www.commondreams.org/news/2022/07/08/model-shows-nuclear-war-would-cause-millennia-long-little-ice-age,

As Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine revives the terrifying specter of
thermonuclear annihilation, a scientific study published Thursday
revealed that [a nuclear exchange involving as few as hundreds of
warheads would likely cause a]{.underline} \"[little ice
age]{.underline}\" [lasting centuries or even millennia]{.underline}.

[Scientists have long known that even a \"limited\" thermonuclear
war]{.underline} could [result in]{.underline} a so-called nuclear
winter, or [prolonged global cooling]{.underline}
[resulting]{.underline} from atmospheric [soot]{.underline} [blocking
life-sustaining sunlight]{.underline}. However, [the new study examines
the effects of such warfare on the Earth\'s oceans and marine
ecosystems.]{.underline}

[Researchers simulated two hypothetical nuclear wars]{.underline}: [a
U.S.-Russia thermonuclear exchange]{.underline} in which 4,400
100-kiloton warheads were launched against cities and industrial
targets, sparking conflagrations that spewed more than 330 billion
pounds of smoke and sunlight-absorbing black carbon into the Earth\'s
upper atmosphere, [and an India-Pakistan conflict]{.underline} involving
500 100-kiloton bombs that produced up to 103 billion pounds of smoke.

In all of the researchers\' simulations, [nuclear
firestorms]{.underline} spewed soot and smoke into the upper atmosphere,
[blocking out the sun and resulting in global crop failure]{.underline}.
In the first month after the war, [average global temperatures
plunged]{.underline} by about 13°F, [a larger temperature change than
during the last ice age]{.underline}.

[\"It doesn\'t matter who is bombing whom.]{.underline} It can be India
and Pakistan or NATO and Russia. [Once the smoke is released into the
upper atmosphere, it spreads globally and affects
everyone]{.underline},\" Louisiana State University professor Cheryl
[Harrison]{.underline}, the study\'s lead author,
[explained]{.underline}.

The [researchers found]{.underline} [that ocean temperatures would
quickly and irreversibly plummet, with spreading sea ice causing
catastrophic coastal blockages]{.underline} that would render shipping
impossible in much of the world.

In an even more ominous development, \"[the sudden drop in light and
ocean temperatures]{.underline}, especially from the Arctic to the North
Atlantic and North Pacific oceans, [would kill the marine
algae]{.underline}, [which is the foundation of the marine food
web]{.underline}, essentially [creating a famine in the
ocean]{.underline},\" [a summary]{.underline} of the report published in
Science Daily [stated]{.underline}. \"T[his would halt most fishing and
aquaculture]{.underline}.\"

Study co-author Alan [Robock]{.underline}, a professor of environmental
sciences at Rutgers University in New Jersey, [said]{.underline} that
\"[nuclear warfare results in dire consequences for
everyone]{.underline}.\"

\"World leaders have used our studies previously as an impetus to end
the nuclear arms race in the 1980s, and five years ago to pass a treaty
in the United Nations to ban nuclear weapons,\" he added. \"We hope that
this new study will encourage more nations to ratify the ban treaty.\"

The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) has been
ratified by 65 nations---but none of the world\'s nine nuclear powers.
Commenting after last month\'s first meeting of state parties to the
TPNW in Vienna, disarmament campaigner Alice Slater told InDepthNews
that \"the dark clouds of war and strife continue to plague the world.\"

### Nuclear war bad -- marine food chains

#### Nuclear war causes little ice age and collapses marine food chains and fishing stocks -- adaptation limited possibility

\*NPP = net primary production

\*hysteresis = phenomenon in which the value of a physical property lags
behind changes in the effect causing it,

[For Arctic sea ice]{.underline}, the [hysteresis]{.underline} [does not
just result in a long transient but is likely a new steady state for
many nuclear cooling scenarios]{.underline}, as in historical global
cooling events. While only the US-Russia scenario was simulated long
enough to achieve a steady sea-ice state, [it is likely that sea ice
volume would remain elevated in]{.underline} the four [nuclear
war]{.underline} simulations above 5 Tg, given their elevated state at
the end of the cooling event (Figure  5). Similar elevated sea ice
events are observed in the paleoclimate record after volcanic cooling
events. For example, strong evidence supports that an expanded Arctic
sea ice state during the Little Ice Age (LIA) was triggered by volcanic
forcing within the range of the scenarios here. Decadal scale cooling,
driven by tropical volcanic eruptions, has been simulated to induce an
albedo feedback (Perovich & Polashenski, 2012) that causes centennial
scale increases in Arctic sea ice during the LIA (Zhong et al., 2011), a
finding supported by a range of proxy records across the Arctic (Miller
et al., 2012). Climate proxy records (Sigl et al., 2015) indicate that
the reduction in solar forcing of the largest pre-LIA volcanic eruption
was 35 W/m2 , a small fraction of the 120 W/m2 reduction in our
US-Russia nuclear winter simulation, and similar to the 16 Tg
India-Pakistan case (Coupe et al., 2021). Thus, [both]{.underline} the
[short-term and persistent expanded sea ice seen in simulations of
nuclear war driven cooling is consistent with historical
evidence]{.underline}. We conclude that [a large nuclear war would
likely induce a nuclear little ice age and be more likely to induce such
an event than a volcanic eruption with the same radiation
anomaly]{.underline}, due to the shorter lifetime of volcanic aerosols
and thus briefer cooling duration (Robock, 2000). Anthropogenic climate
change, which was not simulated here, would mitigate some cooling and
the resulting ice expansion (Bethke et al., 2017). [However, for a large
nuclear war anthropogenic CO2 emissions would likely plummet, eventually
slowing or even reversing global warming]{.underline} (Matthews &
Weaver, 2010; Robock, 2015).

How would the immediate and long-term impacts of nuclear cooling affect
marine ecosystems and fisheries? The [large and rapid changes in marine
primary production, temperature and other physical conditions would
result in declines in marine consumers]{.underline} like fish, shellfish
and larger bodied animals, both warm and cold blooded (Guiet
et al., 2016; Heneghan et al., 2021; Jennings et al., 2008;
Schwartz, 1978). The [overall abundance of consumers]{.underline} (i.e.,
fish) [and]{.underline} the [presence of large-bodied species is
directly]{.underline} [related to the magnitude of primary
production]{.underline} (e.g., Guiet et  al.,  2016; Jennings et  al., 
2008), especially for non-mobile species (Watson et  al.,  2015), [and
lower ocean temperatures slow the growth rates of fish]{.underline}
(Brown et al., 2004). Our recent modeling using a global fisheries model
forced by these simulations found that [global fish biomass would
decline]{.underline} by ∼20% [over]{.underline} [the]{.underline} first
10 [years after the]{.underline} US-Russia [war scenario]{.underline},
proportional to declines in primary production, but also depending
strongly on response of fishing pressure after the war (Scherrer
et al., 2020). These estimates have high uncertainty (Scherrer
et al., 2020), as the fisheries model assumes immediate adaptation of
marine communities to rapid climate velocities, and does not resolve
species level processes such as how changes in plankton bloom timing
would affect feeding and reproduction success of zooplankton and fish,
or how light reductions affect visual hunting (Aksnes et al., 2004;
Cahill et al., 2013; Durant et al., 2007; Pinsky et al., 2020).

[Given]{.underline} the [large uncertainties and limited modeling
performed for marine consumers]{.underline}, [it is highly uncertain
what the upper trophic level communities would look like in the new
ocean state]{.underline}. Global marine ecosystem models generally
simulate functional groups or fish size spectra and not individual
species (Heneghan et al., 2021), and the explicit links between the
changes in the composition of phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish
communities need to be investigated further. While there is evidence
that some pelagic fish species rapidly shifted geographic range and
adapted to the climatic perturbation following the Tambora volcanic
eruption (Alexander et al., 2017), we underline that [most of the war
scenarios modeled here cause much larger and more sustained climate
anomalies]{.underline}. [Temperature impacts from nuclear war are
particularly extreme in coastal regions where the majority of fish catch
and marine ecosystem services are provided]{.underline} (Figure 3c).
Benthic and sessile marine organisms in coastal zones would be
particularly vulnerable to the locally extreme temperature and NPP
shifts (Figures 2 and 6). [The long-term thermal tolerance of many
species and life history stages would likely be exceeded by the
velocity, magnitude and duration of the nuclear war driven climate
event, leading to decreased fitness and increased mortality]{.underline}
(Peck et al., 2009; Rezende et al., 2011). Thus, the [strong declines in
temperature and primary productivity projected in many of the nuclear
war scenarios could lead to collapses of marine food-chains and
potentially extinctions of some endemic marine consumers]{.underline}.
[The timescale of recovery to such disturbances is unclear]{.underline}.

### 1nc/2ac -- nuke war -- oceans

#### Nuclear war massively alters ocean ecosystems -- even if improves nutrients in one area, overall impact on ice sheets and stocks harmful 

**Harrison et al.**, assisstant prof at LSU, **2022**

(Cheryl S., \"A New Ocean State After Nuclear War,\" AGU Advances,
Volume3, Issue 4, e2021AV000610, August 2022,

\*hysteresis = property of a system that has a response that "lags
behind" the forcing variable, meaning that the system depends on the
history of the forcing, either resulting in a new state when forcing is
removed, or slowly returns to the initial state

\*NPP = net primary production

[Following]{.underline} each of the [nuclear war]{.underline} scenarios,
[a decadal solar radiation reduction and cooling event
ensues]{.underline}. The [low light and rapid]{.underline}, [sustained
cooling cause large physical perturbations to the ocean]{.underline},
[including]{.underline} an [intensification of vertical mixing, enhanced
overturning and expansion of sea ice]{.underline}. In all nuclear war
scenarios, [these perturbations drive a hysteresis]{.underline},
[generating]{.underline} [a new ocean]{.underline} [state]{.underline},
[where density stratification and biogeochemical tracers are altered
throughout the water column]{.underline}. The [magnitude of the new
state and timescale of recovery are affected by the magnitude of the
cooling anomaly and depend on the system effected]{.underline}. In all
nuclear war scenarios, [modifications to temperature and biogeochemical
profiles persist for]{.underline} many decades, and [likely hundreds of
years]{.underline}, [owing]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [the long
recovery timescales of the deep ocean]{.underline}. Increased Arctic sea
ice extent and volume are likely permanent in US-Russia (150 Tg) war
simulation, as in the case of the volcanic cooling driven initiation of
the Little Ice Age at the end of the thirteenth Century CE. Increased
macronutrient availability, driven by changes in biogeochemical
profiles, boosts marine productivity in the tropics and subtropics
during nuclear cooling, and even more once nuclear cooling ends.
However, [increased iron limitation at high latitudes due to an altered
phytoplankton community results in no enhancement of production there,
despite the higher nitrate]{.underline}. Enhanced tropical productivity
in the US-Russia scenario leads to an increase in global NPP that
persists for decades. These [results indicate major changes in ocean
ecosystems after a global cooling event]{.underline}, [both]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} the [nuclear]{.underline} [cooling]{.underline} event
itself, [but also]{.underline} from [long-term changes to the marine
physical and biogeochemical system]{.underline}. These findings expand
our understanding of how both historical and potential future global
cooling events impact ocean physics, biogeochemistry, and ecosystems.
