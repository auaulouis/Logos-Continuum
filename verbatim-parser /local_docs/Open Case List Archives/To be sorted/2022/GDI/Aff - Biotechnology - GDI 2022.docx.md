[While [synthetic biology]{.mark} heralds advances in these felds, its
techniques [could]{.mark} also [be adapted for malicious
purposes]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and used by terrorist organizations,
rogue actors]{.mark}, or hostile nations to create dangerous pathogens,
invasive organisms, or other disruptive biological agents]{.underline}
(Yeh et al. 2012). [Such potential makes synthetic biology a dual-use
research area of concern]{.underline} (DURC) [since [the same techniques
can be used to **benefit or harm**]{.mark} people, animals,
environments, or nations]{.underline} (Getz and Dellaire 2018). Indeed,
there have been 35 confrmed cases of biological weapons deployment
between 1970 and 2014 (Franconi et al. 2018). Thus far, [the use of
advanced [biotechnologies]{.mark} for weapons production has mostly been
pursued by state-actors. However, synthetic biological weapons [are
expected to become a larger concern as the field advances and they
become increasingly adopted by malicious sub-state or non-state
actors]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gronvall 2018[). Synthetic biology raises
the possibility that **[pathogenic bioweapons could be
designed]{.mark}**, developed, and deployed in new ways that diverge
from the disease causing characteristics of naturally occurring
pathogens]{.underline} (NAS 2018). Traditionally, only known pathogens
found naturally in the environment, such as B. anthracis and Y. pestis,
were developed as biological weapons because of the inherent infectious
characteristics that readily enabled such organisms to serve as weapons.
However, as synthetic biology continues to expand its capabilities to
create and modify biological weapons, there is an increasing need for
biosafety and biosecurity assurances for humans, animals, plants, and
the environment. [[To cope with threats]{.mark} arising from synthetic
biology's dual-use nature, [**biosecurity is needed** to prevent,
detect, and determine the source of biological
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Biological weapons created from synthetic
biology represent a new and unique threat space. Potential threats from
synthetic biology include increased pathogen transmissibility between
and within species in addition to resistance to established treatments.
Synthetic biology can be used to engineer normally benign microbes that
produce toxic biological compounds or re-build extinct or hard-to-obtain
pathogens from scratch (NAS 2018). [The main biotechnologies of concern
in the near future]{.underline} (over the course of the next decade or
so) are projected to be oligonucleotide synthesis, DNA assembly
(assembling multiple smaller fragments of oligonucleotides into the
desired larger sequence), and genetic modifcation (editing, deleting,
and inserting desired sequences into targeted sites of a genome). Harm
may also arise through the purposeful use of these techniques to disrupt
human and environmental systems. Malevolent use, but also negligent use
(misuse) of synthetic biology techniques, require two circumstances: (a)
the spread of information, techniques, or knowhow to utilize synthetic
biology's enabling technologies for irresponsible or nefarious purposes
("information hazard"), and (b) the ability to use such knowledge and
tools to generate and disseminate harmful engineered organisms to
vulnerable recipients. [Creating **effective [biosecurity]{.mark}
procedures and [policies]{.mark}** to [protect humans]{.mark},
agriculture, technology, [and the environment from]{.mark} such
[nefarious usages (or accidental or negligent]{.mark} damage from
[misuse) will require **understanding** the current state of synthetic
biology]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Bioterrorism threatens extinction

**Warrel '21**, (Helen Warrell is a Defense and Security Editor at the
Financial Times. She specializes in research of Business and Finance,
Education, Politics. "Laboratory viruses pose 'existential threat',
warns bioweapons expert" (Mar 6, 2021) -- Accessed on 6-25-22)
<https://www.proquest.com/docview/2508509195?pq-origsite=primo> \[AO\]

Laboratories working on novel viruses and other [[dangerous pathogens
must be]{.underline}]{.mark} more tightly [[controlled to prevent
**accidents** or **terrorism**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[causing]{.underline}]{.mark} another pandemic, a leading
**[[bioweapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** expert has warned. "I think **[[we
need to see biological hazards as an existential threat to the 21st
century]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the same way that atomic science was
to the 20th century," said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon the former commander
of the UK's Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear regiment.
Covid-19 has highlighted the threat caused by highly-infectious viruses,
many of which are being studied or stored in facilities around the world
with inadequate security protocols, de Bretton-Gordon told the Financial
Times. While chemical facilities are closely monitored by the
Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, there is no such
designated body to police biological labs. "The biological weapons
convention says you should adhere to these rules, you should follow
these guidelines and if there\'s an accident, you should report it, but
people have only paid lip service to that," said de Bretton-Gordon, who
led the British army's responses to anthrax, sarin and chlorine gas
attacks in Iraq and Syria, and also commanded Nato's Rapid Reaction CBRN
battalion. "[[The opportunity for theft, accident or leakage is
high]{.mark}. Now that we've seen how quickly a pathogen can spread . .
. we need our security to be absolutely watertight]{.underline}." The
former commander's security warnings come as a World Health Organisation
team investigating the origins of the pandemic has returned from China's
Wuhan Institute of Virology. The lab had been conducting experiments on
bat coronaviruses in 2019 and quickly became the focus of theories that
the novel coronavirus could have been released via a leak. De
Bretton-Gordon said although this scenario was unlikely, the coronavirus
pandemic has demonstrated the dangers that a lab breach would pose. The
most dangerous pathogens such as Anthrax and Ebola are kept in maximum
containment Bio Security Level 4 labs, of which there are nearly 50
around the world according to a 2017 WHO study, although this list is
now out of date. These include the Wuhan facility and the UK's Defence
Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down. BSL-4 labs are usually
subject to high national security regulations and WHO biosecurity
guidelines, but [[standards are not enforced or monitored at an
international level]{.underline}]{.mark}. The only mandatory inspections
occur at the two labs which contain the last remaining stocks of the
smallpox virus: Russia's Vector Institute in Siberia, and the US Center
for Disease Control in Georgia. Those facilities are visited every two
years by the WHO to ensure safe storage and research procedures. Even
before the pandemic, there were concerns that safety standards at BSL-4
labs were not universally observed. US diplomats who visited the Wuhan
Institute of Virology in 2018 warned of a "serious shortage of
appropriately-trained technicians and investigators needed to safely
operate this high-containment laboratory," according to diplomatic
cables seen by the Washington Post. Professor Gregory Koblentz, a
biodefence expert at George Mason University in Virginia, said the WHO's
difficulties in establishing basic facts about safety and security at
the Wuhan Institute for Virology "indicates that we do not have
sufficient oversight over these facilities and the activities happening
inside them". "In the next couple of years there will definitely be more
countries building BSL-4 labs," he added. "So we need to be more
proactive and develop better oversight now to prevent this increased
research \[on viruses\] resulting in more accidents or reckless
behaviour that could cause an outbreak that's entirely avoidable."
Pathogens such as influenza and botulinum are usually kept at lower
security in BSL-3 labs, which are subject to varying national
guidelines. There are no official estimates of how many such **[[labs
exist around the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though the figure is
expected to be [[well over]{.underline} **[3,000]{.underline}**]{.mark},
according to de Bretton-Gordon. Koblentz is working with Dr Filippa
Lentzos, an expert in biological threats at King\'s College London, to
compile an unofficial database of BSL-4 labs which they will present at
the World Health Assembly in May. The pair hope to extend the project to
cover BSL-3 labs too. The WHO told the FT it took the issue of lab
biosecurity "very seriously" and that it was "aware of the growing
demand and interest in BSL-4 labs". "In principle, all existing BSL-4 or
similar facilities are under the strict oversight of respective national
regulatory bodies," it said. "Whether or not there is a need for an
additional international or overarching regulatory framework is a matter
for WHO member states to discuss." De Bretton-Gordon served for 23 years
in the British army, spending over a decade focused on chemical and
biological attacks. He described biological weapons as "morbidly
brilliant" because of their effectiveness and the fear they induce,
adding that virus outbreaks [[in recent years]{.underline}]{.mark} had
focused the minds of security officials. Ben Wallace, UK defence
secretary, warned last month that [[there was a "growing threat of
chemical or biological \[attack\]" around the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}, and said the availability of information on
**[[the internet had provided a "turbo boost" for bad actors seeking to
research these weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. At the height of the
2014-16 Ebola crisis, de Bretton-Gordon said he had provided advice to
the US security services over concerns that terrorists would
intentionally infect a suicide bomber with the virus before detonating
explosives in a confined space such as the subway. At the same time,
advances in synthetic biology have created new engineered pathogens,
which he feared could also be put to malevolent use. "Perhaps, before
December 2019, the focus of security services was elsewhere," he said.
"I\'m pretty certain they're taking this matter extremely seriously
now."

#### Biotech leadership deters bioweapon development and use -- allied coop creates consistency and prevents theft

Scott **Moore '21**, February 17, a lecturer in political science at the
University of Pennsylvania and previously served at the U.S. Department
of State, where he worked on the Paris Agreement, "In Biotech, the
Industry of the Future, the U.S. Is Way Ahead of China," LAWFARE,
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-024-2086-9.pdf

[[Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark} is such a critical area for technological
competition between the U.S. and China because it [[is
transforming]{.mark} fields from medicine to [military
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. The great advances of the 19th century, like
chemical fertilizers, resulted from mastering chemistry. In the 20th
century, mastery of physics led to nuclear energy---and, more ominously,
nuclear weapons. [In the 21st century, [biology offers]{.mark} a similar
mix of [peril and promise]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was illustrated
dramatically by the award of the 2020 Nobel Prize for the discovery of
an enzyme system known as CRISPR-Cas9, which allows an organism's
genomes to be edited with high precision. It is a transformational
breakthrough. But while CRISPR shows great promise in the development of
new cures for long-untreatable diseases, [[it could]{.underline}]{.mark}
also [[lead to a]{.mark} whole **[new generation of deadly
bioweapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[That's a prospect that increasingly alarms U.S. intelligence
officials]{.underline}. In 2016, then-Director of National Intelligence
James Clapper warned Congress that "\[r\]esearch in genome editing
conducted by [countries with [different **regulatory**]{.mark} or
ethical **[standards]{.mark}**]{.underline} than those of western
countries probably [[increases]{.mark} the risk of [the creation
of]{.mark} potentially [harmful biological agents or
products]{.mark}]{.underline}." Although Clapper didn't name specific
countries, it soon became clear that he was referring mainly to China.
Four years later, his successor, John Ratcliffe, issued a far more
pointed warning that "China has even conducted human testing on members
of the People's Liberation Army in hope of developing soldiers with
biologically enhanced capabilities. There are no ethical boundaries to
Beijing's pursuit of power." Such capabilities are almost certainly only
speculative---but they underscore why [**biotech [leadership]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} so [[important for]{.mark} national
[security]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as economic competitiveness.

Beijing has long envied the United States's dominant position in
biotechnology and spent heavily to overtake it. Biotech has been a
priority sector for state investment since the 1980s, and by one
estimate Beijing had poured some \$100 billion into the sector by 2018.
Nowhere did it lavish more attention or invest more of its propaganda
power than in developing a coronavirus vaccine. State media have spent
months crowing that "China is working around the clock for breakthroughs
in COVID-19 vaccines." Yet despite this push, China's vaccine program
quickly took on a Potemkin air. In February 2020, barely two months
after the onset of the pandemic and after a supposedly crash vaccine
effort, a military doctor stood in front of a Chinese flag to receive
what was billed as an experimental vaccine dose but was widely suspected
to be a staged photo op. Now, having spent months talking up its two
primary vaccine candidates to developing countries like Brazil and
Indonesia, both of which have entered into purchase agreements with
Chinese biotech firms, Chinese officials face severe mistrust among
their nation's overseas partners.

For China's leaders, the disappointing returns on their big bet on
[[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} look likely to cause them more
headaches at home as well as abroad---there are already signs that
affluent Chinese place more trust in foreign-developed coronavirus
vaccines than the homegrown ones produced at such great expense. For
U.S. officials, though, China's relative underperformance in vaccine
development [[presents an opportunity to reassert]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates's
[leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} in biotechnology and public health
[[and **bolster the nation's**]{.mark} **depleted [soft power]{.mark}**
in the process]{.underline}. The Biden administration has already
signaled it will reengage in multilateral bodies such as the World
Health Organization.

Yet the U.S. shouldn't stop there. Washington should begin thinking now
about how to emulate the success of the President's Emergency Plan for
AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)---which, though imperfect, is widely regarded as
one of the most successful single public health interventions in
history---to address growing disparities in access to coronavirus
vaccines between countries. At the moment, vaccine supplies are
controlled largely by rich countries, creating the risk of moral and
public health failure if the gap persists. While COVID-19, the
respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, differs in many
respects from AIDS, PEPFAR combined research, prevention, and access to
therapeutics. Developing a comparable **[[institutional
structure]{.underline}]{.mark}** to close the coronavirus vaccine access
gap is the right thing to do---but it [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[go a long way to **restoring** America's]{.mark} battered **[global
reputation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

At the same time, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[can't]{.mark} afford to [rest on its laurels in]{.mark}
**[biotech]{.mark}**nology]{.underline}, or any other field. Aside from
China, other nations like Singapore and Israel have also invested
heavily to develop their biotechnology sectors, with Israel in
particular giving rise to a thriving biotech industry. [U.S. public
[investment]{.mark} in basic scientific research and development
[has]{.mark} meanwhile [been on the decline]{.mark} for decades, [and
there are worrying signs that America's]{.mark} once world-beating
[innovation ecosystem is less productive]{.mark}, and less
entrepreneurial, than it once was]{.underline}. Despite strengths in
translational research, moreover, the frontiers of biology increasingly
sit at the intersection with other disciplines like computer science,
meaning that funding agencies, universities and other organizations need
to break down disciplinary silos. Boosting [[support]{.mark} for
biotechnology research]{.underline}, while reforming how that money is
used, [[will go a long way toward shoring up the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates's **[leading position]{.mark} in
the global biotech sector**]{.underline}.

The U.S. biotechnology sector also faces other threats, not least
growing espionage and intellectual property theft by foreign actors,
especially those linked to China. Several high-profile cases brought by
the U.S. Department of Justice's China Initiative have involved
biotechnology researchers, and American [[biotech firms have been top
targets for]{.mark} cyber [theft and intrusion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Sustained outreach to researchers and research institutions is critical
to preventing such theft. But efforts to clamp down on the threats posed
by espionage and intellectual property theft can easily go too far and
must preserve the researcher mobility and data-sharing that is essential
to doing cutting-edge science.

[Beyond its shores, the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [should
work with its partners and allies to enhance export controls on
dual-use]{.mark} [biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}---used for both
peaceful and military gain---especially DNA templates. Many forms of
genetic material and synthetic biology products are already subject to
U.S. export controls, but gaps remain, and screening for genetic
sequence orders relies primarily on voluntary regulation by biotech
firms. [**[Better coordinating]{.mark}** export controls [among]{.mark}
major economies and [U.S. allies can dramatically **reduce the risk of
sophisticated bioweapons**]{.mark} development in the decades to
come]{.underline}.

When it comes to biotechnology, the industry of the future, [the U.S.
remains]{.underline} well [ahead of its rivals, including
China]{.underline}. That's something Americans can, and should, take
pride in. [But the U.S. must make proactive investments and undertake
significant reforms now to ensure that things stay that
way]{.underline}.

### 1AC Advantage -- U.S. hegemony

#### NATO biotech coop maintains U.S. hegemony and neutralizes China's rise

Matthew P. **Goodman '21**, October 13, Senior Vice President for
Economics, "Toward a T12: Putting Allied Technology Cooperation into
Practice," CSIS,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/toward-t12-putting-allied-technology-cooperation-practice

[The other driver of increased interest in allied technology cooperation
is the fact that [the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[no longer holds an unrivaled lead]{.mark} in the development and
deployment of critical technologies]{.underline}. This is partly the
result of underinvestment in the traditional foundations of U.S.
innovation---such as infrastructure, federal research and development
(R&D), relevant education and skills---and partly due to rising
capabilities in other countries. In 2020, the United States ranked ninth
behind European and Asian competitors in Bloomberg's global innovation
index. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands have joined the
United States as critical players in semiconductor manufacturing.
[[China, Europe]{.mark}, Canada, and Israel all [have formidable]{.mark}
capabilities in AI and [biotech]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the global
telecommunications equipment market is dominated by two Chinese and two
European suppliers; the United States has no integrated-hardware
suppliers in a sector that forms the backbone of today's digital
economy.

[**[China poses a particular challenge]{.mark}** for the United States
in the technology arena]{.underline}. Supported by a rolling series of
initiatives launched by Beijing over the past 15 years---including the
"indigenous innovation" policies of the mid-2000s, the "Made in China
2025" plan released in 2015, and today's "dual circulation"
strategy---Chinese companies have rapidly move up the technology ladder.
According to the latest Global Innovation Index, China is ranked 12th in
the world, a significant rise from its 35th place ranking in 2013. China
now leads in the rollout of fifth-generation (5G) telecommunications
systems, with the greatest number of cell sites deployed and per capita
network subscribers. It also leads in AI adoption rates; an August 2019
report by the Center for Data Innovation found that 32 percent of
Chinese firms had adopted AI technologies, compared to 22 percent of
U.S. firms.

China's growing technological prowess has been a double-edged sword for
the United States. On one hand, it has powered China's growth, providing
new sources of economic demand and market opportunities for U.S.
exporters. It has enabled global supply-chain efficiencies, with U.S.
producers using China as a source of high-tech inputs and a platform for
final assembly. It has also promoted beneficial R&D collaboration and
enhanced the U.S. talent pool as Chinese researchers and entrepreneurs
have moved across the Pacific.

On the other hand, [[China's]{.mark} technological [rise has created a
new **competitive challenge**]{.mark} **for the United
States**]{.underline}, with several dimensions. Chinese technologies in
many areas, from 5G equipment to digital payments, are now global market
leaders. China's progress in AI, drones, and other
[[tech]{.mark}nologies with military applications [has raised serious
**national security concerns in Washington**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
Beijing's massive subsidies and other distortive industrial policies
threaten to tilt the competitive playing field in China's favor and
upend the rules and norms of the global economy that the United States
has championed since World War II. At the same time, growing
technological interdependence with China has created supply-chain
vulnerabilities in critical technologies, from semiconductors to
biopharmaceuticals.

Against the backdrop of these shifts in technology and the global
competitive landscape, [[allied]{.mark} **technology
[cooperation]{.mark}** [could]{.mark} kill several birds with one stone:
[support]{.mark}ing [U.S. and allied competitiveness]{.mark}; improving
global supply chain resilience; upholding and updating the rules and
norms of the global economy; [addressing]{.mark} shared global
challenges, such as **climate change** and **pandemics**; and helping
mitigate the **[national security]{.mark}** and other risks that some
dual-use technologies pose]{.underline}.

This brief is primarily focused on the promotion of new technologies to
achieve the more positive of these goals. The protection of critical
technologies for national-security purposes is no less important but has
received more attention to date from policymakers and scholars alike,
including at CSIS. For example, the CSIS Economics Program released a
report in August 2020 highlighting lessons from an allied-government
forum convened to discuss multilateral cooperation on investment
screening mechanisms, export controls, and other technology-transfer
policies. Moreover, there are particular complexities involved in the
promotion of new technologies that can impede cooperation, including
market competition among allied firms and divergent regulatory
philosophies across countries.

Early Progress, Challenges Ahead

The Biden administration has moved quickly to lay the foundations for
allied technology cooperation. In March, the president joined his
counterparts from Japan, Australia, and India for the first-ever Quad
summit, at which the leaders agreed to establish a critical and emerging
technology working group. Similar groups were set up as part of the
U.S.-Japan Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partnership and the
U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The agenda for each of these
groups includes a heavy focus on cooperation to promote and protect
critical technologies, including by jointly developing standards in
areas like AI and the Internet of Things, harmonizing data governance
rules, and aligning investment screening and export control policies.
The findings of the Biden administration's 100-day supply chain review,
released in June, stressed the importance of working with allies and
partners to address supply chain vulnerabilities in four critical
sectors, including semiconductors.

Putting these cooperative efforts into practice will be more challenging
than agreeing to them on paper. While the members of these various
groupings espouse democratic values and a commitment to multilateralism,
each brings to the table a distinct philosophy and approach to
technology development and digital governance. The European Union, for
example, considers personal data privacy a fundamental human right,
deserving of thorough protection under law and regulation. The United
States, by contrast, is in the midst of a roiling debate about the
appropriate balance between data privacy and the use of data for
commercial, national security, and other purposes that may be at odds
with individual privacy. In the area of standard setting for new
technologies, most countries take a top-down, government-led approach,
while in the U.S. case, this work is led by the private sector. More
broadly, views on the appropriate balance between market mechanisms and
state intervention, or between free trade and protection of domestic
producers, vary widely among potential members of a technology alliance.
These differences in philosophy and approach produce different forms of
law, regulation, and policy across a potential T12 that will be
difficult to reconcile in practice.

Moreover, while the United States and its allies share many values and
interests, they are also economic competitors. U.S., European, and Asian
companies compete globally for profits and market shares. Their
willingness to collaborate only goes as far as will benefit them
commercially, or as far as government incentives can sway them to
collaborate through subsidies or other incentives. And for political,
national security, and other reasons, governments naturally prioritize
the interests of their own companies over those in other countries. In
addition to impeding collaboration, national efforts to promote onshore
production in critical technologies could lead to redundancy and global
overcapacity.

This leads to a final set of challenges: organization of allied efforts.
Committing to cooperation in a press release is one thing;
follow-through is far more difficult. Working groups will need to have
the right structure, participants, and agenda. Leadership and
accountability are critical, with clear points of contact and processes
of decisionmaking within and among governments. These organizational
challenges will be especially difficult in a loose, fluid technology
alliance in which there may be differeces over who should be at the
table (not just countries but government agencies, private-sector
representatives, and others); which sectors and technologies should be
prioritized; and what kind of practical cooperation is appropriate.
Moreover, it will be important to ensure that new allied efforts do not
duplicate or disrupt existing technology collaborations.

Setting Priorities

The effectiveness of any technology alliance will depend on
prioritization. Allies cannot work together on every new technology or
address every issue that either enables or impedes cooperation. They
will have to make choices, particularly on two questions: Which
technologies are most critical for---and amenable to---allied
cooperation? And where along the chain of technology development are the
greatest opportunities for---and obstacles to---allied cooperation?

WHICH TECHNOLOGIES?

In his first major speech as President Biden's national security
adviser, Jake Sullivan highlighted four sectors that will define what he
called "the third wave of the digital revolution": AI,
**[[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, semiconductors, and
telecommunications. This is a reasonable list around which to explore
the possibility for allied cooperation. These sectors increasingly shape
how we make decisions, how we physically live and breathe, how we power
technology, and how we communicate. The potential for [[growth]{.mark}
and innovation]{.underline} in these four areas [[over the next
decade]{.mark} or two [is enormous. They are]{.mark} also [technologies
on which international competition is likely to be **most
intense**]{.mark}---[and]{.mark} on which the [benefits of
cooperation]{.mark} are potentially [greatest]{.mark}.
**[China]{.mark}**, in particular, [has set its sights on **global
preeminence**]{.mark} in all four of these areas]{.underline}.

Each of these areas has great potential for expanded cooperation among
allies:

AI refers to the creation of smart machines that can mimic human
learning and thought-process capabilities. This technology allows
machines to operate human-run tasks, potentially improving the cost,
accuracy, and efficiency of these activities. China is dedicating
significant state resources toward AI tech development, with potentially
troubling commercial and military implications for the United States and
its allies. There is a solid foundation for allied cooperation on AI.
Research collaboration in this area is already well established,
including a formal partnership between the U.S. National Science
Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada on technology research, of which AI is an important component,
and the 2020 U.S.-UK declaration to further cooperation in AI R&D.
Expanding this kind of research collaboration, particularly on scaling
and commercializing AI technologies, could help get allied AI products
to market and ensure they are competitive with Chinese alternatives.
Moreover, there are several useful international policy frameworks on
which to build out allied cooperation. These include the G7-led Global
Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Principles on AI, and AI
provisions in regional trade arrangements, including the Singapore-led
Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).

[[Biotech]{.mark}nology, the creation of products through biological
materials or processes, [has **enormous potential**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[for solving health, agriculture, and **environmental challenges**.
Moreover, one of the most important areas of potential for biotech lies
in its ability [to transform]{.mark} the [manufacturing]{.mark}
sector]{.underline}. Biomanufacturing---the application of biotech in
manufacturing---will allow countries to not only create different types
of products but to do so in new, more sustainable ways. For example,
Cambium BioMaterials, a Bay Area start-up, recently biomanufactured an
enhanced flame-retardant material using plant-based ingredients that is
now being used in commercial and military grade. [[China]{.mark}, the
world's leading manufacturer, [already dedicates significant
resources]{.mark} to support innovation in biotech, for potential
commercial and military purposes. [Allied cooperation on biotech is
nascent]{.mark} at this point, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} the United
States, Germany, Singapore, and Israel are notable leaders in the field,
and **[[there is significant scope for building out
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Semiconductors are "the brains of modern electronics." They control the
flow of electrical currents in electronic devices, making them a
critical component of the technologies of both today and tomorrow. And
as the world's digital transformation accelerates, so does the demand
for semiconductors. The world needs more large-scale semiconductor
production facilities to meet this demand, but because it is
increasingly expensive and complex to produce semiconductors, no one
country can solely support this expansion. The semiconductor industry is
already one that benefits from specialization---and cooperation---across
allies and partners, with the United States dominating front-end
research and design, and East Asian countries---including Taiwan, South
Korea, and Japan---leading the manufacturing segment of the supply
chain. Yet China has set its sights on assuming global leadership in
advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as detailed in Beijing's 2014
Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development.
In response to that and other foreign government subsidy programs for
semiconductor development, the U.S. Congress enacted the Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America (CHIPS) Act in
the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. If funded, this would
direct \$52 billion of federal money toward domestic semiconductor
manufacturing and R&D. The Biden administration has supported the CHIPS
Act as critical to sustaining U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors,
but it will also be important to enhance cooperation with allies and
partners on this foundation technology.

Telecommunications---the transmission of data via wire, radio waves,
optical fiber, and other means---are the backbone of today's
interconnected economy. The technology underlying telecom networks has
advanced rapidly in the past two to three decades through several
"generations." The global market for telecom equipment is dominated by a
handful of vertically integrated suppliers such as Huawei and ZTE of
China, Ericsson of Sweden, and Nokia of Finland. The sector is highly
susceptible to first-mover advantages; the first company to deploy the
latest generation network (5G) doesn't have to compete with other
companies for subscribers and network partners, amassing large shares of
both and making it easier for the company to deploy other technologies
(telecom equipment, phones, radios, etc.) to their subscribers and
network partners. China has moved aggressively in international forums
and markets to try to harness the first-mover advantage by setting
standards that favor its telecom networks and equipment. This poses a
critical challenge to the United States and allied countries,
particularly in their ability to secure competitive market shares for
their telecom and other network-dependent technology. Allied efforts are
already underway to try to diminish the impact of the first-mover
advantage by promoting the use of the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)
platform, which is not reliant on supplier-specific software or
hardware. The O-RAN Alliance, a group of over 270 telecommunications
operators and vendors that are dedicated to creating "fully
interoperable mobile networks," and the Open RAN Policy Coalition, a
group of 60 technology companies from around the world dedicated to the
advancement and adoption of open RANs, are critical groups of allied
companies working to foster a collaborative environment for
telecommunication technology. The United States and Japan have been
particularly active in their efforts to innovate in telecoms and compete
with China, notably through joint investments in 6G development under
the countries' newly launched Global Digital Connectivity Partnership.
Allied efforts in telecommunications can help expand these efforts and
increase O-RAN adoption.

WHERE TO FOCUS COOPERATION?

After agreeing on the technologies to prioritize, allies will need to
decide how to direct their efforts along the technology development
chain and what substantive issues to focus on. There are opportunities
to expand cooperation across a range of activities, from research
collaboration to joint financing. In roundtables and conversations with
experts conducted by the CSIS Economics Program as part of this project,
two cross-cutting issues repeatedly came up: data and standards.
Focusing allied efforts on aligning approaches in these two areas would
make a significant contribution to joint promotion of critical
technologies.

After agreeing on the technologies to prioritize, allies will need to
decide how to direct their efforts along the technology development
chain and what substantive issues to focus on.

Data

In 2020, the world generated some 44 zettabytes of data---"40 times more
bytes than there are stars in the observable universe." Data are
everywhere, fueling technology and informing our decisions and
innovation choices. In biotechnology, for example, data analytics help
biopharmaceutical researchers identify drug candidates for early-stage
testing and drug development. Progress in AI development is largely a
function of data and the computing power to process it.

These and similar innovations are dependent on data quantity, quality,
and diversity---how much data one has, how accurate and usable those
data are, and how many different types of data are available. As the
Global Data Alliance, an industry coalition, notes, greater data
quantity allows researchers and firms to "identify meaningful insights,
patterns, and connections that can aid R&D teams in discovering and
developing novel solutions to scientific and technical challenges."
Access to high-quality data enables faster, more reliable discoveries.
Data diversity helps researchers and firms broaden these discoveries,
applying them to new products, patients, and processes.

Data are essential to allied technology efforts for the seemingly simple
reason that sharing data is beneficial. Sharing increases the quantity
of data and therefore the potential for new discoveries. But it also
improves the quality of data, by allowing entities to verify their data
against data held by others and to inform, supplement, and complement
their data. Sharing data can also increase the diversity of data sets,
allowing researchers and producers to apply their results to a wider
range of products and demographics. This is especially important in the
development of AI, where access to different types of data allows
machines to make better decisions.

For all the benefits of data sharing, a number of frictions impede
allied cooperation in this area. These include national laws and
policies to protect the privacy and security of sensitive data. Every
government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that sensitive
personal, business, and government information does not get into the
wrong hands, and law and policy in this area nearly always restrict the
use and sharing of this data in some ways. The problem is when these
restrictions inhibit reasonable, responsible, and ethical data sharing
with organizations in like-minded countries involved in joint research
projects. There are emerging differences in national philosophies and
regulatory approaches to data privacy and security that complicate, or
may preclude, allied data sharing in support of joint promotion of
critical technologies.

As mentioned earlier, the European Union considers personal data privacy
a human right and has put into law what is arguably the global standard
for data protection in its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Several other countries have enacted data laws based on GDPR, including
South Korea and India. For its part, the United States has a patchwork
of privacy rules at the state and sectoral level but no comprehensive
federal legislation in this area. By contrast, data security has taken
on new salience in Washington, as highlighted by President Biden's
signing of an executive order in this area in June. How this will affect
Washington's historic position that data should generally flow freely
across borders remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, several allied and partner countries have also enacted data
localization policies, which require data to be stored domestically.
This can silo data within states, impede data flows, and undermine
innovation. According to a report by the Information Technology and
Innovation Foundation (ITIF), as of 2020, 62 countries had enacted 144
data localization policies. Many governments such as the European Union
and South Korea claim that data localization is necessary to protect
"important" or "sensitive" data from being shared; U.S. financial
regulators take a similar view with respect to financial data. However,
localization policies are often broadly applied and seem to be less
about legitimate protection than about protectionism.

Efforts to bridge the differences among allies on data flows, privacy,
and security have so far had mixed success. Japan has usefully put
forward the concept of "data free flow with trust (DFFT)" and won both
G7 and G20 endorsement of the idea, but it has yet to be turned into an
agreed set of rules and practices. To facilitate data flows across the
Atlantic, the United States and the European Union negotiated a "privacy
shield" in 2016, providing a mechanism for companies to comply with GDPR
regulations when transferring data from Europe to the United States.
However, in 2020, the European Court of Justice found that the framework
failed to meet GDPR standards and subsequently invalidated the policy.
Without a replacement framework, transatlantic technology cooperation
will be constrained.

More positively, as detailed in a CSIS report in April 2021, there has
been useful work on developing agreed approaches to data governance in a
number of recent trade agreements, particularly among U.S. partners in
the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
incorporates and builds on commitments to substantially free
cross-border data flows and other rules the United States won agreement
to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) before it pulled out in early
2017. Similar provisions were included in the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade
Agreement concluded in 2019. And Singapore has been a leader in aligning
data governance policies through its bilateral trade agreements, in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and through its
innovative DEPA arrangement.

Moving forward, to capitalize on the innovation gains that come from
sharing data and promote meaningful allied technology cooperation, the
Biden administration should focus on several lines of effort to
reconcile the divergent approaches to data governance among its key
allies. First, it should work with Congress to enact comprehensive
federal privacy legislation. Second, it should use the new TTC forum
with the European Union to align transatlantic positions on data
privacy, security, and flows. Third, it should embrace the work on data
governance in the Asia-Pacific region, starting by docking onto DEPA.
And fourth, it should work to identify areas where U.S. agencies can
pool data with like-minded countries in the interest of conducting joint
research on issues of mutual concern. (For example, NIST could combine
data with UK or EU counterparts to improve the accuracy of facial
recognition tests.) These efforts will help improve the quantity,
quality, and diversity of allied data sets, enabling greater innovation
opportunities for allied researchers and firms in critical sectors such
as AI, biotech, semiconductors, and telecommunications.

Standards

The term "standards" is used to describe a broad array of rules,
metrics, and norms, ranging from ubiquitous technical specifications
like Bluetooth to safety requirements such as the warning labels found
on lawn mowers to expected approaches that establish a certain baseline
such as in accounting standards. In all these variations, standards
convey a sense of expectation of performance. There are broadly two
types of standards: consensus standards and technical regulations.
Consensus standards are the outcomes of processes where general
agreement rather than unanimity is sought and the development of such
outcomes is voluntary. Technical regulations refer to the use of
standards by the government to meet a specific policy objective and
where conformance with the standard is mandatory.

Standards are critical to innovation for two reasons: first, they
provide a foundation for technology development upon which product
differentiation can be made, which makes it easier to deploy competitive
products, including by leveraging first-mover advantages; and second,
they boost product interoperability and consumer confidence in
technologies, expanding existing technology markets and helping to
create new ones. The focus here is mainly on voluntary standards
because, as with data governance, there is arguably more work to be done
to align allied approaches.

[Global standards are typically set in a broad range of bodies that are
open to participation by all interested stakeholders]{.underline} and
where decisionmaking is done by consensus. Examples of such as bodies
include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the
Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Participants in these
bodies include a mix of government and private-sector researchers and
other experts from the member countries. The process for reaching
agreement on standards varies by organization, with different thresholds
in balloting that help establish consensus.

As is the case with data governance, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [and its allies have different approaches]{.mark} to
standard setting]{.underline}. While government agencies such as the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of
Defense, and the Department of Transportation participate in many
standard-setting bodies, Washington does not lead in setting technical
standards. It is the long-standing policy of the United States to allow
the private sector to take the lead, leveraging the extensive technical
expertise and experience available in industry and its knowledge of
market need and demands. This private-sector--led approach---in which
the U.S. government participates as a contributor, user, and
enforcer---has helped establish and maintain U.S. industrial and
technological leadership since World War II. By contrast, governments in
Europe and Asia tend to have a top-down approach to standard setting,
establishing standardization priorities and attempting to develop and
protect domestic champions. In order to achieve these objectives, these
governments often send a large number of officials to push for preferred
national outcomes.

While there is a strong case for the U.S. government to step up its
long-term game in international standard setting---for example, by
investing in and adequately resourcing government experts to participate
in global standards work---the likelihood that the United States and its
allies will align their approaches in standard-setting bodies is low. In
addition to the philosophical differences, these countries are also
competitors and want their own companies and technologies to "win" in
the marketplace. There are numerous examples of such competition in
emerging technologies such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, and
advanced manufacturing. Moreover, the industry-led U.S. approach, with
its competitive dynamics among actors who have a better sense of the
market potential of new technologies than governments, arguably has real
advantages over the top-down approach used by Europe and other allies.

[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} more [[productive line of effort for U.S.
policymakers]{.mark} seeking [to promote]{.mark} greater [allied
alignment in]{.mark} the [tech]{.mark}nical standards [would be to
encourage]{.mark} pre-standardization
**[cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here it is useful to explore the
concept of "technology readiness levels (TRLs)." These measure the
maturity of technology along a spectrum from early-stage basic research
to commercialization and deployment of technology. The lower the TRL,
the less developed the technology and the greater the need is for
fundamental research and development. Collaboration at low TRLs---basic
research---is already well established. International standard setting
happens at higher TRLs, where, as discussed above, allied cooperation
faces a number of challenges. The opportunity lies in the middle of the
TRL spectrum, where governments could help researchers collaborate on
basic research and develop shared insights and data and, by so doing,
set the stage for more productive standards cooperation and, even
further along the technology-development spectrum, promote regulatory
convergence among allies.

In addition to encouraging pre-standardization cooperation, Washington
could do more to engender trust and cooperation with the private sector
on standard setting and related policies. With its extensive firsthand
experience, the private sector can help the government better understand
the true dynamics of standard-setting rivalries in different standards
bodies. Greater public-private exchange of perspectives on the
commercial and national security dimensions of emerging technologies
would also be valuable. Also, as mentioned above, small amounts of
additional funding for government experts' participation in---though not
direction of---international standard-setting work could improve
public-private coordination and support U.S.-preferred outcomes.

While the focus here has mainly been on technical standards, [it
is]{.underline} also [important for the U.S. government to work closely
with allies on aligning regulatory approaches to technology. In addition
to promoting positive U.S.-preferred norms such as environmental and
social sustainability of technology, these efforts would help minimize
the scope for misuse or ethical breaches of new
technologies]{.underline}. The OECD Principles on AI, for example, are
designed to ensure that development of AI technologies adheres to global
democratic and human rights values. The International Bioethics
Committee (IBC), housed under UNESCO, is another body working to develop
normative requirements to safeguard human rights in the development and
use of biotechnologies.

Getting Organized

Promotion of critical technologies is a complex and challenging
undertaking, even within a single country. The challenges are compounded
when coordinating efforts with other countries. An effective technology
alliance will require organizational structures and processes---both
within the United States and across allies and partners---that maximize
the benefits of cooperation and remove or overcome obstacles.

Effective organization starts at home. The Biden administration has
taken some useful first steps in this regard. They have rhetorically
made the case for promotion and protection of critical technologies and
for coordinating these efforts with allies. The White House has created
a new senior position in the National Security Council staff for
technology policy coordination and has elevated the head of the Office
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to cabinet level to improve
internal U.S. government coordination. And it has made technology
cooperation a top agenda item for plurilateral forums of like-minded
countries such as the Quad and G7, as well as in bilateral engagement
with Europe, Japan, and other technology partners. Meanwhile, the U.S.
Congress has taken steps to provide legislative and financial support
for allied technology cooperation, including through measures such as
the U.S Innovation and Competitiveness Act (USICA) passed by the Senate
in June.

An effective technology alliance will require organizational structures
and processes---both within the United States and across allies and
partners---that maximize the benefits of cooperation and remove or
overcome obstacles.

However, there are still gaps and inconsistencies in Washington's
efforts at home to set the groundwork for a technology alliance.
Announcing a new policy direction is one thing; carrying it out in a
sustained and consistent way is far more challenging. This requires a
well-functioning interagency process under the direction of the White
House that deploys relevant parts of the U.S. government. The Biden
administration has been slow to appoint senior officials at the under-
and assistant-secretary level at key economic agencies, who are critical
to effective policy formulation and implementation. Even when these
officials are in place, they need to be empowered to do the day-to-day
work of coordinating policy with allies, with direction---but not
micromanagement---from the White House.

Moreover, Washington needs to make important substantive investments at
home if it wants to win support from allies for its positions on the
cross-cutting issues discussed above. To promote its preferred approach
to global data governance, for example, the United States needs to enact
comprehensive federal privacy legislation. It needs to revitalize the
U.S. approach to standard setting, doing more to support the efforts of
private companies and experts in this area. And it needs to recommit to
the U.S. innovation base by, among other things, increasing federal R&D
spending, investing in skills, and building digital infrastructure.
(Detailed recommendations in these areas were included in the CSIS Trade
Commission's October 2020 report, Sharpening America's Innovative Edge.)

One more chore for the Biden administration is to reconcile the tension
between its appeal to allies for technology cooperation, on one hand,
and its stated preference to "buy American" and to onshore production of
critical technologies and supplies, on the other. Allies will be
reluctant to sign onto cooperation if they have doubts about what is in
it for them. This is an even more pointed question for allies still
subject to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

Progress on these domestic organizational and messaging challenges will
need to be complemented by work to organize international cooperation on
technology promotion. Again, the Biden administration has made a good
start on agenda setting in the Quad and G7 and with bilateral partners
such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany. It has wisely avoided calling
for a single T12 forum with a predetermined group of countries; the kind
of "variable geometry" it has been promoting is more suited to an issue
area with a complex mix of critical technologies and country
capabilities.

But there is still work to be done to stitch all these strands together.
[[It is]{.mark} especially [important for Washington to]{.mark} resolve
its differences with Europe over the regulation of technology and data,
or at least to close the gap enough to [**align**
**transatlantic**]{.mark} (essentially, G7) and transpacific (Quad)
**[approaches]{.mark}** to these issues]{.underline}. It will also be
important to pull in other economies as needed that are not in the Quad
or G7 but have advanced capabilities in key technologies---such as the
Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan on semiconductors or Finland and
Sweden on 5G---without making the web of allied cooperative efforts too
cumbersome.

[With more alignment of key players within a technology alliance,
[Washington will]{.mark} then [want to reinforce and]{.mark} build out
[work in **international institutions** in which it retains
disproportionate influence]{.mark} to develop U.S.-preferred rules,
standards, and norms. **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the OECD have
done useful work to promote common principles on AI, for example; the
latter has also done important work on data governance. Allies
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[need to **align**]{.mark}
**positions**]{.underline} in standard-setting bodies with a more
diverse membership such as the International Telecommunication Union.

**NATO biotech involvement is key to check China and maintain
international order**

The second and related driver is maintaining a technological edge. [The
perception that [technological dominance]{.mark}]{.underline} (and the
imperative to avoid strategic technological surprise) [[is an inherent
strategic advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} is well established in the
strategic culture [[of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and many allies. [Over
the past two decades, the technological [dominance]{.mark} of the
West]{.underline}---from stealth to long-range precision strike
capabilities---[[has been]{.mark} increasingly [challenged]{.mark},
especially [by]{.mark}]{.underline} Russia and
[[China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Officially, NATO and some of the leading
allies continue to pursue the goal of maintaining a technological
edge---in relation to EDTs.12 This message is an essential component of
NATO's geopolitical signaling and consistent with its policy of
competing from a position of strength. However, there is a growing
informal recognition among the allies of the magnitude of the challenge
to maintain technological dominance across all critical emerging
technologies. In view of the trajectory of Chinese investment in EDTs,
[[it is important for NATO to develop its resilience, deterrence, and
defense, to improve its adaptability, and to be prepared to
mitigate]{.mark} adverse conditions where [rivals]{.mark} temporarily
achieve technological parity or even dominance]{.underline}.

[The third driver is to foster the interoperability of military
capabilities that are enabled by emerging technologies]{.underline}13
[and to incentivize transatlantic defense cooperation on EDTs to avoid
or bridge technology gaps between allies]{.underline}. This goes to the
core of NATO's mission to deter and defend against threats, but it is an
enduring challenge. [Streamlining standardization and testing,
evaluation, verification, and validation procedures remains
important]{.underline}. However, [[NATO should]{.mark} also **[double
down]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} its efforts to ensure greater compliance with
interoperability and baseline requirements for the [security]{.mark} of
critical [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. Recent challenges in
relation to national compliance with the 2019 NATO requirements for
security of telecommunications infrastructure are a case in point, but
there are wider and enduring challenges with hardware and communications
interoperability.14 While the plans for the new Defence Innovation
Accelerator promise to contribute to maintaining NATO's technological
edge, [it also remains to be seen whether they will contribute
sufficiently to building technology capacity among some of the smaller
and more vulnerable allies]{.underline}. As they establish governance
procedures and participation rules, allies need to mitigate the risk
that the accelerator could contribute to a two-speed, two-tier alliance,
dividing the technology haves from the technology have-nots.

[The fourth driver is a desire to lead in setting global, normative EDTs
governance]{.underline}. [The Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive
Technologies]{.underline}, for example, [has emphasized that **[NATO "is
exceptionally well placed to be a global driver]{.mark}** of a
values-based innovation agenda]{.underline}."15 [Democratic values are
at the core of what defines security for transatlantic allies and the
target of adversarial subversive measures]{.underline}. Consequently,
embedding democratic values into the development, adoption, and use of
EDTs by the allies is key to NATO's mission. Thus, [[innovation efforts
need to be closer linked to NATO's]{.mark} democracy-centered [tech
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} with like-minded global partners, some of
whom could be invited to join the Defence Innovation Accelerator.

[The fifth driver is organizational and procedural change, notably to
build "a resilient innovation pipeline for the alliance"16 and a
sustainable innovation ecosystem]{.underline}. This is a more
challenging undertaking than it may first appear. [Military
organizations have historically innovated more coherently and
efficiently than other public organizations.]{.underline}17 [However, in
the case of EDTs, this pattern is challenged. NATO and allied military
organizations are not driving technological progress, are not the main
agents of innovation, and depend on effective civilian-military
collaboration for their own innovation efforts]{.underline}. Defense
Agency organized a ten-day Technology Foresight Exercise to inform the
revision of the European research and capability development
priorities.25 Rob Murray, the head of NATO Innovation Unit has argued
that "the nations that win \[the technology adoption\] race may be those
with the most agile bureaucracy rather those with the best
technology."26 [[Organizational change is a **prerequisite** of success
in]{.mark} defense innovation and the adoption of EDTs---and one aspect
of [NATO's adaptation]{.mark} patterns]{.underline}. But it is only one
measure of its success. [Setting the right benchmarks for defense
innovation and EDTs is also critical and it requires a link to clear and
measurable improvements in military capabilities, posture and power
projection, enhanced resilience, and deterrence and defense in a
multi-domain framework]{.underline}, as well as the ability to compete
below the threshold of armed conflict against hybrid threats. To this
effect, [[NATO needs to be linked to more experimentation]{.mark},
wargaming, and red teaming [to determine how deterrence, defense, and
operational capacity will evolve, how resilience can be enhanced, and
how to **disrupt rival**]{.mark} **coercive [operations]{.mark}**, above
and **[below the threshold of armed conflict]{.mark}**, across all
domains of warfare.]{.underline}

#### Losing the tech race to China causes nuclear escalation among major powers

**Kroenig**, Mathew, Professor in the department of government at
Georgetown, Winter 20**21** ("Will Emerging Technology Cause Nuclear
War?: Bringing Geopolitics Back In", Air University, Winter, 2021,

accessed 6/27/22, ,FLC)

[Some]{.underline} may [argue emerging military technology is more
likely to result in a **[new tech]{.mark}** arms race than in
conflict]{.underline}. This is possible. [But Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline} may come to [believe]{.underline} (correctly or
not) that [new tech]{.underline}nology [[provides]{.underline}]{.mark}
them [[a usable military advantage over the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and
its Allies]{.mark} and partners.]{.underline} In so doing, they may
underestimate Washington.

[If Moscow or Beijing attacked a vulnerable US Ally or
partner]{.underline} in their near abroad, therefore, [there would be a
risk of major war with]{.underline} the potential for [nuclear
escalation]{.underline}. The United States has formal treaty commitments
with several frontline states as well as an ambiguous defense obligation
to Taiwan. If Russia or China were to attack these states, it is likely,
or at least possible, that the United States would come to the defense
of the victims. While many question the wisdom or credibility of
America's global commitments, [[it would be difficult for the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to]{.mark} simply [back
down]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Abandoning a treaty ally could cause fears
that [America's global commitments would unravel]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Any US president, therefore, would feel great pressure to come to an
Ally's defense and expel Russian or Chinese forces.

Once the United States and Russia or China are at war, there would be a
risk of nuclear escalation. As noted previously, experts assess the
greatest risk of nuclear war today does not come from a
bolt-out-of-the-blue strike but from nuclear escalation in a regional,
conventional conflict.53 Russian leaders may believe it is in their
interest to use nuclear weapons early in a conflict with the United
States and NATO.54 Russia possesses a large and diverse arsenal,
including thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, to support this
nuclear strategy.

In the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, Washington indicates it could
retaliate against any Russian nuclear "de-escalation" strikes with
limited nuclear strikes of its own using low-yield nuclear weapons.55
The purpose of US strategy is to deter Russian strikes. If deterrence
fails, however, there is a clear pathway to nuclear war between the
United States and Russia. Will Emerging Technology Cause Nuclear War?:
Bringing Geopolitics Back In STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY → WINTER 2021
69 As Henry Kissinger pointed out decades ago, there is no guarantee
that, once begun, a limited nuclear war stays limited.56

[[There are]{.mark} similar [risks of **nuclear escalation** in the
event of a US-China conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. China has
traditionally possessed a relaxed nuclear posture with a small "lean and
effective" deterrent and a formal "no first use" policy. But [China is
relying more on its strategic forces. It is projected to double---if not
triple or quadruple---the size of its nuclear arsenal in the coming
decade]{.underline}.57

Chinese experts have acknowledged there is a narrow range of
contingencies in which China might use nuclear weapons first.58 As in
the case of Russia, the US Nuclear Posture Review recognizes the
possibility of limited Chinese nuclear attacks and also holds out the
potential of a limited US reprisal with low-yield nuclear weapons as a
deterrent.59 [If the nuclear threshold is breached [in a conflict
between the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and China,
the risk of **nuclear exchange** is real]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In short, if a coming revolution in military affairs provides a real or
perceived battlefield advantage for Russia or China, [[such a
development raises the likelihood of]{.underline}]{.mark} armed
aggression against US regional allies, [**[major power war]{.mark}**,
and an increased risk of nuclear escalation.]{.underline}

[[THE **U**]{.mark}NITED **[S]{.mark}**tates today [faces]{.mark} real
**[geopolitical peril]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and neither the Biden team
nor the broader U.S. foreign policy establishment acknowledges the
gravity of the situation. President-elect Joe [[Biden and his
advisers]{.mark} like to [speak not only of **renewed American
leadership**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but also of a **restoration of the
liberal international order**]{.mark} and the American ability to
simultaneously act as a revolutionary power and be at
peace]{.underline}. In fact, **[[the danger of]{.mark} a [nuclear
confrontation is growing]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This uncomfortable
truth is rarely acknowledged, but not for a lack of warning. Rather, a
new normal has emerged in American foreign policy debates where the
dangerous implications of U.S. policies are downplayed so that the
pursuit of American hegemony can continue unquestioned, without any
meaningful congressional scrutiny or the kind of genuine political
debate that existed during the Cold War. But in world politics, benign
intentions do not assure impunity.

At the same time, the United States is confronted by emboldened and
embittered adversaries such as China and Russia and handicapped by
confused and uncertain alliances---starting with NATO---which seem to
exist not so much as tools of U.S. foreign policy but as sacrosanct
symbols of Western virtue. Beyond these unnecessary adversaries and
uncertain alliances, [[there is]{.mark} also a **[growing fragmentation

From 2007 to 2008, tainted supplies of Chinese-manufactured heparin, a
common blood thinner, led to 81 deaths across the United States. This
should have been a wake-up call to the Department of Defense. Over the
last two decades, biotechnology has become a key component of American
supply chains, perhaps accounting for 20 percent of the chemicals the
U.S. military uses. Those supply chains now span the globe and contain a
significant amount of material produced in China. Remarkably, the full
extent of the military's dependence on Chinese biotechnology is unknown
because the U.S. government is not assessing it. These dependencies
extend beyond pharmaceuticals to fundamentals such as solvents and
polymers. Just try and paint an aircraft without xylenes. If you've
never thought about how difficult it would be, well that's exactly the
problem.

[The Department of Defense has historically viewed biotechnology
narrowly in relation to military medicine and biodefense. As a result,
[the vital role of]{.mark} [biotech]{.mark}nology in military readiness
and national security [remains poorly understood]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Biowarfare and bioterrorism are real risks, but approaching the nation's
biotechnology security needs only in these terms will leave the country
ever more vulnerable.

BECOME A MEMBER

[China, by contrast, has been integrating biotechnology into its
strategic development and elevating biotechnology to a key component of
national security]{.underline}. China's military-civil fusion
development strategy makes biotechnology a core priority for the
People's Liberation Army. This strategy has one goal: to bring together
China's civilian and military industrial bases in order to better
project power. To that end, China has cornered supply chains in multiple
sectors, including pharmaceuticals ingredients and other important
chemicals.

Stephanie Rogers, the Defense Department's acting principal director for
biotechnology, recently declared that "the nation that leads the world
in biotechnology will accrue enduring economic, societal, and defense
gains." Unfortunately, this awareness has yet to be reflected in
government policy[. Biotechnology security is national security --- for
the United States and for China. [The **D**]{.mark}epartment
**[o]{.mark}**f **[D]{.mark}**efense [should recognize
biotech]{.mark}nology's role [as]{.mark} a [foundational]{.mark}
technology and make biotechnology development and supply chain security
a priority.]{.underline}

Maintaining America's Biotechnology Advantage

[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [in the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [is a **significant contributor to the
economy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} By one estimate, in 2017, U.S.
biotechnology revenues exceeded \$400 billion, or 2 percent of gross
domestic product, substantially surpassing better-measured sectors such
as mining. Bioeconomy revenues have grown at an average rate of 10
percent annually for two decades. Notably, [U.S. biotechnology revenues
alone were approximately equal to worldwide semiconductor revenues for
2017]{.underline}. Biotechnology now supplies critical medicines, and,
as more than 90 percent of the corn and soy grown in the United States
is genetically modified, biotechnology feeds the armed forces.
Industrial biotechnology is responsible for upward of 20 percent of
chemicals produced in the United States, suggesting a similar proportion
of chemicals used in the military are also biologically derived. And
these impressive figures may still be significant underestimates: Using
a different methodology, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences recently
concluded that [the [biotech]{.mark}nology industry [contributes]{.mark}
5 to [7 percent of U.S.]{.mark} **[g]{.mark}**ross **[d]{.mark}**omestic
**[p]{.mark}**roduct]{.underline}. Biotechnology, therefore, may already
constitute an even larger share of the military supply chain.

[[As biotech]{.mark}nology [continues to mature]{.mark}, its
contribution to physical and economic security will become even more
significant]{.underline}. Tools are now being deployed that enable the
engineering and biomanufacturing of materials that will eventually not
only displace petrochemicals but also surpass them in production scale
and performance. [Over the next ten to twenty years, biological
[production could]{.mark} soon [supply]{.mark} up to **[60 percent
of]{.mark} physical inputs across [the global economy]{.mark}**, and
biotechnology could have [a "direct economic impact of]{.mark} up to
**[\$4 trillion a year]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[[While the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} arguably
[**still leading** in biotech]{.mark}nology, [it risks losing]{.mark}
this lead [to China]{.mark}. In [China]{.mark}, biotechnology is a
national development and a security matter. China's Innovation Driven
Development Strategy [emphasizes biotech]{.mark}nology's essential role
[in]{.mark} the country's [economic development]{.mark}]{.underline},
while the Military-Civil Fusion Development Strategy seeks to ensure
that biotechnology research is also oriented toward the country's
military and broader security goals. Chinese biotechnology revenues are
reported to be of a similar size to those in the United States, although
they are subject to even lesser clarity in reporting.

[While China continues its licit and illicit acquisition efforts
targeting the U.S. biotechnology sector, it is also shifting its
attention to domestic innovation]{.underline}. In time, this will
provide the People's Liberation Army with new capabilities and increase
both America's and the Pentagon's reliance on Chinese biotechnology
products.

Recommendations

As early as 1958, the Department of Commerce was tracking the economic
contribution of semiconductors, even though they made up less than 0.1
percent of the gross domestic product. Yet, today, the U.S. government
has made no equivalent effort to track the much more significant role of
biotechnology.

[This illiteracy is a national security issue. [American and Chinese
bioeconomies are in competition]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
[Beijing]{.mark} asserts that it [is investing with the intent to take,
and]{.mark} to then [maintain, the lead]{.mark}]{.underline}. To sustain
America's advantage, the U.S. Department of Defense should better
understand its reliance on biotechnology and increase investment in it
accordingly. The Pentagon's recent investment in the BioIndustrial
Manufacturing and Design Ecosystem is a notable step in the right
direction. However, the seven-year budget for this project is
approximately the cost of a single F-35A. For an investment that could
impact the entire defense supply chain, this is inadequate.

We recommend the following plan of action for the Department of Defense
to take its place alongside the Departments of Commerce and State in the
broader interagency effort to secure America's biotechnology advantage.

First, in close coordination with the Department of Commerce, the
Department of Defense should make a systematic effort to better
understand the role of biotechnology in the economy, supply chains, and
manufacturing. This, in turn, should inform additional oversight and
regulatory controls.

The responsibility to understand, prepare for, and respond to
biotechnology threats is balkanized, spread across at least nine
departments and agencies. Vulnerabilities in the bioeconomy will affect
the Department of Defense in terms of readiness, soldier health, and the
ability to fulfill missions. Addressing those vulnerabilities begins
with a sustained, comprehensive effort to understand the role of
biotechnology in industry today, as well as how that industry
contributes to defense supply chains, and how military acquisition
policy shapes biotechnology. To that end, the Pentagon should work with
the Department of Commerce to create domestic reporting codes for
biotechnology revenues and employment for the quarterly and annual
economic census, and further incorporate those codes into the North
American Industrial Classification System. Institutionalizing the
gathering of these data is the first step toward sustainable
policymaking and rational spending.

The Department of Commerce should then consider adding import/export
controls on biotechnology, while avoiding overly broad restrictions that
suffocate innovation. Protecting foundational technologies using the
Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act and Export Control
Reform Act will be critical for securing biotechnology. However,
biotechnology competition is not exclusive to commercial activities. The
Pentagon should assess critical vulnerabilities and dependencies to
assist the other agencies in bringing China's foreign biotechnology
access in line with standards in other major markets.

The Department of Defense has been asked to document and secure supply
chains critical to defense applications and to the overall U.S. economy.
This should also apply to biotechnology. Current Pentagon efforts to
expand domestic biological manufacturing capabilities are an important
start, but a broader effort is needed. An empowered deputy national
security adviser could help oversee the relationship between the
Pentagon and the National Economic Council to promote and secure the
military's broader technology needs.

Second, the Department of Defense should better study the
accomplishments and intent of China, especially the Chinese military, in
developing biotechnology as a strategic technology.

Once the Department of Defense better understands critical U.S.
biotechnology dependencies on China, it can begin the work of reducing
them. This requires an interagency examination to identify cross-cutting
resources, develop mitigation strategies, formulate best practices to
bolster innovation, and expand outreach to allies and partners to reduce
systemic gaps China could exploit. Partnership with industry and allies
will allow the U.S. government to understand and counter Beijing's
efforts to distort commercial activity in its favor.

To this end, the Department of Defense should mirror the National
Security Council's effort by creating an emerging technology portfolio
within Office of the Under Secretary of Defense-Policy. While other
technology offices in the Department of Defense are internally focused,
an entity in this office that concentrates externally on foundational
technology competition is required. Such an office may be able to
address uncertainties in assessments of Chinese biotechnology revenues
and capabilities.

Finally, in coordination with the Department of State, the Department of
Defense should identify opportunities for dialogue with the People's
Liberation Army about biotechnology-related security issues.

It is time to include biotechnology in the dialogue mechanisms that
compose bilateral U.S. defense relations with the People's Liberation
Army. This dialogue should prioritize the ethics of biotechnology in the
context of future conflicts, the escalatory risks this technology
creates, and the possibility of cooperation where the interests of the
two nations intersect. Both sides should work toward a common
understanding related to ethics, policies, and standards when
operationalizing biotechnology. This will help avoid miscalculation and
promote strategic stability.

Unlike the U.S. government, Chinese leadership has a carefully
considered position on the importance of biosafety and "biological
problems" in national security. While these problems are understood to
encompass traditional weapons concerns, they also extend to the health
of the entire natural world in the context of ever-expanding
applications of biotechnology. This position might provide an
opportunity for constructive engagement at a time when tensions are
rising.

Conclusion

[[The Pentagon needs to expand its approach]{.mark} to biotechnology
beyond biodefense. If China maintains biological warfare aspirations, by
all means address those. But defense planners should also address
China's broader approach to biotechnology and its integrated approach to
civil-military fusion.]{.underline}

[Securing biotechnology secures the nation. [Maintaining the U.S.
lead]{.mark} in biotechnology [is critical to the nation's
**economic**]{.mark} and military **[resilience]{.mark}** in war, peace,
and the gray zone short of conflict. [This requires]{.mark} better
biotechnology [collaboration]{.mark} --- within the U.S. government,
[with **allies and partners**]{.mark}, and even, where possible, with
competitors.]{.underline}

KUALA LUMPUR and BERLIN, Feb 12 2019 (IPS) - Economic recovery efforts
since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis have mainly depended on
unconventional monetary policies. As fears rise of yet another
international **[financial crisis, [there are]{.mark} growing [concerns
about]{.mark} the increased possibility of [large-scale military
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}**. More worryingly, in the current
political landscape, prolonged **[[economic crisis]{.mark}, combined
with rising economic inequality, chauvinistic ethno-populism as well as
aggressive jingoist rhetoric, including threats, [could easily spin out
of control]{.mark} and 'morph' [into]{.mark} military conflict, and
worse, [world war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Crisis responses limited The
2008-2009 global financial crisis almost 'bankrupted' governments and
caused systemic collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the world economy
from the brink, but soon switched from counter-cyclical fiscal efforts
to unconventional monetary measures, primarily 'quantitative easing' and
very low, if not negative real interest rates. But while these monetary
interventions averted realization of the worst fears at the time by
turning the US economy around, they did little to address underlying
economic weaknesses, largely due to the ascendance of finance in recent
decades at the expense of the real economy. Since then, despite
promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously pursued, let alone
achieved, such needed reforms. Instead, ostensible structural reformers
have taken advantage of the crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts
to further 'casualize' labour markets. This lack of structural reform
has meant that the unprecedented liquidity central banks injected into
economies has not been well allocated to stimulate resurgence of the
real economy. From bust to bubble Instead, easy credit raised asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008. US house
prices are now 8% more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006,
while its price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in
2008 and in 1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great
Depression. As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another
economic crisis --- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy
has become less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions --- is
considered likely. A decade of such unconventional monetary policies,
with very low interest rates, has greatly depleted their ability to
revive the economy. The implications beyond the economy of such
developments and policy responses are already being seen. **[Prolonged
economic distress has worsened public antipathy towards the culturally
alien --- not only abroad, but also within]{.underline}**. **[Thus,
another round of [economic stress is]{.mark} deemed [likely to foment
unrest]{.mark}, conflict, even war as it is blamed on the
foreign]{.underline}**. [**International trade shrank by two-thirds**
within half a decade after the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in
1930]{.underline}, at the start of the Great Depression, ostensibly to
protect American workers and farmers from foreign competition!
Liberalization's discontents **[Rising economic insecurity, inequalities
and deprivation are expected to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic
nationalist sentiments, and increase social tensions and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened]{.underline}**. Thus, **[ethno-[populist]{.mark} inspired
chauvinistic [nationalism may exacerbate tensions, leading to
conflicts]{.mark} and tensions [among countries, as in the
1930s]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Opportunistic leaders have been blaming
such misfortunes on outsiders and may seek to reverse policies
associated with the perceived causes, such as 'globalist' economic
liberalization. Policies which successfully check such problems may
reduce social tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and
conflict, including among countries. However, these may also
inadvertently exacerbate problems. The recent spread of
anti-globalization sentiment appears correlated to slow, if not negative
per capita income growth and increased economic inequality. To be sure,
globalization and liberalization are statistically associated with
growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism. Declining real
incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently strengthened
ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening economic
liberalization itself, both within and among countries. Insecurity,
populism, conflict Thomas Piketty has argued that a sudden increase in
income inequality is often followed by a great crisis. Although
causality is difficult to prove, with wealth and income inequality now
at historical highs, this should give cause for concern. Of course,
other [factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and international
tensions, with some due to policies intended for other
purposes]{.underline}. Nevertheless, **[[even if unintended]{.mark},
such [developments could inadvertently catalyse]{.mark} future crises
and [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Publics often have good reason
to be restless, if not angry, but the emotional appeals of
ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are leading to chauvinistic
policy measures which only make things worse. At the international
level, despite the world's unprecedented and still growing
interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being eschewed as
the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist policies
without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual allies.
Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg Thus, protracted economic distress,
economic conflicts or another financial crisis could lead to military
confrontation by the protagonists, even if unintended]{.underline}. Less
than a decade after the Great Depression started, the Second World War
had begun as the Axis powers challenged the earlier entrenched colonial
powers. They patently ignored Thucydides' warning, in chronicling the
Peloponnesian wars over two millennia before, when the rise of Athens
threatened the established dominance of Sparta! Anticipating and
addressing such possibilities may well serve to help avoid otherwise
imminent disasters by undertaking pre-emptive collective action, as
difficult as that may be. The international community has no excuse for
being like the owners and captain of the Titanic, conceitedly convinced
that no iceberg could possibly sink the great ship.

### 1AC Advantage -- Democracy

#### U.S. security cooperation with NATO is key to broader leadership in Europe -- solo European action causes divergence and diplomatic disengagement

James B. **Steinberg '3**, "An Elective Partnership: Salvaging
Transatlantic Relations," BROOKINGS,
https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/steinberg20030601.pdf

Finally, they note that [[NATO has been the **predicate** for US
on-going involvement in European security affairs]{.mark} and that
[diminishing NATO's role as the **preferred forum** for]{.mark}
US--European **[security cooperation]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} inevitably
[lead to US **disengagement from Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those
who argue for a new approach see the flip side to each of those
arguments. First, they note that NATO has played a limited role in
nonEuropean security issues, particularly those with a political
dimension. Second, they argue that the evolution of the EU -- in
particular, its efforts to develop common foreign, security and defence
policies -- requires the EU member states increasingly to develop common
positions among themselves. A larger forum of 19 (and rather soon, 26)
member states not only fails to reflect this EU evolution, but tends to
undermine European integration in the security realm. Third, they argue
that the expansion of NATO and its ancillary bodies dilute the core
US--European cooperation through the involvement of peripheral
countries, such as states in the Caucasus and Central Asia, that share
neither our values nor our interests. On the question of military
effectiveness, they point to the lengthy and ultimately successful
discussions that arrived at a blueprint -- the so-called 'Berlin Plus'
arrangements -- for assuring that military cooperation can take place
across the NATO--EU boundary. Finally, they insist that new US--EU links
can provide an alternative basis for US engagement in Europe.

There is no unambiguously right conclusion to this debate. But the
weight of argument would appear to favour retaining a core role for
NATO, suitably rebalanced to meet the [[new
missions]{.underline}]{.mark} and the new political realities of
European integration. The agreements reached at the Prague Summit
[[indicate]{.mark} a recognition on both sides of the Atlantic of the
[continuing importance of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[transatlantic
security cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, based on the participation
of each sovereign government, not two blocs (the European Union and
United States). This perspective is reinforced by the largely
overlapping processes of NATO and EU enlargement.15 Moreover, most new
EU members are more 'transatlantic' in orientation than many of the
older members.

So long as the security dimension of the EU remains intergovernmental
and largely based on consensus rather than majority voting, [there is no
deep tension between the NATO format and the EU's own processes.
Moreover, [the established military dimensions of cooperation would be
difficult to replicate without NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conversely, [a
[diminished reliance on NATO]{.mark} as an institution, particularly in
dealing with global security challenges, [would]{.mark} push the United
States more and more toward the strategy of 'coalitions of the willing',
[diminish]{.mark}ing [Europe's influence]{.mark} and [enhancing the
chances that the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and
Europe would take divergent approaches, to the detriment of
both]{.mark}]{.underline}.

<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2016/04/25/the-u-s-cant-afford-to-end-its-global-leadership-role/>

The economic, political and security strategy that the United States has
pursued for more than seven decades, under Democratic and Republican
administrations alike, is today widely questioned by large segments of
the American public and is under attack by leading political candidates
in both parties. [Many]{.underline} Americans no longer seem to value
the liberal international order that the United States created after
World War II and sustained throughout the Cold War and beyond. Or
perhaps they take it for granted and [have lost sight of the essential
role the United States plays in supporting the international
environment]{.underline} from which they benefit greatly. The
unprecedented prosperity made possible by free and open markets and
thriving international trade; [[the **spread of democracy**;
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[avoidance of major conflict among great
powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**: All these remarkable accomplishments
[[have]{.mark} [depended on **sustained U.S. engagement**]{.mark} around
the world]{.underline}. Yet politicians in both parties dangle before
the public the vision of an America freed from the burdens of
leadership.

What these politicians don't say, perhaps because they don't understand
it themselves, is that [the price of ending our engagement would far
outweigh its costs]{.underline}. [The international order created by the
United States today faces challenges greater than at any time since the
height of the Cold War. [Rising **authoritarian powers** in]{.mark} Asia
and **[Europe]{.mark}** [threaten to **undermine the security
structures** that have kept the peace since World War
II]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia invaded Ukraine and has seized some of
its territory. In East Asia, an increasingly aggressive China seeks to
control the sea lanes through which a large share of global commerce
flows. In the Middle East, Iran pursues hegemony by supporting Hezbollah
and Hamas and the bloody tyranny in Syria. The Islamic State controls
more territory than any terrorist group in history, brutally imposing
its extreme vision of Islam and striking at targets throughout the
Middle East, North Africa and Europe. None of these threats will simply
go away. Nor will the United States be spared if the international order
collapses, as it did twice in the 20th century. In the 21st century,
oceans provide no security. Nor do walls along borders. Nor would
cutting off the United States from the international economy by trashing
trade agreements and erecting barriers to commerce.

Instead of following the irresponsible counsel of demagogues, we need to
restore a bipartisan foreign policy consensus around renewing U.S.
global leadership. Despite predictions of a "post-American world," U.S.
capacities remain considerable. The U.S. economy remains the most
dynamic in the world. The widely touted "rise of the rest"---the idea
that the United States was being overtaken by the economies of Brazil,
Russia, India and China---has proved to be a myth. The dollar remains
the world's reserve currency, and people across the globe seek U.S.
investment and entrepreneurial skills to help their flagging economies.
U.S. institutions of higher learning remain the world's best and attract
students from every corner of the globe. The political values that the
United States stands for remain potent forces for change. Even at a time
of resurgent autocracy, popular demands for greater freedom can be heard
in Russia, China, Iran and elsewhere, and those peoples look to the
United States for support, both moral and material. And [our strategic
position remains strong. [The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[has]{.mark} more than 50 **[allies and partners]{.mark}** around the
world. Russia and China between them have no more than a
handful]{.underline}.

[[The task]{.mark} ahead [is to]{.mark} play on these strengths and
[provide]{.mark} the kind of **[leadership]{.mark}** that many around
the world seek and that the American public can support]{.underline}.
For the past two years, under the auspices of the World Economic Forum,
we have worked with a diverse, bipartisan group of Americans and
representatives from other countries to put together the broad outlines
of a strategy for renewed U.S. leadership. There is nothing magical
about our proposals. The strategies to sustain the present international
order are much the same as the strategies that created it. But they need
to be adapted and updated to meet new challenges and take advantage of
new opportunities.

For instance, one prime task today is to strengthen the international
economy, from which the American people derive so many benefits. This
means passing trade agreements that strengthen ties between the United
States and the vast economies of East Asia and Europe. Contrary to what
demagogues in both parties claim, ordinary Americans stand to gain
significantly from the recently negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership.
According to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, the
agreement will increase annual real incomes in the United States by
\$131 billion. The United States also needs to work to reform existing
international institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, so
that rising economic powers such as China feel a greater stake in them,
while also working with new institutions such as the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank to ensure that they reinforce rather than
undermine liberal economic norms.

The revolution in energy, which has made the United States one of the
world's leading suppliers, offers another powerful advantage. With the
right mix of policies, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[could help allies in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline} and Asia diversify
their sources of supply [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[reduce their
vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark} to Russian manipulation. Nations such
as Russia and Iran that rely heavily on hydrocarbon exports would be
weakened, as would the OPEC oil cartel. The overall result would be a
relative increase in our power and ability to sustain the order.

#### Backsliding undermines the global liberal order, risking a laundry list of global threats including war, pandemics, and climate change

https://www.csis.org/analysis/how-democracy's-decline-would-undermine-international-order

It is rare that policymakers, analysts, and academics agree. But there
is an emerging consensus in the world of foreign policy: [[threats
to]{.mark} the stability of the current [**international order** are
rising]{.mark}. The norms, values, laws, and [institutions that have
undergirded the international system]{.mark} and governed relationships
between nations [are being gradually dismantled]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The most discussed sources of this pressure are the ascent of China and
other non-Western countries, Russia's assertive foreign policy, and the
diffusion of power from traditional nation-states to nonstate actors,
such as nongovernmental organizations, multinational corporations, and
technology-empowered individuals. Largely missing from these
discussions, however, is the specter of widespread democratic decline.
[Rising **[challenges to democratic governance]{.mark}** across the
globe [are a **major strain on the international
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but they receive far less attention in
discussions of the shifting world order.

[In the 70 years since the end of World War II, the United States has
fostered a global order dominated by states that are liberal,
capitalist, and democratic. [The **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates
[has promoted]{.mark} the spread of [**democracy** to strengthen]{.mark}
global [**norms and rules** that constitute the foundation of our
current international system]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, despite the
steady rise of democracy since the end of the Cold War, over the last 10
years we have seen dramatic reversals in respect for democratic
principles across the globe. A 2015 Freedom House report stated that the
"acceptance of democracy as the world's dominant form of
government---and of an international system built on democratic
ideals---is under greater threat than at any point in the last 25
years."

Although the number of democracies in the world is at an all-time high,
there are a number of key trends that are working to undermine
democracy. [The [**rollback of democracy** in a few influential
states]{.mark} or even in a number of less consequential ones [would
almost certainly **accelerate meaningful changes in today's global
order**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Democratic decline would]{.mark} weaken U.S. partnerships and
[erode]{.mark} an important foundation for U.S. **[cooperation
abroad]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Research demonstrates that domestic
politics are a key determinant of the international behavior of states.
In particular, [democracies are more likely to form alliances and
cooperate more fully with other democracies than with autocracies.
Similarly, [authoritarian countries have established mechanisms for
cooperation and sharing of "worst practices]{.mark}." [An increase in
authoritarian countries]{.mark}, then, would provide a broader platform
for coordination that [could enable]{.mark} these countries to overcome
their divergent histories, values, and interests---factors that are
frequently cited as obstacles to the formation of [a cohesive
challenge]{.mark} to the U.S.-led international system]{.underline}.

[Recent examples support the empirical data. Democratic backsliding in
Hungary and the hardening of Egypt's autocracy under Abdel Fattah
el-Sisi have led to enhanced relations between these countries and
Russia. Likewise, democratic decline in Bangladesh has led Sheikh Hasina
Wazed and her ruling Awami League to seek closer relations with China
and Russia, in part to mitigate Western pressure and bolster the
regime's domestic standing]{.underline}.

Although none of these burgeoning relationships has developed into a
highly unified partnership, [democratic backsliding in these countries
has provided a basis for cooperation where it did not previously exist.
And while the United States certainly finds common cause with
authoritarian partners on specific issues, the depth and reliability of
such cooperation is limited]{.underline}. Consequently, further
democratic decline could seriously compromise the United States' ability
to form the kinds of deep partnerships that will be required to confront
today's increasingly complex challenges. **[[Global issues such as
climate change, migration, and violent extremism demand the coordination
and cooperation that democratic backsliding would put in
peril]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Put simply, [the United States is a less
effective and influential actor if it loses its ability to rely on its
partnerships with other democratic nations]{.underline}.

A slide toward authoritarianism could also challenge the current global
order by diluting U.S. influence in critical international institutions,
including the United Nations , the World Bank, and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). Democratic decline would weaken Western efforts
within these institutions to advance issues such as Internet freedom and
the responsibility to protect. In the case of Internet governance, for
example, Western democracies support an open, largely private, global
Internet. Autocracies, in contrast, promote state control over the
Internet, including laws and other mechanisms that facilitate their
ability to censor and persecute dissidents. Already many autocracies,
including Belarus, China, Iran, and Zimbabwe, have coalesced in the
"Likeminded Group of Developing Countries" within the United Nations to
advocate their interests.

Within the IMF and World Bank, autocracies---along with other developing
nations---seek to water down conditionality or the reforms that lenders
require in exchange for financial support. If successful, diminished
conditionality would enfeeble an important incentive for governance
reforms. In a more extreme scenario, the rising influence of autocracies
could enable these countries to bypass the IMF and World Bank all
together. For example, the Chinese-created Asian Infrastructure and
Investment Bank and the BRICS Bank---which includes Russia, China, and
an increasingly authoritarian South Africa---provide countries with the
potential to bypass existing global financial institutions when it suits
their interests. Authoritarian-led alternatives pose the risk that
global economic governance will become fragmented and less effective.

[[**Violence and instability** would]{.mark} also likely
[increase]{.mark} if more democracies give way to autocracy.
International relations literature tells us that [democracies are less
likely to fight]{.mark} wars against other democracies, suggesting that
[**interstate wars** would rise as the number of democracies
declines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, within countries that are
already autocratic, additional movement away from democracy, or an
"authoritarian hardening," would increase global instability. Highly
repressive autocracies are the most likely to experience state failure,
as was the case in the Central African Republic, Libya, Somalia, Syria,
and Yemen. In this way, [democratic decline would significantly strain
the international order because rising levels of instability would
exceed the West's ability to respond to the tremendous costs of
peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, and refugee flows]{.underline}.

[The **[U.S. and NATO must continue to strengthen its
partnership]{.mark}** as the world enters a "period of potential
instability]{.underline}," America's top uniformed leader said.

"[In my view, the world is entering a period of potential instability as
[some nations]{.mark} \... and clearly terrorist groups and perhaps some
rogue actors are seeking to undermine and challenge the existing
international order]{.underline}," Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark
Milley said. "And [they [seek to weaken the system of cooperation and
collective security]{.mark} that has been in existence for some
time]{.underline}."

Speaking July 15 in a ceremony aboard the USS Kearsarge to celebrate
NATO's newest operational headquarters, [Joint Force Command Norfolk in
Virginia, Milley emphasized [NATO's]{.mark} role in maintaining security
and called it "**[the most successful]{.mark} military [alliance in
human history]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

["[NATO is still]{.mark} very much a **[vital and critical]{.mark}**
part of our regional security framework and indeed our global security
framework]{.underline}," Milley. "In fact, in my view, [[it]{.mark}\'s
the linchpin that [holds together]{.mark} the period of **[great power
peace]{.mark}** that we are now enjoying]{.underline}."

Milley also stressed the importance of maintaining readiness and
modernizing for the future, calling them keys to ensuring the U.S. can
meet future defense challenges.

"We have to maintain the readiness of the present, we have to modernize
for the future," Milley said. "We are ready right now. Those who think
we are not are mistaken, and [any adversary that seeks to challenge the
United States military resolve will do well to respect this military and
our alliance and NATO]{.underline}."

[In particular]{.underline}, Milley stressed that [the [incorporation of
new technology will play a **vital role** in]{.mark} the military's
[readiness]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline} over the next decade and
said that technology, like precision munitions, artificial intelligence
and [**[biotechnology]{.underline}**, [will "have a **fundamental impact
on the conduct of war**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[Should the U.S. military not lean into technological advances, Milley
gave a grim warning]{.underline}.

"[There\'s a whole set of [technologies]{.mark} that [are
driving]{.mark} fundamental [change, and if]{.mark} we, [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates military, [and]{.mark} we,
**[NATO]{.mark}** as an alliance, [do not adapt and adopt these
technologies]{.mark},]{.underline} if we don\'t ... put the pedal to the
metal and do this right over the next 10 or 15 years[, **[we are
condemning a future generation]{.mark}**]{.underline} to what happened
76 years ago."

Moving forward, Milley emphasized that [continued cooperation will be a
key part of maintaining U.S. readiness]{.underline}, adding, "**[[We as
an alliance are stronger together than we are
individually]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

"[We\'re going to succeed or fail as a nation with our allies and

[The backdrop to the Brussels summit was the Alliance's 70th anniversary
meeting in London in December 2019, which showed that the organisation
was faced with a wide range of problems.]{.underline} In 2019, the
debate was dominated by different perceptions of threats and challenges,
a lack of political consultation on key issues, debate over the size of
defence budgets, and the relationship with Donald Trump, which from the
perspective of the Western European members was difficult. At that time,
the allies decided to initiate a reflection process under the leadership
of the NATO Secretary General1 Jens Stoltenberg; he set up a group of
experts who issued a report entitled United for a New Era2 in November
2020. Taking the report's proposals as well as his own conclusions into
consideration, and after consultation with the member states,
Stoltenberg presented his proposals for the NATO 2030 agenda,3 which the
allies accepted during the Brussels summit. This document will most
likely set the direction for a new NATO Strategic Concept, to be adopted
in 2022, that will replace the now outdated 2010 strategy. The starting
point of the NATO 2030 agenda is the belief that [[the Alliance
is]{.mark} once again [at a turning point]{.mark} in its history where
[it must adapt]{.mark} to a changing world -- not only to confront
Russia's continued aggressive policy, but also to find answers to the
challenges posed by the rise of China.]{.underline} The allies thus
agreed that they should first of all intensify their political
consultations. NATO is to become a platform for extended political
dialogue. In strategic terms, the organisation is primarily betting on
deterrence and defence. In view of the growing uncertainty in
international relations, the allies agreed to fulfil the financial
commitments made in 2014 to spend 2% of their GDP on defence and 20% of
their annual defence budgets on new arms and military equipment. NATO
will also ideally refrain from conducting any major crisis response
operations during the current decade. This is symbolised by the planned
withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan and the end of the largest
out-of-area 'Resolute Support' operation, following the US decision to
withdraw its troops from that country. However, NATO will continue to
engage in training and capacity building in partner countries in the
wider European neighbourhood.

[[NATO wants to play a larger role in]{.underline}]{.mark} improving the
resilience of its member states, [investing in **[e]{.mark}**merging and
**[d]{.mark}**isruptive **[t]{.mark}**echnologies in
[defence]{.mark}]{.underline}, adapting to climate change, and upholding
the rules-based international order. On the first of these issues, in
2016 the allies decided to adopt seven baseline requirements for
national resilience with regard to the following areas: continuity of
government and critical government services; the ability to deal
effectively with uncontrolled movements of people; the ability to deal
with mass casualties; ensuring the resilience of energy supplies; of
food and water resources; of civil communications systems; and of
transport systems.4 At the Brussels summit they made a strengthened
commitment to resilience, extending the areas above to include the
diversification of supply chains, as well as the resilience of critical
infrastructure (on land, at sea, in space and in cyberspace) and key
industries.5 [The [development of]{.mark} emerging and disruptive
[tech]{.mark}nologies [is to be facilitated]{.mark} by]{.underline} the
planned creation of a civil-military Defence Innovation Accelerator
(DIANA) and a multinationally-funded [NATO]{.underline} Innovation Fund
to invest in start-ups working on dual-use and emerging & disruptive
technologies. [[NATO wants to invest in]{.mark} the following
areas:]{.underline} artificial intelligence, data and computing,
autonomy, quantum-enabled technologies,
**[[biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}** and human enhancements,
hypersonic technologies, and space.6 The allies have also adopted a
Climate Change and Security Action Plan. NATO wants to analyse the
impact of climate change on the security environment, and on allied
installations, missions and operations; adapt accordingly, and
contribute to the mitigation of climate change by reducing greenhouse
gas emissions from the military.

#### Security cooperation is key to durable solvency -- NATO won't say yes to substitutions

**Cooper 21-** Senior fellow with the Atlantic Council and former
assistant secretary at the Department of State (R. Clarke. "American
security cooperation needs an 'integrity check'". *Atlantic Council,*
September 24, 2021,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/american-security-cooperation-needs-an-integrity-check/)//zd

Now, [treaty [allies and partner nations are reassessing their]{.mark}
bilateral security [relationships with the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}. It's not just the NATO states caught
off-guard by the haphazard departure from Afghanistan that will think
twice before embarking upon future military campaigns with the United
States. Resolute defense partners in the Middle East and the
Indo-Pacific---including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan---likely also need overt reassurance, such as a clear
national-security strategy and declared recommitments.

Additionally, these partners are increasingly feeling the need to
proactively raise their own defense capabilities by boosting their
budgets or coordinating with allies to ensure regional security along
with the United States.

Besides stress-testing the integrity of American security cooperation,
[the [Afghanistan]{.mark} withdrawal also [highlights the necessity
of]{.mark} staying the course on [long-term investment]{.mark} in
mutually beneficial security partnerships with countries with which the
United States has shared interests---or shared threats.]{.underline}
Well before the fall of Afghanistan, foreign partners were already
questioning the reliability of the United States at a time when the
debate in Washington about our global posture was becoming increasingly
politicized.

[The case for [partnering with the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [needs to be **clearly articulated** through]{.mark}
the presence, performance, and processes of American **[security
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The quality of US aerospace and
defense equipment, the commitment to build capabilities, and the
reassurance that comes from partnering with the US military must include
further transparency, accountability, and predictability of policies.

[[If not]{.mark}, American [allies and partners will be **hesitant to
collaborate**]{.mark} with us]{.underline} on future shared security
requirements---[or simply seek cooperation elsewhere]{.underline}.

We owe it to our fellow Americans, as well as to allies and partners, to
be candid about the costs of security and what it takes to support our
shared values of the rule of law, civil society, and human rights. As we
await the outcome of the Global Posture Review, or a revised
Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, anti-democratic adversaries in
Beijing and Moscow are aggressively exploiting each disruption
associated with the Taliban takeover in Kabul.

If alliances are indeed our "greatest asset"---whether in the Middle
East, Indo-Pacific, Africa, or Europe---[[it is crucial for US officials
to actively affirm]{.mark} their values through **[clear
recommitments]{.mark}** and presence [in **security
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the recent pledges made to
Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelenskyy.

We would be naïve to believe that countries around the world have no
choice but to partner with the United States. [Washington must be
deliberate in its efforts to prove why choosing the United States as a
security partner remains the best option]{.underline}.

#### Their DA is not unique -- U.S. is doing biotech already, top DOD priority

**Du '21-** Author for the National Defense Magazine (Eric. "Keeping
Chinese Funding out of U.S. Biotech". *National Defense Magazine,*
November 17, 2021,
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2021/11/17/keeping-chinese-funding-out-of\--us-biotech)//zd

[[Biotech]{.mark}nology [is one of the Defense Department's top]{.mark}
modernization [priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [it is]{.mark}
often [considered]{.mark} to be [the industry of the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Likewise, China is aggressively competing for primacy in this
sector]{.underline} by pouring more than \$100 billion into its domestic
enterprises and foreign investments. In Beijing's "Military-Civil Fusion
Strategy," the People's Liberation Army has the lead role in exploiting
and weaponizing biotechnology for its offensive capabilities, including
"specific ethnic genetic attacks."

[How can the U.S. government maintain biotechnological preeminence and
leverage the world's most innovative private sector?]{.underline}
Operation Warp Speed may provide a clue. It mobilized national biotech
resources to rapidly acquire and deploy COVID-19 vaccines. Its success
can be attributed to many factors.

[One that needs special attention is the expanded use of other
transaction authority acquisition agreements.]{.underline} About 80
percent of Operation Warp Speed's funding was obligated through OTAs,
with the rest using more traditional Federal Acquisition
Regulations-based contracts.

[Are OTAs the best way for the department to acquire biotech
capabilities compared to traditional acquisition pathways? The short
answer is, "yes --- for now."]{.underline} However, there are more
strategic policy tools that need to be implemented for full benefit.

What exactly is the other transaction authority? OTA is an authority
given to the government in 10 USC 2371b to carry out certain research,
prototype and production projects. They are neither contracts, grants,
nor cooperative agreements, and they are not subject to many rules
prescribed under FAR. OTAs allow the government to incorporate more
flexible and business-oriented terms that can reflect the commercial
world's best practices, which theoretically should make these programs
more agile and efficient compared to traditional acquisitions.

Though originated in the 1950s, the use of OTA has only started to
increase since the passage of the 2015 National Defense Authorization
Act, which permanentized the Defense Department's other transaction
authority, and modified the definition of nontraditional defense
contractor.

A major advantage of OTA is that it encourages the department to work
with nontraditional defense contractors. That includes most of the
companies in emerging technology sectors, such as biotech. OTAs also
allow for non-competitive, follow-on production contracts with the
department.

One major challenge the commercial industry has with the government
during the acquisition process is the ownership of intellectual property
and various rights for the government to march in and intervene, as
granted in the Bayh-Dole Act. OTAs often address it by eliminating or
reducing provisions of Bayh-Dole, thus incentivizing companies to make
high-risk ventures with the Defense Department.

In fiscal year 2019, OTAs accounted for 18 percent of the department's
total research-and-development portfolio, a stark increase from 3
percent in 2015. In dollar amount, OTA obligations increased from \$0.7
billion to \$7.4 billion, a 712 percent increase. According to a Center
for Strategic and International Studies analysis, 63 percent of defense
OTA obligations went toward "advanced component development and
prototypes" --- a phase to evaluate integrated technologies,
representative models, or prototype systems in high fidelity and
realistic operating environments --- akin to Phase 1 and 2 clinical
trials in the biotech realm.

In the first half of fiscal year 2020 when Operation Warp Speed had
taken full effect, the dollar amount of OTAs was roughly 1.6 times the
combined amount of OTAs from 2015-2019.

[[The pandemic helped bring the U.S. government's attention to
biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}. A notable example of OTA in biotech is
Gilead Science's remdesivir --- now branded Veklury --- an antiviral
medication for COVID-19 treatment. The drug development program had
started out in the early 2000s with the intention to treat Hepatitis C.
In 2016, the Army and Gilead signed a prototyping OTA to evaluate
remdesivir's efficacy against Ebola, and the Army would contribute up to
\$50 million to support animal testing.

cognitive and biological sciences, robotics, and
nanotechnology]{.underline} \[emphasis added\]...[[The most destructive
periods of history tend to be those when the means of aggression have
gained the upper hand in the art of waging war]{.mark}.]{.underline}3

That passage conceptually highlights [the uncertainty, complexity, and
issues of interdependence that exist in trying to understand the
interactions between emerging technologies and international
security]{.underline}. Predicting how these new innovations and
breakthroughs in scientific understanding may be used is a challenge.
Looking to history is one valuable past insight. One must be careful,
however, to not be purely technologically deterministic. That is to not
assume that because something is possible, or because something
potentially may come about, that it is inevitable. History shows us that
human ingenuity and use is more often a function of political decisions,
regional security threats, and other factors of social, political,
historical, economic, and cultural origin.

[While the suggestion that such emerging technologies will enable a new
class of weapons that will alter the geopolitical landscape---including
questions of challenging or changing strategic
stability]{.underline}---remains to be realized, [a number of
[unresolved security puzzles underlying the emergence of]{.mark} these
[new tech]{.mark}nology areas [have implications for]{.mark} U.S.
national security, defense policy, [foreign policy]{.mark}, governance,
and arms control regimes.]{.underline} The extent to [which these
emerging technologies may exacerbate or mitigate the global security and
governance challenges that Russia currently poses and will pose in the
future to the United States and NATO allies will be
examined.]{.underline}

[[As the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [looks to the
future---whether dominated by extremist groups co-opting advanced
weapons]{.mark} in the world of globalized non-state actors [or
states]{.mark} engaged in persistent regional conflicts in areas of
strategic interest---new adversaries and [new science and]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nology [will emerge]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Choices]{.mark}
made today that affect science and technology will [impact how]{.mark}
ably the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [can and will

which security operations are planned and conducted impacts S&T policy
choices made today and affects how S&T may play a beneficial or
deleterious role in the future. Some game-changing technologies have
received global attention, while others may be less well known; these
new technologies and discoveries may significantly alter military
capabilities and may generate new threats against military and civilian
sectors.

Future trend analysis is a tricky task. Colin Gray said, "Trend spotting
is easy. It is the guessing as to the probable meaning and especially
the consequences of trends that is the real challenge."4 [How, when,
where, and in what form the shifting nature of technological progress
may bring enhanced or entirely new capabilities, many of which are no
longer the exclusive domain of the United States, is contested and
requires better analytical tools to enable assessment. Contemporary
analyses of these emerging technologies often expose the tenuous links
or disconnections among the scientific and technical realities and
mainstream scholarship on national and international
security]{.underline}, especially with regard to the potential to have
impact on strategy and policy. The research underway is advancing the
strategic understanding of these game-changing technologies and the
development of meaningful and testable metrics and models to help reduce
that surprise

The report titled "Science & Technology Trends 2020--2040 Exploring the
S&T Edge NATO", published in March 2020 by the NATO S&T Organisation
(STO) is a good starting point to broach a technically complicated and
politically complex debate. The report (supported by the Alliance's
defence S&T community and NATO Allied Command Transformation -- ACT)
points to several highly interrelated areas that are considered to be
major strategic disruptors over the next 20 years: "technologies or
scientific discoveries that are expected to have a major, or perhaps
revolutionary, effect on NATO defence, security or enterprise functions
in the period 2020-2040". [Amongst the several emerging and disruptive
technologies]{.underline} (EDTs), either currently in the nascent stages
of development or undergoing rapid revolutionary development, [a few
specific examples should be mentioned]{.underline}: data analysis,
**[artificial intelligence]{.underline}** (**[AI]{.underline}**),
autonomous vehicles, new space platforms, hypersonic missiles, quantum
computer technologies, **[[biotechnology used for
defence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and new materials. These [[are at
different stages of development]{.underline}]{.mark}. Data, AI,
autonomy, space and hypersonics are already in use and are seen to be
predominantly disruptive in nature, as developments in these areas build
upon long histories of supporting technological development. As such, a
significant or revolutionary disruption of military capabilities is
either already ongoing or will have a significant impact over the next
5--10 years. New developments in quantum, biotechnology and materials
are assessed as being emergent, requiring significantly more time,
10--20 years, before their disruptive natures are fully felt on military
capabilities. Amongst the full list of the technologies named in the
report, four EDTs seem to be especially worth considering, if only
because they are already a current priority for many allies at the
national level. Autonomy and unmanned vehicles are already widely in
operational use in allied operations, but their proliferation (e.g.
cheap drones in Syria and Libya) increase vulnerabilities for allies in
asymmetrical combat and can be used in swarms to clear the way for
penetration of strike aircraft in air defence systems, supplanting the
old Wild Weasel tactics. The use of space for C4ISR, navigation and
defence is central to many of NATO's existing capabilities, and
ultimately it is the foundation upon which NATO has built a
technological edge. In the next 20 years this will imply increasingly
capable and ubiquitous C4ISR capabilities and the combination with AI
will be synergetic. On the other hand, risks from ASAT (anti-satellite)
or robotic parasitic systems will become more acute. More congested
orbits, the increased use of large constellations of small satellites
and increasing levels of space debris will impact the effectiveness and
reliability of space-based systems, impairing the Alliance capabilities.
Hypersonic technologies applied to rocket, scramjet or combined cycle
propulsion systems, are now considered a priority in the USA, China and
Russia, as well as by Japan, France, the UK, India and Australia. This
class of weapon system includes air-launched strike missiles (HCM,
Hypersonic cruise missiles), manoeuvring re-entry glide vehicles (HGV,
Hypersonic glide vehicles), land-sea ship killers, and post-stealth
strike aircraft. Countermeasures against individual, salvo or swarm
hypersonic systems are particularly challenging due to their speed and
manoeuvrability. To what degree this puts into question the existing
missile defence programmes and the existing decision cycles of
deterrence are essential debates that should, sooner or later, be opened
within the Alliance. Although new quantum technologies have the
potential for a revolutionary impact on NATO operations, most (but not
all) are in the early stages of development, and significant technical
challenges lie ahead before operational systems can be developed. The
use of ultra-sensitive gravimetric, magnetic or acoustic sensors will
significantly increase the effectiveness of underwater warfare
capabilities, potentially rendering the oceans transparent. Quantum
technologies have the potential to make stealth technologies obsolete,
provide more accurate target identification, and allow covert detection
and surveillance. Accurate clocks will enable the development of
(precision) positioning, as well as precision navigation and timing
(PNT) systems for use in GPS-denied or inaccessible areas (such as
under-ice). Unbreakable quantum key encryption will support
substantially more robust and secure communication. Quantum computing,
potentially the most disruptive quantum technology of all, has the
potential to render previously untenable classical computational tasks.
Some of the conclusions of the NATO STO study are worth quoting in full:
"\[The\] productive employment of these new technologies will pose
severe challenges and raise fundamental questions of ethics and
legality. \[...\] **[[Information itself will increasingly become a
warfighting domain and a commodity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In parallel,
the use of automated and potentially autonomous systems in operations in
which humans are not directly involved in the decision cycle, will
become more widespread and increase the pace of strategic competition".
"**[[While it is likely that the Alliance will maintain a degree of
technological advantage in some EDT areas]{.mark}, EDTs]{.underline}**
([[in particular]{.underline}]{.mark} **[AI]{.underline}**, Big Data,
**[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, hypersonic) will likely become
cheaper and **[[more accessible to hostile
actors]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The [Alliance's dependence on advanced
technology could increasingly become a liability if care is not taken on
how they are integrated and in the development of
counter-measures]{.mark}.]{.underline}** ... [It [is essential that we
understand the nature of these new technologies]{.mark}, [analyze their
implications for defence and security]{.mark}, [explore the
opportunities they offe]{.mark}r, [push the boundaries of what is
possible, and ensure that we are ready to mitigate their ris]{.mark}ks.
[NATO is by its international and collaborative nature well placed to

might prove more difficult to manage than expected. But for such a
debate to be productive, one has first to convince the decision makers

Continuing advances in [biotechnology]{.underline} provide a plethora of
opportunities to address global challenges such as the spread of
infectious diseases, food insecurity, and environmental degradation.
However, the same technologies [can be deployed by nefarious actors or
hostile states to create deadly pathogens]{.underline} that can
deliberately cause human infections, negatively target agricultural
supply chains, or disrupt existing ecological balances. [The world has
already seen some troubling historical precedents of the deliberate
misuse of biotechnology to develop bioweapons, instances of accidental
releases of living organisms from labs, and cases of laboratory-acquired
infections]{.underline}.

#### Bioweapons can cause extinction.

**Casadevall 12** (The future of biological warfare, Arturo Casadevall,
MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY & IMMUNOLOGY BLOOMBERG DISTINGUISHED PROFESSOR
ALFRED & JILL SOMMER PROFESSOR AND CHAIR PROFESSOR,
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3815869/, 6-27-22) -JV

**[In considering the importance of biological warfare as a subject for
concern it is worthwhile to review the known existential
threats]{.underline}**. At this time this writer **[can
identify]{.underline}** at three **[major existential
threats]{.underline}** to humanity: (i) large‐scale thermonuclear war
followed by a nuclear winter, (ii) a planet killing asteroid impact and
(iii) **[infectious disease]{.underline}**. To this trio might be added
climate change making the planet uninhabitable. Of the three existential
threats the first is deduced from the inferred cataclysmic effects of
nuclear war. For the second there is geological evidence for the
association of asteroid impacts with massive extinction (Alvarez, 1987).
As to an existential threat from microbes recent decades have provided
unequivocal evidence for the ability of certain pathogens to cause the
extinction of entire species. Although infectious disease has
traditionally not been associated with extinction this view has changed
by the finding that **[a single chytrid fungus was responsible for the
extinction of numerous amphibian species]{.underline}** (Daszak et al.,
1999; Mendelson et al., 2006). Previously, **[the view that infectious
diseases were not a cause of extinction was predicated on the notion
that many pathogens required their hosts and that some proportion of the
host population was naturally resistant. However, that calculation does
not apply to microbes that are acquired directly from the environment
and have no need for a host, such as the majority of fungal pathogens.
For those types of host--microbe interactions it is possible for the
pathogen to kill off every last member of a species without harm to
itself, since it would return to its natural habitat upon killing its
last host. Hence, from the viewpoint of existential threats
environmental microbes could potentially pose a much greater threat to
humanity]{.underline}** than the known pathogenic microbes, which number
somewhere near 1500 species (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al.,
2001), especially if some of these species acquired the capacity for
pathogenicity as a consequence of natural evolution or bioengineering.

#### Bioterror causes extinction.

**Cooper '13** \[Joshua Cooper, 1/23/13, University of South Carolina,
"Bioterrorism and the Fermi Paradox,"
<http://people.math.sc.edu/cooper/fermi.pdf>\] 

This is a perfect recipe for bioterrorism, and, given the many very
natural pathways for its development and the overwhelming evidence that
precisely this course has been taken by humanity, it is hard to see how
bioterrorism does not provide a neat, if profoundly unsettling, solution
to Fermi's paradox. One might object that, **[if]{.underline}**
omnicidal **[individuals are]{.underline}** [**successful in releasing
highly** [virulent and deadly genetic malware]{.mark}]{.underline} into
the wild, they are still unlikely to succeed in killing everyone.
However, even if every such mass death event results only in a high
(i.e., not total) kill rate and there is a large gap between each such
event (so that individuals can build up∂ the requisite scientific
infrastructure again), **[extinction would be inevitable]{.underline}**
regardless. Some of the engineered bioweapons will be more successful
than others; the inter-apocalyptic eras will vary in length; and
post-apocalyptic∂ **[\[as\] environments may be so war-torn,
disease-stricken, and impoverished of genetic variation [that they may
culminate in true extinction events even if the initial cataclysm 'only'
results in 90% death rates]{.mark}]{.underline}**, since they may cause
the effective population size to dip below the so-called "minimum viable
population." This author ran a Monte Carlo simulation using as
(admittedly very crude and poorly informed, though arguably
conservative) estimates the following Earth-like parameters:
bioterrorism event mean death rate 50% and standard deviation 25% (beta
distribution), initial population 1010, minimum viable population 4000,
individual omnicidal act probability 10−7 per annum, and population
growth rate 2% per annum. One thousand trials yielded an∂ average
post-space-age time until extinction of less than 8000 years. This is
essentially instantaneous on a cosmological scale, and varying the
parameters by quite a bit does nothing to make the survival period
comparable with the age of the universe.

### China biotech hegemony rising

#### China is making advances in technology and restructuring military -- threatens U.S. hegemony

**Kania**, Adjunct Senior Fellow with the Technology and National
Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, 11-3-**19**
(Elsa, 11-3-19, "Minds at War,"  *National Defense University,* p. 89,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/26864278>, accessed 6-25-2022, , FLC

Although [[technological advantage has been a **key pillar of U.S.
military power** and national competitiveness, **China is catching up,
aspiring to take the lead**]{.mark} in today's strategic
technologies]{.underline}. [Pursuing military innovation as a priority
and national imperative, [the Chinese]{.mark} military appears to be
enthused with the possibility that today's RMA [could disrupt
the]{.mark} future [military balance to its
advantage]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today, China possesses a stronger
technological foundation for future military power, despite confronting
continued challenges in the development of "key and core" (关键核心)
technologies, and [[the PLA is looking to]{.mark} improve its capacity
to [leverage]{.mark} academic and commercial advancements to enable
future military capabilities, including artificial intelligence,
**[biotechnology]{.mark}**, and quantum technology.]{.underline}

The PLA is greatly concerned about being subject to technological
surprise and equally concerned with opportunities to achieve it. Future
primacy in these fields, which could prove important to future military
advantage, may remain highly contested between the United States and
China. However, the process of military innovation that is required to
operationalize these capabilities will prove inherently challenging, and
the feasibility of certain aspects of the PLA's strategic thinking and
theoretical explorations remains to be seen. Of course, these
technologies remain quite nascent, and the process of research,
development, experimentation, and operationalization that is required to
realize their full potential may be lengthy and complex, requiring
adjustments that are challenging for any bureaucracy.

However[, [the PLA]{.mark} today [is fighting to
innovate]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is striking that [the PLA has
introduced major changes and reforms to its military]{.mark} scientific
enterprise,]{.underline} including through efforts to recruit and
support more junior scientists, while also recruiting more civilians for
technical positions. The prominence of military scientists in PLA
leadership may also provide powerful champions for this agenda.
Ultimately, Xi Jinping's demand that the PLA pursue innovation could
serve as a powerful impetus for peacetime innovation, [even as the
ideological constraints upon an authoritarian military that is de facto
the armed wing of the Chinese Communist Party could impede creativity
and initiative]{.underline}. The future trajectory of these concepts and
potential capabilities will merit continued analytic and academic
attention as such research progresses.

#### China biotech growing fast

**Senior '21** (Melanie Senior; Experienced biopharmaceutical analyst,
"China at the threshold"
\[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-021-00973-w#auth-Melanie-Senior\]
Accessed 6/27/22, TR)

[[Behind the record-breaking numbers is a force that will endure]{.mark}
into 2021 and beyond: [the **rise of China's**]{.mark} **innovative
[biotech sector]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Chinese companies accounted
for over a third of global biotech IPOs]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2020, up
from a quarter the previous year. China's stock exchanges hosted six of
the top ten largest IPOs globally (Fig. 1 and Table 2). Western
regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are
starting to welcome Chinese-developed products. Put that together with a
growing domestic market that is increasingly receptive to innovative
therapies, and [the landscape for global **biotech** is radically
**changing**]{.underline}.

Chinese healthcare is no longer only about domestic manufacturing,
state-owned enterprises and traditional medicines or copycat Western
drugs. [A **fast-growing** cohort of **Chinese biotechs** is developing
differentiated medicines, not just for the large and increasingly
innovation-friendly home market, but for the United States and other
Western nations.]{.underline} FDA officials are increasingly willing to
accept drug data gathered in China. The first China-developed cancer
drug, BeiGene's Brukinsa (zanubrutinib, an oral small-molecule Bruton's
tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor for mantle cell lymphoma), was approved
in the United States in late 2019; a handful of others have received FDA
Fast Track or Breakthrough designation or are approaching submission.

[[**Investment** in Chinese biotech reflects its growing global
relevance]{.mark}. The **\$8 billion** raised in stock exchange listings
by Chinese biotechs easily overshadowed European companies' \$1.3
billion]{.underline} haul. Most of the Europeans' money was raised on
Nasdaq rather than on domestic exchanges---Germany's mRNA vaccine maker
CureVac secured one of the country's largest IPOs on Nasdaq in August
2020 (Box 2). Nasdaq's large specialist investor base continues to
attract the most innovative companies wherever they are based.

[China's **momentum** has **continued** into 2021]{.underline}. The
country was home to three of the top ten biotech IPOs in the first four
months of the year. Two Chinese companies, Taicang-based Connect
BioPharma and Suzhou-based cell therapy player Gracell Biotechnologies,
made the top ten Nasdaq biopharma IPOs during the period (Table 3).

Some of China's new biotechs are set up to serve and provide Western
partners with access to the world's second-largest biopharma market
(Table 4). Amgen has established a 20.5% stake in the Chinese sector
flagship BeiGene in Beijing. Shanghai-based JW Therapeutics was
co-founded by Juno Therapeutics (now part of Bristol Myers Squibb) and
contract research organization WuXi AppTec to develop cellular
immunotherapies for Chinese patients. JW's lead product, relmacabtagene
autoleucel, an anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy for relapsed or refractory
B-cell lymphoma, has priority review and hopes to be the first such
cellular therapy on the local market. JW raised over \$335 million in a
November 2020 IPO in Hong Kong---only narrowly outside the top ten
global biotech listings. In May 2020, Pfizer invested \$200 million in
five-year-old CStone Pharmaceuticals, accessing late-stage product
sugemalimab (an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) targeting programmed cell
death 1 ligand, or PD-L1) and obtaining a development and marketing
partner for other oncology drugs in China.

[But for many innovation-focused Chinese biotechs and their investors,
**the domestic market isn't enough**]{.underline}. Healthcare coverage,
while growing, remains limited. Prices are low. Programmed death-1
(PD-1) inhibitors for cancer---among the first targeted medicines to be
reimbursed on China's National Drug Reimbursement List, in 2019---now
cost up to 80% less than in the United States. That's in part because
several market entrants have created price competition, but even a
first-in-class drug could not command anything near US prices. In per
capita income terms, China remains a poor country.

Hence [**[China's biotechs need to go global]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
"We've never designed \[targeted therapies\] only for China," says
Christian Hogg, CEO of Hong Kong--based Hutchmed (formerly Hutchison
China MediTech). The company was among the first biotechs to set up in
China, in 2000, back when "there was not biotech sector at all," recalls
Hogg. Hutchmed sells two drugs in China: Elunate (fruquintinib), a
selective small-molecule inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor
receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2 and 3 for metastatic colorectal cancer (partnered
with Eli Lilly); and Sulanda (surufatinib), a selective small-molecule
inhibitor of VEGFR, fibroblast growth factor receptor and colony
stimulating factor-1 receptor for advanced non-pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors. It is now building its US commercial infrastructure, using some
of the \$300 million raised via private investments in public equity
(PIPEs) over the past 12 months. The company is dual listed on Nasdaq
and AIM in the United Kingdom. Sulanda completed its rolling submission
to the US FDA in May 2021 and a global phase 3 trial of Elunate is
underway.

Over the past two decades, **[[China has vaulted to the top ranks of
biotech]{.mark} basic research]{.underline}**. From 2007-2017, China's
biotech publications increased by 20% annually, with the second most
publications after the U.S.103 In 2019 and 2020, China [overtook Germany
and the U.K.]{.underline} respectively and [now ranks second in the
Nature Index for high-quality life sciences research]{.underline},
increasing its annual output by 9% over the past year.104 Notably, its
research output has exceeded America's in multiple areas, including in
CRISPR-modified crops (42% vs. 19% share) and transgenic plants (30% vs.
12% share). [[China]{.mark} also [produces the most biotech
patents]{.mark} annually]{.underline}, increasing its global share from
1% in 2000 to 28% in 2019 while the U.S. share dropped from 45% to
27%.105 In biomedical patents, [[China's annual growth rate of 16% far
exceeds America's 3%]{.underline}]{.mark}, and in cell therapy patents
[China leads in both total patents and growth rate]{.underline}.106
[Where [China]{.mark} lags in basic research, it [has excelled in
developing applications]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consider genomics and
genomic technology as a representative arena. While the U.S. led the
world in coordinating and completing the Human Genome Project at the
start of the millennium, China in 2018 launched the world's largest
genome project, which project director Dr. Wang Yadong stated will "map
out \[the\] Chinese people's genome atlas by sequencing the genes of
100,000 individuals, in an effort to identify \[the\] genetic basis of
health disorders of Chinese."107 After acquiring U.S.-based Complete
Genomics in 2013, [Chinese genomics giant BGI is now the world's largest
genetics research center and can sequence human genomes for a
record-breaking \$100 (6 times less expensive than its competitors and
100,000 times cheaper than the cost in 2000]{.underline}).108 In CRISPR
research, the U.S. maintains a lead in total papers published, but this
lead is much narrower for recent years. [In 2018, the U.S. published 898
papers and China published 824.109]{.underline} More notably, that same
year, Chinese scientist He Jiankui crossed a bioethical red line when he
used CRISPR to create the world's first genetically-modified babies.
Although He was later criticized for violating Chinese and international
bioethical standards, this case was nonetheless reflective of China's
looser regulations around CRISPR applications, which have allowed
China's human studies to far outpace those in the United States, with
half of all CRISPR clinical trials taking place in China.1

Conclusion. [[China]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates today each [generate at **least 2 percent of GDP from
biotechnology**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Both]{.underline}]{.mark}
countries [[are looking for more]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The combination
of [biological]{.mark} [engineering]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [[biomanufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[constitutes a]{.mark} flexible and [powerful technology]{.mark}
[platform]{.mark}]{.underline}, mastery of which is critical to the
physical and economic security of both China and the United States,
whether separated or cooperating, in the twenty-first century.
[While]{.underline} a crude assessment of sector revenues may lead to
the conclusion that [the United States is presently in the
lead]{.underline} technologically, [**[the]{.mark} [ongoing digital
transformation]{.mark}** of biological engineering **[will accelerate
the progress of whoever successfully develops]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[**[and]{.underline}** **[implements these tools]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
China has made surpassing US capabilities in biological engineering a
central pillar of its twenty-first century industrial strategy, and the
government is investing in a long-term program to accomplish that goal.
While "decoupling" has become a buzzword in the US policy circles over
the last three years, it is also emerging from policy proposals in
China. President Xi Jinping has placed increasing emphasis on increasing
indigenous innovation, and his government in essence "seeks to ringfence
the entire innovation ecosystem."107 One question policymakers on both
sides must consider is to what extent either country is in a position to
sustain "ring-fenced" indigenous innovation, and in what areas, or
whether that isolation will lead to stagnation. Moreover, we must also
ask whether decoupling direct connections in biotechnology between the
two economies would result in meaningful separation, or whether capital,
trade, and information might still continue to flow between the
countries via a third nation or global network. [Any proposal to
decouple the two economies should include metrics to measure the
benefits, and costs, of implementation to ensure that the position and
interests of the United States are indeed improved by such a
move]{.underline}. For example, [it would appear that China would be
harmed in the short term by decoupling]{.underline} because China's
commercialization efforts depend on importing early innovation, despite
claims to the contrary. Yet the US lead in biotechnology is fragile and
will wither without diligent effort. We find that, while the United
States appears to hold a lead over China, **[[the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is in danger of recapitulating in
biotechnology]{.mark} those [past practices in trade]{.mark} and IP
transfer t[hat have facilitated]{.mark}]{.underline}**, in other
domains, [[**the acceleration of China's** **technological**
**ambitions**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The United States' laissez-faire
approach to the market and to planning has its advantages but also its
costs, where the latter now negatively impact physical and economic
security. [[A]{.mark} [hands-off attitude]{.mark}]{.underline}, coupled
with a short-term focus and a complacency about China's intent to
improve its capabilities, [[now puts the US lead at risk even as
scientific exchange and trade are increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} current global [[pandemic]{.mark} has
exacerbated the already elevated political tensions between the two
countries and has [put the relationship under strain and
scrutiny]{.mark}]{.underline}. And yet this disruption can also be
viewed as an opportunity to diagnose and address these issues. A
substantial component of the present trade and security disputes between
the United States and China comprises claims and counterclaims around IP
and trade secrets. The US position is that China acquires IP and process
knowledge through unfair and illegal means, while the Chinese position
is that the United States is attempting to "contain China's rise"
through unfair and illegal means; "decoupling could be seen as
'strategic blackmail' for Washington to try to prevent China from
growing stronger."108 There is a significant difference, however,
between the United States working to prevent industrial espionage and
insisting on fair play on the one hand and intentionally containing
indigenous technological innovation to suppress the development of China
on the other. We note that accusations of the United States targeting
China specifically for containment ignore seven decades of post--World
War II global outreach and scientific exchange sponsored by the United
States through various branches of the United Nations, the OECD, and
NATO. The Soviet Union was a participant in many of these forums, even
while it was subject to restrictions on technology developed in the West
during the years when it explicitly portrayed itself as a foe and
actively sought to undermine US interests around the world. Beijing has
recently reiterated that it sees its interests in opposition to those of
Washington, while at the same time it continues to rely on research
funded by American taxpayers to supply Chinese technological
development. [This tension creates a potential strategic vulnerability
for China]{.underline}. Indeed, casting the US defense of the rule of
law and of domestic IP development as a nefarious plot to restrict
Chinese growth betrays a concern that the existing, explicit state
strategy of importing external early-stage research to support domestic
commercialization is at risk.

[Recommendations]{.underline}. **[[We should measure everything
better]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By necessity, [the quantitative economic
data presented here was gathered from disparate sources]{.underline},
[of variable quality]{.underline}, [over a period of more than a
decade]{.underline}. There is no centralized source of economic data for
biotechnology from any country, which hamstrings any effort to either
assess strengths and weaknesses or evaluate costs and benefits of
proposed policies.109 **[[The]{.mark} [US government should institute
mechanisms to measure its domestic bioeconomy and also those of rival
states]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Of particular utility would be
highquality data]{.underline} (or at least well-bounded estimates)
[describing]{.underline} ([1]{.underline}) [sector
revenues]{.underline}, ([2]{.underline}) [sector
employment]{.underline}, ([3]{.underline}) [relevant international
trade]{.underline}, ([4]{.underline}) [capital flows]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} ([5]{.underline}) [state and private investment in
R&D]{.underline}. [The ultimate goal of this measurement activity is to
improve our situational awareness]{.underline}. [We should develop the
strategy and framework for response]{.underline}. **[[The]{.mark}
[United States has begun contesting Chinese
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**---for example, by using CFIUS to reduce
IP transfers---**[[without]{.mark} necessarily [developing a framework
for understanding the contest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nor for choosing
goals, nor for developing strategies and tactics to achieve those goals.
[Such a framework needs to acknowledge that China sees itself engaged in
an existential struggle, even if we do not]{.underline}. Any strategy
must be calibrated to a time line of decades, far longer than
congressional or presidential terms, and must survive across
administrations. It must also include specific tactical policy measures
subject to near-term implementation. For example, [we suggest
that]{.underline}, at a minimum, [the US government examine the
feasibility of including contractual language in federal research
grants]{.underline} that requires approval before the export of
taxpayer-funded early-stage research and IP overseas. [Investing to
develop and maintain the lead in advanced bioengineering and
biomanufacturing will require concerted attention and
effort]{.underline}. This is not a sprint to be won, but rather **[a
[long-term competition]{.mark} that [will require continual
effort]{.mark}]{.underline}**; there is no finish line, and no time
limit. **[But [there is a]{.mark} [looming]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[exigent]{.mark}, [deadline for organizing ourselves to
compete]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[It is not an exaggeration to classify
this race as [an extension of the Great Game of international
affairs]{.mark}, because that is precisely the way our global
competitors describe it]{.underline}**. **[[We must be engaged for the
long haul]{.mark}, [and we must begin
today]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[Biotechnology could be exploited to produce "super soldiers." China
has genetically engineered beagles with three times the muscle mass of a
typical canine, a technology that could possibly be applied to humans.
Exoskeletons could provide soldiers with superhuman strength, and brain
implants promise superior cognitive performance. China employed
exoskeletons in combat in its 2020 border conflict with India. It is not
yet clear how these new technologies, when combined with novel
operational concepts, will affect the future of warfare, but it is
likely they]{.underline}** will. A future state may, for example, be
able to use additive manufacturing to produce masses of inexpensive
drones directed by new AI algorithms to swarm and overwhelm adversaries.
The attack might be preceded by cyber and counterspace attacks that
blind an adversary and disrupt its command and control. Following a
successful advance, the country could then employ directed energy
weapons, autonomous mines, and other advanced defenses to lock in
territorial gains and thwart enemy attempts to roll back its aggression.
It is possible that the first state to hone these technologies and
devise effective operational concepts will have a military edge over its
opponents.

### Hegemony solvency

#### The US needs to cooperate and establish biotech norms to combat China

Ahead of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China deployed a novel
method for selecting its athletes. According to the Chinese Ministry of
Science and Technology, Beijing sequenced the genomes of its elite
competitors to detect more than 100 markers linked to "speed, endurance,
and explosive force." It then used the results in part to determine who
would go on to represent China at the upcoming games. Beijing's
11th-place showing in the medal count suggests that the tactic didn't
work exactly as planned. Athletic success, after all, comes from a
complicated mix of constitution, training, and determination, so
advanced genetic screening may do little to predict who wins or loses.
But China's Olympic program is just one part of a larger project to
harness the power of biotechnology for strategic goals. Beijing is
currently investing trillions of dollars in everything from synthetic
biology and artificial intelligence to neuroengineering and genomic data
banks---advances that stand poised to transform how people relate to one
another and to the natural world. But China's approach to these
developments---exemplified by lax ethical standards and human rights
abuses---is deeply troubling. "The more technology we have, the more
dangerous we are to ourselves and entire humankind," explained Dr. Rao
Yi, a neurobiologist at Peking University. Unfettered by respect for
privacy, transparency, and human rights, Beijing's biotechnology efforts
could threaten the economic well-being and national security of the
United States and the global order. [**[The bioethics wars are here, but
Washington isn't ready]{.underline}**.]{.mark} For the first time since
1974, [[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is without]{.mark}
[a federal bioethics commission]{.mark} to guide policymakers and public
debate on controversial issues]{.underline}. Congress should authorize a
new commission---or President Joe Biden should sign an executive order
to create a new one. **[Simultaneously, [the United States must engage
international institutions to restore the core principles of
openness]{.mark} and justice [in the life sciences]{.mark}. [Unless it
reclaims moral leadership in this space]{.mark}, [Washington will cede
the world's biotechnology future to authoritarian regimes whose]{.mark}
secrecy and [repression]{.mark} [extend far beyond their
borders]{.mark}.]{.underline}** PLAYING WITH FIRE [[Morally fraught
experiments have flourished in China in recent
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2017, surgeons at Harbin Medical
University defied international condemnation to attempt the first human
head transplant. In 2018, a Shenzhen biophysicist implanted embryos
edited through experiments that risked introducing destructive mutations
into the human gene pool. And in 2019, China's Institute of Zoology
invited a Spanish biochemist to create human-monkey chimeras as organ
transplant sources. [These boundary-pushing developments aren't just the
work of a few bad apples. Rogue scientists are the predictable product
of a national system that reduces research oversight in Beijing to a
"rubber stamp,"]{.underline} according to recent testimony before the
World Health Organization by the Chinese medical ethicist Hu Qingli.
Indifference is part of the problem. The Chinese Ministry of Health, for
instance, ostensibly banned unauthorized stem cell therapies in 2012.
But a decade later, pop-up stem cell clinics still hawk untested
interventions to repair spinal cords and augment breasts. Corruption is
another factor. Incidents of bribery at the China Food and Drug
Administration, now known as the National Medical Products
Administration, led to mass casualties from at least six tainted drugs
meant to treat autoimmune disorders, erectile dysfunction, and other
ailments. [Then there is China's heavy-handed program of biometric
surveillance and population control. In 2018, Beijing used Islamic
terrorism as a pretext to launch the most technologically sophisticated
regime of data mining and collection that the world has ever
seen]{.underline}. Drones with facial recognition cameras hover over
regions such as Xinjiang while police at checkpoints take mandatory iris
scans, blood samples, and genetic tests from Uyghur Muslims. Beijing
exports this digital security and mass surveillance architecture to
dozens of other countries, including Egypt and Uganda, where they have
been used to persecute sexual minorities and religious dissidents.
**[[Even countries that use these tools to promote public health and
safety unwittingly supply China with]{.mark} their citizens' [biometric
information]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to a Reuters
investigation, Shenzhen-based BGI Genomics is amassing and analyzing
genetic data on women and fetuses from a noninvasive prenatal test that
the firm developed in conjunction with the Chinese military. The kit is
marketed in more than 50 countries, including Australia, Canada,
Denmark, Germany, India, Pakistan, Spain, Thailand, and the United
Kingdom. Roughly 8.4 million women have used it. One BGI study allegedly
used a military supercomputer to "map the prevalence of viruses in
Chinese women, look for indicators of mental illness in them, and single
out Tibetan and Uyghur minorities to find links between their genes and
their characteristics." [China's top-down approach to biotechnology also
has serious implications for family planning.]{.underline} The country's
now lapsed one-child policy was supposed to bring economic prosperity.
Instead, it yielded an epidemic of forced sterilizations, abortions, and
female infanticide that produced the country's current lopsided sex
ratio and aging workforce. But that experience hasn't stopped Beijing
from experimenting with new forms of genetic control. A 1995 law aimed
at "avoid\[ing\] new births of inferior quality and heighten\[ing\] the
standards of the whole population" requires couples at risk of passing
along infectious or hereditary diseases to use long-term contraceptives
or postpone marriage until after child-bearing age. In 2022, moreover,
millions of Chinese parents will use state-subsidized "talent tests" to
screen offspring for traits such as height, intelligence, memory,
extroversion, musical ability, and athletic prowess. These policies of
biological selection and enhancement extend beyond family planning. A
2016 Chinese government report, for instance, underscored the potential
value of gene editing to boost troops' combat effectiveness. Former U.S.
Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe warned in a recent Wall
Street Journal op-ed that the Chinese military is working to engineer
"soldiers with biologically enhanced capabilities"---from superstrength
to altitude sickness resistance. INNOVATE OR PERISH **[[Chinese
developments]{.mark} in biotechnology [demand a U.S. response]{.mark}.
The last national bioethics commission lapsed in 2017, and Washington
has yet to authorize a replacement. [A]{.mark} [new]{.mark}ly
established [commission]{.mark} [should engage]{.mark} with universities
and [industries to set norms and expectations around bioethics]{.mark}.
Good models for this kind of public-private collaboration already
exist]{.underline}**. Organizations such as the Secure DNA Project and
the Morningside Group---independent coalitions dedicated to safely and
fairly governing genetic synthesis and brain-computer interfaces,
respectively---are examples of what scientists, ethicists, and others
can accomplish together. Future interdisciplinary teams can act as
gatekeepers to affirm moral standards and condemn transgressions---for
instance, by determining who gets published in high-impact journals and
invited to prestigious conferences. **[[These partnerships can also help
bridge ideological differences]{.mark} on issues such as vaccine
passports, gene-edited immunity, and challenge trials that pay people to
test new therapies for COVID-19. These are debates that democratic
societies are well equipped to handle. Four of the world's biggest
democracies---Australia, India, Japan, and the United States---have
recognized the existential stakes of life sciences research and recently
pledged to collectively tackle "the critical and emerging technologies
of the future, beginning with biotechnology."]{.underline}** That work
should include establishing a global medical ethics consortium built on
international agreements such as the Universal Declaration on Bioethics
and Human Rights, treaties such as the Biological Weapons Convention,
and multilateral arrangements such as the T-12---a group of
technologically advanced democracies. **[Still, [democratic societies
can't maintain bioethical standards alone]{.mark}. Going forward,
[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and other democracies
must]{.mark} [engage]{.mark} [with]{.mark} authoritarian
[states]{.mark}, especially on areas of shared interest, including
biodiversity, climate change, and highly infectious diseases. [A natural
starting point is oversight]{.mark} to ensure that Beijing actually
implements its Biosecurity Law of 2021---legislation designed to guide
Beijing's policies on everything from bioterrorism to biotechnology.
[Washington should also focus on developing new treaty guidelines for
human experimentation and genetic-information
sharing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** THE OLYMPIC SPIRIT China's DNA-based
approach to picking its 2022 Olympic competitors may look like a
harbinger of a grim future. But the country's athletic history also
suggests a path for managing this new form of geopolitical competition.
Between 1988 and 1998, 52 Chinese Olympic athletes tested positive for
banned performance-enhancing drugs, including a half dozen gold medal
winners. In response to the resulting international outcry, the
International Olympic Committee created the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Chastened, China developed the world's most rigorous anti-doping
measures---mandating education, exams, and pledges among athletes and
coaches. Violators got lifetime bans. The Chinese state also sought to
repair its reputation, funding new research and pledging long-term
commitments to international anti-doping efforts. At the time,
verification and transparency made it possible to hold China accountable
for its ethics violations, and international pressure and the threat of
meaningful sanctions drove Beijing to act more responsibly---in sports,
anyway. Similar policies could work today in the field of bioethics,
helping rein in China's reckless behavior. In this way, Beijing's
revolutionary Olympic selection process could be the opening the world
needs to thrash out the moral status of scientific advances just over
the horizon.

The internet, microwaves, and synthetic rubber came into our lives as
products invented for military purposes. Even everyday things, such as
undershirts and concentrated fruit juice were created to improve the
combat readiness of armed forces. Though many people typically associate
the military with war and suffering, **[[this industry has been]{.mark}
a source of incredible progress,]{.underline}** **[[producing
inventions]{.mark} [that made our lives]{.mark} longer,
[healthier]{.mark}, [and easier]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[These
days]{.mark}, [innovation is likely to run the other
way]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with the military benefiting from inventions
developed with private funding. [[A symbiotic relationship]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} [military needs]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [human
progress]{.mark} [is not necessarily the default]{.mark}. Instead, [it
requires a well-oiled innovation ecosystem]{.mark} in which military and
civilian industries share their expertise and knowledge with one
another]{.underline}. [[NATO has recently announced several
initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} to build on past success, **[[but more
are needed]{.underline}]{.mark}**---**[[particularly as members increase
their military funding]{.mark}. Virtually all alliance members are
investing more in defense or are soon planning to do so.]{.underline}**
Germany, for example, declared that it would create a 100-billion-Euro
fund and reach its 2% goal in 2022. Poland, which shares the longest EU
border with Ukraine, has taken in more than 3.5 million Ukrainian
refugees and promised to dedicate 3% of its GDP to defense. Croatia
ramped up its defense investment to 2.3% of GDP. To [ensure that this
new investment spurs innovation and co-operation between military and
civilian industries]{.underline} as well as academia, NATO announced in
April the Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic. DIANA
will concentrate on deep technologies, including artificial
intelligence, big-data processing, quantum-enabled technologies,
biotechnology, novel materials, and outer space. In addition, 17 NATO
nations have agreed to set up the world's first multi-sovereign venture
capital fund. It will invest 1 billion Euros in early-stage startups and
other deep tech funds aligned with its strategic objectives. **[[But
NATO members need to do more to maintain their technological advantage
over Russia and China, who are also increasing spending on military
research and development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The trends make this
clear]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1960, the U.S. accounted for 69 percent
of global R&D investments, with U.S. defense-related R&D accounting for
no less than 36% of global spending. The bulk (65%) of U.S. investments
in defense-related R&D was financed from the federal budget. However, by
2019, the U.S. share of global R&D fell to 30%, and the share of federal
government investment in defense-related R&D fell from 65% to 21%,
whereas the share of business investment in R&D has grown from 33% to
71%. This leaves no doubt that meaningful innovation is not possible
without close co-operation with the private sector. [[As NATO
prepares]{.underline}]{.mark} to adopt its next Strategic Concept at the
summit in Madrid, **[[it is essential that it focus on mechanisms that
maintain]{.mark} [its]{.mark} [technological
advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As part of GLOBSEC's work at the
Future Security and Defense Council, we have proposed several ideas
**[[to help promote innovation in]{.mark} [the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[We are convinced that NATO's
innovation ecosystem must integrate public and private sectors to ensure
this edge]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Summary. **[[Biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, the engineering and
application of the science of biology to meet human goals, [[**is**
**critical to economic success**]{.mark} in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}. [In the United States, revenues generated by
biotechnology]{.underline} (principally drugs, crops, and chemicals)
[are **[already larger than 2 percent]{.mark}** of gross domestic
product]{.underline} and are growing approximately twice as fast as the
economy as a whole. Individuals and news articles from China describe
similarly sized biotechnology revenues there, but in both nations, the
accuracy and precision of estimates is limited by the paucity of data.
Revenues to date have been achieved using first-generation
technologies[. [Second]{.mark}-[gen]{.mark}eration
[tech]{.mark}nologie[s]{.mark} [will be more powerful]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [could supply]{.mark} up to 60 percent of]{.underline}
physical [inputs to the]{.underline} global [economy]{.underline}, with
a direct economic impact of [\$4]{.underline} [\[**[four]{.mark}**\]
**[trillion a year]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Chinese leaders have
identified biotechnology in writings and in pronouncements as critical
to their vision of China as a dominant global economic power. To that
end, they are pursuing a long-term strategy of climbing up the value
chain and using a familiar set of tactics that includes the following:
financial support for industry champions, intellectual property
licensing from abroad, infrastructure spending (laboratories, technology
parks, academic research), as well as IT hacking and industrial
espionage. By contrast, **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has
adopted a laissez-faire approach and [**[has little strategy or
policy]{.mark}** regarding biotechnology]{.underline}. The bioeconomies
of the two nations may be similar in size but are configured
differently. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [relies on
China]{.mark} for [manufacturing]{.mark}]{.underline} (for example, 75
percent of active [[pharmaceutical]{.mark}
[ingredients]{.mark}]{.underline}), for services (for example, [[DNA
sequencing]{.underline}]{.mark}), and for talented students who come to
study and work at US universities. Meanwhile, China depends on external
basic research to support a bioeconomy focused on commercialization of
innovations created elsewhere. In the short term, decoupling would be
painful for both countries. In the long term, it would be easier for the
United States to replace manufacturing capacity and academic labor than
it would be for China to find globally, or to replicate within China, a
basic research and academic infrastructure that is the equivalent to
that of the United States. There are no absolute impediments that would
prevent the United States from ultimately reducing interactions to near
zero. Instead, decoupling decisions must revolve around the cost and the
time they would require to implement. These decisions are currently
impossible to make in an informed fashion, and we therefore make two
recommendations: (**[[1]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[the US government
should measure the domestic bioeconomy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and the
bioeconomies of its rivals]{.underline}, with greater granularity and
accuracy, and (**[[2]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[the US government
should develop a framework and strategy for competing in
biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Democracy solvency

#### Cooperation between U.S. and her allies are needed to combat the threat of autocratic states

**Cohen, Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, and
Fontaine, CEO of the Center for a New American Security, '20** (Jared
Cohen and Richard Fontaine, "Uniting the Techno-Democracies", Foreign
Affairs,

Accessed 6/27/22; Analina)

[At the outset of the digital age, democracies seemed ascendant. The
United States and like-minded countries were at the cutting edge of
technological development. Policymakers were pointing to the inherently
liberalizing effect of the Interne]{.underline}t, which seemed a threat
to dictators everywhere. The United States\' technological advantage
made its military more potent, its economy more prosperous, and its
democracy, at least in theory, more vibrant.

S[ince then, autocratic states have caught up. China is at the
forefront, no longer a mere rising power in technology and now an
American peer]{.underline}. In multiple areas-including facial and voice
recognition, 5G technology, digital payments, quantum communications,
and the commercial drone market-it has surpassed the United States.
Leaders in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, and elsewhere are
increasingly using technology for illiberal ends, following China\'s
example. And despite the United States\' remaining advantage in some
technologies, such as artificial intelligence (ai) and semiconductor
production, it has fallen behind China in formulating an overall
strategy for their use.

[Almost in parallel, the United States and its allies have stepped away
from their tradition of collaboration. Instead of working together on
issues of common interest, they have been pulled apart by diverging
national interests and have responded incoherently to autocratic
states\' co-optation of new technologies.]{.underline} Although
officials in most democratic capitals now acknowledge the profound ways
in which new technologies are shaping the world, they remain strangely
disconnected from one another when it comes to managing them.
Coordination, when it occurs, is sporadic, reactive, and ad hoc.

T[he liberal democracies are running out of time to get their act
together: whoever shapes the use of emerging technologies such
as]{.underline} ai, quantum computing, [biotechnology]{.underline}, and
next-generation telecommunications [will have an economic, military, and
political advantage for decades to come]{.underline}. [But the world\'s
advanced democracies have something the autocracies don\'t: a long
history of multilateral cooperation for the benefit of all.]{.underline}

[Because the issues are so diverse, what\'s needed now is not more
piecemeal solutions but an overarching forum in which like-minded
countries can come together to hammer out joint responses]{.underline}.
[This new grouping of leading \"techno-democracies\"-call it the T-12,
given the logical list of members-would help democracies regain the
initiative in global technology competition]{.underline}. [It would
allow them to promote their preferred norms and values around the use of
emerging technologies and preserve their competitive advantage in key
areas. Above all, it would help coordinate a unified response to a chief
threat to the global order.]{.underline}

#### Who leads in the development and sale of technology will determine the future of the international order -- it's either democracy or autocracy, there is no in-between.

THE CLASH OF SYSTEMS

The history of international order building is one of savage competition
between clashing systems, not of harmonious cooperation. In the best of
times, that competition took the form of a cold war, [with each side
jockeying for advantage and probing each other with every measure short
of military force. In many cases, however, the competition eventually
boiled over into a shooting war and ended with one side crushing the
other]{.underline}. The victorious order then ruled until it was
destroyed by a new competitor---or until it simply crumbled without an
external threat to hold it together.

Today, a growing number of policymakers and pundits are calling for a
new concert of powers to sort out the world's problems and divide the
globe into spheres of influence. But the idea of an inclusive order in
which no one power's vision prevails is a fantasy that can exist only in
the imaginations of world-government idealists and academic theorists[.
There are only two orders under construction right now---a Chinese-led
one and a U.S.-led one---and the contest between the two is rapidly
becoming a clash between autocracy and democracy, as both countries
define themselves against each other and try to infuse their respective
coalitions with ideological purpose]{.underline}. [China is positioning
itself as the world's defender of hierarchy and tradition against a
decadent and disorderly West; the United States is belatedly summoning a
new alliance to check Chinese power]{.underline} and [make the world
safe for democracy]{.underline}.

[This clash of systems will define the twenty-first century and divide
the world]{.underline}. China will view the emerging democratic order as
a containment strategy designed to strangle its economy and topple its
regime. In response, it will seek to protect itself by asserting greater
military control over its vital sea-lanes, carving out exclusive
economic zones for its firms, and propping up autocratic allies as it
sows chaos in democracies. [The upsurge of Chinese repression and
aggression]{.underline}, in turn, [will further impel the United States
and its allies to shun Beijing and build a democratic
order]{.underline}. For a tiny glimpse of what this vicious cycle might
look like, consider what happened in March 2021, when Canada, the United
Kingdom, the United States, and the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials
for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The sanctions amounted to a slap on
the wrist, but Beijing interpreted them as an assault on its sovereignty
and unleashed a diplomatic tirade and a slew of economic sanctions. The
EU returned fire by freezing its proposed EU-China Comprehensive
Agreement on Investment.

In the coming years, [the trade and technology wars between China and
the United States that began during the Trump administration will rage
on]{.underline} as both sides try to expand their respective spheres.
[Other countries will find it increasingly difficult to hedge their bets
by maintaining links to both blocs]{.underline}. Instead, [China and the
United States will push their partners to pick sides]{.underline},
[compelling them to reroute their supply chains and adopt wholesale the
ecosystem of technologies and standards of one side's
order]{.underline}. [The Internet will be split in two]{.underline}.
When people journey from one order to the other---if they can even get a
visa---they will enter a different digital realm. Their phones won't
work, nor will their favorite websites, their email accounts, or their
precious social media apps. [Political warfare between the two systems
will intensify, as each tries to undermine the domestic legitimacy and
international appeal of its competitor.]{.underline} East Asian
sea-lanes will grow clogged with warships, and rival forces will
experience frequent close encounters.

The standoff will end only when one side defeats or exhausts the other.
As of now, [the smart money is on the U.S. side, which has far more
wealth and military assets than China does and better prospects for
future growth]{.underline}. [By the early 2030s, Xi, an obese smoker
with a stressful job, will be in his 80s, if he is still
alive.]{.underline} China's demographic crisis will be kicking into high
gear, with the country projected to lose roughly 70 million working-age
adults and gain 130 million senior citizens between now and then.
Hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas Chinese loans will be due,
and many of China's foreign partners won't be able to pay them back. It
is hard to see how a country facing so many challenges could long
sustain its own international order, especially in the face of
determined opposition from the world's wealthiest countries.

[Yet it is also far from guaranteed that the U.S.-led democratic order
will hold together.]{.underline} The United States could suffer a
constitutional crisis in the 2024 presidential election and collapse
into civil strife. Even if that doesn't happen, the United States and
its allies might be rent by their own divides. The democratic world is
suffering its greatest crisis of confidence and unity since the 1930s.
Nationalism, populism, and opposition to globalism are rising, making
collective action difficult. The East Asian democracies have ongoing
territorial disputes with one another. [Many Europeans view China as
more of an economic opportunity than a strategic threat and seriously
doubt the United States' reliability as an ally,]{.underline} having
endured four years of tariffs and scorn from President Donald Trump, who
could soon be back in power. Europeans also hold different views from
Americans on data security and privacy, and European governments fear
U.S. technology dominance almost as much as they do Chinese digital
hegemony. India may not be ready to abandon its traditional policy of
nonalignment and back a democratic order, especially when it is becoming
more repressive at home, and an order built around democracy will
struggle to form productive partnerships with autocracies that would be
important partners in any alliance against China, such as Singapore and
Vietnam. Fear of China is a powerful force, but it might not be potent
enough to paper over the many cracks that exist within the emerging
anti-Chinese coalition.

[If that coalition fails to solidify its international order, then the
world will steadily slide back into anarchy, a struggle among rogue
powers and regional blocs in which the strong do what they can and the
weak suffer what they must. Some scholars assum]{.underline}e---or
hope---that an unordered world will sort itself out on its own, that
great powers will carve out stable spheres of influence and avoid
conflict or that the spread of international commerce and enlightened
ideas will naturally maintain global peace and prosperity. But peace and
prosperity are unnatural. When achieved, they are the result of
sustained cooperation among great powers---that is, of an international
order.

DOUBLING DOWN ON DEMOCRACY

[History shows that eras of fluid multipolarity typically end in
disaster,]{.underline} regardless of the bright ideas or advanced
technologies circulating at the time. [The late eighteenth century
witnessed the pinnacle of the Enlightenment]{.underline} in Europe,
before the continent [descended into the hell of the Napoleonic
Wars]{.underline}. At the start of the twentieth century, the world's
sharpest minds predicted an end to great-power conflict as railways,
telegraph cables, and steamships linked countries closer together. The
worst war in history up to that point quickly followed. [The sad and
paradoxical reality is that international orders are vital to avert
chaos]{.underline}, yet they typically emerge only during periods of
great-power rivalry. [Competing with China will be fraught with risk for
the United States and its allies, but it might be the only way to avoid
even greater dangers.]{.underline}

[To build a better future, the United States and its allies will need to
take a more enlightened view of their interests]{.underline} than they
did even during the Cold War. Back then, [their economic interests
dovetailed nicely with their geopolitical interests. Simple
greed,]{.underline} if nothing else, [could compel capitalist states to
band together to protect private property against a communist
onslaught]{.underline}. Now, however, the choice is not so simple,
because standing up to China will entail significant economic costs,
especially in the short term. Those costs might pale in comparison to
the long-term costs of business as usual with Beijing---Chinese
espionage has been estimated to deprive the United States alone of
somewhere between \$200 billion and \$600 billion annually---to say
nothing of the moral quandaries and geopolitical risks of cooperating
with a brutal totalitarian regime with revanchist ambitions. Yet the
ability to make such an enlightened calculation in favor of confronting
China may be beyond the capacities of any nation, especially ones as
polarized as the United States and many of its democratic allies.

#### Tech is intertwined with our society -- coordination and cooperation with core values is key to maintain Western values as well as keep emerging technologies in check

It is fair to say that [our relationship with technology is
complicated]{.underline}. Just look at headline topics like renewable
energy or Artificial Intelligence (AI), or consider pharmaceuticals,
automotive, consumer electronics, social media and biotechnology. On the
topic of any of these technologies, you'll almost certainly hear a
cacophony of voices that range from promising a new era of happiness to
predicting the doom of humanity. How can we make sense of these
confusing perspectives, and [how can we maximise the benefits of
emerging and potentially disruptive technologies]{.underline} while
effectively minimising their risks? How technology evolves As
individuals, we have many different interests in technology. Some are
interested in technology itself, but most are interested in the impact
technology could have. These interests are often competing, and
sometimes downright conflicting. Here is a simplified overview: the
customer is looking for an affordable solution to a given problem,
whereas the designer seeks to improve a given product; the innovator
strives to demonstrate that her idea will work, while the investor is
keen on the return on his investment; the corporate manager is committed
to increasing his company's revenue and market share, whereas the
regulator focuses on questions of safety and environmental impact; the
citizen wants to maximise her freedoms and have her rights protected,
while the politician tries to balance all the aforementioned interests
in devising policies for the benefit of all. This massive entanglement
of interests includes technological ideas, economic and business
interests, societal needs, and political considerations. Most of us,
most of the time, pursue several of those interests in parallel:
certainly as customers and citizens, but also as individuals and members
of communities that affect our thinking and the choices we make. None of
these considerations are predetermined, nor are the resulting choices
and decisions. Therefore, the collective outcome cannot be predicted. We
cannot pre-state the developmental path of any technology. However, it
would be hare-brained to conclude that technology follows a path of its
own or that we have no influence on technology at all. Quite to the
contrary, **[we]{.underline}** **[all influence technology
development]{.underline}**, only, this influence is rarely direct or
immediately visible. The complexity researcher W. Brian Arthur
summarised our multi-faceted relationship with technology as follows:
"**[[Technology]{.mark} areas [co-evolve]{.mark} together [with
society]{.mark} in a process of mutual adaptation]{.underline}**." In
other words, our choices today affect the trajectory of a given
technology's further development. That development will in turn present
new opportunities and challenges that we will respond to, and this
response will influence the further evolution of that technology in an
open-ended process. Take the steam engine for example. This machine
marked the beginning of the Industrial Revolution when it was first
introduced to pump water from coalmines. That successful application
triggered further imagination, as developers and users alike came to
look for other problems a steam engine could solve. Those considerations
led to the mechanisation of agriculture and manufacturing, so that the
steam engine would ultimately replace horse and oxen as humankind's
primary power sources. The story did not end there. Railroads,
factories, work contracts, and labour unions all emerged in response to
that new technology. None of these long-term impacts were foreseeable,
intended, or planned. Rather, they were the result of mutual influencing
of technology and society. The steam engine marked the Industrial
Revolution when it was first introduced to pump water from coalmines. ©
Local Histories The steam engine marked the Industrial Revolution when

The history of the steam engine showcases how technology itself is
neither good nor bad. But it is not neutral either. Technology is what
we make it. Our choices matter. The question is "How can we make
technology what we want it to be?" Shaping technology Any attempt at
shaping the trajectory of a given technology faces a genuine dilemma
between today's knowledge about the future and the available means to
affect or change that future. David Collingridge was the first to frame
the major challenge of policy making on emerging technologies: "When
change is easy, the need for it cannot be foreseen ; when the need for
change is apparent, change has become expensive, difficult and time
consuming." We are literally caught between a rock and a hard place. For
a nascent technology, we cannot know all its future applications, nor
can we anticipate all its future impacts. Still, at this time, we can
exert some control over its development path. In the future, when that
technology is mature, we see its full impact. We can thus define what we
would like to change. Alas, because the technology is already in the
market, broadly distributed and widely used at that time, our means of
control are very limited. We are struggling with a fundamental
characteristic of technology development: the principle uncertainty
inherent to an open-ended process without a knowable end-state. We
cannot know in advance the future target for today's policy
intervention. But what can we actually do? Would it not be a fair choice
to accept the limits of our knowledge, to simply "let things run their
due course"? Think about social media. These services promised
connectivity across the planet, facilitating new forms of meaningful
information-sharing and enabling global communities of unprecedented
scale and scope. Their free-of-charge operation is naturally attractive
to users, but "behind the scenes" they rely on an advertising-backed
business model. For that to work, users should ideally stay connected
24/7 in order to feed the evermore-sophisticated micro-targeting
algorithms. Such addictive behaviour and the increasing manipulation
facilitated by it are not in the users' interest. Nor are echo chambers,
hate speech, and the tampering with democratic elections in the interest
of our societies. While the promise of social media is compelling, we
made two cardinal mistakes. First, we accepted proprietary platforms
operated by business enterprises. Second, we forgot that the purpose of
business is profit, not philanthropy. The case of social media
demonstrates that the users' immediate choices can counteract their
longer-term interests. Furthermore, a market left to its own devices can
spin out of control. Both findings apply in particular to promising
nascent technologies during their emerging early development. These
fledglings still need to find the products they could successfully
deliver and the markets they could serve. And all the various
interest-holders still need to learn how they might be affected by those
technologies. As such as technology evolves, we can be sure that
innovators, investors and users will be the first on the scene, pursuing
their specific interests. Designers and corporate managers will soon
join, once the technology demonstrates its effectiveness and first
product ideas prove viable. Only after the maturing technology's impact
has become tangible, will regulators, citizens, and politicians enter
the discussion. I argue that --in the case of emerging and potentially
disruptive technologies-- these last interventions come too late. Social
media promised connectivity across the planet, facilitating new forms of
meaningful information sharing and enabling global communities of
unprecedented scale and scope. Picture © Coosto What we want technology
to be [Throughout history]{.underline}, **[[we harnessed
tech]{.mark}nology [to gain]{.mark} [or maintain]{.mark} military
[advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without much differentiation, we did
what we could do: whatever was technologically doable appeared the right
thing to do[. [Is]{.mark} [that]{.mark} "can-do" [attitude sufficient
to]{.mark} guide us into [the future]{.mark}]{.underline}? My answer is
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and I will argue [in favour of a
**values-driven approach towards technology for defence and security
purposes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Humanity lost its innocence
Historically, humanity did not have the means to hurt its immediate
existence, neither intentionally nor unintentionally. Early in the 20th
century, we learned about the power of the atom. For the first time, we
created a tool that could potentially destroy our very existence. Once
that genie was out of the bottle, by mid-century, we worked hard to
regain control by weaving nuclear arms control into the nascent
international order. Whether we like it or not: humanity lost the
innocence of ignorance. We have access to potentially destructive means
and we know it. Hence, we can neither deny nor reject the responsibility
we have for our technologies' impact, both intended and unintended.
These technologies are different Today, we face multiple emerging
technologies that promise to disrupt our established ways, including AI,
bio- and quantum technologies. They mature in parallel, at 21st century
speed, in a hyper-connected world. Take one specific area: the
combination of AI, Big Data (as input to AI), and autonomy (as one of
the main applications of AI). This technology area promises to disrupt
the information sphere and "change everything", from maintaining
situational awareness to supporting decision-making, from predictive
maintenance to cyber defence. Yet amidst the euphoria about
opportunities, we must afford a sober reality check and ask ourselves
critical questions on how we want to develop, feed, and use such
systems: would we consider the Chinese Social Credit System as a role
model for collecting data? Should we accept black-box algorithms for
data processing, when they present results, but cannot explain their
plausibility? Should we apply AI in critical decision-making, where we
seek to maintain human oversight? Most of the key technologies operate
in the information domain. Given their superior connectivity and speed,
their development is particularly challenging to follow, let alone
anticipate. Yet, developers focus on civilian applications with global
consumer markets in mind, and the Big Tech companies pushing these
developments have become the most influential non-state actors on the
planet. All of these factors increase the complexity of the problem
space, while at the same time accelerating the speed to technological
evolution. In short: our challenges keep growing, while our response
time shrinks. Take one specific area: the combination of AI, Big Data
(as input to AI), and autonomy (as one of the main applications of AI).
This technology area promises to disrupt the information sphere and
"change everything", from maintaining situational awareness to
supporting decision-making, from predictive maintenance to cyber
defence. © Information Matters The West is not alone Our Western values,
including the rule of law, democracy, individual liberty, and human
rights, provide a solid frame for tackling those challenges. However, we
must recognise that their universality is contested, sometimes subtly,
sometimes overtly. As the political economist Jeffrey Sachs observed,
"Geopolitical power and technological prowess are no longer the
privileged preserve of the North Atlantic." [**[It would be
short-sighted to assume that Western countries could globally enforce
emerging technologies]{.underline}**']{.mark} compliance with Western
values. **[[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}**, differences in values may
well result in divergent technological competences that can, in turn,
affect the global distribution of power. **[[Setting
norms]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[a role for
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**? Emerging and Disruptive Technologies (EDTs)
came into NATO's political focus in 2019, when NATO leaders adopted an
implementation roadmap for seven such technologies. [Regardless of
their]{.underline} tremendous [promise]{.underline}, we [must realise
that these technologies are not yet mature]{.underline}, not yet "fully
out there". Therefore, considerable uncertainty remains to which extent
these fledgling technologies and their foreseeable applications are
appropriately contained within established legal, ethical, and moral
norms. These questions are not limited to military applications, nor do
they stop at national borders: rather, they cut across many government
departments and business sectors, and they affect humanity in its
entirety**[. In this complex, fast moving, high-stake setting, we [must
view technology and values as intertwined]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While
our values should guide our use of technology, we must recognise that
our technology choices will, whether intended or not, reflect the values
we adhere to. As inaction is not an option, **[[we must take active
measures to establish norms]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the future use of
[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}**; norms that are deeply rooted in
our values; technologies that are currently emerging and have recognised
disruption potential (**[[such as AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, and quantum technology). [How
could we realistically master this novel challenge]{.underline}? **[The
following three proposals could pave the way]{.underline}**. **[[We
must]{.mark} effectively [cope with the uncertainties of technology
evolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Hence, **[I [suggest evolutionary
policy-making]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[building on current
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [but]{.underline} **[[flexible enough
so that today's decisions can be adjusted or corrected in the
future]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[W]{.mark}e must strive to limit
potential harm without unduly constraining the benefits a technology can
bring]{.underline}**. **[Therefore, [our policies should set limits for
the application of technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}** (such as
genetically optimised super-soldiers) **[rather than banning entire
technology areas]{.underline}** ([in this case]{.underline},
[biotech]{.underline}nology). We need to understand when policy changes
are necessary and what those changes should be. **[Reflecting the
diversity of interests, [we need to institutionalise a broad stakeholder
engagement that reaches out to all parties affected by a technology and
influencing its evolution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Within this broadly
applicable framing, [NATO's role is specific]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As
the international organisation committed to defence and security in the
North Atlantic area, it convenes considerable political, military,
economic, and technological **[power. [Building]{.mark} in particular
[on its political and intellectual capital]{.mark}, [the Alliance can
credibly spearhead norm setting for tech]{.mark}nology [applications in
defence to comply with Western values]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With its
recently published AI Strategy, NATO fulfils its traditional role in an
innovative way. [This Strategy embraces principles of responsible use,
which express the value-driven norms that NATO and its member nations
will adhere to in the application of AI]{.underline}. **[[By making
these principles public, they set an example for other nations to
consider and]{.mark} potentially [adopt NATO's
principles]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This is an effective approach
towards proposing and gradually implementing an international
norm]{.underline}, not unlike the European Union's General Data
Protection Regulation. At the same, [[NATO responds to the globally
distributed innovation landscape]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[The NATO2030
initiative highlights the need to forge new
coalitions]{.underline}]{.mark}** with likeminded partners beyond the
North-Atlantic region. This broad outreach should not only extend to
governmental organisations, it should in general expand the types of
partners to collaborate with (even **[[within Allied
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}**), to include non-governmental
organisations, the private sector, academia, and civil society.
[[Establishing norms]{.mark} [to frame]{.mark} technology
[development]{.mark}]{.underline} within the limits of our established
value system is a defining challenge of the 21st century. Our values
alone should be the driving force for the policies we devise and the
capabilities we field. **[As [technologies keep emerging, so should our
policies for setting appropriate]{.mark} norms]{.underline}** bounded by
the values we hold dear.

### Democracy impacts

#### Democracies must maintain a tech edge to prevent power wars

**Kroenig**, Mathew, Professor in the department of government at
Georgetown, **Winter 2021** ("Will Emerging Technology Cause Nuclear
War?: Bringing Geopolitics Back In", Air University, Winter, 2021,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-4/D-Kroenig.pdf>,
accessed 6/27/22, ,FLC)

This understanding of this issue leads to different policy
prescriptions[. If the tech]{.underline}nology [itself is the
problem]{.underline}, [then it must be controlled and should not be
allowed to spread to any states]{.underline}. In contrast[, the
framework outlined here suggests a different recommendation: preserve
the prevailing balance of power in Europe and Asia. Technological change
that, on balance, reinforces the prevailing international system should
strengthen stability.]{.underline}

[Leading democracies, therefore, should increase investments in emerging
technology to maintain a technological edge over their adversaries.
Export control and nonproliferation measures should be designed to deny
emerging military technology to Russia and China.]{.underline} Arms
control should be negotiated with the primary objective of sustaining
the current international distribution of power. Making progress in
these areas will be difficult. But the consequences of failure could be
shifts in the international balance of power, conflict among great
powers, and an increased risk of nuclear war.

#### Democratic backsliding spills over, risking nuclear war

Dr. Larry **Diamond '19**, Professor of Political Science and Sociology
at Stanford University, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Senior
Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, PhD in
Sociology from Stanford University, Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from
Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency, p. 199-202

[This is truer now than ever]{.underline}, for several reasons. [We live
in a globalized world, one in which **[models]{.mark}**, trends, and
ideas]{.underline} [**[cascade across borders]{.mark}**. Any wind of
[change may gather **quickly**]{.mark} and []{.mark}blow with **gale
force**. [People]{.mark} everywhere [form ideas]{.mark} about how to
govern]{.underline}---or simply about which forms of government and
sources of power may be irresistible---[[based on what they **see
happening elsewhere**. We are]{.mark} now immersed [in a]{.mark} fierce
**[global contest of ideas]{.mark}**, information, and
norms]{.underline}. In the digital age, that contest is moving at
lightning speed, shaping how people think about their political systems
and the way the world runs. [As doubts about and threats to democracy
are mounting in the West, this is not a contest that the democracies can
afford to lose.]{.underline}

Globalization, with its flows of trade and information, raises the
stakes for us in another way. Authoritarian and badly governed regimes
increasingly pose a direct threat to popular sovereignty and the rule of
law in our own democracies. Covert flows of money and influence are
subverting and corrupting our democratic processes and institutions.
They will not stop just because Americans and others pretend that we
have no stake in the future of freedom in the world. If we want to
defend the core principles of self-government, transparency, and
accountability in our own democracies, we have no choice but to promote
them globally.

It is not enough to say that dictatorship is bad and that democracy,
however flawed, is still better. Popular enthusiasm for a lesser evil
cannot be sustained indefinitely. People need the inspiration of a
positive vision. Democracy must demonstrate that it is a just and fair
political system that advances humane values and the common good.

To make our republics more perfect, established democracies must not
only adopt reforms to more fully include and empower their own citizens.
They must also support people, groups, and institutions struggling to
achieve democratic values elsewhere. The best way to counter Russian
rage and Chinese ambition is to show that Moscow and Beijing are on the
wrong side of history; that people everywhere yearn to be free; and that
they can make freedom work to achieve a more just, sustainable, and
prosperous society.

In our networked age, both idealism and [the harder imperatives of
**global**]{.underline} power and [**security** argue for more
democracy, not less]{.underline}. For one thing, [if we do not worry
about]{.underline} the [quality of governance]{.underline} in
lower-income countries, [[we will face]{.mark} more and more **troubled
and [failing states]{.mark}**[. **Famine** and **genocide**]{.mark} are
the curse of authoritarian states, not democratic ones. Outright
**[state collapse]{.mark}** is the ultimate, bitter fruit of tyranny.
When countries like [**Syria**, **Libya**, and **Afghanistan**]{.mark}
descend [into **civil war**]{.mark}; when poor states in Africa cannot
generate jobs and improve their citizens' lives due to rule by corrupt
and callous strongmen; when Central American societies are held hostage
by brutal gangs and kleptocratic rulers, people flee---and wash up on
the shores of the democracies]{.underline}. Europe and the United States
cannot withstand the rising pressures of immigration unless they work to
support better, more stable and accountable government in troubled
countries. [The world has]{.underline} simply [grown too
small]{.underline}, too flat, and too fast [to **wall off**]{.underline}
rotten [states]{.underline} and pretend they are on some other planet.

[**Hard security interests** are at stake]{.underline}. As even the
Trump administration's 2017 National Security Strategy makes clear, [the
**[main threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} to U.S. national security [all
[stem from **authoritarianism**]{.mark}, whether in the form of
tyrannies [from **Russia**]{.mark} and **[China]{.mark}** to [**Iran**
and **North Korea** or]{.mark} in the guise of antidemocratic terrorist
movements such as **[ISIS]{.mark}**]{.underline}.1 [[By
supporting]{.mark} the development of [democracy]{.mark} around the
world, [we can deny these]{.mark} authoritarian adversaries the
**[geopolitical running room]{.mark}** they seek]{.underline}. Just as
Russia, China, and Iran are trying to undermine democracies to bend
other countries to their will, so too can [we **contain**]{.underline}
these [autocrats' ambitions by helping]{.underline} other countries
[build effective]{.underline}, resilient [democracies]{.underline} that
can withstand the dictators' malevolence.

Of course, democratically elected governments with open societies will
not support the American line on every issue. But no free society wants
to mortgage its future to another country. The American national
interest would best be secured by a pluralistic world of free
countries---one in which autocrats can no longer use corruption and
coercion to gobble up resources, alliances, and territory.

If you look back over our history to see who has posed a threat to the
United States and our allies, it has always been authoritarian regimes
and empires. As political scientists have long noted, [[**no two
democracies** have **ever gone to war**]{.mark} with each
other---[**ever**. It is not]{.mark} the [democracies]{.mark} of the
world that are [supporting]{.mark} international [**terrorism**,
proliferating **w**]{.mark}]{.underline}eapons of
**[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**estruction,
[or threatening the territory of their neighbors]{.underline}.

#### Influence with Europe is key to overall U.S. hegemony

Stephen **Walt '22**, "America's Foreign Policy Elite and the Decline of
U.S. Primacy with Stephen Walt," HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL,
https://www.hks.harvard.edu/wiener-conference-calls/stephen-walt

It begins by recognizing we are still extremely secure here in the
western hemisphere. That the main threat to the United States over the
long haul would be a peer competitor. A rival country that dominated its
own region, the same way the United States is the dominant power in the
western hemisphere. A country that did that would be then free to
project power around the world the same way the United States now does,
including into the western hemisphere. Our main goal should be to
prevent any state from dominating Europe, dominating Asia, dominating
the Persian Gulf. Those are the key centers of power in the world.

Summary. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[has]{.mark} [a renewed focus]{.mark} on
defense and deterrence in Europe]{.underline}. In the past, NATO relied
at least in part on its military technological superiority over
potential adversaries for defense and deterrence in Europe, but some
**[[policymakers are increasingly concerned that NATO's technological
superiority is eroding]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Russia]{.mark},
[China]{.mark}, [and others]{.mark} [are modernizing their
militaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [investing in new and emerging
technologies]{.underline}, [and exploring their applications for
defense]{.underline}. In addition, **[[NATO faces rising]{.mark}
operating [costs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} both
**[[conventional and hybrid challenges]{.mark} in operating domains that
have expanded to include cyberspace]{.underline}** as well as land, sea,
and air. [[NATO]{.mark} [must]{.mark} also [contend with a growing group
of nonstate challengers]{.mark}]{.underline} em[powered by the pace of
technological change and the global diffusion of
technology]{.underline}. Increasingly dependent on ubiquitous
technology, NATO is adapting to a world in which commercial investments
in research and development (R&D) outpace those of governments,
innovation cycles are shortening, and there is more international
competition for technology and innovation. Since 2014, the United States
has promoted defense innovation as a strategy to integrate new
technologies into military capabilities and strengthen U.S.
technological superiority over its potential adversaries. Today, [many
[European allies acknowledge]{.mark} the importance of
[technology]{.mark} and innovation in defense]{.underline}, and [they
are beginning to respond to the changing environment]{.underline} by
committing more resources to defense, and a [[few have national defense
innovation strategies of their own]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[The
U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom,
**[France]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
**[Germany]{.underline}**---[NATO's largest European defense
spenders]{.underline}---[are investing more in R&D and reforming their
defense ministries to take more risk]{.underline}, procure technology
faster, develop innovative concepts, and strengthen their links with
commercial industry. Generally speaking, however, [[European governments
are still in the early stages of developing what are predominantly
national strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[[NATO seeks to harmonize
the allies' national strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and defense
investments, **[[promote collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and
build a shared vision for the future]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Its member
states have sophisticated militaries, institutional frameworks for
collaboration, and dynamic economies that attract talent, and support
innovation. **[Innovation challenges persist]{.underline}**, however,
such as those related to NATO's limited budgets and its bureaucratic
processes, which make it difficult for NATO to attract the attention of
commercial industry and global technology companies. NATO is also
working to balance its member states' concerns over national sovereignty
with the need for more multinational cooperation, both from a cost and
from an interoperability point of view. NATO also seeks to enhance
interoperability among allied militaries and balance short-term
priorities with preparations for future warfare. In the future, NATO
might have to rely as much on its agility and on its capacity for
innovation as it has relied on its military technological advantage in
the past. [[Congress may consider what role the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [can play to support NATO's
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[and what channels [Congress could
pursue to exert influence over NATO's direction]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[There are]{.mark}]{.underline} both risks and [**[opportunities
associated with sharing technology]{.underline}** **[or]{.underline}**
**[developing it jointly with NATO allies]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and
there are questions about what the United States and its allies expect
from one another in terms of technology and innovation. **[[Technology
has the potential to enhance NATO's
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but it also has the potential to
undermine interoperability or political cohesion if the United States
develops a technology-driven strategy and its NATO allies either do not
keep pace, or do not adapt to strategic, political, and technological
change.

allow us to better harness civilian innovation for our security and
facilitate trans-Atlantic cooperation and exchanges on critical
technologies. Finally, we are addressing the impact of climate change on
our security. It is a threat and a crisis multiplier, and we have to
adapt our awareness and readiness accordingly. Allies are also investing
in sustainable solutions, including biofuels for jet aircraft and solar
panels to power equipment. In addition, and for the first time ever,
NATO is developing a methodology across the alliance to map military
emissions so we can cut them. [In all these areas, NATO will engage even
more closely with partners that share our values and interests,
including countries, organizations, private companies and academic
institutions. Preserving peace, the global rules and our democratic way
of life is a collective effort]{.underline}. In June 2022, NATO leaders
will meet again, this time in Madrid, Spain. They will endorse NATO's
next Strategic Concept --- a key document that will chart the way ahead
for the alliance. The last Strategic Concept, which dates back to 2010,
refers to Russia as a strategic partner; it does not mention China, and
only briefly alludes to technology and climate. The new document will
reflect our changed security environment and restate our fundamental
values while reaffirming the centrality of the trans-Atlantic bond to
our security and defense. As we look to the year ahead, we must continue
to deliver on our commitment to trans-Atlantic unity and turn our NATO
2030 decisions into action. This way, we will continue to ensure
security and freedom of all our people in a more uncertain world. Jens
Stoltenberg is the secretary general of NATO.

#### Growing interest in tech cooperation between U.S. and her allies

[The [growing interest in]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology [cooperation among
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and its allies
stems from]{.mark} both [the nature of]{.mark} emerging
[tech]{.mark}nologies [and]{.mark} shifts in the relative capabilities
of key [global players]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Technologies such
a]{.underline}s artificial intelligence (AI) and [[biotech]{.mark}nology
[are dual use]{.mark}, meaning in the broadest sense that they have the
capability to do good and to do harm]{.underline}. For example, [new
genomic coding techniques were instrumental in developing a Covid-19
vaccine; however, the same technology can be used to develop another
dangerous disease]{.underline}. In an [international policy context,
these and other emerging technologies are considered dual use in that
they have both commercial and military applications]{.underline}. [The
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [and]{.mark} its [allies have a
shared interest in ensuring that the benefits of dual-use technologies
are maximized and the risks mitigated or managed]{.mark}.]{.underline}
More generally, allies have an interest in minimizing threats to an open
internet and digital connectivity, such as intellectual property theft
or cyberattacks.

[The other driver of increased interest in allied technology cooperation
is the fact that the United States no longer holds an unrivaled lead in
the development and deployment of critical technologies]{.underline}.
This is partly the result of underinvestment in the traditional
foundations of U.S. innovation---such as infrastructure, federal
research and development (R&D), relevant education and skills---and
partly due to rising capabilities in other countries. In 2020, the
United States ranked ninth behind European and Asian competitors in
Bloomberg's global innovation index. Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and the
Netherlands have joined the United States as critical players in
semiconductor manufacturing. China, Europe, Canada, and Israel all have
formidable capabilities in AI and biotech. And the global
telecommunications equipment market is dominated by two Chinese and two
European suppliers; the United States has no integrated-hardware
suppliers in a sector that forms the backbone of today's digital
economy.

### NATO solves -- COVID proves

**NATO Solves Biotech threats, past empirics proves**

22-6-15)-JLI

With the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, for the first time in its
history NATO had to face an attack against each of its member states at
once. Given the backdrop of political tensions within the alliance in
the past few years, there were not many reasons to be optimistic about
NATO's response, especially at a moment when trans-Atlantic allies were
failing to coordinate on travel restrictions and competing over supplies
of medical equipment. In spite of this, [NATO]{.underline} was [able to
leverage its experience in crisis management and disaster
relief]{.underline} to provide two kinds of responses.

First, [NATO focused on ensuring the continuity of its operations while
protecting its personnel, to prevent the health crisis from impacting
readiness.]{.underline} Most NATO missions were preserved, but some
encountered temporary suspensions. Military drillings were redesigned,
including the U.S.-led NATO exercise DEFENDER-Europe 20, to prevent
further spread of the virus through movement of ground troops. In
addition, [NATO's public diplomacy branch multiplied efforts to counter
disinformation from China and Russia]{.underline}.

Second, [amidst a low point for international cooperation, NATO set up a
COVID-19 Task Force aimed at coordinating the delivery of medical aid
across and beyond the territory of the alliance.]{.underline} Such
actions, although performed through the means of NATO member states and
relatively limited in scope, were an [important testimony of the
reactive capability of the alliance and of solidarity between member
states. Yet, it is reasonable to imagine that more could have been done
if the organization did not have to overcome political tensions across
the Atlantic]{.underline}, and member states had cooperated from the
beginning under the leadership of NATO's strongest member.

[From this experience NATO could draw important lessons, from improving
resilience to external threats to investing in readiness for
catastrophic scenarios like a global pandemic.]{.underline} The fact
that COVID-19 will continue disrupting the global economy and supply
chains will have a negative impact on countries' defense spending and
defense industries. [However, given the resilience the alliance has
shown so far, COVID-19 will not be the determining factor for the future
of NATO. Instead, the chances for NATO to operate efficiently vis-à-vis
growing global challenges will ultimately depend on a relaunch of trans-
Atlantic relations.]{.underline}

A WORLD OF BIOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES

[[Mutual self-interest provides a strong basis for **transatlantic
cooperation in biotechnology**]{.mark} [based on]{.mark} shared
recognition of its vast [potential to provide solutions to]{.mark} some
of [civilization's most pressing problems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thanks
to explosive advances in our understanding of the many ways in which
promiscuous nature has been manipulating DNA and RNA for the past
billion years, it is widely anticipated that the 21st century will
belong to biology.1 We are now at the point where our ability to
innovate is constrained less by technical capability than by the limits
of our imaginations. [Multiple [laboratories and companies on both sides
of the Atlantic]{.mark} (and throughout the world) [are pursuing
promising applications]{.mark}]{.underline}, and experience confirms
progress would be accelerated by cooperative approaches. But there are
some considerable challenges, especially in agricultural and industrial
contexts.

[The most important rate-limiting factor in our ability to harness
biological innovations to the challenges of feeding the world,
sustaining human and environmental health, and addressing climate
change, is the burden imposed by ill-considered
regulations]{.underline}. Unless this bottleneck can be unblocked, the
enormous potential for transatlantic scientific cooperation will not
yield the necessary fruits.

DIVERGENT REGULATORY PATHS: PRECAUTION VS. OPENNESS TO INNOVATION

[[Existing policies]{.mark}, legislation, and regulations [do little or
nothing to advance]{.mark} human or environmental
[safety]{.mark}.]{.underline}2 Born out of understandable caution at the
dawn of recombinant DNA technologies, today their most obvious impact is
to obstruct and discourage research, development, and deployment of
innovative solutions to various challenges.3 This is so despite an
abundant record of production and consumption of new biotech products
with enviable records of improved safety, superior sustainability, and
widespread beneficial economic impacts.4 The benefits are so substantial
that a pattern has emerged of farmers breaking the law to acquire and
plant improved seeds in countries where governments have lagged in
allowing access.5

It is one thing to implement policies and regulations ostensibly
designed to ensure safety; it is quite another to ignore vast data and
decades of experience around the world to maintain obsolete policies and
regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability, but only
impede our ability to use the most innovative, precise, and safest tools
to address our gravest challenges.6

In terms of regulatory policy and openness to biological innovations,
the width of the Atlantic might be measured better in light years than
miles or kilometers. As imperfect as regulations for the products of
biotechnology are in North America, they are simply indefensible in
Europe.7

[The United States decided in 1986, after years of study and
consultation, that no new laws were required to ensure the safety of
crops and foods improved through biotechnology.]{.underline} This was
based on the finding that they present no novel hazards, and foreseeable
risks of their development and use fall into categories with which
humans have considerable experience from millennia of conventional plant
and animal breeding.8 The United States therefore decided to regulate
these novel products under existing authorities administered by the
Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and
Environmental Protection Agency.9 While implementation of this policy,
the "Coordinated Framework," has been far from perfect, it has been
sufficiently predictable and science-based to enable an explosion of
innovation, new product development, and commercial activity.
Consequently, the United States has led the world to the present day
wherein crops improved through biotechnology are now the global standard
for quality seeds, delivering improved yields, safety, sustainability,
and economic productivity around the world, with the lion's share of
benefits accruing on behalf of small farmers in developing countries.10
Europe took a different approach.

[It is one thing to implement policies and regulations ostensibly
designed to ensure safety; it is quite another to ignore vast data and
decades of experience around the world to maintain obsolete policies and
regulations that add nothing to safety or sustainability.]{.underline}

[The European Union decided to regulate seeds improved through
biotechnology]{.underline} as a novel class governed under new
regulations specifically focused on an arbitrary category known as
"GMOs" (for "genetically modified organisms"). The conceit was that
because they represented gene combinations produced by mechanisms
supposedly "not found in nature" (but actually ubiquitous) they must
present novel hazards, even though none has ever been identified. These
putatively novel hazards, despite the lack of any concrete
manifestations, allegedly required dedicated, specific, "precautionary"
regulations. The resulting regulatory regime proved so burdensome it led
to the general collapse of agricultural biotechnology in Europe, which
had played a leading role in its discovery and invention. Permissions
for field trials proved almost impossible to obtain, products could not
be developed and brought to market, academic labs abandoned the field,
and the industry relocated most of its assets and activities to the
Americas. [And Europe became the world's largest importer of commodity
foods improved through biotechnology, only recently surpassed by
China.]{.underline}

OPPORTUNITY FOR TRANSATLANTIC COOPERATION

[Many scientists in [the EU]{.mark} (and around the world) knew from the
beginning that this [was the wrong approach, yet the EU pushed its model
internationally, with aggressive diplomacy, leading to emulation by many
countries in the developing world, with]{.mark} equally **[unhappy
results]{.mark}** to those seen in Europe]{.underline}.11 But a growing
number of scientists, policymakers, and even "green" NGOs that had
originally opposed GMOs, now recognize the counterproductive results of
this approach and are working to avoid repeating the same mistakes with
gene editing. This shines a spotlight on the most important and
potentially fruitful opportunity for transatlantic cooperation in
biotechnology: the revival of science-based regulatory regimes in which
the degree of regulatory oversight is proportional to the hazards
involved, and regulation that enables, rather than discourages the safe
development of innovative products. A return to and reaffirmation of
these first principles would provide fertile ground for cooperation and
coordination globally. Regulatory reform (everywhere, not just in the EU
and its emulators, though the need is greatest there) provides fertile
ground for transatlantic cooperation and coordination. We have robust
models of proven approaches.12 Without such cooperation, other progress
in developing and deploying innovative solutions through biotechnology
will be impeded or foregone.

As to national security risks, just as with other risks, novelty
attributable to biotechnology is elusive. [One can do very nasty things
with conventional bioweapons,]{.underline} and they are easily magnified
with recombinant DNA techniques. At the same time, defensive capacities
are also buttressed by biotechnology, as demonstrated by the rapid
development of mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. There has been some
good work done in this area, but this topic is worth exploring at
greater depth. The OECD has a track record of thoughtful analyses with
such topics. One possibility would be to build on that foundation by
establishing a joint OECD/NATO working group to serve as a forum.

What Should Be Done? Three core tasks have traditionally defined NATO's
activities: collective defense, collective security, and crisis
management**[. [NATO should add]{.mark} a fourth: [collective resilience
through innovation]{.mark}. [The aim of the new core task would be to
prioritize NATO's capacity to innovate and learn,]{.mark} and in so
doing, bind states more tightly together as an alliance. [This task
would aim to expand and strengthen existing NATO efforts]{.mark} like
the NATO 2030 Initiative to ensure innovation remains a key part of the
alliance, not just until 2030, but until 2100. What's more, [it offers
specific paths to realize the commitments NATO members made]{.mark} in
the 2021 Brussels Summit Communique to strengthen NATO [as an organizing
framework]{.mark}, [enhance resilience]{.mark}, [foster technological
cooperation]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} strengthen NATO [capacity
building]{.mark}. The starting point for innovation is expanding
research and development collaboration]{.underline}**. NATO recently
started a Defense Innovation Fund and a Defense Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA). The forty-seven test centers and nine
accelerators under DIANA need to be integrated as a permanent feature of
the alliance as a whole, which means codifying how the accelerator sets
priorities, how research results are disseminated, and how research
findings support other NATO activities. **[[NATO should also go beyond
the accelerator to encourage and enable the creation of more bilateral
and multilateral research agreements and general memorandums of
understanding on research cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But that's
just the start. How militaries use technology is often more important
than the technology itself. France and Germany's use of tanks during
World War Two is a good illustration. Although France and Germany
developed tanks with similar capabilities, they used them in different
ways, to very different effects. French tanks were mostly an augment to
infantry forces, while Germany built its entire blitzkrieg strategy
around tanks, linking them together with new radio and other
communications technologies. New NATO centres of excellence focused on
various disruptive technologies can help with this by better educating
NATO members about these technologies and supporting doctrine
development, interoperability, and testing and validating concepts. NATO
should launch a "War Game 2030 Initiative" to identify, experiment with,
and evaluate new concepts for employing technologies and considering the
ways adversaries might employ them. NATO could hold alliance-wide
competitions to assess different answers to common defense questions
such as: what combination of unmanned and manned systems are most
effective in amphibious assault missions? Winners would earn points of
military pride for their country and contribute to the alliance in ways
beyond simple defense spending metrics. In addition, NATO should explore
new ways to conduct war games, especially through the use of synthetic
environments. NATO might partner with non-traditional stakeholders like
video game designers and eSports leagues to draw on their experience in
making realistic, dynamic war gaming environments. **[[NATO has]{.mark}
thirty members. That's [a lot of opportunities for coop]{.mark}eration.
In fact, there are 435 possibilities for bilateral cooperation, with
possibilities including everything from Albanian ties with Belgium to
joint United Kingdom and American cooperation. NATO should establish a
NATO diplomatic corps to help identify opportunities for interstate
collaboration and support collective NATO diplomatic goals. NATO
diplomats could be stationed at each NATO member state, critical
non-NATO partners and rivals, and international organizations like the
European Union. NATO diplomats could also help advance common NATO
positions around emerging international treaty issues like the Treaty
for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons and calls to ban autonomous
weapons. This would differ from existing defense attaches and
inter-state diplomacy in that NATO diplomats would represent collective
NATO interests, not just national interests. The North Atlantic Council
and the NATO Military Committee require consensus between member
states]{.underline}**. Innovation can be tough when thirty member
nations need to agree to it. And even tougher if more nations join. To
that end, NATO should establish a fast-track option to allow the North
Atlantic Council and the Military Committee to make decisions based on
strong majorities (e.g., 60 percent or 75 percent agreement) in specific
circumstances. For example, NATO might agree to deploy assets in a
conflict on a consensus but allow certain details to be agreed upon by a
majority. Of course, states who own those assets may be required to sign
off on any decision or receive greater voting weight, which would give
greater influence on the details of employment. This would streamline
and improve NATO decision-making so that NATO decisions are not always
the lowest common denominator. Likewise, a majority decision-making
mechanism would also allow greater opportunity to sanction member
nations for not upholding the common democratic values of the alliance.
The NATO diplomatic corps and updated NATO military committee would also
serve a defensive role in insulating the alliance from adversary
information attacks. Mis-, dis-, and malinformation complexify alliance
decision-making, as they may strengthen voices opposed to NATO decisions
or voices opposed to NATO as an institution. That can be a major
challenge, given that the North Atlantic Council requires decisions to
be made by consensus. If one member opposes the decision, the whole
process is stymied or at least delayed. The NATO diplomatic corps could
help counter those effects by representing common NATO interests to
member states. That could include advocacy for common NATO positions,
supporting greater burden-sharing efforts, and finding and encouraging
new ways to tie NATO members together. Likewise, a non-consensus NATO
Military Committee would not require all alliance members to agree. If
one NATO member, due to a combination of information attacks and other
reasons, opposes a decision, the alliance can still make decisions. The
alliance could be further strengthened through innovative approaches to
thinking about shared infrastructure and resources. NATO members have
common dependencies on logistics routes, energy infrastructure,
communication systems, and supply chains for components used in common
defense systems. There are undoubtedly many more. NATO could draw upon
functions-based approaches pioneered in member states, such as the
National Critical Functions (NCF) framework in the United States or the
Swedish Critical Societal Functions. Such approaches could reveal
alliance-wide or multinational infrastructure dependencies---and
therefore vulnerabilities---that could be targeted by cyber or physical
attacks in the event of major conflict. These activities and the lessons
that come out of them need to be baked into the alliance in the long
term. That is where education comes in. NATO could create a new NATO War
College, providing post-graduate training to NATO officials on the cusp
of senior service. The War College would train the future of NATO's
leadership with a unique focus on multinational military operations,
diplomacy, and business-oriented education on discovering and leveraging
competitive advantages. The War College would fill a gap between the
NATO school and the NATO college by providing longer, in-depth
educational programs. A brick-and-mortar NATO War College would also
help bind the alliance together. The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
afforded NATO officers the opportunity to work closely together and get
to know one another as people. While the withdrawal from Iraq and
Afghanistan were correct policy decisions, the loss of those
opportunities comes with a cost. Future disagreements and even crises
between NATO members are inevitable---just see the disagreements between
Italy and Turkey over Libya. Common educational experiences can help
build the trust and mutual understanding needed to diffuse disagreements
without escalation. Working with another NATO officer is much easier
when one has broken bread, clanked foamy glasses of beer, and traded
embarrassing stories. **[Altogether, these developments aim to
strengthen NATO's ability to fight while also binding NATO members more
closely together. Moreover, they would create new opportunities for NATO
members to contribute. A NATO member might be hesitant to increase
defense spending but willing to support NATO diplomatic and research
activities]{.underline}**. Winning NATO-wide war games or research
competitions should also be an important point of national and alliance
pride. The value of a transformative military concept cannot easily be
measured in dollars or euros, but it would create tremendous value for
the alliance's military forces. NATO's Future Global security is
undergoing drastic changes, from the rise of China to the opening of the
Arctic and the growing importance of cyberspace, outer space, and
artificial intelligence. Some thinkers ponder whether the globe is
experiencing a revolution in military affairs. In some ways, the changes
today are not new---they are reflections of trends built over the last
decades, if not centuries. After all, just over a hundred years ago, the
Ottoman empire was still dominant, air power was just emerging, and
cyberspace and space warfare wasn't even a glimmer. But that's the
point. **[[NATO must be ready for whatever changes
emerge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Some projected trends may manifest;
others may not. **[Others may manifest in different ways than expected,
and other trends that were never expected may manifest. [Adopting
collective resilience through innovation as a core task would allow NATO
to maintain and encourage the technological, conceptual, doctrinal,
strategic, and policy flexibility needed]{.mark} to stay strong and
endure whatever future may emerge.]{.underline}** Note: The author is

"[[Any way the virus could potentially escape, there are]{.mark} at
least two [ways to prevent that]{.mark} from happening]{.underline},"
Damon told BuzzFeed. ["The [samples are]{.mark} kept in biosafety
cabinets, there's negative pressure in the room, doors are
**[airtight]{.mark}** and gasketed. There are multiple ways that, when
air is coming out of the lab, it's then purified and cleaned. And any
waste products generated in the lab are autoclaved]{.underline} \[i.e.,
placed into a pressure chamber to sterilize medical waste\] [and
incinerated]{.underline}." Upon leaving the lab, [workers step into a
decontamination chamber]{.underline}, which showers a mix of chemicals
over their suits to decontaminate anything that may be on the surface.
From the chemical shower, they go through an inner changing room, where
they take off the suit and everything worn beneath it. The clothing worn
in the lab under the spacesuit is treated as a potentially contaminated
material, and thoroughly decontaminated before being laundered. Next,
lab workers must take a personal shower before entering an outer
changing area, where they can then dress into street clothes.

### Biotech not key to weapons

#### Biotech won't be used for weapons or terrorism

Accessed 6/25/22, TR)

[[The **threat** of terrorists using biological agents exists but is
**very limited**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The fear of nonstate actors using
biological agents rose with Aum Shinrikyo's 1995 failed efforts to
spread botulinum and anthrax in Japan[. [Fears]{.mark} of bioterror
[reached]{.mark} its most recent [crescendo with]{.mark} the 2001
[anthrax]{.mark} letter mailings, coming as they did within weeks after
the 9/11 attacks. [The threat of]{.mark} further [bioterror attacks,
however, **never materialized**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Despite the fact that terrorist biological weapons attacks have not
materialized since the Amerithrax scare, [[some]{.mark} continue to
[argue that the supposed ease and lower cost]{.mark} of biological
weapons development, production, and use along with the societal
disruption of COVID-19 has [incentivized bad actors]{.mark} to adopt
biological weapons]{.underline}. These concerns have been echoed by
others who assume that misuse is inevitable and following the COVID-19
example will result in mass casualties and crippling political,
societal, and economic repercussions.

[[However, the]{.mark} bioterror threat [seems to have
**diminished**]{.mark} --- not grown --- since the 2001 Amerithrax
letter mailings]{.underline}. The core al-Qaeda biological weapons
efforts were first envisioned in the late 1990s and began in earnest
shortly afterward. [Yet the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and the fall of
the Taliban in late 2001 effectively disrupted al-Qaeda's biological
weapons work which largely centered on anthrax.]{.underline} Left
without a suitable safe haven, [al-Qaeda was never able to reconstitute
its biological weapons efforts.]{.underline} The Taliban's return to
power in Afghanistan, however, may result in a reemergence of al-Qaeda
and its biological weapons ambitions. Time will tell whether the Taliban
now will grant safe haven to al-Qaeda that could be used for biological
weapons work. What is undoubted is that the Taliban and al-Qaeda have a
shared history and have continued to work closely together. Without a
presence in Afghanistan, U.S. intelligence will have a more difficult
time detecting any resurgent al-Qaeda biological weapons efforts.

[The threat of a biological weapons effort by the Islamic State in Iraq
**never materialized**]{.underline}, although the group did manage to
produce and use chemical weapons agents until that program was
effectively disrupted. Other terrorist groups' interest in biological
weapons has been rudimentary with a focus predominately on toxins such
as ricin and botulinum. U.S. domestic extremists, self-radicalized
individuals, and lone actors also have gravitated toward ricin, but no
known casualties have resulted from the decades-long interest in ricin.

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} analysts, however[, [argue that]{.mark} the
[life science]{.mark} revolution and global proliferation of related
scientific and technical capabilities has [opened a Pandora's Box of
biothreats]{.mark}]{.underline}. The argument goes that the rapid
revolution in genetic engineering --- including synthetic biology ---
the DIY bio movement, and the advent of technologies like CRISPR
(acronym for "clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic
repeats") makes their misuse likely. However, as noted in the 2018
National Academies of Science report, Biodefense in the Age of Synthetic
Biology[, the large-scale [production and delivery]{.mark} of biological
weapons agents [is **inherently difficult**]{.mark}, with biological
weapons use favoring small-scale, highly targeted attacks.]{.underline}

(Accessed 6-27-22)-AO

In relation to existing top-down governance measures for biosecurity,
synthetic biology represents a promising yet potentially destabilizing
advancement in the life sciences, one that could introduce new risks and
regulatory challenges. In particular, a number of high-profle synthetic
biology experiments, ranging from the de novo synthesis of poliovirus
(Cello et al. 2002) to the recent synthesis of horsepox virus (Noyce
et al. 2018), have raised concerns that the same techniques could be
exploited to bypass regulatory controls (e.g. the United States, US,
Select Agent Regulations) on lists of high-risk pathogens. Moreover, the
possibility of synthesizing novel 'taxonomically unclassifed' pathogens
(NSABB 2006; Garfnkel et al. 2007) has led some to question the logic
and utility of current 'list-based' approaches to regulation. Looking to
the future, if synthetic biology does, in fact, 'deskill' the 'art' of
biological engineering, new regulatory approaches could very well be
essential because [the tools of [modern biology will be]{.mark} widely
[accessible to]{.mark} both responsible and [malicious actors.
Claims]{.mark} about synthetic biology's potential, like other emerging
technologies, [nonetheless]{.mark} tend to **[overstate its 'enabling'
capacity]{.mark}**. Likewise, **[the ease of producing biological
weapons tends to be overstated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a number of
commentators note, biology is not yet easy to engineer (Jefferson et al.
2014) and, for the foreseeable future, [[the skills necessary]{.mark} to
produce biological weapons [are likely to remain only within the grasp
of states]{.mark}]{.underline} (Piers Millet in Regalado 2016). However,
the feld's emphasis on eliminating technical barriers and reducing the
importance of tacit knowledge (Oye 2012) represents a powerful source of
expectation for advocates and critics alike. For advocates, it
represents the possible realization of modern biology's full potential,
one that could yield revolutionary advances in health, medicine, and
industry in the twenty-frst century. [[For critics, it represents a
seemingly openended risk that requires **exceptional
precaution**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For national governments, and
international conventions responsible for establishing global
biosecurity norms and obligations that are operationalized at the
national level  through legislation and other regulatory tools (McLeish
and Nightingale 2007), a central question is how (if at all)
does top-down biosecurity governance need to change in response to
synthetic biology?

#### Non-State actors fail to develop biological weapons

[‌Some policymakers and [analysts have expressed concern that]{.mark}
weaknesses in responses to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic will motivate [terrorists]{.mark} to [seek bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons. However]{.mark}]{.underline}, an examination of the Islamic
State (IS) and al-Qaeda narratives about the pandemic reveals [**[no
causal relationship]{.mark}** between the pandemic and any heightened
interest in biological weapons]{.underline}. A review of [[the
historical pursuit]{.mark} of biological weapons by the IS and by
al-Qaeda [reveals]{.mark} that both [groups]{.mark} evinced some
interest, but [ultimately]{.mark} each [employed conventional]{.mark}
forms of [attack]{.mark} instead.]{.underline} Despite limited IS use of
chemical agents that challenged the taboo against the use of poison as a
weapon, [[there are **formidable hurdles** that nonstate actors must
clear to develop, produce, and use biological agents as
weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although [[the prospect]{.mark} of the IS and al-Qaeda pursuing
biological weapons is not zero, it [is unlikely]{.mark}, [given]{.mark}
both the difficulties and the much [easier]{.mark} and readily available
[**alternatives** that meet their]{.mark} deadly
[objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the wake of the pandemic, several
measures can enhance capabilities to address both public health and
military challenges. These [[**measures** reduce the possibility]{.mark}
of and improve the response to a future naturally occurring pandemic
while also helping to deter, prevent, and respond to any possible
terrorist acquisition and use of biological weapons]{.underline}.
Focusing unduly on the potential, but unlikely[, terrorist use of
biological materials as weapons skews resources to unique military and
counterterrorism measures and away from measures that are useful in both
events. In the post-pandemic period, governments need to rebalance their
efforts.]{.underline}

Key Findings

Looking at both the historical baselines and the pandemic-era narratives
of the [IS and al-Qaeda, neither group seems likely to use biological
materials in future attacks as a consequence of the global COVID-19
pandemic]{.underline}

[[It is unlikely that an actor]{.mark} with only modest knowledge [can
access the necessary materials and fashion a]{.mark} biological
[weapon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The prospects of an individual or a group successfully accomplishing all
the necessary steps are not zero, but given the difficulty involved in
developing such weapons and the fact that conventional weapon
alternatives are readily available, nonstate actors have routinely
chosen other means of attack.

Even such terrorist groups as the IS and al-Qaeda, which have not
hesitated to commit terrible acts of violence, have not demonstrated a
concerted effort to develop biological weapons, and their chemical
weapon activities have thus far been much less deadly than their
conventional weapon attacks.

COVID-19 and the effects of global climate change are stern prompts to
reimagine threats to national and international security

Prioritizing threats is a difficult task, particularly when threats are
novel.

Although individuals and reports issued warnings about the possibility
of a pandemic, other near-term or long-feared postulated threats took
precedent.

[Slow-moving and naturally occurring events rarely get the same
attention as hostile states or terrorist groups, and feared "bolt from
the blue" attacks from states or terrorists have tended to dominate the
thinking of political leaders and national security
experts.]{.underline}

## China neg

### China not rising fast enough

#### U.S. already has the biotech edge, not falling behind in terms of competitiveness

Scott **Moore '21**, February 17, a lecturer in political science at the
University of Pennsylvania and previously served at the U.S. Department
of State, where he worked on the Paris Agreement, "In Biotech, the
Industry of the Future, the U.S. Is Way Ahead of China," LAWFARE,
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-94-024-2086-9.pdf

It was supposed to be China's moment of technological triumph---one that
would show the world Beijing had not only conquered the coronavirus but
also emerged as a biotechnology superpower. But when clinical data on
China's flagship CoronaVac vaccine finally flowed in, they showed it was
barely more than 50 percent effective---just clearing the minimum
standard set by the World Health Organization. In contrast, not one but
two vaccines developed by U.S. firms have been found to be upward of 95
percent effective, a standard no other country's vaccines have yet met
in rigorous clinical trials. The [United States's]{.underline} overall
track record in responding to the pandemic has been awful. Yet the
[success of its vaccine development efforts shows that [when it comes to
biotechnology]{.mark}, the industry of the future, the [**U.S. is way
ahead** of China and]{.mark} most of its [other
rivals]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[A continuing refrain from Washington in recent years has been that the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} falling
[behind]{.mark} China in the development of critical emerging
technologies. **[In some fields]{.mark}**, this may be true. **[But
not]{.mark} in [biotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}. To be sure,
[China's biotech sector is growing at a torrid pace]{.underline}, and
some of its firms are becoming leaders in certain areas, such as cancer
treatment. [Yet [the U.S. retains a dominant position in research,
development and commercialization, accounting for]{.mark} almost **[half
of all biotech patents]{.mark} filed from 1999 to 2013**. The [triumph
of its]{.mark} biotechnology industry during the [corona]{.mark}virus
pandemic, producing two highly effective [vaccines]{.mark} using an
entirely new approach based on messenger RNA, and in record time, [shows
that the U.S.'s competitive edge in biotechnology remains]{.mark}
largely [intact]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [[that has]{.mark} important
[implications]{.mark}]{.underline} as Washington gears up
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} a sustained period of [[geopolitical
competition]{.underline}]{.mark} with Beijing.

### China coop not conflict

#### Biotechnology will produce US-China cooperation, not conflict

**Moore and Coplin '22**, April 8. Scott Moore is Director of China
Programs and Strategic Initiatives and Lecturer in Political Science at
the University of Pennsylvania, where he teaches Chinese politics,
Abigail Coplin is an Assistant Professor of Sociology and Science,
Technology, and Society at Vassar College. Her research analyzes the
development of China's biotechnology and agrobiotechnology. "Closing the

Analina

Yet at the same time, [[Washington and Beijing have good reasons to
see]{.mark} certain areas of [biotech]{.mark}nology [as grounds for
**cooperation rather than conflict or
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [most [advanced]{.mark} areas of
[biotech]{.mark}nology, like gene editing and synthetic biology, [are
double-edged swords]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They show great promise to
help cure chronic diseases and develop drought-resistant crops, but also
to create dangerous new viruses, human genetic modifications, and even
genetically-engineered terrorism.]{.underline} [The [risks and
threats]{.mark} posed by these emerging biotechnologies [cannot be
confined to any one country]{.mark}.]{.underline} Potentially [dangerous
biotechnology research can be undertaken virtually anywhere, meaning
that [all countries need to develop]{.mark} and enforce [rules]{.mark}
preventing research that could create new viruses or bioweapons, for
example. [China is an especially important player in international
biosafety and biosecurity]{.mark}, and the country's 2020 legislation on
both topics is, on paper at least, among the most stringent in the
world.]{.underline} Gene therapy trials based on somatic editing are
underway in both the U.S. and China, and as researchers in both
countries begin to tinker with the fundamental building blocks of life,
engagement on the use of these groundbreaking, but potentially
dangerous, technologies is needed both to ensure transparency as well as
to begin the difficult process of establishing mutually-agreed rules and
norms.

### China hegemony defense

#### Chinese hegemony has structural limitations

Andrew **Nathan \'22**, March/April, Class of 1919 Professor of
Political Science at Columbia University, \"A Rival of America's Making?
The Debate Over Washington's China Strategy,\" FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-11/china-strategy-rival-americas-making

[The country's geographic position is also unfavorable. Along its land
and sea borders, [China confronts distrustful neighbors]{.mark}. Among
them are seven of the 15 most populous countries in the
world]{.underline} (India, Indonesia, Japan, Pakistan, the Philippines,
Russia, and Vietnam) and five countries with which China has fought wars
within the past 80 years (India, Japan, Russia, South Korea, and
Vietnam). [[None]{.mark} of China's neighbors [is culturally]{.mark}
Chinese [or ideologically aligned with the Chinese]{.mark} Communist
Party]{.underline}. All may cooperate with China at various times and to
varying degrees for strategic or economic reasons, but [[all seek to
**hedge against** Chinese domination]{.underline}]{.mark}, [often by
cultivating relations with the United States. As Chinese behavior has
become more assertive, this [counterbalancing]{.mark} behavior [is
growing more evident]{.mark}. India has compromised its traditional
strategic autonomy in order to participate in joint military exercises
with Australia, Japan, and the United States as part of the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, known as the Quad. Japan has taken the
unprecedented step of officially declaring stability in the Taiwan
Strait to be a national interest. And Australia has reaffirmed its U.S.
alliance by accepting help in acquiring nuclear-powered submarines under
the 2021 AUKUS agreement. [China is unlikely to achieve]{.mark} anything
like [hegemony]{.mark} over any but the smallest of its
neighbors.]{.underline}

Geography helps explain another Chinese weakness: its lack of allies
other than North Korea. There are [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} that
are nearby enough to receive substantial help from China in the case of
a military conflict, but they all [[fear China more than they fear any
other state]{.underline}]{.mark}. The lack of allies is more a liability
than an asset, for it deprives China of ways to multiply the pressure it
can put on uncooperative neighbors and of the ability to position
sizable military forces around the world. To be sure, none of the United
States' 60-some allies and partners has interests identical to
Washington's. None can be counted on to follow every component of U.S.
strategy toward China. [But U.S. alliances and partnerships still
complicate China's military calculations, increase the pressure on
Beijing to comply with the international norms preferred by other
states, and expand the alternatives available to countries considering
whether to accept Chinese investments]{.underline}.

[[Nor is the structural distribution of international power favorable to
Chinese global dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Barring catastrophic
mismanagement by other states, [[China will continue to face]{.mark}
five [powerful rivals]{.mark}---India, Japan, Russia, the United States,
and the European Union---[in a multipolar system that is not going to
disappear. A unipolar moment]{.mark}, if one ever really existed,
**[cannot be re-created]{.mark}**, not by the United States and
certainly not [by China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### China war defense

#### War with China won't go nuclear

Andrew **Nathan \'22**, March/April, Class of 1919 Professor of
Political Science at Columbia University, \"A Rival of America's Making?
The Debate Over Washington's China Strategy,\" FOREIGN AFFAIRS,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-11/china-strategy-rival-americas-making

THREAT PERCEPTION

[[The challenge the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [faces from
China is bad enough without exaggerating]{.mark} it]{.underline}. As
realism would predict, Beijing is dissatisfied with the status quo: it
is closely hemmed in by Washington's allies, partners, and military
forces; its supply lines are vulnerable to U.S. interdiction; and its
society is influenced by American culture. [China wants to push the
United States away from its shores and weaken its alliances, and this
means a real chance of [conflict]{.mark}, especially over Taiwan. I
agree with Mearsheimer that if such a war occurred, it **[would probably
be a limited war]{.mark}**,]{.underline} albeit highly destructive and
tragic. I also agree that it would have the
potential---**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** a great one, but more than
zero---to escalate to [[a nuclear exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[But [Mearsheimer is wrong to describe China's determination]{.mark} to
gain control over Taiwan [as]{.mark} either "[emotional" or
"expansionist]{.mark}]{.underline}," because these descriptors make
China sound irrationally aggressive. Mearsheimer's own theory of
[realism better explains why Beijing will not lose its appetite for
Taiwan, given the long-standing legal basis of its sovereignty claim and
the island's strategic, economic, and technological importance to
Chinese security]{.underline}. Also consistent with realism is China's
preference for avoiding a premature strike on Taiwan and instead
deterring Taiwanese independence as long as it takes to achieve what
Beijing calls "peaceful reunification." But deterring Taiwanese
independence has meant that China has had to build up military assets
capable of threatening the aircraft carriers and forward air and naval
bases that the United States has long relied on to stave off any attempt
to take Taiwan by force. The result: a U.S.-Chinese arms race that
raises the risk of war through miscalculation.

And Mearsheimer is wrong to describe Beijing's goal as global dominance.
In a multipolar world, China will seek to shape global institutions to
its advantage, just as major powers have always done. But it has no
proposal for an alternative, Beijing-dominated set of institutions. It
remains strongly committed to the global free-trade regime, as well as
to the UN and that organization's alphabet soup of agencies. It
participates actively in the UN human rights system in order to help its
allies and frustrate its rivals. Its Belt and Road Initiative operates
alongside, rather than in place of, long-standing Western-funded
development programs. [[China seeks influence]{.mark}, but it has little
prospect of dominance as long as other powers also stay active in these
institutions]{.underline}.

[Overestimating the China threat is just as dangerous as underestimating
it]{.underline}. [**[Hyping the hazard]{.mark}** makes it harder to
manage, by creating panic among both the American public and Chinese
policymakers. Whether or not engagement [was the mistake]{.mark} that
Mearsheimer claims, whether or not there was ever an option to constrain
China's growth as he believes, we are where we are]{.underline}. I agree
with Mearsheimer that what the United States must do now is manage the
situation---which should mean not exacerbating what is already, on cold
realist grounds, a serious challenge.

### Econ defense

#### Economic collapse doesn't cause war 

Daniel **Drezner '14**, January, professor of International Law at
Tufts, The System Worked: Global Economic Governance during the Great
Recession, World Politics, Volume 66. Number 1, online

The final significant outcome addresses [a dog that hasn\'t barked: the
effect of the Great Recession on cross-border conflict and violence.
During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple [analysts asserted
that]{.mark} the [financial crisis would lead states to increase their
use of force]{.mark}]{.underline} [as a tool for staying in
power]{.underline}.42 [[They voiced]{.mark} genuine [concern
that]{.mark} the **global [economic downturn]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}
lead to an [increase]{.mark} in conflict---whether through greater
internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a
[ratcheting]{.mark} up of great power conflict]{.underline}. Violence in
the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and even the
disruptions of the Occupy movement fueled impressions of a surge in
global public disorder.

[**The [aggregate data suggest otherwise]{.mark}**, however. The
Institute for Economics and Peace has concluded that \"[the average
level of peacefulness]{.mark} in 2012 [is approximately the same]{.mark}
as it was in 2007.\"43 [Interstate violence]{.mark} in particular has
[**declined** since the start of the financial crisis, as have military
expenditures]{.mark} in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm
that]{.underline} [[the Great Recession has not triggered]{.mark} any
increase in [violent conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Lotta Themner and
Peter Wallensteen conclude: [\"\[[T\]he pattern is one of relative
stability]{.mark} when we consider the trend for the past five
years]{.underline}.\"44 [The]{.underline} secular [decline in violence
that started with the end of the Cold War has not been
reversed]{.underline}. Rogers Brubaker observes that \"[the crisis has
not]{.underline} to date [generated the surge in protectionist
nationalism or ethnic exclusion that might have been
expected]{.underline}.\"45

#### No diversionary war.

Political Scandals? Cross-National Experiments on Diversionary Action in

[**[The diversionary theory of war]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} one of the
[best-known]{.mark} conflict initiation theories focusing on democratic
leaders' incentives. According to the theory]{.underline}, democratic
[leaders]{.underline} who face greater electoral challenges, either
[[due to]{.mark} political scandals or an **[economic
downturn]{.mark}**]{.underline}, are more likely to [choose provocative
foreign policies and seek to lead the country into diplomatic crises, in
hopes of inciting nationalistic sentiments]{.underline} that will boost
their approval ratings via the so-called "rally around the flag" effect
(e.g. Gaines 2002; Hetherington and Nelson 2003; Mueller 1973).

[**[Despite]{.mark} the [intuitive appeal]{.mark}** of this
theory,]{.underline} [[**empirical studies** have been largely unable to
find consistent evidence]{.mark} to corroborate the purported
theoretical mechanisms]{.underline}. Findings from observational studies
have been quite mixed. The fact that a [diverse]{.underline} set of
[findings]{.underline} have been reported from observational studies
[suggests that [**unobservable confounders** arising from strategic
interactions greatly hinder our ability to tease out the causal
effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of electoral hardship on conflict behaviors.

[In this research note, we claim that [the key assumption of the theory
does not work]{.mark} as expected. That is, [a]{.mark} political [leader
cannot divert attention]{.mark}]{.underline} from his/her political
scandals [[by]{.mark} [emphasizing a foreign threat]{.mark} and alerting
the general public that the country may go to war against an enemy.
Although [the assumptions]{.mark} that the threat or use of force is
salient and that an acute enemy threat would create a
rally-around-the-flag effect are common, they [have rarely been
tested]{.mark} at a micro-level in an experimental setting. Our team
conducted a cross-national experiment to find out whether and how
political leaders could divert the public's attention away from their
political scandals]{.underline}.

### Nuclear war defense

#### Conflicts won't go nuclear -- use-it-or-lose-it is a fallacy

**Kroenig**, Mathew, Professor in the department of government at
Georgetown, **Winter 2021** ("Will Emerging Technology Cause Nuclear
War?: Bringing Geopolitics Back In", Air University, Winter, 2021,
<https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-15_Issue-4/D-Kroenig.pdf>,
accessed 6/27/22, ,FLC)

There are several limitations, however, to the existing analysis. First,
the underlying theory of nuclear conflict this body of thought advances
is debatable. [It rests heavily on the "use it or lose it" cause of
nuclear war, but use it or lose it is rooted in the logical fallacy of
the false dilemma]{.underline}.12 [States have many options in a crisis
other than suffering a disarming nuclear attack or launching
one]{.underline}. Moreover, faced with a range of choices[, the
use-it-or-lose-it logic assumes a state will intentionally choose to
initiate a nuclear war---the most risky and costly available
option.]{.underline} [The use-it-or-lose-it pathway to nuclear war,
therefore, is in tension with mainstream nuclear deterrence theory that
maintains states will be reluctant to conduct a deliberate attack on
another nuclear-armed state.13]{.underline}

A second limitation of this approach is that theories of nuclear
instability developed in the early days of the Cold War are in tension
with current understandings of the causes of war in contemporary
international relations theory. The nuclear stability framework rests on
the notion that parity in the balance of power is associated with peace.
[The prevailing bargaining model of war, however, maintains that parity
contributes to uncertainty about the balances of power and resolve,
which hinders efforts to reach negotiated settlements short of armed
conflict.]{.underline}14 [The empirical record supports this theory and
demonstrates parity in the balance of power is associated with conflict,
and uneven balances of power are associated with peace]{.underline}.15
Situations of obvious strategic nuclear superiority, therefore, may be
more stable than situations of strategic parity.

## Democracy NEG

### Democracy doesn't solve stuff

#### Democracy is overrated -- accountability is not proven nor is solvency for war

Daniel **Larison '12**, PhD in history from the University of Chicago,
"Democratic Peace Theory Is False," THE AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE,
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/democratic-peace-theory-is-false/

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.
Regardless, [[democratic peace theory draws **broad conclusions** from a
short period in modern history with very few cases]{.mark} before the
20th century. [The core]{.mark} of democratic peace
[theory]{.mark}]{.underline} as I understand it [[is that democratic
governments are **more accountable**]{.mark} **to their
populations**]{.underline}, [and because the people will bear the costs
of the war [they are]{.mark} going to be [less willing to support a
war]{.mark} policy. This supposedly keeps democratic states from waging
wars against one another [because of]{.mark} the built-in electoral and
[institutional checks]{.mark} on government power]{.underline}. One
small problem with [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} is that it [[is
**rubbish**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[**[Democracies in antiquity fought against one another]{.mark}**.
Political [equality and voting do not abolish **conflicts of
interest**]{.mark} **between competing states**. [Democratic peace
theory doesn't account for]{.mark} the effects of **[nationalist and
imperialist ideologies]{.mark}** on the way democratic nations think
about war. [Democratic nations]{.mark} that [have]{.mark} professional
[armies]{.mark} to do the fighting for them are [often enthusiastic
about]{.mark} overseas [wars]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Conservative-Unionist government that waged the South African War
(against two states with elected governments, I might add) enjoyed great
popular support and won a huge majority in the "Khaki" election that
followed.

As long as it goes well and doesn't have too many costs, [war can be
quite popular, and [even if the war is costly it may still be
popular]{.mark} if it is fought for nationalist reasons that appeal to a
majority of the public]{.underline}. If the public is whipped into
thinking that there is an intolerable foreign threat or if they believe
that their country can gain something at relatively low cost by going to
war, the type of government they have really is irrelevant. Unless a
democratic public believes that a military conflict will go badly for
their military, they may be ready to welcome the outbreak of a war that
they expect to win. [Setting aside the flaws and failures of U.S.-led
democracy promotion for a moment, **[the idea that reducing the number
of non-democracies makes war less likely is just fantasy]{.mark}**.
Clashing interests between states aren't going away, and the more
democratic states there are in the world the more likely it is that two
or more of them will eventually fight one another.]{.underline}

#### Best research shows democracy doesn't produce peace

Jeff **Grabmeier '15**. Senior Director, Research communications, Media
& PR "'Democratic peace\' may not prevent international conflict,"
https://phys.org/news/2015-09-democratic-peace-international-conflict.html

[[Using a new technique to analyze 52 years of international conflict,
researchers suggest that there may be **no such thing as a \"democratic
peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

In addition, [[a model developed with this]{.mark} new [technique was
found to predict international conflict]{.mark} five and even ten years
in the future **[better than any existing model]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Democratic peace is the widely held theory that democracies are less
likely to go to war against each other than countries with other types
of government]{.underline}.

[In the new study, researchers found that economic [trade relationships
and]{.mark} participation in international governmental [organizations
play a strong role in keeping]{.mark} the [peace]{.mark} among
countries. **[But democracy? Not so much]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\"**[That\'s a startling finding]{.underline}** because the value of
joint democracy in preventing war is what we thought was the closest
thing to a law in international politics,\" said Skyler Cranmer, lead
author of the study and The Carter Phillips and Sue Henry Associate
Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University.

\"[There\'s been empirical [research supporting this theory]{.mark} for
the past 50 years. Even U.S. presidents have touted the value of a
democratic peace, but it **[doesn\'t seem to hold
up]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least the way we looked at it.\"

### NATO bad

#### NATO is obsolete -- technology is not a game-changer

Simon **Jenkins '18**, June 12, Guardian columnist, "Donald Trump is
right. Nato is a costly white elephant," THE GUARDIAN,
<https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/12/donald-trump-nato-costly-white-elephant-russia>

I regard Trump as an aberration, a temporary trauma afflicting US
politics. He honours the thesis of the historian Arthur Schlesinger,
that America's constitution often drives the republic to the abyss, only
to drag it back again. But even monsters can ask the occasional good
question. Thus Trump this week on Nato, a body so mired in platitude and
waffle it has lost sight of its true purpose. Trump wants to know what
Europe really regards as its defence policy, for he thinks it takes
America for a ride. [[Nato was founded in 1949]{.mark} in response to
Stalin's blockade of Berlin]{.underline}. It was meant to "keep the
Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down". Since then,
it has welcomed the American nuclear shield, at vast cost to America.
Otherwise, [[its only military achievements have been the breakup of
Yugoslavia and the loss of]{.mark} a squalid 17-year war in
[Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Neither has anything to do with the
North Atlantic. Nothing better symbolised this than Theresa May's
bizarre gift to Trump this week of 450 British troops for Kabul.

Nato was about deterring an attack on Europe from Russia. In 1945, the
west agreed the Potsdam settlement, accepting the Soviets' "sphere of
influence" over eastern Europe. Thus when Russia invaded Hungary in 1956
and Czechoslovakia in 1968, there was no question of Nato, or Europe,
retaliating. The iron curtain was iron.

Come 1989 and the collapse of Potsdam Europe, Nato did not approach a
broken Russia to agree some new settlement. It did the opposite. To
protests from Russia's weakened leader, Boris Yeltsin, it gathered
former Warsaw Pact states under its wing and advanced its border east
towards Russia. It embraced Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, then the
Baltic states, Romania and Bulgaria. It was like Khrushchev stationing
missiles in Cuba. Only Germany counselled caution.

Nato's provocation was so blatant as to be an open invitation to any new
populist leader in Moscow to exploit Russia's bruised patriotism: hence
Vladimir Putin. He and his kleptocratic cronies are virtually a Nato
creation. But the fact that America was party to the provocation does
not invalidate Trump's question. What is Nato's policy beyond needling
Russia and feebly relying on the American shield?

It is astonishing that, three decades after 1989, Europe is almost back
to a cold war with Moscow. As winner of the last war, Nato was primarily
responsible for lowering tension and making peace. Instead it revelled
in victory. If Europe wants to hire an America nuclear shield, it should
deal with America over how to pay for it. But the current tit-for-tat
hostilities with Russia are playing with fire, and counterproductive.
[[Europe's land forces are]{.underline}]{.mark} so
[[weak]{.underline}]{.mark} they would be wiped out by Russia in a
matter of days. So is Europe really expecting Washington to order a
nuclear barrage against Russian "grey area" incursions into the Baltics,
let alone a conflict with Orbán's Hungary or Erdoğan's Turkey -- both
Nato members?

This is not realistic, any more than was American intervention during
Russia's incursion in Ukraine or Georgia. That is why Orbán and Erdoğan
are wisely cosying up to Putin. **[[Nato is adrift of
realpolitik]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Trump is effectively telling Europe that its [**[Nato is as outdated as
the Congress of Vienna]{.mark}** by the time of Bismarck. He is wrong to
rabbit on about [spending]{.mark} 2% or 4% of GDP [on weapons]{.mark}.
This [helps no one]{.mark} but the defence industries -- spending should
meet plausible threat, not some vague budget target. But [no more
helpful is Europe's belligerent posturing]{.mark} towards Moscow, such
as Britain's reaction to the mysterious Wiltshire
poisonings]{.underline}. Entrenching Putin behind a siege economy is not
a defence policy.

#### NATO doesn't fund their military enough to be useful 

Christian **Whiton '18**, July 6, Senior Fellow at the Center for the
National Interest, "NATO Is Obsolete" THE NATIONAL INTEREST,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/nato-obsolete-25167?page=0%2C1

[After the alliance was established in 1949, its first secretary
general, Lord Hastings Ismay, summed up its purpose concisely: "to keep
the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down." The
unofficial mission matched the time well]{.underline}: Western Europe's
postwar future was clouded by the prospect of a Soviet invasion,
American insularity, or German militarism---all possible given the
preceding decades of history.

[Nearly seventy years later, none of these concerns still
exist]{.underline}. Furthermore, NATO\'s opposing alliance during the
Cold War, the Warsaw Pact, quit the Soviet Bloc in 1989, and the Soviet
Union itself passed into history in 1991---twenty-seven years ago.

Despite endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive burden
on U.S. taxpayers, **[[NATO has failed to be of much
use]{.underline}]{.mark}** since then. As its boosters like to remind
us, after 9/11, the alliance invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense
provision on our behalf. But action from America's allies did not follow
the grandiose gesture---the NATO mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on
U.S. forces and effectively failed.

[Today, [the alliance's bureaucrats and]{.mark} some member states
spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the organization
alive]{.underline}, along with a laundry list of "train and equip"
missions.

[Yet NATO [members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a real sense of
danger from]{.mark} Russia or [anyone]{.mark} else. Among the
twenty-nine members, only the United States is really serious about its
Article 3 obligations to defend itself, spending approximately \$700
billion or 3.5 percent of its GDP on defense. No other NATO member comes
close to this proportion, and [the vast majority fail]{.mark} even [to
meet the modest]{.mark}, self-imposed [requirement to devote]{.mark} at
least [2 percent of GDP to defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### GLO defense

#### International liberal order is overhyped and chock full of falsities

Patrick **Porter '18**, June 5, "A World Imagined: Nostalgia and Liberal
Order," CATO,
https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/world-imagined-nostalgia-liberal-order

According to a view popular in Washington, D.C., and other capitals
around the world, the United States used its power and idealism for more
than 70 years to create a security and economic order that transformed
the world. This world order was liberal because the United States was
liberal. "Liberal" in this context means the pursuit of security both
through the spread of liberty, in the form of free markets and
democratic constitutions, and the rule of law, in the form of rule‐​based
international institutions. Today, defenders of that order fear that
President Trump and a set of regressive forces are laying waste to it.
They claim the consequences are grave: we are witnessing the "end of the
West as we know it,"1 the abandonment of "global leadership" by its
"long‐​time champion,"2 and a "coming Dark Age."3 Foreign Affairs, the
house organ of the foreign policy establishment, recently asked 32
experts whether the "liberal order is in peril." Most agreed it is, with
26 respondents registering a confidence level of 7 out of 10.4 Alarmed
by the political tumult of our time, [[nostalgists]{.underline}]{.mark}
recall the post‐​1945 moment [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [institution
building and [benign internationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and call for
its reclamation.

They [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[in the **grip of a
fiction**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Liberalism and liberal projects
abounded in the past 70 years. But [the dream of a unitary, integrated
global system]{.mark} organized around liberalism [is
**ahistorical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In truth, the pre‐​Trump world was
a more brutal and messy place than the nostalgia allows. To be sure,
there was liberalism, and it did help define postwar international
relations. Broadly speaking, the post‐​1945 period was, on many measures,
more prosperous, less violent, and more collaborative than what came
before. One defect of "[[liberal order" nostalgia]{.underline}]{.mark}
is that it [[exaggerates]{.mark} these [qualities and]{.mark} simply
[leaves out]{.mark} too [many contrary]{.mark} historical
[realities]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other critics have already noted the
gap between nostalgia and history and that the postwar world was never
"whole." At times the liberal order was neither very liberal nor very
orderly. There may be "islands of liberal order, but they are floating
in a sea of something quite different."5

Not only do nostalgists get the history wrong, they fail to confront
what "world ordering" actually entails. The main critique in this paper
is that [[the fetish for "liberal order" has obscured what is
involved]{.mark} in the process of "ordering" --- or attempting to order
--- the globe]{.underline}. The United States, as the leading actor in
the orthodox narrative, emerges as a power that created order through a
benign internationalist vision, consensus building, and institution
creating. But the [[successes and failures]{.mark} of that order also
[flowed from coercion]{.mark}, compromise, and rougher power
politics]{.underline}. As the ordering superpower, the United States did
not bind itself with the rules of the system. It upended, stretched, or
broke liberal rules to shape a putatively liberal order. Appeals to the
myth of a liberal Camelot flow from a deeper myth, of power politics
without coercion and empire without imperialism.

This fuller narrative is also a story of tragic limits. The world was
not so easily subjugated. Efforts to spread liberalism often contained
the seeds of illiberalism. Multiple orders collided and met the limits
of their reach and power. [Efforts to create a [liberal order ended up
accommodating illiberalism]{.mark}. Liberalism itself proved to be a
conflicted thing. At times, [projects]{.mark} to advance it [had
unexpected results]{.mark}]{.underline}. As it happens, the pursuit of
"[[liberal order" is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}**
just [[an antidote]{.underline}]{.mark} to the current difficulties
suffered by the international system but a source of them.

Ideas about "order" matter and have weighty policy implications. Just as
material power enables or forecloses certain choices, ideas condition
and constrain a country's grand strategic decisions. Those who lament
the fall of the "liberal order" are saying, in effect, that some ideas
are illegitimate and should be off the table. They worry that "populism"
and "isolationism" endanger traditional ideas that were once dominant,
leading America to abandon its manifold commitments overseas, in turn
driving the world into disorder. When they call for the reclamation of
the old order, they also call for the perpetuation of American primacy.
By contrast, this paper argues that the exaggerated notion of [[the
"liberal order" and its imminent collapse is a myth]{.mark} of the
foreign policy establishment]{.underline} and leads America to
overstretch.

#### LIO is ineffective especially when led by the U.S.

Amitav **Acharya '20**, January 14. "Hegemony and Diversity in the
'Liberal International Order': Theory and Reality," E-INTERNATIONAL
RELATIONS,
https://www.e-ir.info/2020/01/14/hegemony-and-diversity-in-the-liberal-international-order-theory-and-reality/

Most analysts attribute the uncertain fate of the Liberal International
Order (hereafter [[LIO]{.underline}]{.mark}) to the global power shift,
anti-globalization sentiments, and the rise of populist leaders
spearheaded by Donald Trump. But the [[crisis has longer and wider
roots]{.underline}]{.mark} in what might be called the
hegemony-diversity gap at the heart of the LIO. Supporters present the
LIO as an inclusive order offering substantial material benefits to the
world while remaining open to participation by all (Deudney and
Ikenberry, 1999). Yet, the LIO is also cast as a hegemonic order, both
as a product of US (or US-led Western) hegemony and as the dominant
world order with no real alternatives. This [[simultaneous aspiration
for diversity and hegemony creates a **fundamental tension at the heart
of the LIO**]{.mark}, especially [in the non-Western world]{.mark},
where [the LIO is]{.mark} often [perceived as a narrow ideological,
economic and strategic framework reflecting and advancing the
interests]{.mark} and identity [of]{.mark} the [Western nations led by
the US]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The LIO's]{.mark} performance
[legitimacy]{.mark} from the material benefits it offered to rising
powers like China and India [is **undercut**]{.mark} by its normative
legitimacy deficit in a world of political and cultural
diversity]{.underline}. Meanwhile, in Western nations like the US, [[the
benefits of the LIO]{.mark} offered abroad [have become a source of
**resentment**]{.mark} at home]{.underline}, thereby compounding the
challenge to the LIO. This article focuses on the LIO's relationship
with the non-Western (Global South, postcolonial) world, and argues that
as the LIO loses its presumed "hegemony", instead of claiming to
"co-opt" the Rest, we must embrace the realities of a culturally and
political diverse world.

### Climate defense

#### Oceans prove climate change cannot be fixed

Damian **Carrington '22**, February 1, "Extreme heat in oceans 'passed
point of no return' in 2014," THE GUARDIAN,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/01/extreme-heat-oceans-passed-point-of-no-return-high-temperatures-wildlife-seas

[[Extreme heat in the world's oceans passed the "point of no return" in
2014 and has become the new normal]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to
research.

[[Scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} analysed sea surface temperatures over
the last 150 years, which have risen because of global heating. They
[[found that extreme temperatures occurring just 2% of the time a
century ago have occurred at least 50% of the time]{.mark} across the
global ocean [since 2014]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In some hotspots, extreme temperatures occur 90% of the time, severely
affecting wildlife. [More than [90% of the heat trapped by greenhouse
gases is absorbed by the ocean, which plays a critical role in
maintaining a stable climate]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"By using this measure of extremes, we've shown that **[[climate change
is not something that]{.mark} is uncertain and [may happen in the
distant future -- it's]{.mark} something that is [a historical fact and
has occurred already]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Kyle Van Houtan, at
the Monterey Bay Aquarium, US, and one of the research team. "[Extreme
[climate change is here, it's in the ocean]{.mark}, and the ocean
underpins all life on Earth]{.underline}."

#### Aggressive action can't solve

VIVAN **SORAB '19**, MARCH 26, "Too Little, Too Late? Carbon Emissions
and the Point of No Return," YALE ENVIRONMENT REVIEW,
<https://environment-review.yale.edu/too-little-too-late-carbon-emissions-and-point-no-return>

A recent study asks a related but hitherto unaddressed question: [[how
long do policymakers have to dramatically reduce fossil fuel
consumption]{.underline}]{.mark} to meet the Paris Agreement's 2 degree
target? Using the turn of the century as a benchmark, the study analyzes
when action would be necessary to ensure that in 2100 the world would
meet the Paris Agreement's target. [[Scientists]{.underline}]{.mark}
from the Universities of Oxford, UK, and Utrecht, The Netherlands
[outline what they call the Point of No Return]{.underline}, the year
after which [[even aggressive policy measures would be unlikely
to]{.mark} meet the Paris Agreement's goal by the end of the
century]{.underline}. Unlike previous studies, this research adds risk
to the picture: how would the risk tolerance of policymakers [[affect
the Point of No Return]{.underline}]{.mark}?

### Leadership in Europe fails

#### U.S. hegemony in Europe is not sustainable

Muhittin **Ataman '21**, September 19, "Global leadership crisis: The
U.S. hegemony vs. China," DAILY SABAH,
https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/columns/global-leadership-crisis-the-us-hegemony-vs-china

Today's world is in both a comprehensive transition and a deep crisis.
Not only do rivalries and enmities abound but [today's [alliances
are]{.mark}]{.underline} also [quite **[vulnerable]{.mark}**. The
survival, [duration and sustainability]{.mark} of all these
alliances]{.underline}, rivalries and conflicts [[are in
question]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words, [neither conflicting nor
[cooperative relations]{.mark} are sustainable over the long term. All
foreign policy activities [are]{.mark} conducted [on slippery
ground]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is, [the direction and pace of any
relationship may change at any time]{.underline}.

Therefore, when we analyze the current global balance of power, we have
to take these conditions into consideration. No global power pursues a
principled foreign policy orientation. Most [countries follow an
eclectic, sectoral and compartmentalized foreign policy]{.underline}. In
this piece, I want to briefly analyze the current foreign relations
tendencies of certain global powers.

Leadership crisis

[[Even though the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [is]{.mark} the
most powerful, [influential]{.mark} and important international actor,
[it faces difficulties in maintaining]{.mark} its global
[leadership]{.mark}. As U.S. [relations]{.mark} with other leading
global powers [are in flux]{.mark}, **[U.S. relations with its European
allies are not sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The U.S. is neither
comfortable with the current pace of global relations, nor it is able to
change the pace of these events to accommodate its national
interests]{.underline}.

#### US-EU cooperation no longer functions -- the two aren't key to each other

Muhittin **Ataman '21**, September 19, "Global leadership crisis: The
U.S. hegemony vs. China," DAILY SABAH,
https://www.dailysabah.com/opinion/columns/global-leadership-crisis-the-us-hegemony-vs-china

On the other hand, the [[steps taken by the U.S. in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark} region]{.underline} both [directly and indirectly
**[undermine its trans-Atlantic allegiances]{.mark}**. It seems that its
[European/NATO allies will be of lesser importance]{.mark} for the U.S.
[for the foreseeable future]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, it will
continue to cooperate with European countries against the perceived
threat from Russia, still the main \"other\" of the NATO alliance.

**[The [relations between the U.S. and European Union are increasingly
problematic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [There are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[brief [ups and downs]{.mark}, both alliance and rivalry, in their
relationship. [European countries do not share many concerns with the
U.S. and vice versa]{.mark}. While European countries prioritize their
relations with Russia, the U.S. prioritizes its relations with
China]{.underline}.

### U.S. hegemony unsustainable

#### Multipolarity is inevitable and peaceful -- maintaining U.S. hegemony prompts superpower conflict

Dr. Nadia **Helmy '22**, April 14, "The Chinese theory on "the end of
American hegemony" after the Ukrainian war," MODERN DIPLOMACY,
https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2022/04/14/the-chinese-theory-on-the-end-of-american-hegemony-after-the-ukrainian-war/

From my point of view, in my personal belief that **[[the multipolar
international system has already begun]{.mark} to become
clear]{.underline}**, and before the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian
war in the first place, with its many aspects of applications and
features. We can find the analyses done by the "Harvard University" in
the USA, emphasizing that [China is quickly catching up with the United
States of America in terms of (technology, military and strategic
capabilities), despite the dominance of the United States of America
over international finance and research and development]{.underline}.

Here, China is well aware of the (American desire for global hegemony
and the unilateral system to direct the whole world). Therefore, the
United States of America is concerned about the Chinese and Russian
powers, especially after Russia launched its current attack against
Ukraine, due to the interference of the United States of America and the
West in Russia's spheres of influence, with an attempt Ukraine's
inclusion in NATO, with the realization that China is the second largest
developed economy in the world and has enormous military defense
capabilities, and its Russian ally is a formidable military force that
Washington and its allies in NATO fear, which was evident during the
Ukraine war, as well as regional influence. [[Russia and China together
have intertwined and connected borders and sprawling geographic spaces
internally and externally, in addition to the abundance of resources,
and]{.underline}]{.mark} the most important thing for me is
[[encouraging]{.underline}]{.mark} their citizens to (belief in the idea
of ​​national tide and a sense of [popular
[nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline} and strength globally **[[in the face
of American and Western hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}** to stop and
limit their power and call for their national popular leaders to rally
with their leaders).

[[China is seeking to achieve a high degree of strategic cohesion with
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, with ([[expanding]{.mark} their [alliances
globally between]{.mark} the developing countries of the South, which
are represented in the [African, Arab and Latin American
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}). Therefore, the United States of America
realizes the strength of the alliance and partnership between China and
Russia, and the strong support for each other politically, economically,
militarily and technologically. China has also become more aware that
[through deep political, economic and security cooperation with Russia,
China will ensure the possibility of forming a multipolarity, with the
presence of more than one international and regional pole around the
world, with an emphasis on expanding]{.underline} this through
([encouraging more different developing countries to join their alliance
to reform the current world system]{.underline}, which is dominated by
American policies and undermines the sovereignty of weak and
marginalized countries by interfering in the internal affairs of
countries to ensure their control over them).

We find that in the face of the American economic power, [China and
Russia together represent about 77% of the gross domestic product of the
United States of America]{.underline} alone, in the current value of the
dollar and in comparison to the purchasing power parity of Russia and
China together compared to Washington, [and]{.underline} in addition,
[the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates of America [is]{.mark} now
[burdened with debt]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has increased to reach
about \$30 trillion, with (the US debt ratio exceeds many times the
value and proportion of its GDP, which [[China is well aware
of]{.underline}]{.mark} about the [[decline in US economic power]{.mark}
globally]{.underline}).

In view of the United States of America's understanding of the
indicators and axes of power, China and Russia, [the United States of
America has become **more and more**]{.underline} promoting
**[confrontational]{.underline}** concepts in their confrontation, as
the most **[threatening]{.underline}** countries to **[the
world]{.underline}**. With the American focus on (the issue of the rise
of China and the ideological confrontation with the Communist Party of
China as a civilization different from the West and liberal American and
Western concepts. As a result, Washington has become more eager to
impede and halt Chinese growth in particular and limit the scope and
limits of the partnership and alliance between China and Russia). Which
the Egyptian researcher has carefully analyzed during the
Ukrainian-Russian war, with the American insistence on the need for
China to adopt a clear position on that Russian war against Ukraine, and
Washington's attempt to take strict commitments against China to ensure
that it does not support Russia economically. This is what China and its
communist leaders have become aware of, and are aware of these American
methods to drive a wedge between it and Russia and President "Putin".

[[The whole world is aware that these close relations and alliances
between China and Russia are the cornerstone for establishing and
forming a multipolar international system]{.mark}, in the face of US
policies that are still seeking to preserve their global dominant
uniqueness]{.underline}. Therefore, [[China and Russia
are]{.underline}]{.mark} trying to expand the scope of their
international partnerships through (the Chinese Silk Road, launching
initiatives for development partnership with developing countries of the
South, African, Arab countries, Latin and South American countries),
because success in this strategy is [[enough to
break]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[American hegemony, and]{.mark} is a
basic **[guarantee]{.mark}** for the [transition for a multipolar
world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Here we analyze the impact of the [strategic [mistakes committed by
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} of
America to [**[destabilize the world]{.underline}**, [by increasing the
**intensity of conflict and international
polarization**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as its inability to
modernize the global system, to overcome shortcomings, challenges and
new competitions, but Washington has created many international crises
in large parts of the world, Such as: (Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria,
Venezuela)...etc. And its spending of a large budget that exceeded 8
trillion dollars for the war on terrorism, which proved the extent of
the American failure and impotence in confronting it after its
humiliating withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban movement's
control of the government. These are the internationally [[failed
American policies]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[caused a **state of global
division**]{.underline}]{.mark} in its confrontation.

Therefore, from my point of view, the United States of America is trying
here to (take advantage of the crisis of the current Russian war against
Ukraine to unite the front of NATO and its members in the West in the
face of Russia and President "Putin" under its leadership) to assert its
hegemony and uniqueness globally in the face of China and Russia, which
is what it must be aware of. The countries of the European Union, in
view of the violation by the United States of its covenants and harm to
the interests of its European partners, and the most prominent example
to me of this issue, is the (American signing of the Aukus military
defense agreement with Australia and Britain in the face of France),
which caused the Europeans and France to lose that deal, passing
Washington's interests and its excessive selfishness in dealing with its
European allies by giving preference to its interests over it and
passing it in the face of them, harming them in practice.

On the other hand, [the United States of America failed to adapt to the
changing global economy]{.underline}, unlike China, after a number of
global economic crises, such as: (the Corona virus pandemic, the global
financial crisis in 2008, the Ukraine crisis), and others. Which caused
(millions of American citizens to lose their jobs, especially in the
field of manufacturing and technology), which the United States of
America tried to evade internally by blaming the unfair trade policies
pursued by China internationally in confronting them.

Here we will find the extent of Chinese President Xi Jinping's
insistence, in all his political speeches, to emphasize the concept of
(the common future of humanity), and to emphasize his slogan around (the
Chinese dream), to achieve a well-off society, and to work according to
the principle of mutual benefit for all, and international profit for
all. With President (Xi Jinping's focusing on the path leading to the
realization of this Chinese dream), through three axes, which are: (the
Chinese road, the Chinese spirit, and the Chinese power).

The speeches of Comrade Chinese President "Xi Jinping" are focusing on
the keys and mechanisms for implementing this Chinese dream in an
internationally multipolar world, and the extent to which this is
appropriate for China and the rest of the world. We find that the
essence of implementing this Chinese dream internally is to reach an
internationally multipolar world away from the concepts of American
hegemony. Hence, this Chinese dream of an international multilateral
world has become (the essence of Chinese national identity by seeking to
restore its influence as a force by following China and the ruling
Communist Party leaders for several important policies, including the
axes of development and reform policy plans across China). In the end,
it reflects all (the components of the basic socialist culture and
values ​​of China, as well as that Chinese spirit that is in harmony with
the goals of the Chinese state, the nation and all the Chinese people).

Based on this aforementioned analysis, we can conclude that [[American
hegemony has already ended globally or is on the way to
disappearing]{.mark} or evading, [but **achieving (a stable global
balance of power) is still possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### U.S. hegemony bad

#### Transition away from hegemony in Europe and NATO coop is best for stability

Joshua R. **Shifrinson '21**, January 28, "The Dominance Dilemma: The
American Approach to NATO and its Future," QUINCY BRIEF NO. 8,
https://quincyinst.org/report/the-dominance-dilemma-the-american-approach-to-nato-and-its-future/

In addition, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [faces
diminishing returns, and several negative results, from continuing
its]{.mark} present [approach to NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. The alliance
has now been enlarged to the point where few strategically meaningful
European actors exist outside of NATO's orbit, even as those that exist,
such as Ukraine, would constitute a net loss for U.S. national security
by risking a direct conflict with Moscow. In short, little can be gained
from continued expansion. Likewise, [[as European leaders continue
pressing for greater autonomy]{.mark} from the United States and NATO,
[the U.S. will generate **increased friction** with its allies]{.mark}
if it continues to suppress their initiatives in this
direction]{.underline}. This tension, meanwhile, comes at a time when
[[Europe itself is of diminishing relative importance to an American
grand strategy]{.mark} increasingly fixed on Asia, [as most]{.mark} of
the [actors]{.mark} involved [recognize]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
U.S.--led alliance continues moving toward Russia's borders, it may play
some role in driving Moscow and Beijing to cooperate in international
affairs. In short, U.S. policy in Asia complicates U.S. strategy in
Europe, and vice-versa.

[The United States requires a course correction. [U.S. policy toward
NATO now injects a **large degree of instability**]{.mark} and
unsustainability into the region, which ironically possesses the
preconditions for an unprecedented degree of stability thanks in part to
prior U.S. efforts. In consequence]{.underline}, the
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[should
consider]{.underline}]{.mark} proceeding along four tracks, with the
goal of [**significantly [reducing]{.mark}** the [U.S. security presence
via NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### US could always step back in and stabilize Europe

Joshua R. **Shifrinson '21**, January 28, "The Dominance Dilemma: The
American Approach to NATO and its Future," QUINCY BRIEF NO. 8,
https://quincyinst.org/report/the-dominance-dilemma-the-american-approach-to-nato-and-its-future/

[The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [ought to prepare
for]{.mark} a **[broader recalibration]{.mark}** of political
responsibilities [in Europe]{.mark}. Precisely because the United States
has other domestic and international obligations, and because
[NATO's]{.mark} European [members are increasingly disenchanted with
U.S. predominance]{.mark}, conditions are ripe to empower the European
allies]{.underline}. The objective should be to strengthen
intra--European solidarity and cooperation while the United States steps
back from active management of European security. [The
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [should pivot toward becoming
the **pacifier of last resort** rather than the manager of]{.mark} early
[squabbles]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There are reasons to believe **[[this]{.mark} result [is
attainable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Many of NATO's major European
players, especially France and Germany, have deepened cooperation in
both NATO and non--NATO contexts such as the EU over the past several
decades. [Disenchantment with U.S. dominance and lingering concerns
about Russia provide incentives for sustained cooperation even with a
significantly reduced American presence. The United States ought to lean
into these trends, returning to its vision of the early postwar years by
reducing, limiting, and making more conditional the U.S. presence in the
alliance]{.underline}. Over time, such steps could lay the foundation
for a comprehensive American withdrawal, providing that Europe remains
stable and open to U.S. influence when U.S. interests are involved. Nor
would such a retrenchment sacrifice long-term U.S. interests: [[Should
intra--European tensions spike]{.underline}]{.mark} without an American
pacifier, [America's [lingering connection to the alliance would enable
the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to **reengage as
needed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The Biden administration also provides a window of opportunity to
progress and be ambitious in broadening and regularizing NATO-EU
cooperation in the field of innovation and EDTs.]{.underline} While
political dialogue among their leadership has been steadily increasing
over the past five years, the EU and NATO have consulted on their
respective EDTs agendas only twice. Furthermore, bureaucratic procedures
and misalignments sometimes frustrate even staff-to-staff cooperation in
this area. The EU and increasingly NATO are proliferating agencies that
conduct work on innovation in EDTs, including in security and defense.
This makes it challenging to achieve internal coherence of activities
within one organization, let alone coordinating agendas between the
two.As the allies meet with the [EU High Representative for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell]{.underline} at this month's
NATO summit, the [two organizations need a more ambition agenda for
cooperation]{.underline}. In particular, the [EU and NATO need to
consider a joint task force on fostering defense innovation and EDTs,
with renewable two-year mandates. This instrument would provide
political impetus for closer cooperation on EDTs]{.underline}, it would
[give coherence, regularity, and structure to the efforts of the two
sides, and ensure commonality of purpose and synergy of
output]{.underline}. In addition, allies could [consider meeting
regularly in EU-NATO digital summit formats.]{.underline} The EU could
take the lead in this regard given its considerable financial capacity
for investing in EDTs and its regulatory powers. EU-NATO digital summits
would allow the transatlantic partners to regularly review progress,
provide strategic guidance on legal, ethical and adoption challenges
related to innovation and EDTs, and enhance their tech diplomacy by
inviting like-minded global partners to attend.

### DA -- focus uniqueness 

#### NATO is focused on China -- this is the newest card, assumes the recent summit

**Aljazeera 6-30**-22 (NATO declares China a security challenge for the
first time, Al Jazeera,
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/6/30/nato-names-china-a-strategic-priority-for-the-first-time,
6-30-22) -JV

**[[NATO has listed China as one of its strategic priorities]{.mark} for
the first time]{.underline}**, saying Beijing's ambitions and its
"coercive policies" challenge the Western bloc's "interests, security
and values". **[[The alliance's new blueprint]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or
Strategic Concept (PDF), that lays out its priorities for the next
decade, was approved at a leader's summit in Spain on Wednesday. The
document directed its harshest language towards Russia, which it
described as "the most significant and direct threat" to the alliance's
peace and security, but [[said Beijing's military ambitions]{.mark}, its
confrontational rhetoric towards Taiwan and its increasingly close ties
with Moscow [posed "systemic challenges]{.mark}". "China is
substantially building up its military forces, including nuclear
weapons, bullying its neighbours, threatening Taiwan ... monitoring and
controlling its own citizens through advanced technology, and spreading
Russian lies and disinformation," NATO's Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg told reporters. "China is not our adversary," he added, "but
we must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it
represents."]{.underline} In response, **[China on Thursday said it
"firmly" opposed NATO's declaration, calling it a "completely futile"
warning]{.underline}**. "NATO's so-called new strategic concept document
disregards facts, confuses black and white ... \[and\] smears China's
foreign policy," foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said**[. [The
official turn by NATO puts the world's largest military
alliance]{.mark}, based on the United States armed forces, [on guard
against China]{.mark}, which has the world's second-largest economy and
a rapidly growing military, both in numbers and in top-notch technology.
"One of the things that \[China's\] doing is seeking to undermine the
rules-based international order that we adhere to, that we believe in,
that we helped build," said US Secretary of State Antony
Blinken.]{.underline}** "And if China's challenging it in one way or
another, we will stand up to that." Western leaders are concerned that
Russia's aggression in Ukraine, which China is yet to condemn, could
embolden Beijing to be more assertive over Taiwan. China considers
Taiwan a part of its territory with no right to independent recognition
as a state or representation on the world stage. [**Speaking at an event
in Madrid** that was not part of the NATO summit, British Foreign
Secretary Liz Truss said that **unless China is checked "there is a real
risk that they draw the wrong idea which results in a catastrophic
miscalculation such as invading Taiwan,"**]{.underline} referring to the
self-governing island that China claims as a province. Marcin Jerzewski,
head of the Taiwan office of the European Values Center for Security
Policy, told Al Jazeera that NATO members may also be concerned about
Chinese-Russian military cooperation on Russia's oft-forgotten Pacific
coast. Before the war in Ukraine, Putin began pursuing his own "pivot to
the east" by ramping up economic development and his military presence
on the Pacific Coast. "This is an important step for NATO and in a way a
sign that NATO is waking up to a new geopolitical reality, which is
largely defined by the growing confluence of Russian and Chinese
strategic interests," Jerzewski said. "Russia has been viewed mainly as
a source of threats in the European theatre, but that view ignores
Russia's physical presence on the shores of the Pacific." Highlighting
NATO's new focus on China, the gathering of world leaders in Madrid,
both inside the bloc's summit and on its sidelines, included many from
Asian nations. It was the first time that the leaders of Japan, South
Korea, Australia and New Zealand were invited to a NATO summit. They
participated in a NATO session on new global challenges after holding a
side meeting outside of the summit. **[New Zealand's Prime Minister
Jacinda Ardern, speaking at the meeting, said China had become "more
assertive and more willing to challenge international rules and norms".
Ardern, whose government has toughened its tone recently on both
security and Beijing's growing presence in the South Pacific, in part
due to the signing of a security pact between China and the Solomon
Islands, said the resilience of the Indo-Pacific region must be
strengthened through relationships and economic architecture rather than
militarisation]{.underline}**. "We must stand firm on the rules-based
order, call for diplomatic engagement and speak out against human rights
abuses at all times when and where we see them," she said. Earlier on
Wednesday, Zhao, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, had accused
NATO of maintaining a "Cold War mentality". The alliance should give up
its "zero-sum game and the practice of creating enemies, and not try to
mess up Asia and the whole world after disrupting Europe", he said. Zhao
also criticised the sanctions brought against Russia by NATO members
over the Ukraine war, saying "facts have proven that sanctions are not a
way out of conflicts, and the continued delivery of weapons will not
help realise peace". China continues to claim it is neutral in the
Ukraine war, and has accused NATO and the US of provoking Russia into
military action. Weeks before Russia's February invasion, Chinese
President Xi Jinping hosted his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, for
a summit at which they pledged a partnership that had "no limits".

#### Biotech is not easy for NATO -- magnifies internal divisions and requires wholly new frameworks for coop

However, [NATO and the transatlantic allies are neither the only nor the
most agile actors investing [in **e**]{.mark}merging and
**[d]{.mark}**isruptive **[t]{.mark}**echnologies]{.underline}. China
and Russia already invest substantially in and have accelerated their
adoption of these technologies in military applications. To maintain its
strategic advantage against China and Russia, [[NATO needs to
become]{.underline}]{.mark} an agent of innovation and be **[[more
agile]{.underline}]{.mark}** and strategic in supporting allies to
jointly exploit new technologies for deterrence, defense, and resilience
purposes. [NATO has prioritized EDTs]{.underline} and signaled it has
joined "the technological adoption race" against China and Russia.1
**[[Much work remains to be done]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Allies remain
**divided** on the ethical and legal specifics]{.mark} of the military
use of EDTs [and]{.mark} by their [national-industrial
preferences]{.mark}. Technological [**capacity** across the

**[funding is in short supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Concrete decisions
on how to consolidate innovation in EDTs, a critical task for NATO's
mission and future adaptation, are expected at this month's Brussels
summit. Specifically, allies will respond to calls for a "strategic
surge" in EDTs2 innovation by establishing a Defense Innovation
Accelerator, an opt-in instrument funded through dedicated national
contributions, which NATO hopes will incentivize innovation and
transatlantic cooperation on emerging technologies.3

#### NATO is internally divided over biotech -- plan undermines cohesion

Technology Policy Centre, a Senior Fellow at the School of Foreign
Service - Georgetown University, and the Director-General of the Pacific
Islands Society, "NATO risks unity over emerging technologies divide,"

Disruptive innovations

At present, the world is witnessing an unprecedented period of
scientific and technological innovation being spurred on by the
synergistic combination of converging technologies, including
nanotechnology, [[biotechnology]{.underline}]{.mark}, robotics,
information technology, and cognitive science (NBRIC). Such convergence
[[is producing a wide range of disruptive
innovations]{.underline}]{.mark} that may contribute to a "tremendous
improvement in human abilities, societal outcomes, the nation's
productivity, and the quality of life". And, current WMD states clearly
do not possess a monopoly over such innovation.

Converging [[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[pose]{.underline}]{.mark} [fundamental human security
[challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Francis Fukuyama once argued in Our
Posthuman Future: Consequences of the Biotechnology Revolution,
converging technologies could inequitably transform the world we live in
and, in the process, undermine the very foundations that underpin
liberal democracies. Whether or not such a future unfolds, it is clear
that [[their application raises]{.mark} serious [ethical and moral
issues that are proving **divisive for allies**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
enemies alike (eg: the debates over armed drones and cyber espionage).
Even where common approaches can be achieved (eg: combatting designer
drugs), converging [[technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} are growing
"faster than our ability to legislate or regulate" them.

The search for consensus

These developments [[are putting]{.mark} new [**stresses** on]{.mark}
the [NATO]{.mark} alliance]{.underline}. According to a recent experts
workshop, the NBRIC Revolution is threatening NATO unity. "As warfare is
outsourced to only those who are 'near peers' in technology and societal
views shift," [[NATO will likely experience "decreasing political
tolerance]{.underline}]{.mark} for alliance security efforts". If NATO
member states want to sustain "the traditional transatlantic compact
\[European political support in return for US military guarantees\]",
they must change the way NATO approaches cooperative security around
emerging technologies. And, they need to do it now.

#### NATO lacks resources -- adopting new tech approaches overwhelms them

Max **Bergmann and** Siena **Cicarelli '21**, January 13, "NATO's
Financing Gap," AMERICAN PROGRESS,
https://www.americanprogress.org/article/natos-financing-gap/

Now, [[with]{.mark} the [COVID]{.mark}-19 crisis [hammering the balance
sheets of all NATO members, the prospect for European defense spending
looks **bleak**]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 [[It seems **unlikely** that
there will be significant new investment to address]{.mark} some of
[NATO's]{.mark} critical **[capability gaps]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Indeed, the European Union---which had planned to increase funding to
upgrade the dual-use infrastructure critical to moving NATO forces---has
reduced its planned allocations in its recent budget.6 [[NATO
members]{.mark} seeking to keep their economies alive [are **unlikely to
prioritize defense**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[This is a serious problem for the alliance, and NATO needs to think
more creatively about how to support continued alliance investment in
the wake of the massive economic contraction caused by COVID-19. [Simply
demanding that countries spend more]{.mark} on defense, which was not
very effective prepandemic, [will **certainly not work**]{.mark}
now]{.underline}.

What has become apparent is that NATO's default focus on individual
nation-state spending commitments was doing little to address
alliancewide issues. Collectively, European NATO members spend as much
on defense as Russia, yet the [disaggregated and loosely coordinated
spending by individual states means that the alliance's combat strength
is well short of what it could be and has left critical gaps in its
capabilities]{.underline}.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, since its founding, [[has **lacked the
resources** to fill gaps and make investments]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
alliance has overlooked one of its potentially most powerful
assets---the collective economic and financial clout of its members.
NATO has not leveraged its collective financial stature and the position
of its many wealthy members to shore up the alliance. In the wake of the
COVID-19 crisis, this must change through the creation of its own bank.
