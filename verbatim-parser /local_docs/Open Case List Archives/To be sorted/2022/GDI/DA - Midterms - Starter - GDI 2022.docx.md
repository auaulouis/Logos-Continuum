#### GOP is poised to win the midterms

Jason **[Lemon June 2]{.underline}**, 2022, "Republicans\' Chances of
Beating Democrats for Control of Senate in Midterms," NEWSWEEK,
<https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-chances-flipping-senate-democratic-control-midterms-1712378>

**[[Overall, polling shows Republicans are favored to perform well in
the midterms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A CNN/SSRS Opinion Panel carried
out from May 3 to 5 showed that **[[49 percent of registered voters said
they\'d vote]{.mark} for a generic [Republican]{.mark} candidate if the
election were held today. [Just 42 percent said they\'d cast ballots
for]{.mark} generic [Democratic
candidates]{.mark}]{.underline}**---giving the GOP a 7-point advantage.
Meanwhile, the Real Clear Politics average of recent generic
congressional ballot polls currently has the GOP in the lead by 1.9
percent.

Recent historical precedent also suggests that **[[one or both
congressional chambers are likely to flip to Republican
control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Last June, the University of Virginia\'s
Center for Politics released an analysis of midterms going back to 1946.
That report showed that the president\'s party has lost more than three
Senate seats, on average, during the midterms. The biggest loss has been
13 seats, while the largest gain has been just four seats.

#### NATO cooperation is a rally point for Dem voters in November

Post. He joined The Post in 1978 and has been involved in political
coverage as a reporter or editor throughout his career. Before coming to
The Post, he worked at National Journal magazine as a reporter and an

America's Political Landscape?" WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/19/sundaytake-ukraine-war-politics/

**[The war in [Ukraine]{.mark} has unsettled [American politics]{.mark}.
The degree to which [it is]{.mark} changing American politics is the
more [consequential]{.mark} question [for]{.mark} President [Biden and
the]{.mark} [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Russia's brutal and unprovoked aggression against its sovereign neighbor
has refocused the world. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has
become a figure of international acclaim and admiration. Russian
President Vladimir Putin has become an international pariah. **[[NATO
has been rejuvenated]{.mark} and the United States is once again leading
the Western alliance]{.underline}**.

**[How much does [that]{.mark} matter to American voters and how much
[will]{.mark} it [matter in]{.mark} the [November]{.mark} midterm
elections]{.underline}**? Today, inflation and other domestic issues
remain the main drivers of the upcoming elections. One change the war
has brought is that it has frozen the political environment at home and
placed some issues --- gas prices specifically --- into a
more-than-purely-domestic context.

We know from scatterings of recent history that at this stage of a
conflict like the one that continues to unfold in Ukraine, projections
months into the future are risky to foolhardy. Surprise is one certainty
of politics.

**[[Wars]{.mark} that directly involve U.S. forces often [produce a
rallying effect]{.mark} for the president]{.underline}**. When the
United States launched a war in early 1991 to eject Iraq from Kuwait,
President George H.W. Bush saw his approval ratings soar to close to 90
percent. Two years later, he had lost his bid for reelection and was out
of office.

After the United States responded strongly to the attacks on Sept. 11,
2001, President George W. Bush's approval ratings slightly eclipsed his
father's levels. Republican candidates rode his anti-terrorism message
to a successful midterm election the following year. Views about the war
in Iraq had not shifted enough to prevent Bush from winning reelection
in 2004, but by 2006, opposition to the war contributed heavily to the
Democrats' takeover of the House.

This war is different. **[[Biden has built and led an international
coalition]{.mark} that has slapped punitive sanctions on Russia and come
to the aid of Ukraine with continuous shipments of weapons and open
doors to now millions of refugees fleeing the destruction. He has called
Putin a war criminal but has resisted steps that he says could lead to a
wider war]{.underline}**. No U.S. troops have been committed, and Biden
has said that will not change. Still, Putin is unpredictable, and so,
too, could be the course of the conflict and possible ways it ends.

**[The war in [Ukraine]{.mark} has brought Americans closer together on
some things; call it the Putin effect. At a time of division at home,
Putin [has given Americans a]{.mark} common enemy and a sense of
[collective purpose]{.mark}. [Big majorities of]{.mark} Republicans and
of [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [believe that cooperation with U.S.
allies is the right posture]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[according to the
Pew Research Center]{.underline}**. A similar pattern emerges on the
decision to impose sanctions on Russia, with more than 8 in 10 in each
party supporting the continuation of those measures.

#### Biden's moves associated with Ukraine can reverse momentum in the midterms

David **[Lauter '22]{.underline}**, March 11, Senior Editor, "Essential
Politics: War in Ukraine scrambles GOP and Democratic strategies for
midterms," LOS ANGELES TIMES,
https://www.latimes.com/politics/newsletter/2022-03-11/politics-war-ukraine-scrambles-plans-2022-midterm-election-essential-politics

The domestic political impact of the war in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**
--- now in its third week --- **[has scrambled the two parties'
strategies going into this year's midterm elections]{.underline}**. Both
have started to maneuver for advantage.

No one knows whether either side will benefit **[[come November --- a
lot depends on how voters end up perceiving the war's
course]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

But **[[for]{.underline}]{.mark}** President **[[Biden and the
Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**, who have been tracking toward
a significant defeat, **[[attention to a foreign crisis could provide a
badly needed shakeup]{.mark} of the campaign debate]{.underline}**.

An overwhelming issue

"As a general rule, Americans don't vote on foreign policy unless
American men and women are dying in a war, but **[we've rarely had an
international event not involving the United States directly that has so
totally consumed our news and attention as the Russian invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Republican pollster and
strategist Whit Ayres.

"**[This war [has become symbolic]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the
survival of democratic regimes against authoritarian dictatorships,"
Ayres added. "**[That]{.underline}** symbolism **[has given it a much
broader meaning]{.underline}**."

A poll this week by Navigator Research, a Democratic firm, found that
37% of American voters said they were "very closely" following news from
Ukraine, and nearly 8 in 10 said they were following it at least
somewhat closely --- high numbers for a foreign issue.

**[National security and [foreign policy]{.mark} had [jumped to the top
of American concerns, tied with jobs and the economy, displacing]{.mark}
worries about the [corona]{.mark}virus [and
inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the poll found.

Amid that intense focus, **[Americans have clearly picked a side ---
overwhelmingly favoring the Ukrainians]{.underline}**. That could be
seen in Wednesday's House vote to suspend oil imports from Russia, which
passed 414-17 with just two of the chamber's most left-wing Democrats,
Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, and 15
right-wing Republicans voting no.

**[That level of attention makes the [Ukraine]{.mark} war the kind of
event that [could significantly shift U.S.
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"**[Politics isn't the most important thing right now]{.underline}**,"
said Democratic strategist Steve Schale, chief executive of the
pro-Biden super-pac Unite the Country.

But, he added, since 1992, "the only two midterm elections that were not
absolute debacles for the incumbent president's party were held during a
window where there was something significant in the country that
reshaped the conversation."

Those two were 1998, when voters rejected Republican efforts to impeach
President Clinton and Democrats gained four seats, and 2002, when
Republicans under President George W. Bush gained seats in the aftermath
of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.

Biden and the Democrats have a long way to go to emulate the midterm
successes those two presidents enjoyed. A new Wall Street Journal poll
released Friday continues to show Democrats trailing the GOP as the
party voters say they expect to back in November.

But polls have also shown an uptick in voters' assessments of how Biden
is doing his job. The change is just a few percentage points, but after
nine months of nearly steady decline, it's a welcome sign for the
president.

Ukraine has clearly contributed to the boost in Biden's ratings. A poll
by Morning Consult for Politico found this week, for example, that by
46% to 42%, voters approved of Biden's response to the crisis.

Voters' assessments of how Biden has dealt with Ukraine have improved
notably since last month and are also significantly higher than how they
assess his presidency overall.

**[[The shift comes primarily from]{.mark} [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s and
independents]{.mark}]{.underline}**; Republicans mostly remain highly
critical of Biden. The Navigator poll, however, did identify a slice of
Republicans, mostly moderately conservative men, who approve of Biden on
Ukraine even as they disapprove of his performance otherwise.

In any case, **[[winning back wavering partisans and independent voters
is a key task]{.mark} for Biden right now, one [that could be critical
in]{.mark} the small number of [swing]{.mark} House [districts]{.mark}
and Senate elections [in which the midterms will be most intensely
contested]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

If voters continue to approve of **[Biden's response]{.underline}**, it
**[could help]{.underline}** with one of his key problems --- the
perception by many Americans that he's not a strong leader.

#### GOP control allows Afghanistan reinvasion

Hunter **[Wallace September 8]{.underline}**, 2021, "Moving Forward,"
OCCIDENTAL DISSENT,
<http://occidentaldissent.com/2021/09/08/moving-forward-2/>

What does that mean though? **[[Assuming the GOP returns to power in
Congress]{.mark}, what will it do with that power]{.underline}**?
**[What can [we expect]{.mark} from having Mitch McConnell and Kevin
McCarthy in power again in Washington]{.underline}**? What will they do
about anything? It is also becoming increasingly clear that Donald Trump
intends to run again in 2024. Blumpf: Season Two will be **[[reinvading
Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}** to own the libs.

It has been sickening to watch these people for the last three weeks
because it has revealed that they have no intention of changing
anything. It will be back to corporate tax cuts and deregulation. **[[It
will be back to surges and troop deployments]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[and warmongering [to restore]{.mark} the "[credibility]{.mark}" of
the American Empire]{.underline}**. It will be back to "rebuilding our
military" which sees us as its "domestic enemy." They will carry water
for the "intelligence community" and shill for its agenda to own the
libs. Above all else, we will return to endless grifting and backlash
politics and giving these people power so that they can explain to us
that there is nothing that they can do about anything for deep
philosophical reasons like Gov. Kristi Noem.

#### Reinvasion checks China and Russia -- key to hegemony and international liberal order

Asim **[Kashgarian October 27]{.underline}**, 2021, "China, Russia
Working Together on Security Threats in Central Asia," VOA NEWS,
https://www.voanews.com/a/china-russia-working-together-on-security-threats-in-central-asia/6288233.html

**[[Beijing\'s and Moscow's security agendas are
complementary]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Cooley, **[and can be
mutually accommodated [because each views the region as key]{.mark} to
its own security, [and neither wishes for the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [to return]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"Russia is concerned about potential instability on Central Asian
borders, maintaining security cooperation with the Central Asian states
and curbing the influx of refugees into Eurasia," Cooley told VOA.
"China is primarily concerned with ensuring that the Taliban clamp down
on Uyghur groups residing near the border and securing the Afghan and
Tajik borders with Xinjiang."

Russia may not be happy, though, Cooley said, about China's recently
increased security footprint in Central Asia --- including the military
facility in Tajikistan, expanded military exercises with the Central
Asian states, surveillance technologies "transferred" to Central Asian
cities and increased activities by Chinese private security companies to
help protect Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure projects.

"But **[[the two]{.mark} countries [have every reason
to]{.mark}]{.underline}** reject talk of 'competition' and **[[emphasize
their joint opposition to U.S. hegemony and the U.S.-led liberal
international order]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Cooley underscored.

#### U.S.-led world order solves climate and avoid war -- existential risks

Hans-Georg **[Betz November 3]{.underline}**, 2021, "Uncertain Times in
a World Without American Hegemony," FAIR OBSERVER,
https://www.fairobserver.com/region/north_america/hans-georg-betz-international-order-great-powers-american-hegemony-china-news-12512/

Three decades later, the world is in disarray. The attacks of September
11 were a drastic reminder that not everybody was sold on Fukuyama's
utopia. The financial crisis that followed the collapse of Lehman
Brothers and, with it, the house of cards built on a derivatives market
that had spun out of control exposed the irrationality of rational
behavior --- taking more and more risks simply because everybody else
did so. Finally, COVID-19 has demonstrated how quickly **[[the]{.mark}
beautiful [world]{.mark}]{.underline}** of ever-expanding consumer
choices, sustained by cheap labor in remote parts of the world, **[[can
grind to a screeching halt]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Benign Hegemon

**[[It is too early to tell whether]{.mark} or not [global turbulences
have reached a point of no return]{.mark}. The prospects are not great,
and [that has a lot to do with the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. There is a strong sense that [America's hegemonic
position]{.mark}, which it assumed after World War II, [is on the wane
and, with it, the]{.mark} country's "commitment to promoting a [liberal
international order]{.mark}]{.underline}**." Or, perhaps, the United
States suffers from a severe case of "leadership fatigue" and no longer
wants to play the role of the "benign hegemon."

The notion of **[the benign hegemon]{.underline}** is derived from
hegemonic stability theory, popular among some experts in international
relations. The theory posits that order and stability in world affairs
crucially depend on a Great Power capable of sustaining them and willing
to do so. As Stephen Kobrin, of the Wharton School, has recently put it,
"A stable, open economy requires a hegemon, a dominant power who
**[can]{.underline}** provide some of the necessary public goods, absorb
costs, and **[order the system]{.underline}**."

Although this pertains particularly to international economic relations,
it can be applied to other areas, such as international security. Order
and stability require, among other things, that the hegemonic power
formulate and underwrite the rules that define and govern the
interactions between states in the international system. This was the
case in the second half of the 19th century when Great Britain assumed
this role, providing and guaranteeing global public goods such as free
trade, capital mobility and the British pound, backed up by the gold
standard, as the global reserve currency.

The system came to an end with World War I. The conflict left Britain
weakened and largely unable to reassume its prewar role. The interwar
period was characterized by turmoil and crises, paving the way for the
rise of autocratic regimes, committed to establishing a new order on the
ruins of the old one. They accomplished the latter, but the new order
was not theirs to create. The new hegemonic power that emerged from the
war was not Hitler's Germany but the United States, which filled the
void left by an exhausted Great Britain.

This was anything but a natural transition. In fact, for most of the
interwar period, the United States had refused to get entangled in
international affairs. America's retreat from internationalism after
World War I was epitomized by Congress's refusal to join the League of
Nations --- and that despite the fact that the league had been the
brainchild of US President Woodrow Wilson.

Isolationism went hand in hand with protectionism. Throughout the 19th
century and way into the beginning of the 20th, the United States
boasted some of the highest tariffs in the world. The culmination was
the infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which had a devastating
impact on international trade and contributed to the Great Depression.
It was not until the United States entered the war against Nazi Germany
that it assumed the role commensurate to its position as the
economically and militarily by far strongest power in the world.

Alternative Options

The failure of the most recent G20 meeting in Rome to arrive at a
meaningful common position on global warming and climate change ahead of
the COP26 in Glasgow is further proof that the United States is no
longer in a position to fill this role. Instead of leading, President
Joe Biden blamed China and Russia "for any disappointment over the level
of commitment by G20 leaders to fight climate change." This is not to
deny that Biden has a point. But **[[given the enormity of the impact
climate change is bound to have on]{.mark} the natural environment and
[life on this planet]{.mark}, [it is]{.mark} little more than [an
exercise in passing responsibility]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Biden's remark, however, does address a serious issue, namely the role
of China in a rapidly changing world. A few weeks ago, Chinese coal
production reached new historic highs, amounting to an estimated 4
billion tons for this year. Accelerated coal production is supposed to
alleviate energy shortages that have threatened to slow down the
country's growth. Unfortunately, emissions-wise, coal happens to be one
of the worst sources of energy.

A new study on the impact of carbon dioxide emissions on coastal areas
predicts catastrophic devastation as a result of rising sea levels for
some of the world's megacities, particularly in India, Indonesia,
Vietnam and China --- all major coal consumers. Given the concentration
of China's population in a string of coastal cities, one might assume
that it has a particular interest in combating climate change. In
theory, this would entail an active involvement in global governance, a
proposition that China has been more than reluctant to embrace,
presumably because it would entail directly challenging the United
States.

At the same time, however, China has launched major initiatives, such as
the foundation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and
particularly the One Belt, One Road initiative. Together with China's
massive engagement in Africa, these projects leave the impression that
they are part of a comprehensive drive designed to establish China as an
alternative to the United States.

This might herald the emergence of a new system, no longer dominated by
one power but multipolar, and certainly very different from the one
established after World War II. For, as Princeton's John Ikenberry has
noted a few years ago, "**[[there is no liberal internationalism without
American]{.mark} and western [hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- and
that age is ending." With the decline of the United States and the
parallel rise of China, countries have the option to "seek alternative
patrons rather than remain dependent on Western largess and support."

**[[The end result might very well be]{.mark} a bifurcated world order,
on the heels of a period of [instability and
turmoil]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or what Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini
have called a "G-Zero" world, one **[[without]{.mark} clear leadership
and [global cooperation]{.mark}. Bifurcation means the coexistence of
competing systems]{.underline}** that follow fundamentally different
rules. This can already be observed in the realm of economic governance.

Olga Petricevic and David Teece have recently warned of a "noticeable
defiance of the principles of classical economic liberalism and the
rule-of-law" by **[[Russia and China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Chinese
"alternative model of governance," they note, "is deploying coordinated
protectionist trade and investment policies and government intervention
aimed at accessing and acquiring foreign intellectual property, thereby
influencing the global economic and innovation system." Its success is
likely to **[[inspire]{.underline}]{.mark}** imitation and **[attempts
to jump on the bandwagon, resulting not only in [bifurcation]{.mark} but
in polarization [reminiscent of the Cold War]{.mark}
period]{.underline}**.

# UQ

### GOP YES

#### GOP will win over swing voters -- that tips the election in their favor

Alan **[Greenblatt May 27]{.underline}**, 2022, "You Don\'t Need to Be a
Fortune Teller: Signs Point to GOP Sweep This Year," GOVERNING,
<https://www.governing.com/now/you-dont-need-to-be-a-fortune-teller-signs-point-to-gop-sweep-this-year>

But culture war issues motivate the party's base. And, **[to appeal to
swing voters, Republicans have plenty of]{.underline}** other **[clubs
with which to beat Biden and the Democrats]{.underline}**. Maybe you've
already heard this, but **[inflation has jumped the most in four
decades]{.underline}**. **[Gas prices, already at a retail average of
\$4.60 per gallon, may well go higher with summer travel demand ---
perhaps as high as \$6. Homicides have increased dramatically since
2019, fueling a return to "tough on crime" rhetoric among
Republicans]{.underline}**.

**[It\'s all easy fodder for an opposition party to run on. Polls
indicate that voters trust the GOP more, by significant margins, when it
comes to inflation and the economy in general. Republicans are enjoying
their biggest advantage regarding the crime issue in
decades]{.underline}**.

All of this is reflected in how partisans are responding. The gap
between the numbers of Democrats and Republicans retiring from Congress
is the highest it's been in decades. At the legislative level,
Republicans are leaving fewer seats open than Democrats.

Republicans raised \$170 million from January to March through WinRed,
an online fundraising platform. That still lags the Democrats' ActBlue,
which has traditionally been much more robust, but represents nearly a
one-quarter jump for WinRed over the same period in 2020. The Republican
Governors Association raised \$33 million in the first quarter of the
year, which was nearly \$10 million more than the Democratic Governors
Association. The Republican State Leadership Committee brought in just
over \$10 million, compared with \$6.5 million for the Democratic
Legislative Campaign Committee.

Who Will Turn Out?

In the end, **[voter behavior matters]{.underline}** most of all. Again,
**[the GOP has a big advantage]{.underline}**.

**[A slew of polls have showed large and indeed growing gaps in terms of
levels of enthusiasm about voting this year between Republicans and
Democrats]{.underline}**. But we don't have to rely strictly on polls
any more. We're still relatively early in the primary season, but
**[Republicans are showing up in ways that Democrats are
not]{.underline}**.

In the first 10 states to hold primaries this year, Republicans received
61 percent of the total vote, according to an analysis by GOP pollster
John Couvillon. The party generating more enthusiasm in primaries has
fared quite well in the last few midterms. Democrats received 54 percent
of the primary vote in 2018 --- a solid midterm year for them --- while
Republicans got 55 percent in both 2010 and 2014, landslide years for
the party.

It's true that primary turnout isn't a perfect measure, since not all
races are equally competitive. On Tuesday, for example, Stacey Abrams
was unopposed for the Democratic nomination for governor of Georgia,
while GOP Gov. Brian Kemp faced a contentious, if ultimately easy,
contest against former Sen. David Perdue. Turnout on the GOP side
increased by a half-million votes, compared to the 2018 primary.

But **[looking at the total picture, it's clear more Republicans are
turning out. A lot more Republicans]{.underline}**. Overall Republican
primary turnout is up 32 percent, while **[Democratic turnout has
actually declined 3 percent]{.underline}**.

**[All this paints a pretty grim picture for Democrats. They're running
behind on the issues that concern voters most]{.underline}**. Their
leader is losing support among key constituencies. Their potential
candidates are less likely to run, while their voters are less likely to
turn out.

It's clear that **[Republicans will be stronger at the end of the year
than they are now]{.underline}**. It's not yet possible to say how much
stronger, but if anyone offers to bet you Democrats will retain power in
Congress, take their money. At the state level, GOP victories may not be
as momentous, but that's only because they already hold majorities among
governors, legislators and legislative chambers.

**[For Republicans, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas will
fall early this year, on Nov. 8]{.underline}**.

#### Dems are set to lose because of Biden

Alan **[Greenblatt May 27]{.underline}**, 2022, "You Don\'t Need to Be a
Fortune Teller: Signs Point to GOP Sweep This Year," GOVERNING,
<https://www.governing.com/now/you-dont-need-to-be-a-fortune-teller-signs-point-to-gop-sweep-this-year>

The main reason isn't hard to suss out. **[Every president can count on
his party losing seats in midterms, but President Biden's approval
ratings are particularly bad]{.underline}**. On average, **[41 percent
of Americans approve of the job he's doing]{.underline}**, compared with
54 percent who disapprove. "**[That is one of the lowest marks of any
president since World War II]{.underline}**," says Henry Olsen, a
conservative analyst at the Ethics and Public Policy Center. "**[Unless
that changes, I would expect a solid Democratic defeat]{.underline}**."

Granted, President Donald Trump's approval ratings were similarly
bargain basement in 2018 --- but then, Republicans lost control of the
House that year, along with seven governorships. The more important
comparison, at any rate, is not with Trump but with Biden himself. Biden
won the presidency in 2020 by 4.5 points. If he's down 13, that
represents **[a huge drop in support]{.underline}**, which **[seriously
imperils his party]{.underline}**.

**[Swing voters have swung hard against Biden. His net approval rating
among independents is roughly minus 20. That's a group he carried in
2020 by 13 points]{.underline}**, according to exit polls.

We've already witnessed a demonstration of how **[the president's
numbers can drag down other Democrats]{.underline}**. Last November,
Biden's net disapproval numbers were 12.5 percent points lower than his
victory margin in 2020. Guess what? The swing from Biden's share of the
vote to that won in 2020 by the Democratic candidates for governor was
12 points. Gov. Phil Murphy managed barely to hold on in New Jersey, but
Democrat Terry McAuliffe lost the governorship to Republican Glenn
Youngkin in Virginia --- a state Biden had carried a year earlier by 10
points.

Now, Biden's numbers are even lower than they were back in November.
This means any Democrat who won their last election by less than
double-digit margins should be nervous. That certainly includes
vulnerable governors such as Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Laura Kelly of
Kansas.

"**[The president's dismal ratings are what people care about the
most]{.underline}**," says GOP consultant David Carney. "**[It could be
a bloodbath]{.underline}** up and down the ballot, from the school board
to Congress.\"

#### Biden has lost the middle -- this undermines Dems' chances

Alan **[Greenblatt May 27]{.underline}**, 2022, "You Don\'t Need to Be a
Fortune Teller: Signs Point to GOP Sweep This Year," GOVERNING,
<https://www.governing.com/now/you-dont-need-to-be-a-fortune-teller-signs-point-to-gop-sweep-this-year>

Biden's old boss, Barack **[Obama, put together a winning coalition
during his presidency, combining college-educated whites with young,
Black and Latino voters. The danger for Democrats is that Biden appears
to be unraveling that coalition]{.underline}**. About the only groups
still solidly in his camp are dedicated members of the Democratic base,
such as Black voters and college-educated women.

Biden carried close to two-thirds of Hispanic voters in 2020, but their
shift toward Trump, compared to 2016, was notable, especially in states
such as Florida and Texas. In the Texas primaries in March this year,
participation in GOP primaries was up dramatically in heavily Hispanic
portions of South Texas that traditionally have been overwhelmingly
Democratic.

An NPR/Marist poll released last month found that 52 percent of Latinos
say they're more likely to support Republican candidates for Congress;
just 39 percent favor Democrats.

Young voters have been a particular problem for Biden. Voters under 30
favored Biden over Trump, 60 percent to 39 percent, in 2020, but they've
soured on him since. Biden's approval rating among young voters has
dropped by 18 points over the past year, according to a Harvard
Institute of Politics poll -- which is in line with what other pollsters
are finding.

Even as Democrats shed support among Latinos, young voters and parents,
the party's longstanding problem with working-class white voters
continues to worsen. The April NPR/Marist poll found Democrats are only
favored by a third of white voters without college degrees, compared to
55 percent who say they are likely to support Republicans.

"**[The people who are left backing Biden are the people who would back
any Democrat under anything except extreme
circumstances]{.underline}**," Olsen says. "**[That's a terrible place
to be in for an election. You've lost America's middle]{.underline}**."

#### GOP win is likely

the U.S. Midterms. Here's What that Means for the World," FOREIGN
POLICY,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/06/02/gop-congress-midterms-foreign-policy-ukraine-taiwan/

Was the Ukraine vote a harbinger of Republican national security
squabbles to come? Was it a partisan vote against anything associated
with President Joe Biden? Or was it a one-off reflecting a poorly
drafted bill with too much extraneous baggage? More importantly, **[who
will hold the]{.underline}** foreign-policy **[reins]{.underline}** in
the likely Republican House (and possibly Senate) majority to come in
2023---the isolationists or the internationalists?

Political **[pundits agree Republicans are likely to win back the House
of Representatives and have a good shot at the Senate in the November
2022 midterm elections]{.underline}**. That could---caucus
permitting---propel House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to the
speakership and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to the post of
majority leader. Of the two, McConnell is the known quantity---an
experienced legislator and parliamentarian and an old-school
internationalist whose foreign-policy views were forged in the crucible
of the Cold War. McCarthy, not so much. Indeed, it's probably most
accurate to say his foreign policy was forged in the crucible of former
President Donald Trump.

As previous Republican speakers have learned to their displeasure, the
Republican Party in today's House is less a caucus and more a raucous
battle for primacy. Former Speaker John Boehner struggled against
rebellious Tea Party upstarts, his successor Paul Ryan struggled against
the self-named Freedom Caucus, and McCarthy is unlikely to have much fun
either. In the minority, **[the Republican Party
tends]{.underline}**---emphasis intended---**[to stand
together]{.underline}** because the Democratic speaker and the executive
in the White House are deemed public enemies No. 1 and No. 2. But with
the majority comes the battle to control the agenda.

#### GOP is likely to take the midterms but Dems can still hold on

Andrew **[Prokop April 26]{.underline}**, 2022, "Why Republicans are
favored to win the Senate --- and how Democrats could stop them," VOX,
https://www.vox.com/23030164/senate-2022-midterm-elections-battlegrounds

**[Democrats' control of the 50-50 Senate could well be washed away by a
red wave in this fall's midterm elections]{.underline}**.

Republicans appear favored to win back the Senate for two simple
reasons. First, the national environment has moved in their favor.
Biden's approval rating is low. The GOP has improved in generic ballot
polls and won the governor's seat in Virginia last November.

Second, the Senate is already split 50-50, so a net gain of even just
one seat for Republicans would flip the chamber into their hands.

**[However, Democrats do still have a way to hold on]{.underline}**. The
main thing they have going for them is a decent map --- they aren't
defending any seats in states Trump won in 2020, while Republicans are
defending two states Biden narrowly won. **[If Democrats manage to hold
their losses to a minimum, or make up for them by defeating Republicans
elsewhere, they could keep Senate control. But if the national
environment keeps looking so dire for the party and the president, that
would be a tall order]{.underline}**.

### A2 GOP momentum overwhelms the link

#### GOP could still blow it

Douglas **[MacKinnon April 23]{.underline}**, 2022, a political and
communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for
Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and former special
assistant for policy and communications at the Pentagon during the last
three years of the Bush administration, "Republicans are more than
capable of blowing the 2022 midterms," THE HILL,
https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3276053-republicans-are-more-than-capable-of-blowing-the-2022-midterms/

**[If you don't believe the [Republicans can blow]{.mark} their chances
of winning majorities in [the]{.mark} House and Senate [midterms]{.mark}
this year, then you have not paid attention to the past five years of
U.S. politics]{.underline}**.

**[At least three [factors could reverse]{.mark} the predicted [fortune
for the GOP]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The first would be voter apathy by
traditional Republicans, conservatives and people of faith. The second
would be --- drum roll, please --- potential fallout from anything
Donald Trump says, does or hints. And the third would be **[[a
full-court press by]{.mark} [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark}, aided by some
in the mainstream media, to come across as suddenly
moderate]{.underline}** while metaphorically throwing Joe Biden and
Kamala Harris as far overboard as possible.

All three factors **[[will happen to some extent]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[[The question is]{.mark}, will some combination of them be [enough to
hold the]{.mark} Democratic [majority]{.mark} in Congress after
November]{.underline}**?

Apparently Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's (R-Ky.) main
strategy for winning is to avoid mentioning anything that Republicans
would do if they regained majority control.

The quote sometimes attributed to Napoleon --- "Never interfere with an
enemy while he's in the process of destroying himself" --- makes sense
if one believes the Democrats are failing across the board, but many
Republican voters who have been burned before by the GOP leadership
still want to hear a plan.

Polls indicate a red wave in November. Maybe so, but what if a
substantial number of Republican voters adopt the unyielding position of
"Fool me 10 times, shame on you. Try to fool me again and I'm not going
to vote."

Impossible? Trump's election to the White House in 2016 should remind us
all to expect the unexpected. McConnell and other entrenched elites of
the Republican Party may think the party's more traditional voting bloc
will never desert them, but they rarely walk in the shoes of
working-class Republicans who, like everyone else, are feeling the
brutal effects of the pandemic topped by skyrocketing inflation.

Just like the entrenched Democratic Party elites, these Republicans live
in a bubble of favors, luxury, security, wealth and gold-plated health
care plans. They're used to extravagant fundraisers, five-star resorts
and the vacation homes of billionaire donors.

As the election draws nearer, we can assume that many of these voters
who have been taken for granted by party leaders will have reached their
saturation point regarding empty promises. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who
chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), spoke
directly to the frustration of conservative voters when he released his
"11-Point Plan to Rescue America."

Some believe the plan needed more editing and was released too soon, but
its "rally around conservative principles" theme, much of it echoed by
Trump, managed to elicit the wrath of McConnell and the small army of
consultants who are loyal to him. In response to that noise, NRSC
communications director and Scott campaign aide Chris Hartline said: "We
don't spend much time worrying about criticisms from anonymous
Republican consultants who lost the Senate last cycle and who have
gotten rich off maintaining the status quo."

Indeed, the "McConnell wing" of the GOP might be shocked by how many
"traditional" voters stay home in November if they don't start seeing
conservative planks actually nailed into the foundation of the party.

Next, regarding Trump, as Republicans have witnessed the past few years:
"The Don giveth, but the Don also taketh away --- big time." Will
Trump's cult of personality bring more Republicans and independents into
the voting booth, or will it drive them away (as he did in the 2020
Georgia runoff election and Arizona's general election by bashing
Georgia Republicans, the voting process and the memory of the late John
McCain)?

And then we come to what the Democrats can do to try to salvage victory.
Some candidates, of course, will try to put as much distance as possible
between them and the Biden administration's failing policies. Biden is
flirting with the lowest approval ratings in history, and some see
Harris as more out of touch with each passing day.

If calling out Biden and Harris, or making fun of them --- as we saw
with the viral video in which Biden turned to shake hands with an
invisible person and with "Saturday Night Live" mocking Harris --- can
save the Democrats' majority in Congress, you can bet that more liberal
pundits and others will be willing to do so as the midterms approach.

#### GOP is highly favored but it's not a sure thing

Jordain **[Carney April 12]{.underline}**, 2022, "McConnell: 'Actually
possible' for GOP to screw up midterms with 'unacceptable' candidates,"
THE HILL,
<https://thehill.com/news/senate/3265655-mcconnell-actually-possible-for-gop-to-screw-up-midterms-with-unacceptable-candidates/>

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Tuesday said **[the
political atmosphere is good for Republicans heading into the midterms
but]{.underline}** warned that **[the party could bungle its
chances]{.underline}** if "unacceptable" candidates win their primaries
but go on to lose in November.

Republicans are feeling optimistic about their chances to win back the
Senate, but they face several messy primaries that could have
ramifications for the general election map and the GOP's chances of
picking up, or holding on to, a seat.

McConnell, speaking at a chamber event in Kentucky, said that 1994 had
been the best year for Republicans and that the atmosphere heading into
November "is better than it was in 1994."

"From an atmospheric point of view, **[it's a perfect storm of problems
for the Democrats]{.underline}**," McConnell said. "**[How could you
screw this up? It's actually possible]{.underline}**. And we've had some
experience with that in the past."

"In the Senate, if you look at where we have to compete in order to get
into a majority, there are places that are competitive in the general
election. So you can't nominate somebody who's just sort of unacceptable
to a broader group of people and win. We had that experience in 2010 and
2012," McConnell added.

To win back the Senate in November, Republicans would need a net pickup
of just one seat to tip the current 50-50 balance. Republicans are
defending 21 seats, compared to Democrats' 14, including two seats
currently held by Republicans that are in states President Biden won in
2020.

Five seats are rated by The Cook Political Report as toss-ups. Three of
those --- Nevada, Georgia and Arizona --- are currently held by
Democrats, while two --- Pennsylvania and Wisconsin --- are currently
held by Republicans. In Pennsylvania, GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring.

Meanwhile, three of the seats currently held by Republicans are ranked
as "lean" Republican: Florida, Ohio and North Carolina. In Florida, GOP
Sen. Marco Rubio is running for reelection, while Ohio and North
Carolina are open races because GOP Sens. Rob Portman and Richard Burr
are retiring.

Only one seat currently held by Democrats is ranked "lean" Democrat: New
Hampshire, where Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan is running for
reelection.

Despite having to play defense on a larger swath of seats,
**[Republicans are increasingly confident about their chances of winning
back the majority in November as Biden struggles to
rebound]{.underline}** in polling and Americans remain concerned about
inflation and the economy more broadly.

**[But]{.underline}** first **[Republicans need to
navigate]{.underline}** several crowded primaries that will determine
who their nominee is in **[the]{.underline}** general
**[election]{.underline}**.

### A2 Too soon

#### Dems will likely lose but the election is not "called" -- things can always change

Henry **[Olsen June 1]{.underline}**, 2022, senior fellow at the Ethics
and Public Policy Center, "The GOP midterm wave is set --- and Democrats
can't do anything about it" WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/01/gop-midterm-wave-is-set-democrats-cant-do-anything-about-it/

**[It's perfectly understandable why election analysts tend to be
cautious, even if they suspect the election cycle is developing in a
particular direction. [There's always a chance something will
intervene]{.mark}, and individual [races]{.mark} do [matter]{.mark}.
Even in wave years, some [candidates outperform]{.mark} the partisan
[fundamentals or get lucky]{.mark} and face an extremely weak
challenger]{.underline}**. That happened in a few high-profile Senate
races in the 2010, when Republican candidates Sharron Angle in Nevada
and Christine O'Donnell in Delaware both lost winnable races because
they were so outside the mainstream (O'Donnell had to cut an ad
clarifying that she wasn't "a witch" after clips surfaced of her saying
she had "dabbled in witchcraft"). **[[No serious analyst wants to call a
race]{.mark} before all the facts are in]{.underline}**.

**[[But that doesn't mean we can't make general
projections]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Presidents rarely improve their
approval ratings in the run-up to a midterm vote, and people who
disapprove of how a president is doing the job usually decide to give
the other party a shot. Some vulnerable incumbents will stand against
the tide, but the massive swell will also surprise a few people thought
to be safe. The result is that the odds are heavily in favor of analysts
rapidly revising their projections in Republicans' favor as campaigns
gain traction in the fall.

All this means **[[Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s will be thankful if they lose only
20 to 35 House seats this fall]{.mark}. They know they could lose as
many as 40 or even 50 seats, propelling Republicans to their greatest
House majority since 1928]{.underline}**. The GOP, meanwhile, knows they
can make history if they keep their heads down, nominate sane candidates
and keep the focus on President Biden.

#### It's not too soon -- momentum matters and it starts early

Henry **[Olsen June 1]{.underline}**, 2022, senior fellow at the Ethics
and Public Policy Center, "The GOP midterm wave is set --- and Democrats
can't do anything about it" WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/06/01/gop-midterm-wave-is-set-democrats-cant-do-anything-about-it/

Political analysts characterize elections where one party makes outsize
gains as "waves." The metaphor is apt: **[Political currents develop
well before elections. They gather strength as the big day approaches
and then crash ashore with great power, destroying whatever vulnerable
seats the opposing party holds in its wake]{.underline}**.

**[The key to understanding these waves is the knowledge that once they
are underway, there's nothing the other side can do to stop it until
voter anger renders its verdict. The only question is how high the wave
will become and how far "inland" it will go --- that is, how many seats
and members previously thought impervious to challenge will be swept out
to a watery political grave]{.underline}**.

### A2 Abortion

#### Abortion isn't enough to swing the election in favor of the Dems

Alan **[Greenblatt May 27]{.underline}**, 2022, "You Don\'t Need to Be a
Fortune Teller: Signs Point to GOP Sweep This Year," GOVERNING,
<https://www.governing.com/now/you-dont-need-to-be-a-fortune-teller-signs-point-to-gop-sweep-this-year>

"There are two big things that we don't know yet how they will play: The
first one is the Jan. 6 committee and its hearings, and the second one
is this abortion decision," says Lara Brown, a political scientist at
George Washington University. "Depending on how those capture the
attention of the country and different demographics, I do think that can
impact the magnitude of what ever wave the Republicans are looking at."

But in the weeks **[since]{.underline}** Justice Samuel **[Alito's
majority opinion on abortion law was leaked, there's been no evidence of
a surge in Democratic participation in primaries or early voting. Not
even any real uptick]{.underline}**.

"I'd be surprised if **[Roe v. Wade]{.underline}** did not energize the
marginal Democratic voter, the sort that would usually vote in the
presidential race but not necessarily in the midterm, but that **[only
gets you so far]{.underline}**," Olsen says. "**[The real game is the
swing voter]{.underline}**."

### Link -- NATO rally point

#### Ukraine opened a window for Biden and the Dems -- invigorating alliances like NATO resonates with voters as a key issue

Lauren **[Gambino March 15]{.underline}**, 2022, "Will Biden's handling
of the Ukraine crisis prove popular with US voters?" THE GUARDIAN,
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/joe-biden-russia-ukraine-democrats-midterms

Now **[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has given Biden a second chance to
demonstrate the steady leadership he promised, raising hopes among
Democrats that the White House's efforts]{.underline}** to punish Moscow
for its shocking aggression **[will resonate with voters in this year's
midterm elections]{.underline}**.

But Democrats face stiff headwinds in their attempt to defy historical
trends and maintain their narrow majorities in Congress. Among their
biggest obstacles are Biden's deep unpopularity and the rising cost of
gas, food and rent, for which Republicans have faulted Democrats.

At the Democrats' annual retreat in Philadelphia last week, party
leaders spoke of a world -- and an electorate -- reshaped by **[Russia's
invasion]{.underline}** of its democratic neighbor. They said the
conflict **[provided a new clarity of purpose]{.underline}** -- and a
new villain: Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

As the war in Ukraine threatens to push already rising gas prices even
higher, Democrats are blaming "Putin's tax hike". At the same time, they
are touting the administration's role coordinating a worldwide response
to Russia, and the devastating impact of economic sanctions,
highlighting a contrast with former president Donald Trump, who has
continued to praise Putin.

"That economic bomb that went off inside that dictator's regime would
not have been possible without Joe Biden's leadership," New York
congressman Sean Patrick Maloney, the chair of House Democrats' election
campaign arm, said in Philadelphia.

This strategy comes with considerable risk. Foreign policy is rarely
front of mind for voters. The situation remains volatile and
unpredictable. And Republicans are arguing that inflation was on the
rise long before Putin ordered his troops into Ukraine.

In a recent op-ed for CNBC, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy blamed
the administration's energy policy for exacerbating the current crisis.

"Unfortunately, the Democrats' wayward leadership for the past year has
undermined America's energy potential with senseless policies that seem
designed to reverse decades of success and wreak havoc on our gas
prices," he wrote.

Yet **[Democrats see some reasons to be hopeful. Recent surveys have
shown an uptick in support for Biden, buoyed by approval of his handling
of the conflict in Ukraine]{.underline}**, though his overall ratings
are still mired in the low 40s.

Americans broadly say they support the administration's response to the
conflict, which includes efforts to cripple Russia's economy and aid
Ukraine. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, Americans overwhelmingly
favor a ban on oil and gas purchases from Russia, even if it means
paying more at the pump. Among those respondents, a quarter said they
would be willing, at least in theory, to pay as much as it takes to
support Ukraine, while 32% said they would be willing to pay between \$1
and \$2 more per gallon and 11% said they would be willing to pay more
than \$2 more.

Whether voters blame Putin or Democrats for the rising cost of their gas
may yet be a central question of the midterm election.

"Democrats didn't cause this problem," Biden told Democrats in
Philadelphia. "Vladimir Putin did."

For American voters, foreign policy is often an issue that "doesn't
matter until it does," said Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, a Washington-based thinktank.

He said matters of war and peace have "represented two opposite turning
points" in Biden's presidency. While Afghanistan hurt his image as a
statesman who could rebuild America's credibility with allies after four
turbulent years of Trump, Galston said the war in Europe has given the
US president another chance to prove himself.

"We've been through about three decades -- the post cold-war era, which
has now ended, thunderously -- when foreign policy didn't matter so
much," he said. "But now it does, and I expect that it will continue to,
because now we face severe challenges on our western front in Europe and
our eastern front in the Indo-Pacific."

He added that the conflict "has played to the strengths of president
Biden and his foreign policy team: they are all deeply transatlantic in
their history and their commitments."

As a senator and vice-president, **[Biden worked to
strengthen]{.underline}** the **[alliances]{.underline}** forged in the
aftermath of the second world war. Now as president, he sought **[to
unite democracies around the world against the threat of rising
autocracies]{.underline}**, an effort complicated by the January 6
insurrection at the Capitol and the widespread belief among Republican
voters that the 2020 election was stolen.

In recent weeks, **[Biden has rallied world leaders, tapping his deep
foreign policy experience to reinvigorate]{.underline}** old
**[alliances]{.underline}** that his predecessor had disparaged and
nearly abandoned.

"I've spent literally hours and hours and hours and hours keeping the
alliance together -- the EU, Nato, and all of our allies, including our
Asian allies," he told Democrats in Philadelphia. "As a result, we've
been able to ramp up our economic pressure on Putin and further isolate
Russia on the global stage."

Inflation has weighed down Biden's approval rating, as Republicans blame
government spending and Democrats' energy policies for the rising cost
of gasoline. Research suggests that rising gas prices drives consumer
pessimism, an effect that is particularly noticeable among Americans who
lived through the 1970s oil crisis.

Guy Cecil, chairman of the Democratic political action committee
Priorities USA, told reporters during a briefing last week that Biden's
handling of the war "was reminding people why they voted for Joe Biden
to begin with and, frankly, why they opposed Donald Trump".

Although much of the Democrats' 2022 messaging will be focused on the
party's economic agenda and legislative accomplishments, Cecil said the
war in **[Russia provides a stark contrast between the president and
Trump]{.underline}**, who has forced some in his party to walk a
tightrope as they aim to condemn Putin without crossing the former
president. Priorities USA recently released a dark new ad that
highlights Trump's repeated praise of Putin and accuses Republicans of
aligning with a "murderous dictator".

"Donald Trump continues to say he wants to be a player in politics; he's
endorsing primary candidates around the country," Cecil said. "He's
raising money for candidates at Mar-a-Lago. He's doing campaign events,
and I think every candidate should be held accountable for Trump's
position."

In Philadelphia, Democrats expressed confidence that **[Biden's
leadership]{.underline}** in recent weeks **[would shake
the]{.underline}** long **[shadow cast by]{.underline}** the
administration's **[exit from Afghanistan]{.underline}**.

"I'm not surprised that **[his numbers have already bounced back
up]{.underline}**, and I think you're going to see that the worst is
behind us, and **[the next chapter is going to be where the American
people rediscover they elected a strong, decent man, who is fighting for
very important things]{.underline}**," Maloney said. "**[And it's the
Democrats that are doing that with him against Republican
opposition]{.underline}**."

### Link -- Ukraine pivot

#### Biden's multilateral response to Russia is a unique instance where foreign policy can flip the midterms

**['22]{.underline}**, February 28, "Russia invasion of Ukraine could
play unusual role in midterms," THE HILL,
<https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/595941-russia-invasion-of-ukraine-could-play-unusual-role-in-midterms/>

**[Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine could throw a wrench into the
midterms as voters scrutinize President Biden's efforts to counter
aggression from a global superpower and U.S. adversary]{.underline}**.

**[Foreign policy rarely touches down-ballot elections. But Russia's
moves in Europe, and the U.S.'s response, could have domestic
implications that hit Americans' pocketbooks and would come on top of
already high gas prices and record inflation --- issues voters rank
among the most important]{.underline}**.

Additionally, deep networks of immigrants from Eastern Europe reside in
some of the nation's most critical battleground states, and the
president's approval rating, a predictor of his party's midterm
performance, remains low.

"**[This is going to be a backdrop to a lot of the
elections]{.underline}** now," said Dave Pepper, the former chair of the
state Democratic Party in Ohio, a key swing state with the country's
fifth-highest population of Ukrainian residents.

Some Democrats believe Biden is well-positioned to explain his decisions
on Ukraine and defend the increasingly severe sanctions he is levying
against Moscow. The president this week called Russia's invasion a
"brutal assault on the people of Ukraine" and a "premeditated attack."
He placed new economic and technology sanctions on the country on
Thursday, and officials said they still have options on the table.

Pepper speculated that **[Biden's posture on the crisis --- and the
isolationist response from some GOP candidates --- could create an
opening for down-ballot Democrats in November's
elections]{.underline}**.

Ohio Republican Senate candidates Josh Mandel and J.D. Vance have
questioned why the U.S. is focused on the foreign conflict while
domestic issues mount. Vance went as far to say on a right-wing podcast
that he doesn't "really care what happens to Ukraine one way or
another," before walking back the statement.

Other Ohio GOP contenders, including Jane Timken, Mike Gibbons and Matt
Dolan, have called for economic retaliation against Russia. All the
candidates have condemned Biden's handling of the situation.

"I wasn't really thinking about the race in this way, but all of a
sudden my own heritage is relevant in how I vote," Pepper said,
referring to how Midwest residents who have a connection to Eastern
Europe may perceive the crisis.

He added, "It does add a wrinkle."

Biden and aligned Democrats are desperate to avoid a repeat of the
chaotic U.S. pullout from Afghanistan last year, for which the president
still receives criticism --- and which Republicans have claimed gave
Russian President Vladimir Putin the green light to move on Ukraine.

While Democrats denounce the conservatives aligned with former President
Trump, who praised Putin during his term in office and in statements
last week, many are fretting about how **[the geopolitical realities of
the invasion could hit working populations in the U.S. over the next
eight months]{.underline}**.

Recent polling shows Americans' faith in Biden's ability to handle the
situation is low. A Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll survey obtained by The Hill
on Friday found 37 percent of Americans said they were confident in the
administration's ability to effectively counter Russia, while 63 percent
said they were not confident. The same poll found Biden's approval
rating at a record low 38 percent.

"Voters believe the Biden administration can and should do more to
protect Ukraine," said Dritan Nesho, co-director of the poll. "They see
the sanctions so far as too weak and ultimately ineffective, and a
majority say the United States should defend Ukraine in case of a full
Russian invasion --- including a majority of Democrats. A stronger
posture appears to be both the right policy and good politics for the
administration."

Biden and Democrats may need to balance voters' desire to push back on
Russia and the domestic consequences of doing so.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to make gas prices surge in the
West, with the United States expected to take a major hit. While Biden
suggested on Thursday that the U.S. may release oil from its strategic
reserve in an effort to offset the rising cost at the pump, Democrats
acknowledge the president's limited reach and are preparing accordingly.

"In the short term, partially if gas prices shoot up and the stock
market becomes volatile, you're going to see numbers looking a little
worse for Democrats simply because it's a political market reaction to
these indicators," said Ivan Zapien, a lobbyist and former Democratic
National Committee official.

Biden entered the White House last year with no illusions about getting
on solid footing with Putin, whom prior administrations beyond Trump
have tried to appease. As former President Obama's No. 2, Biden's global
policy docket included Russia, which some believe helped prepare him to
delicately navigate what has been a brutal and bloody several days.

**[If history is any indication, there's room for Biden to advance his
public perception in a time of crisis]{.underline}**. But that comes
with complications.

"Foreign affairs, when it's removed and it's happening someplace else,
traditionally, historically has not had a huge impact on midterm races,"
said Chris Stirewalt, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute.

In a new piece for The Dispatch, Stirewalt outlines a number of notable
exceptions.

While the 1974 elections took place in the wake of the Watergate
scandal, the Yom Kippur War, which led to an oil embargo from the
Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, sent gas prices
through the roof when Americans were already plagued with high
inflation. Democrats won four seats in the Senate and 49 seats in the
House.

He also argues that Democrats suffered losses in '94 partly as a result
of a U.S. humanitarian mission in Somalia, which was considered a major
miscalculation under then-President Clinton.

"These things can penetrate, but they have to function at a very large
scale," Stirewalt said. "What has happened in Ukraine has already
penetrated."

Democrats argue that **[the U.S. response to the Russian invasion of
Ukraine gives Biden an opportunity to lead on foreign
policy]{.underline}**.

Supreme Court action to overturn Roe v. Wade should help energize
Democrats. Sixty-six percent of Democrats said it would make them more
likely to vote this fall, versus 40 percent of Republicans.

And a group of 17 Senate Democrats led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman
of the Senate Rules Committee, and Sen. Jack Reed, chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, wrote to senior defense and
intelligence officials setting out their concerns that **[Russia\'s
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}** only **[makes a disinformation
campaign more likely]{.underline}**.

\'As the Russian **[invasion]{.underline}** of Ukraine **[has led to an
increase in Russian]{.underline}** disinformation and warnings of
potential **[cyberattacks]{.underline}**, we urge you to ensure that
your agencies are prepared to quickly and effectively counter Russian
influence campaigns targeting the 2022 elections...\' they write.

**[\'Experts have warned that the increase in Russian disinformation and
cyber threats creates a security concern for U.S. elections and that
Russia will likely view the 2022 elections as a \"ripe target\" for
influence operations]{.underline}**.\'

The letter was sent to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro
Mayorkas, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, Director of National
Intelligence Avril Haines, Director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation Christopher Wray, and Director of the National Security
Agency and Commander of U.S. Cyber Command General Paul Nakasone.

The Russian operation in 2016 included hacking into the Clinton campaign
and Democratic National Committee servers, before leaking embarrassing
emails, according to the indictments.

Hackers also tried to compromise state election systems, including voter
registration databases, while troll farms spewed out fake news.

An investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee concluded that
Russia ran a massive campaign to try to tip the scales in Donald
Trump\'s favor and that it was carried out under the express orders of
President Vladimir Putin.

But claims that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian effort were
never substantiated and he and his allies have accused intelligence
agencies and investigators of running a witch hunt.

On Thursday, his allies quickly cried foul at the fresh warning.

His son, Donald Trump Jr, said on Twitter: \'Here we go again folks.\'

Mike Shields, former chief of staff for the Republican National
Committee, suggested interference was only a worry when Democrats lost.

\'2016 - rigged. 2020 - not rigged. how dare you say elections are
rigged,\' he tweeted. \'2022 - we\'re going to lose. rigged.\'

**[With]{.underline}** President Joe **[Biden mired in
crisis]{.underline}**, and with his ratings well underwater, **[his
party]{.underline}** is expected to lose control of the House and
possibly the Senate too.

In their letter, the senators praised the way the administration had
worked to reveal Russian covert actions and influence operations around
its war in Ukraine.

And said they **[hoped for action to counter midterm
interference]{.underline}**.

\'Our democracy has been a shining beacon for the world and as we
continue to assist Ukraine and our European allies, we must also be
vigilant in guarding against threats to our own system of government,\'
they wrote.

**[\'With primaries underway for the 2022 midterm election cycle and
ongoing preparations for the November general election, it is vital that
the federal government does everything in its power to ensure the
integrity of our elections against foreign threats]{.underline}**.\'

### Internal link -- Biden boosts the party

#### Credit for Biden spills over to Dems in the midterms

18]{.underline}**, 2022. Harvard Staff Writer. Former executive
Washington editor of The Wall Street Journal, author of its "Capital
Journal" column, and part of the reporting staff that won a Pulitzer
Prize for its coverage of 9/11. "Will rare U.S. unity on Ukraine lift
Democrats?" THE HARVARD GAZETTE,
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/05/will-rare-u-s-unity-on-ukraine-lift-democrats/

I think it has two paths by which **[[it could affect the midterm
elections]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The first is **[[if people conclude
that]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark} administration [has handled this
well]{.mark}, I think [that will]{.mark} offset some of the negative
impact of the messy withdrawal from Afghanistan and [work to the
Dem]{.mark}ocrats[' benefit]{.mark} generally]{.underline}**. Maybe not
in a huge way, but at least at the margins. And second, of course, if
something goes terribly wrong between now and Election Day, the whole
equation could change.

GAZETTE: "Terribly wrong" in what way?

SEIB: A huge escalation, for example, a crossing of the red line by
Russia into use of chemical weapons or, God forbid, a tactical nuclear
weapon --- then all bets are off. It's impossible to know what happens
then, and it's impossible to know what the political impact is at that
point. Conversely, if there's a complete Russian collapse and somehow
Vladimir Putin is pushed out, that's a pretty dramatic change, and you'd
have to reassess the political impact.

GAZETTE: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell both visited President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv in the last
two weeks pledging the unqualified support of the U.S. How are the
parties looking at Ukraine in terms of its strategic political value?

SEIB: I'm not sure they're looking at it in raw political terms right
now. I think this is one of those rare occasions in which people are
actually trying to figure out what is the right thing to do. It's
unfortunate that it appears there were partisan rather than bipartisan
voyages to Ukraine, pilgrimages to see President Zelensky. That was an
opportunity missed, an unfortunate case in which the actual bipartisan
spirit that prevails on Ukraine right now was not really demonstrated
appropriately. It would have been nice if it were otherwise. On both
sides, I think what party leaders are trying to do is to use this to
underscore that they are not leading parties that are in favor of a
wholesale American retreat from the international scene. And that was
somewhat in question with the rise of isolationist sentiment in both
parties over the last few years.

GAZETTE: As we get closer to Election Day, do you see the Republican
Party dropping its support for Ukraine if it appears that Democrats and
Biden are benefiting too much?

SEIB: It's possible, but I think the lines have been drawn and hardened
already, so I don't think that's likely. Since Reagan's time in the
early 1980s, there was a very strong international streak in the
Republican Party. Ronald Reagan was an internationalist, not an
isolationist, and he believed in America as a force for good in the
world. That was the prevailing strain of thought inside the Republican
Party and what we've seen here is it's still the prevailing strain of
thought inside the Republican Party. I think the more conventional
leaders of the party, the non-Trump leaders of the party, like Mitch
McConnell, are happy to see this whole Ukraine episode as proof that
their view of America as an active international player is, in fact, the
majority opinion within their party, and they're just going to leave it
at that.

GAZETTE: Knowing how important Trump's endorsement is for many
Republican candidates and his history of insisting on fealty as the
price for that support, do you expect he will turn his own views on
Ukraine and Putin into a loyalty test?

SEIB: That's a really good question, and I don't know the answer to
that. In a way, it's an awkward situation for Donald Trump because he
was friendly with Vladimir Putin. He basically preached that the U.S.
was over-engaged, overextended in the world, and that America First
meant exactly that --- America first --- and that there ought to be a
retreat on some fronts. Now you have a situation in which Americans seem
to want the U.S. involved --- to stop the Russians, to stop Vladimir
Putin personally, and to show that we remain a force for democracy and
against autocracy in the world. How does Donald Trump play that over
time? I don't think I know the answer. It's interesting that he has
chosen not to make a big issue of this. As I suggested, this is an
awkward situation.

GAZETTE: **[Biden's overall favorability with voters took a big hit with
the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan last August. [Since Russia's
invasion]{.mark}, he has recovered a bit, but is still viewed more
unfavorably than favorably by all voters. Among independents, however,
[Biden is up]{.mark} by 30 points since the war began. [How significant
are these shifts, particularly among]{.mark} independent [voters]{.mark}
who were decisive for Biden in 2020]{.underline}**?

SEIB: **[[That is meaningful]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It's more
meaningful in a presidential election than a midterm election, but that
was really the Biden problem. The premise of the Biden presidency was
"the adults would be in charge," and the president would be somebody
who, unlike his predecessor, understood how the world works, knew how to
operate on the international stage, knew how to be an international
force for good. And the whole Afghan withdrawal mess called that all
into question. The advantage for President Biden is that his successful
implementation of the Ukraine policy has the potential, if not already
the impact, of returning the image of the Biden presidency back to where
people thought it was at the outset. I think there has already been a
return to a sense that the U.S. was leading the free world again, and
that's beneficial for everybody, frankly.

GAZETTE: If Russia appears to be regaining ground, what impact would
that have on Biden and the Democratic candidates running?

SEIB: There's two impacts: First, it's not great for President Biden
because the premise at this point here is that **[the [policy]{.mark} is
essentially working]{.underline}**. It has the Russians on their back
foot and in retreat. But if that's not the case anymore, then the way
**[this]{.underline}** **[[reflects on the president, and by extension
his party]{.underline}]{.mark}**, is different. Secondly, if things take
a bad turn, then there are going to be some difficult decisions the U.S.
will have to make that will have to be debated in political campaigns
this fall. How much further do we go with Ukrainians? Questions like
putting troops on the ground or sending military aircraft or making
deeper commitments to Ukraine politically, those will be back on the
table, so that changes the character and the nature and the substance of
the debate here politically.

Russian interference in the 2022 midterms," YAHOO NEWS,
https://news.yahoo.com/top-senate-democrats-sound-alarm-184723933.html

**[Top Senate Democrats are concerned about Russian interference in
2022]{.underline}**.

A group of senators urged leading national security and intelligence
officials to stay vigilant.

The Ukraine war has provided an avenue for Russian disinformation to
flourish in the US on the far right.

**[[Leading]{.mark} Senate [Dem]{.mark}ocrat[s]{.mark} [are sounding the
alarm about Russian interference in the]{.mark} 2022 [midterm]{.mark}
elections]{.underline}**.

A group of 17 Senate Democrats led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, chairwoman of
the Senate Rules Committee and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, urged some of the
nation\'s top military, intelligence, and national security officials to
stay vigilant against interference in a new letter obtained by Insider.

\"**[As the Russian invasion of [Ukraine has led to an increase
in]{.mark} Russian disinformation and warnings of potential
[cyberattacks]{.mark}, we urge you to ensure that your agencies are
prepared to quickly and effectively counter Russian influence campaigns
[targeting the 2022 elections]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" the senators
wrote in Thursday\'s letter.

The letter also cites an Insider report from March on how **[Putin\'s
missteps in Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine, which has staunchly united
the West and bolstered the NATO alliance while isolating Moscow
economically and politically, could spur the Kremlin to redouble its
efforts in undermining Western democracy through both cyberhacking and
disinformation operations that are far cheaper to carry out than a land
war on the scale of the Ukraine invasion]{.underline}**.

\"Manipulating social media is incredibly inexpensive compared to
Javelins and ammunition,\" Chris Rouland, the CEO of Phosphorus
Cybersecurity, told Insider. \"If anything, Russia would get more
aggressive in its manipulation of social media because it\'s almost free
compared to a tank.\"

Ex-NSA hacker David Kennedy, the CEO of TrustedSec, told Insider that
\"**[Putin and the intelligence agencies are going to look at how to
cause as much damage as possible\" through cyber
operations]{.underline}**.

He added that **[the US in particular is a \"ripe target\" for continued
Russian interference efforts because of the major impact Russia had in
influencing the 2016 election]{.underline}**.

Russia\'s successful history of meddling in the US \"underscores the
urgency\" for 2022, senators say.

**[[In 2016, Russia\'s interference]{.mark} campaign [included hacking
into]{.mark} the Hillary [Clinton]{.mark} campaign [and
D]{.mark}emocratic [N]{.mark}ational [C]{.mark}ommittee to obtain
damaging internal emails, attempting to compromise state voter
registration databases, and using bot and troll farms to spread
misinformation about the candidates and sow division and anger among the
American electorate on social media]{.underline}**.

Russia also interfered in the 2018 and 2020 elections, the US
intelligence community found, by focusing less on cyber hacking and more
on manipulating the information environment through social media, state
media, online journals, and proxies.

\"**[[Russia\'s history of interfering in]{.mark} our last three
[federal election cycles underscores the]{.mark} urgency of the current
[warnings]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" the senators wrote in the letter.

into a recast election-year pitch to voters," WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/03/12/biden-ukraine-russia-midterms/

President **[Biden and his party have moved in recent days to reorient
their election-year pitch to voters around Russia's invasion of Ukraine
--- seeking to shift blame for struggles to tame rising prices onto
Vladimir Putin and promoting the White House strategy to punish the
Kremlin as a muscular response to a geopolitical threat]{.underline}**.

**[Democrats]{.underline}** said they **[hope the
message]{.underline}**, which they honed in political meetings over the
past week, **[will help address some of their biggest liabilities ahead
of the November midterm elections]{.underline}**. Chief among them are
Biden's low approval ratings and a widespread perception that Democrats
are at fault for a sharp increase in inflation.

Now, Biden is repeatedly bringing up "Putin's price hike" at the pump.
White House officials have distributed talking points to allies urging
them to echo this line. And Democrats are touting the economic sanctions
Biden has leveled on Russia, contrasting them with former president
Donald Trump's praise for Putin.

### A2 GOP rally against the plan

#### GOP is divided -- NATO still has a large base of support 

Ashley **[Parker]{.underline}**, Marianna **[Sotomayor
and]{.underline}** Isaac **[Stanley-Becker April 29]{.underline}**,
2022, "Inside the Republican drift away from supporting the NATO
alliance," THE WASHINGTON POST,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/04/29/nato-republicans-trump/

**[Some]{.underline}** two dozen House **[GOP lawmakers who voted
for]{.underline}** the **[2019 NATO Support]{.underline}** Act **[voted
against]{.underline}** the similar resolution this month, which
reaffirmed support for **[the alliance]{.underline}** and its
principles. **[But]{.underline}** in interviews,
**[several]{.underline}** of those House **[Republicans]{.underline}**
said they **[still support the organization and simply objected to what
they viewed as problematic provisions]{.underline}** that Democrats had
added to the bill for perceived political purposes.

Several who switched their votes since 2019 objected to measures they
said did not specifically address strengthening NATO to help Ukraine.
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) found it particularly problematic that the
resolution instructed NATO to be involved when a country has "internal
threats from proponents on illiberalism," which he says could be
interpreted as conservatism.

"I am a huge supporter of NATO --- I served in the Air Force during the
Cold War, worked with NATO during that time period," he said. "These
issues should be left to those individual nations."

Loudermilk argued that **[Democrats]{.underline}** had **[inserted
"poison pills" into the symbolic resolution, which could be used against
Republicans in the 2022 midterms. "It was the Democrats trying to
politicize something and add things]{.underline}** in there that we have
no business working on," he said, explaining his vote against the bill.

Similarly, from Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (R-Ala.): "I am wholeheartedly,
unequivocally, without reservation, supportive on NATO."

But Aderholt said he worried that the resolution "had some language in
that I thought went on the political side. And I don't want to see NATO
go political. I want to see NATO stand up for, you know, what's going on
in Ukraine --- stand up for Ukraine against Russia."

The two bills are not exactly the same. The legislation in 2019
reaffirmed that federal money should not be used to remove the United
States from NATO --- which Trump was threatening at the time --- while
the bill from this month called on the government to "uphold the
founding democratic principles of NATO," as well for NATO "to continue
to provide unwavering support to the people of Ukraine as they fight for
their sovereignty, territorial integrity, and a democratic future."

"Donald **[Trump]{.underline}**'s political achievement in 2016 was to
sense the possibility for a new \[Republican\] coalition unseen since
before World War II," Dueck writes. "He did this not by reiterating

dictatorships in Latin America, and **[US defense

**[Domestic policy will likely dominate the politicking in Congress:

Ukraine]{.underline}**, like so many conflicts before it, **[has proved
that as much as politicians wish to focus on "nation building here at
home," global realities intrude]{.underline}**. Ukraine is the tip of
the iceberg, but Republicans have their eye on plenty of other issues as
well, including relations with China, the question of defending Taiwan,
the continued isolation of Russia, the Middle East (think energy, Iran,
and Israel), and, more broadly, defense spending. But before the
substance of the foreign-policy challenge hits the House and Senate
floors, the ideological question merits examination.

What\'s clear is that **[foreign affairs and geopolitics have returned
as issues that could shape the opinions of U.S. voters]{.underline}**.

Even **[as the midterm races intensify, Biden is devoting his time
to]{.underline}** other world leaders and not just Russian President
Vladimir Putin and his attack on Ukraine. Biden\'s trip to South Korea
and Japan follows recent meetings with the heads of Italy, Greece and
the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He is also
meeting with the leaders of Finland and Sweden, who are seeking

Terrorists and terrorist states have been potent, China is not becoming

### Impact -- turns NATO commitments

**[Many European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief when President
Biden, a staunch Atlanticist, denied Trump another term in
2020]{.underline}**. Now, 16 months later, **[[Biden's]{.mark} role in
marshaling Western allies behind Ukraine --- and his recent vow to
protect "every inch of NATO territory" --- has [alleviated doubt in
Europe about U.S. commitments]{.mark}, at least in the short
term]{.underline}**.

**[[But Europeans]{.mark} who were heartened by the outcome of the last
American election [are beginning to eye]{.mark} upcoming contests,
including [this year's midterms]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the 2024
presidential race. Their apprehension about a Republican takeover of
Congress, which could revive Trump's brand of foreign policy, is offset
by hope that Russia's invasion of Ukraine will strengthen the Republican
Party's internationalist wing and compel the party to lock arms with
Europe.

"I'm very concerned about the situation in America --- the split of the
society, the concentration on domestic issues, the underestimation of
the importance of America's international role," said Thomas de
Maizière, a former center-right lawmaker and high-ranking government
minister in Germany who co-chaired a NATO working group convened in
2020. "But there are Republicans we work excellently with, and I would
expect them to take on a larger role if their party takes power."

Whether that assessment reflects an accurate reading of **[[Republican
politics is]{.underline}]{.mark}** an open question. The answer,
however, is **[[existential in Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[where
the fallout from the war in [Ukraine has showcased the importance of
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and the limits of
aspirations for European autonomy on matters of technology and defense,
according to lawmakers and diplomats]{.underline}**.

**[Flash points are already coming into view]{.underline}**. In 2020,
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg started a working group aimed at
strengthening NATO. The group's final product, "NATO 2030: United for a
New Era," included proposals, such as the creation of a Center for
Democratic Resilience, that have been scorned by pro-Trump Republicans,
including many of the 63 Republicans who recently voted against the
House resolution affirming support for NATO.

### Afghanistan -- GOP reinvades

#### GOP wants to reinvade Afghanistan

Sam Brodey, Asawin Suebsaeng, and Justin **[Baragona '21,]{.underline}**
August 27, 2021, "GOP Hawks Rage: We Want Our Forever War Back," THE
DAILY BEAST,
https://www.thedailybeast.com/gop-hawks-rage-that-they-want-their-forever-war-back-after-kabul-attack

**[[Republican lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, former officials in
Donald Trump's administration, and conservative commentators are
reacting to Thursday's horrific Kabul attack by not only condemning the
Biden administration---**[they'[re]{.mark} also [calling for a
re-invasion of Afghanistan]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Sen. Lindsey **[[Graham]{.underline}]{.mark}** (R-SC), long an
Afghanistan war hawk who recently called on President Joe Biden to be
"impeached" for the withdrawal, **[[demanded]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
Twitter **[that [the administration "reestablish our
presence]{.mark}]{.underline}** in Bagram as an alternative to the Kabul
airport, saying it was a "problem of will" that it hadn't been done yet.

"The retaking of Bagram would put our military at risk, but I think
those involved in the operation would gladly accept that risk because it
would restore our honor as a nation and save lives," Graham continued.

**[Another GOP senator, Ben [Sasse]{.mark} of Nebraska, released a
statement [urging Biden to "reverse course and fight]{.mark} for our
people]{.underline}**," insisting that "weakness will accelerate the
bloodshed" while pushing the administration to "rip up the August 31
deadline" and expand its perimeter beyond Kabul. Sen. Marsha Blackburn
(R-TN) also demanded a "forceful response" from the president, saying he
"must follow through on his word \[and\] make these terrorists pay."

Democrats, meanwhile, spent Thursday sticking to expressions of
condolence and grief over the loss of U.S. service members and Afghan
civilians, with some offering a few scattered, toned-down references to
payback.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), for example, said in a
statement that "it must be clear to the world that the terrorists who
perpetrated this will be sought and brought to justice." And Sen. Dianne
Feinstein (D-CA), long considered a hawk within her party, said the
attack was a "tragic reminder that we must continue our counterterrorism
efforts in Afghanistan," which "includes making sure those responsible
for today's attacks are brought to justice."

The harshest language from any Democrat may have come from Biden
himself, speaking from the White House Thursday evening.

"To those who carried out this attack, as well as anyone who wishes
America harm, know this: We will not forgive. We will not forget. We
will hunt you down and make you pay," said Biden. "I will defend our
interests and our people with every measure at my command... We will
respond with force and precision at our time, at the place we choose and
the moment of our choosing."

Democrats' messaging focus centered almost entirely on backing up
Biden's withdrawal date and the effort to evacuate U.S. and Afghan
personnel safely. But a few lawmakers did offer some pointed criticism,
albeit narrow, toward the administration, as the prospect of continued
terror attacks jeopardizes the president's commitment to leave the
country by Aug. 31 while evacuating thousands of U.S. citizens and
Afghan allies.

Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH), one of the GOP's top targets ahead of the
2022 midterm election, said the U.S. must evacuate every citizen and
Afghan ally "regardless of any arbitrary deadlines"---a veiled shot at
Biden.

Officials who know the region well, like Rep. Andy Kim (D-NJ), also
questioned that deadline in the wake of what Kim told The Daily Beast
was a "catastrophic" day in Afghanistan.

"This attack really hurts," said Kim, who was the point person on
Afghanistan for Barack Obama's National Security Council. "It
underscores the danger that's there and why it is we need to complete
this mission."

"We cannot leave unless we've gotten every American that wants to go,"
Kim added. "I've heard the president say that, and I hope that's true."

Asked if he supported sending in additional troops to complete the
evacuation mission, as Republicans suggested, Kim said he would defer to
the Pentagon. But he added that if the president and his advisers
determined they needed more time, "more money, more troops, I will do
everything I humanly can from Congress."

**[[Various conservatives on Capitol Hill demanded]{.mark} brutal
reprisals, with the top Republican in the Senate calling for what would
amount to [a double-down]{.mark} on the global war on
terror]{.underline}**.

"**[The war is clearly not ended. You can't unilaterally end a war. It
takes two to tango and these people will never stop fighting us. Their
capabilities are still intact]{.underline}**," Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX)
said on Fox News on Thursday morning. "**[[We should retake]{.mark} more
airfields throughout [the country]{.mark}... It will take troops on the
ground and a complete reassessment of our strategy. The military can do
it. We need the will politically to do it]{.underline}**."

Rep. Mark Green (R-TN) was even blunter with his assessment, declaring
on Fox News that "all bets are off" because the Taliban didn't keep its
promise of safe passage to the Kabul airport, adding that America should
"expand this operation" and "start killing bad guys."

Senate Minority Leader Mitch **[[McConnell]{.underline}]{.mark}** (R-KY)
**[[reacted]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the attack by saying it offered
"the clearest possible reminder that terrorists will not stop fighting
the United States just because our politicians grow tired of fighting
them," **[[calling for a redoubling]{.underline}]{.mark}** of "our
global **[[efforts]{.underline}]{.mark}** to confront these barbarian
enemies who want to kill Americans and attack our homeland."

Blackburn also called for the president to resign or be removed from
office over the bloody terror attack, a mantra that was repeated by Sen.
Josh Hawley (R-MO), who had previously positioned himself as a "forever
war" critic.

"It is now clear beyond all doubt that he has neither the capacity nor
the will to lead. He must resign," Hawley tweeted on Thursday afternoon.

Former Trump National Security Adviser H.R.
**[[McMaster]{.underline}]{.mark}**, meanwhile, openly **[[speculated
that]{.underline}]{.mark}** ISIS-K and the Taliban may have worked in
conjunction on the suicide attacks despite the Taliban casualties and
the long-running hostilities between the two terror groups. "I would not
be surprised if ISIS-K was used as a cutout for the Taliban so they
could humiliate us on the way out," McMaster said on CNN.

"Was it worth it, really? What would be a better outcome? A
**[[sustained commitment]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a few thousand U.S.
troops who were continuing to **[[enable the Afghans to bear the
brunt]{.mark} of the fight or this catastrophe we're seeing
now]{.underline}**," McMaster added. "We have this 'end the endless
wars' narrative but this is an endless jihad against us and if we don't
acknowledge that we're putting ourselves at extraordinarily high risk."

Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), a Trump critic and another conservative
hawk, praised McMaster's remarks during multiple cable news hits on
Thursday. Also blasting the "end the endless war crowd," the Illinois
congressman exclaimed that the "endless war just got fired up again" and
that America's next decision will determine "the future of terrorism not
just in the region, but in this world."

Trump allies, who supported the former president's Taliban peace deal,
prisoner release, and negotiated troop withdrawal, quickly jumped at the
opportunity to blast the current administration while also calling for
increased military action.

"**[Air superiority is something we have always had in
Afghanistan]{.underline}**," former Trump Pentagon chief of staff Kash
**[[Patel said]{.underline}]{.mark}** during a Fox News appearance. "And
our predator program dominated the skies under President Trump, and
**[we can do that again if we [retake Bagram]{.mark} airfield because
that is the center country ops]{.underline}**."

#### GOP supports reinvasion

Kevin **[Robillard '21]{.underline}**, August 26, "Republicans Push
Biden To Re-Invade Afghanistan," HUFF POST, Republicans Push Biden To
Re-Invade Afghanistan

**[Republicans are pushing]{.underline}** President Joe Biden to take
**[actions that would amount to re-invading Afghanistan]{.underline}**
by either requiring the U.S. military to retake an abandoned air base or
staying in the country long enough to restart the dormant war with the
Taliban.

The calls were amplified Thursday following the deaths of a dozen U.S.
service members and more than 50 Afghan civilians in a pair of bombings
near the Kabul airport, the center of the American effort to evacuate
the country's wartime allies from Afghanistan. Intelligence officials
believe a branch of the self-styled Islamic State (ISIS) that has
battled the Taliban for influence are responsible for the attacks,
according to reports.

In a statement, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), who has long opposed efforts
under both Biden and President Donald Trump to end U.S. involvement in
the two-decade war, said Biden needed to "rip up the Aug. 31 deadline
and defend evacuation routes" by expanding the perimeter around the
Kabul airport or by retaking Bagram Air Base.

"You are the commander in chief, sir; reverse course and fight for our
people. This is likely to get worse, and **[weakness will accelerate the
bloodshed]{.underline}**," Sasse said.

Other **[Republicans]{.underline}** similarly **[suggested the United
States pour more troops into the country]{.underline}**.

### Afghanistan -- presence key

#### Afghanistan still key to U.S. hegemony -- must prevent China or Russia from monopolizing natural resources

JOHN C. **[HULSMAN '21,]{.underline}** November 2, 2021, Dr. John C.
Hulsman is president and managing partner of John C. Hulsman
Enterprises, a global political-risk consulting firm headquartered in
Milan, Germany and London, "America must get a lot better at playing the
new \'Great Game\'" THE HILL,
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/579159-america-must-get-a-lot-better-at-playing-the-new-great-game

The funny thing about history, as Mark Twain shrewdly put it, is that it
does not repeat itself but it often rhymes. **[[Following the]{.mark}
dramatic [collapse of America's occupation of Afghanistan, a new Great
Game is already advancing, with]{.mark}]{.underline}** three players:
**[[China, Russia]{.mark} and the U.S]{.underline}**./European Union.

Yet today's Great Game 2.0 is far more multidimensional than the
strategic contest of Kipling's day. The new game will be played on more
levels than the old one was, with diplomatic, economic, cultural,
espionage and military maneuverings short of all-out war determining the
outcome of the contest.

Another difference is that, this time around, the Central Asian states
of the region have far more agency in terms of determining their own
fates, looking to retain true independence and sovereignty amid the
great powers.

Of course, **[[the U.S. retains significant interests in the]{.mark}
vast [Central Asian region]{.mark}, the center of the pivotal Eurasian
landmass. The neo-conservatives' disastrously wrongheaded
nation-building agenda must not be allowed to obscure this
reality]{.underline}**.

**[[To "win"]{.mark} the game, enhancing its interests at the expense of
its great power rivals, the U.S. must be infinitely strategically
smarter than it has been over the past generation regarding the Central
Asian region. First, [the U.S. must accept the continuing need to play
the Great Game]{.mark} itself]{.underline}**. With the chaotic fall of
Kabul, there is a real fear that ISIS Khorasan, al Qaeda and other
jihadi organizations will reconstitute themselves in Central Asia, since
the Taliban --- even if their highly problematic pledges to spurn the
terror groups are accepted --- has limited control of Afghanistan's
porous borders.

Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testifying
before the House Armed Services Committee, gloomily estimated that al
Qaeda could reconstitute itself in Afghanistan in merely six to 36
months. Stopping this from happening by having limited but lethal assets
in the region to halt Osama bin Laden's heirs from attacking the
American homeland still amounts to an overwhelming primary American
national security interest.

**[[The]{.mark} second [primary U.S.]{.mark} national [interest at
play]{.mark} in the new Great Game [is keeping either rival great power,
China or Russia, from]{.mark} wholly [dominating]{.mark} the Eurasian
heartland, replete with its [vast natural
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Particularly, rising China, the
architect of the \$2 trillion Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)
encompassing the region, must not be left to solely economically
dominate Eurasia.

#### Presence key to block Russia-China coop

ELIZABETH **[WISHNICK '21,]{.underline}** November 8, 2021, Elizabeth
Wishnick, Ph.D., is a professor of political science at Montclair State
University and a senior research scholar at the Weatherhead East Asian
Institute, Columbia University, "PROSPECTS FOR SINO-RUSSIAN COORDINATION
IN AFGHANISTAN," WAR ON THE ROCKS,
https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/prospects-for-sino-russian-coordination-in-afghanistan/

**[[The]{.mark} increasingly close bilateral [relationship between China
and Russia is]{.mark} one of the most interesting,
[consequential]{.mark}, and surprising geopolitical developments since
the end of the Cold War]{.underline}**. Beijing and Moscow --- once
bitter adversaries --- now cooperate on military issues, cyber security,
high technology, and in outer space, among other areas. While it falls
short of an alliance, the deepening Sino-Russian partnership confounds
**[[U.S. strategists]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Some have **[[proposed
driving a wedge between the two]{.mark} countries]{.underline}**, but
this seems unlikely for the foreseeable future.

Some have speculated that **[[China and Russia might cooperate in
Afghanistan to exploit]{.mark} the chaos left by the [U.S.
withdrawal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But is that true? Does the fall of
Kabul to the Taliban pave the way for greater Sino-Russian coordination
in Afghanistan?

In the immediate aftermath of the Taliban takeover, **[China and Russia
seemed to have pursued shared interests and avoided undercutting each
other]{.underline}**. The two countries have engaged in some parallel
actions of late by holding military exercises with Central Asian
partners --- both bilaterally and within the framework of the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization. Russia has been expanding its economic
cooperation and diplomatic outreach with Pakistan, while China
perseveres in developing the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key
artery of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Despite recent cooperation in the region, Chinese and Russian interests
in Central and South Asia are not identical. China aims to integrate
these regions economically into the Belt and Road Initiative, while
keeping Indian influence at bay and addressing perceived security
threats to the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. By contrast, Russia's
objectives are to maintain its role as the primary security provider in
what it sees as the greater Eurasian region and to balance its
longstanding ties with India with a new approach to Pakistan. China and
Russia share some positions on broader security considerations --- such
as a concern over the expansion of terrorism and drug-trafficking
threats from Afghanistan --- but they part company on certain key
regional issues, notably the role of India, mechanisms for providing
security in Central Asia, and recognition of the Taliban.

In Afghanistan, as in several other areas of their joint interaction,
China and Russia project an appearance of coordination, but in practice
their differing regional interests and identities set real limits.

Opportunities for Sino-Russian Coordination

At first glance, **[the [U.S. exit from Afghanistan seems to present new
avenues for Sino-Russian coordination]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China
claims to want to work with Russia on Afghanistan, or at least to appear
to be doing so. On Sept. 16, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Russian
counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that "China is ready to strengthen
coordination with Russia to jointly handle the issue of Afghanistan."
Lavrov has spoken similarly of working with China to "jointly manage
changes" in Afghanistan.

Just prior to the collapse of the Afghan government, China and Russia
celebrated the 20th anniversary of their treaty of friendship,
good-neighborliness, and cooperation, signed in July 2001. Since 2019,
**[the two]{.underline}** neighbors have proclaimed that they **[have
established a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a
new era]{.underline}**, the epitome of strategic partnerships in the
Chinese lexicon.

In some respects, China and Russia appear to share the same playbook on
Afghanistan. **[Both blame the United States for the current
chaos]{.underline}**, and oppose U.N. measures to hold the Taliban to
account on human rights. For instance, Beijing and Moscow voted against
the appointment of a U.N. rapporteur for human rights issues in
Afghanistan. They have also taken some complementary initiatives in
Central Asia to boost their individual security cooperation with Central
Asian states.

#### Lack of U.S. reinvasion prompts Russia-China partnership in Afghanistan

BRADLEY **[JARDINE AND]{.underline}** EDWARD **[LEMON
'21,]{.underline}** October 7, 2021, Jardine is a global fellow at the
Wilson Center's Kissinger Institute on China and the United States,
Lemon is a research assistant professor at the Bush School of Government
and Public Service "IN POST-AMERICAN CENTRAL ASIA, RUSSIA AND CHINA ARE
TIGHTENING THEIR GRIP," WAR ON THE ROCKS,
https://warontherocks.com/2021/10/in-post-american-central-asia-russia-and-china-are-tightening-their-grip/

Although America's war in Central Asia may be ending, worries over
potential conflict in the region remain high. On Oct. 1, following a war
of words between Tajikistan's government and the Taliban, the Russian
foreign ministry raised concerns "about the growing tension in
Tajik-Afghan relations against the background of the mutually
acrimonious statements by the leaders of both countries." **[[In]{.mark}
the wake of ongoing uncertainty about [Afghanistan]{.mark}'s future, the
Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization is planning an
unprecedented four exercises on the Tajik-Afghan border in October, all
simulating an armed incursion]{.underline}**.

States in Central Asia bordering this area are increasingly leaning on
external partners to shore up their defenses. **[[As the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [exits]{.mark} the region, [Russia and China are ramping
up]{.mark} their security assistance]{.underline}**. Still, current
trends do not point toward a great-power competition in the region
between these two nations.

Just days after the Taliban marched into Kabul, Russia held two military
exercises with Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. The second, larger exercise
took place only 20 kilometers from the Afghan border and involved 2,500
Russian, Tajik, and Uzbek troops, as well as tanks, armored personnel
carriers, attack jets, helicopters, and other weaponry in a simulated
joint response to cross-border militant attack.

China is also enhancing its security presence. A few days after the
Russian exercise concluded, China's powerful Ministry of Public Security
held counter-terrorism drills with its Tajik counterparts. China's
strategic activity in Tajikistan has grown significantly since it opened
a small military facility in the country near the border with
Afghanistan in 2016. It even undertook drills with the Ministry of
Public Security --- the first international training activities it had
ever conducted.

Afghanistan, and China's fixation on the idea of Uyghur militants
returning from Central Asia to set up camps, has driven an unprecedented
level of Chinese security activities in neighboring states. In 2014,
General Secretary Xi Jinping made a number of secret speeches in the
bordering Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, since leaked to the New
York Times, in which he expressed concern that "Uyghur fighters" could
use Tajik territory as a transit zone to staging attacks in China.
However, there is no evidence of Uyghur militants operating out of
Tajikistan. In fact, recent International Criminal Court filings suggest
the country's Uyghur population has dramatically plummeted following
in-country raids on Tajik territory by Chinese security services,
targeting civilians in bazaars across the country.

**[[China and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** are bound by several
interests in Central Asia. Both share a concern about the region
becoming a source of terrorism. Both want to contain any instability
that may emanate from Afghanistan. And **[[both want to push the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [out]{.mark} of the
region]{.underline}**. This last goal has been realized, but neither
Russia nor China can really take the credit for it.

Goodbye, America

**[[With]{.mark} the U.S. [troop withdrawal from Afghanistan,
Washington's]{.mark} already limited role in the region looks [set to
diminish]{.mark} further]{.underline}**. Prospects of a return of U.S.
troops after the withdrawal were met with limited interest from Central
Asian governments.

### Afghanistan -- terrorism

#### Reoccupation key to check terrorism

Ben **[Wolfgang '21,]{.underline}** November 8, 2021, "Outside looking
in: After Afghanistan, U.S. scrambles for bases in central Asia,"
WASHINGTON TIMES,
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/nov/8/us-scrambles-bases-central-asia-after-afghanistan-/

"We are in conversations with Pakistan to keep the air line of
communication open. We have also had conversations with Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan," Colin Kahl, the Pentagon's undersecretary of defense for
policy, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week **[[after
lawmakers pressed him on America's long-term counterterrorism strategy
in and around Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Questions have been raised about what the
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration **[[may be willing
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** offer in **[[return for basing U.S.
counterterrorism assets]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand,
New York Democrat, pressed Mr. Kahl on that question last week.

"We have some very specific ideas, but on that score ... it is very
sensitive," he said. He told lawmakers he would discuss details in a
classified setting.

The State Department also offered little clarity on where the effort
stands.

"**[[Fighting]{.mark} the scourge of [terrorism is a global effort. We
will continue to engage]{.mark}]{.underline}** partners, allies, and
**[[key states]{.underline}]{.mark}** around the world on how best to
address it," a State Department spokesperson said in a statement to The
Washington Times. "Beyond that, we have nothing further to share
regarding our deliberations on counterterrorism scenarios."

### A2 Afghanistan presence bad

#### No unique turns -- the U.S. will reimpose in Central Asia inevitably, question of "where" not "if"

Ben **[Wolfgang '21,]{.underline}** November 8, 2021, "Outside looking
in: After Afghanistan, U.S. scrambles for bases in central Asia,"
WASHINGTON TIMES,
https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/nov/8/us-scrambles-bases-central-asia-after-afghanistan-/

**[President [Biden is racing to find partners in Central Asia willing
to host U.S. troops]{.mark}, equipment and intelligence assets that the
Pentagon says are vital to keep al Qaeda, ISIS and other extremist
outfits from launching deadly attacks out of Afghanistan]{.underline}**,
even as China and Russia expand their power in the strategically vital
region and work to elbow out Washington.

More than two months after the last troops left Afghanistan, Pentagon
and State Department officials have been tight-lipped about
behind-the-scenes talks with Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and other nations
that represent the best long-term candidates to host American forces and
equipment. Among other things, a base in one of those countries would
likely serve as a U.S. hub for drone strikes against terrorists across
the theater, including targets that are expected to appear in
Afghanistan with the Taliban back in power.

U.S. manned and drone missions are currently organized out of bases in
the Middle East 1,000 miles from the Afghanistan theater, often too far
to make a difference when a target is sighted or a clash erupts. Taliban
leaders are adamantly opposed to allowing U.S. and allied forces back
into Afghanistan and insist they can deal with any terrorist operations
in the country.

**[[The U.S. struggle to secure a base in the region underscores a
shifting global power landscape]{.mark} that has left Mr. Biden with
limited leverage. The [withdrawal from Afghanistan fueled a]{.mark}
narrative that the U.S. is pulling back from the region, creating an
even bigger [window of opportunity for rivals]{.mark} that are [eager to
fill a power vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Indeed, some counterterrorism analysts say the White House has bungled
the process and hasn't proved it is more capable than its leading global
rival, China, at forging military alliances with governments in Central
Asia. Russia's significant sway and historical links in the region also
complicate the U.S. effort. The Kremlin is privately and publicly
lobbying Afghanistan's neighbors to refuse entreaties from Washington.

The U.S and its allies "bear the main responsibility among foreign
actors for normalizing life in Afghanistan since their presence actually
led to the current situation ...," Deputy Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Ryabkov told reporters after meeting with U.S. Undersecretary of
State Victoria Nuland for three days of talks in Moscow last month. "We
strongly reaffirmed the unacceptability to Russia of any form of U.S.
military presence in Central Asian countries," he said, according to the
Interfax news service.

Rising sense of urgency

**[The [lack of presence]{.mark} in an unstable part of the world [has
lent]{.mark} a [great]{.mark} deal of [urgency to the U.S. search for a
new base]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Analysts warn that **[[the current
dynamic is untenable]{.mark} and carries major security
risks]{.underline}**, even though the Pentagon insists its
"over-the-horizon" capabilities are sufficient.

This apparent **[decline of US hegemony has profound repercussions as it
urges many other great powers to move forward]{.underline}**. Today,
questions abound about how China will deal with Taiwan, Japan, etc., and
issues related to its regional interests. Although **[the United
States]{.underline}** may still possess the hegemonic power, it **[no
longer can unilaterally deter or enforce the actions of other great
powers]{.underline}**. Russia's involvement in the Syrian civil war, the
Iranian nuclear program, and aggression in the Arctic all clearly show
that the Russians no longer believe that the United States is fully
capable of containing or deterring their actions. Recent years have
shown that **[other major powers are testing how far the United States
will go to maintain its position in the system, and if the United States
is perceived to be weak or unwilling, the great powers will assert their
presence]{.underline}**. Certainly, Ukraine is the latest example of
Russia's ability to limit American hegemony.

Pignanelli: **[A handful in [the House and]{.mark} one in the [Senate is

**[[Yet in]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[many of [these swing areas Trump's

some fatigue from his presidential antics, Trump is the absolute face of
opposition to the Biden administration. Republican tacticians must be
extraordinarily disciplined and strategic in using this weapon wisely to
protect their advantage as the election season ramps up in a few months.
Too much or too little will cost them.

Webb: **[[Trump could]{.underline}]{.mark}** be a big
**[help]{.underline}** to all **[GOP candidates if he would [encourage
the base to vote]{.mark}]{.underline}**, criticize Democrats all he
wants, but stay out of primary battles and not demand personal fealty.
**[[But he is incapable]{.underline}]{.mark}** of such altruism
**[[and]{.mark} thus [will be a net drag on the

Is Trump gearing up to run for president in 2024?

Pignanelli: Trump is an extremely shrewd player. By consistently
vocalizing the objections to the Biden administration, he is dominating
the presidential contender field. **[[Trump wants
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[make his position as strong as possible as
he decides to [pull the trigger]{.mark} in late 2023]{.underline}**. But
there are number of external factors, including economy, his legal
issues and others which are just too remote to predict at this time.

Webb: I think Trump is running, **[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** I hope
I'm dead wrong. **[[Even as disastrous as]{.mark} the [Biden]{.mark}

#### No internal link between the midterms and 2024 

Geoffrey **[Skelley and]{.underline}** Jean **[Yi '22,]{.underline}**
February 25, "Stop Using The Midterms To Predict Presidential
Elections," FIVETHIRTYEIGHT,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-using-the-midterms-to-predict-presidential-elections/

**[The 2022 midterm election hasn't even happened yet, but speculation
about the 2024 presidential race is already underway]{.underline}**,
with many potential candidates positioning themselves for a possible run
--- and in the case of former President Donald Trump, doing so quite
publicly. **[Early general election polls are already testing Trump
against President Biden]{.underline}**, too, with many questioning
whether Biden will even run again in 2024, when he'd be 81 years old.
Some Democrats have even gone as far as to venture that a rough midterm
election for their party --- which seems quite possible --- might
discourage Biden from running again, opening the door for Vice President
Kamala Harris or another Democrat to win the party's nomination.

But while a strong Republican performance in 2022 might influence
Biden's thinking on 2024, **[it's a mistake to expect the midterm result
to predict how the country will vote in the ensuing presidential
election]{.underline}**. As the chart below shows, **[there's little
relationship]{.underline}** **[between the]{.underline}** margin in the
national popular vote for the U.S. House in a **[midterm election and
the national popular vote margin in the next presidential
contest]{.underline}**.1 **[So whatever happens in the House this
November, don't expect it to forecast the results of the next
presidential race.]{.underline}**

**[More often than not, midterm and presidential results have been miles
apart]{.underline}**. For instance, in 1994, the GOP captured Congress
in the midterm "Republican Revolution" amidst then-President Bill
Clinton's poor approval ratings, winning the House popular vote by about
7 percentage points. But in 1996, Clinton ended up claiming a sleepy
reelection victory by 8.5 points over Bob Dole --- a swing of more than
15 points. In fact, on average, there's been a swing of about 12 points
from the midterm to the subsequent presidential contest.

That said, midterm elections and their following presidential races have
sometimes run close together: Democrats swept back into power in the
2006 midterm election with an 8-point edge in the House vote, for
instance, and then-President Barack Obama won by a similar 7-point
margin nationally in 2008. In fact, midterm and presidential elections
have run closer together in recent years --- but importantly, there is
still not much of a relationship despite this. Rather, this seems to be
happening because landslide presidential wins are increasingly a thing
of the past. Instead, **[lopsided midterm results for the party not in
the White House are increasingly becoming the norm, then followed by
highly competitive presidential races]{.underline}**.

**[One big reason midterm and presidential elections have such different
outcomes is that they are fundamentally different kinds of
contests]{.underline}**. **[Midterm elections]{.underline}**, for
instance, **[tend to have much lower turnout than presidential
elections]{.underline}**, and what's more, **[voters from the party
that's not in the White House are often much more likely to turn
out.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[some voters switch]{.underline}**
from the president's party because of dissatisfaction with the status
quo. And because the president's party usually loses ground in a
midterm, you still often see narratives that suggest a president's
reelection chances may now be in peril just after a midterm election.

#### It's way too soon to predict 2024

Geoffrey **[Skelley and]{.underline}** Jean **[Yi '22,]{.underline}**
February 25, "Stop Using The Midterms To Predict Presidential
Elections," FIVETHIRTYEIGHT,
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/stop-using-the-midterms-to-predict-presidential-elections/

Yet presidents can, of course, change their approach following a
difficult midterm and/or their opponents in Congress can overstep after
winning power, both of which can help improve the president's public
standing. And perhaps **[most importantly]{.underline}**, **[two years
is a lifetime in politics]{.underline}**, **[leaving plenty of time for
important factors]{.underline}** **[like the state of the economy or war
and peace to change in meaningful ways that will influence the
electorate]{.underline}**. For instance, **[a struggling economy,
mediocre approval ratings, and a bad midterm can become a roaring
economy, "Morning Again In America," and a landslide
victory]{.underline}** in that narrow span of time, as was the case for
former President Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection bid.

Given all this, Biden and **[Democrats]{.underline}** who are uncertain
about the party's standing probably **[shouldn't look to the 2022
election result as a sign of]{.underline}** whether the president can
win in **[2024]{.underline}**. It's true that the midterm outcome could
alter the public's perception of Washington if Biden is facing off with
a GOP-controlled Congress. But the actual midterm results won't really
tell us whether Biden is doomed or can win reelection. After all, we
have no idea where things will stand in a couple years when it comes to
the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and the overall economy, much less
sudden developments like the U.S.'s potential role in the conflict in
Ukraine.

Of course, with all this said, **[it is]{.underline}** indeed **[fun to
take a look at the early polling of the 2024 race]{.underline}** ---
trust me, it's like catnip. **[Nevertheless, we need to take those early
polls with many grains of salt]{.underline}**. After all, even polls
taken six months out from the general election are only moderately
predictive of the final result --- and at that point, we usually know
who the nominees are.

The 2024 election is likely to be pretty competitive considering how
divided our politics are, but the candidates do matter at the margins.
So regardless of how many polls test Biden against Trump, time will tell
whether we will really see the first general election rematch since 1956
--- or if one or both parties end up nominating someone else entirely.
But one thing is for certain: **[The result this November will not
guarantee any result for November 2024.]{.underline}**

### Impact -- A2 Democracy

#### "Death of democracy" is a leftwing political strategy not a real risk

DAMON **[LINKER '21]{.underline}**, OCTOBER 19, "Do Democrats really
believe Republicans pose an existential threat to democracy?" THE WEEK,
<https://theweek.com/feature/1006142/do-democrats-really-believe-republicans-pose-an-existential-threat-to-democracy>

**[Do Democrats really believe Republicans pose an existential threat to
democracy]{.underline}**?

**[They say they do]{.underline}**, every day --- in Congress, in
op-eds, on cable news, in fundraising emails. **[But]{.underline}** do
**[their actions]{.underline}** in the White House and on Capitol Hill
confirm or **[belie it]{.underline}**?

The answer, I think, is the latter. This doesn\'t mean that Democrats
are intentionally lying to the country about the threat that Donald
Trump and his staunchest allies pose to American democracy. But it might
mean that many **[Democrats are lying to themselves]{.underline}** about
it. **[If these Democrats really believed what they are saying about
this threat, they would be making different decisions about the party\'s
priorities]{.underline}**.

What would Democrats be doing differently **[if they truly thought that
the country\'s other major party was working to eliminate free and fair
elections]{.underline}**? **[They would be prioritizing election
reform]{.underline}**. Not necessarily the kind of things contained in
the seemingly doomed Freedom to Vote Act, which is a grab bag of reforms
that federalize elections and make it easier to vote in various ways. I
have no objection to eliminating some barriers to voting, but that
doesn\'t address the vulnerability Trump exposed in the aftermath of the
2020 election. That vulnerability had to do with how votes are counted,
how electoral votes are allocated, and how both are certified within
states and in Congress.

This would mean, at the very least, overhauling the poorly drafted and
dangerously ambiguous Electoral Count Act of 1887. It\'s possible that
will happen between now and the party\'s likely loss of Congress in next
year\'s midterm elections. But **[it\'s hardly been a priority for
Democrats]{.underline}**.

What has been? **[Attempting to pass a massive spending bill favored by
the most progressive factions of the party]{.underline}**. As Matthew
Yglesias noted in a recent Substack post, this is the kind of high-risk
behavior one would expect if Democrats were simply trying to get as much
done before they lose control of Congress in the normal back-and-forth
of electoral politics. It **[is not the kind of behavior one would
expect from a party convinced that with their next victory Republicans
are going to rig the system so that Democrats can never win power
again]{.underline}**.

What kind of behavior would one expect? Probably, as Yglesias points
out, the kind of poll-driven calculus advocated by David Shor, the
data-crunching Democratic strategist well known for advising the party
to stop listening to the demands of progressive activists and lead with
their most broadly popular proposals. That\'s because Shor has been
partially driven to this position by his conviction that American
democracy is in grave danger. This is consistent --- as is his defense
of Democrats working to add states to the country in order to boost the
party\'s prospects in the Senate. **[If American democracy truly is at
risk of being snuffed out in the near future by the GOP, Democrats
should be more concerned about that than anything else, and acting
accordingly]{.underline}**.

Yet the party --- very much including its leader in the White House, who
ran for president warning about Donald Trump posing a potentially fatal
threat to \"the soul of America\" --- has chosen a different course.
Rather than seeking to pass reforms to ensure Republicans can\'t
overturn election results at the state level or in Congress and then
supporting a large but smaller, more tightly focused spending bill that
would be widely embraced, Democrats have acted like this was an ideal
time to dole out favors to every flavor of progressive activist in the
party. The result has been a decline in popularity for the president
largely driven by a precipitous loss of support from Democratic-leaning
independents.

Now, it\'s true that some on the left tilt their heads, squint their
eyes, and otherwise work very hard to convince themselves that this way
of proceeding is actually the best way of responding to the danger posed
by Republicans --- by addressing the economic problems confronting all
Americans, including those attracted to Trumpian lies about election
fraud. But that, again, is how you would talk and think if you
considered the GOP a normal party offering an alternative slate of
policies for the country. It\'s not a serious response to a movement
supposedly hell-bent on overturning American democracy in favor of
fascism or something fascist-adjacent.

But then **[why continually invoke a rhetoric of alarm]{.underline}**?
Perhaps **[because it\'s extremely effective at driving up turnout for
Democratic candidates]{.underline}**. One could say the same about most
Republican invocations of voter fraud. Though telling Republicans that
Democrats will inevitably cheat may convince a few GOP voters not to
bother showing up on Election Day, **[it]{.underline}** probably
**[convinces]{.underline}** far more that **[the party needs every
single vote it can get to overcome a system rigged against
them]{.underline}**.

There\'s already some anecdotal evidence that Democrats are helping
themselves with this two-step --- talking as if the GOP is an
existential threat to democracy but acting as if the really important
thing is passing progressive legislation. Just look at the Virginia
governor\'s race, where early voters are citing fear of Trump (who is of
course no longer president) as their primary reason for supporting
Democrat Terry McAuliffe against Republican Glenn Youngkin.

**[This doesn\'t mean the Democrats are engaging in a deliberate ruse.
It means they\'re folding their fears about Trump and the GOP into their
ideological agenda and then campaigning on election anxiety while
rewarding partisan supporters when they turn to
governing]{.underline}**.

#### Democracy is overrated -- accountability is not proven nor is solvency for war

Daniel **[Larison '12]{.underline}**, PhD in history from the University
of Chicago, "Democratic Peace Theory Is False," THE AMERICAN
CONSERVATIVE,
http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/democratic-peace-theory-is-false/

Rojas' claim depends entirely on the meaning of "genuine democracy."
Even though there are numerous examples of wars between states with
universal male suffrage and elected governments (including that little
dust-up known as WWI), the states in question probably don't qualify as
"genuine" democracies and so can't be used as counter-examples.
Regardless, **[democratic peace theory draws broad conclusions from a
short period in modern history with very few cases before the 20th
century. The core of democratic peace theory]{.underline}** as I
understand it **[is that democratic governments are more accountable to
their populations]{.underline}**, **[and because the people will bear
the costs of the war they are going to be less willing to
support]{.underline}** a **[war]{.underline}** policy.
**[This]{.underline}** supposedly **[keeps]{.underline}** democratic
states from waging wars against one another because of the built-in
electoral and **[institutional checks on government
power]{.underline}**. One small problem with **[this]{.underline}** is
that it **[is rubbish]{.underline}**.

[**Democracies in antiquity fought against one another**. Political
equality and voting do not abolish **conflicts of interest between
competing states. Democratic peace theory doesn't account for the
effects of nationalist and imperialist ideologies on the way democratic
nations think about war. Democratic nations that have professional
armies to do the fighting** for them are often enthusiastic about
overseas wars]{.underline}. The Conservative-Unionist government that
waged the South African War (against two states with elected
governments, I might add) enjoyed great popular support and won a huge
majority in the "Khaki" election that followed.

As long as it goes well and doesn't have too many costs, **[war can be
quite popular, and even if the war is costly it may still be popular if
it is fought for nationalist reasons that appeal to a majority of the
public]{.underline}**. If the public is whipped into thinking that there
is an intolerable foreign threat or if they believe that their country
can gain something at relatively low cost by going to war, the type of
government they have really is irrelevant. Unless a democratic public
believes that a military conflict will go badly for their military, they
may be ready to welcome the outbreak of a war that they expect to win.
[Setting aside the flaws and failures of U.S.-led democracy promotion
for a moment, **the idea that reducing the number of non-democracies
makes war less likely is just fantasy**. **Clashing interests between
states aren't going away, and the more democratic states there are in
the world the more likely it is that two or more of them will eventually
fight one another**.]{.underline}
