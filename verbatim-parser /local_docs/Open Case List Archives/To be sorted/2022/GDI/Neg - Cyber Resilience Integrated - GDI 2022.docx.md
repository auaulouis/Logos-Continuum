These **[predictions suggest that cyber operations will provide
significant strategic advantages]{.underline}** to Russia either as
complements to military force, or as standalone instruments --- or at
least that policymakers and commentators think that they will.
**[Current warnings of escalating cyber warfare conjure deep-seated
fears of cyber doom]{.underline}** and the recurring specter of a "cyber
Pearl Harbor" strategic surprise attack. **[In practice]{.underline}**,
however, **[[cyber warfare has been a failure]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Our research shows that **[[cyber operations have remained irrelevant on
the battlefield]{.mark}, while standalone operations]{.underline}** to
weaken Ukraine through **[[election interference, critical
infrastructure sabotage, and economic disruption]{.mark} largely [failed
to contribute]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Russia's strategic goals of
making Ukraine abandon its pro-European Union and pro-NATO foreign
policy. Consequently, **[[current fears]{.mark} of cyber warfare defy
not only Russia's track record in Ukraine, but also [strategic
logic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Given that **[[Russia's cyber operations
have failed to produce significant strategic value]{.mark} to date, why
would we expect this to suddenly change]{.underline}** now? Or, to put
it more pointedly: **[If cyber operations offer such effective and
potent instruments, why did Russia go through the trouble]{.underline}**
(and costs) to **[mobilize its troops? Current predictions of cyber
onslaught do not offer a persuasive answer.]{.underline}**

Giving in to these fears risks fighting phantom threats, playing into
Russia's hands by distracting from the need to counter its military
threat and sowing fear and confusion --- at least among Western
audiences. **[A level-headed analysis of the threat that distinguishes
what is theoretically possible from what is practically feasible is
urgently needed]{.underline}**. **[Our research suggests
that,]{.underline}** contrary to hysteria, **[[cyber operations will
remain of secondary importance]{.mark} and at best provide marginal
gains to Russia.]{.underline}**

Expectations Versus Evidence: Cyber Operations and Their Limits

There are three distinct perspectives on the strategic role and value of
cyber operations in conflict. Early scholarship on cyber conflict
expected cyber operations to be primarily important in conventional
military conflict, enabling crippling strategic strikes analogous to the
surprise attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II. If successful,
cyber operations could thus be substituted for the use of force. Yet
research throughout the 2010s made the limitations of cyber operations
as a means of force projection increasingly clear.

Subsequent scholarship thus sees cyber operations primarily as
complements to force. Possible effects include disrupting command and
control and communications systems, sabotaging equipment and
infrastructure, spreading disinformation, and conducting psychological
warfare to undermine morale among enemy troops.

The third and increasingly influential perspective instead suggests
cyber operations are primarily relevant in "gray zone" conflict short of
war. In this view, cyber operations offer standalone instruments of
power that can influence and weaken an adversary through critical
infrastructure sabotage, economic disruption, and influence operations.
Hence, as in cyber Pearl Harbor scenarios, it also suggests that cyber
operations could substitute for the use of force --- achieving similar
goals without going to war. However, rather than through a massive
surprise strike, this third school of thought expects the effects to be
gradual and cumulative, eroding adversary strength over multiple
operations.

**[The [empirical record]{.mark} of cyber conflict]{.underline}**,
however, **[[suggests that what is feasible]{.mark} in practice [is far
more limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Ukraine has been a "giant test
lab]{.underline}**" where Russia, one of the world's foremost cyber
powers, has experimented with cyber operations for eight years. Yet
**[these operations have failed to produce significant strategic
value]{.underline}** either as force complements or standalone tools.

**[[The substitutability argument]{.mark} --- that states can or do
substitute cyber operations for the use of force --- [has little
empirical support]{.mark}]{.underline}** since Russia levied no major
cyber operations against Ukraine in the runup to the military escalation
of the conflict in 2014. While it is possible that we do not know about
such operations given their veil of secrecy, it is clear that any
attempted but undetected cyber surprise strike failed to produce any
measurable effects.

**[[Evidence supporting the complementarity perspective is similarly
sobering]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One of us has examined the role of
low-level disruptive cyber operations in the military conflict and their
relevance for battlefield events (and outcomes). Disruptive attacks can
directly affect military operations as they seek to sabotage an
opponent's ability to fight. For example, the Russia-backed separatists
in the Donbas and Luhansk regions used malware to retrieve data from
mobile devices on the locations of Ukrainian artillery troops,
facilitating better reconnaissance against these troops. Pro-Ukrainian
hackers hijacked CCTV cameras behind enemy lines to obtain intelligence
on the movement of Russian artillery in the separatist-controlled
territories.

Focusing on the period of the most intense fighting, between 2014 and
2016 --- the time when, if cyber tools are an effective complement to
armed force, Russia would have been most likely to use them --- we
applied a series of statistical tests to thousands of cyber and military
operations. The findings showed a strong, escalatory dynamic between
military operations by both sides but no significant correlation in
either direction between military and cyber operations, and no
reciprocity between cyber operations. This evidence demonstrates that in
one of the first armed conflicts where both sides used low-level cyber
operations extensively, digital operations unfolded independently from
the events on the ground and had no discernible effect on them. Hence,
in stark contrast to expectations about the force-multiplying advantages
of cyber operations, these findings suggest hacking groups faced
considerable difficulties in responding to battlefield events, much less
shaping them.

Finally, **[the track record of [cyber operations]{.mark} as standalone
instruments in gray zone conflict [in Ukraine]{.mark} also [falls far
short of expectations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One of us has examined the
operational mechanisms, effects, and strategic value of five major
Russia-sponsored cyber operations, including election interference,
critical infrastructure sabotage, and economic disruption. Contrary to
prevailing expectations, the majority made no measurable contribution
towards Russia's strategic goals. The NotPetya operation, whose
large-scale disruption of businesses wiped off half a percentage point
of Ukraine's gross domestic product in 2017, is the exception. Yet this
operation underlined a key shortcoming of cyber operations: the risk of
losing control over the spread of effects, producing unintended
consequences, added costs, and correspondingly lowering strategic value.
Forensic analysis by internet security company ESET revealed that the
Sandworm hacking group underestimated how far NotPetya's data-destroying
malware would spread. It "went out of control" and spread far beyond
Ukraine, even disrupting targets in Russia --- including the
state-controlled oil giant Rosneft. These disruptions within Russia will
have caused additional costs, as did the sanctions that Western
countries imposed on Russia in response to NotPetya's international
disruption.

**[Evidence from Ukraine thus supports neither the force substitute nor
the force complement argume]{.underline}**nt. Instead, cyber operations
have been most relevant as standalone, lower-intensity alternatives to
the use of force --- more in line with the third school of thought. Yet
by and large **[they fell short of providing measurable strategic value.
Indeed, all available evidence indicates that Russia's cyber warfare
efforts]{.underline}** against Ukraine --- combined with its larger gray
zone campaign --- **[have failed to make Ukraine abandon its
rapprochement with the West.]{.underline}** That is why Russia has
mobilized its army, attempting to prevent Ukraine from joining the
Western alliance through threat of invasion.

Plausible Threats in the Conflict Ahead

**[Considering the underwhelming track record of cyber warfare in
Ukraine to date, [there is little reason to expect cyber doom]{.mark} of
the kind that some now predict]{.underline}**. For these warnings of a
Russian cyber onslaught to become reality, cyber operations would need
to produce effects at a scope and scale that they have previously failed
to attain. Importantly, current warnings fail to make a persuasive case
on why we should expect such a transformation.

Rather, they rest on the implicit assumption that with the change in
strategic context, the role of cyber operations will change as well.
This comes out clearest in Maggie Miller's recent commentary suggesting
that military escalation in Ukraine would finally herald "a true
cyberwar" where Russia could "take down the power grid" or launch a
disinformation campaign to undermine the government in Kyiv. Dmitri
Alperovitch offers a more level-headed analysis, underlining that cyber
operations alone will fall short of achieving Russia's goals. However,
he also suggests that they can complement force as an "extension of
warfare itself," disrupting command and control to provide battlefield
advantages, sabotaging critical infrastructure, and undermining public
trust in the government to "send a powerful signal that resistance is
futile." Yet, as we have seen, Russia has attempted most of these
objectives in the past and has failed. Even in a full-scale invasion, we
have the same aggressor, with the same hacking groups, with the same
skill level going after the same sets of possible targets. Why would we
expect different results?

Changing the strategic context of deployment does not change the
mechanism of action that cyber operations rely upon to produce outcomes
--- and its intrinsic constraints. Cyber operations rely on a mechanism
of subversion that exploits vulnerabilities in adversary systems to use
them against the adversary. **[[This mechanism]{.mark} holds great
strategic promise but [poses significant operational challenges.]{.mark}
It requires creativity and cunning to remotely manipulating
complex]{.underline}** systems that others designed and operate without
alerting the victim to one's presence. **[These challenges produce an
operational trilemma between the speed, intensity of effects, and level
of control that actors have over these effects. This trilemma limits
strategic value, since in most circumstances cyber operations will be
too slow, too weak, and too volatile to contribute measurably to
strategic goals.]{.underline}** The constraining role of this trilemma
is evident across all five of Russia's disruptive cyber operations
against Ukraine thus far, underlining their relevance. Importantly, all
available evidence indicates that these intrinsic constraints limit the
strategic value of cyber operations regardless of strategic contexts.

A **[[catastrophic cyberattack]{.mark} was]{.underline}** first
**[predicted in the mid-1990s. Since then, predictions]{.underline}** of
a catastrophe **[have appeared regularly]{.underline}** and have entered
the popular consciousness**[.]{.underline}** As a trope, a cyber
catastrophe captures our imagination, but as analysis, **[it
[remains]{.mark} entirely [imaginary]{.mark} and is of dubious value as
a basis for policymaking[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There has never been a
catastrophic cyberattack. To qualify as **[a
[catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an event **[[must produce]{.mark}
damaging [mass]{.mark} effect, including [casualties]{.mark} and
destruction[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[fires that swept across
California]{.underline}** last summer **[were a catastrophe.
Covid]{.underline}**-19 **[has been a catastrophe]{.underline}**,
especially in countries with inadequate responses**[.]{.underline}**
With man-made actions, however, a catastrophe is harder to produce than
it may seem, and **[for [cyber]{.mark}attacks a [catastrophe
requires]{.mark} organizational and [technical
skills]{.mark}]{.underline}** most **[[actors]{.mark} still [do not
possess.]{.mark}]{.underline}** It requires planning, reconnaissance to
find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building attack
tools---things that require resources and experience. To achieve mass
effect, either a few central targets (like an electrical grid) need to
be hit or multiple targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is
the case with urban water systems), something that is itself an
operational challenge. It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to
produce it. The 2003 East Coast blackout is the archetype for an attack
on the U.S. electrical grid. No one died in this blackout, and services
were restored in a few days. As electric production is digitized,
vulnerability increases, but many **[electrical companies have made
cybersecurity a priority.]{.underline}** Similarly, at water treatment
plants, the chemicals used to purify water are controlled in ways that
make mass releases difficult. In any case, it would take a massive
amount of chemicals to poison large rivers or lakes, more than most
companies keep on hand, and any release would quickly be diluted. More
importantly, **[there are powerful strategic constraints on those who
have the ability to launch catastrophe attacks. We have]{.underline}**
more than **[two decades of experience]{.underline}** with the use of
cyber techniques and operations for coercive and criminal purposes and
have a clear understanding of motives, capabilities, and intentions**[.
We can be guided by the]{.underline}** methods of the **[Strategic
Bombing Survey]{.underline}**, which used **[interviews]{.underline}**
and observation (**[rather than hypotheses]{.underline}**) to determine
effect**[.]{.underline}** These methods apply equally to cyberattacks.
The conclusions we can draw from this are: Nonstate actors and most
states lack the capability to launch attacks that cause physical damage
at any level, much less a catastrophe. There have been regular
predictions every year for over a decade that nonstate actors will
acquire these high-end cyber capabilities in two or three years in what
has become a cycle of repetition. The monetary return is negligible,
which dissuades the skilled cybercriminals (mostly Russian speaking) who
might have the necessary skills. One mystery is why these groups have
not been used as mercenaries, and this may reflect either a degree of
control by the Russian state (if it has forbidden mercenary acts) or a
degree of caution by criminals. **[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
enough [**[uncertainty]{.underline}** **[among potential attackers
about]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
[ability to attribute]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[that they are unwilling
to risk]{.mark} massive [retaliation]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in
response to a catastrophic attack[. (]{.mark}They are perfectly willing
to take the risk of attribution for]{.underline}**
**[espionage]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[coercive cyber
actions.)]{.underline}** No one has ever died from a cyberattack, and
only a handful of these attacks have produced physical damage. **[A
cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and]{.underline}** **[it is
intellectually lazy to equate them to nuclear weapons.]{.underline}**
Using a tactical nuclear weapon against an urban center would produce
several hundred thousand casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange
would cause tens of millions of casualties and immense physical
destruction. These are catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The
shadow of nuclear war distorts discussion of cyber warfare. **[State use
of cyber operations is consistent with their broad national strategies
and interests.]{.underline}** **[[Their]{.mark} primary [emphasis
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** on **[[espionage and]{.mark} political
[coercion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}** has **[[opponents]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and is in conflict with them, but they **[[have no interest in]{.mark}
launching [a catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[since it would]{.mark} certainly [produce]{.mark} an equally
[catastrophic retal]{.mark}iation[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Their goal is
to stay below the "use-of-force" threshold and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, not start a war. This has
implications for the discussion of **[inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}**, something that **[has]{.underline}** also
**[never occurred.]{.underline}** The concern over escalation deserves a
longer discussion, as there are both technological and strategic
constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and the
**[absence of inadvertent escalation suggests a high degree of control
for cyber capabilities by advanced states.]{.underline}**
**[Attackers]{.underline}**, particularly **[among the United States'
major opponents]{.underline}** for whom cyber is just one of the tools
for confrontation, **[seek to avoid actions that could trigger
escalation.]{.underline}** The United States has two opponents (China
and Russia) who are capable of damaging cyberattacks. **[Russia has
demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian power grid,
but]{.underline}** neither **[Russia]{.underline}** nor China **[would
be well served by a similar attack on the United States.]{.underline}**
Iran is improving and may reach the point where it could use
cyberattacks to cause major damage, but it would only do so when it has
decided to engage in a major armed conflict with the United States. Iran
might attack targets outside the United States and its allies with less
risk and continues to experiment with cyberattacks against Israeli
critical infrastructure. North Korea has not yet developed this kind of
capability. One major failing of **[catastrophe scenarios]{.underline}**
is that they **[discount]{.underline}** the **[robustness]{.underline}**
and resilience **[of modern economies.]{.underline}** These economies
present multiple targets and configurations; **[they are harder to
damage through cyberattack than they look, given the
growing]{.underline}** (albeit incomplete) **[attention to
cybersecurity; and experience shows that people compensate for damage
and quickly repair or rebuild.]{.underline}** This was one of the
counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey. Pre-war
planning assumed that civilian morale and production would crumple under
aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred. Resistance hardened
and production was restored.1 This is a short overview of why
catastrophe is unlikely. Several longer CSIS reports go into the reasons
in some detail. Past performance may not necessarily predict the future,
but **[[after 25 years without]{.mark} a single catastrophic
cyberattack]{.underline}**, we should invoke the concept cautiously, if
at all. **[[Why]{.mark} then, it is [raised so
often?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Some of the explanation for the emphasis
on cyber catastrophe is hortatory. When the author of one of **[[the
first reports]{.underline}]{.mark}** (**[in the 1990s]{.underline}**) to
sound the alarm over cyber catastrophe was asked later why he had warned
of a cyber Pearl Harbor when it was clear this was not going to happen,
his reply was that he **[[hoped to scare people into
action.]{.underline}]{.mark}** \"Catastrophe is nigh; we must act\" was
possibly a reasonable strategy 22 years ago, but no longer. The
resilience of historical events to remain culturally significant must be
taken into account for an objective assessment of cyber warfare, and
this will require the United States to discard some hypothetical
scenarios. **[[The]{.mark} long experience of living under the [shadow
of nuclear annihilation still shapes]{.mark} American [thinking]{.mark}
and conditions the United States [to expect extreme outcomes.]{.mark}
American thinking is [also]{.mark} shaped [by]{.mark} the experience of
[9/11]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[a wrenching attack that caught the
United States by surprise[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Fears of another 9/11
reinforce the memory of nuclear war in driving the catastrophe trope,
but when applied to cyberattack, these scenarios do not track with
operational requirements or the nature of opponent strategy and
planning. The contours of cyber warfare are emerging, but they are not
always what we discuss. Better policy will require greater objectivity.

### Cyber Ans: NC3 Attacks---1NC

#### No C3 vulnerability---proprietary design, redundancy, airgapping, human safeguards

Force, "The Cyber Threat to Deterrence," WAR ON THE ROCKS, 2---1---16,

The **[[perception that cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}** threats
**[[will]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultimately
**[[undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** the relevance or effectiveness of
nuclear **[[deterrence is flawed]{.underline}]{.mark}** in at least
three keys areas. First among these is the perception that nuclear
weapons or their command and control systems are similar to a heavily
defended corporate network. The critical error in this analogy is that
there is an expectation of IP-based availability that simply does not
exist in the case of **[[American]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}**lear weapon**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--- they **[[are not online]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[Even with
physical access]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
**[[proprietary]{.underline}]{.mark}** nature of their control system
**[[design and redundancy of]{.underline}]{.mark}** the National Command
and Control System (**[[NCCS]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
**[[makes]{.underline}]{.mark}** the possibility of successfully
implementing an exploit against either a weapon or communications system
**[[incredibly remote]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Also, whereas the cyber
domain is characterized by significant levels of risk due to a
combination of bias toward automated safeguards and the liability of
single human failures, **[[nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}**lear weapon
**[[safety]{.underline}]{.mark}** and surety are **[[predicated
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** balanced elements of **[[stringent human
interaction and control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. From two-person
integrity in physical inspections and loading, to the rigorous
mechanisms and authority required for weapons release, **[[human beings
serve as a multi-factor safeguard]{.underline}]{.mark}** while retaining
the ultimate role to protect the integrity of nuclear deterrence against
cyber threats.

To a large degree, the potential vulnerabilities caused by wireless
communications and physical intrusions into areas holding nuclear
material are already mitigated via secure
**[[communications]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[are not linked to the
outside]{.underline}]{.mark}** and multiple layers of physical security
systems. While there has been a great deal of publicity surrounding the
Y-12 break-in of 2012, the truth is that the three people involved never
got near any nuclear material or technology.

Without state-level resourcing in the billions of dollars, the technical
sophistication required to pursue a Stuxnet-like attack against nuclear
weapons is most likely beyond the capability of even the most gifted
group of hackers. For all intents, this excludes terrorist organizations
and cyber criminals from the field of threats and restricts it to those
nations that already possess nuclear weapons. Nuclear-weapon states,
however, have the full-spectrum cyber threat capability referenced in
the Defense Science Board report and would most likely be influenced by
an understanding of the elements of classic nuclear deterrence strategy.
In the case of first strike, no cyber weapon could be expected to
perform at a rate higher than any conventional anti-nuclear capability
(i.e., not 100 percent effective). Therefore, an adversary's nuclear
threat would be perceived to endure, thereby negating and dissuading the
effort to use and employ a cyber weapon against an adversary's nuclear
force. Additionally, just as missile defense systems have been
historically controversial due to perceived destabilizing effects, it is
reasonable to conclude that these nuclear-weapon states would view the
attempt to deploy a cyber capability against their nuclear stockpiles
from a similar perspective.

Finally, the very existence of nuclear weapons is often enough to alter
the risk analysis of an adversary. With virtually no chance of remote or
unauthorized detonation (which would be the desired results of a
sabotage event), the most probable cyber threat to any nuclear stockpile
is that of espionage. Attempted cyber intrusions at the U.S. National
Nuclear Security Agency (NNSA) and its efforts to bolster cybersecurity
initiatives provide clear evidence that this is already underway.
However, theft of design information or even more robust intelligence on
the location of stored nuclear weapons cannot eliminate the potential
destruction that even a handful of nuclear weapons can bring to an
adversary. Knowledge alone, particularly the imperfect knowledge that
cyber espionage is likely to offer, is incapable of drastically altering
an adversary's risk calculus. In fact, quite the opposite is true. An
adversary with greater understanding of the nuclear capabilities of a
rival is forced to consider courses of action to prevent escalation,
potentially increasing the credibility of a state's nuclear deterrence.

Despite the growing sophistication in cyber capabilities and the
willingness to use them for espionage or in concert with kinetic attack,
the strategic value of nuclear weapons has not been diminished. The
insulated architecture combined with a robust and redundant
command-and-control system makes the existence of any viable cyber
threat of exploitation extremely low. With the list of capable
adversaries limited by both funding and motivation, it is highly
unlikely that any nation will possess, or even attempt to develop, a
cyber weapon sufficient to undermine the credibility of nuclear weapons.
In both psychological and physical terms, the threat of the megabyte
will never possess the ability to overshadow the destructive force of
the megaton. Although the employment of cyberspace for military effect
has brought new challenges to the international community, the role of
nuclear weapons and their associated deterrence against open and
unconstrained global aggression are as relevant now as they were in the
Cold War.

that the **[[increasing complexity of newer nuclear weapon

recognize that its nuclear weapon systems and critical infrastructure
are currently vulnerable to cyber sabotage and will remain so going
forward. **[[Because the opponent's cyber intrusions are intended to be

the regime that has been built around the UNGGEs]{.underline}**. These
criticisms can be considered a standalone metacontestation over the
existing UN process writ large. Its critics question whether the UN
process has been sufciently impactful, whether it is worth pursuing
further, and whether it ought to be replaced with a diferent process.
**[[These arguments]{.mark} [focus on]{.mark} (1) [the broad
scop]{.mark}e and vague nature of agreements, (2) [the inadequacy of
addressing the deteriorating security environment]{.mark}, (3) [the
hidden agendas,]{.mark} including hypocrisy, of some stakeholders, and
(4) [the disconnect between those negotiating and those carrying out
ofensive operations.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

1\. Broad scope and vague nature of agreements A common critique from
ofcials in national security agencies is that **[[the framework
developed]{.mark} by the UNGGE [is too broad]{.mark} and too vague to be
truly effective at establishing rules of the road adhered to by those
carrying out offensive cyber]{.underline}** operations (Burgess 2018;
Baker 2017; Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018). Their skepticism refects
the still nascent and continuously maturing understanding of the
technology's impact on the balance of power, its use as an instrument of
statecraft, and the security dilemma that is as present online as it is
ofine. As an alternative approach, this group of stakeholders proposes
to focus on agreements based on emerging state practice and more
narrowly defined areas of common interest as the basis for cyber norms
that could then be expanded over time (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018;
Fischerkeller 2018).

2\. **[Inadequacy of addressing deteriorating security environment A
separate point of critique of the UNGGE process makes the opposite
argument.]{.underline}** Instead of viewing the UNGGE's framework as too
broad and ambitious, this separate camp of critics argues that **[[the
UNGGE process has not been ambitious enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They
see a functional need for international cooperation among governments
and transnational cooperation among nongovernmental actors to address
the deteriorating cybersecurity environment. A **[leading voice of this
group is the multinational company Microsoft. After years of being
involved in international cyber norms discussions, Microsoft
CEO]{.underline}** Brad Smith **[elevated the company's engagement to an
unprecedented level by calling for a Digital Geneva
Conventio]{.underline}**n (Smith 2017; Meredith 2018). In the wake of
the economic costs caused by the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya, these
voices have become louder with a growing number of CEOs joining the
chorus (Greenberg 2018; Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018; Siemens 2018).
In addition, the UN Secretary General made the topic a priority in 2018
supporting a more ambitious agenda (Khalip 2018; Fidler 2018).

**[This group of norm entrepreneurs remains very active trying to
further advance the cyber norms]{.underline}** discussion by keeping the
pressure on governments.26 For example, Microsoft broadened its eforts
beyond its engagement as a single company by creating the 'Tech Accord'
consortium counting more than 70 global companies at the beginning of
2019 (Cybersecurity Tech Accord 2018). In late 2017, Siemens established
a nonrival network of a dozen companies creating a 'Charter of Trust'
focusing specifcally on supply chain integrity (Siemens 2018).
Meanwhile, the Dutch government led the charge to add a norm protecting
the core of the Internet to the list of norms agreed to through the 2015
UNGGE (Broeders 2016). The French government's desire to maximize the
impact of the Paris Peace Forum launched in 2018 at the 100th
anniversary of the end of World War I led to the adoption of the Paris
Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace in November 2018 that
explicitly references the norm to protect the core of the Internet
(France Diplomatie 2018). The Paris Call has also been described as an
umbrella framework for the activities of various norm entrepreneurs.27

3\. **[[Hidden agendas]{.mark} Those promoting a more ambitious agenda
have encountered a number of challenges]{.underline}** due to the
dynamics among and within governments. First, among governments, calls
for a treaty have been met with resistance by Western governments.
**[[Concerned about Moscow's true intentions]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
these governments worry that any push for a treaty will empower Moscow's
longstanding proposal. Their concerns explain continued resistance by
Washington and Western capitals with respect to the draft International
Code of Conduct that Moscow and Beijing developed in 2011, updated in
2015, and have been promoting since (see McKune 2015.) **[They also help
explain why Microsoft's call for a Digital Geneva Convention has met
similar resistance and illustrate that overcoming this path dependence
would require exceptional circumstances.]{.underline}** **[Second,
within governments, national security agencies are reluctant to
internalize and adhere to the norms refected in the UNGGE]{.underline}**
agreements due to the still nascent understanding of the domain, a
related desire to preserve options until a mature strategic framework
has emerged, and the dynamics of the security dilemma (Burgess 2018,
Efrony and Shany 2018). A good illustration of this still maturing
understanding of the technology is the argument promoted by some that
there is moral obligation to use hacking instead of conventional
weaponry if the efects of the former are less harmful than the latter
(Hollis 2014).

4\. **[Disconnect between those negotiating and those conducting
ofensive cyber operations A fnal obstacle worth mentioning---rather in
form of a hypothesis than conclusive analysis---is that [a particular
challenge for negotiating cyber norms may]{.mark} be that the conduct of
ofensive [cyber operations]{.mark} originated in and [continues to be
closely tied to intelligence agencies,]{.mark}]{.underline}** the most
secretive parts of any government (Smeets 2018). Until recently, their
public engagement was minimal. For example, the acronym of the U.S.
National Security Agency (NSA) has been commonly referred to as 'No Such
Agency.' The bureaucratic culture of these agencies is therefore not
infused with a history of interactions with their respective
counterparts internationally (apart from the norms governing spy swaps
that emerged during the Cold War.) **[Unlike the militaries of the world
that---despite fghting each other---have developed norms for the
exchange of prisoners, the treatment of the wounded, and other activity,
this sort of interaction is not part of intelligence
agencies']{.underline}** DNA.28 With that said, the pace of change
afecting intelligence agencies in the past 5 years alone is breathtaking
with potential changing attitudes toward such interactions. For example,
from the NSA to the Australian signals directorate, agencies now even
have active Twitter accounts and terms such as Five Eyes have become
household names (Australian Signals Directorate 2018).

### Cyber Ans: Norms Fail---2NC

#### Existing norms prove -- even if we make them nobody will agree on interpretation

Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms," HAGUE JOURNAL ON

**[[There is severe confusion about cyber norms]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
It is not uncommon to encounter statements from diplomats implying that
**[[norms,]{.mark} per defnition, [are voluntary in
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}** and never legally binding---in
contradiction to the decades-old academic literature of sociology and
international relations theory.3 **[[What is to blame]{.mark} for the
confusion? Politics and [the gap between academics and
practitioners]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, this confusion also refects
an undercurrent of competing political systems that afects the
terminology used in this area. **[It is therefore worth briefy unpacking
what (cyber) norms are and how to defne them given the implications for
contestation. [One of the key points of confusion centers on the
relationship between norms and laws]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In academia,
scholars debate whether legal norms enjoy a special status compared to
norms generally.4 Finnemore argues they do not because "There are, after
all, many kinds of norms in the world---social, cultural, professional,
moral, religious, and familial" (Finnemore 1999: 701).5 Others argue
that norms tied to law stand out because of the level of compliance
given rise to concepts such as 'soft law' and 'hard law' (Abbott and
Snidal 2000; see Jose (2018): 25). More recently, Finnemore and Holllis
concluded that "Simply put, laws can serve as a basis for formulating
norms, just as norms can be codifed in law" (Finnemore and Hollis 2016:
442)".6 In international politics, the concept of 'voluntary norms'
emerged as a political strategy developed by the U.S. Department of
State in juxtaposition to Russia's proposal for a legally binding arms
control treaty on information security. Moscow approached Washington
with this idea in the late 1990s which the U.S. government opposed for
several reasons. One of the key decision-makers involved, Richard
Clarke, "viewed the Russian proposal as largely a propaganda tool" in
addition to considering verifcation of a cyber agreement "impossible"
and that "the U.S. had not yet explored what it wanted to do in the area
of cyber war. It was not obvious then whether or not cyber war added to
or subtracted from U.S. national security (Clarke and Knake 2011: 219)".
Other factors that have come up since are the quickly evolving nature of
the technology challenging the longevity of a potential international
treaty and growing concerns that the broad defnition of 'information
security' advanced by Moscow and Beijing is a Trojan horse for content
control and a human rights issue at heart. Another is the difculty of
attributing malicious cyber activity and the related ability to hold
actors responsible (Rid and Buchanan 2015; Lindsay 2015; Brantly et al.
2016; Eglof and Wenger 2019). **[After the [U.S. decided to reject the
Russian proposal]{.mark}, it was in search for a strategy to advance its
own agenda]{.underline}** while still engaging with the Russians when
the issue rose in prominence, namely after the 2007 DDoS attack against
Estonia and the 2008 compromise of the classifed networks of the U.S.
Department of Defense.7 **[Principally opposed to a legally binding
agreement as a goal, the U.S. government came up with the idea for the
international community to develop 'voluntary norms']{.underline}** in
addition to arguing that existing international law applies to
cyberspace. **[[The 2015 UNGGE report therefore]{.mark} repeatedly
[highlights the "voluntary, non-binding" nature of the norms]{.mark} it
outlines for cyberspace]{.underline}** (UN Group of Governmental Experts
2015). **[[The process]{.mark} that emerged out of these early days [has
since been scrutinized]{.mark}, including its dynamics and
actors,]{.underline}** by several scholars (Kavanagh and Staufacher
2014; Hurwitz 2014; Cornish 2015; Farrell 2015; Erskine and Carr 2016;
Tikk-Ringas 2016; Macák 2017; Hurel and Lobato 2018). Ultimately,
**[[these factors explain the confusion and highlight the need to pay
close attention what actors mean when they use the term
'norm.']{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### No Cnorms---fragmentation of opinions and global power conflict means that there's no consensus

**[Maurer '19]{.underline}** \[Tim Maurer, Co-Director, Cyber Policy
Initiative, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "A Dose of
Realism: The Contestation and Politics of Cyber Norms," HAGUE JOURNAL ON
THE RULE OF LAW, 2019, SpringerLink.

In 2017, the **[same year that the [two biggest cyber attacks]{.mark} to
date]{.underline}**---WannaCry and NotPetya---occurred, international
negotiations over norms for cyberspace collapsed. With each attack
**[[causing several billions]{.mark} of U.S. dollars [in economic
damage]{.mark} worldwide]{.underline}**, **[the cyber attacks raise the
question]{.underline}**: **[[why did the]{.mark} [international
community]{.mark}]{.underline}** through the UN Group of Governmental
Experts (UNGGE1 ) **[[fail to reach a consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}**
on how to advance the emerging regime of norms for cyberspace? On the
surface, **[[states]{.mark} such as the US, Cuba and India [argue
that]{.mark} [it was a disagreement]{.mark} over international
law]{.underline}** (Markof 2017; Rodriguez 2017; Sukumar 2017). **[Yet,
[the iceberg]{.mark} underneath [is a mix of great power
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} competing and occasionally
clashing political systems, and continued uncertainty with respect to a
new technology.

**[Overall, states' approach to [norms for cyberspace remains highly
contested]{.mark} internationally among governments and fragmented
domestically within governments. [Cyber norms are still in their
"constituting phase]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Wiener 2014). Agreed upon,
explicitly stated norms are considered voluntary, defned vaguely, and
internalized weakly (Farrell and Glaser 2017: 16). **[Implicit state
[practice is]{.mark} slowly emerging, [yet poorly understood, and
cloaked in secrecy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, the diplomatic
activities over the past two decades have shaped signifcantly how
governments think about cyber norms and how they behave accordingly (Nye
2018).

To understand the dynamics of the international cyber norms
contestation, various lenses can be applied. In addition to signs of the
security dilemma impacting states' behavior (Buchanan 2017), competing
conceptual approaches and key terms explain this outcome. These include
key concepts such as 'norms' (Finnemore and Hollis 2016), 'deterrence'
(White House 2018a), even 'information security' and 'cyber security'
(Maurer and Morgus 2014), **[with new concepts]{.underline}** such as
'persistent engagement' (Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018)
**[complementing the mix.]{.underline}** **[Each of them is associated
with a specifc bureaucratic agency]{.underline}** advancing its own
agenda. Even the behavior of individual actors is worth mentioning as
the two key diplomats in the U.S. and Russia leading these negotiations
have not changed in the last 20 years achieving unusual infuence setting
the agenda, strategies, and pace of the discussions since the process
began.2

Why norms fail **[The literature and conferences on norms have generated
a kind of self-referential momentum based on this premise, and yet,
[cyber-conflict among states is as intense as
ever.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While it's true that there are not a lot of
alternative governance mechanisms available, the idea that norm
development helps avoid conflict is something that needs to put to the
test, empirically and logically. Let's first make a brief general
argument about the limitations of norms and then turn to specific
evidentiary exhibits. To respond to Eichensehr's bullet points: Of
course norms are easier to develop and agree on than treaties. As
general principles with no binding force, it is easy for states to
formulate generalities that sound nice and agree to them without any
credible commitment. Does this accomplish anything? **[The fact that
[norms can]{.mark} develop [through]{.mark} unilateral
declarations]{.underline}**, **[bilateral agreements]{.underline}**,
**[or [groups of states]{.mark} indicates that they [still leave us in a
state of anarchy, with multiple actors telling others what they
think]{.mark} states should do and plenty of room for maneuvering around
constraints states don't like.]{.underline}** But **[[with]{.mark}
dozens of different and possibly [conflicting norms
]{.mark}]{.underline}**flying around, how can the discourse have any
impact on what states actually do? True, cyber norms can -- and should
-- evolve through state practice, but again that means that **[we don't
really have rules that shape behavior, we just have an open-ended
normative discourse]{.underline}**. That states will alter their
normative positions as facts on the ground evolve, based on their own
interests, is a realistic/positivistic description of what will in fact
happen, it is not a normative prescription that channels behavior in a
certain direction. The claim that conflicting norms "foster valuable
clarity" about states' actions is not always true. The parties engaged
in a normative discourse -- **[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}** --
**[[are]{.mark} known to be [secretive, deceptive,]{.mark} frequently
[hypocritical, and]{.mark} likely to [defect
when]{.mark}]{.underline}**ever **[[it serves their
interest.]{.underline}]{.mark}** But **[even when states honestly
formulate and promote their conflicting norms, we are still in a state
of anarchy]{.underline}**. And usually their actions are clearer than
their words. Two recent incidents of **[[cyber]{.mark} conflict provide
support for these jaundiced conclusions]{.underline}**: **[they show
that [norm development cannot overcome basic conflicts of
interest]{.mark} among rival powers, and that states advancing specific
norms repeatedly violate them]{.underline}**.

The Necessity of an International Cyberwar Convention This section
presents the case for negotiating an international convention to govern
cyber conflict between states. **[Despite growing threats from actors
using ICT for aggressive and illicit purposes, few treaties address
international cyber security issues]{.underline}**. Presently, the main
international agreements governing cyber conduct are the 2001 Convention
on Cybercrime (and its Additional Protocol, 2006) and the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization's International Information Security Agreement
(2009) (Vihul & Schmitt 2016, 39--40). Both agreements are severely
limited, however, in terms of both their scope and membership.Footnote17
**[Calls for negotiating a comprehensive international treaty to govern
cyber conflict---a so-called E-neva Convention---have so far met with
disapproval]{.underline}**, especially from Western states
(ibid.)Footnote18 To date, the most elaborate discussions of cyber
governance have thus focused on bringing existing international law to
bear on cyber conflict. **[The *[Tallinn Manual]{.mark}*]{.underline}**
*on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare* (2013) **[is the
most widely cited outcome of such discussions. This manual
[formulates]{.mark} a set of rules [for]{.mark} how existing
international law---chiefly *jus ad bellum*]{.underline}**,
international humanitarian law **[[(IHL)]{.mark} and laws of state
responsibility---apply in a cyber context]{.underline}** (Talinn Manual
2013; Schmitt and Vihul 2014a, b, 2016; Lucas 2016). **[[But]{.mark}
while the Tallinn Manual]{.underline}** (hereafter "the Manual")
**[provides a useful starting point for focusing attention on the need
for stronger international cyber-governance, [its practical
value]{.mark} as an instrument [to restrain]{.mark} cyber conflict [is
modest]{.mark} for (at least) three reasons.
[First]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Lucas points out (2017, 40), **[the
Manual has generally [failed to gain support outside]{.mark} the narrow
group of [NATO]{.mark} member-states that sponsored it. [Second,
the]{.mark} Manual does not propose or promulgate new international
rules for the cyber domain but merely offers an [interp]{.mark}retation
of how existing laws may apply. So far, this interpretation has largely
[failed to persuade states to restrain]{.mark} their activities in the
cyber domain]{.underline}** (Lucas 2017, 17). **[What is more, the
[interp]{.mark}retation [of many]{.mark} *jus ad bellum* and *jus in
bello* treaty [provisions]{.mark} as applied to cyber conflict [remain
unsettled]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Schmitt and Vihul 2016, 43).
**[[Anticipating]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as some of the leading legal
scholars behind the Manual do, **[that "interpretative [dilemmas]{.mark}
concerning treaty law [will]{.mark} be [resolve]{.mark}d
[through]{.mark} the recurrent [practice]{.mark} of states in their
application"]{.underline}** (Ibid., 43--44) **[[seems
optimistic]{.mark}, especially when considering that the interpretation
offered in the Manual has so far failed to influence state practice or
opinio juris]{.underline}**. Third, even if states were to agree on the
general applicability of jus ad bellum and IHL in the cyber domain
(which presently they do not), such agreement would hardly suffice. Each
one of the international treaties and conventions currently governing
the production, stockpiling, sale, transfer, and use of specific classes
of armaments is testament to the states' recognition that the general
international prohibition on the use of force and IHL are by themselves
insufficient to prevent or restrain international armed conflict.

Conclusion

Amid deep conflict over basic norms, Egypt and the GCC states have
maneuvered between two poles while enjoying the tacit, if not explicit,
support of both sides. This has three key implications. First, global
cyber norms are much more complex --- and much more entangled with
traditional governance practices, diplomatic relationships, and
strategic concerns --- than Western officials may like to admit. However
uncomfortable it may be, **[international policymaking on cyber norms
must take into account]{.underline}** not only the "likemindedness" of
some states, but also **[the fact of]{.underline}** their **[strategic
interests]{.underline}** and relationships **[with]{.underline}** other
**[[states]{.mark} that [are]{.mark}]{.underline}** less or
**[[not]{.mark} at all [likeminded]{.mark}. Without this recognition,
[any attempt to create]{.mark} global [cyber norms is hampered]{.mark}
from the start]{.underline}**. More broadly, **[to understand the
complexity of cyber norms we must look outside the framework of great
power competition]{.underline}**.

Second, the United States and European allies of Egypt and the Gulf
states need to decide where their priorities lie: **[[Does
consistency]{.mark} on global cyber norms [outweigh]{.mark} broader
[security considerations?]{.mark}]{.underline}** If a stable, coherent
set of cyber norms is the primary aim, greater attention should be given
to persuading friendly states to stay within the boundaries of these
norms. However, if **[[security]{.mark} alliances [trump cyber
norms]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Western democracies should recognize that
**[the [rhetorical effect of denouncing Russia]{.mark}n or Chinese
action [will be limited]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For the United States,
effective foreign policy regarding cyber security in the Middle East
requires both the identification of a clear national interest, connected
to broader strategic goals concerning the kind of cyber space the United
States seeks to promote, and a good understanding of the evolving
landscape in which the U.S. government and U.S. companies are operating.
Right now, both are lacking.

Third, although the contradictions outlined here suggest that human
rights and national security are important starting points for research,
we should not confine cyber security research on these states to these
well-trodden paths. In the Middle East, cyber security is changing
regional alliances, altering the economic calculations of businesses,
and reforging fundamental relationships between individuals and their
governments. **[[There are significant differences in]{.mark} cyber
security [approaches between]{.mark}]{.underline}** these
**[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially in Kuwait and Qatar. And
there are many new initiatives and organizations, like Saudi Arabia's
National Cyber Security Authority (al-hai'a al-watniyya lil-'amn
al-sibrani), Egypt's High Council for Cybersecurity, the UAE's National
Electronic Security Agency, and Oman's Arab Region Cybersecurity Centre.
As our understanding of cyber security evolves and its connection to
other areas of foreign policy deepens, a broader approach to cyber
security research in this region is urgently needed to adequately
understand these new dynamics and inform future policy choices.

### Cyber Ans: Nuclear Escalation

#### [Air-gapping]{.underline} solves nuclear escalation.

Challenges for Nuclear Security and Arms Control", European Security,

**[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark}** of course **[[highly unlikely]{.mark}
that [either]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}A [or Russia has plans -- or]{.mark}
perhaps more importantly, the [desire -- to]{.mark}]{.underline}** fully
**[[undermine]{.mark} the [other's]{.mark} nuclear
[c]{.mark}]{.underline}**ommand **[[and c]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontrol
**[systems]{.underline}** as a precursor to some type of disarming first
strike, but the perception that nuclear forces and associated systems
could be vulnerable or compromised is persuasive. Or as Hayes (2015)
puts it, "The risks of cyber disablement entering into our nuclear
forces are real". While **[the [growing possibility]{.mark} of
"[cyber]{.mark} disablement" [should not be overstated (notions of
a]{.mark} "cyber-[Pearl Harbor]{.mark}"]{.underline}** (Panetta 2012)
**[or "cyber 9--11"]{.underline}** (Charles 2013) **[[have done little
to help understand]{.mark} the nature of the challenge]{.underline}**),
cyberthreats are nevertheless an increasingly important component of the
contemporary US--Russia strategic context. This is particularly the case
when they are combined with other emerging military-technical
developments and programmes. The net result, especially given the
current downturn in US--Russian strategic relations, and the way cyber
is exacerbating the impact of other problematic strategic dynamics, is
that is seems highly unlikely that either the USA or Russia will make
the requisite moves to de-alert nuclear forces that the new cyber
challenges appear to necessitate, or for that matter to (re)embrace the
"deep nuclear cuts" agenda any time soon. Assessing the options for arms
control and enhancing mutual security Given the new challenges presented
by cyber to both US and Russian nuclear forces and to US--Russia
strategic stability, it is important to consider what might be done to
help mitigate and guard against these threats, and thereby help minimise
the risks of unintentional launches, miscalculation, and accidents, and
perhaps create the conditions for greater stability, de-alerting, and
further nuclear cuts. While there is unlikely to be a panacea or "magic
bullet" that will reduce the risk of cyberattacks on US and Russian
nuclear forces to zero -- be they designed to launch nuclear weapons or
compromise the systems that support them -- there are a number of
options that might be considered and pursued in order to address these
different types of threats and vulnerabilities. None, of these however,
will be easy. The most obvious and immediate priority for both the USA
and Russia is working (potentially together) to harden and better
protect nuclear systems against possible cyberattack, intrusion, or
cyber-induced accidents. In fact, in October 2013 it was announced that
Russian nuclear command and control networks would be protected against
cyber incursion and attacks by "special units" of the Strategic Missile
Forces (Russia Today 2014). Other measures will include better network
defences and firewalls, more sophisticated cryptographic codes, upgraded
and better protected communications systems (including cables), extra
redundancy, and better training and screening for the practitioners that
operate these systems (see Ullman 2015). However, and while
comprehensive reviews are underway to assess the vulnerabilities of
current US and Russian nuclear systems to cyberattacks, it may well be
that US and Russian C2 infrastructure becomes more vulnerable to cyber
as it is modernised and old analogue systems are replaced with
increasingly hi-tech digital platforms. As a result, and while
**[[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [and c]{.mark}ommand [and c]{.mark}ontrol
[infrastructure are]{.mark} likely to be [the best protected of
all]{.mark} computer systems, [and "air gapped"]{.mark}]{.underline}**14
**[[from the]{.mark} wider [Internet]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- this does
not mean they are invulnerable or will continue to be secure in the
future, particularly as systems are modernised or become more complex
(Fritz 2009). Or as Peggy Morse, ICBM systems director at Boeing, put
it, "while its old it's very secure" (quoted in Reed 2012).

**[[No]{.mark}, the [US Won't Respond to]{.mark} A [Cyber]{.mark} Attack
[with Nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Defense leaders won't completely rule out the possibility. **[But it's a
very, very, very remote possibility]{.underline}**.

**[The idea that the U.S. is building]{.underline}** new **[low-yield
nuclear weapons to respond to a cyber attack is "not
true,"]{.underline}** military leaders told reporters in the runup to
the Friday release of the new Nuclear Posture Review.

"The people who say we lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear
weapons are saying, 'but we want these low-yield nuclear weapons so that
we can answer a cyber attack because we're so bad at cyber security.'
That's just fundamentally not true," Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of
the Joints Chiefs of Staff, said Tuesday at a meeting with reporters.

**[It's [an idea]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[military
[leaders]{.mark} have been [push]{.mark}ing [back against]{.mark} since
the New York Times ran a]{.underline}** Jan. 16 **[story headlined,
"Pentagon Suggests Countering Devastating Cyberattacks With Nuclear
Arms."]{.underline}**

When would the U.S. launch a nuclear attack in response to a non-nuclear
event? The Defense Department says **[[the threshold hasn't
changed]{.mark} since]{.underline}** the **[Obama]{.underline}**
administration's own nuclear posture review in 2010, but a draft of the
new review that leaked online caused a bit of drama in its attempts to
dispel "ambiguity."

The new review gives examples of "non-nuclear strategic attacks," Robert
Soofer, deputy assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense
policy, told reporters on Thursday. "It could be catastrophic attacks
against civilian populations, against infrastructure. It could be an
attack using a non-nuclear weapon against our nuclear
command-and-control \[or\] early-warning satellites. But **[[we don't
talk about cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

In his own conversation with reporters, Selva broadened "early warning"
systems to include ones that provide "indications of warning that are
important to our detection of an attack." He also emphasized, "We never
said 'cyber.'"

**[There's [a reason]{.mark} for that]{.underline}**. While
**[[cyber]{.mark} attacks]{.underline}** on physical infrastructure can
be very dangerous, they **[[are unlikely to kill enough]{.mark} people
[to provoke a]{.mark} U.S. [nuclear response]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

An National Academies of Science and Engineering analysis of the
vulnerability of U.S. infrastructure makes that point.
**[A]{.underline}** major **[cyber attack could cut off electrical
power]{.underline}**, resulting in "people dying from heat or cold
exposure, etc.," said Granger Morgan, co-director of the Carnegie Mellon
Electricity Industry Center and one of the chairs of the report. "A
large outage of long duration could cover many states and last for weeks
or longer. Whether and how many casualties there could be would depend
on things like what the weather was during the outage."

**[It's]{.underline}** a huge problem but **[[not]{.mark} an event
[resulting in tens of thousands of]{.mark} immediate
[deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Contrast that with a nuclear attack on a city like Moscow, even one
using a device of 6 kilotons, much smaller than the ones the United
States used against Japanese targets in World War II. The immediate
result: there would be 40,000 deaths, according to the online nuclear
simulation tool NukeMap.

**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** has **[demonstrated]{.underline}** a
**[willingness]{.underline}** to take down power services with cyber
attacks, as they did in Ukraine on Christmas Eve 2015.
**[But]{.underline}** these **[[attacks were brief and occured
in]{.mark} the context of [actual fighting]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

In other words, **[the [worst]{.mark}]{.underline}** cyber physical
**[[attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[top [experts believe
credible]{.mark} likely [does not meet the threshold]{.mark} that the
[Defense]{.mark} Department [has]{.mark} set out [for]{.mark} deploying
[a nuc]{.mark}lear weapon]{.underline}**.

Our meetings with senior NATO policy-makers underlined that a new era of
conflict has begun. We learned **[[NATO is]{.mark} making a strong
effort to collect and evaluate information about hybrid attacks directed
against its member states]{.underline}**. **[It is also [developing
rapid-reaction cyber-defence teams]{.mark} that can be sent at an ally's
request in a crisis]{.underline}**. **[The cyber teams work on civil
emergency planning, critical infrastructure protection, counterterrorism
and energy protection]{.underline}**. **[[This is an inexpensive way to
respond to threats below the threshold of Article
5]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- the collective defence obligation enshrined
in the 1949 Washington Treaty at the founding of NATO. But **[could a
hybrid attack trigger Article 5]{.underline}**? Diplomats rather
implausibly asserted **[[NATO's response would be context-driven]{.mark}
based on decisions rapidly arrived at by all the allies by
consensus]{.underline}**. Hackers operating at the sub-state level could
be difficult to name and shame. Attribution difficulties would also
prevent discovering their motives. [**[NATO wants to prevent conflicts

[more units are being dedicated to deal with hybrid
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as the European Centre of
Excellence established by Finland. But all this work requires the
sharing of confidential information and classified documents, which
means significant trust must be built. Yet much of **[the burden will be
on individual NATO member states to develop sufficient resilience to
counter cyber attacks]{.underline}**. **[All allies will need to improve
their resilience]{.underline}**, **[and [NATO is producing benchmark
guidelines]{.mark} to facilitate an alliance-wide common

them against low-level hazards, but they will likely be told they should
learn to cope with those on their own. **[NATO is working to defend

#### NATO cannot act cohesively---multiple reasons

**[Lucas, CEPA fellow, '22]{.underline}**

accessed 6-10-22\]\\

Yet look a little more closely, and **[[the picture is far less rosy.
Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since the start of
Russia's war, NATO looks out of shape and out of
date]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the run-up to their summit, the
**[[allies have been furiously haggling]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the
language in their new strategic concept, which will frame the alliance's
mission for the coming years and will be unveiled in Madrid. What will
it say about Russia? About China? What sacrifices and risks are the
member states really willing to accept? Are they willing to pool
sovereignty in order to streamline decision-making?

**[[Nothing in recent weeks suggests that these questions will get clear
answers. For starters, the 30-strong alliance is
unwieldy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In military terms, **[[only a handful
of members]{.underline}]{.mark}** matter---above all, the United
States---but in political terms, even little Luxembourg and Iceland get
a voice. Worse, **[[the political divides are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
huge. Turkey under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is a
semi-authoritarian state that flirts with Russia and fumes at what it
considers European meddling over human rights. Hungary under Prime
Minister Viktor Orban is taking a different but downward path, fusing
wealth and power into a new system of control at home and undermining
U.S. and European attempts to put pressure on Russia and China. Macron's
relentless posturing and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's foot-dragging
create constant obstacles and distractions. The two leader's weaknesses,
on glorious display since the start of the war, have already enriched
the language: Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while
makronic in Polish (and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly
translated as "vacuous grandstanding while doing nothing."

**[[Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their
foibles]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[and thus place a big question mark
over the alliance's credibility and cohesion.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Any
threat or provocation from Russia is unlikely to be clear or
conveniently timed. More likely it will be something deliberately
ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that "accidentally" strays onto the
territory of a front-line state and hits a target. Some countries would
favor a tough response. Others would fear escalation and want dialogue.
Still others would take the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do
nothing. **[[Would the 30]{.underline}]{.mark}**---soon to be
32---**[[national representatives in the North Atlantic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the alliance's deliberative body,
**[[really make a speedy and tough decision on how to
react]{.underline}]{.mark}**? More likely, **[[some of them would plead
for delay, diplomacy, and compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Those
actually facing the possibility of attack would be far more hawkish,
preferring a sharp military confrontation to even the smallest Russian
victory. "Not one inch, not one soul," a senior military figure from one
of the Baltic states, speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what
they did in Ukraine."

Effects on Alliance Cohesion Another trend that **[the
[corona]{.mark}virus]{.underline}** may **[[accelerate]{.mark} is the
[loss of]{.mark} intra-[alliance cohesion]{.mark} and
solidarity]{.underline}**. Just prior to the eruption of the COVID-19
pandemic in the West, the Pew Research Trust released its latest
findings (February 2020) on how NATO is viewed by the publics of the
alliance members. Their research concluded: **[There is widespread
reluctance to fulfill]{.underline}** the collective defense commitment
outlined in **[Article 5]{.underline}** of NATO's founding treaty. When
asked if their country should defend a fellow NATO ally against a
potential attack from Russia, **[a median of [50%]{.mark} across 16 NATO
member states [say their country should not defend an
ally]{.mark}]{.underline}**, compared with 38% who say their country
should defend an ally against a Russian attack. Intra-alliance cohesion
was further shaken by the Idlib crisis---when it appeared that Turkey's
NATO allies were not fully on board with giving Ankara the blank check
it requested to confront Russia in Syria---and by Turkey's subsequent
decision to again permit migrants and refugees to transit Turkish
territory in order to be able to reach the European Union. Turkey's
perspective, of course, is that since it is not an EU member, it should
not have to necessarily carry water for European states. From a security
perspective, one member of NATO was choosing not to prevent, but even to
encourage, a trend that threatened the security of its ostensible
allies. To be sure, **[the coronavirus]{.underline}** did not create
this situation, but it further **[erodes confidence in the proclamations
of solidarity]{.underline}** that ritually end every NATO summit. In the
past month, as the virus spreads throughout the world, **[[NATO]{.mark}
(and EU) allies [have seen]{.mark} their [partners hoarding]{.mark}
equipment and [medical supplies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Moreover,
**[intra-alliance [borders]{.mark} have been [closed]{.mark}
down[,]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only between NATO and EU members
within Europe, but also bans forbidding travel across the Atlantic have
been enacted. The perception that the **[United States is prepared to go
it alone]{.underline}** and look out for its well-being **[without
concern for its closest allies]{.underline}** reinforces pre-existing
trends; Europeans, in turn, believe that their side of the Atlantic must
be prepared to de-couple from Washington for its own security---and the
messages they are receiving from the United States over coronavirus adds
further grist to that mill. Meanwhile, **[Beijing has reaped a public
relations bonanza]{.underline}** from its moves to send assistance to
virus-ravaged Italy and Spain, which has highlighted the initial lack of
concrete support from Rome's and Madrid's Western partners. While the
European Union has taken the brunt of the criticism, the United States
has not used NATO as a way to develop a coalition to combat the virus.
**[NATO ally Turkey had used indecision over Syria to justify its
willingness to buck NATO solidarity to forge a closer relationship with
Russia]{.underline}**; now, **[Italy feels justified in closer
collaboration with Beijing]{.underline}**, including on the Belt and
Road Initiative, because of the perception that Western solidarity has
failed Rome in its time of need. Beyond the political perception that
NATO has failed the solidarity test, **[the practical realities of the
pandemic call into question the operational basis of NATO's deterrent
mission:]{.underline}** the ability to field forces in sufficient
strength to deter or repel any possible incursion. If one result of the
pandemic has been a push for countries to withdraw their national
contingents from overseas missions to concentrate on the home front,
then a second is a growing reluctance for countries to send---or
receive---forces for fear that they will spread the disease. **[Norway
canceled the regional "Cold Defender" exercise]{.underline}** that
should have been held in March 2020 over concerns for troops coming into
Norway, and other countries, such as Finland, were reluctant to dispatch
their forces. **[[The major Europe-wide]{.mark} NATO [exercise]{.mark}
for 2020]{.underline}**, "European Defender," **[which was designed, in
part, to demonstrate to outside adversaries (read: Russia) that the
United States could quickly reinforce the continent, is being [scaled
back]{.mark}]{.underline}**, amidst a new Department of Defense
directive that has halted the movement of U.S. forces and equipment. The
Russia Factor **[Signs of discord in NATO are always carefully monitored
by Russia]{.underline}**. The 2015 Russian national security strategy
categorizes the alliance as a threat to Russian strategic interests,
even if some of its member (like Germany, France, Italy, Turkey, and
Hungary) are, at a bilateral level, important strategic partners. It is
not surprising, therefore, that the Kremlin, even if it has not
explicitly commissioned a disinformation campaign, sees value in having
its news and information outlets push narratives that seek to accelerate
discord and disunity among NATO members. Depending on the course of the
pandemic, **[we could very easily see a new Russian information
campaign]{.underline}**. Such a campaign would target publics in
southern and western Europe and **[would question the value of an
alliance which was ineffective in its response to the virus but which
demands that they be prepared to risk conflict with
Russia]{.underline}**---while also sowing more doubts in both NATO and
non-NATO neighbors about how much faith they are willing to place in
alliance guarantees. The Russian decision to dispatch military medical
specialists and equipment to Italy is also being contrasted with the
initially lackluster EU/NATO response. **[Better
messaging]{.underline}**, however, **[is not going to be a
sufficient]{.underline}** response. Nor should NATO assume that once
this crisis has passed, it will be a return to business as usual. For
one thing, **[there could be recurrent flare-ups of
[COVID]{.mark}-19]{.underline}**, leading to the re-imposition of travel
bans, border closures, and movement of personnel. **[The economic
fallout from the pandemic [is going to impact budgets]{.mark} and
policies [for years]{.mark} to come]{.underline}**.

#### Military structural problems limit alliance effectiveness

accessed 6-10-22\]\\

The **[[political weaknesses are matched by military ones. By far the
most important country in the alliance is the United
States]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The U.S. security guarantee to
Europe---with its threat of devastating conventional and, if necessary,
nuclear response to any attack---is the cornerstone of the alliance.
"All for one and one for all" sounds fine, but nobody in the Kremlin
will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch, or Canadian displeasure.
Yet **[[the result of this is a colossal dependence on U.S.
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, ranging from ammunition and spare
parts (of which European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny)
to military transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over
long distances. **[[Even if Europe's new defense spending plans
materialize, they will not change the fact that only U.S. armed forces
can move with the scale and speed necessary to defend
territory]{.underline}]{.mark}** from a country like Russia.

Conversely, the **[[countries that most need
defending]{.underline}]{.mark}**---Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania---**[[are the least able to bear the
burden]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves. They need advanced weapons,
particularly for air and missile defense, that they cannot afford
themselves. The thin neck of land along the Polish-Lithuanian border,
the so-called Suwalki Gap, is particularly vulnerable to attack from
Russia's militarized Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, from which Russia
attacked Ukraine. Poland and Lithuania both want a big U.S. military
presence---either a permanent base or a persistent rotation of
forces---to safeguard this strategic chokepoint.

Yet **[[NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces]{.underline}]{.mark}** between the United States and
Europe. **[[They rely on the fiction that the European allies are more
or less equal partners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even military
lightweights need to have important-sounding jobs and installations,
making the North Atlantic Council the military version of a parliament
dividing out the pork.

**[[The resulting command structure is like a tangled pile of
spaghetti.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In the Baltic region alone, NATO has
several multinational headquarters, one divisional headquarters split
between Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in Poland,
and a corps headquarters at a different location in Poland. Overall
responsibility for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint
Forces Command headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands;
and Norfolk, Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe,
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea
region has yet to be decided---which is just as well, because NATO has
yet to create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance
drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and defense of its
northeastern members, let alone decided who would actually provide the
forces and equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility
is meant to be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy.

**[[Expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[inflames anti-NATO
sentiment by]{.mark} feeding skepticism about its
benefits.]{.underline}** One of the strongest arguments for the alliance
is that **[it is better to have lots of rich, powerful allies when

this]{.underline}** argument**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Thus, President
**[Trump]{.underline}** has regularly **[criticized NATO as a "bad
deal"]{.underline}** for the United States **[while]{.underline}**
French President Emmanuel **[Macron]{.underline}** has **[called NATO
"brain-dead."]{.underline}** Finally, **[expansion incorporates
countries with short and shallow democratic traditions.]{.underline}**
**[North Macedonia, like the [newly added]{.mark} NATO
[countries]{.mark} of Croatia, Montenegro, and Albania]{.underline}**,
has made great strides in improving governance, for which they all
deserve credit, but they **[[lack]{.mark} the [robust
institutions]{.mark} that justify military burdens to NATO publics.
Someday this [over-expansion will produce a
crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Perhaps **[the crisis will arise
[from]{.mark} an [intra-NATO dispute]{.mark}; perhaps [from]{.mark} a
local dispute that involves, for example, [long-standing
tensions]{.mark} between Serbia and its NATO neighbors Croatia or North
Macedonia; or]{.underline}** perhaps the **[treatment of an ethnic
minority like Russians in the Baltic countries. If dragged
in]{.underline}**to **[messy conflicts in which they have few interests,
[countries may]{.mark}]{.underline}** come to **[[openly question the
entire]{.mark} NATO [project]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[and
endanger]{.mark} a key element of [European]{.mark}, indeed, global
[stability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[NATO needs to draw the line now.

partners]{.mark} who might also want to join NATO]{.underline}**. And
who can blame them. By joining NATO they gain security and status at
little cost.

**[[A related problem is]{.mark} the [tendency of]{.mark} some [allies

threats and defence capability development). Linda Slapakova. 1/15/20,
"What International Relations Theory can tell us about NATO's 'Mort
Cérébrale',"
<https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/15/01/2020/what-international-relations-theory-can-tell-us-about-natos-mort-cerebrale>

In the prelude to the NATO summit in London commemorating the 70th
anniversary of the founding of the alliance, discussions were
overshadowed by a now-infamous Economist interview with French President
Emmanuel **[Macron]{.underline}**. In the interview, the French
President **[claimed]{.underline}** that **[NATO is experiencing a
"brain death]{.underline}**" -- a 'mort cérébrale' resulting
**[from]{.underline}** a **[lack of institutional capacity to
prevent]{.underline}**, mitigate, or effectively respond to
**[unilateral action from individual allies which could be disruptive to
the alliance's agenda]{.underline}**. President Macron's remarks
precipitated a debate concerning NATO's relevance (or irrelevance) in
the post-Cold War international system, its (potentially failing)
adaptation to new security and strategic circumstances, and the
constraints imposed by NATO's seeming lack of institutionalisation and
ability to prevent unilateral action taken by individual members.
Although NATO does not feature frequently in International Relations
(IR) theory, and IR debates are more often than not virtually absent
from NATO scholarship, this article draws on existing literature to
examine the extent to which IR can shed light on the debate over NATO's
alleged 'mort cérébrale'. In doing so, the article argues that **[in
spite of its self-induced crises of confidence, and]{.underline}**
despite important weaknesses and **[challenges, insights from IR
scholarship suggest]{.underline}** that news of **[[NATO's demise
are]{.mark} greatly [exaggerated.]{.mark}]{.underline}** NATO's
adaptation in the post-cold war international system In the days and
weeks following President Macron's remarks, the question of NATO's
irrelevance and potential demise dominated debates, with less attention
being paid to the issue which Macron's comment was actually directed at,
namely Turkey's offensive into Syria and the US' sanctioning of this
move; both of which occurred without prior discussion or consent of
other NATO allies. While the escalatory nature of the debate may seem
surprising to some, it represents more of a rule than an exception. It
is symptomatic of the overall state of debate about NATO in the
post-Cold War era: **[[NATO is, seemingly, constantly on the brink of
collapse.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As commentators have attempted to come
to grips with any given crisis, **[a 'NATO-in-crisis' body of literature
has developed. This]{.underline}** literature **[claims]{.underline}**
that "**[disputes]{.underline}** within the Alliance **[grow more
debilitating over time]{.underline}**, in the sense that
**[[each]{.mark} new [crisis]{.mark} is promptly labelled [the worst
ever.]{.mark}]{.underline}**" **[[However, none]{.mark} of the
predictions of NATO's collapse have [materialised]{.mark}]{.underline}**
thus far**[[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** According to IR theorists, several
factors contribute to this endurance of the North Atlantic alliance.
**[The first factor is the value of established
institutions]{.underline}** **[in]{.underline}** **[promoting stability
and enabling cooperation]{.underline}** between states in the
international system. **[[Institutions are]{.underline}]{.mark}**
generally **[[costly to maintain]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and existing
institutions may be less than optimally efficient,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** such **[costs often [pale in comparison
to]{.mark} the costs of [unilateral action or]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
upfront costs of **[creating of [new
institutions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While this is the general rule, a
number of factors determine the weight of those relative costs,
including the availability of institutional assets in the form of norms,
rules, and procedures. In the case of NATO these assets have developed
to be sufficiently hybrid to allow for post-Cold War adaptation to new
security and strategic challenges after the Soviet threat -- NATO's
raison d'être -- disappeared. In this sense, **[although NATO may be
perceived as originally tasked with an explicit mandate to provide
territorial defence and deterrence against the Soviet threat, the nature
of its [institutional assets create incentives for]{.mark} member
[states to adapt]{.mark} the institution [to a new security]{.mark} and
strategic [environment]{.mark} rather than facing emerging threats
unilaterally]{.underline}**, or with the help of new organisations.
Secondly, **[members may be]{.underline}** perceived as **[developing a
"vested interest in maintaining existing institutional arrangements"
through]{.underline}** what John Ikenberry describes as
'**[[institutional stickiness']{.underline}]{.mark}**. As an institution
with distinct Western and liberal character, the normative and
ideational aspects of NATO's mandate may be seen as contributing to such
stickiness. **[This [includes]{.mark} NATO's [perceived success as a
security community, as well as]{.mark} its "ability to re-produce 'the
West' as a geo-cultural space]{.underline}** that serves as its security
referent object" in a more discursive sense. **[In spite of the many
criticisms directed at NATO for its insufficiencies]{.underline}** in
the face of existing and emerging threats, **[NATO continues to be seen
[as a]{.mark} crucial [beacon for the]{.mark} Western [l]{.mark}iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder]{.underline}**. In times **[[when
emerging powers]{.mark} are perceived to [pose a threat]{.mark} to such
an order]{.underline}**, it may be argued that **[[NATO's]{.mark}
institutional [stickiness will strengthen]{.mark}, rather than
weaken]{.underline}**, on the basis of its normative character. Thirdly,
scholars have stipulated the central role of institutional change and
adaptation for explaining NATO's resilience. With a significant
evolution in NATO's role and responsibilities in the post-Cold War era,
a **[[crucial]{.underline}]{.mark}** factor
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** understanding **[NATO's [resilience has
been]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[ability]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
NATO allies **[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** negotiate a
**[[balance]{.mark} between]{.underline}** the alliance's roles and
responsibilities, particularly those of **[[collective defence and
out-of-area engagements]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Johnston argues, NATO
adaptation has taken place in the context of various historical events
representing 'critical junctures' for the institution. Analysis of these
critical junctures also reveals the agency of NATO's institutional
actors vis-a-vis member states with the help of instruments such as
agenda-setting, moderating, and co-opting powers. **[Despite the
appearance to the contrary, NATO is more institutionalised than
traditional military alliances]{.underline}**, which helps explain its
post-Cold War adaptation. With or without brain death: NATO is here to
stay **[No doubt, [NATO]{.mark}'s decision-making [will]{.mark} continue
to [be hampered by]{.mark} intra-alliance
[disputes]{.mark}]{.underline}** over highly contentious issues such as
Turkey's recent intervention in Syria. As much as this issue can be
perceived as a crisis for the alliance, **[NATO has faced and survived
such situations before]{.underline}**. In explaining this dynamic, **[IR

situation is not detrimental to the alliance. The effectiveness of
NATO's deterrence function fundamentally hinges on the perception of
unity and commitment towards collective defence. Should member states
choose to act unilaterally and escalate every dispute to a debate over
NATO's very survival, the credibility of the alliance and its deterrent
will undoubtedly suffer as a consequence.

Key Findings: Rethinking the Value of Democracy

**[The value of democracy has been taken for granted]{.underline}**
until recently, but this assumption seems to be under threat now more
than ever before. As was explained in Chapter 1, democracy's claim to be
valuable does not rest on just one particular merit, and scholars tend
to distinguish three different types of values (Sen 1999). This book
focused on the instrumental value of democracy (and hence not on the
intrinsic and constructive value), and investigated the value of
democracy for peace (Chapters 3 and 4), control of corruption (Chapter
5) and economic development (Chapter 6). **[This study was based on a
search of an enormous academic database for certain keywords,6 then
pruned the thousands of articles down to a few hundred articles (see
Appendix) which statistically analysed the connection between the
democracy and the four expected outcomes.]{.underline}**

The frst fiding is that **[[a]{.mark} reverse [wave]{.mark} away [from
democracy has not happened]{.mark}]{.underline}** (see Chapter 2). Not
yet, at least. **[Democracy is not doing worse than before, at least not
in comparative perspective. While it is true that there is a dramatic
decline in democracy in some countries,7 a general trend downwards
cannot yet be detected.]{.underline}** It would be better to talk about
'stagnation', as not many dictatorships have democratized recently,
while democracies have not yet collapsed.

Another fnding is that the instrumental value of democracy is very
questionable. The feld has been deeply polarized between researchers who
endorse a link between democracy and positive outcomes, and those who
reject this optimistic idea and instead emphasize the negative effects
of democracy. **[There has been 'no consensus' in the quantitative
literature on whether democracy has instrumental value which leads some
beneficial general outcomes. Some scholars claim there is a consensus,
but they only do so by ignoring a huge amount of literature which
rejects their own point of view]{.underline}**. After undertaking a
large-scale analysis of carefully selected articles published on the
topic (see Appendix), **[this book can conclude that the connections
between democracy and expected [benefts are]{.mark} not as strong
as]{.underline}** they seem. Hence, we should not overstate the links
between the phenomena.

**[The overall evidence is [weak]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Take the
expected impact of democracy on peace for example. As Chapter 3 showed,
the study of democracy and interstate war has been a fourishing theme in
political science, particularly since the 1970s. However, there are four
reasons why democracy does not cause peace between countries, and why
the empirical support for the popular idea of democratic peace is quite
weak. **[Most statistical [studies have not found a]{.mark} strong
[correlation between]{.mark} democracy and interstate [war]{.mark} at
the dyadic level. They show that [there are]{.mark} other---[more
powerful---explanations]{.mark} for war]{.underline}** and peace, and
even that **[the impact of democracy is a spurious one (caveat 1).
Moreover, the theoretical foundation of the democratic peace hypothesis
is weak, and the causal mechanisms are unclear (caveat 2). In addition,
democracies are not necessarily more peaceful in general, and the
evidence for the democratic peace hypothesis at the monadic level is
inconclusive (caveat 3). Finally, the process of democratization is
dangerous]{.underline}**. Living in a democratizing country means living
in a less peaceful country (caveat 4). With regard to peace between
countries, we cannot defend the idea that democracy has instrumental
value.

**[Can the (instrumental) value of democracy be found in the prevention
of civil war?]{.underline}** Or is the evidence for the opposite idea
more convincing, and does democracy have a 'dark side' which makes civil
war more likely? The findings are confusing, which is exacerbated by the
fact that different aspects of civil war (prevalence, onset, duration
and severity) are mixed up in some civil war studies. Moreover, defining
civil war is a delicate, politically sensitive issue. Determining
whether there is a civil war in a particular country is incredibly
diffcult, while measurements suffer from many weaknesses (caveat 1).
Moreover, **[there is no linear link: [civil wars are just as
unlikely]{.mark} in democracies as in dictatorships]{.underline}**
(caveat 2). Civil war is most likely in times of political change.
**[[Democratization is]{.mark} a very [unpredictable, dangerous]{.mark}
process, increasing the chance of civil war
significantly.]{.underline}** Hybrid systems are at risk as well: the
chance of civil war is much higher compared to other political systems
(caveat 3). More specifcally, both the strength and type of political
institutions matter when explaining civil war. However, **[the type of
political system (e.g. democracy or dictatorship) is not the decisive
factor at all (caveat 4). Finally, democracy has only limited
explanatory power (caveat 5). Economic factors are far more significant
than political factors (such as having a democratic system) when
explaining the onset, duration and severity of civil war. To prevent
civil war, it would make more sense to make poorer countries richer,
instead of promoting democracy. Helping countries to democratize would
even be a very dangerous idea]{.underline}**, as countries with changing
levels of democracy are most vulnerable, making civil wars most likely.
It is true that there is evidence that the chance of civil war decreases
when the extent of democracy increases considerably. The problem however
is that most countries do not go through big political changes but
through small changes instead; those small steps---away or towards more
democracy---are dangerous. Not only is the onset of civil war likely
under such circumstances, but civil wars also tend to be longer, and the
confict is more cruel leading to more victims, destruction and killings
(see Chapter 4).

A more encouraging story can be told around the value for democracy to
control corruption in a country (see Chapter 5). Fighting corruption has
been high on the agenda of international organizations such as the World
Bank and the IMF. Moreover, the theme of corruption has been studied
thoroughly in many different academic disciplines---mainly in economics,
but also in sociology, political science and law. Democracy has often
been suggested as one of the remedies when fghting against high levels
of continuous corruption. So far, the statistical evidence has strongly
supported this idea. As Chapter 5 showed, dozens of studies with broad
quantitative, cross-national and comparative research have found
statistically signifcant associations between (less) democracy and
(more) corruption. However, there are vast problems around
conceptualization (caveat 1) and measurement (caveat 2) of 'corruption'.
Another caveat is that **[democratizing countries are the poorest
performers with regard to controlling corruption]{.underline}** (caveat
3). Moreover, it is not democracy in general, but particular political
institutions which have an impact on the control of corruption; and a
free press also helps a lot in order to limit corruptive practices in a
country (caveat 4). In addition, democracies seem to be less affected by
corruption than dictatorships, but at the same time, there is clear
evidence that economic factors have more explanatory power (caveat 5).
In conclusion, more democracy means less corruption, but we need to be
modest (as other factors matter more) and cautious (as there are many
caveats).

The perceived impact of democracy on development has been highly
contested as well (see Chapter 6). Some scholars argue that democratic
systems have a positive impact, while others argue that high levels of
democracy actually reduce the levels of economic growth and development.
Particularly since the 1990s, statistical studies have focused on this
debate, and **[the empirical evidence is clear: [there is no]{.mark}
direct [impact of democracy on]{.mark} development.]{.underline}**
Hence, both approaches cannot be supported (see caveat 1). The indirect
impact via other factors is also questionable (caveat 2). Moreover,
there is too much variation in levels of **[economic
[growth]{.mark}]{.underline}** and development **[among the dictatorial
systems]{.underline}**, and there are huge regional differences (caveat
3). Adopting a one-size-ftsall approach would not be wise at all. In
addition, in order to increase development, it would be better to focus
on alternative factors such as improving institutional quality and good
governance (caveat 4). There is not suffcient evidence to state that
democracy has instrumental value, at least not with regard to economic
growth. However, future research needs to include broader concepts and
measurements of development in their models, as so far studies have
mainly focused on explaining cross-national differences in growth of GDP
(caveat 5).

Overall, **[the instrumental [value]{.mark} of democracy
[is]{.mark}---at best---tentative, or---if being less mild---simply
[non-existent]{.mark}. Democracy is not necessarily better than any
alternative form of government. [With]{.mark} regard to many of the
expected benefts---such as less [war]{.mark}, less [corruption
and]{.mark} more economic [development---democracy does deliver]{.mark},
but [so do nondemocratic systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**. High or low
levels of democracy do not make a distinctive difference. Mid-range
democracy levels do matter though. Hybrid systems can be associated with
many negative outcomes, while this is also the case for democratizing
countries. Moreover, other explanations---typically certain favourable
economic factors in a country---are much more powerful to explain the
expected benefts, at least compared to the single fact that a country is
a democracy or not. The impact of democracy fades away in the powerful
shadows of the economic factors.8

But something happened **[in the early 2000s]{.underline}**. **[The
unfolding of history as liberalism had been disrupted.]{.underline}**
The attacks of **[[September 11]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the subsequent

**[[ineffectual]{.mark} wars in the Mid]{.underline}**dle

ideological demands as pre-conditions for diplomacy]{.underline}**, have
**[[devastated]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[credibility of the
U.S.-driven,]{.mark} Western [liberal order.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In
some areas, history is now forking from the liberal path with a
surprising confidence. **[Axios declared [2018 the year of the
strongman]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[but]{.underline}** it can
**[also]{.underline}** be called **[the year of liberalism in crisis[.
Russia, Egypt, China,]{.mark} Poland, Hungary, the [Philippines]{.mark},
and Turkey]{.underline}**---among others---have **[gained a
renewed]{.underline}** sense of self and **[conviction in their
opposition to liberalism]{.underline}**, as opposed to merely carving
out for themselves an unprincipled exception to liberalism and ceding it
the moral high ground[**[.]{.underline}** **[Even in
Europe]{.underline}**]{.mark}, where liberal democracy claims some of
its greatest accomplishments, **[[liberalism is beginning to
unravel]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the periphery **[[in]{.mark} countries
like [Poland, Hungary, and Italy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Jair Bolsonaro,
who notably expressed sympathy for a military dictatorship, has done
tremendously well so far in the Brazilian presidential election. Neither
soft, nor hard evangelism of liberalism is working the way it used to.
For liberal theorists, **[the prospect of a liberal democratic world
peace is now questionable.]{.underline}** The Economist has put out a
call to arms to defend liberalism as the most successful idea of the
last 400 years. Whether this call results in anything substantial
remains to be seen. But there is a palpable sense that liberalism is
facing a serious new opposition. Despite this trend, liberalism's
theorists have a hope encapsulated by Daniel Deudney and G. John
Ikenberry's 2009 pronouncement that "liberal states should not assume
that history has ended, but they can still be certain that it is on
their side." And yet, in the nine years following this bold
pronouncement, **[history has not been especially kind to
liberalism]{.underline}**. Texas A&M political science professor
Christopher Layne, writing in early 2018, has summed up the current
situation aptly, namely that China as an increasingly self-aware
superpower is already reshaping the world order away from Pax Americana:
The US foreign policy establishment does not grasp this, and, instead,
has invested the idea of a 'rules-based, institutionalized'
international order with a talismanic quality. It claims that rules and
institutions are politically neutral, and, ipso facto, beneficial for
all. However, in international politics, who rules makes the rules.
Rules and institutions reflect the distribution of power in the
international system. A power transition is taking place in the early
twenty-first century: US power is in relative decline and China is
rising quickly. No international order---not even the Pax
Americana---lasts forever. The liberal world order cannot survive the
erosion of US hegemonic power. It is this structural change, not Donald
Trump, that threatens the post-Second World War international order's
survival. It requires a huge leap of faith to believe that a risen China
will continue to subordinate itself to the Pax Americana. Which brings
us to the question: given that the prospect of an expanded democratic
peace is starting to hit some hard limits, how well does liberal
democratic peace theory actually explain the peace that has existed
among liberal democratic states? Although LDP theory is taken as an
empirical law in international relations, it has picked up a number of
qualifications, making the theory far less interesting than first
presented. Here are various renditions of the theory since its modern
inception in the 1960s: **[Claim 1: liberal democracies go to war less
than non-liberal democracies.]{.underline}** The most significant
abandonment in the field has been of the monadic hypothesis: that
liberal democratic states are less likely to go to war compared to
non-liberal democratic states. **[Henry [Farber and]{.mark} Joanne
[Gowa]{.mark}]{.underline}** have **[convincingly
[show]{.mark}]{.underline}**n **[that, [statistically]{.mark},
[democracies]{.mark} on average [have the same probability of]{.mark}
going to [war as non-democracies.]{.mark}]{.underline}** At this point,
**[no one holds the monadic hypothesis. Claim 2: no liberal democracy
has fought another liberal democracy since 1816 (notably after
1812)]{.underline}** This claim from Michael Doyle has increasingly
fallen out of favor. There weren't many democracies prior to 1945, and
so the number of dyadic pairs of liberal democratic countries that could
have gone to war was extremely limited. For example, Doyle excludes
Great Britain from counting as a liberal democracy until 1832 and denies
that the Spanish-American War of 1898 should count, even though the
Polity II data set lists Spain as a democracy in 1898. Others have
argued that the Second Philippines War of 1899 shouldn't count either,
as at the time the Philippines hadn't held an election yet.
**[[This]{.mark} strong [claim has]{.mark} largely [been dropped
because]{.mark} of a) exception cases that require new qualifications to
explain, and b) the fact that there weren't enough]{.underline}**
existing **[liberal democracies to achieve significance.]{.underline}**
All totaled, **[[there are]{.mark} around [50 exception cases]{.mark}
suggested in the literature[.]{.mark} Claim 3: mature liberal
democracies tend not to go to war/don't go to war with one
another]{.underline}** Although **[[Peru and Ecuador]{.mark} fought
while both were liberal democracies]{.underline}**, some maintain that
the war occurred before the "pacifying effects" of liberal democracy had
enough time to work, meaning maturity was
lacking**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Yet another qualification.
Interestingly, **[the [U.S. in]{.mark}tervened]{.underline}** militarily
**[to topple Salvador Allende after he was democratically elected [in
Chile. Israel invaded Lebanon]{.mark}]{.underline}** in 1981, but at the
time, Lebanon's government was in disarray. R.J. Rummel states that the
Israeli attack on the United States' USS Liberty in 1967 counts as
conflict below the level of war, but argued that Israel at the time was
"only partially free." That **[[Finland joined]{.mark} up with [the
fascists]{.mark} from 1941 to 1944]{.underline}** apparently shouldn't
count, as no Finnish troops attacked troops from a liberal democratic
country, though **[Great Britain bombed Finland in 1941.]{.underline}**
Claim 4: mature liberal democracies in the post-1945 era don't go to war
with one another The addition of the 'post-1945 era' qualification came
later in the development of LDP theory, and while it may be a
disappointing qualification, it may be necessary, given the small-N
universe of liberal democracies before 1945. Bruce Russett admits that
"the absence of murderous quarrels between democracies was not too
surprising, and may need---at least for the pre-1945 era---little
further explanation." Claim 5: mature liberal democracies in the
post-1945 era don't go to war with one another, but for normative
reasons, not structural reasons **[It's claimed that]{.underline}** the
**[structural elements]{.underline}** **[of liberal democratic
states]{.underline}**, **[namely separation of powers, checks and
balances, elections, the free press]{.underline}**, etc. should
**[result in less war]{.underline}** in general, **[but this
is]{.underline}** essentially **[equivalent to the monadic
hypothesis]{.underline}**, **[which has been largely
abandoned.]{.underline}** So, it might be possible to explain the
absence of war through the normative mechanisms of liberal democratic
states, as opposed to structural elements. Zeev Maoz and Bruce Russett
argue that while there is some support for the structural model, the
normative model has more support and better consistency. The above
examples illustrate continuing iterations of the theory. This trajectory
is by no means perfectly linear, nor is there consensus on how many
qualifications are required, but **[the fact that]{.underline}** these
**[qualifications have continued to pile on is evidence]{.underline}**
that **[[LDP]{.mark} theory [is]{.mark}]{.underline}** now much closer
to **[[triviality]{.underline}]{.mark}** than when first introduced.

Nevertheless, **[[the threat]{.mark} of subversion [should not be

particular, the **[widespread unease over the [blurring]{.mark} of [the
line]{.mark} between war and peace [must be put in]{.mark}to
[perspective.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Hybrid warfare in its original,
narrow sense describes a style of operational art: the integrated use of
conventional and unconventional methods of warfighting in the same
battlespace. **[Armed conflict]{.underline}**, whether actual or
impending, **[is integral to the concept.]{.underline}** By contrast,
hybrid warfare in its broader sense describes the use of the full range
of instruments by hostile actors in pursuit of their strategic goals.
Here, hybrid warfare no longer refers to a method of waging war, but to
the combination of diverse levers of influence for the purposes of
geopolitical competition. **[Hard power and the threat of military
confrontation remain essential components of the concept, but actual or
imminent hostilities do not. Describing non-forcible measures carried
out by hostile powers as hybrid warfare may be justified in
circumstances where these activities constitute shaping operations in
anticipation of armed conflict]{.underline}** or where they form part of
ongoing hostilities.283 **[However, [in the absence of
a]{.mark}]{.underline}**ny **[[realistic connection with
actual]{.mark}]{.underline}** or impe**[ding [war,]{.mark} labeling such
measures as acts of [warfare]{.mark}, whether hybrid or not, [is a
misnomer.]{.mark}]{.underline}**284 **[It may convey the hostile nature
of geopolitical confrontation,]{.underline}**285 **[but it is still
hyperbole[. The]{.mark} dividing [line between war and peace may look
blurred]{.mark} when it is viewed from the perspective of a wide
understanding of hybrid warfare, [but this is]{.mark}]{.underline}** so
largely **[[because]{.underline}]{.mark}** the very **[[use of the
concept in]{.underline}]{.mark}** such **[[a loose manner creates a link
between]{.mark} non-forcible [acts]{.mark} falling [below the threshold
of war and the]{.mark} mere [prospect of war.]{.mark}]{.underline}**286
Russian theorists of contemporary conflict have avoided such conceptual
freefall by insisting that violence is an integral element of
warfare.287 **[Since hybrid warfare in a broad sense does not
necessarily involve armed violence, the question arises whether mutual
defense clauses should be considered as implicated in such circumstances
at all. There are compelling reasons to answer in the
negative.]{.underline}** On their own, **[acts of [hostile interference
not entailing]{.mark} the use of [force are unlikely to subvert Article
5]{.mark} NAT]{.underline}** or Article 42(7) TEU**[[. As]{.mark}
Russia's [interventions in Georgia and Ukraine demonstrate, there is
little ev]{.mark}idence that [nonmilitary instruments]{.mark} have
[rendered]{.mark} the use of [armed force redundant. Tweets do not seize
ground]{.mark}---infantry battalions do[. Since states are not capable
of achieving]{.mark} traditional [military objectives]{.mark}, such as
seizing and holding ground, [without]{.mark} employing [armed force,
they are not able to circumvent]{.mark} mutual [defense
guarantees]{.mark} by limiting themselves solely to non-forcible
measures[.]{.mark} At the same time, the fact that specific incidents
are not caught by Article 5]{.underline}** or Article 42(7) **[does
not]{.underline}** necessarily **[point to a flaw in their design.
Take]{.underline}**, for example, the attempted murder of Sergei
**[Skripal]{.underline}** with a chemical nerve agent in Salisbury on
March 4, 2018, an act which the British Government declared to be an
unlawful use of force.288 While commentators are divided as to whether
the incident did in fact amount to the use of force,289 they concur that
it certainly did not reach the level of an armed attack.290 Indeed, the
UK and its **[[allies]{.mark} studiously [refrain]{.mark}ed [from
describing it as an]{.mark} [armed attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**.291 The
Salisbury incident thus **[escaped the reach of Article
5[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Yet **[this is not the result of some
drafting deficiency, but reflects the fact that [not every security
challenge gives rise to]{.mark} the right of [self-defense]{.mark} under
international law[.]{.mark}]{.underline}**292 Similarly, the fact that
Chinese warships support the frontline operations of Chinese civilian
and coast guard vessels in the South China Seas by providing a deterrent
effect does not mean that their mere presence constitutes an armed
attack. Nor should we assume that military force is an appropriate and
effective response to every type of threat.293 **[[There are]{.mark}
plenty of hostile [actions]{.mark} in response [to which it would be
unreasonable to use force]{.mark}---either [because doing so would be
disproportionate]{.mark} to the threat, and thus morally and politically
unpalatable, [or]{.mark} because it would carry a real [risk]{.mark} of
[escalation]{.mark} with limited prospects of compelling the adversary
to submit to our will, or both]{.underline}**.

On the other hand, **[[both]{.mark} states [might not desire]{.mark}
further [escalation]{.mark}, preferring to restrain the conflict to
cyberspace]{.underline}**. **[Each would follow the "tit-for-tat" logic
and accuse each other]{.underline}** **[while [never reaching]{.mark} a
tipping point where the conflict spills over to a [conventional
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Such a tipping point would be linked to the
intensity of the attack or the nature of the targets. **[Both [nations
would keep]{.mark} the [cyberattacks small]{.mark} enough not to trigger
a bigger reaction. The same would be observed on the choice of targets,
with both avoiding certain critical or sensitive targets, for instance
critical infrastructures.]{.underline}** In order to contain the
conflict in cyberspace, both states would have **[[to
demonstrate]{.mark} their [restraint by selecting options with
low]{.mark} risk of [miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}** (Lin, 2012,
pp. 64--66). In the future, **[[it might]{.mark} also be possible to
[see]{.mark} a [deescalation in]{.mark} the form of the emergence of an
international treaty or at least further [bilateral treaties
between]{.mark} the [USA and Russia]{.mark} on
cyberattacks]{.underline}**. For example, during the last few years,
businesses in the USA were often hacked and spied on by the Chinese
military. These intrusions were mostly cyber-economic-espionage and were
said to have supported the theft of billions of dollars' worth of
intellectual property (Bamford, 2016). **[In]{.underline}** September
**[2015, the USA and China signed an agreement engaging both countries
not to support or conduct cyber-theft of intellectual
property]{.underline}**. Moreover, the parties have made the commitment
not to use cyberattacks against each other's critical infrastructures in
peace-time and to support the establishment of international behavioral
norms in cyberspace (Rosenfeld, 2015). **[Both states also highlighted
the fact that they could not control each individual in their country
and therefore could not be held responsible for individual
acts.]{.underline}** Since then it seems that the number of attacks on
commercial targets has diminished (Timm, 2016). Former President Obama
suggested the creation of a position of cybersecurity ambassador to deal
with bilateral or multilateral treaties concerning cyber-norms (Lee,
2016). For this kind of de-escalation to take effect, the termination of
the conflict at hand must be the stated aim of both parties. A clear
common understanding of the terms of agreement is required and must be
based on trust-building efforts, as well as the assurance of mutual
adherence. The difficulty of tracking the implementation of such
agreements in cyberspace has been an obstacle preventing more states
consenting to such solutions (Lin, 2012, pp. 62--64). Nevertheless, **[a
[dialogue on cyberspace already exists]{.mark} between the USA and
Russia]{.underline}** since July 2013. This **[[cooperation
includes]{.underline}]{.mark}** Confidence Building Measures
(**[[CBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[such as the creation of working
groups on the issue of ICT security, exchange of information between the
two national]{.underline}** Computer Emergency Response Teams
([**[CERT]{.underline}**), **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the creation
of a [direct communication]{.mark} line [to]{.mark} directly
[manage]{.mark} ICT [incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Segal, 2016; The
White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 2013). In October 2016,
former President Obama used the latter to inform Russian President Putin
that the USA was accusing Russia of interference in the election process
(Ignatius, 2016). Furthermore, Russia and the USA take part in the UN
GGE supporting the future establishment of international norms on
actions in cyberspace. **[They stated that international law can be
applied in cyberspace and therefore, the rules of proportionality and
limited collateral damage should also be respected in
cyberattacks]{.underline}** (Ignatius, 2016; United Nations General
Assembly, 2015). These examples demonstrate that **[[even though]{.mark}
the two [states are involved]{.mark} in a ["tit-for-tat"]{.mark} logic
in their relations on a tactical level, [there was still]{.mark} a
[dialogue on the strategic level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least until
2015. The recent cyberattacks in USA and the election of Donald Trump as
US President, bring new uncertainties.

**[Even]{.underline}** the **[use of]{.underline}** so-called [**[hybrid
tactics]{.underline}** **[may have limited
efficacy]{.underline}**]{.mark} in the Baltic region. The three
**[[Baltic countries have been subject to an intense Russian
disinformation campaign]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[since at least
2014.]{.underline}** **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, local **[[public
opinion]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[remains]{.underline}]{.mark}**
largely **[[supportive of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[and
other]{.underline}** defense **[policy measures aimed at boosting
deterrence]{.underline}**. One reason why these societies may be
inoculated against Russian disinformation is that **[they have [grown
accustomed]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to seeing [Russia]{.mark} in
adversarial terms]{.underline}**, **[thus [making]{.mark}]{.underline}**
average **[[citizens critical]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[of]{.mark}
pro-[Kremlin]{.mark} narratives]{.underline}** (Lanoszka 2019). In
addition, **[the Baltic states have]{.underline}**
**[integrated]{.underline}** their **[minority
populations]{.underline}** **[far better than is often
assumed]{.underline}**. Although many Russophones may still lack
citizenship rights in Estonia and Latvia and so are more likely to
experience political discrimination and economic hardship,
**[they]{.underline}** nevertheless **[retain key
benefits]{.underline}** **[associated with living in the European
Union]{.underline}** (Trimbach and O'Lear 2015**[). They may have
[sympathies]{.mark} [for]{.mark}]{.underline}** aspects of
**[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}** foreign **[[policy]{.mark}, but
these]{.underline}** sympathies **[[do not translate into]{.mark} a
[preference to be reunited]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline}** (Kallas
2016). Accordingly, **[Russia faces serious obstacles]{.underline}**
**[replicating what it did in Crimea]{.underline}**. **[Russians living
in Crimea were generally sympathetic]{.underline}** to being part of
Russkiy Mir ('Russian World'), **[making them more willing to be the
objects of an annexation effort]{.underline}** (O'Loughlin, Toal, and
Kolosov 2016, 761). Further, **[Russia does not]{.underline}**
**[have]{.underline}** **[an existing military presence]{.underline}**
**[in the Baltic countries]{.underline}**---**[as it did with the Black
Sea Fleet]{.underline}** stationed in Sevastopol---that **[it could
leverage to achieve]{.underline}** easy **[faits
accomplis]{.underline}** **[and dissuade]{.underline}** potential
**[challengers]{.underline}** **[from organizing]{.underline}**. In sum,
**[[NATO]{.mark} [does not need]{.mark} to have [a heavy
footprint]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[in the Baltic]{.underline}** region
**[[to deter]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian
**[[aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Russia would have to overcome
major operational challenges]{.underline}** **[if it wished to undertake
a successful]{.underline}** **[conquest of the Baltic
countries]{.underline}**. Of course, none of this is to invite
complacency about Baltic security. The Baltic states and Poland should
deepen regional cooperation in order to ensure that no key policy
diferences exist between them (Jermalavicius et al. 2018).
**[They]{.underline}** also **[face]{.underline}** potential
**[vulnerabilities at sea]{.underline}** and so need to improve the
resilience of their undersea and maritime infrastructure (Schaub et al.
2017). Still, the defensibility of the Baltic region helps illuminate
why Russia resorts to disinformation campaigns, airspace incursions,
vague nuclear threats, and other attempts at subversion. It cannot do
much more lest it would provoke an unwanted response.

#### Hybrid war does not escalate---many checks

**[Sorensen & Nyemann, Royal Danish Defence College, scholars,
'19]{.underline}**

The Flipside of Deterrence by Punishment -- the Fear of Escalation

**[[One]{.mark} of the]{.underline}** greatest **[[reservation]{.mark}s
against communicating a willingness to take punitive actions
[concerns]{.mark} the [risk of escalation]{.mark} and increased tension
due to a more assertive]{.underline}** or offensive **[posture.
[Yet]{.mark} when looking into possible responses -- retaliation in
cyberspace, for example -- a number of ["self-dampening" mechanisms
appear]{.mark} to be [in place]{.mark} that may be applicable to many
types of responses]{.underline}**.30 **[[One]{.mark} example [is]{.mark}
the requirement to establish]{.underline}** some level of
**[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** of aggression on which to base a
response. As discussed above, while attribution is rarely impossible,
**[it can be a time-consuming and technically-challenging endeavor. In a
high-stakes scenario the time taken]{.underline}** to get attribution as
right as possible **[means [there will be plenty of time to think
twice]{.mark} about actions and consequences, [and]{.mark} to [lean on
diplomatic measures]{.mark} in parallel. [An example]{.mark} of a
self-dampening mechanism [related to]{.mark} the [cyber]{.mark} domain
[is]{.mark} the [large investment]{.mark} required to develop credible
offensive capabilities. Moreover, an offensive cyber capability is a
transitory tool]{.underline}**31. **[The ability to access a computer
system or network to cause harm or damage is only temporary and
dependent on a very rapid and ongoing patching of
vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. At the same time, wielding the cyber
instrument despite the downside of "burning" the capacity might have a
de-escalatory effect by communicating capability and credibility to the
opponent with a view to discouraging future hostile attacks.
**[[Targeting]{.mark} in any domain]{.underline}** -- including
cyberspace -- **[[must]{.mark} also [follow]{.mark} relevant
[rules]{.mark}]{.underline}**, law and due-process **[[which]{.mark}
will [self-limit]{.mark} the range of [targets]{.mark} and actions
available.]{.underline}**

**[[A]{.mark} final ["escalatory showstopper" is]{.mark} related to the
challenge of identifying and developing targets of adequate strategic
significance -- not too much, not too little -- to achieve the desired
effect. Responding to hybrid aggression by applying "middle range"
punitive [actions]{.mark} that are [proportionate]{.mark} to the
aggression threatened or suffered [will]{.mark} also [self-limit]{.mark}
the escalatory potential. [It is unlikely]{.mark} to be [in the interest
of any]{.mark} hybrid aggressor [to pursue a]{.mark}n escalatory
[spiral]{.mark} above and beyond where they were looking to compete in
the first place: on the hybrid level]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, one
way to mitigate the risk of escalation -- while enhancing civilian
oversight and interagency coordination -- would be to establish rules of
engagement for punitive actions on the hybrid level32 . This would
provide decision-makers with common guidelines to pursue punitive
actions that fall below the "use of force threshold". Moreover, this
could actually bolster the credibility of punitive actions by signaling
to hybrid aggressors the intent to take pre-prepared punitive actions
when deemed necessary: in other words, a "playbook" for countering
hybrid threats.

### Hybrid War Ans: Disinformation

#### The alternative is no news

**[Hurwitz '17]{.underline}** \[Justin Hurwitz, Assistnat Professor,
Law, University of Nebraska, "Fake News Not-So-Real Antitrust Problem:
Content Remains King," Compeittion Policy International, 2017,
<https://laweconcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/CPI-Hurwitz.pdf>,
accessed 10-5-21\]

**[[Nor are there]{.underline}]{.mark}** vertical -- or to use the
antitrust newspeak, **[[platform -- concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}**
driving the problem **[[of fake news]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Facebook is
a

platform-based distributor of information, including news. This means
that news is (one of many) inputs into Facebook. Hubbard suggests

that Facebook's gatekeeper position allows it to harm the traditional
media in an effort to keep people on Facebook's own site. She points,

in particular, to Facebook's use of its proprietary in-app browser and
Instant Articles feature, arguing that Facebook uses these to lock

users in to Facebook's platform, denying third-party news sites valuable
analytics and advertising revenue, and making it more difficult

for users to navigate away from Facebook.

As an initial matter, in-app browsers have become common. Facebook,
Twitter, and Google News all use them. This suggests that

they have been implemented to address a technological problem -- to make
the mobile browsing experience better for users of each

platform. And, indeed, this is the case. Websites that have not been
redesigned specifically for mobile platforms often do not work well.

Even websites that do have mobile versions often do not work
particularly well. The user experience between those websites is often
nonstandard, which inconveniences users and may encourage them to
discontinue their use of both that website and the platform that sent

them there. By using an in-app browser -- and especially by offering a
standardized format for presenting news content across sites in that

browser -- platforms can (at least in principle -- I will not defend the
quality of many in-app browsers, with the recognition that they are a

new and improving technology) offer users a superior experience. This
means that they will make more use of a platform, yes, benefitting,

for instance, Facebook -- but it also means that they will consume more
content via that platform, benefitting, for instance, media outlets.

Importantly, mobile browsing, where we see these in-app browsers, is
different from browsing in a desktop environment. When

a user is sent to a website for an article on a mobile device, they are
unlikely to stay on that website once they are done with the article.

Rather, they are likely to exit out of the browser, which sends them
back to whatever source sent them to the website initially. This means

that users are "locked in" to the Facebook platform no matter whether it
uses an in-app or external browser.

Hubbard is exactly right that in-app browsers and Instant Articles are
an effort to keep users engaged with the Facebook platform.

But the **[[alternative is not users engaging more with news outlets'
platforms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The **[[alternative is
users]{.underline}]{.mark}** getting frustrated with news outlets'
mobile experiences and **[[finding more enjoyable ways to spend their
t]{.underline}]{.mark}**ime than waiting for poorly-rendered webpages to
load. Facebook knows that if they can make articles quick and easy to
access, more people will spend more time on their phones. This is why
Facebook is willing to offer content providers a significant share of ad
revenue. And, to the extent that publishers of any sort continue to
produce content that Facebook users want to engage with, those
publishers will continue to be able to demand such a share of revenue.
**[[Facebook has no incentive to deny its users access to content linked
to via Facebook]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To the contrary, it **[[has
every incentive to get them]{.underline}]{.mark}** seamless
**[[access]{.mark}]{.underline}** to that content, and is willing to pay
to do so.

### Hybrid War Ans: Empirics

#### Empirics prove---Russia [prefers]{.underline} keeping hybrid tactics at a [low enough level]{.underline} to avoid escalation.

**[Ferris 18]{.underline}**

RUSI, specialising in Russia and Eurasia's foreign policy. British IR
think tank). Ferris, Emily. 2018. "Probing the Baltic States: Why
Russia's Ambitions Do Not Have a Security Dimension." RUSI. November 21,
2018.

Accessed 2/9/19.

As a political and military reassurance, a recent NATO exercise in the
Baltic region makes sense. But **[Russia's real levers of influence over
the Baltic states are not military]{.underline}**, and NATO may not be
the appropriate answer**[.]{.underline}** On 7 November, NATO conducted
military training drills with Poland which included, among others,
relatively large contingents from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia
and Lithuania. Anaconda 2018 was an exercise in political reassurance
and an effort to test the Alliance's emergency response and
reinforcement procedures. However, it is not clear that military
exercises of this kind reflect the real security needs of the Baltic
states. While Baltic state leaders are apprehensive about Russia's
intent towards their countries, **[it is unlikely that Russia
has]{.underline}** serious **[territorial ambitions there.
[Russia]{.mark} certainly [maintains]{.mark} a serious [interest
in]{.mark} gaining deeper [involvement]{.mark} in political,
intelligence and business processes [in]{.mark} all three [Baltic
states, but]{.mark}]{.underline}** it is **[not]{.underline}** clear
that this is a NATO issue that could be resolved by a
**[military]{.underline}** response**[.]{.underline}** **[Military
Engagement Unlikely]{.underline}** **[Russia [will not]{.mark} risk
[directly engag]{.mark}]{.underline}**ing **[with [a NATO member, which
would prompt a response]{.mark} from other member states.]{.underline}**
While it is one thing to militarily engage with a country like Ukraine
that has never enjoyed NATO membership, it is quite another to test
NATO's mutual guarantee, underwritten by the US. Baltic state leaders
have become increasingly concerned following Russia's 2014 annexation of
Crimea, which raised questions about changing borders in Europe. The
Baltic states are particularly concerned by Russia's military exercises,
maintaining that they could be preparation for land invasions, but there
is no evidence to suggest that this year's Vostok exercises or last
year's Zapad training intended to take over Baltic territory. **[Russia
has little desire to become embroiled in a conflict so close to its own
borders, [given it]{.mark}]{.underline}**s **[messy and expensive
involvement in eastern Ukraine[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Second and
**[more importantly,]{.underline}** **[Russia [already exerts
significant influence]{.mark} over the Baltic
states[,]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[through its high penetration of the
Baltics' political and intelligence processes, as well as business
networks. While Russia certainly has interests in probing the Baltic
states' capabilities, these are unlikely to take on an outright military
dimension, such as an overt territorial aggression.]{.underline}**
Spheres of Influence Notwithstanding Russia's unwillingness to engage
militarily with the Baltics, Russia still considers these countries to
be within its historic sphere of influence. The Russian authorities
retain a strong interest in gathering intelligence on political and
military processes there. Russia's intelligence penetration of all three
Baltic states is thought to be very high. Lithuania's State Security
Department published its National Threat Assessment in March, noting
Russia's active intelligence operations targeting Lithuania's foreign
and domestic policies, including attempts to influence the public in the
run-up to the 2019 Lithuanian presidential elections. Estonia has also
seen increasing Russian intelligence activity. There have been several
high-profile spy swaps, and in September a senior Estonian army officer
from the Ministry of Defence and his father were detained for spying on
behalf of the Russian military intelligence (the GRU). Russia also
allocates significant intelligence-gathering resources to assess the
Baltic states' military capabilities. All three Baltic states maintain
that **[[Russia works alongside Belarus]{.underline}]{.mark}**ian
**[[intelligence]{.mark} services [to recruit informants]{.mark},
particularly from the Lithuanian military.]{.underline}** The Baltics
are also concerned by Russia's military build-up in the exclave of
Kaliningrad (near Lithuania), but the Russian authorities consider the
Baltics' cooperation with institutions such as NATO, including its
consolidation of troops and hardware close to its borders, to be an
aggressive act. Business as Usual? **[Russia also [maintains]{.mark}
significant [influence in the]{.mark} Baltic [business
community]{.mark}]{.underline}**, particularly in Latvia and
Estonia**[.]{.underline}** Despite Estonia's strong anti-corruption
stance, the **[beneficial owners of many businesses are thought to have
close links to the Kremlin. Russian business interests still dominate
the Latvian banking sector]{.underline}**, which in the early 2000s
became **[known as Russia's 'laundromat']{.underline}** because of the
banking system's reputation for processing the proceeds of crime and
corruption. In February 2018 allegations of widespread money laundering,
funds of which were thought to originate in Russia, prompted the US
Treasury Department to threaten to sanction one of Latvia's largest
banks, ABLV, which was eventually liquidated. All three Baltic states
are attempting to reduce their reliance on gas and electricity from
Russia and link to the EU power grid instead, but this is a long-term
ambition that is unlikely to be fully operational before 2025. Lithuania
has managed to reduce its reliance on Russian gas through its LNG port
at Klaipėda and also imports gas from Norway -- Russian state-controlled
gas giant Gazprom has divested its shares in most of the Baltic gas
companies. However, Gazprom still has a large stake in Latvias Gāze,
Latvia's state-controlled gas company, even though the gas market was
officially liberalised in 2017. Russia has in the past used its control
over gas and energy markets to pressure countries into political
concessions, particularly Belarus, which remains a security concern for
Latvia. Russian-Speaking Communities **[One of the most frequently
discussed levers of Russian [influence]{.mark} in the Baltics is through
the significant [Russian-speaking minorities]{.mark} in Estonia and
Latvia]{.underline}** -- around a quarter of the population in Latvia.
The Baltic states maintain that **[the Kremlin]{.underline}** could
**[influence this community [by playing on their grievances]{.mark},
emphasising their political and economic marginalisation]{.underline}**
-- many ethnic Russians do not have citizenship and are given
'non-citizen' status, preventing them from voting in national
elections**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As part of this, **[the Russian
Duma]{.underline}** (parliament) **[is in the process of [passing a bill
to simplify citizenship]{.mark} procedures for ethnic Russians living
abroad.]{.underline}** The bill will apply to countries that have
'difficult' political or economic situations such as an armed conflict
(likely to refer to Ukraine), but also refers to the Baltic states,
claiming that ethnic Russians' rights are under threat there. While the
bill is likely to be a measure to counter Russia's demographic concerns
by encouraging skilled migrants to return to Russia for work, it also
indicates Russia's ongoing attention to this community in the Baltics.
However, these ethnic Russian communities are not a united movement
seeking regime change in the Baltics. Aside from Russia's ability to
convey a narrative through the media, it is not clear that this
translates into any cohesive action from the community that could have
any security or fundamental political implications -- pro-Russia
demonstrations tend to be small and poorly attended. Moreover, despite
Russian speakers' grievances in Estonia and Latvia, as EU member states
their standard of living remains higher than in Russia, and there is no
widespread support for migration back into Russia. Ultimately,
**[[Russia has]{.mark} no desire to territorially expand into the Baltic
states, but it does have several [tools at its disposal]{.mark} to
influence these states, which are likely to remain confined to the
business and intelligence community.]{.underline}** Notwithstanding
their socio-political grievances, the Russian-speaking community in the
Baltics does not presents a serious security threat to their own
governments. While Russia often probes the Baltic states' military and
intelligence capabilities, this intelligence-gathering strategy is
unlikely to escalate into open hostilities.

### Hybrid War Ans: Russia Cyber

#### They have [zero interest]{.underline} in producing [widespread]{.underline} damage

**[Lewis 18]{.underline}**---(Senior Vice President at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies, Ph.D. from the University of
Chicago). Dr. James Andrew Lewis. January 2018, "Rethinking
Cybersecurity: Strategy, Mass Effect, and States,"
<https://tinyurl.com/y27xcqbb>, p. 7-11

Similarly, **[the popular idea that opponents use cyber techniques to
inflict cumulative economic harm is not supported by evidence. Economic
warfare has always been part of conflict, but [there are no examples
of]{.mark} a country seeking to imperceptibly [harm]{.mark} the economy
of an opponent]{.underline}**. The United States engaged in economic
warfare during the Cold War, and still uses sanctions as a tool of
foreign power, but few if any other nations do the same. The intent of
cyber espionage is to gain market or technological advantage. Coercive
actions against government agencies or companies are intended to
intimidate. **[Terrorists do not seek to inflict economic
damage]{.underline}**. **[The difficulty of wreaking real harm on large,
interconnected economies is usually ignored]{.underline}**. Economic
warfare in cyberspace is ascribed to China, but China\'s cyber doctrine
has three elements: control of cyberspace to preserve party rule and
political stability, espionage (both commercial and military), and
preparation for disruptive acts to damage an opponent\'s weapons,
military information systems, and command and control. \"Strategic\"
uses, such as striking civilian infrastructure in the opponent\'s
homeland, appear to be a lower priority and are an adjunct to nuclear
strikes as part of China\'s strategic deterrence. Chinese officials seem
more concerned about accelerating China\'s growth rather than some
long-term effort to undermine the American economy.6 The 2015 agreement
with the United States served Chinese interests by centralizing tasking
authority in Beijing and ending People\'s Liberation Army (PLA)
\"freelancing\" against commercial targets. **[The Russians specialize
in coercion, financial crime, and creating harmful cognitive
effect]{.underline}**---the ability to manipulate emotions and
decisionmaking. Under their 2010 military doctrine on disruptive
information operations (part of what they call \"New Generation
Warfare\"). **[[Russians want confusion, not]{.mark} physical
[damage]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Iran and North Korea use cyber actions
against American banks or entertainment companies like Sony or the Sands
Casino, but their goal is political coercion, not destruction. None of
these countries talk about death by 1000 cuts or attacking critical
infrastructure to produce a cyber Pearl Harbor or any of the other
scenarios that dominate the media. The few disruptive attacks on
critical infrastructure have focused almost exclusively on the energy
sector. Major financial institutions face a high degree of risk but in
most cases, the attackers\' intent is to extract money. **[[There have
been]{.mark} cases of [service disruption and data erasure, but]{.mark}
these have been limited in scope. Denial-of-service attacks against
banks impede services and may be costly to the targeted bank, but [do
not have a major effect on the]{.mark} national
[economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [I]{.mark}n all of these actions,
**[there is a line that countries have been unwilling to cross. When our
opponents decided to challenge American \"hegemony,\" they developed
[strategies]{.mark} to [circumvent]{.mark} the risks of
[retal]{.mark}iation or escalation [by ensuring]{.mark} that their
[actions stayed below the use-of-force
threshold]{.mark}]{.underline}**---an imprecise threshold, roughly
defined by international law, but usually **[[considered to
involve]{.underline}]{.mark}** actions that produce **[[destruction or
casualties.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Almost **[[all cyber attacks fall
below this]{.mark} threshold, including, crime, espionage, and
politically coercive acts. This explains why the decades-long quest to
rebuild Cold War deterrence in cyberspace has been
fruitless.]{.underline}** It also explains why we have not seen the
dreaded cyber Pearl Harbor or other predicted catastrophes. Opponents
are keenly aware that launching catastrophe brings with it immense risk
of receiving catastrophe in return. States are the only actors who can
carry out catastrophic cyber attacks and they are very unlikely to do so
in a strategic environment that seeks to gain advantage without engaging
in armed conflict. Decisions on targets and attack make sense only when
embedded in their larger strategic calculations regarding how best to
fight with the United States. There have been thousands of incidents of
cybercrime and cyber espionage, but only a handful of true attacks,
where the intent was not to extract information or money, but to disrupt
and, in a few cases, destroy. From these incidents, we can extract a
more accurate picture of risk. The salient incidents are the cyber
operations against Iran\'s nuclear weapons facility (Stuxnet), Iran\'s
actions against Aramco and leading American banks, North Korean
interference with Sony and with South Korean banks and television
stations, and Russian actions against Estonia, Ukrainian power
facilities, Canal 5 (television network in France), and the 2016 U S.
presidential elections. Cyber attacks are not random. All of these
incidents have been part of larger geopolitical conflicts involving
Iran, Korea, and the Ukraine, or Russia\'s contest with the United
States and NATO. **[There are commonalities in each attack. All were
undertaken by state actors or proxy forces to achieve the attacking
state\'s policy objectives]{.underline}**. **[Only two caused tangible
damage]{.underline}**; the rest created coercive effect, intended to
create confusion and psychological pressure through fear, uncertainty,
and embarrassment. **[In no instance were there deaths or
casualties]{.underline}**. **[[In two decades of cyber attacks, there
has never been a]{.mark} single [casualty]{.mark}. This alone should
give pause to the doomsayers]{.underline}**. **[[Nor]{.mark} has there
been widespread [collateral damage]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Hybrid War Ans: Status Quo Solves

#### NATO is bolstering deterrence and ability to combat hybrid threats now

**[King, CSIS fellow, '19]{.underline}**

\[Iain King, Visting Fellow, Center for Strategic and International
Studies, "NATO Is Not Brain Dead Yet," THE HILL, 11---12---19,
<https://thehill.com/opinion/international/470060-nato-is-not-brain-dead-yet/>\]

**[[It is true]{.mark} that [Europe]{.mark} has [witnessed]{.mark} some
[very bad defensive decisions in the past]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A few
military planners in the 1930s expected cavalry to have a combat role in
the coming war. Others assumed that bomber aircraft would be decisive.
Too much faith was placed in the Maginot Line, the robust concrete wall
which defended against German tanks, until the panzers simply went
around it. European defense is still vulnerable to strategic shocks
today, and some of these have exposed flaws in earlier calculations by
NATO. **[Take the Russian annexation of Crimea or the ongoing Russian
use of hybrid attacks to destabilize neighbors and adversaries,
including cybersecurity attacks and political meddling.]{.underline}**

**[[But]{.mark} like any credible military outfit, [NATO has been
industrious in its efforts to learn from these episodes and]{.mark}
[correct]{.mark} for the vulnerabilities they uncovered. [Following
Crimea]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example, **[[NATO has made sure it
can mobilize a]{.mark} [well-equipped force
swiftly]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ready **[[to meet]{.mark} and match any
[Russian forces trying to enter the Baltic
states]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[exercises have adapted to make hybrid attacks center
stage]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[forcing military minds to think through
their response to a complicated challenge. [NATO has also been working
hard to counter Russian efforts to spread lies
online.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Liberal Order Ans: 1NC

#### Claims about the liberal order are false

**[Staniland, Chicago professor, '18]{.underline}**

\[Paul Stnailand, Asosciate Professor, Political Seicne, University of
Chicago, "Misreading the 'Liberal Order': Why We Need New Thinking in
American Foreign Policy, LAWFARE, 7---29---18,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/misreading-liberal-order-why-we-need-new-thinking-american-foreign-policy>\]

**[Pushing back against Trump's foreign policy is an important
goal.]{.underline}** But **[moving forward requires a more serious
analysis than claiming that the "liberal international order" was the
centerpiece of past U.S. foreign-policy successes]{.underline}**, **[and
thus should be again. Both claims are flawed. [We need to understand the
limits of the liberal international order]{.mark},]{.underline}** where
it previously failed to deliver benefits, and why it offers little
guidance for many contemporary questions.

First, **[advocates of the order tend to skim past the [policies]{.mark}
pursued [under the l]{.mark}iberal [o]{.mark}rder that [have not
worked]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These mistakes need to be directly
confronted to do better in the future.

**[[Proponents]{.mark} of the order]{.underline}**, however, often
**[[present a]{.mark} narrow and highly [selective reading of history
that ignores]{.mark} [much of the coercion, violence, and instability
that accompanied post-war history]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Problematic
outcomes are treated as]{.underline}** either **[aberrant
exceptions]{.underline}** or as not truly characterizing the order. One
recent defense of the liberal order by prominent liberal
institutionalists Daniel **[Deudney and]{.underline}** G. John
**[[Ikenberry]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, **[[does not mention
Iraq]{.mark}, Afghanistan, [Vietnam, or Libya]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Professors Stephen Chaudoin, Helen Milner, and Dustin Tingley herald the
order's "support for freedom, democracy, human rights, a free press."
Kori Schake writes that Western democracies' wars are "about enlarging
the perimeter of security and prosperity, expanding and consolidating
the liberal order." Historian Hal **[Brands]{.underline}** argues that
the order **[has advocated]{.underline}** "**[political
liberalism]{.underline}** in the form of representative government and
human rights; and other liberal concepts, such as nonaggression,
self-determination, and the peaceful settlement of disputes."

Other analysts have persuasively argued that **[these accounts create an
"imagined" picture of post-World War II history.]{.underline}** Patrick
**[Porter outlines in detail how coercive, violent, and hypocritical
U.S. foreign policy has often been]{.underline}**. To the extent an
international liberal order ever actually existed beyond a small cluster
of countries, writes Nick Danforth, it was recent and short-lived.
Thomas Meaney and Stephen Wertheim further argue that "**[critics
exaggerate]{.underline}** Mr. **[Trump's abnormality]{.underline}**,"

self-interest. Graham Allison---no bomb-throwing radical---has recently

The last two decades have been a bumpy ride for U.S. foreign policy.
Since 9/11, we have seen the disintegration of Syria, Yemen, and Libya,
a war without end in Afghanistan, the collapse of the Arab Spring, the
rise and resurgence of the Islamic State, and the distinctly mixed
success of strategies aimed at managing China's rise. At home, the
growth of a national-security state has placed remarkable power in the
hands of Donald Trump. **[Simply returning to the old order is no
guarantee of good results.]{.underline}** Grappling openly with failure
and self-inflicted wounds---while also acknowledging clear benefits of
the order---is essential for moving beyond self-congratulatory
platitudes.

### Liberal Order Ans: 2NC

#### No authoritarianism impact---pushback now solves

**[Leong '19]{.underline}** \[Clarence Leong, journalist, "In an Age of
Authoritarianism, the World Sees Glimmers of Hope," CHRISTIAN SCIENCE
MONITOR, 3---19---19,

In the past year, citizens of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Ethiopia have taken to the streets to demand accountability from their
governments, while voters in Malaysia and the Maldives ousted corrupt
governments at the ballot box. **[[Countries]{.mark} with a strong civil
society or decent-sized middle class continue to [push back]{.mark}
[against autocrats]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even though the headlines are
more often about the threats to democracy.

That's not to say democracy has nothing to worry about. A new paper
published this month found that the world has been in "a wave of
autocratization" since 1994, and as many as 75 democracies have seen a
reversal to autocracy. Modern-day autocrats know better than to
blatantly shore up power, but do so gradually and under a legal facade,
making it harder to detect, researchers say. Autocrats pit
authoritarianism against democracy, promoting it as a more efficient
form of governance and spreading the technology that strengthens
control. Social media amplifies the spread of misinformation, clouding
voters' judgment.

Global freedom, which is composed of political rights and civil
liberties, has been in decline for the 13th year in a row, according to
a new report from Freedom House. But the same report also notes
significant improvement in accountability for corruption in Angola,
Armenia, and other nations. **[[Political participation]{.mark} in most
parts of the world [has seen a continuous upward trend,]{.mark}
reports]{.underline}** The Economist. And while
**[[autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark}** threaten democracies, they
**[[are]{.mark} also "[fueling a powerful
counterattack]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Human Rights Watch notes in its
latest annual report.

"**[[Those who]{.mark} are [bemoa]{.mark}ning this [authoritarian
turn]{.mark} in the world were [overstat]{.mark}ing [the
case]{.mark}]{.underline}**," says Steven Levitsky, a political
scientist at Harvard and co-author of "How Democracies Die." The
euphoric expansion of democracy in the 1990s led to the over-optimistic
belief that authoritarianism was a thing of the past, and now that
expectation has been dashed, he says. But "**[there's yet to emerge a
real, viable, truly legitimate alternative to democracy in the
world."]{.underline}**

That doesn't discount the fact that people are disillusioned with
traditional political parties and losing confidence in democracy. But
rather than disengaging from it, that dissatisfaction is driving
citizens to participate in political processes, according to The
Economist. Voter turnout and membership of political parties rose,
reversing a downward trend. A larger proportion of the world's
population is now willing to engage in lawful demonstrations. The
Economist also notes a particularly striking area of progress coming
from female participation in politics.

"**[[Women have become much more active]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not just
in \[the\] U.S. but **[around the world]{.underline}**," says Steven
Leslie, lead analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit. "**[There is an
ongoing surge of female participation in politics and [in activities
that are essential to democracy]{.mark}." Barriers like discriminatory
laws and socioeconomic obstacles are gradually being
removed.]{.underline}** In Rwanda and Ethiopia, half of the cabinet
ministers are women. New legislation in Japan encourages gender parity
in parliament. In the United States, the voters in the November midterms
elected the highest number of women to Congress in history -- though
they still make up only 23.7 percent.

Still, the international atmosphere has become less favorable to the
expansion of democracy. Not only is the totalitarian state of China
spreading its influence, but cracks are appearing in decades-old
alliances such as the European Union and NATO. In the EU, both Italy and
Turkey saw their rankings in The Economist's democracy index fall by at
least 10 places. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the U.S.
is becoming more isolationist, analysts say.

"America's commitment to the global progress of democracy in its foreign
policy has been seriously compromised," says Sarah Repucci, senior
director for research and analysis at Freedom House.

In one example, when the U.S. withdrew from the council on human rights
at the United Nations, it left "a huge vacuum of power," says Rosa
Freedman, a professor of law, conflict, and global development at the
University of Reading in England and author of several books on the U.N.

Despite the downward trends, however, **[[countries are forming]{.mark}
new [alliances to]{.mark} put [pressure]{.mark} on [repressive
regimes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, reports Human Rights Watch. It points to
the example of the EU and a group of Muslim-majority countries working
together to create a mechanism at the U.N. to collect evidence on the
ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas, which could be used in future trials of
the Myanmar government. A group of Latin American countries led a
resolution in the Human Rights Council to condemn the severe persecution
of Venezuelans under President Nicolás Maduro.

**[Other human rights mechanisms have sprung up in unexpected
place]{.underline}**s, adds Joseph Saunders, deputy program director at
Human Rights Watch. For example, the organizing bodies of big sports
tournaments, such as the World Cup and the Olympics, will scrutinize the
bidders and hosts' human rights records.

"These are obviously dark times," says Mr. Saunders. "But \[you\]
**[miss a large part of the picture if you don't see the pushback that
is]{.underline}** also **[happening]{.underline}**."

**[[Digital]{.mark} [autho]{.mark}ritarianism [is on the

monitors internet freedoms. Freedom House, a pro-democracy think tank,
said today that **[[governments]{.mark} are [seek]{.mark}ing more
[control over]{.mark} users' [data]{.mark} while also using
laws]{.underline}** nominally intended to address "fake news" **[to
[suppress dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It **[marked the eighth
consecutive year that Freedom House found a decline in online
freedoms]{.underline}** around the world.

"The clear emergent theme in this report is the growing recognition that
**[the [internet]{.mark}]{.underline}**, once seen as a liberating
technology, **[[is]{.mark} increasingly being [used to disrupt
democracies]{.mark} as opposed to destabilizing
dictatorships]{.underline}**," said Mike Abramowitz, president of
Freedom House, in a call with reporters. "**[Propaganda and
disinformation are increasingly poisoning the digital sphere, and
authoritarians and [populists]{.mark} are using the [fight against fake
news as a pretext to jail]{.mark} prominent journalists and social media
[critic]{.mark}s, often through laws that criminalize the spread of
false information."]{.underline}**

**[In the United States, internet freedom declined in 2018 due
to]{.underline}** the Federal Communications Commission's **[repeal of
net neutrality rules]{.underline}**. **[Other countries fared much
worse]{.underline}** --- 17 out of 65 surveyed had adopted laws
restricting online media. Of those, 13 prosecuted citizens for allegedly
spreading false information. And more countries are accepting training
and technology from China, which Freedom House describes as an effort to
export a system of censorship and surveillance around the world.

Of course, there are tradeoffs between freedom and security. The report
is critical of Sri Lanka and India, which have periodically shut down or
limited access to the internet in response to the outbreak of ethnic and
religious conflict. In both cases, citizens were being murdered by mobs
that had encountered misinformation spread through social media.

"Cutting off internet service is a draconian response, particularly at a
time when citizens may need it the most, whether to dispel rumors, check
in with loved ones, or avoid dangerous areas," said Adrian Shahbaz,
research director for technology and democracy. "While deliberately
falsified content is a genuine problem, some **[governments are
increasingly using 'fake news' as a pretense to consolidate their
control over information and suppress dissent."]{.underline}**

The report also found:

\* **[[Governments]{.mark} in 18 countries [increased state
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** between June 2017 and now, with 15
considering new "data protection" laws, which can require companies to
store user data locally and potentially make it easier for governments
to access.

\* **[[Governments]{.mark} in 32 countries used paid commentators, bots,
and trolls in an effort to [manipulate online
conversations]{.mark}]{.underline}**. WhatsApp and other closed
messaging apps are becoming more popular targets for manipulation, the
authors write.

\* There were bright spots. The authors credit Armenian citizens' use of
social media, communications apps, and live-streaming services for
making possible a peaceful revolution earlier this year. And in
Ethiopia, a new prime minster released bloggers and activists from
prison and pledged to ease restrictions on online communication.

### Liberal Order Ans: Doomed

#### GLO doomed 

**[Mead '21]{.underline}** \[Walter Russell Mead, Professor, Foreign
Affairs and Humanities, Bard College, "The End of the Wilsonian Era: Why
Lilberal Internationalism Faled," FOREIGN AFFAIRS, January / February
2021, Ebsco\]

This task was complicated by the Cold War, but \"the free world\" (as
Americans then called the noncommunist countries) continued to develop
along Wilsonian lines. Inevitable compromises, such as U.S. support for
ruthless dictators and military rulers in many parts of the world, were
seen as regrettable necessities imposed by the need to fight the much
greater evil of Soviet communism. When the Berlin Wall fell, in 1989, it
seemed that the opportunity for a Wilsonian world order had finally
come. The former Soviet empire could be reconstructed along Wilsonian
lines, and the West could embrace Wilsonian principles more consistently
now that the Soviet threat had disappeared. Self-determination, the rule
of law between and within countries, liberal economics, and the
protection of human rights: the \"new world order\" that both the George
H. W. Bush and the Clinton administrations worked to create was very
much in the Wilsonian mold.

Today, however, **[the most important fact in world politics is that
this noble effort has failed. The next stage in world history will not
unfold along Wilsonian lines.]{.underline}** The
**[nations]{.underline}** of the earth **[will continue to seek some
kind of political order,]{.underline}** because they must. And human
rights activists and others will continue to work toward their goals.
But **[the [dream of]{.mark} a [universal order]{.mark}, grounded in
law, that secures peace between countries and democracy inside them
[will figure less and les]{.mark}s in the work of world
leaders.]{.underline}**

**[To state this truth is not to welcome it]{.underline}**. There are
many advantages to a Wilsonian world order, even when that order is
partial and incomplete. **[Many analysts]{.underline}**, some associated
with the presidential campaign of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden,
**[think they can put Humpty Dumpty together again]{.underline}**. One
wishes them every success. But **[the centrifugal [forces tearing
at]{.mark} the Wilsonian [order are so deeply rooted]{.mark} in the
nature of the contemporary world [that not even the end of]{.mark} the
[Trump]{.mark} era [can revive the]{.mark} Wilsonian [project]{.mark}
in]{.underline}** its most ambitious form. Although Wilsonian ideals
will not disappear and there will be a continuing influence of Wilsonian
thought on U.S. foreign policies, **[the halcyon days of the post-Cold
War era, when American presidents organized their foreign policies
around the principles of liberal internationalism, are unlikely to
return]{.underline}** anytime soon.

THE ORDER OF THINGS

Wilsonianism is only one version of a rules-based world order among
many. The Westphalian system, which emerged in Europe after the Thirty
Years\' War ended in 1648, and the Congress system, which arose in the
wake of the Napoleonic Wars of the early nineteenth century, were both
rules-based and even law-based; some of the foundational ideas of
international law date from those eras. And the Holy Roman Empire\--a
transnational collection of territories that stretched from France into
modern-day Poland and from Hamburg to Milan\-- was an international
system that foreshadowed the European Union, with highly complex rules
governing everything from trade to sovereign inheritance among princely
houses.

As for human rights, by the early twentieth century, the pre-Wilsonian
European system had been moving for a century in the direction of
putting egregious violations of human rights onto the international
agenda. Then, as now, it was chiefly weak countries whose oppressive
behavior attracted the most attention. The genocidal murder of Ottoman
Christian minorities at the hands of Ottoman troops and irregular forces
in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries received
substantially more attention than atrocities carried out around the same
time by Russian forces against rebellious Muslim peoples in the
Caucasus. No delegation of European powers came to Washington to discuss
the treatment of Native Americans or to make representations concerning
the status of African Americans. Nevertheless, the pre-Wilsonian
European order had moved significantly in the direction of elevating
human rights to the level of diplomacy.

Wilson, therefore, was not introducing the ideas of world order and
human rights to a collection of previously anarchic states and
unenlightened polities. Rather, his quest was to reform an existing
international order whose defects had been conclusively demonstrated by
the horrors of World War I. In the pre-Wilsonian order, established
dynastic rulers were generally regarded as legitimate, and interventions
such as the 1849 Russian invasion of Hungary, which restored Habsburg
rule, were considered lawful. Except in the most glaring instances,
states were more or less free to treat their citizens or subjects as
they wished, and although governments were expected to observe the
accepted principles of public international law, no supranational body
was charged with the enforcement of these standards. The preservation of
the balance of power was invoked as a goal to guide states; war,
although regrettable, was seen as a legitimate element of the system.
From Wilson\'s standpoint, these were fatal flaws that made future
conflagrations inevitable. To redress them, he sought to build an order
in which states would accept enforceable legal restrictions on their
behavior at home and their international conduct.

That never quite materialized, but until recent years, the U.S.-led
postwar order resembled Wilson\'s vision in important respects. And, it
should be noted, that vision is not equally dead everywhere. Although
Wilson was an American, his view of world order was first and foremost
developed as a method for managing international politics in Europe, and
it is in Europe where Wilson\'s ideas have had their greatest success
and where their prospects continue to look strongest. His ideas were
treated with bitter and cynical contempt by most European statesmen when
he first proposed them, but they later became the fundamental basis of
the European order, enshrined in the laws and practices of the EU.
Arguably, no ruler since Charlemagne has made as deep an impression on
the European political order as the much-mocked Presbyterian from the
Shenandoah Valley.

THE ARC OF HISTORY

**[Beyond Europe, the prospects for the Wilsonian order are
bleak]{.underline}**. The reasons behind its demise, however, are
different from what many assume. Critics of the Wilsonian approach to
foreign affairs often decry what they see as its idealism. In fact, as
Wilson demonstrated during the negotiations over the Treaty of
Versailles, he was perfectly capable of the most cynical realpolitik
when it suited him. The real problem of Wilsonianism is not a naive
faith in good intentions but a simplistic view of the historical
process, especially when it comes to the impact of technological
progress on human social order. Wilson\'s problem was not that he was a
prig but that he was a Whig.

Like early-twentieth-century progressives generally and many American
intellectuals to this day, Wilson was a liberal determinist of the
Anglo-Saxon school; he shared the optimism of what the scholar Herbert
Butterfield called \"the Whig historians,\" the Victorian-era British
thinkers who saw human history as a narrative of inexorable progress and
betterment. Wilson believed that the so-called ordered liberty that
characterized the Anglo-American countries had opened a path to
permanent prosperity and peace. This belief represents a sort of
Anglo-Saxon Hegelianism and holds that the mix of free markets, free
government, and the rule of law that developed in the United Kingdom and
the United States is inevitably transforming the rest of the world\--and
that as this process continues, the world will slowly and for the most
part voluntarily converge on the values that made the Anglo-Saxon world
as wealthy, attractive, and free as it has become.

Wilson was the devout son of a minister, deeply steeped in Calvinist
teachings about predestination and the utter sovereignty of God, and he
believed that the arc of progress was fated. The future would fulfill
biblical prophecies of a coming millennium: a thousand-year reign of
peace and prosperity before the final consummation of human existence,
when a returning Christ would unite heaven and earth. (Today\'s
Wilsonians have given this determinism a secular twist: in their eyes,
liberalism will rule the future and bring humanity to \"the end of
history\" as a result of human nature rather than divine purpose.)

Wilson believed that the defeat of imperial Germany in World War I and
the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman empires meant
that the hour of a universal League of Nations had finally arrived. In
1945, American leaders ranging from Eleanor Roosevelt and Henry Wallace
on the left to Wendell Willkie and Thomas Dewey on the right would
interpret the fall of Germany and Japan in much the same way. In the
early 1990s, leading U.S. foreign policymakers and commentators saw the
fall of the Soviet Union through the same deterministic prism: as a
signal that the time had come for a truly global and truly liberal world
order. On all three occasions, Wilsonian order builders seemed to be in
sight of their goal. But each time, like Ulysses, they were blown off
course by **[contrary [winds]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES

Today, those winds **[[are gaining strength]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Anyone hoping to reinvigorate the flagging Wilsonian project **[must
contend with a number of obstacles]{.underline}**. The **[[most obvious
is]{.mark} the return of [ideology-fueled
geopolitics]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[China,
Russia]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, and a number of smaller
powers]{.underline}** aligned with them\--Iran, for example\--correctly
**[see Wilsonian ideals as a deadly threat to their domestic
arrangements]{.underline}**. Earlier in the post-Cold War period, U.S.
primacy was so thorough that those countries attempted to downplay or
disguise their opposition to the prevailing pro-democracy consensus.
Beginning in U.S. President Barack Obama\'s second term, however, and
continuing through the Trump era, **[they [have become less
inhibited]{.mark}. Seeing Wilsonianism as a cover for
American]{.underline}** and, to some degree, EU **[ambitions, Beijing
and Moscow have grown increasingly bold about contesting Wilsonian ideas
and initiatives inside international institutions such as the un and on
the ground in places from Syria to the S]{.underline}**outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea.

**[[These powers\' opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the Wilsonian
order **[[is corrosive]{.underline}]{.mark}** in several ways[. **[It
raises]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[the [risks and costs]{.mark} for
Wilsonian powers to intervene in conflicts beyond their own
borders]{.underline}**. Consider, for example, how Iranian and Russian
support for the Assad regime in Syria has helped prevent the United
States and European countries from getting more directly involved in
that country\'s civil war. **[The presence of great powers in the
anti-Wilsonian coalition also provides shelter and assistance to smaller
powers that otherwise might not choose to resist the status
quo.]{.underline}** Finally, **[the membership of countries such as
China and Russia in international institutions makes it more difficult
for those institutions to operate in support of Wilsonian
norms:]{.underline}** take, for example, Chinese and Russian vetoes in
the un Security Council, the election of anti-Wilsonian representatives
to various un bodies, and the opposition by countries such as Hungary
and Poland to EU measures intended to promote the rule of law.

Meanwhile, **[the [torrent of]{.mark} technological [innovation]{.mark}
and change known as \"the information revolution\" [creates obstacles
for Wilsonian goals]{.mark} within countries and in the international
system.]{.underline}** The irony is that Wilsonians often believe that
technological progress will make the world more governable and politics
more rational\-- even if it also adds to the danger of war by making it
so much more destructive. Wilson himself believed just that, as did the
postwar order builders and the liberals who sought to extend the
U.S.-led order after the Cold War. Each time, however, this **[faith in
technological change was misplaced. As seen most recently with the rise
of the Internet, although new technologies often contribute to the
spread of liberal ideas and practices, they can also undermine
democratic systems and aid authoritarian regimes.]{.underline}**

Today, **[as new technologies disrupt entire industries, and as social
media upends the news media and election campaigning, politics is
becoming more turbulent and polarized]{.underline}** in many countries.
**[That makes the victory of populist and antiestablishment candidates
from both the left and the right more likely in many places. It also
makes it harder for national leaders to pursue the compromises that
international cooperation inevitably requires and increases the chances
that incoming governments will refuse to be bound by the acts of their
predecessors.]{.underline}**

**[The [info]{.mark}rmation [rev]{.mark}olution [is destabilizing
international]{.mark} life in other ways that make it harder for
rules-based international institutions to cope]{.underline}**. **[Take,
for example,]{.underline}** the issue of **[arms control,]{.underline}**
a central concern of Wilsonian foreign policy since World War I and one
that grew even more important following the development of nuclear
weapons. Wilsonians prioritize arms control not just because nuclear
warfare could destroy the human race but also because, even if unused,
nuclear weapons or their equivalent put the Wilsonian dream of a
completely rules-based, law-bound international order out of reach.
Weapons of mass destruction guarantee exactly the kind of state
sovereignty that Wilsonians think is incompatible with humanity\'s
long-term security. One cannot easily stage a humanitarian intervention
against a nuclear power.

The fight against proliferation has had its successes, and the spread of
nuclear weapons has been delayed\--but it has not stopped, and the fight
is getting harder over time. In the 1940s, it took the world\'s richest
nation and a consortium of leading scientists to assemble the first
nuclear weapon. Today, second- and third-rate scientific establishments
in low-income countries can manage the feat. That does not mean that the
fight against proliferation should be abandoned. It is merely a reminder
that not all diseases have cures.

What is more, the **[technological progress that underlies the
information revolution significantly exacerbates the problem of arms
control.]{.underline}** The development of cyberweapons and the
potential of biological agents to inflict strategic damage on
adversaries\--graphically demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic\--serve
as warnings that new tools of warfare will be significantly more
difficult to monitor or control than nuclear technology. Effective arms
control in these fields may well not be possible. The science is
changing too quickly, the research behind them is too hard to detect,
and too many of the key technologies cannot be banned outright because
they also have beneficial civilian applications.

In addition, **[economic incentives that did not exist in the Cold War
are now pushing arms races in new]{.underline}** fields. Nuclear weapons
and long-range missile technology were extremely expensive and brought
few benefits to the civilian economy. **[Bio]{.underline}**logical
**[and]{.underline}** **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[research]{.underline}**, by contrast, are **[critical for any country
or company that hopes to remain competitive in the twenty-first century.
An uncontrollable, multipolar arms race across a range of cutting-edge
technologies is on the horizon, and it will undercut hopes for a revived
Wilsonian order.]{.underline}**

IT\'S NOT FOR EVERYBODY

One of the central assumptions behind the quest for a Wilsonian order is
the belief that as countries develop, they become more similar to
already developed countries and will eventually converge on the liberal
capitalist model that shapes North America and western Europe. The
Wilsonian project requires a high degree of convergence to succeed; the
member states of a Wilsonian order must be democratic, and they must be
willing and able to conduct their international relations within liberal
multilateral institutions.

At least for the medium term, the **[belief in convergence can no longer
be sustained]{.underline}**. Today, **[China, India, Russia, and Turkey
all seem less likely to converge on liberal democracy than they did in
1990]{.underline}**. These countries and **[many others]{.underline}**
have **[developed economically and technologically not in order to
become more like the West but rather to achieve a deeper independence
from the West and to pursue civilizational and political goals of their
own]{.underline}**.

In truth, **[Wilsonianism is a particularly European solution to a
particularly European set of problems]{.underline}**. Since the fall of
the Roman Empire, Europe has been divided into peer and near-peer
competitors. War was the constant condition of Europe for much of its
history, and Europe\'s global dominance in the nineteenth century and
early twentieth century can be attributed in no small part to the long
contest for supremacy between France and the United Kingdom, which
promoted developments in finance, state organization, industrial
techniques, and the art of war that made European states fierce and
ferocious competitors.

With the specter of great-power war constantly hanging over them,
European states developed a more intricate system of diplomacy and
international politics than did countries in other parts of the world.
Well-developed international institutions and doctrines of legitimacy
existed in Europe well before Wilson sailed across the Atlantic to pitch
the League of Nations, which was in essence an upgraded version of
preexisting European forms of international governance. Although it
would take another devastating world war to ensure that Germany, as well
as its Western neighbors, would adhere to the rules of a new system,
Europe was already prepared for the establishment of a Wilsonian order.

But **[Europe\'s experience has not been the global norm]{.underline}**.
Although China has been periodically invaded by nomads, and there were
periods in its history when several independent Chinese states struggled
for power, China has been a single entity for most of its history. The
idea of a single legitimate state with no true international peers is as
deeply embedded in the political culture of China as the idea of a
multistate system grounded in mutual recognition is embedded in that of
Europe. There have been clashes among Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans,
but until the late nineteenth century, interstate conflict was rare.

In human history as a whole, **[enduring civilizational states seem more
typical than the European pattern of rivalry among peer
states]{.underline}**. Early modern India was dominated by the Mughal
Empire. Between the sixteenth century and the nineteenth century, the
Ottoman and Persian Empires dominated what is now known as the Middle
East. And the Incas and the Aztecs knew no true rivals in their regions.
War seems universal or nearly so among human cultures, but the European
pattern, in which an escalating cycle of war forced a mobilization and
the development of technological, political, and bureaucratic resources
to ensure the survival of the state, does not seem to have characterized
international life in the rest of the world.

For states and peoples in much of the world, the problem of modern
history that needed to be solved was not the recurrence of great-power
conflict. The problem, instead, was figuring out how to drive European
powers away, which involved a wrenching cultural and economic adjustment
in order to harness natural and industrial resources. Europe\'s
internecine quarrels struck non-Europeans not as an existential
civilizational challenge to be solved but as a welcome opportunity to
achieve independence.

Postcolonial and non-Western states often joined international
institutions as a way to recover and enhance their sovereignty, not to
surrender it, and their chief interest in international law was to
protect weak states from strong ones, not to limit the power of national
leaders to consolidate their authority. Unlike their European
counterparts, these states did not have formative political experiences
of tyrannical regimes suppressing dissent and drafting helpless
populations into the service of colonial conquest. Their experiences,
instead, involved a humiliating consciousness of the inability of local
authorities and elites to protect their subjects and citizens from the
arrogant actions and decrees of foreign powers. After colonialism
formally ended and nascent countries began to assert control over their
new territories, the classic problems of governance in the postcolonial
world remained weak states and compromised sovereignty.

**[Even within Europe, differences in historical experiences help
explain varying levels of commitment to Wilsonian ideals]{.underline}**.
Countries such as France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands came to
the EU understanding that they could meet their basic national goals
only by pooling their sovereignty. For many former Warsaw Pact members,
however, the motive for joining Western clubs such as the EU and NATO
was to regain their lost sovereignty. They did not share the feelings of
guilt and remorse over the colonial past\--and, in Germany, over the
Holocaust\--that led many in western Europe to embrace the idea of a new
approach to international affairs, and they felt no qualms about taking
full advantage of the privileges of EU and NATO membership without
feeling in any way bound by those organizations\' stated tenets, which
many regarded as hypocritical boilerplate.

EXPERT TEXPERT

The recent **[[rise of populist movements]{.mark} across the West [has

countries do? And if the Wilsonian order has become so controversial in
the West, what are its prospects in the rest of the world?

Wilson lived in an era when democratic governance faced problems that
many feared were insurmountable. The Industrial Revolution had divided
American society, creating unprecedented levels of inequality. Titanic
corporations and trusts had acquired immense political power and were
quite selfishly exploiting that power to resist all challenges to their
economic interests. At that time, the richest man in the United States,
John D. Rockefeller, had a fortune greater than the annual budget of the
federal government. By contrast, in 2020, the wealthiest American, Jeff
Bezos, had a net worth equal to about three percent of budgeted federal
expenditures.

Yet from the standpoint of Wilson and his fellow progressives, the
solution to these problems could not be simply to vest power in the
voters. At the time, most Americans still had an eighth-grade education
or less, and a wave of migration from Europe had filled the country\'s
burgeoning cities with millions of voters who could not speak English,
were often illiterate, and routinely voted for corrupt urban machine
politicians.

The progressives\' answer to this problem was to support the creation of
an apolitical expert class of managers and administrators. The
progressives sought to build an administrative state that would curb the
excessive power of the rich and redress the moral and political
deficiencies of the poor. (Prohibition was an important part of
Wilson\'s electoral program, and during World War I and afterward, he
moved aggressively to arrest and in some cases deport socialists and
other radicals.) Through measures such as improved education, strict
limits on immigration, and eugenic birth-control policies, the
progressives hoped to create better-educated and more responsible voters
who would reliably support the technocratic state.

A century later, **[elements of this progressive thinking remain
critical to Wilsonian governance in the United States and elsewhere, but
public support is less readily forthcoming than in the past. The
Internet and social media have undermined respect for all forms of
expertise]{.underline}**. Ordinary citizens today are significantly
better educated and feel less need to rely on expert guidance. And
events including the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, the 2008 financial
crisis, and the inept government responses during the 2020 pandemic have
seriously reduced confidence in experts and technocrats, whom many
people have come to see as forming a nefarious \"deep state.\"

**[International [institutions face an even greater crisis of
confidence]{.mark}. Voters skeptical of the value of technocratic
rule]{.underline}** by fellow citizens **[are even more skeptical of
foreign technocrats]{.underline}** with suspiciously cosmopolitan views.
Just as the inhabitants of European colonial territories preferred home
rule (even when badly administered) to rule by colonial civil servants
(even when competent), many **[people in the West and in the
postcolonial world are likely to reject even the best-intentioned plans
of global institutions.]{.underline}**

Meanwhile, in **[developed countries, [problems such as the loss
of]{.mark} manufacturing jobs, the [stagnation]{.mark} or [decline of
wages]{.mark}, persistent [povert]{.mark}y among minority groups, and
the opioid epidemic [have resisted]{.mark} technocratic
[solution]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. And **[when it comes to international
challenges such as climate]{.underline}** change and mass migration,
**[there is little evidence that the cumbersome institutions of global
governance and the quarrelsome countries that run them will produce the
kind of cheap]{.underline}**, elegant **[solutions that could inspire
public trust.]{.underline}**

WHAT IT MEANS FOR BIDEN

**[[For all these reasons, the movement away from the Wilsonian order is
likely]{.mark} to continue, and world politics will increasingly be
carried out along]{.underline}** non-Wilsonian and in some cases even
**[anti]{.underline}**-**[Wilsonian lines. Institutions such as
NATO]{.underline}**, the **[un]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** the
**[W]{.underline}**orld **[T]{.underline}**rade
**[Or]{.underline}**ganization **[may well survive]{.underline}**
(bureaucratic tenacity should never be discounted**[), but they will be
less able and perhaps less willing to fulfill even their original
purposes, much less take on new challenges]{.underline}**. Meanwhile,
the **[international [order will]{.mark} increasingly [be shaped by
states]{.mark} that are [on diverging paths]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This
does not mean an inevitable future of civilizational clashes, but it
does mean that **[global institutions will have to accommodate a much
wider range of views and values than they have in the
past.]{.underline}**

There is hope that many of the gains of the Wilsonian order can be
preserved and perhaps in a few areas even extended. But fixating on past
glories will not help develop the ideas and policies needed in an
increasingly dangerous time. Non-Wilsonian orders have existed both in
Europe and in other parts of the world in the past, and the nations of
the world will likely need to draw on these examples as they seek to
cobble together some kind of framework for stability and, if possible,
peace under contemporary conditions.

For U.S. policymakers, the developing crisis of the Wilsonian order
worldwide presents vexing problems that are likely to preoccupy
presidential administrations for decades to come. One problem is that
many career officials and powerful voices in Congress, civil society
organizations, and the press deeply believe not only that a Wilsonian
foreign policy is a good and useful thing for the United States but also
that it is the only path to peace and security and even to the survival
of civilization and humanity. They will continue to fight for their
cause, conducting trench warfare inside the bureaucracy and employing
congressional oversight powers and steady leaks to sympathetic press
outlets to keep the flame alive.

Those factions will be hemmed in by the fact that any internationalist
coalition in American foreign policy must rely to a significant degree
on Wilsonian voters. **[But a generation of overreach and poor political
judgment has significantly reduced the credibility of Wilsonian ideas
among the American electorate]{.underline}**. Neither President George
W. Bush\'s nation-building disaster in Iraq nor Obama\'s
humanitarian-intervention fiasco in Libya struck most Americans as
successful, and there is little public enthusiasm for democracy building
abroad.

**[Concerns about the security implications of China's rise are
not]{.underline}** particularly **[justified]{.underline}**. Moreover,
**[[China faces many problem]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. As Freeman puts
it, "**[China has its hands full]{.underline}**." Among the problems:
"**[[environmental devastation, slowing growth]{.mark}, a rapidly [aging
population and shrinking labor force]{.mark}, enormous levels of
industrial [overproduction]{.mark}, [accumulating]{.mark} local
[debt,]{.mark} a still‐​[inadequate social safety network, and]{.mark} an
increasingly [oppressive political system]{.mark}....]{.underline}** It
has an unfinished civil war with Taiwan and uneasy relations with
fifty‐​five ethnic minority groups---8½ percent of its population---at
least two of which are in a near state of rebellion."79

**[Although China might eventually be able to handle these and other
problems, [they will arrest the attention of its leaders for a long
time]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And, in total, **[they might be taken to
suggest that descent or at least prolonged stagnation might come about,
rather than a continued rise.]{.underline}**

Even though the Western mainstream view is that China is a military and
economic dynamo that is quickly leaving America behind, **[the world may
be turning against the Middle Kingdom, and Chinese leadership may be
turning to a harsh brand of nationalism as a result.]{.underline}** Its
recent border clash with India in the high Himalayas and crackdown on
free Hong Kong are the most recent manifestations of this. China\'s rise
as a global economic power, and regional military power, is one of the
fastest in history. China has grown faster than America for four
straight decades. It has built the industrial and technological
foundations for a rapid expansion of its military, to include
world-class capabilities in space launch, and its own version of GPS.
China\'s mercantilist economics have taken over entire sectors of other
economies, including those of the United States. All this has
occurred not just with U.S. acquiescence, but intentional facilitation.
America first wanted China as a counterweight to Soviet Russia, and then
aggressively helped China to get rich, with the expectation that
self-government and democracy would follow in the Middle Kingdom. But
**[the times may be-a-changin'. [China\'s population
]{.mark}]{.underline}**is **[[aging]{.mark} at a rate and scale that
[is]{.mark} historically [unprecedented.]{.mark} That nation is expected
to lose 400 million working age persons this century, and the number is
already falling]{.underline}**. There is an 18 percent gender imbalance
in the country\'s population. **[China\'s birth rate never recovered
from its multi-decade \"one child\" policy.]{.underline}** India will
likely pass China as the world\'s most populous country this decade.
**[China has just backed off publishing its economic growth goal for the
first time in decades.]{.underline}** China is bullying South Korean and
Japanese companies. Samsung and Sony are scaling back their operations
in the People\'s Republic. **[Apple]{.underline}** is a laggard, but
**[is planning to move]{.underline}** 20 percent of its Chinese
supply-chain presence **[to India.]{.underline}** India banned
fifty-nine Chinese mobile apps after the above-mentioned border clash.
Huawei has found itself on the Trump administration\'s blacklist, and
its loss of Google on its smartphones has badly damaged sales outside
China. The UK has announced plans for Huawei\'s complete removal from
British telecom infrastructure by 2023. **[China\'s [export markets are
flat]{.mark} on their backs, and furious at China about the
coronavirus.]{.underline}** Europe is 16 percent of China\'s exports,
and is an economic and financial wreck. America is 19 percent, the Trump
attitude towards China is no secret, and those views are gaining steam
with both parties on Capitol Hill. **[Chinese exports to America are
falling rapidly]{.underline}**, down 17 percent from the summer 2018 to
January 2020. **[This will be dramatically [accelerated by
corona]{.mark}virus[.]{.mark} No one thought this economic decoupling
could happen so fast. Chinese global direct foreign investment is also
down from \$260 billion in 2017 to \$125 billion in 2019. Why would
China be easing up now on its Belt and Road Initiative?]{.underline}**
On the military side, **[China\'s geographic circumstances can only be
described as bottled up and vulnerable.]{.underline}** China is almost
surrounded by countries that are unfriendly. It only has one ally, North
Korea, which is more of a client state. **[[Japan]{.mark},
[So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea, [Taiwan,]{.mark} Vietnam, Australia, and
[India]{.mark} are all on the spectrum from cool to hostile towards
China. Most [are allies]{.mark} or friendly [with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates. Many are [armed with]{.mark} American [high-tech
weapons. To]{.mark} actually [control the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea[, China]{.mark} would [need]{.mark} to control both
[Subic]{.mark} Bay [and Cam Rahn Bay.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[China]{.underline}** **[[is zero percent]{.mark} of the way
[there.]{.mark} The Philippines just reversed course on its threat to
abrogate their Visiting Forces Agreement]{.underline}** with the United
States. Every South China Sea nation\'s maritime territory is blatantly
infringed upon by the PRC\'s \"Nine Dash Line\" claims. This is not how
to make friends. The America-India courtship is going well. **[China and
Russia are temporary friends of convenience]{.underline}**. Russia is
strapped for cash, and the quality and quantity of its defense exports
are mostly sub-par. **[[The]{.mark} Chinese [defense industry]{.mark}
mainly [builds Russian knock-offs.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Russia is good
at making fighters and air defense, but not much else. China\'s
**[[commercial aircraft are]{.mark} immature, and are [not
worthy]{.mark} of being considered for aerial [refueling
platforms.]{.mark}]{.underline}** There is not much north or west of
China, and it is not a good working alliance with Russia. Their power
centers are a giant continent apart, and Russia\'s center of gravity has
always been in Europe. Russia has never been able to project power
effectively in her far east. This is not a good long-term symbiotic
relationship. In order to secure her trade, China must project power
from the Yangtze basin and Yellow Sea into the East China Sea. Waiting
there are three potential adversaries with sophisticated Western
militaries: South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan. Four if you want to count
the United States. South Korea and Japan have great force generation
land-based aircraft in Strike Eagles (F-15s) and Joint Strike Fighters
(F-35s). Taiwan is getting lethal F-16 Vipers with AESA radars. There
are 28,000 American troops on South Korean soil. **[China has no
nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and its conventional carriers are
clunkers.]{.underline}** Chinese land-based Flankers are much better
than their carrier aircraft. **[The]{.underline}** carrier-based J-15
**[Flanker]{.underline}**, based on the Russian Su-33, **[is a bit of a
joke. They cannot take off with full ordnance and fuel.]{.underline}**
Chinese press openly criticizes the J-15. They are 70,000-plus pound
fighters taking off from a ski ramp with an obsolete carrier launch and
retrieve system. **[The Chinese [carriers are]{.mark} powered by
[old-fashioned]{.mark} oil-fired [boilers.]{.mark} Chinese
[bombers]{.mark}]{.underline}** are based on old Soviet-designed Tu-16
Badgers. They are more accurately described as \"medium\" bombers, as
opposed to their \"strategic\" long-range American counterparts. Though
recent models feature upgrades, these H-6 bombers **[[are not
ready]{.mark} to go toe-to-toe [with Western air defenses]{.mark} or air
superiority fighters[. A move]{.mark} to serious American-type power
projection [would]{.mark} [bankrupt a Chinese economy]{.mark} that is
already in trouble[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The scary power projection
incentive or scenario for China is just not there. The eastern side of
the first island chain is the wrong side for China. There China will
find swarms of fourth and fifth generation land and sea-based fighters.
**[Taiwan has an impressive military buildup underway. [Taiwan
has]{.mark} lots of [airfields, rapid runway repair]{.mark}
capabilities[, and can maintain]{.mark} a high level of [tactical
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} [even after a
bombardment.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Even the west side of the first
island chain is a nasty problem set for China. **[Whether it is superior
allied tactical aircraft or American attack submarines, it will have its
hands full in a battle it might not win.]{.underline}** **[[China needs
markets in Europe]{.mark}, oil from [the Persian Gulf]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} resources in [Africa]{.mark}. All three of those are
[easily held hostage by the U.S. Navy alone]{.mark}]{.underline}**, not
to mention the naval capabilities held by American friends and allies
along the Asian littoral. The Chinese economy would collapse within
weeks without Persian Gulf oil. **[China\'s military [challenges may not
be surmountable]{.mark}, maybe [for decades.]{.mark} Geography is just
too hard for China]{.underline}**.

#### Corruption limits China's rise---undermines its economy

**[Mueller, Ohio State Adjunct Professor, '21]{.underline}**

\[John Mueller, Adjunct Professor, Political Science, Ohio State

Andrew Wedeman, a prominent student of the issue who heads the China
Studies Program at Georgia State University, suggests that, **[in all,
"[corruption may]{.mark} be an i[ntractab]{.mark}le problem" as long as
"people remain subject to temptation, and conditions and incentives make
it possible and profitable to ignore regulations, accept
bribes]{.underline}** to expedite projects, or in other ways pursue
acceptable goals through unsanctioned means." Moreover, "**[[it has the
potential to erode public confidence in the regime and the legitimacy of
party rule" even as it "tarnishes China's image abroad and]{.mark}
sometimes distorts and [impedes efforts to meet critical
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}**." His essay on the subject is
provocatively titled "Anticorruption Forever?"89

In his study of China's crony capitalism, economist Minxin Pei argues
that the process not only wastes "precious resources that could have
been invested more productively" but also diverts energies and talents
into sectors "that are unlikely to be the growth engines needed to
upgrade the Chinese economy." **[[The result]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he
suggests**[, is likely to be "long‐​term economic
stagnation]{.underline}**."90

#### China's power is limited---belligerence is driving our foreign investment and technology

**[Mueller, Ohio State Adjunct Professor, '21]{.underline}**

\[John Mueller, Adjunct Professor, Political Science, Ohio State
University and Senior Fellow, Cato Institute, "China: Rise or Demise?"

Fingar and **[[Oi point]{.mark} to another [development that "bodes ill
for China's future": it has alienated foreign]{.mark}
firms]{.underline}**. It has done so **[[by stealing]{.mark}
[i]{.mark}ntellectual [p]{.mark}roperty, demanding
transfers]{.underline}** of technology as a condition for operating in
China, **[[and "]{.mark}generally [failing to honor
contracts]{.mark}]{.underline}** and trade commitments." As a result,
they note, rath**[er than building facilities in China, [foreign
companies have increasingly sought better
opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}** in other countries.119 Notes Doug
Bandow, "**[Even corporate America]{.underline}**, long the strongest
supporter of the Sino‐​American relationship, **[has grown
frustrated]{.underline}**, viewing the Chinese market as almost
irredeemably biased against foreign firms."120

Meanwhile, **[[China's authoritarian crackdown in Hong
Kong]{.mark},]{.underline}** a region that once sported an attractive
openness and a court system that was not corrupt, is **[[scarcely likely
to encourage international]{.mark} confidence and
[investment]{.mark}]{.underline}**.121 Transparency International
routinely ranks countries for perceived corruption. Its rankings from
least to most for 179 countries in 2019 found that for what might be
called "Chinese entities," Singapore ranked at 4, Hong Kong at 16,
Taiwan at 28, and China at 80. (The United States, for comparison, ranks
at 23.) The Hong Kong ranking seems likely to change. And that could
have substantial economic consequences. As one business executive puts
it, "Businesses will inevitably change their perceptions of Hong Kong as
a gateway to China that is protected by rule of law.... There will be
foreign companies that say 'we'll just enter China directly, I've got no
one‐​up going via Hong Kong,' or they'll just exit China completely."122

**[The new national security law is unlikely to charm
foreigners]{.underline}**---including those in the vast Chinese
diaspora---because China has applied it to anyone living anywhere on the
planet. Thus, it appears that foreigners who, for example, call for
independence for Hong Kong or advocate sanctions against China are
subject to arrest and life imprisonment if the Chinese government can
get its hands on them.123

### China Ans: Threat---1NC

#### China is not a trheat---multiple reasons

6-12-22\]

However, even if it continues to rise, **[[China does not
present]{.underline}]{.mark}** much of **[[a security
threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the United States. **[[China does not
harbor]{.mark}]{.underline}** Hitler‐​style **[[ambitions of extensive
conquest]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
Chinese government **[[depends on the world economy for development and
the consequent acquiescence of the Chinese people. Armed conflict would
be extremely]{.underline}]{.mark}**---even overwhelmingly---**[[costly
t]{.underline}]{.mark}**o the country and, in particular, to the regime
in charge. Indeed, **[[there is a danger of making China into a threat
by treating it as such and by engaging in so‐​called balancing efforts
against it]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Rather than rising to anything that could be conceived to be
"dominance," **[[China could decline into substantial economic
stagnation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[It faces many problems,
including]{.underline}]{.mark}** endemic (and perhaps intractable)
**[[corruption, environmental devastation,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[slowing growth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a rapidly **[[aging
population]{.underline}]{.mark}**, enormous
**[[overproduction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, increasing **[[debt, and
restive minorities]{.underline}]{.mark}** in its west and in Hong Kong.
At a time when it should be liberalizing its economy, Xi Jinping's China
increasingly restricts speech and privileges control by the antiquated
and kleptocratic Communist Party over economic growth. And entrenched
**[[elites are well placed to block reform.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

That said, China's standard of living is now the highest in its history,
and it's very easy to envision conditions that are a great deal worse
than life under a stable, if increasingly authoritarian, kleptocracy. As
a result, the Chinese people may be willing to ride with, and ride out,
economic stagnation should that come about---although this might be
accompanied by increasing dismay and disgruntlement.

In either case---rise or demise---there is little the United States or
other countries can or should do to affect China's economically foolish
authoritarian drive except to issue declarations of disapproval and to
deal more warily. As former ambassador Chas Freeman puts it, "There is
no military answer to a grand strategy built on a non‐​violent expansion
of commerce and navigation." And **[[Chinese leaders have plenty of
problems to consume their attention. They scarcely need
war]{.mark}]{.underline}** or foreign military adventurism to enhance
the mix.

The problem is not so much that China is a threat but that it is deeply
insecure. Policies of threat, balance, sanction, boycott, and critique
are more likely to reinforce that condition than change it. The
alternative is to wait, and to profit from China's economic size to the
degree possible, until someday China feels secure enough to reform
itself.

\*\*edited for language

The **[[current concern about China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the
hostility toward it, **[[are sometimes said to constitute "a new Cold
War]{.mark}." [There are]{.mark}]{.underline}**, of course,
**[[considerable differences]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In particular,
during the Cold War, the Soviet Union---indeed the whole international
Communist movement---was under the sway of a Marxist theory that
explicitly and determinedly advocated the destruction of capitalism and
probably of democracy, by revolutionary violence if necessary.
**[[China]{.mark} today [does not harbor]{.mark}]{.underline}** such
**[[cosmic goals, nor is it enamored of]{.underline}]{.mark}** such
**[[destructive methods]{.underline}]{.mark}**.214

However, the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[was strongly inclined]{.mark}
during the Cold War [to massively inflate the
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** it imagined the Communist adversary to
present, particularly militarily.215 **[The current "[new Cold War"

Indeed, **[[there is a danger of making China into a threat by treating
it as such,]{.underline}]{.mark}** by refusing to consider the
unlikelihood as well as the consequences of worst‐​case‐​scenario
fantasizing, **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** by engaging in endless
metaphysical talk about **[[rejuggling military hardware to somehow
"balance" against China.]{.underline}]{.mark}** In this respect, special
consideration should be given to the observation that, as China expert
Susan Shirk notes, provocative **[[balancing
talk,]{.underline}]{.mark}** especially if military showmanship
accompanies it, **[[has the potential to be wildly
counterproductive:]{.underline}]{.mark}** "historically, ri**[[sing
powers cause war not necessarily because they are innately belligerent,
but because the reigning powers mishandle those who challenge the status
quo]{.underline}]{.mark}**."36

Similarly, Columbia University's Richard Betts warns: "No evidence
suggests that Chinese leaders will have an interest in naked
conquest.... The most likely danger lies in the situation in which
action China sees as defensive and legitimate appears aggressive to
Washington."37 "Unfortunately," observes China scholar Thomas
Christensen, "exaggerated rhetoric" from the United States has
"seemingly confirmed nationalist Chinese narratives about U.S. efforts
to encircle and contain China."38 Historian Odd Arne Westad points out
that China continually complains that "the United States is planning to
undermine China's rise through external aggression and internal
subversion."39 And after going over hundreds of relevant
Chinese‐​language articles, Lyle Goldstein, research professor in the
China Maritime Studies Institute at the U.S. Naval War College, finds "a
plainly evident common theme." **[[Chinese specialists "are convinced
that Washington seeks to contain and even derail China's

**[The international system]{.underline}**, which can be defined as the
western-backed liberal system that has existed since the end of World
War II, **[is being impacted in subtle ways due to China's
rise]{.underline}**. China\'s rise will harm the current western-backed
international system because China has utilized its newfound strength
the erode the liberal norms and values which the system is based on.
China has looked for ways to contribute to the international system
while altering the system to suit its ideals of non-intervention in the
domestic affairs of sovereign nations. China has used its growing
influence to curtail and limit attempts by the international system to
deal with a variety of issues, including human rights. It has also
looked for ways to undermine the Washington Consensus, which advocates
for political and economic reforms in nations, for its own Beijing
Consensus that only focuses on the economic growth of nations. This new
concept has further undermined the norms and values of the international
system as other nations can look for aid and funding from an alternative
source which is not as concerned about social and political reforms such
as environmental protections, anti-corruption measures, and human
rights. **[However, [the international system is]{.mark} still
principally [controlled by]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[Western powers
of [the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[and the]{.underline}**

over the last several decades, also **[[means]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}
international [system has a]{.mark} loyal [following]{.mark} of
supporters committed to its maintenance and continuance]{.underline}**.
**[China\'s rise will allow it greater power]{.underline}** and
flexibility to allow it to alter the international system along the
edges. **[However, [over]{.mark}all]{.underline}**, **[[the rise]{.mark}
of China [will have a limited]{.mark} adverse
[impact]{.mark}]{.underline}** on the international system **[as China
alters the system]{.underline}** **[[around the
edges]{.underline}]{.mark}** by looking for ways to erode the values and
norms, such as human rights and democracy, using its influence. However,
**[[it will not be a severe threat]{.mark} to the existing global order
or its institutions because [it has an interest in maintaining the
s]{.mark}tatus [quo and does not have the power to alter it]{.mark}
drastically.]{.underline}**

**[In conclusion, [China's rise will have a limited negative
impact]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[on the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, China's regional
neighbors, and the international system. **[[These]{.mark} impacts
[include]{.mark} unfair economic [trade practices]{.mark}]{.underline}**
that hurt the United States and **[other nations around the world while
continuing to fund its rise]{.underline}**. This **[economic growth
enables China to increasingly challenge the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and bully its regional
neighbors in pursuit of China's national interests and the growing
ability to withstand diplomatic pressure attempting to China's bad
behavior, such as its aggressive actions **[in the]{.underline}**
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
and flagrant violations of human rights. China also uses this economic
power to pressure other nations, fearful of economic repercussions, into
altering key aspects of the **[international]{.underline}** system to
better suit China's interests and condone bad behavior.
**[However]{.underline}**, **[the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[China's
neighbors]{.underline}**, **[and the international community have the
power to limit and]{.underline}** **[roll back]{.underline}** **[these
short-term negative effects. Policymakers]{.underline}** and scholars
**[are becoming increasingly aware that China is actively trying to
alter the global order to suit its national interests and cannot be
ignored]{.underline}**. China's current capabilities may not allow it to
pursue its national interests aggressively, but if its capabilities
increase, it will most likely change its behavior and show different
motives. The United States and international community can continue to
work constructively with China on a variety of issues of mutual interest
such as counterterrorism and North Korea. However, they can no longer be
afraid to push back against China's actions. The top priorities should
target China's main source of power, its economy, by forcing China to
end its long-standing unfair trade practices. It should also enforce the
international norms and standards that the international system claims
to stand by publicly calling out China for any of its offenses. Working
constructively with China should not mean giving in to China's demands
as it so frequently has in the past. Now is the time for the United
States and the international community to create a united front to
firmly reject when China oversteps while the US and the international
community have the upper hand.

### China Ans: Threat---Authoritarianism

#### China not exporting autho---split motives

**[Wong '21]{.underline}** \[Audrye Wong, "How to Not Win Allies and
Influence Geopolitics: China's Self-Defeating Economic Statecraft,"

accessed 9-21-21\]

What does China want to do with all this newfound economic power? **[The
opacity of China's political system leads many to ascribe its behavior
to a centralized decision-making process pursuing a coherent grand
strategy, but [Chinese policies are]{.mark} in fact often the [product
of]{.mark} competition and [compromise among a tangle of
actors]{.mark}]{.underline}**---local governments, high-level
bureaucracies, state-owned enterprises, private firms, and more.
Consider the BRI. What began as a vague and sprawling plan has taken on
a life of its own, at times hijacked by opportunistic government
officials and companies seeking to feather their own nests. **[Many of
the constituent [projects are motivated less by]{.mark} some grand
[strategic blueprint than by]{.mark} the [preferences of individual
actors]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Another [error]{.mark} is [to assume]{.mark} that [China's actions
are]{.mark} driven by a desire [to export its]{.mark} own autocratic
[political system]{.mark}]{.underline}** and statist economic system.
True, Xi has grown increasingly repressive at home and assertive abroad,
but **[[China is]{.mark} still [preoccupied]{.mark} more [with
safeguarding its]{.mark} own [interests]{.mark} than with trying to
remake other countries in its own image.]{.underline}** Even though
China seeks to reshape the international system to reflect its
priorities, that is a far cry from trying to overturn the order
altogether.

**[[What]{.mark} really [drives China's]{.mark} economic [statecraft
is]{.mark} not grand strategic designs or autocratic impulses but
something more practical and immediate: [stability and
survival]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The **[C]{.underline}**hinese
**[C]{.underline}**ommunist **[P]{.underline}**arty**['s]{.underline}**
**[fundamental objective is to preserve the legitimacy of its
rule.]{.underline}**

**[China's economic statecraft, then, is often employed to put out
immediate fires and protect the CCP's domestic and international
image.]{.underline}** China wants to stamp out criticism and reward
those who support its policies. This is particularly true when it comes
to issues involving national sovereignty and territorial integrity (such
as Taiwan, Tibet, and the East China and South China Seas) and domestic
governance (such as China's treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang and its
handling of the covid-19 pandemic).

### China Ans: Threat---Cyber Espionage

**[International [spying and stealing have been standard
forever]{.mark}, and [they are likely to become]{.mark} ever [more
extensive as]{.mark} the [relevant]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology
[improves]{.mark}. That is,]{.underline}** as Hanania puts it, "**[most
of the indictment against China involves things that every country
does."]{.underline}**69 As Johnston points out, "the United States has
been the only major power to make a clear, normative distinction between
the legitimacy of cyber‐​enabled political‐​military espionage and the
illegitimacy of cyber‐​enabled commercial espionage."
**[[China,]{.underline}]{.mark}** then, **[[is following "the dominant
behavioral norm on cyber]{.mark} commercial [espionage,]{.mark}" and [it
is the]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[that is the
outlier]{.underline}]{.mark}**. He also notes that American businesses
in China find forced technology transfers to be much less of a problem
than issues like the lack of transparency in the Chinese regulatory
system.70

From time to time, China may be emboldened to throw its weight around in
its presumed area of influence. Such weight‐​throwing is unpleasant to
watch as well as counterproductive to China's economic goals to the
degree that it inspires hostility in the region, making the neighbors
wary and pushing them closer to the United States.32 But, as even
Friedberg and Walt acknowledge, **[[China does not seem to harbor
extensive conquest ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.33

Above all, **[[China has become]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost **[[the
quintessential trading state]{.underline}]{.mark}**.34 **[[Its
integration into the world economy and its increasing dependence on it
for economic development and the consequent acquiescence of the Chinese
people are crucial. Armed conflict would be
extremely---]{.underline}]{.mark}**even overwhelmingly---**[[costly
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the country and especially to **[[the
regime]{.underline}]{.mark}** in charge. And **[[Chinese leaders seem to
realize thi]{.underline}]{.mark}**s. As Bell puts it, "**[[there is
little reason to think that the country has any interest in seriously
damaging the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, **[[its largest trading
partner]{.underline}]{.mark}** and debtor."35 The best bet is that this
condition will essentially hold.

**[The question is whether [China]{.mark} would [risk losing its]{.mark}
achievements and recognition of being part of]{.underline}** the
**[[international leadership]{.mark} for a relevant 'domestic' matter of
geographical territory. The answer can be found in history. [Waging war

**[[power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Conflicts do not bring
**[progress]{.underline}** and **[prosperity and certainly not a
leadership role for]{.underline}** the **[countries leading their
nations to destruction]{.underline}** and human losses. Europe has
inexorably withdrawn from being an important geopolitical and military
global leader after initiating and staging two World Wars. History has
also taught us that the moral quality of leadership is the most
qualified reassurance that discourages wars. **[In the age of
nuclear]{.underline}** powers such as **[China and]{.underline}** the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, the
**[[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}** of a conflict will be
devastating for humanity, and they **[[will be worse for]{.mark}
the]{.underline}** ideal process of **[progress]{.underline}** and
**[[advancement]{.mark} of the involved nation]{.underline}**s. **[As
far as China is concerned]{.underline}**, as Chan argues,
**[[all]{.mark} the previously mentioned [risks and weaknesses
suggest]{.mark}]{.underline}** that **[the current [Chinese strategy
does not seem to be one of a rising world hegemon
but]{.mark}]{.underline}** that of **[a strong country searching
for]{.underline}** **[[a regional]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Asian)

achievement of the 'harmonious' and **[[peaceful]{.mark} global
[order]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[The fact that the entire idea of a
'Great China' is built on the fundamental assumption that only a world
at peace can bring prosperity for]{.underline}** the Chinese nation and
give recognition to **[China]{.underline}** as an important power in

kind of **[conflict that affects [international]{.mark}]{.underline}**

long-term consolidation of the socio-econ]{.underline}]{.mark}**omic
**[[results achieved by China]{.mark} in recent years. This awareness of
the need for peace]{.underline}** and harmony **[guides Chinese
leaders]{.underline}**hip **[in pursuing consistent
policies]{.underline}** **[in domestic and international affairs.
Achieving this goal requires]{.underline}** 'orderliness',
**[that]{.underline}** is, national and **[international order must be
maintained]{.underline}** **[and protected.]{.underline}**

### China Ans: Threat---Liberal Order

#### There is no need to contain China, and it will buy into the global order

**[Mueller, Ohio State Adjunct Professor, '21]{.underline}**

\[John Mueller, Adjunct Professor, Political Science, Ohio State
University and Senior Fellow, Cato Institute, "China: Rise or Demise?"
POLICY ANALYSIS n. 917, 5---18---21,
<https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/china-rise-or-demise>, accessed
6-12-22\]

It certainly seems that, although China may present some challenges to
U.S. policy as it continues to grow, **[[there is little to suggest a
need to balance against or contain China]{.mark}---particularly through
military means---to keep it in line]{.underline}**. In fact, **[the
chief problem may not stem from China's quest for
influence,]{.underline}** as Washington's alarmists would have it,
**[but from the fact that a kleptocratic and increasingly authoritarian
China may be descending into stagnation]{.underline}** or perhaps even
into something like demise. That's, of course, not good news for China;
but it is also not necessarily good news for the United States or the
rest of the world either. Indeed, in 2016, President Barack Obama
suggested that "we have more to fear from a weakened, threatened China
than a successful, rising China."180

As for the challenges provided by China, an observation by Chas Freeman
is pertinent. He stresses that "**[China's rise is a
real]{.underline}**, not imaginary, challenge to the status quo and to
U.S. leadership" **[but]{.underline}** adds that **[the rise "is mainly
economic]{.underline}**, not military **[and it can be peaceful or not,
as our interaction with it determines." [China]{.mark} does not seem to
have territorial ambitions]{.underline}** (beyond integrating Taiwan at
some point), **[and it [does not have the wherewithal or]{.mark}, it
seems, the [ambition, to "run the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} As Freeman continues,
"**[History has given the Chinese a healthy apprehension about the
damage war can do to their homeland]{.underline}**. China is not in
search of monsters to destroy beyond its still partially unsettled
borders."181 Fingar concludes that **[although [China]{.mark} expects to
play a more influential role in shaping the global order, "it [does
no]{.mark}t (yet) [aspire to lead]{.mark} it]{.underline}**."182 Or as
Fu Ying, chairperson of the Foreign Affairs Committee of China's
National People's Congress, puts it more bluntly, "**[Ch[ina views the
U.S.-dominated world order as a mess and this is why it does not want to
take over.]{.mark} Why should China repeat the mistakes which the U.S.
did]{.underline}**?"183

The Cato Institute's Colin Grabow suggests that **[[China may]{.mark}
eventually [become "the responsible stakeholder that many have long
urged]{.mark}]{.underline}** it to be." At any rate, "**[rather than
reflexively viewing China's economic initiatives as an affront to U.S.
interests," [efforts should be made to "harness China's]{.mark} emerging
[taste for]{.mark} global [economic
leadership]{.mark}]{.underline}**[."]{.mark} And through cooperation,
the two countries "could become successful partners in the promotion of
trade and prosperity."184 This seems a sensible course even if it might
entail scaling back American claims to "leadership" in China's
neighborhood and ceding some of that role (such as it is) to Beijing.185

### China Ans: Threat---Spheres of Influence Ans

#### Spheres of influence arguments are bunk

**[Mueller, Ohio State Adjunct Professor, '21]{.underline}**

\[John Mueller, Adjunct Professor, Political Science, Ohio State
University and Senior Fellow, Cato Institute, "China: Rise or Demise?"
POLICY ANALYSIS n. 917, 5---18---21,
<https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/china-rise-or-demise>, accessed
6-12-22\]

Many **[commentators have raised concerns about China's]{.underline}**
often‐​expressed **[desire to have more "influence"]{.underline}** in the
world. They point, in particular, to an elaborate Chinese scheme---the
Belt and Road Initiative---to establish sea and land lanes to maintain
and enhance China's ability to trade with the rest of the world.
Unsurprisingly, **[many]{.underline}** in the United States **[envision
this as a key part of a diabolical plot by the Chinese to "rule the
world]{.underline}**."46

However, **[[it is absurd to obsess over something like the
vacuous]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if venerable, [**[sphere of influence
concept]{.underline}**. **[The notion that world affairs are a process
in which countries scamper around the world seeking to establish spheres
of influence is]{.underline}**]{.mark} at best decidedly **[[unhelpful
and]{.underline}]{.mark}** at worst [**[utterly
misguided]{.underline}**.]{.mark}47 But the concept continues to be
embraced in some quarters as if it had some palpable meaning. For
example, in 2017, the National Intelligence Council opined that
"geopolitical competition is on the rise as China and Russia seek to
exert more sway over their neighboring regions and promote an order in
which U.S. influence does not dominate."48

However, **[[it is difficult to see whether American "influence" could
be said to "dominate" anywhere]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, on
December 21, 2017, when the United States sought to alter the status of
Jerusalem, the United Nations General Assembly repudiated the U.S. stand
in a nearly unanimous vote that included many U.S. allies. That's
influence?49 Indeed, it is impressive that the hegemon, endowed with
what Reich and Lebow aptly call a grossly disproportionate military
capacity, has had such a miserable record of military achievement since
1945.50 **[The [militarized application of American primacy]{.mark} and
hegemony [to order the world has often been a
fiasco]{.mark}]{.underline}**.51

### China Ans: Threat---Tech

#### No impact to emerging tech.

are]{.mark} [risks to]{.mark} an [overestimation of]{.mark} the rate of
[tech]{.mark}nological change and the role of advanced tech [in]{.mark}
future [victory]{.mark}. In spite of many exciting technological
developments, [history and data suggest]{.mark} that [we are]{.mark}
probably [in an evolutionary rather than revolutionary
period.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[at least since the
beginning of the modern age [tech]{.mark}nological overmatch [has been
neither necessary nor sufficient for victory, and is]{.mark} about as
predictive as a coin toss.]{.underline}**

**[In its]{.underline}** understandable **[zeal for technological
advantage, the military should remember enduring truths about
warfare.]{.underline}** The nuance of force employment is key to any
battle, and **[an [over-emphasis on]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology risks
[allow]{.mark}ing [blind spots that]{.mark} our future
[adversaries]{.mark} will be sure to [exploit]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Though we should certainly strive for cutting edge technology, if that
pursuit comes at the expense of force employment investments, we may be
unknowingly entrusting future success to little more than a coin toss.

Yet **[the [history of tech]{.mark}nological revolutions [counsels
against alarmism]{.mark}. Extrapolating from current technological
trends is problematic]{.underline}**, both **[because
[tech]{.mark}nologies often [do not live up to]{.mark} their
[promise]{.mark}, and because technologies often have countervailing or
conditional effects that can temper their]{.underline}** negative
**[consequences]{.underline}**. Thus, the fear that emerging
technologies will necessarily cause sudden and spectacular changes to
international politics should be treated with caution. There are at
least two reasons to be circumspect.

First, **[[very few]{.mark} technologies fundamentally [reshape]{.mark}
the dynamics of international [conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Historically, **[[most]{.mark} technological innovations have
[amount]{.mark}ed [to incremental advancements, and some]{.mark} have
[disappeared into irrelevance]{.mark} despite widespread
hype]{.underline}** about their promise. For example, the introduction
of chemical weapons was widely expected to immediately change the nature
of warfare and deterrence after the British army first used poison gas
on the battlefield during World War I. Yet **[chemical weapons quickly
turned out to be less practical, easier to counter, and less effective
than conventional high-explosives]{.underline}** in inflicting damage
and disrupting enemy operations.6 Other technologies have become
important only after advancements in other areas allowed them to reach
their full potential: **[until armies developed tactics for effectively
employing firearms]{.underline}**, for instance, **[these weapons had
little effect on the balance of power.]{.underline}** And even **[when
technologies do have significant strategic consequences, they often take
decades to emerge]{.underline}**, as the invention of airplanes and
tanks illustrates. In short, it is easy to exaggerate the strategic
effects of nascent technologies.7

**[Second, even if today's emerging [tech]{.mark}nologies are poised to
drive important changes]{.underline}** in the international system,
**[they are likely to [have]{.mark} variegated and even [contradictory
effects]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Technologies may be destabilising under
some conditions, but stabilising in others. Furthermore, **[[other
factors]{.mark} are likely to [mediate]{.mark} the [effects]{.mark} of
new technologies on the international system, [including
geography]{.mark}, the [distribution of]{.mark} material [power]{.mark},
military [strategy]{.mark}, domestic and organisational
[politics]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [social and cultural
variables]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to name only a few.8 Consequently, the
strategic effects of new technologies often defy simple classification.
Indeed, more than 70 years after nuclear weapons emerged as a new
technology, their consequences for stability continue to be debated.9

### China Ans: Threat---A2 "Revisionist"

**[Not Ready to Overhaul the World Order]{.underline}** To some
observers, Beijing is positioned to overhaul the world order. **[Warning
about a 'collision between geo-economics and geopolitics', a harbinger
of battles to come, one Western observer worried that the global system
would not survive the rising competition between the US and
China]{.underline}**. 38 A Singaporean scholar predicted China's
victory, heralding the end of the American century and the arrival of
the Asian century. 39 A Chinese scholar claimed that the UK, the US, and
China represented three superpowers of yesterday, today, and tomorrow,
respectively. The UK as the first modern superpower left rich Anglo-
Saxon legacies of global governance. The US replaced the UK after World
War II, starting Pax - Americana . Relying on the Bretton Woods System,
NATO and so-called universal values, the US was determined to hold on to
global dominance. China has to find an alternative path ( 另辟蹊径 ) to
defend its national interests. 40 **[But China is not
ready]{.underline}**. First, as one Chinese scholar admitted, '**[[China
does not have the]{.mark} comprehensive national [strength to change
the]{.mark} current [global order]{.mark} led by the US and other
Western countries for more than 70 years'[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** 41 A
fragile rising power much **[weaker than most outsiders
think,]{.underline}** **[China is a middle-income country, facing
[immense internal hurdles]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark} the [environmental
destruction,]{.mark} rampant [corruption, inequality, and]{.mark} huge
local government [debt]{.mark}]{.underline}**, all of which have the
potential to **[[derail its rise.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[Preoccupied
by mounting challenges]{.mark}, Chinese leaders have to fight an uphill
battle to mobilize resources and internal support for the global
leadership role]{.underline}**. China is far from achieving the donor
sta- tus of many OECD countries. For one prominent Chinese scholar,
**[the most dangerous challenge is the extreme-leftist policy-line and
'the false-large-empty']{.underline}** ( 假大空 ) slogan**[s, making
international promises and setting strategic objectives beyond the reach
of China's national strength]{.underline}**. 42 China's international
initiatives do not play a critical role in China's rise but are the
consequences of its rise. Although some scholars have claimed that the
US power was declining so that the post-World War II order was suffering
from an acute case of Anno Domini, they may have to recant their
predictions. With the world's largest concentration of capital and
technology, the US remains the most powerful nation. **[China has faster
GDP growth than the US, but its net national wealth, i.e. the resources
available to pursue national interests, is still not in America's
league]{.underline}**. From 2000--2012, Chinese net wealth jumped from
\$4.66 trillion to \$21.7 trillion. American net wealth over the same
period rose from \$42.3 trillion to \$67.5 trillion. From 2012 to 2017,
while Chinese net wealth climbed to \$29 trillion, American net wealth
reached to over \$93 trillion. **[Claiming that China is about to
eclipse the US is untenable in the face of \$64 trillion less in net
wealth]{.underline}**. **[The resource advantage rests overwhelmingly
with the US.]{.underline}** 43 China has pushed RMB
internationalization. But the share of RMB in global payment is below 2%
while US dollar share remains above 40%. RMB accounts for a scant 1% of
global reserves while the US dollar accounts for over 60%. The drive to
internationalize RMB has not gained momentum since its inclusion in the
SDR basket in 2015. 44 Shortly before inclusion, China's Central Bank
announced a 'market-oriented' mechanism for setting the daily benchmark
of the exchange rate, accompanied by 2% devaluation, the first since
1994, leading the onshore RMB to tumble by 4% in the subsequent two
days. The Central bank intervened massively to halt the slide in the
weeks after. Less than two months after RMB's inclusion in the IMF
basket, the central bank imposed new controls over capital outflow. 45
These difficulties have made the cost outweigh the benefits of RMB
internationalization. Remaining the 'indispensable nation' of the world,
the US cannot avoid the responsibility to provide public goods and
security protection for its allies. Although President Trump has
distanced Washington from its traditional allies and stepped back from
global leadership, The American economy and geopolitics encourage a
global outlook, imposing compelling imperatives on the superpower. Woven
thickly into global value chains, protectionism calls for other
countries' retaliation against American producers and shifts burdens to
American consumers. With checks and balances in the US constitution and
the dynamism of the open society, economic liberals and
internationalists in the US Government and across the states have been
powerful countervailing forces against protectionism and disengagement.
In spite of President Trump's isolationist position, 'American national
interests endure. They include preventing any hostile power from
dominating Asia, Europe, or the energy resources of the Middle East;
sustaining an open international economic and political order, not
subverted by spheres of influence that exclude the United States;
protecting free access to the global commons, especially the maritime
sea lanes that carry 90 % of global trade; nurturing alliances that
magnify American power and influence; and promoting democracy and human
rights, because the ultimate source of global security is a world in
which power is bounded by law and pluralistic institutions'. 46 Second,
**[[China cannot provide]{.mark} shared values and other elements of
[soft power to]{.mark} common willing- ness on the part of other
countries to align, and in some cases [subordinate]{.mark}, their own
narrow interests to those of [the larger international
community]{.mark}.]{.underline}** China has made significant investments
in developing its soft power with the opening of more than 500 Confucius
Institutes across the world and carrying out extensive international
branding campaigns. But China is not successful in projecting its values
and ideals that others identify with and aspire to share. **[The US
leadership comes with willing followers and trust through a network of
alliances and other tie]{.underline}**s. For all of their differences
with Washington and periodic resentment of its policies, many
**[countries invested more confidence in the US than in any other
nation]{.underline}**. **[China does not possess the attributes that
underpin US leadership. It lacks allies and inspires little trust in its
own neighborhood.]{.underline}** Its efforts to project soft power often
fail to resonate abroad partly because China displays little empathy
with the sensitivities of those living beyond its borders. 47 While
**[US global influence]{.underline}** has dropped due to President
Trump's policy, it **[still holds much more soft power than
China.]{.underline}** Against the background of seemingly retreating
democracy, China's authoritarian- ism appears to be more appealing to
autocracies. But this has not been accompanied by serious and
significant interest worldwide in China's development model.
**[Promoting globalization, the Chinese Government is doing the opposite
by imposing controls on the inflow of information and outflow of
capital, leading people to question the sincerity of its posited global
leadership]{.underline}**. A Chinese scholar admits that **[China might
one day overtake the US in the size of economy but may never overtake
the US influence and leadership in the world.]{.underline}** 48 Another
Chinese scholar finds that China is short of international discursive
power ( 国际话语权缺失 ). China had never played a world leadership role
in history. The traditional Chinese system ( 华夏体系 ) was only an East
Asian system, not universal, and cannot automatically transform into
modern discursive power. 49 Until China develops values that appeal
universally, it misses one of the core features of global leadership.
**[Beijing's overreliance on its economic prowess as the key diplomatic
instrument reveals the shortage of normative power.]{.underline}**
Despite its growing economic and military might, **[China's efforts to
use economic ties to influence other state's behavior have only achieved
limited success because money cannot buy loyalty]{.underline}**.
**[Influence does not simply derive from a country's coffers.
While]{.underline}** closer economic ties are important, they are hardly
sufficient to build strong trust between countries---especially those
with conflicting security interests. **[This is clearly reflected in
China's relationship with Japan, characterized as hot economics and cold
politics.]{.underline}** It is reflected in China's relations with North
Korea, a country that is widely perceived as economically dependent on
China for its own survival but has often taken actions against China's
strategic interests. To play a global leadership role, China has to
build the ability to inspire other countries to share its vision. The
leadership will not work itself out only through economic ties. Building
common identity and value is equally, if not more, important. Unable to
construct shared values, **[China may change nothing of substance in the
global order]{.underline}**. While China's insistence on the Westphalian
principles looks attractive to some countries where intense
interventionism by the US often ends in chaos and chronic instability,
many of China's neighbors view China's great power aspiration with a
wary eye, worrying that, as Chinese power rises, China's imperial past
can produce an undue pressure on its leaders to restore the old Chinese
hierarchical order. One reporter took note that at the 60th anniversary
of the Bandung Conference that gave birth to the Five- Principles, only
two notable leaders turned up. One was President Xi, who used the
occasion to portray China as the leader of the non-western world. The
other was Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who suggested that the threat to
the sovereignty of smaller countries no longer came from the West. 50
China's power aspirations in a diverse and crowded neighborhood are
checked by the presence and influence of the US and other regional
powers. **[The Twenty-first century has seen a multipolarity rather than
a Chinese hegemony. While China is rising, many surrounding states are
also on the rise]{.underline}**. China's shift from espousing a peaceful
rise to assertive behavior has made its neighbors nervous, motivating
them to realign with the US and with each other to balance China. 51
survey found that more than 73 % of correspondents had little or no
confidence that Beijing would do the right thing in contributing to
global peace, security, and governance. 52 A regional Pax Sinica is not
desirable for these countries. Historically, to bandwagon with a rising
power is common practice due to potentially great relative gains. The
most successful rising powers most often attracted the greatest number
of bandwagoners. 53 It does not serve China's interests to have tension
with many neighbors simultaneously**[. China cannot rise successfully
without winning the support of its neighbors or at least preempt their
balancing motives. Third]{.underline}**, **[[China]{.mark} has benefited
and [continues benefiting from the US-led order. US treaty]{.mark}
alliance[s, troops]{.mark} on the ground and naval predominance [have
maintained regional peace and facilitated commerce]{.mark} in Asia and
beyond.]{.underline}** Residing in a neighborhood with complicated power
competition and historical animosities, **[[China has to be measured and
judicious]{.mark}. 'The corollary of the decline of the West is not the
rise of Asia. It is the erosion of Asia]{.underline}**, at least as an
idea, **[as rivalries within geographic Asia overtake the notion of
regional cohesion that once bound these countries
together']{.underline}**. 54 China often expresses concern over the
US--Japan alliance. But the alliance is part of the regional security
architecture that has prevented remilitarization of Japan. 'Imagine what
the regional security picture would look like to China if Japan were
strategically independent from the United States'. 55 Without the US
nuclear umbrella, Japan would have developed nuclear weapons a long time
ago, prompting South Korea and others to develop their nuclear weapons.
One Chinese scholar, therefore, suggested that 'Chinese policymakers and
analysts should not believe their own jingoistic rhetoric about a US in
decline. **[Even if it's true, a weak America isn't good news for
China']{.underline}**. 56

### China Ans: U.S. War---1NC

#### No China war

**[Shifrinson 19]{.underline}**

(assistant professor of international relations at Boston University).
Joshua Shifrinson. 2/8/19. The 'new Cold War' with China is way
overblown. Here's why. February 8, 2019.
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/02/08/there-isnt-a-new-cold-war-with-china-for-these-4-reasons/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.f8ca8195c4e4>

**[Is a new Cold [War]{.mark} looming]{.underline}** --- or already
present --- **[between the United States and China?]{.underline}** Many
analysts argue that a combination of geopolitics, ideology and competing
visions of "global order" are driving the two countries toward emulating
the Soviet-U.S. rivalry that dominated world politics from 1947 through
1990. But such **[[concerns are overblown]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[Here are four big reasons]{.underline}** why**[. 1. The historical
backdrops of the two relationships are very different]{.underline}**
When the Cold War began, the U.S.-Soviet relationship was fragile and
tenuous. Bilateral diplomatic relations were barely a decade old, U.S.
intervention in the Russian Revolution was a recent memory, and the
Soviet Union had called for the overthrow of capitalist governments into
the 1940s. Despite their Grand Alliance against Nazi Germany, the two
countries shared few meaningful diplomatic, economic or institutional
links. **[[In 2019]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the situation between the
United States and China is very different. Since the 1970s,
**[[diplomatic interactions]{.mark}, [institutional ties and
econ]{.mark}omic [flows]{.mark} have all [exploded.]{.mark} Although
each side has criticized the other for domestic
interference]{.underline}** (such as U.S. demands for journalist access
to Tibet and China's espionage against U.S. corporations), **[these
issues did not prevent cooperation on]{.underline}** a host of **[other
issues.]{.underline}** Yes, there were
**[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the past decade, but these
**[[occurred against a]{.mark} generally [cooperative backdrop]{.mark}.
2. Geography and powers' nuclear postures suggest East Asia is more
stable than Cold War-era Europe]{.underline}** The Cold War was shaped
by an intense arms race, nuclear posturing and crises, especially in
continental Europe. Given Europe's political geography, the United
States feared a "bolt from the blue" attack would allow the Soviet Union
to conquer the continent. Accordingly, the United States prepared to
defend Europe with conventional forces, and to deter Soviet
aggrandizement using nuclear weapons. Unsurprisingly, the Soviet Union
also feared that the United States might attack and wanted to deter U.S.
adventurism. Concerns that the other superpower might use force and that
crises could quickly escalate colored Cold War politics. **[Today, [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and China spend]{.mark} proportionally
far [less on]{.mark} their [militaries than the]{.mark} United States
and the [Soviet Union]{.mark} did[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Though an
arms race may be emerging, U.S. and Chinese **[[nuclear postures
are]{.mark} not]{.underline}** nearly **[as large or threatening:
Arsenals]{.underline}** remain far below the size and scope witnessed in
the Cold War, and **[are [kept at]{.mark} a [low]{.mark}er state of
[alert.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As for geography, **[[East Asia is not
primed for tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** akin to those in Cold War
Europe**[[.]{.mark} China can threaten]{.underline}** to coerce **[its
neighbors, but]{.underline}** the **[[water
barriers]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[separating China from]{.underline}**
most of **[Asia's strategically important states [make]{.mark} outright
[conquest]{.mark} significantly [harder.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Of
course, as scholars such as Caitlin Talmadge and Avery Goldstein note,
crises may still erupt, and each side may face pressures to escalate.
**[Unlike the Cold War,]{.underline}** however, **[U.S.-Chinese
[confrontations occur at sea with]{.mark}]{.underline}** relatively
**[[limited forces]{.mark} and [without]{.mark} clear [territorial
boundaries.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This suggests **[there are
[countervailing factors]{.mark} that may [give]{.mark} the two sides
[room to negotiate]{.mark} --- [and limit]{.mark} the speed with which a
[crisis]{.mark} unfolds]{.underline}**. **[3. The Cold War had just two
major powers]{.underline}** The Cold War took place in a bipolar system,
with the United States and Soviet Union uniquely powerful, compared with
other nations. This dynamic often pushed the United States and the
U.S.S.R. toward confrontation and contributed to more or less fixed
alliances; moreover, it encouraged efforts to suppress prospective great
powers, such as Germany. In 2019, it's not at all clear we are back to
bipolarity. Analysts remain divided over whether the U.S. unipolar era
is waning (or is already over) --- and, if so, whether we are heading
for a new period of bipolarity, modern-day multipolarity or something
else. Regardless, most analysts accept that **[other countries will play
a central role in East Asian security affairs.]{.underline}** Russia,
for example, still benefits from legacy military investments, India is
developing economically and militarily, and Japan is beginning to build
highly capable military forces to complement its still-significant
economic might. Even if these nations aren't as powerful as the United
States or China, their presence makes for more fluid diplomatic
arrangements and more diffuse security concerns than during the
U.S.-Soviet competition. The resulting security dynamics are therefore
likely to look very different. **[4. Ideology plays less of a role in
U.S.-Chinese relations Many people see the Cold War as an ideological
contest between U.S.-backed liberalism and Soviet-backed
communism.]{.underline}** But that's not the whole story. The early 20th
century saw liberalism, communism and fascism vie for ideological
preeminence. With fascism defeated alongside Nazi Germany, the postwar
stage was set for a struggle between communism and liberalism to
reinforce the U.S.-Soviet contest. That each ideology claimed universal
scope ensured that the ideologies served as rallying cries for Third
World conflicts, which were subsequently associated with the U.S.-Soviet
struggle. **[The respective ["ideologies"]{.mark} of the United States
and China [do not favor]{.mark} this type of [contest]{.mark}
today[.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Indeed, **[analysts calling for a
hard-line stance]{.underline}** against China have **[faced
difficulties]{.underline}** even **[identifying a coherent Chinese
ideological alternative.]{.underline}** And while some researchers
**[claim that a nascent ideological contest pitting an "autocratic"
China against the "liberal" United States]{.underline}** is emerging,
this narrative **[ignores the political contests that shape Chinese
politics]{.underline}** (and have parallels in U.S. politics)**[.
Autocracies and democracies often cooperate]{.underline}**. And **[on
one important ideological issue]{.underline}** --- **[how they organize
their economic lives]{.underline}** --- **[[China and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates have [both embraced]{.mark} economic [growth via
trade]{.mark}, the private sector and semi-free markets]{.underline}**.

**[[Cyber deterrence is inherently]{.mark} more
[challenging]{.mark}]{.underline}** than nuclear or conventional
deterrence **[[because]{.mark} such at[tacks are difficult to]{.mark}
definitively [attribut]{.mark}e]{.underline}** to a particular actor.
For example, it is easier to mask the source of a cyberattack on a power
grid than it would have been for the Warsaw Pact to conceal a massive
incursion into West Germany. **[[This attribution problem could
complicate NATO's capacity to conclusively determine the source of a
cyberattac]{.mark}k]{.underline}** and justify and conduct a timely
conventional response, **[[particularly if member states diverge in
their perceptions]{.mark}. This dilemma could strain the foundations of
collective defense and undermine any unified front against
cyberattacks]{.underline}**.

For NATO to commit to military action, all of its members would need
certainty, beyond a reasonable doubt, about the identity of the
perpetrator. This is particularly true in the case of Russia---a known
sponsor of cyberattacks. Without conclusive proof, it might be a
challenge to convince a distant country like Portugal or a dangerously
close one like Estonia to join in a counterattack. Complicating matters,
such post-attack decisions would need to be made quickly, given Russia's
precedent of using cyberwarfare as a precursor to kinetic invasion. The
need for speed leaves little room for philosophical debates over what
constitutes an act of war.

**[[Cyberspace enables anonymous attacks]{.mark}. [Identities are easily

astute opponent will of course make it look as if another was

attribution]{.underline}** - the source of an attack, at the first
iteration, will be innocent and unknowing third parties. Forensic work
may eventually reveal the source of an attack, but **[[a sophisticated
opponent will be able to operate clandestinely and with a high degree of
deniability.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The "Confickr" worm is a good
example of this difficulty. Confickr was a global malware that infected
millions of computers.1 Many companies and governments made a
coordinated effort to fend it off, but we still have no idea who
launched Confickr, what their intent was, or even whether it has been
removed from all infected systems.

**[[Weak attribution and unpredictable collateral damage make deterrence
ineffective in cyberspace. Deterrence is a threat of retaliation, but it
is hard to credibly threaten unknown parties and counterproductive to
threaten or damage the wrong party]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United
States is widely recognized to have pre-eminent offensive cyber
capabilities, but it obtains little deterrent effect from this.

**[In the absence of attribution]{.underline}**, the **[[response
options]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the United States to the July 4
events **[[were extremely limited]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We could not
retaliate against an unknown attacker. Deterrence is the threat of
violent retaliation. This threat changes the opponent's calculus of the
benefits and costs of an attack. But it is hard to convincingly threaten
an unknown attacker, and weak attribution makes traditional deterrent
concepts -- those based on the threat of reprisal for an attack (either
counterforce or countervalue) -- largely irrelevant in cyberspace.

### Solvency: Cohesion Problems---1NC

#### Political problems threaten cohesion, undermine the plan's effectivenss

**[Psychogiou, Finabel researcher, '22]{.underline}**

\[Vasiliki Psychogiou, Finabel research intern, "Cyberspace: Is NATO

Undoubtedly, **[cyberspace has become a key playing field of
NATO's]{.underline}** overall **[defence and deterrence
posture]{.underline}**. Yet, **[the question remains whether the
Alliance is doing enough]{.underline}**. NATO's internal challenges can
significantly underestimate its efforts to build a solid cybersecurity
posture. **[[NATO has traditionally focused more on its military
character rather than on its political role]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
promote constructive internal dialogue among its members, to consult on
defence and security-related issues to solve problems, build trust and,
in the long run, prevent conflict. Thus, **[it is essential that NATO
updates its political foundation and enhances its political cohesion
under its common purpose, that is, the protection of the Euro-Atlantic
area]{.underline}** (NATO, 2021; NATO, 2020; Deschaux-Dutard, 2021;
Brent, 2019).

Moreover, the Alliance has often been accused of being a monolithic
structure rather than a hub of political dialogue (Shea, 2020). Disputes
between its Allies have often impacted NATO unity on external matters.
Driven mainly by national interests, these **[[disputes have constrained
NATO's cohesion. Worries have also been expressed about the commitment
of the United States to the defence of the European
continent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the impact of the European Union's
development as a security actor on the future of NATO, the commitment of
some European Allies to burden-sharing of defence, and the development
of political inroads by NATO's rivals into the Alliance territory
(Reflection Group, 2020; Belkin, 2020; NATO, 2021; NATO, 2020;
Deschaux-Dutard, 2021; Brent, 2019; Shea, 2020). All **[[these issues
have significantly challenged NATO's decision-making, which needs

cyberspace-related matters]{.underline}**.

**[[Another major challenge emanates from undermining NATO's fundamental
principles from inside. Some allied governments have moved away from
NATO's fundamental freedoms]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Ricketts, 2020).
**[For instance, [Poland, Hungary, and Turkey have undermined free

actions have threatened]{.mark} democracy, individual liberty and the
rule of law, [the foundation of the]{.mark} North Atlantic
[Treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Lute & Burns, 2019). Erdogan has aligned
Turkey closer to Moscow rather than the United States or the European
Union (Petrov, Schütte et al., 2020). As a result, NATO's cohesion and
credibility are at stake with important implications for its deterrence,
defence and security posture in all domains, including cyberspace (NATO,
2021; NATO, 2020; Deschaux-Dutard, 2021; Brent, 2019; Shea, 2020).

The cyber operations discussed earlier in this paper have the capacity
to undermine fundamental ideas of democratic citizenship in a way that
traditional military attacks do not. One of the key lessons learned from
the strategic bombing campaigns in World War I, World War II, the
Vietnam War, and other war theaters is that physical attacks against a
population are more likely to result in a hardening of morale and
increased patriotism rather than demoralization and surrender.
**[[Hybrid threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly cyber threats,
**[[pose a conundrum for democratic governments]{.underline}]{.mark}**
**[[trying to ensure that their societies are
resilient]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The ability]{.underline}]{.mark}**
of any democratic country **[[to counter hybrid
threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in large part, **[[depends on the
willingness of]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[citizens to support
government policies aimed at combating hybrid
actors]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In turn, **[[some of the things that
democratic governments would like to do]{.underline}]{.mark}** to combat
hybrid threats **[[may undermine]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of the
**[[basic freedoms]{.underline}]{.mark}** that define what it means to
be a democratic country. These basic freedoms include personal freedoms
such as the right to privacy at home and the right to have private
conversations and private correspondence that is not subject to
government monitoring. On the one hand, government monitoring of
personal conversations and personal activities is an action that is
associated with the worst aspects of autocratic rule. On the other hand,
**[[if]{.mark}]{.underline}** hybrid **[[actors use cyber systems to
cause damage then the only way to combat the threat seems to be through
monitoring]{.underline}]{.mark}** and using the same systems.

What is unique in the current era, and particularly in the case of
hybrid threats, is that **[[citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
democratic countries have in some cases advocated, or **[[been complicit
in]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he **[[undermining of their own democratic
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** and freedoms. Government officials have
argued that only by limiting some rights and freedoms can hybrid threats
be effectively countered. Many citizens are willing to acquiesce. U.S.
citizens' contradictory views on the U.S. National Security Agency's
(NSA) widespread collection programs that were revealed by Edward
Snowden illustrate the conundrum. It is widely known that the NSA
collection programs monitored and stored (and continue to do so) the
data from billions of phone calls each day as well as email messages,
instant messages, Facebook posts, contact lists, videos, chat, file
transfers, on-line social networking information, and other internet
data.

1, 2018, p. 72-73\]

U.S. citizens are not alone in acquiescing to increasingly intrusive
government surveillance and monitoring. The
**[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark}** of France, Germany, United
Kingdom, Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway,38 and
Switzerland 39 **[[have all recently deliberated or passed laws allowing
greater surveillance of their own populations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A
recent analysis by journalist Hugh Eakin concluded, "**[[the very
qualities that have made Sweden and Norway successful models of advanced
democracy may also have made their populations more susceptible to
government spying]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In Norway, the government
committee that put forward the mass surveillance legislation now before
parliament has argued that such measures 'can be justified as necessary
in a democratic society'." 40 This is an argument that seems to resonate
and be accepted by citizens across Western democracies. **[[This gradual
relinquishing of democratic freedoms is a result of hybrid warfare
strategies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is a phenomenon that requires much
more attention from scholars and democratic citizens alike.

Conclusion

Hybrid warfare presents a conundrum for Western democracies and their
citizens. Increasingly, **[[these governments have argued that their
ability to counter cyber threats]{.underline}]{.mark}** and "irregular"
agents such as terrorists **[[depends on the government's ability to
monitor all forms of communication,]{.underline}]{.mark}** information
and social connections on the internet and through cellular networks.
This paper has suggested that the **[[willingness of citizens to support
government surveillance programs will ultimately undermine the basic
freedoms]{.underline}]{.mark}** that define what it means to be a
democratic country. Hybrid warfare has opened a new era for
international politics and Western democracies as democratic governance
is undermined not only by hybrid warfare threats, but also by actions
taken by democratic governments to counter those threats.

The Political Challenges of Resilience

**[[A further set of challenges for NATO members regarding resilience
policies revolve around efficiency and costs. The drive towards greater
efficiency that underlies modern economies and societies can inhibit
resilience.]{.underline}]{.mark}** As Andrew Zolli and Ann Marie Healy
note, "**[a seemingly perfect system is often the most fragile, while a
dynamic system, subject to occasional failure, can be the most
robust]{.underline}**".24

**[[This is a consequence of individual actions having wider effects in
more interdependent systems. Advances in information and communication
technologies and the growth of crossborder economic
interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example, **[[have increased
vulnerabilities to disruption]{.mark}.25]{.underline}** As Secretary
General Stoltenberg put it, **[NATO members might be "more
prosperous]{.underline}**" **[in "today's interconnected and digital
world ... but they are also ... more vulnerable]{.underline}**".26 Hence
there is the need, as underlined in the Strengthened Resilience
Commitment, to work with the whole of government and non-governmental
sectors to increase NATO resilience.27

However, **[[creating resilience is almost inherently expensive. Unlike
efficient systems that engage with existing environments, proactive
resilience measures plan for worst-case scenarios that may not even
emerge. This creates a dilemma for politicians who wish to be seen
neither to over- nor underreact to potential
shocks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Take the example of disease prevention in
the United States. The 1976 "swine flu affair" was marked by a
significant degree of government action, including \$137 million spent
on vaccine research and the costs of inoculating 40 million Americans
before the "sorry debacle" was abandoned as unnecessary, as The New York
Times put it.28 On the other hand, the Trump administration called for a
17 percent cut in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) just two years before the COVID-19 pandemic.29 The
Trump case is indicative of policies in the era of austerity that
followed the 2008-2009 financial crisis, as NATO members have generally
hedged their bets against hypothetical shocks by reducing funding.

**[challenge emerges for NATO and governments of alliance members: how

the contemporary security environment means that "it is not enough to
have strong militaries alone" as NATO also "need\[s\] strong
societies".31 This is necessary for defence and deterrence: cohesive
societies will not only generate resilience in the face of adversity but
may also discourage the belief by adversaries that hostile behaviour
will prevail. But **[[the required public mindset cannot be built
without trust in the message that the authorities are trying to get
across. If the messaging is regarded as opportunistic or politically
motivated, the effort will fail. This is particularly true in an era of

### Solvency: Private Sector Blocks---1NC

#### Private sector is key and they say no

First, there are a number of flaws in the militarisation of the cyber
domain. The majority of those with the necessary technical skills to
respond to the cyber security challenges work outside of the military
sector. In addition, **[[a large proportion of the
infrastructure]{.mark} within the cyber domain is [privately owned and
operated. This prevents NATO from making a substantial contribution to
its protection]{.mark}. Crucially, [NATO does not have any rights, or
powers, to intervene]{.mark} in the private sector. [Given NATO's
current lack of expertise in the area, private sector firms are unlikely
to welcome NATO assistance.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Solvency: Private Sector Blocks---2NC

#### Private actors are superior---the plan confounds those efforts

For example, **[attacks against]{.underline}** domestic **[critical
infrastructure constitute an]{.underline}** unrefined and hugely
**[expansive mission space]{.underline}**. Should it be an alliance
military mission? Should this come under NATO's security umbrella?
Expanding Article V protections to attacks against private sector
operations may seem logical to some, but NATO should proceed with great
caution before promising its security umbrella to cyber homeland
security and resiliency. Asserting protection and response to attacks in
this area, over-states NATO's capacities and undermines alliance
credibility.

There are a host of reasons why NATO must confine its ambitions to
government network defense and response, and rethink whether domestic
infrastructure protection really is -- or should be -- part of its writ.

First among the reasons is that the **[[private
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}** owns and operates the vast majority of
critical infrastructure and [**[may not want NATO]{.underline}**
**[or]{.underline}**]{.mark} even their own
[**[government's]{.underline}** **[help]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[The
[private sector has its own diverse perspectives]{.mark}, and the crisis
management links between government and the private sector simply do not
exist. [Calling this a NATO mission makes essential coordination with
the private sector exponentially harder.]{.mark} [Differing national
laws and ethos that define government--private sector cooperation makes
it nearly impossibl]{.mark}e.]{.underline}**

NATO members, like so many national governments, continue to minimize
the reality that the private sector is at least as central as
governments in cyber crisis management and response. Unlike traditional
armed conflict, deterrence and crisis management is a joint venture with
the private sector, no matter how often governments think they will be
the tip of the spear.

**[The private sector is not only a co-equal branch in cyber crisis
management but has different stakes than governments and multinational
alliances. [Information technology and other major companies are
borderless, and responsive to global stakeholders]{.mark} and financial
markets. Their interests often do not align with those of governments,
and certainly not major military alliances]{.underline}**. The
**[[private sector generally has superior
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** than governments. Its **[decisions
about what to do, when to do it, and how to do it, will take government
views into account but will not be beholden to them.]{.underline}**

Revisiting North Korea's repeated attacks against Sony America's
networks throughout 2014 highlight how different and difficult crisis
management is in the domestic digital domain. NATO will do well to
remember how complicated this event was for the United States national
security apparatus.

In brief, the North Korean state attacked the digital data stores of the
American subsidiary of a Japanese company. The key actors through most
of the crisis were all in the private sector, and Sony responses were
framed more by the actions of its rivals and business partners in
industry than anything said or done by government. Not surprisingly,
individual business interests outweighed common cause. Private sector
unity was not possible.

Of course the U.S. government played an important role late in the
crisis when President Obama declared there to be a national interest in
the situation and imposed sanctions on the North Korean state. But the
central point is that critical decisions were made by the private
sector, based on business needs, damage assessments, and capabilities.

Government was not able to manage this major crisis even though it
involved a nuclear weapon state threatening physical strikes in the U.S.
homeland. Events since, such as Apple's refusal to cooperate with a
court order to assist the government in accessing encrypted information
on a terrorist's iPhone, reinforces the reality that the relationship
between government and industry is getting more distant, not closer.
Apple probably would be even less likely to cooperate with a 28 nation
military alliance than with its "home" government.

Just imagine how complex it would be for a 28 nation military alliance
to assert response dominion against digital attacks by a known adversary
against the networks controlling a member's key infrastructure. What if
the company(s) involved had deep business interests in the adversary
nation and refused to work with the alliance in fashioning a response?
What if its business interest compelled accommodation? What if it did
not want to share its essential capabilities with government (or a large
military alliance) fearing doing so would be a competitive disadvantage?

National security officials across the globe struggle with the idea that
the private sector is not subservient to government in protecting their
information technology interests and often is just as capable as
government in intelligence gathering and response planning. Cohesion
between the two worlds is not likely unless the private sector becomes
an essential actor in this element of national security decision making
space.

This is not to say industry can operate alone. Industry has many
dependencies on government. Only governments can set laws and press
treaty enforcement between states. Industry relies on government to
provide emergency response assistance if digital strikes have a physical
effect, such as a major power outage. Governments often hold key bits of
information that can complete the operating picture environment.

**[The shared dependency between government and the public sector
provide opportunity to remake decision-making processes heretofore made
solely by government actors]{.underline}**. Until we make more headway
remaking these processes, **[[NATO would be wise to constrain its
ambitions to defending its own networks and improving its operational
resiliency]{.mark}. It should set aside planning to protect and respond
to digital strikes against privately owned domestic critical
infrastructure.]{.underline}**

**[NATO has more than enough challenges ensuring its communications
integrity and updating war]{.underline}** plans to fully accommodate for
fighting in the digital domain. [**[Let's leave the hornet's nest of
what the alliance should do in response to attacks on domestic
infrastructure and private companies to a more settled
period]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
