#### The European Union should increase its security cooperation by: encouraging Member States to incorporate resilience as a core concept; establishing common European cyber security standards for products across markets; supporting cyber coordination through Security Operation Centres, increasing coordination of the Joint Cyber Unit; supporting expansion of industry partnerships to appropriate non-members; supporting foresight analysis; supporting the development of a cyber code of conduct.

#### EU solves -- cyber doctrine creates the conditions for collective cyber defense.

Market of the European Union, 9-16-2021, How a European Cyber Resilience
Act will help protect Europe, published on LinkedIn,

**[\"If everything is connected, everything can be hacked. [Given that
resources are scarce,]{.mark} we have to bundle our forces. \[\...\]
This is why [we need a European Cyber Defence Policy, including
legislation setting common standards]{.mark} [under a new European Cyber
Resilience Act]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.\"]{.mark}

With these strong words in her 2021 State of the Union address, European
Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed the geo-strategic
dimension of cybersecurity and cyberdefence. And why it is essential for
Europe to invest substantially and urgently in the face of cyber threats
of all kinds: security, defence, hybrid.

The world is vulnerable to large-scale cyber attacks

**[Recent events remind us of the extent to which [Europe]{.mark}, and
more generally the world, [remains vulnerable to large-scale cyber
attacks]{.mark}. These include attacks on the Irish health care system
in the midst of a health crisis. The ransomware identified by Kaseya.
The hacking of the Colonial Pipeline]{.underline}**. Or the cyber
attacks against the municipality of Anhalt-Bitterfeld in Germany or
those targeting Thessaloniki in Greece. According to the European Union
Agency for Cyber Security, ENISA, **[[attacks on our supply
chains]{.mark} will increase fourfold in 2021 compared to last year.
[And]{.mark} attacks on [cloud infrastructure have increased]{.mark}
fivefold in one year. Transport, government and industry sectors are the
most affected.]{.underline}** With the explosion of connected objects
and the increased use of industrial data, the risk surface is merging
with our entire continent. [Moreover, cyber technologies are by
definition dual. [The line between cyber security and cyber defence
is]{.mark} becoming increasingly [blurred]{.mark}. Whether the attack is
motivated by greed or by a desire to destabilise a country, an economy,
or democratic processes such as elections, the penetration techniques
are often the same. Faced with these new kinds of threats, [we cannot
remain with our usual silo reflexe]{.mark}s. We must have a common
European approach that integrates all the dimensions of cyber, whether
civilian or military.]{.underline} **[To protect ourselves better, our
only option is to act together, at European level.]{.underline}** In an
interconnected single market, we are only as strong as the weakest link.
[We must therefore improve our level of security collectively. Today,
given the diversity and sophistication of attacks, no country can face a
cyber threat alone, as it knows no borders]{.underline}. To do this, we
need advanced technology, secure infrastructure, common requirements,
increased operational cooperation and effective sanctions. This is what
President Ursula von der Leyen has announced.

**[[Europe must become a leader in cybersecurity, through a genuine
European Cyber Defence Policy]{.mark}, in order [to protect, detect,
defend and deter]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This new policy will of
course build on what has already been put on the table, both in terms of
regulation and technology. It will be a matter of taking our ambition a
step further.]{.underline}**

Increasing our collective resilience

**[Firstly, [protect, to increase our collective
resilience.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[To do this, we [must ensure our technological sovereignty]{.mark} in
the cyber field]{.underline}**. Our real strategic autonomy and ability
to act will depend on our ability to master and develop cutting-edge
technologies in Europe.

We estimate that [[the EU, its Member States and the private sector
could invest up to €4.5 billion]{.mark} over the period 2021-2027 [in
the development and deployment of cyber security technologies.]{.mark}
This amount should be complemented by investments from Ministries of
Defence as well as from the European Defence Fund.]{.underline}

I am counting heavily on our new European Cybersecurity Competence
Centre based in Romania to [organise European technological research
more effectively and to strengthen our technological
sovereignty.]{.underline} However, in order to mobilise all efforts in a
coherent manner and **[[to avoid duplication,]{.mark} I believe that [we
must work together]{.mark}]{.underline}**, within the framework of the
Cyber Defence Policy announced by the President, [to draw up a specific
European cyber capability plan integrating all civilian and military
needs. [This would make it possible]{.mark}, for example, [to combine
all efforts]{.mark} in the field of research and quantum technology,
which will ultimately change the security of the digital space as we
know it today]{.underline}. We will build on the Observatory of critical
technologies that we have set up.

In addition to technology, [we must also act on the regulatory front to
raise the level of security within our single market. We have therefore
proposed a revision of the Network Security Directives (NIS) to provide
a framework for the obligations of the main economic
players.]{.underline}

**[In order to increase our resilience,]{.underline}** **[[we need to
establish common European cyber security standards for products]{.mark}
(especially connected objects) and services that are placed on our
market]{.underline}**. This will be the purpose of the European Cyber
Resilience Act announced by the President. I believe that [this Act
should also have a defence dimension in order to maximise synergies,
enabling, for example, defence requirements to be taken into
account.]{.underline}

From 190 days to several hours to detect a sophisticated attack

**[Then, detect.]{.underline}**

**[Today, [it takes]{.mark} an average of [190 days to detect a
sophisticated attack]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [We must drastically
reduce this time]{.underline} ]{.mark}[to a few hours. This is an
imperative condition for greater resilience]{.underline}. Because early
detection means that the necessary countermeasures can be put in place
quickly.

[[This will involve setting up a European network of Security Operation
Centres]{.mark} (SOCs) which will -- in conjunction with national and
private SOCs -- scan the network using artificial intelligence
technologies [and detect weak signals of
attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} A true \"cyber border guard\" of
our European information space, this network of SOCs must be able to
integrate information from national or, in the long term, European
military SOCs (financed, for example, by the European Defence Fund).

**[Joint Cyber Unit]{.underline}**

**[Defend, too.]{.underline}**

**[[Europe must be better equipped to deal with a major attack. This is
the ambition and the objective of the Joint Cyber Unit]{.mark} that we
presented last June in order to [lay the first foundations for an
operational crisis management capability and European
solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[We have clearly identified the shortcomings of the current system:
too many cybersecurity players, who work in silos, in a fragmented
way.]{.underline}**

**[So we need more operational and technical
coordination.]{.underline}**

Such a unit could thus work closely with the Joint Situation Awareness
Centre mentioned by the President.

**[[Develop a real doctrine on cyber attacks]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Finally, dissuade.]{.underline}**

**[To become a global player in the cyber field, [Europe needs to
develop a real doctrine on cyber attacks]{.mark} as well as operational
and offensive cyber defence capabilities.]{.underline}**

**[We must be able to [move forward on]{.mark} our [attribution]{.mark}
capabilities and develop a real cyber diplomacy as we have just done
with the first sanctions against those having carried out cyber attacks
in Europe]{.underline}**.

**[The aim must be to gradually develop a genuine operational cyber
pillar as an integral part of our ambition for a common European
defence]{.underline}**. Yes, it is a complicated and delicate subject
because it touches the heart of our Member States' national sovereignty,
but now is the time to address it. I believe that this will be one of
the important elements of the Strategic Compass carried by the High
Representative Josep Borrell.

\*\*\*

**[Faced with cyber threats, [the European Union cannot compromise and
must do everything possible to increase our resilience]{.mark}, together
[with its Member States.]{.mark} To preserve our industry, our public
services, our infrastructures, our security and defence.]{.underline}**

That is also what European technological sovereignty is all about.

#### Overextending NATO presents financial and security risks -- offloading is necessary to preserve collective defense.

**[[NATO's continued transformation]{.mark} in the coming years [seems
all but certain]{.mark};]{.underline}** **[less certain is what it will
transform into]{.underline}**. **[[The alliance has survived]{.mark}
this long [by adapting.]{.mark} But [unlike during previous rounds of
adaptation]{.mark} that involved the alliance taking on more
responsibilities and tasks, the coming decades]{.underline}**---[whose
defining feature will be [the]{.mark} continued [rise of
China]{.mark}]{.underline}---**[[will require a much more narrowly
focused alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For nigh on three decades,
[NATO had the luxury of pondering what kind of alliance it wanted to be
as it searched for a new raison d'etre in the reduced threat environment
following the end of the Cold War. But the contrast between the 1990s
and today's deluge of challenges and threats is stark, and [NATO **no
longer has the luxury of time.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To ensure the alliance's future operational utility, [the alliance must
embrace its]{.mark} original [collective defense identity and **look for
ways to streamline, and**]{.mark} where possible [**reduce**, its
**existing collective security and crisis management
activities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition to offloading existing
responsibilities to the EU and UN, [[NATO should]{.mark} think twice
before taking on new mandates and **[avoid elevating new tasks like
resiliency]{.mark}** or counterterrorism missions and [assigning]{.mark}
them [equal importance to Article 5.]{.mark} [The alternative]{.mark} to
the vision outlined here [is]{.mark} [an alliance increasingly weighed
down]{.mark} by a myriad of tasks]{.underline}, unable to prioritize
among them, and [[lacking both the political will and financial
resources]{.underline} **[to perform its main
function]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [An overburdened NATO risks being
unable to fulfill its chief purpose of collective defense, [thereby
increasing the risk of further fracturing]{.mark} within [the
alliance]{.mark}. The proposed course of action will by no means be an
easy one. But it provides the best chance to guarantee that the
transatlantic alliance will have the capabilities and assets needed to
meet the challenges posed by China's rise.]{.underline}

#### Increased presence in digital diplomacy and global security initiatives aligns the EU with the U.S. as a catalyst for global leadership

**[The Russian invasion of Ukraine offers some important lessons for EU
digital diplomacy.]{.underline}** Before the the war, the union was
already supporting Ukraine in digital regulatory alignment as part of
the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement. However, **[[the EU had not
engaged in a sufficiently]{.mark} long-term and [deep effort to]{.mark}
restructure and align Ukraine's digital environment. [Support]{.mark}ing
third [countries,]{.mark} especially those [in the EU's immediate
neighbourhood]{.mark}, in sound digital [regulation is
crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}** not only for the economic development of
those countries but also for their political stability and security.
**[[Stronger regulatory alignment,]{.mark} as Ukraine shows,
[can]{.mark} already substantially [pull countries towards the
EU]{.mark} economically and politically -- [and contribute to]{.mark} EU
[foreign policy objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In strategically
important countries, [the EU should double-down on efforts to foster
such processes.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Similarly, as set out in the Strategic Compass**[, [the EU should now
increase its efforts to fight disinformation and expand]{.mark} them to
other regions where Russian and Chinese disinformation is spreading
rapidly]{.underline}**. The EU will not be able to fend off
disinformation everywhere, but by devising a comprehensive strategy and
setting priorities the EU can move from a reactive to a pro-active
stance and create a structured approach to fighting disinformation
globally.

**[Lastly, the EU's decision to deploy its cyber rapid response team in
Ukraine certainly came too late and was outperformed by that of the
US.]{.underline}** **[If the EU wants to be a geopolitical actor[, it
must increase its capacity to swiftly assist third countries in
cyber-defence]{.mark} and have a greater awareness of when and where to
deploy that capacity.]{.underline}**

Ukraine shows that not only [does [the EU]{.mark} need to have the right
instruments for digital diplomacy, but it [must also have the awareness,
strategy, resources, and structures]{.mark} to deploy]{.underline} them.
The previous section laid out a large toolbox of potential digital
diplomacy instruments. To effectively use these tools, [the EU must
establish new structures and devote more resources to enabling EU
delegations to inform Brussels, engaging in cooperation with third
countries, and deploying support systems in third
countries]{.underline}.

[Therefore, a comprehensive mapping of both EU internal digital policy
as well global developments at the intersection of technology and
geopolitics is needed, not only for the strategy's development but also
to inform the deployment of many of the proposed
instruments]{.underline}. The EU needs to gain a better understanding of
when to best initiate policy dialogues, and with which third countries
to do so. The union needs to better understand where and how to
strategically invest in digital development in other regions. The [EU
also needs greater awareness of when swift action and cooperation with
allies is necessary in international standards forums. And it should
know when and where to deploy countering disinformation efforts,
election interference, and cyber rapid response teams.]{.underline}

Our interviews with the heads of EEAS delegations show that the global
network of EEAS and member states' delegations should be better
leveraged. These delegations already engage in digital diplomacy, but
they often do so reactively and inadequately because of a lack of
expertise, insufficient resources, and too little support and
information from Brussels and other capitals.

[As a first step, the EEAS and member states' delegations should receive
digital diplomacy training. The EU and the member states should educate
their diplomats in the geopolitical importance of digital technologies
and provide them with a comprehensive overview and analysis of the tools
at their disposal for EU digital diplomacy]{.underline}. They should
have the ability to screen important digital policy developments in
their countries or international organisations -- and, importantly, they
should have reporting structures to engage with Brussels and member
state capitals on important digital policy developments.

However, training delegations will not be enough to meet EU digital
diplomacy objectives around the world. Even when trained on digital
policy, delegations will not be capable of fully engaging in the often
highly technical discussions of digital technologies. Rather,
delegations should serve as the union's eyes, ears, and initiators for
further EU digital policy engagement.

Support structures should thus be created through which delegations can
request additional digital policy expertise. [[The EU can
establish]{.mark} this additional [digital diplomacy expertise]{.mark}
both [on the regional level as well as in Brussels]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The EEAS already has a system in some larger countries or in regional
hubs in which delegation teams have additional policy experts dedicated
to specific policy fields -- including trade, health, and environment --
at their disposal. However, only in very few countries is such expertise
on digital policy available. [The union should therefore assign
additional digital policy experts to regional hubs to support country
delegations in the more in-depth aspects of digital
diplomacy.]{.underline}

Similarly, the EU already has a unit at DG CONNECT dedicated to policy
outreach and international affairs. But this unit's work is currently
mostly limited to the EU's large technology diplomacy initiatives,
including the TTCs, the Global Gateway, and the digital partnerships.
This unit should be provided with significant additional resources to
expand its work. Furthermore, it should provide on-demand support to
European delegations around the world seeking to move ahead with, for
example, digital policy dialogues, standardisation cooperation, or
connectivity investments.

[Moreover, the EU should establish cooperation structures between the
EEAS and member states' delegations in third countries and, most
importantly, in international organisations. [It is crucial that the EU
acts decisively and with one voice in international negotiations]{.mark}
on digital technologies.]{.underline} The EEAS and the member states
should ensure continuous information sharing to, for example, coordinate
their negotiating strategies in multilateral technology forums. [Such
cooperation can of course be expanded to the EU's international allies
and should often incorporate private sector actors.]{.underline}

To effectively deploy all the instruments proposed in the previous
section, [more structural changes and additional units and resources are
needed across various EU bodies. This includes lines of communication
between delegations and the EU's cybersecurity bodies and more
coordination between the union's international affairs, trade, and
development units.]{.underline} It should be within the responsibility
of the task force established for the development of the strategy, and
led by the HRVP and the European Commission, to expand on these
proposals and oversee the realisation of the strategy and the deployment
of its tools.

[With a hybrid war raging in Europe and in cyberspace]{.underline},
[geo-technology battles between the great powers are intensifying. And
with new technologies on the rise, [the EU must seize this moment of
increased political alignment with the US]{.mark} and other countries to
set forth an ambitious agenda for digital diplomacy]{.underline}. [With
this digital diplomacy effort, the EU should promote a democratic, human
rights-focused, and rules-based global technological order]{.underline}.
It should work more closely with its partners to improve global security
in the physical and digital spheres. [And it should promote open,
balanced, and inclusive digital markets and facilitate secure
connectivity -- especially in the global south. To reach these goals, it
is essential for the commission and the EEAS to work together, and for
EU member states to align their external and digital policies more
closely to enhance the efficacy of this policy.]{.underline}

The authors of this policy brief believe that the vision, strategy, and
tools laid out in this paper can give direction and contribute to this
process. [They [can]{.mark} also [lay the foundations for the EU to
become a global player in the geopolitics of
technology]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### US-EU leadership is [zero-sum]{.underline} and EU [regulatory cred]{.underline} prevents [global war]{.underline} 

- Trade wars, great power conflict, multilateral institution breakdown

**[Dworkin, 18]{.underline}** (Anthony Dworkin, visiting lecturer in the
Paris School of International Affairs, and Mark Leonard, co-founder and

**[The world is becoming a scarier place. [Trade wars loom, great-power
competition is returning, proxy conflict is
spreading]{.mark},]{.underline}** and President Donald Trump has
withdrawn the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris
agreement on climate change. **[Rules and alliances that once promoted
international cooperation and stability seem to be losing their hold. In
their place, there is a resurgence of international relations based on
assertive nationalism, winner-takes-all competition, and disdain for the
rule of law]{.underline}**. Hopes that international politics would
encourage the spread of democracy and human rights have faltered, while
**[authoritarianism and illiberalism are]{.underline}** in the
**[ascendant]{.underline}**. These changes have led many people to argue
that the liberal international order developed after the second world
war is breaking down.

The rules-based order is under threat both from inside and outside. For
most of the period since 1945, it was a joint project of the US and its
European allies. But now Europe must respond to a radical shift in which
the US -- under Trump -- has become a significant threat to the system.
Trump's policies and disregard for European views and interests have
created a crisis that compounds longer-term strains on the international
order. In response, the European Union urgently needs to design and
implement a strategy for preserving the core elements of a rules-based
order. This policy brief attempts to work out a vision of international
order that could guide the EU, and to suggest how the EU could put this
vision into practice.

**[The EU is heavily invested in the]{.underline}** idea of a
**[rules-based international order. The Union exemplifies the belief
that states are most able to prosper through cooperation]{.underline}**,
openness, and a rule of law that incorporates a commitment to democracy
and human rights. **[The EU's international standing is linked to the
credibility of the principles it embodies.]{.underline}** More
practically, European countries want an international order that
protects them from external threats and allows them to promote their
economic interests through worldwide trade and investment. European
public policy is committed to the principle that multilateralism is the
best way to create global public goods. Given these positions, the EU
has good reason to be concerned about the condition of the liberal
order, and to develop policies that aim to restore or preserve the
order's most important elements.

Yet this goal cannot be achieved merely by trying to roll back attacks
on the order to recreate the international system as it existed in the
past. The liberal order was never settled or perfect. It was an
evolving, multilayered framework of norms, institutions, and practices
that had internal tensions and weak points. Although it offered many
benefits to its participants, the order was less consistent and
inclusive than its proponents liked to think, and it was based on a
distribution of global power that no longer exists. The task for the EU
is not to look back but to shape a renewed vision of international order
that is suited to today's world, and to European interests and influence
as they are now.

The liberal order's evolution and challenges

The effort to develop a European vision for an adapted rules-based order
requires an understanding of the international system's evolution since
the second world war. In the aftermath of the conflict, its victors set
up a system of collective security focused on the United Nations and
based on the principles of the prohibition of aggression and the
peaceful settlement of disputes. As the cold war began, the US took the
lead in establishing an alliance system that aimed to shore up
democratic capitalism among its European allies by containing the
advance of communism, liberalising trade with US allies, and promoting
economic stability through international institutions.\[1\] This system
could be described as "liberal order 1.0". Although American leaders
often presented themselves as defending the free world, some countries
that the US supported -- especially beyond the "core" of western Europe,
Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand -- were more obviously
capitalist and anti-communist than democratic. This order largely
stopped at the borders of states and was less concerned about how they
exercised sovereignty internally.

After the end of the cold war in 1989, the system evolved. The US
promoted the development of a new settlement during the 1990s and early
2000s, creating what can be described as "liberal order 2.0". The
guiding idea was that the principled order established in the West after
the second world war would be progressively rolled out to states not
originally included. At the same time, in large part under European
impetus, there was a deepening of the order to take account of the
rights of individuals as well as states, and a partial embrace of a more
constrained idea of sovereignty.

This second phase of liberal international order was not only a system
of rules and institutions, but also a bet. It involved an expanded
system of trade rules based on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and
mechanisms for enhancing economic coordination through international
financial institutions and the G8. There were also gestures towards a
greater commitment to human rights through institutions such as the
International Criminal Court (ICC) and the norm of the responsibility to
protect civilians from large-scale violence. The bet was that countries
of the former Soviet Union and emerging powers such as China would
converge on a basic minimum of liberal norms, and that global security
cooperation through the UN could focus on new goals such as averting
mass atrocities or suppressing international terrorism.

The problem now is that, while the goal of knitting the world together
economically has been achieved, the bet on the consequences of this
integration has not paid off. Non-Western powers have gained in wealth
and global influence; however, there has been a decline in liberal
democracy. At the same time, the supposed defenders of liberal order
implemented its principles in ways that were sometimes self-interested
or inconsistent, forfeiting the support of even emerging democracies
while failing to convince their own populations of the benefits of
internationalism.\[2\] The liberal international order turned out to be
a work in progress that was capable of regression. More precisely, the
aspirational goals embodied in the ideal of liberal international order
are being challenged on three axes:

Externally, many countries that were supposed to join the system are
instead using their influence to pursue an old vision of great power
politics in new ways; these states include China, Russia, Iran, Saudi
Arabia, and Turkey.\[3\] As the distribution of power shifts, even
emerging democracies look at the world through a post-colonial mindset
rather than a post-cold war one -- and they are unwilling to endorse an
order that they see as linked to the dominance of the US and the West
more broadly. For these powers, the liberal international order looks
like "the world imperialism made", in the words of the writer Pankaj
Mishra.\[4\]

Internally, the bargain that supported liberal foreign policies has come
apart. Many citizens in the West now see openness and international
engagement as working against their interests -- as reflected in
declining support for liberal internationalism in European countries.
This public disenchantment lies behind the United States' willingness to
maintain its traditional role as the military and economic anchor of the
system -- as shown in Trump's dramatic policy reversals.

Transnationally, new challenges and forms of disorder have emerged that
current structures fail to address, necessitating the development of new
norms. Changes in the nature of conflict threaten to loosen the
international rule of law; there are no adequate regimes for dealing
with migration and refugees; and the regulation of cyberspace has failed
to keep pace with its impact on people's lives.

One interpretation of these developments is that the guardians of world
order over-reached in the years after 1989. The rise of sovereigntist
powers such as Russia and China, and liberal countries' actions that
undermined the legitimacy of the system, halted the utopian project of
building liberal order 2.0. Partly due to the calamity of the 2003
US-led invasion of Iraq, the onset of the financial crisis in 2007-2008,
and the subsequent travails of the euro, support for liberal order 2.0
will collapse. In its place there will be a return to a "thinner"
international order -- closer to liberal order 1.0 -- that strips out
any orientation towards human rights and democracy, focusing more on
non-intervention and minimal rules of coexistence between great powers
with different political visions. In this account, Trump does not
represent a major break with past US administrations. Very few of them
believed that the US should be subject to binding rules -- they were
just keener to impose them on other countries.

But there is a darker reading of our situation. In this view, **[we will
face [a rollback of]{.mark}]{.underline}** even **[[liberal
order]{.underline}]{.mark}** 1.0, driven not just by revisionist
external powers but also by a political counter-revolution within the
West. A new kind of globalisation -- "world order 0.5" -- **[[will
combine the tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies **[[of the future
with]{.mark} the [enmities of the past]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Military
interventions will continue, but not in the humanitarian form that saw
Western powers curtail genocide in Kosovo and Sierra Leone. The
**[[development of tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology **[[will
spur]{.mark} a series of [connectivity wars as states]{.mark} [weaponise
trade, the internet]{.mark}, and [even
migration]{.mark}.]{.underline}**\[5\] In this world, **[[multilateral
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** and regimes **[[will become
battlegrounds rather than brakes on conflict]{.mark}. Domestic politics
that increasingly revolves around]{.underline}** identity politics,
distrust of institutions, and **[[nationalism will foster greater
international conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[The task for Europe is to find an alternative]{.mark} to
these]{.underline}** two **[regressive scenarios]{.underline}**, one
that accounts for both the rising influence of illiberal powers and the
extent of global connectivity, and that European citizens can endorse.
**[[This will mean]{.mark} finding [principles of order that can]{.mark}
be effective in a multipolar world while working to [advance progressive
solutions to global problems]{.mark}]{.underline}** as far as possible
**[[and craft a new]{.mark} social and [economic
compact]{.mark}]{.underline}** within Europe's borders. Pursuing this
vision will require Europe to differentiate between the separate
components of international order, matching priorities to capacities in
different areas. **[It will]{.underline}** also **[mean developing [a
specifically European strategy]{.mark} on international
order.]{.underline}**

Much discussion of the fate of liberal international order has come from
analysts in the US and has adopted a US perspective. It tends to focus
on promoting internationalist stances within the US policy debate.\[6\]
But, while Europe and the US were closely aligned on questions of global
order during the cold war, their interests today are more divergent.
**[[Europe has]{.mark} greater exposure to the effects of conflicts to
its east and south, different economic concerns and regulatory
standards, and [a political culture]{.mark} that is [much more accepting
of multilateralism]{.mark} and international judicial oversight. [The EU
may be better placed than the US to]{.mark} distinguish between the
[preserv]{.mark}ation of [a rules-based system]{.mark} and the
maintenance of the US military and economic hegemony]{.underline}** that
has supported the liberal order up until now.\[7\] And Europe must
adjust to the shifts in US policy that Trump has made -- including his
rejection of the Iran nuclear deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA), which the EU saw as one of its main diplomatic successes
of recent years.

The effort to renew the foundations of international order should also
incorporate a clear vision of its underlying purpose. The idea that
internationalism has benefited some groups or countries unequally, and
that interconnection is a source of more threats than opportunities,
lies behind the loss of support for multilateralism. In this sense,
Europe must construct a renewed order on the basis of the needs and
concerns that it addresses. In the way that French president Emmanuel
Macron has called for a "Europe that protects", the EU should seek to
promote a "multilateralism that protects", showing more clearly how the
elements of international order that it prioritises work to the benefit
of European citizens' security and prosperity.

**[Europe should adopt a three-dimensional strategy on the future of
international order:]{.underline}**

**[The EU must invest in defending liberal order 2.0 within the European
sphere. This involves an attempt to strengthen the EU's defences and
resilience across several policy areas]{.underline}**, as well as an
effort to strike a new bargain between losers and winners within the EU.

[Beyond Europe, the EU should explore ways to develop an adapted version
of a principled, rules-based order. Because the EU cannot (and would not
want to) close itself off from the world, it should work to, as far as
possible, establish the kind of order it sees as the best foundation for
long-term stability and development in Europe and elsewhere. To do this,
it will have to identify a wide range of potential partners and be
prepared to rethink some of the supposed premises of liberal order
2.0.]{.underline}

On a global level, there are areas in which the EU will need to
prioritise a minimal threshold of rules-based order over any more
ambitious attempt to promote liberal goals. Because even a renewed
coalition of like-minded states cannot achieve its objectives in the
face of more assertive and powerful illiberal states, this may involve
compromising on European ideals in some cases and pulling back to a more
sovereigntist agenda.

Given that the international order is not monolithic, we can identify
priorities for Europe by breaking down the challenges it faces into four
thematic areas. Two of them -- security and trade -- involve central
features of the existing order that are increasingly under strain. In
the other two -- the global challenges of migration and climate change,
and cyberspace -- the existing order is underdeveloped and Europe needs
to work with others to help build new regimes.

War, crisis management, and human rights

It is often said that recent years have seen the return of geopolitics,
led by a newly assertive Russia and China. Both countries have
challenged existing regional settlements, albeit in different ways.
Russia's actions in Ukraine, including its annexation of Crimea,
attacked the post-cold war dispensation in Europe and the principle that
states should not acquire territory through force. In other areas,
Russia has sought to project its power through grey-area interventions
or through support for allies such as the Syrian regime. Russia aims to
limit the advance of Western institutions and norms in its
neighbourhood, and to promote an order based on realpolitik rather than
liberal principles.\[8\] China has acted forcefully to pursue what it
regards as core interests in its maritime neighbourhood, including
through extensive land reclamation in the South China Sea. It rejected a
ruling against it from the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague,
and has pursued a strategy of legal ambiguity about its maritime
claims.\[9\] China has dramatically increased its defence capabilities
in recent years with the apparent goal of achieving military parity with
the US, if not dominance, in east Asia.

This newly competitive environment emerged as Western enthusiasm for
military intervention waned in the aftermath of costly and unsuccessful
wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Barack Obama shifted the US in
the direction of "light footprint" (albeit extensive) counter-terrorism
operations; Trump has followed the same approach, while stepping up the
level of force involved. Beyond their lack of success, the United
States' wars in the Middle East and south Asia also undercut its claims
that it was upholding a principled, rules-based international order.
Even within the West, many people believed that the invasion of Iraq was
an act of aggression. Many emerging democracies thought that Western
military action in Libya in 2011 went beyond the Security Council's
authorisation of the use of force for civilian protection, and became an
illegitimate campaign aimed at regime change. The fallout from the Libya
operation was one factor in emerging democracies' decision to abstain in
the UN General Assembly vote on Ukraine in March 2014, as they wanted to
distance themselves from what they saw as the double standards of
Western powers.\[10\]

The military priorities of Western states have also diverged since the
end of the cold war. The US does not believe that it needs to invest as
heavily in the defence of Europe as it once did, and has a much lower
stake than the EU in the stability of Europe's eastern and southern
neighbourhoods.\[11\] Early doubts about Trump's commitment to NATO have
subsided for the moment, while his administration has published a
National Security Strategy that focuses heavily on renewed great power
competition. Under Trump, the military part of the Western alliance has
fared better than many people feared it would during the early months of
his presidency.\[12\] Resisting Russian and Chinese assertiveness --
including through the use of sanctions and actions to reinforce the
principle of freedom of navigation in open waters -- remains a viable
Western strategy under US leadership. Indeed, it is disconcertingly
unclear whether Europe should worry more about US hawkishness towards or
accommodation of rival powers. Nevertheless, Trump could change his mind
on Russia (though this would meet with serious opposition in Washington)
or take steps to further weaken the US system of alliances in east Asia.
Either way, Europe will have to take more responsibility for its own
defence -- as a condition of continued US engagement, and to promote its
interests by helping stabilise neighbouring regions.

Together, these trends point towards a more limited vision of
international order than some people hoped for after the end of the cold
war. In the 1990s, many Europeans came to see sovereignty as an
occasionally regrettable constraint on intervention to halt mass
atrocities and efforts to bring those responsible to justice. Now, at a
time of assertive rival powers and widespread disorder that is often
fuelled by external intervention, it seems more of a priority to reduce
the threat or use of force across state borders in violation of the UN
Charter. Russian and Chinese opposition means that Western-led military
intervention against a state oppressing its own people would be unlikely
to gain Security Council authorisation -- and could undermine the
international rule of law at the same time as it sought to uphold
international norms.\[13\] It may also be harder to win Security Council
approval for referrals to the ICC. While the court will continue to play
a role in global politics (particularly in cases involving countries
that are party to it), the EU should temper its expectations that the
ICC will, in the short term, bring members of hostile regimes to justice
or have significant influence on active conflicts.

[In a world in which great powers embrace a range of different value
systems, the EU would be more able to sustain international order if it
shifted back towards emphasising the value of sovereignty]{.underline}.
In the categories of the Danish political scientist Georg Sørensen, this
would mean prioritising a "liberalism of restraint" above a "liberalism
of imposition".\[14\] The former approach would be more likely to win
support from non-Western democracies and to make it easier to build
broad coalitions for Western efforts to constrain the use or threat of
force by other powers. It would also accommodate the reality that, in a
more competitive geopolitical environment, the West will be less able to
dictate the terms on which conflicts are settled and may have to accept
an imperfect and illiberal peace as the price for ending violence.\[15\]
This effect is clearly visible in the case of Syria: it is hard to see
how any peace agreement will involve President Bashar al-Assad's swift
departure from power or measures to bring regime officials to trial for
war crimes.

Against this background, [Europeans may need to fight a fallback
campaign to try to keep their humanitarian vision of multilateralism
alive in other ways. The most important is through diplomacy and
mediation.]{.underline} Despite attempting to organise a summit with
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Trump's strongest effect on
international politics has occurred through his rejection of predictable
and consistent negotiations aimed at reducing international tensions.
Trump's abandonment of the JCPOA, decision to move the US embassy in
Israel to Jerusalem, and apparent embrace of Saudi Arabia's hard line on
Iran are making the Middle East more volatile. The shift in US policy
has created a global diplomacy deficit, and the EU should make it a
priority to try to fill this gap. In the short term, this means trying
to save the JCPOA by encouraging Iran to stay within the deal while
trying to limit the effect of renewed US sanctions on European
companies.\[16\] Beyond this, the EU may need to think creatively about
how to bolster the global non-proliferation regime and make a greater
effort to de-escalate tensions and promote peace in conflicts from Yemen
to Ukraine.

The EU should also fight to support humanitarian and human rights
principles within the UN system, at a time when they are increasingly
being challenged.\[17\] Even in conflicts in which great powers are not
involved through the support of proxies, the Security Council is finding
it harder to agree on peacekeeping interventions.\[18\] Meanwhile, China
has become increasingly active at the UN in promoting a state-centric
vision of human rights and in limiting the organisation's human rights
activities through budget cuts.\[19\] With a US administration that is
less committed to multilateralism than its predecessor, it is up to
Europe to try to build broad coalitions that can counteract these
trends. The EU should also work with like-minded countries to reinforce
standards for upholding the rule of law in armed conflict.\[20\] This
effort is especially important at a time when widespread violations of
international humanitarian law, the growing role of non-state groups as
government proxies, and the evolution of transnational counter-terrorism
campaigns -- many of which rely on armed drones -- are eroding these
standards.\[21\]

The EU will be best able to fight a normative battle against the
conceptions of international order presented by Russia, China, and
perhaps the US if it presents a convincing case for its own model.
Strengthening the EU's internal cohesion and resolving cleavages within
European countries will allow the EU to be more resilient in the face of
external campaigns of disruption.

Trade and investment

The development of open, rules-based economic interaction between states
is at the heart of the European vision of international order. Taken as
a whole, the growth in international trade since the second world war
has had impressive economic benefits. Between 1950 and 2015, global
average real income per head rose nearly fivefold, and the proportion of
the world's population in extreme poverty fell from 72 percent to 10
percent.\[22\] In the decades following the 1980s, there was a
particularly large increase in cross-border flows of goods, services,
and finance.\[23\] But it is now clear that the Western-led economic
order has been, in one sense, too successful and, at the same time, not
successful enough.\[24\] The rising wealth of the developing world has
made the West's dominant role in the economic order unsustainable.
Meanwhile, the gains from the market-driven globalisation of recent
decades were unequally distributed in a way that has undermined the
legitimacy of the entire order.

The liberal order put in place after the second world war was meant to
provide an international infrastructure that allowed states to pursue
progressive policies at home. The corollary of an open world economy was
that governments would stabilise and protect market economies at home
through the development of welfare states.\[25\] However, in the last
two decades, as globalisation has accelerated, this link appeared to
break. Many Europeans and Americans now see economic openness as
benefiting emerging economies and privileged Westerners at the expense
of large sectors of the Western working and middle classes (although, in
much of Europe, the persistence of social spending moderates this
effect). While many economists believe that technological change drives
much of the loss of manufacturing jobs in Western societies, recent
research suggests that the entrance of China and other emerging
economies into the global trading system has also contributed
significantly.

Trump has acted on this perception by withdrawing the US from the
Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and calling for the
renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. More
alarmingly for Europe, he has also moved to undermine the essential
basis of the rules-based multilateral trading system by attacking the
WTO. Trump has repeatedly called the WTO a "disaster" for the US.\[26\]
Under his leadership, the US has held up the appointment of judges to
the WTO's appellate body, threatening to bring the organisation's
dispute settlement mechanism to a halt. Trump has also imposed
unilateral tariffs on steel and aluminium under a spurious "national
security" justification that weakens the system's credibility, and
promised further tariffs aimed at China without following WTO procedures
-- raising fears of an all-out trade war between the world's two leading
economies.

The irony is that Trump's pushback against free trade comes at a time
when there is growing acceptance in both Europe and the US that China
has exploited the international trading system to its advantage.\[27\]
China's accession to the WTO did not lead to further steps in the
progressive opening of its economy, and the WTO system has proved
unsuccessful in regulating asymmetries in China's approach to trade as
the country's income has increased. The EU, the US, and other economic
powers such as Japan might still be able to work together within the WTO
rules to seek greater reciprocity in economic relations with China. But
faced with a threat to the equal-access trading regime of the WTO, the
EU's priority should be preserving the rules-based system.\[28\] The EU
should combine its offer to work with the US in correcting imbalances in
global trade with a clear statement that it would oppose moves designed
to weaken the WTO. The size of the EU market gives it the power to stand
up credibly to the US if need be.

In any case, many of Trump's complaints are backward-looking and fail to
address the most urgent current concerns. Shifting patterns of global
trade, including the growth of global supply chains, have brought new
issues such as investment and trade in intermediate goods and services
to the top of the agenda.\[29\] An earlier ECFR report suggested that
the construction of an EU-wide system of investment screening is now the
priority in European economic relations with China.\[30\] These issues
have been the focus of a wave of bilateral and regional treaties that
provide the EU with the opportunity to pursue a vision of international
trade that protects its values. European participation in recent
bilateral or regional treaties is predicated on their inclusion of
regulatory standards in areas such as labour rights, environmental
standards, and data protection. In this way, these treaties add an
additional layer of social protection to the WTO system -- although
critics suggest their impact has been limited so far.\[31\]

At the same time, as an economic heavyweight the EU is able to
unilaterally create regulatory standards that exert a broader
international influence through what has been called the "Brussels
effect".\[32\] The European market is so large that many exporters
around the world voluntarily and comprehensively comply with the
standards it sets in areas such as food safety, consumer protection,
chemicals, and airline emissions. This is because it is often too costly
to manufacture different product lines for different markets.

Yet, in other ways, the EU has been forced to come to terms with the
fragmentation of the international economic order as non-Western powers,
led by China, increase their influence. The creation of institutions
such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the
BRICS-based New Development Bank has challenged the role of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Indeed, the veto
power that China holds in the AIIB through its voting share mirrors the
role of the US in the IMF. According to their supporters, these
organisations complement rather than replace traditional international
financial institutions for emerging powers, which gain access to bodies
more focused on their needs.\[33\]

Western observers feared that these new financial institutions would
undercut the conditionality of the World Bank and the IMF by lending
without imposing requirements in areas such as governance and
transparency. However, there is growing recognition that the record so
far is more nuanced, with the AIIB having aligned more closely than
expected with the policies and standards of traditional multilateral
development banks.\[34\] Moreover, Western development assistance has
sometimes promoted human rights standards more in rhetoric than reality.
There seems greater reason for concern about China's Belt and Road
Initiative, which appears tied to a narrower vision of Chinese economic
and strategic advantage.\[35\] Nevertheless, as reflected in the reach
of this initiative, China's economic power is too substantial to be
contained by European policy

Global challenges: Migration and climate change

Even when the liberal international order was at it strongest, there
were some areas in which it clearly remained incomplete. One of its most
obvious weaknesses was that it did not include an adequate regime for
governing the large-scale movement of people across borders. Refugees
have continued to suffer from a lack of international protection, and
there has never been an effective framework that allocates
responsibility for meeting their needs. The 1951 Refugee Convention
established the principle of non-refoulement, which protects refugees
from forcible return to a country in which they would face persecution.
This principle remains at the core of refugee protection but, in other
respects, the convention has proven increasingly unfit to cope with
changing patterns of displacement. The convention only covers those who
are fleeing persecution (as opposed to, for instance, endemic disorder
or natural disaster); is geared towards the provision of relief rather
than more long-term opportunities; and leaves countries that refugees
reach first to bear most of the responsibility for helping them.\[36\]
This regime is now struggling to deal with the highest level of
displacement in the history of the convention. Most refugees live in a
small number of developing countries, which cannot afford to provide
them with the services and economic opportunities they need.

More broadly, there has been a rapid increase in migration worldwide in
the last two decades, in line with the development of other facets of
globalisation, such transportation and communication. In 2017, there
were an estimated 258 million international migrants, accounting for 3.4
percent of the global population.\[37\] No issue has done more than
migration to make citizens of Western countries see international
openness as a threat rather than a source of opportunities. This trend
has increasingly driven governments in the developed world to adopt an
approach to irregular migration that aims to, as far as possible, deter
asylum seekers and other migrants from reaching their countries. They
have done so by exploiting gaps in the regime of international
protection, complying with the law while leaving vulnerable people with
inadequate protection.\[38\] There is a need for an international regime
that offers better prospects to those who are forcibly displaced, but
that does so in a way that is politically sustainable among electorates
in developed democracies.

The classic multilateral method of addressing global challenges such as
mass displacement is to negotiate a new international treaty that
imposes binding responsibilities on all parties. But in the case of
refugees and migration, this path appears blocked. States have no
appetite for taking on new responsibilities under the Refugee
Convention, and few developed countries have signed the UN Convention on
the Rights of Migrant Workers. The Refugee Convention's definition of
refugees is plainly insufficient, but it is likely that opening the
convention to renegotiation would lead to fewer protections.\[39\]
Instead, the most promising path towards collective action on migration
seems to lie in a newer and more informal vision of global governance
based on pragmatism, voluntary adherence, and a diversity of responsible
actors.

This year, UN member states are due to adopt two global compacts on
refugees and migration respectively -- non-binding frameworks that aim
to set out guiding principles for collective action. They will be based
on the 2016 New York Declaration, which reaffirmed that protecting
refugees is a shared international responsibility and pledged "robust
support" to countries affected by large-scale migration. This approach
builds on the Nansen Initiative on migration caused by natural
disasters. Led by a coalition of states from different regions -- with
the extensive involvement of civil society groups, businesses, and other
organisations -- the initiative produced an Agenda for Protection that
has been widely endorsed.\[40\] Following this model, refugee and
development scholars Alexander Betts and Paul Collier have called for an
approach to refugee protection based on pragmatic partnerships involving
both states and non-state actors rather than a new or revised legally
binding instrument.\[41\] Similarly, political theorist Michael
Ignatieff has identified the response to refugees as exemplifying "a
genuine crisis of the universal amidst a return of the sovereign",
arguing that an approach based on generosity and compassion will be more
effective than one based on legal obligation.\[42\] In his words,
"maintaining public support to assist strangers and refugees is more
likely to succeed if the appeal is cast in the language of the gift,
rather than the language of rights".\[43\]

There is a precedent for this kind of an inclusive, voluntary approach
to global governance in the world's response to the other great
collective challenge of our time: climate change.\[44\] Climate change
has long spurred migration, an effect that will likely become
increasingly apparent as temperatures and sea levels rise. In 2015, a
worldwide "high-ambition coalition" of states forged the 21st Conference
of Parties (COP21) agreement as a hybrid model combining voluntary
national commitments with obligations on transparency and
reporting.\[45\] Based on the aspirational principle that parties will
increase their commitments over time, the agreement includes a
significant role for non-state entities such as businesses, civil
society groups, and local governments. These diverse participants will
help the COP21 regime survive Trump's decision to withdraw the US from
the agreement (just as he withdrew it from negotiations on the Global
Compact for Migration). The "We Are Still In" collection of US states,
cities, and businesses that have pledged to continue working towards the
US commitment under COP21 would, if treated as a country, have the
world's third-largest economy (after the wider US and China).\[46\]

This evolving approach to global governance has won support from both
the West and emerging powers such as India and China due to its
voluntary nature and its embrace of the principle of "common but
differentiated responsibilities".\[47\] The EU can contribute to its
success first and foremost by setting an example, adhering to its
targets, and embracing a share of global responsibilities that will be
seen as fair. On migration, this will require the EU to find a
sustainable balance between showing Europeans that it can control
Europe's borders while offering some legal pathways for immigration. The
aim should be to present immigration as a managed and fair process that
meets European needs rather than as something to be halted at all costs.
At the same time, the EU should increase investment in education and
family planning to try to limit population growth in neighbouring
regions and hence reduce migratory pressure. On climate change, the EU
should supplement its current commitments with a carbon
border-adjustment tax to encourage adherence overseas, and make sure
that European businesses do not suffer for their efforts to cut
greenhouse gas emissions.

Cyberspace

Although policymakers often treat it as a self-contained domain,
cyberspace is a dimension of the contemporary world that cuts across all
the areas discussed in this report.\[48\] Indeed, cyber security
increasingly preoccupies governments everywhere. Having been largely
neglected in the early days of the internet, cyber security concerns
have become increasingly prominent in recent years due to attacks on
countries' infrastructure, commercial enterprises, and elections. At the
same time, the internet is revolutionising the global economy: it is the
world's most important piece of infrastructure and is set to underpin
all infrastructure.\[49\] Having evolved in a lightly regulated way, the
internet has now become the focus of a global debate about the norms
that should govern its operations, as people take in the revolutionary
impact it is having on both governance and individuals' private lives.

The governance of cyberspace is an important part of the international
order -- one in which the principles of openness, security, and
inclusivity are at stake.\[50\] The revelations about data surveillance
by the US National Security Agency and other intelligence services, and
of the use of data gathered by Facebook, Google, and other companies,
has eroded users' trust in the protection of their privacy online. A
handful of companies based in the US now constitute a vital part of the
public sphere in countries around the world, and unaccountable
algorithms play a significant role in determining people's financial and
life opportunities.\[51\] At the same time, China's "Great Firewall" and
Russian efforts to control online content herald a future in which a
growing number of countries are likely to attempt to create segregated
national internets.\[52\] Efforts to agree on international principles
for state behaviour in cyberspace through a UN-sponsored process have
faltered.\[53\] There is a danger that the global nature of the
internet, with all the advantages it has for economic growth and free
expression, could be further undermined if people in democratic states
come to see online connectivity as a more of a threat than a source of
opportunities.

It would fit well with the EU's interests and values to take a leading
role in promoting a liberal internet that remains open but offers better
protection for users and national security. Europe can stake out a
global position that counterbalances both the Sino-Russian sovereigntist
approach and US acquiescence to the loosely regulated operation of
digital monopolies.\[54\]

In one respect, the EU has already established itself as a global
standard-setter in internet regulation. Its General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), implemented in May 2018, provides EU citizens with
greater control over how companies around the world handle their data.
In an example of the Brussels effect described above, some non-European
companies have adopted these rules for all their customers, while some
non-European countries have accepted the GDPR as the gold standard for
data protection.\[55\] Facebook said it would comply with the regulation
"in spirit" for all its customers, although it also gave itself the
option of applying looser rules for non-European users by transferring
their contracts away from the company's international headquarters in
Ireland. The European Commission has also begun to develop a policy on
"fake news", centring on a call for companies to adopt a voluntary code
of conduct on online disinformation.\[56\]

Despite the importance of these measures, they still fall short of a
comprehensive approach that takes account of all the areas cyber policy
affects. Europe lacks an integrated vision of how to balance the often
competing demands of commercial interests, human rights, national
security, and public consent in internet governance.\[57\] For example,
it does not have a considered position on the extent to which political
actors should be allowed to exploit personal data. The EU essentially
treats personal data as a privacy issue, but it is also a resource that
potentially has enormous value to global public goods in areas such as
healthcare, security, and environmental protection. European countries
should work towards the development of an international system that
secures, while distributing the benefits of, personal data.\[58\]

The EU also has a key role as a supporter of the principle of
multi-stakeholder governance of the internet, in the face of new
developments such as the sharing economy and the internet of
things.\[59\] The US was a strong backer of the multi-stakeholder
principle under Obama, passing authority over domain name administrator
the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to a
multi-stakeholder coalition in 2016. But Trump has adopted a very
different line. There are indications that his administration may look
for ways to reverse the handover of ICANN (although it is unclear how
this could be achieved).\[60\] Since US advocacy was important in
persuading emerging democracies such as India, Brazil, and South Africa
to support a multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance, there is
a danger that the Trump administration's position will have an
international ripple effect.

In 2017, states taking part in the UN-sponsored Group of Governmental
Experts failed to reach an agreement on how international law applies to
offensive cyber operations -- particularly on states' legal right to
respond to cyber attacks. In any case, some of the states involved
appear to have ignored the norms agreed on earlier in the process,
including those on cyber attacks against critical infrastructure. In the
absence of international agreement, groups of like-minded states can
best advance the formation of norms by developing their own guidelines
on applying international law in this area. EU member states should
coordinate with allies and partners such as the United States,
Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Japan in developing standards that
can guide state practice on issues such as the definition of an armed
attack in cyberspace and the appropriate use of countermeasures.\[61\]
Some of the most difficult strategic questions raised by offensive cyber
operations concern actions that fall short of a conventional armed
attack yet rise above the level of intelligence operations because they
have an effect on political or commercial life. The challenges here
include defining the threshold at which an action counts as an unlawful
intervention, and finding a way to deter attacks that is both effective
and compatible with the principles of democratic, law-abiding societies.

Conclusion: Putting the defence of liberal order at the heart of the
European Global Strategy

[The EU can best support the preservation of a rules-based system by
promoting an adapted vision of international order that takes account of
recent developments and new challenges.]{.underline} The EU should place
an updated idea of liberal order at the centre of its Global Strategy,
and build the capacity to implement this strategy.

[In doing so, the EU should follow an approach that aims to reconcile
some of the tensions between sovereignty and international order that
have become problematic in recent years due to the rise of assertive
illiberal powers, inconsistencies in Western practice, and a pervasive
belief among Western electorates that globalisation is more a threat
than an opportunity.]{.underline} A liberal order reinvented along the
lines suggested above would offer greater recognition of the value of
sovereignty by strengthening constraints on unlawful intervention;
providing greater scope for Europe to reaffirm its standards through
regulation and trade; and accepting voluntary commitments as a basis for
some international agreements. [The EU would offset this with a
**renewed commitment to multilateralism** as the best way of securing
Europeans' security and prosperity; attempts to develop new norms for a
more connected world; and support for the inclusion of businesses and
civil society groups as participants in the order]{.underline}.\[62\]

In practical terms, this agenda gives rise to several priorities.
Firstly, the EU needs to focus on its resilience as the keystone of a
rules-based and liberal order. This involves major initiatives in
several areas:

Security: Step up defence spending while pooling and sharing resources,
to establish strategic autonomy at a time when the US commitment to
European security is fading. European countries could strengthen their
coordination within NATO by establishing a European caucus and outside
the organisation by developing intra-European coordination, particularly
through the nascent European Intervention Initiative.\[63\]

Economics: Invest in a new economic settlement at home to help those who
feel left behind by globalisation, while developing tougher measures to
stop China and other emerging players from creating an uneven playing
field, including through investment screening.

Migration: Build up the EU's ability to police its external border as a
complement to managed pathways for legal migration.

Internet governance: Introduce regulation that creates a better balance
between security, privacy rights, commercial opportunities, and the
welfare of society as a whole.

Secondly, Europe needs to help compensate for the global diplomacy
deficit by far more actively reaching out to other players, as well as
pushing for a mediation role in crises and conflicts in the European
neighbourhood:

Working in coordination with the European External Action Service
(EEAS), member states should reach out to other great powers and swing
states such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia on essential questions of
order -- and place the defence of the rules-based order at the heart of
EU summits and meetings.

The EU should make better use of its financial engagement with many of
the world's most troubled states -- including Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and
Ukraine -- to play a greater political role in support of stabilisation.

Thirdly, the EU should make greater use of its economic leverage to
preserve the rules-based order. In this, it should:

Support the COP21 agreement by further promoting trade deals that
incorporate environmental requirements, and by implementing a carbon
border-adjustment tax at the EU's borders.

Use the size of the EU market to define and export standards for better
regulation of the internet.

Create the space to establish decision-making power on questions of
order by pushing back against the extra-territoriality of US sanctions.
In the short term, the EU should take steps such as establishing euro
credit lines and special purpose vehicles to assist companies doing
business with Iran, while pursuing measures to reduce the impact of US
sanctions.\[64\] The EU should also set up an action task force that,
bringing together all relevant parts of EU institutions, explores
longer-term options for establishing greater financial independence from
the US.

Fourthly, the EU should develop a series of sectoral strategies for
preserving the rules-based order -- in trade, arms proliferation, and
environmental protection. These strategies should involve a set of
complementary instruments, including trade, defence, diplomacy,
development, financial, and regulatory tools. The EEAS should coordinate
the use of the tools, but sub-groups of member states should create
them. Such an approach would improve the links between EU institutions
and member states in these strategies.

To implement this agenda, the EU will need to overhaul its ways of
working. Internally, it will need to find a method for operating with
the flexibility and speed required for greater diplomatic engagement,
while keeping the collective weight of the EU behind its initiatives.
Coordinating EU efforts with the United Kingdom after Brexit will also
be important. Externally, **[[the EU will need to]{.underline}]{.mark}**
make an especially large investment in its relations with like-minded
powers. Conversely, it will need to **[[develop a more independent
posture towards the US]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The EU should continue to
cooperate with the US wherever possible, but **[it should put its
commitment to the rules-based order above its traditional instinct to
follow the American lead.]{.underline}**

Some Europeans will worry that an independent and sometimes defiant
attitude to the US will jeopardise the security relationship on which
the EU continues to depend. But Trump has shown clearly that he does not
reward concessions. Under his leadership, the United States' security
policy reflects its calculation of its own interests rather than any
concern for repaying allies' loyalty. **[[The EU can best
manage]{.underline}]{.mark}** its relationship with the US and its
support for **[[a rules-based international system if it]{.mark}
develops and [acts on a sense of itself as]{.mark} an
[independent]{.mark} strategic actor. [Europe needs to set its own
course]{.mark} to secure the world order it wants.]{.underline}**

**[[Europe]{.mark} [is]{.mark} generally seen as '[punching beneath its
weight]{.mark}.']{.underline}** Too often, it falls short of its own
ambitions, takes third place behind the US and China in international
affairs, and frequently lacks strategic ambitions. As a result, Europe
risks falling behind these other global powers. To explore options on
how to counteract this tendency, we developed a number of proposals for
enhancing Europe's soft and sharp power. While each measure can
certainly stand on its own merits, combining them to create synergies
will add to their overall effectiveness and impact: Internationalisation
of the euro and Sanctions. Enhancing the euro's role as a global reserve
currency is an important building block for an effective sanctions
repertoire. As the US is using the dollar's global importance to
strong‐arm countries into compliance, the EU could similarly use the
euro to increase the bite of its sanctions. Triggering sanctions could
involve the European data rating agency: if ratings for privacy are
below a certain threshold, companies could be denied access to European
markets or become subjects to fines. Erasmus Global, Smart Clusters, and
Culture Europe. The alumni network of Erasmus Global can be employed in
smart innovation clusters, thereby effectively serving as a recruiting
tool which funnels talent into relevant projects and creates
opportunities to keep foreign brain capital in Europe. Alumni activities
could also be supported by Culture Europe by providing opportunities for
exchange and local outreach. Digital Development Initiative, Smart
Clustering. The DDI could build on the smart clustering proposal by
creating digital hubs alongside a growing digital infrastructure, funded
by InvestEU. This would also address criticism directed at the Juncker
Plan's lack of geographical diversity (European Court of Auditors,
2019), as the DDI intends to establish infrastructure across the EU. As
the DDI aims to promote European standards beyond EU borders, the link
could counteract China's advances in digital authoritarianism (Shabaz,
2018). Irrespective of synergies that can be achieved by combining
measures, there are several implications that have come up repeatedly
and strongly in both the back‐casting exercise and the validations. If,
by 2030, Europe wants to become a self‐confident and united market
power, offering a democratic and socially inclusive alternative
globally, with economic growth, open trade and a rule‐based,
multilateral order, these implications offer crucial lessons. First,
despite significant advances in European coordination and integration,
**[[Europe continues to be fragmented]{.mark}, and the sum of its parts
(member states) appear less than the concord needed for enhancing its
sharp and soft power, and indeed what is needed to implement the
measures suggested here. [This]{.mark} fragmentation [applies]{.mark}
both internally, but [critically]{.mark} also [to]{.mark} [the way
Europe is perceived by China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the United
States, or indeed Russia. **[[Fragmentation equals
weakness,]{.mark}]{.underline}** and reducing it in key policy fields
should be a priority for the EU institutions, as well as the member
states. A related weakness is the procrastination often visible in
pursuing necessary reforms or in solving problems at home. Without
internal cohesion, external power projection will struggle. At some
point, **[[soft]{.mark} and sharp [power advances become ineffective
without]{.mark} being backed up with sufficient [hard power. With NATO
weakening,]{.mark} and with new security threats in Europe's
neighbourhood and in cyber space arising, [Europe needs to review
fundamentally how hard and sharp power relate to each other. Europe
needs]{.mark} to seek a better [balance.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Recent
initiatives like PESCO are useful first steps, but more is needed to
make the development of European hard power a pressing matter for debate
and policy action across relevant EU institutions and all member states.
What is more, Europe is simply not strategic enough. Geopolitically,
especially compared to China, Europe seems less focused on specific
parts of the world, lacking even a coherent approach to what the
Americans think of as the immediate 'back‐yard', and timid in linking
its strategic interests to economic interests and its values. In key
policy fields, Europe is less clear about its role and less willing to
act in its own interest than the US. However, the success of the GDPR
and regulatory actions to curb the power of digital near‐monopolies like
Facebook and Amazon have shown that Europe can act assertively, and that
it will be quickly recognised globally as doing so. This paper has
identified some of the key impediments to utilising the EU's potential
in its external relations. Such potential is realised when governments
forgo their autonomy (and weakness) for collective gains. This will
enable the EU to become more effective in meeting current public
aspirations on key policy agendas -- such as climate change, human
rights; etc. -- as signalled in the 2019 European elections, thereby
overcoming the 'capability‐expectations gap' (Hill, 1993). It will also
place the EU in a more proactive position in the face of current trends
and future threats. It is an agenda for the EU's own transformation as
an external actor. Indeed, in terms of sharp power, we suggest that
Europe needs to punch above its weight when necessary, and when called
for strategically. This more 'assertive Europe' should be balanced by
the 'ethical Europe' of its soft power. The measures proposed here offer
ways and means of achieving this vision.

#### It solves cyber threats -- the EU is an experienced player:

**[[Operational cooperation among European governments]{.mark} has
improved, with EU structures playing a growing role. [The EU's best
performance has been in]{.mark} the area of [cyber
crime]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where cooperation among national cyber

https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/strategic-compass-european-union-expands-its-toolbox)

Nevertheless, [[the EU needs to ensure that its mechanisms]{.mark}
contribute effectively [to transatlantic unity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Perhaps the most striking stipulation of the Strategic Compass is the
creation of a 5,000-strong force able to swiftly deploy to
non-permissive environments]{.underline}. The force is to include air,
land, and maritime components along with strategic enablers. It will be
enabled through the substantial modification of the EU Battlegroups and
the member-states that will participate with troops and capabilities
will be pre-identified.

[However, [NATO currently has the NATO Response Force (NRF) which can
start deploying globally]{.mark}]{.underline} within one to four weeks
and a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can start
deploying within two days. EU member-states that are also part of NATO
are major contributors to the NRF and VJTF[. Therefore, [there is risk
of **operational redundancy between the EU and NATO**'s
components.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Additionally, [[due to the high number of initiatives put forth]{.mark}
by the Strategic Compass [the risk of some of them falling behind
schedule or underdelivering is present]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Nevertheless, besides the obstacles ahead, the importance of the
document for the geopolitical future of the EU should not be
underestimated.

### EU S: Cyber---General

#### U.S. strategic influence in technology sectors decks any shot at safe and open cyberspace -- the EU is key.

**[Bradford 22]{.underline}** (Anu Bradford is a nonresident scholar in
the Europe Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
Raluca Csernatoni is a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe, where she

Transatlantic Relationship Has Evolved, One Year Into the Biden
Administration*", Carnegie Europe,
https://carnegieeurope.eu/2022/01/20/how-transatlantic-relationship-has-evolved-one-year-into-biden-administration-pub-86213)

After the friction-filled era under Trump, Europe has welcomed the new
U.S. administration with optimism. Consistent with Biden's lifelong
commitment to transatlanticism, [this past year has witnessed a shift in
U.S. diplomatic rhetoric, from outright hostility toward a more
normalized tone supporting enhanced EU-U.S. collaboration]{.underline}.
[This is also the case for the technological domain, with Washington
demonstrating its eagerness to build coalitions with European allies and
other techno-democracies to counter the rise of authoritarian
China.]{.underline}

Most concretely, [the Biden administration has been supportive of the
EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council (TTC)]{.underline}, which had its
inaugural meeting in September 2021 and serves as a forum for the EU and
United States to coordinate their trade and technology policy approaches
based on shared democratic values. **[The TTC offers a significant
opportunity to make progress in aligning transatlantic interests in
artificial intelligence regulation, technological standards setting,
security of supply chains, screening foreign direct investments and
exports, and increasing cybersecurity resilience.]{.underline}**

The TTC was launched in the shadow of the transatlantic drama over
AUKUS, so it is too early to tell whether it can successfully address
present and future tech challenges and renew the transatlantic bond.
[The AUKUS incident shows that for all the talk of revived
transatlanticism, the United States will act, as it always has, in its
own strategic interests.]{.underline} [AUKUS further confirms that China
takes center stage in U.S. geopolitical calculations, with the EU
risking to become an afterthought.]{.underline}

[There are also long-standing tensions between Brussels and Washington
regarding technology regulation.]{.underline} The United States has in
the past accused the EU of targeting U.S. tech companies with its
stringent antitrust and data protection rules. And it is now watching
closely how the EU's proposed Digital Markets Act and Digital Services
Act will affect U.S. interests. Transatlantic data flows also remain
precarious after the European Court of Justice has twice invalidated the
agreement that governed EU-U.S. data transfers.

However, the [U.S. policy conversation is now shifting closer to the EU,
with an increasing recognition in the country that big tech has become
too powerful.]{.underline} The Biden administration is looking to revive
antitrust enforcement against certain companies, while Congress is
debating more interventionist technology regulations targeting market
competition, privacy, and content moderation. These policy developments
suggest that [the transatlantic gap may be gradually closing, even
though it remains unclear whether this new rhetoric will translate into
actual policy change in the United States]{.underline}.

Building on these developments, [the EU should actively engage on its
own terms with the United States and other democratic countries around
shared values and norms regarding responsible technological innovation,
the preservation of an open and safe cyberspace, and the development of
human-centric disruptive technologies]{.underline}. Beyond leveraging
regulation, [the EU should also aim to operationalize its digital and
technological sovereignty in critical areas and build its open strategic
autonomy in the face of the growing tech rivalry between the United
States and China. This also means the creation of a more cohesive EU
external tech policy agenda to deal collectively with contested policy
choices]{.underline}, such as whether to welcome the Chinese tech
company Huawei to build 5G networks across Europe.

Yet the EU's pursuit to boost its homegrown technological and digital
capacity and to reduce dependencies on others, including the United
States, might raise concerns about growing protectionism and further
deepen the transatlantic rift. The EU may similarly be concerned that
the United States has engaged in protectionist actions in support of its
own high-tech industries, while publicly advocating the techno-globalism
promoted by big tech. **[To avoid shifts to techno-nationalism, both the
EU and United States should reject this emerging global norm and
recommit to open markets. To mitigate and counter the negative effects
of techno-nationalist policies,]{.underline}** **[the EU should promote
both new policy instruments for critical infrastructure protections in
the case of key strategic technologies and at the same time boost the
competitiveness of the European innovation ecosystem.]{.underline}**

**[Neither the EU nor the United States can safeguard their democratic,
economic, technological, and strategic interests alone. Instead, they
need to seize the opportunity the TTC presents to deepen EU-U.S. ties
and shape the global trade and technology policy toward their shared
values. There is no better path for preserving the liberal democratic
foundations of the global internet.]{.underline}**

#### The EU needs internal change to shore up cyber-defenses -- establishing formal cooperation mechanisms bolsters its influence

Should Do, Council on Foreign Relations,
https://www.cfr.org/blog/russias-cyber-war-whats-next-and-what-european-union-should-do)

What should the European Union do in the immediate term?

[The EU has adopted new frameworks, including its much vaunted Strategic
Compass, which, in the long term, will improve
cybersecurity]{.underline} in the bloc, and potentially reduce the risk
of catastrophic Russian cyberattacks. [However, the EU needs to take
more steps in the short term to shore up cyber defenses and mitigate the
threat of Russian cyber operations.]{.underline}

First, **[the EU should get its own house in order]{.underline}**. The
revised Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive--better known
in Brussels circles as NIS 2--should be finalized in the coming months
and will aim to further strengthen the security of supply chains,
streamline incident reporting obligations, and introduce more stringent
supervisory measures for a large number of operators of essential
services and enterprises across the EU. [While NIS 2 represents a step
in the right direction, the EU still has some way to go in implementing
harmonized cybersecurity rules across the bloc's own
institutions]{.underline}.

[Second, the EU and its Member States have a role to play in
discouraging and deterring cyberattacks by demonstrating a willingness
to act and impose costs on perpetrators]{.underline}. The first-ever
operational deployment of the EU's Cyber Rapid Response Team to Ukraine,
alongside similar teams from the United States, was a welcome signal in
this respect. [One way to impose further costs would be by pushing for
coordinated attribution of cyberattacks at the EU-level]{.underline}.
[On the offensive and deterrent side, the EU should adopt a pooling of
capabilities on a voluntary basis.]{.underline} Similar programs already
exist among other groups, such as NATO's Sovereign Cyber Effects
Provided Voluntarily by Allies (SCEPVA) program, which the EU could use
as a model for its own programs.

[Third, the EU should ensure it is better prepared by leveraging the
tools it already has at its disposal.]{.underline} Intelligence sharing
and situational awareness have proven vital before and during the war in
Ukraine, but [the future effectiveness of these strategies in deterring
and mitigating cyberattacks will be reliant on Member States willingness
to contribute with timely and actionable intelligence.]{.underline} In
the short term, the Cyber Crisis Liaison Organisation Network (CyCLONe),
a recently created group bringing together the executives of the EU's
twenty seven national cybersecurity authorities, should be used to its
full capability and integrated with the rest of the EU cyber ecosystem.
CyCLONe, with their wealth of operational-level expertise, should be
able to brief political decision-makers in the Council more frequently.
[On the military side, the EU still lacks a fully fleshed-out
cooperation mechanism for military cybersecurity alerts, despite this
being an objective since the 2014 EU Cyber Defence Policy Framework.
Ensuring cooperation among both civilian and military groups is vital
given the specter of Russian cyberattacks.]{.underline}

**[National authorities have legislative and regulatory
powe]{.underline}**rs but little few direct controls to influence or
steer supply in the private/commercial sector, other than in an
emergency situation. As **[the system seems to work
efficiently]{.underline}**, there has been little incentive for national
authorities to engage directly. Instead, **[it has been left mainly to
industry to resolve any supply shortfalls]{.underline}**. For
**[government, the focus has been on ensuring safety and quality levels
of goods and services]{.underline}**, particularly of food and other
consumables.

The European Union (**[EU) plays a very strong role in the public
administration architecture for these sectors. EU directives and
regulation have substantially shaped the planning by its member states,
as well as by the commercial sector. Contingency planning, which seeks
to ensure the functioning and maintenance of operations, has focused
predominantly on the ability to deal with the most probable disruptive
incidents in the short term. The commercial sector has mainly focused on
minimising their own costs given such a disruption, rather than
preparing for larger-scale contingencies with cascading effects across
sectors and society itself]{.underline}**.

Information Society Council that [meets with stakeholders]{.mark} from
the private, public, military, and civilian sectors [at the highest
executive level to directly exchange digital threat
information]{.mark}]{.underline}**.35 As sectors become more dependent
on data flows, the Information Society Council can dynamically react to
changes in threats. The following recommendations draw on the Baltic
experience to expand channels for the United States and the EU to find
common ground for realignment across divergent data governance and
cybersecurity regimes. These channels may be helpful in lessening
divergences in practical cyber threat aversion, and may aid in normative
alignment.

**[I. [Establish and Advance National Cybersecurity Councils for
Critical Functions]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[National cybersecurity councils are common across the Baltic states.
Generally, [these function as informal or formal councils]{.mark} that
convene representatives of military and civilian, private and public
sector participants from critical sectors, and increasingly --- critical
functions that underpin the aforementioned]{.underline}. These councils
collect holistic information on the state of cybersecurity across
sectors, and are the only funnel of such information. (In the United
States, the equivalent is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's
Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC), which has
authorities from 16 critical infrastructure sectors.)36 [The findings of
these cross-sectoral councils are increasingly critical to the
development of transatlantic cybersecurity. [A similar council should be
established at the international level, between the United States and
the EU,]{.mark} [dedicating a channel to negotiate]{.mark} the [security
regimes]{.mark} of shared transatlantic critical functions, like
ensuring the smooth operation of international finance or even
maintaining internet infrastructure.]{.underline}

**[II. [Advance Threat Information Sharing Channels]{.mark} Under the
U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council]{.underline}**

[President Biden's administration and EU leaders have both signaled
commitments to renew the transatlantic partnership, especially in the
digital arena, as highlighted by the recent formation of the U.S.-EU
Trade and Technology Council]{.underline}.37 Of the 10 working groups
within the council, four are working in the ambit of cybersecurity.38
[These [working groups should be used as a platform to advance cyber
threat information sharing]{.mark}, [providing a direct forum to
channel]{.mark} the [info]{.mark}rmation from ENISA, NIST, and other
national sectoral stakeholders. The aim of such a channel should be to
triangulate the highest cybersecurity priorities, [which should then
branch off into more subsidiary cooperation channels]{.mark} with a
feedback loop to higher, more senior executive levels.]{.underline}

**[III. [Conflate Civilian and Military Cybersecurity Experience via the
EU's Joint Cyber Unit]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[U.S.-EU cybersecurity experience sharing is segmented between civilian
and military sectors. However, the type of cyber threats both sectors
share are increasingly similar and costly.]{.underline} The recent
proposal to create an EU [[Joint Cyber Unit that will coordinate, share
knowledge, and provide advanced warnings]{.mark} will draw together
operational groups' national cybersecurity authorities]{.underline}
(CERTS), national defense authorities (military CERTs), and EU
structures (ENISA and the Permanent Structured Cooperation; PESCO),
among others.39 This Joint Cyber Unit [[can act as the mirror partner to
the United States]{.mark}, which already has military and civilian
sectors sharing risks via the Cyber Unified Coordination Group. The
partnership between the United States and the EU in this capacity can
take place via the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, or a separate
channel.]{.underline}

WANTED: A WESTERN DIGITAL ALLIANCE

[[The linear nature of the industrial economy has been replaced
with]{.underline}]{.mark} an exponential economy based on the build-once
nature of digital products coupled with the deliver-everywhere
capability of [[the internet. If]{.mark} nation-specific, or
region-specific rules were [to disassemble that]{.mark} economic
phenomenon, it [would]{.mark} not only [be a]{.mark} step back in time,
but also a [blow to the economies of the world]{.mark}, including the
dominant digital platforms based in the United States]{.underline}. At
the very time when the wisdom of the mid-20th century leaders to create
Western alliances is being reinforced, [the digital policy actions by
the Europeans -- both the EU and UK -- create an opportunity for similar
21st century leadership]{.underline}. A few weeks after D-Day, while the
Second World War was still raging, Western democracies came together to
determine their collective economic future. At the foot of New
Hampshire's Mt. Washington, they established the Bretton Woods Agreement
and set the rules for the commercial and financial relations of the
post-war world. The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference,
the gathering's official name, convened amidst transatlantic economic
divisions not dissimilar to those of today. The United States' stronger
trade position---a position not unlike the strength of its digital
economy today---encouraged the U.S. to prioritize free trade and fixed
exchange rates. The other nations, with the UK in the lead, wanted
policies to reflect their trade deficits and the need for rate
flexibility. The result was a compromise of fixed-but-adjustable
exchange rates. The conference also created two important international
institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and what would
become the World Bank. This is where the flood that started in Brussels
will inundate Washington. [[Western democracies must seize the moment
and form a similar alliance to oversee]{.mark} the [commercial
relations]{.mark} of the post-industrial world. [That the United States
has lost its leadership position through inaction will place it in an
unusual position]{.mark} of not bringing the strongest hand to the
bidding. Yet, for the dominant digital platforms domiciled in the U.S.,
the priority must be to protect the "build once, sell everywhere"
economics of the internet]{.underline}. [[The dominant digital platforms
lobbied the EU as actively]{.mark} as they have the U.S. Congress to
avoid regulatory oversight. As a result of the EU's decision, however,
the fight has been redefined. The opposition to regulation must now
transform from the protection of companies into the protection of the
interconnected market.]{.underline}

[In other words, that there will be rules has been
established]{.underline}. What is important now is to make those rules
work to protect consumers, competition, and the connected market. It is
time for [[a Western Digital Alliance that harmonizes the rules that
will govern the internet on both sides of the
Atlantic]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such harmonization does not mean the
policies must be identical, but that they are compatible. Herein lies
the art of the possible for the U.S. government, American platform
companies, and Western democracies. [Just as the digital companies must
be expected to consider the effects of their actions on the public
interest, so must the actions of sovereign nations be expected to
consider the effects of those actions on the interest of maintaining the
exponential economics of the internet. [To harm those economics in the
name of sovereignty would be to harm the economics for all]{.mark}.
Internet policy compatibility, as opposed to identicality, should
underpin the new Western Digital Alliance.]{.underline} At the same
time, taking another clue from the leaders who built the back half of
the 20th century at Bretton Woods, perhaps the time has come for an
ongoing as opposed to occasional transatlantic structure [to keep pace
with the rapid changes of connected digital technologies and how to
protect both the public interest and a pervasive internet.]{.underline}

**[[introduces]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[deep-seated
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**, eight of which are considered
below. Significantly, **[digital authoritarians]{.underline}** may
**[find themselves in a state [of]{.mark} constant
[contest]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[with other]{.mark} regime
type[s]{.mark}, trapped in [cycles of overreach
and]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[backlash]{.mark}, and [prone to]{.mark}
strategic [miscalc]{.mark}ulations that pull them into interstate
conflict. The current turn to digital authoritarianism therefore also
has broader implications for international peace and
stability]{.underline}**.

Brittle Legitimacy

**[[Reliance]{.mark} on information control [makes
authoritarians]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[brittle]{.underline}**.
**[Small chinks]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in their information control
armor could [have existential consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
particularly **[during]{.underline}** political or economic
**[crises]{.underline}** (i.e. when the regime needs to rely on control
for legitimacy because it is not delivering for citizens). The
information and ideas most dangerous to authoritarians include:

> • the identity of opposition groups and leaders and their levels of
> support; 17
>
> • technical means for subverting control of communications and
> surveillance technologies;18
>
> • ideas about values that transcend state sovereignty, such as
> liberalism and human rights;19
>
> • evidence that the central government is not delivering efficient
> outcomes;20 and
>
> • ideas that undermine the myths and narratives used to legitimize
> authoritarian rule or the power of the ruling elite.21

Constant Contest

Since technologies and ideas are dynamic, the battle for information
control is a constant struggle. It can never be 'won.' **[Authoritarians
are]{.underline}** therefore **[[in]{.mark} a [perpetual]{.mark} state
of [info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare, inside and outside their
regime, and feel perpetually insecure. This dynamic may [lead]{.mark}
authoritarian governments [to]{.mark} assess that it is worth engaging
in information or [cyberattacks]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[to discredit
liberal ideas]{.underline}** **[at their foreign source or to shape or
disable systems that jeopardize their information
control---[despite]{.mark} real [risks of]{.mark} conflict
[escalation]{.mark} and global pushback.]{.underline}**

Overreach and Backlash

**[The fundamental importance]{.underline}** **[of information
control]{.underline}** to authoritarians **[increases the likelihood of
overreach]{.underline}**, **[leading to cycles of backlash
and]{.underline}** **[reprisal]{.underline}**. Many perceive China's
heavy-handed narrative warfare in Hong Kong and confrontational efforts
to control narratives about coronavirus to be strategic missteps. For
example, **[CCP efforts to stifle dissent by punishing]{.underline}**
online gaming company **[Blizzard]{.underline}** **[and
the]{.underline}** National Basketball Association
(**[NBA]{.underline}**) arguably **[aided]{.underline}** **[Hong
Kong]{.underline}** protester **[narratives]{.underline}**;22 **[while
CCP obfuscation about coronavirus has prompted unprecedented diplomatic
rebukes]{.underline}** from world leaders.23 **[Despite rising
international awareness and condemnation of China's sharp power
tactics]{.underline}**,24 **[China is accelerating, not
muting]{.underline}**, these behaviors.25 One explanation for this is
that **[the CCP calculates that the risks of international
backlash]{.underline}** (and occasional overreach by its officials)
**[are]{.underline}** **[acceptable]{.underline}**, **[compared with the
risk of letting domestic information control falter]{.underline}**.

Impaired Feedback Mechanisms

Authoritarians embrace technology to increase the legibility of their
societies. But legibility requires cooperation from society. It is
facilitated by an open information ecosystem, robust civil society,
mechanisms of transparency, and protections for political speech.26
Conversely, information control and technology-enabled systems of
surveillance and enforcement discourage accurate reporting and punish
whistleblowing, while incentivizing officials to conceal failures and
exaggerate successes.27 In 2007, Le Keqiang (before he became China's
premier) described China's national income figures as "man-made" and
unreliable, and noted that more objectively verifiable proxies should be
preferred to official statistics collected by provinces.28 Without
elections, authoritarians can also struggle to understand public
sentiment, a problem highlighted by the Chinese government's
mismanagement of massive ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Party leaders
wrongly assessed that the protestors' grievances were primarily economic
rather than political and that they did not enjoy broader public
support.29 As Zeynep Tufekci has observed, the costs of China's
"authoritarian blindness" have been immense: a solvable issue (demands
to withdraw a relatively unimportant extradition treaty) became "a
bigger, durable crisis" with ongoing political consequences.30

China's delayed reaction to coronavirus is a stark example of the
authoritarian legibility and feedback problem. Local officials and
hospital administrators in Wuhan suppressed information about the
outbreak and punished doctor whistleblowers---depriving other provinces
and the central government (not to mention international authorities) of
vital signals that would have allowed swifter action to control the
pandemic.31 Once authorities acknowledged the pandemic, China deployed
the full weight of its digital surveillance capabilities. It was able to
implement top-down lockdowns quickly; marshal its tech sector to build
health apps; force citizens to download these apps; and access vast
commercial holdings of personal data to cross-check compliance. However,
it lacked critical bottom-up feedback systems that may have obviated the
need for such draconian measures in the first place.32 Indeed,
controlling for income and population size, **[[authoritarian]{.mark}
regime[s]{.mark} [appear]{.mark} to be [more lethal]{.mark} than
democracies [during epidemics]{.mark}]{.underline}**, arguably
**[[because of]{.mark} their [closed info]{.mark}rmation
ecosystems]{.underline}**.33

Overreliance on Technological Systems which 'Fail Hard'

**[[Many]{.mark} authoritarian governments [are
embracing]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[AI]{.mark}-driven surveillance and
control]{.underline}** methods---from 'smart cities' to digital
currencies, e-payment platforms and social apps. However, **[when AI
systems fail, they]{.underline}** tend to **[fail [in
unpredictable]{.mark}]{.underline}**, often **[[catastrophic
ways]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While citizens in democracies lament slow
adoption of digital governance, **[authoritarians']{.underline}**
**[speed]{.underline}** **[comes with the risk that authorities roll out
unsafe or vulnerable systems]{.underline}**.34 **[Imagine a critical
failure of China's social credit system]{.underline}**---whether by
accident or sabotage---which affected the integrity of records. **[The
implications for regime stability could be significant]{.underline}**.

**[AI systems do not need to fail to produce problematic
results]{.underline}**. **[They draw insights and make predictions based
on correlations in vast datasets but are not good at identifying causal
mechanisms. This means that AI systems often produce outcomes which
humans cannot reverse engineer]{.underline}** or routinely evaluate.
**[Like using asbestos to build a city, AI [governance]{.mark} systems
might produce good results in the short-term]{.underline}**, **[but
inconsistencies or oversights in their approaches could [lead to
cascading failures]{.mark}]{.underline}** that humans struggle to
identify, let alone rectify.35

Unintended Consequences from High-Tech Modernism

**[Fixation by central governments on achieving targets or deploying
certain technologies creates incentives for local officials to
deploy]{.underline}** "**[technology placebos]{.underline}**" that do
little to address underlying economic and social concerns. **[For
example]{.underline}**, many so-called **[smart city
projects]{.underline}** in authoritarian societies have **[failed to
meet development and]{.underline}** **[economic goals]{.underline}**.
**[They are fraught with]{.underline}** **[issues]{.underline}** such as
"unclear strategic goals" (e.g. they often **[optimize for
surveillance]{.underline}**, **[not]{.underline}**
**[development]{.underline}**) and "inadequate implementation."36 This
problem may be **[particularly]{.underline}** pronounced
**[for]{.underline}** **[less-developed]{.underline}** **[authoritarian
governments which have been persuaded]{.underline}**, for strategic
reasons, **[to buy Chinese-exported digital surveillance tools that are
not customized to local circumstances. These cities may also become
locked]{.underline}** **[into]{.underline}** **[unstable]{.underline}**
or **[insecure technical architectures]{.underline}**37 and economic
dependence on China.38

Commitments to targets, and **[ideological fervor]{.underline}** about
technology, **[can]{.underline}** also **[distort]{.underline}**
**[commercial]{.underline}** **[decisions and raise unrealistic public
expectations]{.underline}**. Analysis of China's AI industry, for
example, suggests that companies are eschewing investment in basic
research and focusing on quick wins in applied research.39 Additionally,
China is already behind on meeting a number of its technology
targets40---a lag that will likely be exacerbated by the global economic
downturn following the coronavirus pandemic, and rising security fears
in foreign markets about the security of Chinese technology and IP theft
by its companies.

From a strategic perspective, **[there are risks]{.underline}** **[that
authoritarian governments' fixation on technology-centric strategies
will lead them to overestimate what technology can in fact
achieve]{.underline}**. For example, **[[Chinese]{.mark} military
[strategists]{.mark} have [posit]{.mark}ed that [AI could]{.mark} lift
the 'fog' of war]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** **[[eliminate
uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark}** and confusion
**[[on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[battle]{.underline}]{.mark}**field. **[[This]{.mark} is an
ahistorical and unlikely prediction that could [inspire
miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}**.41 **[Russian strategists theorize
about how psychological operations might subdue adversaries without a
shot being fired---an approach that may overestimate]{.underline}**
**[what cognitive warfare can achieve]{.underline}**, at least without
being combined with other elements of national power.42

Challenges to Social Cohesion

The medium- and long-term social consequences of digital
authoritarianism are yet untested. Overreliance on surveillance and
enforcement systems could attenuate relationships within a society,
exacerbating authoritarians' underlying low trust problems. Since they
tend to reduce citizens to data inputs, these systems may deny citizens'
intrinsic desire for dignity and identity---with unexpected results.43
Information control tactics---such as flooding---can repress opposition,
but long-term may exacerbate public uncertainty and decrease business
confidence and trust in official information, with implications for
social cohesion and economic progress.44

Dysfunctional Innovation Ecosystems

**[Information control and state-led pushes for technology dominance
risk hampering innovation]{.underline}**. For example, to achieve Xi
Jinping's 'Made in China 2025' goals, the CCP is supporting high-tech
monopolies, restricting international collaboration, and yoking the
state and market together.45 However, monopolies are notoriously
inefficient and cross-border collaboration is an important driver of
innovation. Further, innovation works best under free market conditions
and in open societies.46 Some analysts argue that China's success in
deploying AI applications is an exception to this rule. However, there
is a risk that Chinese companies are prioritizing shortterm
breakthroughs (e.g. analyzing existing datasets to find new insights) at
the expense of long-term investment in basic research.47 While
authoritarians may excel at developing and deploying AI applications,
conceptual research is arguably the real engine of AI advancement---and
something that will continue to thrive in open societies.

Summary and Further Research

All states face risks in the information age, but the extent to which
regime type affects the relative likelihood of these risks
materializing, and their magnitude, is understudied. For example, much
has been written about liberal democracies' vulnerabilities to
propaganda and foreign interference via social media.48 But **[while
[info]{.mark}rmation [war]{.mark}fare against open societies is more
likely]{.underline}**, arguably **[it [is a higher magnitude
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[for]{.underline}**
**[authoritarians]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[where control of
information]{.underline}** **[is]{.underline}** **[core to regime
survival. Similarly, analysts often lament that democratic governments
have been slow to digitize governance systems]{.underline}** and craft
forward-looking technology policy.49 **[But while digital authoritarians
might outcompete democracies in the roll-out]{.underline}** of advanced
technologies, **[this creates new vulnerabilities]{.underline}** and
risks. **[Inappropriate safeguards and accidents may result in cascading
failures, while heavily digitized governance systems may be susceptible
to foreign attack. Regime type may also affect the relative ability of
authoritarians and democracies to mitigate their information age
risks]{.underline}**. For example, **[a democracy can build resilience
to cyber and information threats through a variety of civil society and
market-based interventions. Digital authoritarians must rely on a more
limited set of top-down policy tools]{.underline}**. Ultimately, a more
systematic effort to map the comparative strengths and vulnerabilities
of authoritarians and democracies in the information age could help both
to better understand the other's threat perceptions and manage
escalation risks. It might also highlight ways in which democracies can
hold digital authoritarians' core interests at risk, in order to deter
authoritarian interference in their own digital environments.

## Solvency 

### 2NC -- CP Solvency Block

#### CP sufficiently solves the case -- coordination with the European Union revitalizes U.S.-EU cooperation across areas 

#### Solves the China advantage -- threat information sharing makes it easier and quicker to detect attacks -- that's Selga 

#### Solves the cyber advantage -- coordinating via the lens of the Joint Cyber Unit strengthens both U.S. and EU cyber posture and ability to respond to attacks 

#### It solves in place of NATO -- European unity creates cohesion around hybrid threats and attacks from Russia and China 

### Solvency -- Baltic Model

#### The U.S. and EU should adopt a Baltic-style information sharing system---will bolster resilience

RECOMMENDATIONS

**[[The diverging data governance approaches of the United States and
the EU require a flexible approach to cybersecurity]{.mark} that can
react quickly]{.underline}**, and across policy levels, **[to best
incorporate and exchange security practices, build trust, and ultimately
bolster resilience across the transatlantic space. [The Baltic approach
offers a model that can help form a dynamic cross-sectoral threat
information sharing feedback loop]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In Latvia, for
example, the Digital Transformation Guidelines establish an Information
Society Council that meets with stakeholders from the private, public,
military, and civilian sectors at the highest executive level to
directly exchange digital threat information.35 As sectors become more
dependent on data flows, the Information Society Council can dynamically
react to changes in threats. The following recommendations draw on the
Baltic experience to expand channels for the United States and the EU to
find common ground for realignment across divergent data governance and
cybersecurity regimes. These channels may be helpful in lessening
divergences in practical cyber threat aversion, and may aid in normative
alignment.

I. Establish and Advance National Cybersecurity Councils for Critical
Functions

National cybersecurity councils are common across the Baltic states.
Generally, these function as informal or formal councils that convene
representatives of military and civilian, private and public sector
participants from critical sectors, and increasingly --- critical
functions that underpin the aforementioned. These councils collect
holistic information on the state of cybersecurity across sectors, and
are the only funnel of such information. (In the United States, the
equivalent is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Critical
Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC), which has
authorities from 16 critical infrastructure sectors.)36 The **[[findings
of these cross-sectoral councils are increasingly critical to the
development of transatlantic cybersecurity]{.mark}. [A similar council
should be established at the international leve]{.mark}l, between the
United States and the EU, dedicating a channel to negotiate the security
regimes of shared transatlantic critical functions, like ensuring the
smooth operation of international finance or even maintaining internet
infrastructure]{.underline}**.

II\. Advance Threat Information Sharing Channels Under the U.S.-EU Trade
and Technology Council

President **[Biden's administration and EU leaders have both signaled
commitments to renew the transatlantic partnership, especially in the
digital arena]{.underline}**, as highlighted by the recent formation of
the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council.37 Of the 10 working groups
within the council, four are working in the ambit of cybersecurity.38
These **[working groups should be used as a platform to advance cyber
threat information sharing,]{.underline}** providing a direct forum to
channel the information from ENISA, NIST, and other national sectoral
stakeholders. **[[The aim of such a channel should be to triangulate the
highest cybersecurity priorities, which should then branch off into more
subsidiary cooperation channels with a feedback loop to higher, more
senior executive levels.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

III\. Conflate Civilian and Military Cybersecurity Experience via the
EU's Joint Cyber Unit

**[U.S.-EU cybersecurity experience sharing is segmented between
civilian and military sectors. However, the type of cyber threats both
sectors share are increasingly similar and costly. The recent proposal
to create an EU Joint Cyber Unit that will coordinate, share knowledge,
and provide advanced warnings will draw together operational groups'
national cybersecurity authorities]{.underline}** (CERTS), **[national
defense authorities]{.underline}** (military CERTs), **[and EU
structure]{.underline}**s (ENISA and the Permanent Structured
Cooperation; PESCO), among others.39 **[This Joint Cyber Unit can act as
the mirror partner to the United States, which already has military and
civilian sectors]{.underline}** sharing risks via the Cyber **[Unified
Coordination Group. The partnership between the United States and the EU
in this capacity can take place via the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology
Council]{.underline}**, or a separate channel.

### Solvency -- Cyber/Hybrid Threats

#### Strong European security policies and cooperation strengthen U.S. security 

**[Borrell 19]{.underline}** (Josep Borrell, High Representative of the
Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, 1/12/2019, A stronger
European Union within a better, greener and safer world - key principles

There can be no doubt that [the US plays an essential role in the
maintenance of peace and security, and also in European security.
Indeed, in many places on our continent and at our borders, we need to
work together to get sustainable results, from the Western Balkans, to
the Eastern Mediterranean to Ukraine and beyond]{.underline}. As global
partners, [we will have to deepen our dialogue and cooperation in all
areas,]{.underline} including on reviving the Iran nuclear deal and the
broader area of non-proliferation and arms control. In addition, we will
soon begin a dialogue to discuss the full range of issues related to
China. We will also look at opportunities for cooperation across the
globe where our interests coincide.

Many US administrations have insisted that Europe increases its defence
efforts to take better care of its own security and act as a security
provider. So it matters that we are already actively working to
strengthen EU defence policies, capacities and operations. Our flagship
defence initiatives now include the Permanent Structured Cooperation
(PESCO), the European Defence Fund (EDF) and military mobility.
**[Indeed, a strong and capable Europe is not a rival to the
trans-Atlantic alliance but a precondition for it.]{.underline}**

**[Reinforcing defence capabilities of EU member states strengthen the
Alliance and contribute to transatlantic burden-sharing]{.underline}**.
**[A more assertive, more capable and resilient Europe is the best
partner for the US. Enhancing Europe's security role will allow for a
better cooperation with the US when it comes to the security risks of
today and those of the future]{.underline}**. It is clear that **[we
have much to gain from close cooperation with the US to address pressing
security challenges, from cyber security to hybrid threats, protecting
our critical infrastructure and the security implications of climate
change]{.underline}**. We should certainly be ambitious in this area.

While we step up cooperation, [we should be mindful that the experience
of the last four year have left their toll on European public
opinion]{.underline}. Indeed a clear majority of Europeans, as explained
in a recent ECFR report, now believe that even under President Biden,
the US will be mostly consumed with healing internal divisions and will
have little capacity or will to help solve global problems. And there
are underlying reasons---demographic, economic, and political---why the
historical trajectory of the United States and Europe could well
diverge. [However, we appreciate that at least for the next four years
there will be a US President who believes in partnership with democratic
allies. And we don't just feel appreciation for this restoration, but we
recognize its necessity.]{.underline}

**[[Formalize transatlantic operational coordination to counter

**[[Countering the spread of mass disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(including deep fakes, cheapfakes and other next-generation
disinformation technology), [**[particularly from China and Russia, must
be at the core of the joint transatlantic project to defend the
integrity of democracies. Europe and the United States were equally the
target]{.underline}** o]{.mark}f strategically launched disinformation
campaigns by Russia and China at the height of the spring COVID
outbreak.

As part of the Tech Forum's work, the U.S. State Department's Global
Engagement Center and the EEAS detection and early-warning systems must
be closely aligned. The 2018 G-7 summit Charlevoix agreed to build
transatlantic data competence to identify dual-use tech and tech-powered
human rights violations so that powerful nations can coordinate
sanctions design. Transatlantic nations need to expedite the
implementation of this decision.

**[[Both sides have a vested interest in protecting election
infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}** from technological interference by
malign actors**[. This includes a tighter control on election
advertising, bots, deep fakes, inauthentic behavior, and hate
speec]{.underline}**h. But there must also be a recognition that these
efforts cannot be used to give governments greater power to restrict
real political speech--- including unpopular opinions.

The December 2020 European Democracy Action Plan (EDAP) signals the EU
could be willing to make a joint effort with U.S. agencies and lawmakers
to focus on the twin challenges of increasing transparency and
accountability of platforms. A joint EU--U.S. 'code of conduct' on
removal of hate speech, illegal and illiberal and blatantly harmful
content could create a 'race to the top' when coupled with a credible
threat of regulatory action---all while safeguarding provisions of
transparency and free speech. A transatlantic audit mechanism of 'black
box' algorithms could also force changes in business models. Joint
EU--U.S. standards around identifying and marking disinformation could
give platforms greater credibility and accountability.

**[The [Tech Forum could]{.mark} also [work to correct the information
asymmetry on technology that exists among EU, member state and American
lawmakers devising platform regulation. And it could coordinate joint
research funding by American and European foundations and academic
institutions into the impact of disinformation on society and democratic
integrity to better anticipate, educate and counter its
spread]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Permutation Block

#### Links to the net benefit -- any inclusion of NATO forces redirection of its priorities and reallocation of its resources -- that's Moller 

#### The permutation causes operational redundancy -- decks any increased cybersecurity measures

**[Atlamazoglou and Moyer 22]{.underline}** (Constantine Atlamazoglou,

Global Europe Program, 6/1/22, A Strategic Compass: The European Union

https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/strategic-compass-european-union-expands-its-toolbox)

Nevertheless, [[the EU needs to ensure that its mechanisms]{.mark}
contribute effectively [to transatlantic unity.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Perhaps the most striking stipulation of the Strategic Compass is the
creation of a 5,000-strong force able to swiftly deploy to
non-permissive environments]{.underline}. The force is to include air,
land, and maritime components along with strategic enablers. It will be
enabled through the substantial modification of the EU Battlegroups and
the member-states that will participate with troops and capabilities
will be pre-identified.

[However, [NATO currently has the NATO Response Force (NRF) which can
start deploying globally]{.mark}]{.underline} within one to four weeks
and a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can start
deploying within two days. EU member-states that are also part of NATO
are major contributors to the NRF and VJTF[. Therefore, [there is risk
of **operational redundancy between the EU and NATO**'s
components.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Additionally, [[due to the high number of initiatives put forth]{.mark}
by the Strategic Compass [the risk of some of them falling behind
schedule or underdelivering is present]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Nevertheless, besides the obstacles ahead, the importance of the
document for the geopolitical future of the EU should not be
underestimated.

#### No solvency \-- the EU Treaty has broader scopes of protection and collective cyber-defense -- NATO acting would trade off.

**[[The EU Treaty acknowledges that the Alliance is the main forum for
the collective defence]{.mark} of its members as defined in Article 5 of
the NATO Treaty. However, there has been considerable debate on how this
affects the EU, considering that [the EU has its own mutual defence
clause: Article 42.7]{.mark} TEU]{.underline}** (see chapter 3). Despite
the degree of ambiguity surrounding Article 42.7, **[EU member states
agree that the Alliance should remain the principal organisation for
safeguarding collective defence]{.underline}**.89 **[Not only is there a
widely held view that the EU lacks the necessary means and capabilities
to autonomously defend its territory, but a majority also believe that
deterrence and collective defence are only credible because of the
pivotal role of the US]{.underline}**.90 87 The concrete proposals can
be found here: proposals dating from December 2016 & proposals dating
from December 2017.

**[However, Article 42.7 TEU [has already been invoked]{.mark} in
response to a terrorist attack in the past [and could also be called
upon in the nearby future]{.mark}, for example when an EU member state
is under attack, [which is in particular relevant for the cyber
domain]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} This **[[applies specifically to
non-NATO EU member states]{.mark} such as Finland and Sweden. Even
though these countries work closely with NATO, [Article 5 would not
apply if they were to be attacked]{.mark}. T]{.underline}**hus, it is
important to clarify what the EU's responsibilities could be. As stated
in chapter 3, **[[when cyberattacks hit non-military infrastructure and
other targets, it seems preferable that the EU acts instead of NATO in
case international assistance is needed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other
words, **[what is already the case for activating Article
42]{.underline}**.7 TEU when an EU member state is under a terrorist
attack should equally apply to cyberattacks targeted at the civilian
infrastructure. In order to clarify what sort of cyberattacks would fall
under the Article 42.7 TEU or under NATO's Article 5 clause, both
organisations should discus scenario-planning and attend each other's
relevant exercises. Furthermore, the case of an armed attack against an
EU member state can raise questions for which the answer is not to refer
to NATO's collective defence task because the EU member state under an
armed attack is not a NATO Ally or the Alliance is not capable of
responding collectively. What will happen if an EU member state invokes
Article 42.7 in such cases? In sum, while the **[principle holds that
NATO is the primary organisation responsible for collective defence, as
part of the Strategic Compass process the EU should not overlook the
importance of operationalising and clarifying the applicability of
Article 42.7 TEU.]{.underline}**

[Representatives from the European Union (EU) and US government have

the development of trustworthy AI and privacy-enhancing
technologie]{.underline}s. The outcomes were announced after a second
ministerial meeting of the US-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) in
Paris on May 15-16. Many of the announcements were given extra urgency
by current Russian aggression in Ukraine. On that note, there's a new
Cooperation Framework on issues related to information integrity in
crises, particularly concerning the Kremlin's attempt to "manipulate and
censor" information. There will also be closer information exchange
between the two parties on critical tech exports, with an initial focus
on Russia and other sanctions-evading countries. On a more positive
note, [the TTC agreed to produce a cybersecurity best practice guide for
SMBs, which it said were "disproportionately" impacted by cyber-threats.
There were also commitments to "promote secure, resilient, diverse,

technologies, [the EU and US agreed to develop a joint roadmap to

EU-US

Besides cooperation within a variety of European formats, one could
think of increasing cooperation between the EU and the US. At the latest
EU-US Summit on 15 June 2021, the topic of security and defence was
explicitly added to the agenda. Therefore, this offers a second
possibility for transatlantic cooperation outside the EU-NATO framework
in the field of countering hybrid threats. **[By cooperating with the US
directly,]{.underline}** [some of the political obstacles in the NATO
context may be circumvented (especially political tensions around
Turkey, Greece and Cyprus).]{.underline} Therefore, [it could be
worthwhile to start some more relatively small test projects in this
specific cooperation framework.]{.underline}

[More concretely, one could think of the development of a 'strong
collaborative relationship' between the EU and the US in the digital and
information domain. This would contribute to **countering hybrid
threats** stemming from China and Russia]{.underline}. [If this
partnership is explicitly embedded in policies on both sides of the
Atlantic, this will help to form a unified stance towards
adversaries]{.underline} such as China and Russia.﻿\[101\] Despite the
potential advantages that this may bring, one should also take into
consideration the downsides that this format might bring about. Existing
initiatives for direct EU-US (military) cooperation show that political
and bureaucratic obstacles may still exist. A good example is the recent
EU-US cooperation on military mobility, which is being hindered by
bureaucratic red tape after the initial decision was taken to allow the
three non-EU states to join the related PRSCO project.﻿\[102\] Moreover,
[care should be taken not to alienate the few NATO countries that are
not EU members and might feel left out by increasing EU-US (military)
cooperation.]{.underline}

#### The U.S. needs to be on board with EU security policies -- NATO has too much on its plate

**[López-Aranda 22]{.underline}** (Ambassador Ricardo López-Aranda,

https://www.gmfus.org/news/renewed-sense-purpose-europe-and-transatlantic-relationship-75th-anniversary-marshall-plan)

**[Another traditionally vexing issue is the respective role of NATO and
the EU in European security]{.underline}**. [The EU can and, as the new
Strategic Compass reflects, is willing to do more in crisis management
and the development of military capabilities, thus helping to lighten
the US security burden in Europe and the neighboring area.]{.underline}
**[But if the US signals reluctance to this, as has been the case in the
past, this will generate resistance in some EU member
states]{.underline}**. [More burden sharing requires the United States
to be supportive of European efforts in developing its security
dimension.]{.underline} As High Representative Borrell has stated, **[to
increase the military capabilities of the European Union is a way of
increasing and reinforcing the global security, the transatlantic link
in complementarity with NATO.]{.underline}**

That said, there is no denying that the Trump administration has left a
sense of concern in Europe about the solidity of the US commitment to
European security. The development of strategic autonomy within the EU
is a reflection of this concern. But the [Ukraine crisis has shown how
efficiently the transatlantic relation can work when addressing together
a common challenge. On both sides of the Atlantic, this common purpose
means a renewal of mutual trust and hence of the solidity of the
alliance.]{.underline}

[Ultimately, the Russian aggression against Ukraine also profoundly
affects the debate on NATO's role, as it brings to the fore its
traditional character as an instrument of collective security in the
European area. Europe and the United States will no doubt continue
working together in facing international challenges, including the
consequences for the international order of China's growing
assertiveness.]{.underline} But **[arguably NATO will have to
concentrate on its core task of dealing with the challenges coming from
Europe's eastern and southern neighborhoods.]{.underline}**

The Madrid NATO summit, which will take place June 29-30, will be an
historic moment. The Madrid Strategic Concept will have to outline an
agenda to make our military better prepared for the challenges coming
from the East and from the South, as well as establish processes to make
our societies to be more resilient against cyberattacks and
disinformation. For Spain, it will be an occasion to celebrate the 40th
anniversary of its accession to NATO, a reminder that freedom and
democracy that cannot be taken for granted.

# Permutation

### DA: Article V

#### The EU Treaty has broader scopes of protection and collective cyber-defense -- NATO acting would trade off.

https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep32154.9)

**[The EU Treaty acknowledges that the Alliance is the main forum for
the collective defence of its members as defined in Article 5 of the
NATO Treaty. However, there has been considerable debate on how this
affects the EU, considering that the EU has its own mutual defence
clause: Article 42.7 TEU]{.underline}** (see chapter 3). Despite the
degree of ambiguity surrounding Article 42.7, **[EU member states agree
that the Alliance should remain the principal organisation for
safeguarding collective defence]{.underline}**.89 **[Not only is there a
widely held view that the EU lacks the necessary means and capabilities
to autonomously defend its territory, but a majority also believe that
deterrence and collective defence are only credible because of the
pivotal role of the US]{.underline}**.90 87 The concrete proposals can
be found here: proposals dating from December 2016 & proposals dating
from December 2017.

**[However, Article 42.7 TEU has already been invoked in response to a
terrorist attack in the past and could also be called upon in the nearby
future, for example when an EU member state is under attack, which is in
particular relevant for the cyber domain]{.underline}**. This **[applies
specifically to non-NATO EU member states such as Finland and Sweden.
Even though these countries work closely with NATO, Article 5 would not
apply if they were to be attacked. T]{.underline}**hus, it is important
to clarify what the EU's responsibilities could be. As stated in chapter
3, **[when cyberattacks hit non-military infrastructure and other
targets, it seems preferable that the EU acts instead of NATO in case
international assistance is needed]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[what is already the case for activating Article 42]{.underline}**.7
TEU when an EU member state is under a terrorist attack should equally
apply to cyberattacks targeted at the civilian infrastructure. In order
to clarify what sort of cyberattacks would fall under the Article 42.7
TEU or under NATO's Article 5 clause, both organisations should discus
scenario-planning and attend each other's relevant exercises.
Furthermore, the case of an armed attack against an EU member state can
raise questions for which the answer is not to refer to NATO's
collective defence task because the EU member state under an armed
attack is not a NATO Ally or the Alliance is not capable of responding
collectively. What will happen if an EU member state invokes Article
42.7 in such cases? In sum, while the **[principle holds that NATO is
the primary organisation responsible for collective defence, as part of
the Strategic Compass process the EU should not overlook the importance
of operationalising and clarifying the applicability of Article 42.7
TEU.]{.underline}**

### DA: European Security

#### Reliance on NATO precludes development of united European collective defense measures

Military Force?," *RSIS Commentary,*

accessed 8-6-2020)

In an interview with The Economist on 21 October 2019, French President
Emmanuel **[Macron painted a distinctively bleak picture of the state of
security affairs in Europe]{.underline}**. Candidly, **[he urged for a
rethinking]{.underline}** **[of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
(NATO)]{.underline}** **[and its traditional role as a long-standing
cornerstone of Europe's defence, going so far as to assert that Europe
is experiencing the "brain death of NATO".]{.underline}** **[He warned
that if Europe continues to meander along, choosing to ignore the
reality of an increasingly unreliable American partner in fulfilling
NATO's commitment to the freedom and security of its members, it would
cease to be in control of its own destiny.]{.underline}** Underpinning
this "apocalyptic vision" is a familiar rhetoric he has used before.
**[Europe needs to have a military force of its own and start thinking
of itself as a strategic power.]{.underline}** Is he right? **[An
independent European Union (EU) military force that would protect
Europeans is familiar rhetoric and the idea that EU might eventually
deviate from NATO has been discussed long before Macron's
appearance.]{.underline}** For the first time, the EU signalled in its
2016 EU Global Strategy a qualitative shift in its strategic outlook; it
put forth the idea of attaining "a certain level of strategic autonomy"
and being able to "act independently if and when it is needed". **[This
rhetoric picked up steam when German Chancellor Angela Merkel endorsed
Macron's call for the creation of a EU army in November 2018,
reiterating the stand that Europe needs to be able to defend
itself.]{.underline}** At the same time, EU President Donald Tusk
alluded to a new era in which American and European relations are at an
inflection point due to differences in worldviews and actions. **[Tusk
echoed the rhetoric of having a European army in the face of an American
administration (under President Donald Trump) that seems intent on
breaking down the post-World War II order.]{.underline}** Increased
calls for the creation of an independent EU military force have been
recurring and the potential onset of an uncertain multi-polar world has
pushed this familiar rhetoric further. This is not to say that there
have been no attempts at enhancing EU's military capabilities and
defence structure. **[The EU has taken steps to bolster its military
capabilities]{.underline}** through the establishment of the Permanent
Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and battle groups. Such initiatives
provide platforms for EU member states to work together in planning,
investing and developing projects that heighten the functional
integration of the military forces. **[However, the voluntary nature of
such projects means that the member states can remain elusive about
defence collaboration.]{.underline}** Moreover, by leaving participation
in PESCO to the willingness of member states, **[there is little
alignment and agreement on how member states are going to contribute to
these projects]{.underline}**. Similarly, **[the creation of the battle
groups in 2004]{.underline}**, with an aim to compensate for EU's lack
in permanent military forces, **[was promising]{.underline}** in its
inception**[, but has not been deployed]{.underline}** since it became
operational in 2007. **[The lack of political resolve by the EU in these
attempts at strengthening the EU's military capabilities provides a
glimpse of the challenges Macron will face if he tries to push for the
development of a permanent, independent and unified EU military
force.]{.underline}** **[Underlying these half-hearted attempts at
enhancing the military capabilities of EU is the member states' reliance
on NATO]{.underline}**. The 2002 NATO-EU Declaration on a European
Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and the subsequent 2003 "Berlin Plus"
essentially cemented EU reliance on NATO. This dependence can be seen
from the current presence of 4,500 US troops stationed in Poland and the
added confirmation that more troops will be sent to the region.
Departure from NATO would mean being cut off from access to NATO's
military planning capabilities and resources − essential support that
the EU has grown accustomed to and would need much time to build up on
its own. Will Macron's assertive choice of words take root this time?
Europe finds itself facing an increasingly uncertain geopolitical
climate. Recent developments such as America's troop withdrawal from
Syria, which effectively led to a hasty invasion into Kurdish territory
in north-eastern Syria by Turkey (another NATO-member), undoubtedly
contributed to Macron's bold criticism of NATO. Earlier episodes of
Russian aggression in Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova likewise spurred the
Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger to affirm
that "the creation of a European army is inevitable". **[However, such
push for an independent European collective defence demands a level of
unity and commitment that the EU currently does not seem capable
of]{.underline}**. As a whole, the EU is still embroiled in tackling
Brexit while contending with the rise of populism and the ongoing
migration crisis. **[The chances that EU member states would
rally]{.underline}** around brash rhetoric **[and pull]{.underline}**
attention **[away]{.underline}** **[from]{.underline}** their respective
**[domestic issues are slim.]{.underline}** As such, Macron's warning
words may end up being symbolic rhetoric at best, noted for its
audacity, but soon to be relinquished to the back of people's mind until
such "familiar rhetoric" starts up again.

### DA: Redundancy

#### The permutation causes operational redundancy -- decks any increased cybersecurity measures

**[Atlamazoglou and Moyer 22]{.underline}** (Constantine Atlamazoglou,
European Security Analyst/Journalist; Jason C. Moyer, Program Associate,
Global Europe Program, 6/1/22, A Strategic Compass: The European Union
expands its toolbox, Wilson Center,
https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/strategic-compass-european-union-expands-its-toolbox)

Nevertheless, [the EU needs to ensure that its mechanisms contribute
effectively to transatlantic unity.]{.underline}

[Perhaps the most striking stipulation of the Strategic Compass is the
creation of a 5,000-strong force able to swiftly deploy to
non-permissive environments]{.underline}. The force is to include air,
land, and maritime components along with strategic enablers. It will be
enabled through the substantial modification of the EU Battlegroups and
the member-states that will participate with troops and capabilities
will be pre-identified.

[However, NATO currently has the NATO Response Force (NRF) which can
start deploying globally]{.underline} within one to four weeks and a
Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) that can start deploying
within two days. EU member-states that are also part of NATO are major
contributors to the NRF and VJTF[. Therefore, there is risk of
**operational redundancy between the EU and NATO**'s
components.]{.underline}

Additionally, [due to the high number of initiatives put forth by the
Strategic Compass the risk of some of them falling behind schedule or
underdelivering is present]{.underline}. Nevertheless, besides the
obstacles ahead, the importance of the document for the geopolitical
future of the EU should not be underestimated.

### A2 Perm: NATO-EU Disputes

#### NATO-EU cooperation is formally blocked by Turkey -- cooperation that does happen is [stalled]{.underline} by this dispute

**[Smith 19]{.underline}** (Simon J. Smith, Associate Professor of
Security and International Relations at Staffordshire University,

Quartz,
https://qz.com/1759575/a-short-history-of-the-eu-and-natos-uneasy-relationship/)

The American NATO expert David Yost set out the problems at the heart of
the EU-NATO relationship in a 2007 book. As he put it: "[Difficulties
include institutional and national rivalries, the participation problem,
and disagreements about the proper scope and purpose of NATO-EU
cooperation."]{.underline}

[The "participation problem" is a central impediment to formal EU-NATO
relations that stems from the ongoing dispute between Turkey (a
NATO-only member) and Cyprus (an EU-only member).]{.underline} This
**[led to Turkey directly blocking formal EU-NATO cooperation in
2004]{.underline}** beyond that of Operation ALTHEA. Formal meetings
between the PSC and NAC were suspended as [Turkey objected, and still
does, to Cyprus sitting in on such meetings without a NATO security
agreement---which Turkey refuses to allow.]{.underline}

[Informal meetings do take place but these have been described to me by
both PSC and NAC ambassadors during my research as "dull," "highly
scripted," and "uninspiring".]{.underline} As a result, there has been a
move towards enhancing cooperation at the inter-organizational level to
compensate for deficiencies at the formal political level.

[[The eyes of the West are on NATO]{.mark} and its swift response to
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.]{.underline} [[But]{.mark} we should also
focus our thinking on the European Union]{.underline}, **[for [only the
EU and not the US-led military alliance can be the basis of a peaceful
long-term outcome to this crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

So far, [the EU's political input has centred on sanctions to dissuade
Russia from continuing its war against Ukraine. Henceforth, though, it
must play a wider role.]{.underline} That was the message France's
President Emmanuel Macron strove to impart when he proposed a wider
European political framework open to non-EU members such as Ukraine and
the United Kingdom.

[NATO's importance is indisputable.]{.underline} Although its
ill-considered enlargement may very well have contributed to the crisis
by feeding Russia's 'encirclement' paranoia, the alliance now stands as
the only credible deterrent of further incursions. **[However, [US
military strength can never be key to a lasting peace settlement in
Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

The US must back an eventual ceasefire leading to peace discussions
between Kyiv and Moscow. But [[the greater burden of establishing a new
European order capable of reassuring Russians while punishing Putin will
fall on the EU's shoulders]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Washington's financial
and material support is crucial to Ukraine's gallant counter-attacks,
but it also rules out US leadership in whatever post-war reconciliation
and re-balancing process may emerge.]{.underline}

[The US not only leads [NATO]{.mark} but dominates it, so the alliance's
future is [potentially clouded by America's domestic
politics]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} When Moscow launched its
blitzkrieg attack on Kyiv, worldwide condemnation was tinged with relief
that Donald Trump is no longer in the White House. Now his strengthening
grip on the Republican Party is ringing alarm bells warning of a
possible return. [Much of the damage he did to the transatlantic
alliance has been repaired, yet that [doesn't quell fears of how NATO
would fare in a second Trump presidency.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The crux of the problem is the military inadequacy of]{.mark} all [the
EU]{.mark}'s member states]{.underline}. The eastern deployment of
European troops has been getting much play in media reporting of the
Ukraine crisis, but the reality is far less reassuring. The [[legacy of
three decades of free-riding and reliance on the US]{.mark} is Europe's
lack of firepower, limited cooperation between national armed forces and
the proliferation of incompatible weapons systems.]{.underline}

The EU has for years been trying to boost member governments' defence
spending, but with little success. The European national average is 1.6
per cent of GDP, far short of the 2 per cent targets of both NATO and
the Union. Most governments still ignore the requirements of PESCO, the
EU's permanent structured cooperation pact of 2018.

When in 2020 Brussels published a long-awaited Defence Review, it
observed that only 60 per cent of the troops notionally available for
Europe's protection can be activated operationally. This year, that
concern has become a fact; less than a third of the forces hurriedly
deployed to strengthen NATO's eastern frontiers are European. American
units flown in from the US make up the majority.

Despite these manifest weaknesses, Charles Michel, President of the
European Council which groups EU leaders, declared last December that
2022 was to be "the year of European defence." Security policy veterans
recalled the embarrassment of 1999 when Luxembourg's foreign minister
Jacques Poos boasted that attempts to avert war in the Balkans were "the
hour of Europe, not America."

The recent flurry of national boosts to defence spending is encouraging,
but it's no more than the first step down a long road. Germany's €100
billion plan to reinvigorate its armed forces, for instance, will
probably take about 15 years to bear fruit. Recruitment and rearmament
are not the only priorities, because the EU's most daunting challenge is
to parallel NATO's 'command and control' structures.

[[The EU has been trying for almost 20 years to develop its own defence
identity]{.mark}, but in the area of security it [still lacks the
Atlantic alliance's diplomatic and operational mechanisms.]{.mark}
Without them, Europe will remain unable to project force to any
substantial degree.]{.underline}

[Thanks to Putin's war, the [EU must brace to take on the leadership of
a far-reaching post-war project to reorder and rebuild relationships
across Europe]{.mark}. Once Washington's focus returns to East Asia,
Brussels must have developed a much fiercer bite to reinforce its
bark.]{.underline}

#### EU strategic autonomy benefits NATO and frees up US resources

Beyond the need for added capability, at a strategic level**[, it is
also critical to understand [what kind of actor Europe sees itself as
i]{.mark}n this new geopolitical era.]{.underline}** Conversations
around strategic autonomy have often been fraught for this very reason.
At times, certain expressions or interpretations of the concept have
created fears in the United States of geopolitical hedging or strategic
ambivalence. But rather than lamenting a worst-case scenario, **[it [is
more useful for both sides of the Atlantic to jointly seize the current
momen]{.mark}t in a constructive way. [Traditional US fears should be
put aside and replaced with a proactive agenda]{.mark} that encourages a
clearer European pillar in the alliance, that, for European purposes,
could also be used more ad hoc in non-NATO contingencies]{.underline}**.
**[This should be done [through new planning and thinking around
burden-sharing metrics,]{.mark} including a more holistic reevaluation,
reinvestment, and planning of Europe-wide contributions to the
alliance]{.underline}**. Ultimately, **[[such efforts should fill gaps
in European crisis-management capabilities and contribute to European
defense within the NATO contex]{.mark}t]{.underline}**. Such an approach
"could also lead to a new division of labor within the alliance. That
need not divide the alliance. **[It would just create greater clarity as
to who would lead certain missions and what they need to do to
succeed]{.underline}**."

The EU Council concluded in November 2016 that strategic autonomy is the
"capacity to act autonomously when and where necessary and with partners
wherever possible." In this sense, **[[an EU-based strategic
autonomy]{.mark}, as argued above, that [aligns and coordinates with
NATO's defense planning]{.mark} and could operate formally within or
informally below the consensus NATO or EU level [would certainly be
welcomed, particularly at a time when the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[will likely be increasingly preoccupied elsewhere]{.mark}. Europe's
[ability to respond robustly in resolving regional crises, while
complementing]{.mark}---and, if possible, supplanting---certain
[collective defense efforts traditionally borne by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would be a hugely welcome development]{.mark} for US
policymakers and put NATO on a more sustainable footing.]{.underline}**

Professor of Law and International Organization at the Columbia Law

World, pp. 24 )

Finally, **[being able to set norms globally]{.underline}** allows the
EU to prove to its critics that it remains relevant as a global economic
power. Embracing the role of a regulatory hegemon reinforces the EU's
identity and **[enhances the EU's global standing]{.underline}** even in
the times of crises where its effectiveness and relevance are constantly
being questioned. If the EU wants to exert influence, it must do so with
the means available to it. **[Lacking traditional means of power, the
EU's greatest global influence is accomplished through the norms that it
has the competence to promulgate]{.underline}**. In the absence of
military power or unconstrained economic power, **[the EU can exercise
genuine unilateral power most effectively by fixing the standards of
behavior for the rest of the world]{.underline}**.80 In the world where
the United States projects hard power through its military and
engagement engagement in trade wars, and China economic power through
its loans and investments, the EU exerts power through the most potent
tool for global influence it has---regulation.

**[Because of the pressure of an aggressive multipolar system, whereby
China's influence is on the rise and the US increasingly focuses on the
Pacific, NATO is bound to demand a higher level of burdensharing from

Alliance needs to be able to potentially fight a conflict in which
American and European forces are to a certain degree interchangeable,
and Europeans are able to hold NATO's eastern flank with limited
American support while a simultaneous crisis is attractingmost US forces
in the Pacific. At the same time, by reaching an appropriate degree of
strategic autonomy in the midterm, the EU will be able to operate with
NATO on the high level of the conflict spectrum and contribute to
Europe's defense and deterrence. Still, European strategic autonomy
should also cover non-military issues such as emerging technologies,
just like the EU-NATO collaboration should concern the whole security
spectrum.

In December 2019, the Trump presidency made some headway in this respect
by gaining NATO's acceptance to develop a China policy, but the
**[[transatlantic dialogue remains anchored in a debate over the role of
technology and societal resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}**.24 The EU---
which, in March 2019, labeled China a "systemic rival"---was unsure of
the leadership the United States was offering and whether the Trump
administration would endorse the move or continue to treat the Brussels
organization antagonistically.25 The EU is offering a reset to the
United States and a new beginning to the Western response to China.
**[The [Biden]{.mark} presidency could [exploit this to craft a new

their implications for societal and military resilience]{.underline}**,
it is vital that Washington and Brussels come to an agreement.
