## Uniqueness

### GOP Wins

#### GOP will win now -- unless their strategy gets screwed up

**Brooks, The Hill, 7-12-22** 

\[Emily Brooks, 7-12-2022, The Hill, \"GOP sees chances of midterm rout
spike\",
https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3553938-gop-says-cake-is-pretty-well-baked-for-house-takeover-as-they-eye-senate-states/,
accessed on 7-15-2022, MG\]

[Poll after poll showing voter discontent with President Biden and the
economy is cementing Republicans' sense that a GOP House majority is all
but inevitable, while boosting their hopes about taking control of the
Senate and flipping some gubernatorial and state-level
seats.]{.underline}

["The cake is pretty well baked at this point in favor of the
Republicans taking control of the House," said GOP consultant John
Thomas. "The Republicans would have to willfully work to screw it up.
Doesn't mean it's impossible."]{.underline} A New York Times survey
highlighted on the paper's front page on Monday punctuated the grim
environment for Democrats. Just a quarter of Democratic voters said
Biden should be the presidential nominee in 2024, and the sentiment that
the U.S. is headed in the wrong direction has hit 77 percent, the
highest since the height of the 2008 financial crash.

[The survey is in line with numerous other recent ones finding Biden's
underwater approval rating.]{.underline}

[In an environment like this, and barring any earth-shattering changes,
analysts say, the biggest liability for swing-seat Republicans are
themselves. And while there is near-universal optimism that Republicans
will win the House, the Senate and governorships are less
certain."]{.underline}

[Absent a miracle, there is no chance \[Democrats\] hold the House in
November, and their only hope in the Senate will be Republicans choosing
terrible candidates, which they have proven very capable of doing," said
Rory Cooper, a veteran GOP strategist.]{.underline}

[Republicans need to net only one seat to win control of the Senate, but
the electoral landscape there is trickier and more based on individual
candidates and races than in the House.]{.underline}

"I think those candidates have some work to do. If they can get it
within striking distance, the wave should put them over," Thomas said.

Sarah Longwell, an anti-Trump GOP strategist, pointed to candidates such
as Hershel Walker, the Trump-backed GOP Senate nominee in Georgia who
was recently revealed to be the father of three previously unknown
children, being liabilities for Republican hopes of winning key races.

[Though it is a "broadly very favorable environment for Republicans,"
Longwell said, she could see a scenario where "Republicans do really
well, they take the House, but they lose a lot of these individual
Senate races because they've nominated cranks and
extremists."]{.underline}

GOP operatives, however, point to Democrats signaling a poor strategy on
their part in key races.

Democratic political groups spent around \$5.5 million trying to amplify
the most conservative candidates in the Colorado GOP Senate primary, but
failed in keeping construction company owner Joe O'Dea from becoming the
nominee to challenge incumbent Sen. Michael Bennett (D). O'Dea's win
prompted Roll Call election analyst Nathan Gonzales to move the race
from "solid Democratic" to "likely Democratic."

[And Republicans say that many issues that Democrats are focusing on ---
such as abortion, revelations about former President Trump from the
House Jan. 6 select committee and "Ultra MAGA" extremists --- are not
sticking.]{.underline}

[A poll of likely voters in swing states commissioned by the Republican
State Leadership Committee, which supports down-ballot state-level
candidates, and conducted in the days after the Supreme Court overturned
Roe v. Wade found that more voters named inflation, the economy and
crime as top issues than pointed to abortion.]{.underline}

["While abortion is an issue people care about, the data makes clear
that it is not among the top issues that will drive voting behavior in
November. Instead, this election will remain about Biden's failing
economy," a memo accompanying the poll said.]{.underline}

[In the New York Times survey released Monday, just 5 percent of voters
named abortion as their most important issue.]{.underline}

["The January 6 committee has not moved the needle against the
Republicans in the midterm cycle really in the slightest," Thomas said.
"Like, it's not even in the top five issues of concern of
voters."]{.underline}

Republicans point to the GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin's off-year 2021
gubernatorial win in Virginia, where education and the economy were top
issues for voters, as a key indication of where 2022 races are headed.
In that race, Democratic nominee and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe
unsuccessfully tried to tie Youngkin to Trump.

The Republican Governors Association last year named eight
Democratic-controlled states where Biden performed similarly or worse in
2020 than he did in Virginia, seeing them as within reach.

["In races up and down the ballot, Democrats are throwing every issue
they can think of at the wall in the hopes of distracting voters from
the overwhelming stress Biden's inflation is having on their monthly
budget, but it's just not working,"]{.underline} said Joanna Rodriguez,
a spokesperson for the Republican Governors Association. "Republican
governors and candidates are addressing them directly by telling voters
about the policies that led to stronger recoveries in Republican-led
states compared to their Democrat-led counterparts, and sharing their
ideas for helping folks get the relief they need."

### Dems Split Now

**Ideological split in the Democratic party decks moderates- it's
anyone's game**

**Schnell, The Hill Congressional Reporter & Trudo, The Hill Senior
Political Correspondent, 7-11-22**

(Mychael and Hanna, 7-11-22, The Hill, \"Doomsday political scenario
takes shape for Democrats\",
https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3553898-doomsday-political-scenario-takes-shape-for-democrats/?email=520ea953dc178f0b806be04939d36a974d09935e&emaila=b07d336abbbb12d6c745f3d915731b7e&emailb=abfc8154c4b60ce3c8f2113e96b5e3181dd3cb5a7eafa002087e7168a75536c2&utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=New%20Campaign&utm_term=News%20Alerts
accessed on 7-12-22 hooch//cs)

**[Beyond the bleak bird's eye view, there are some granular differences
that are adding to frustration within the party and confusion among
voters. The persistent debate about party direction, particularly felt
in the battle for the House, is not over, some progressives and
moderates say.]{.underline}**

**[While certain ideological debates have been put on the back burner to
focus more acutely on Biden, there are regular disagreements about the
types of candidates who can win elections and who deserves to keep their
seats.]{.underline}**

**[Liberals think newer and more progressive candidates should be
ushered in during the general election]{.underline}** and have worked to
defeat some Democrats they believe represent the old guard. A recent
example came in Oregon, when insurgent Jamie McLeod-Skinner, an
attorney, ousted Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.), a rare Biden endorsee, to
face off against a Republican in the coming months.

**["We think our progressive candidates are best positioned to survive
the crosswinds," said Farrell. "They are the most forceful in advocating
for what Democratic voters actually want -- bold
leadership."]{.underline}**

**[But even that has sparked resentment, adding to the perception that
the party lacks unity and direction on top of all their other
problems.]{.underline}**

**[And while some moderates typically like to jab progressives whom they
believe can't win general elections, others are now even cautious about
bringing Biden into the conversation as a leader worth emulating. That
hesitation has further blurred the lines of the ideal prototype of a
Democrat who can win.]{.underline}**

**[To that end, some prominent centrists have appeared to be moving away
from Biden in recent weeks. The latest came from Rep.]{.underline}**
Abigail **[Spanberger]{.underline}** (D-Va.), **[who is typically
outspoken about the dangers of moving too far to the left ahead of
election time.]{.underline}**

**[She recently gave a speech in Woodbridge where she failed to offer
even a tacit nod to the commander-in-chief]{.underline}**. And Rep. Tim
Ryan (D-Ohio), one of Biden's close personal friends who is running for
the Senate, also decided not to show up for an event the president held
in Cleveland.

**[Strategists have taken note.]{.underline}**

**["You'll probably see moderates like \[Spanberger\] cold shouldering
Biden and progressives pushing him to do more," Farrell
said.]{.underline}**

**[In the Senate, the outlook is more up-in-the-air. With the chamber
currently split 50-50, it is anyone's game.]{.underline}**

# Midterms Aff

## Uniqueness Answers

### Dems Turnout Motivated Now

#### Supreme Court decisions motivate Democrats to vote

**Siders, Politico Political Correspondent, 6-29-22**

\[David, 6-29-22, POLITICO, "Roe jolts the midterms: 5 takeaways from
the 2022 election midpoint",
<https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/29/roe-jolts-the-midterms-5-takeaways-from-the-2022-election-midpoint-00043082>,
accessed on 7-15-22, MG\]

[The better foil for Democrats is almost certain to be the Supreme
Court's overturning on Friday of Roe v. Wade. And Democrats know it.
Judging by Tuesday's primaries, the party in power in Washington will be
running against the court in the fall.]{.underline}

The messaging began even before the decision came down.

[Democratic Rep. Sean Casten, who beat Rep. Marie Newman in a
member-on-member primary in a Chicago-based district, ran ads pledging
to defend abortion rights from "extreme Republicans and right-wing
judges."]{.underline} (Newman had put the matter to voters in personal
terms, describing her own decision, at 19, to have an abortion.) [In the
race to fill the seat now held by retiring Rep. Bobby Rush, an outside
group promoting Karin Norington-Reaves aired TV spots with
black-and-white images of conservative justices, saying Norington-Reaves
would "fight against the tyranny of the good old boys."]{.underline}

[Norington-Reaves was running behind in that primary late Tuesday. But
the ad will likely endure. It's the kind of framing an incumbent party
uses when it needs to run against something -- and Democrats aren't
pleasing voters enough in Washington to be running on what they've
done.]{.underline}

["You can run against the Supreme Court," said Craig Hughes, a
Democratic strategist in Colorado. "I do think Roe will absolutely
matter."]{.underline}

### Dems Win Now

#### GOP win not locked in now -- there's still potential that Dems hold house - seat numbers and ballot testing prove

**Cillizza, CNN Politics Editor-at-Large, 7-14-22 **

\[Chris, 7-14-2022, CNN, "Analysis: Two reasons why all is not lost for
Democrats in the midterms",
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/house-democrats-seats-midterm-elections/index.html>,
accessed on 7-15-22, MG\]

So, when the outlook is that dark and gloomy, any sliver of light is
welcome. And as of late, **[there are a few small signs that the coming
election might not be a total disaster for Democrats]{.underline}**.

**[The first piece of good news comes via the Cook Political Report with
Amy Walter, which released its updated Partisan Voting Index earlier
this week.]{.underline}**

**[The PVI seeks to compare every district in the country to every other
district, providing a sense of where each stands based on the results of
the last two presidential elections.]{.underline}** A district with a
PVI of D+2, for example, voted two points more Democratic than the
national result. A seat with a PV of R+5 voted five points more
Republican. Get it? Got it? Good!

**[In an analysis of the PVI results, the Cook Political
Report\'s]{.underline}** David **[Wasserman concludes that there has
been a somewhat steep decline in the number of competitive seats across
the country following the decennial redistricting process that has taken
place over the past 18 months or so.]{.underline}**

[Wasserman writes:]{.underline}

**["Going by the 2020 presidential result, 'swing seats' cratered by
more than a third: prior to redistricting, there were 51 seats that
either Joe Biden or Donald Trump carried by less than five points. After
the remap, there are just 33 --- a steep 35 percent
drop."]{.underline}**

That decline is slightly less sharp, but still apparent when you
consider the broader spectrum of seats with PVI scores between R+5 and
D+5. Prior to the redistricting process, 90 seats fit that bill. Now
just 82 do.

**[Why is the decline in highly competitive seats a good thing for
Democrats? Simple. While Republicans only need a net gain of four seats
to take control of the House, if they want to achieve a large, governing
majority in 2023, they will need to beat a lot of Democratic incumbents
who sit in seats that Biden won by a considerable amount.]{.underline}**

Which could happen! As Politico wrote earlier this week:

"With just four months until the midterms, Democrats were already on the
defensive in at least 30 highly competitive districts. But Biden's
toxicity has given the GOP optimism about seriously contesting a fresh
crop of about a dozen seats that the president won in 2020 by 9 points
or more --- from western Rhode Island to California's Central Valley to
the suburbs of Arizona's capital. The result is a House map that has
expanded to an uncomfortable place for Democrats."

**[Like I said: Possible! But it's politics 101 that it's harder to beat
a Democratic incumbent in a seat Biden won by 10 points in 2020 than one
in a district Biden carried by 1 point. And to pick up 30+ seats,
Republicans are going to have to beat a whole lot of Democratic
incumbents in districts that clearly lean to their party -- at least at
the presidential level.]{.underline}**

**[The second piece of relative good news for Democrats comes in the
generic ballot test. This is a poll question that seeks to gauge support
for a generic House Democratic candidate against a generic House
Republican candidate and is broadly predictive of which way the national
winds are blowing. (The question usually goes something like: "If the
election were held today, would you vote for the Democratic candidate or
Republican candidate for House?")]{.underline}**

**[A New York Times/Siena College poll out this week showed that among
registered voters nationally, 41% said they would back the Democratic
candidate, while 40% chose the Republican one. (Among voters likely to
cast a ballot this fall, 44% opted for the Republican candidate while
43% chose the Democrat.)]{.underline}**

**[It's also worth noting that the generic ballot question has
historically favored Democrats by a few points, so a virtual tie between
the parties is rightly read as an edge for the
Republicans.]{.underline}**

**[None of this data changes the underlying reality of this election:
Biden is deeply unpopular and, in past midterm elections, when the
president is unpopular, his party in the House tends to sustain heavy
damage.]{.underline}**

[But for Democrats, who have spent the last seven months being barraged
by a seemingly endless stream of bad news, these twin developments
suggest that the worst-case scenario may, in fact, not come to
pass.]{.underline}

#### Democrats can still win now there's more motivation to vote

**Harwood, CNN White House correspondent, 6-26-22**

\[John, 6-26-22, CNN, "Analysis: Democrats still have this glimmer of
hope for the midterm elections",
<https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/26/politics/midterm-elections-democrats/index.html>,
accessed on 7-15-22, MG\]

On that auspicious battlefield, [Democrats have lately acquired fresh
ammunition.]{.underline}

On Capitol Hill, [the House select committee investigating the January
6, 2021, insurrection has laid out in riveting detail the lengths to
which Trump and his allies went in their attempt to overturn the
American people's verdict in the 2020 election.]{.underline} And at the
Supreme Court, new rulings have demonstrated the willingness of
GOP-appointed conservative justices to defy majority opinion and its own
precedents on the most volatile issues roiling the country.

First, [the court expanded the constitutional right to bear arms by
striking down a century-old New York law limiting residents' right to
carry concealed weapons. Then a 5-4 majority erased the constitutional
right to abortion that women had for the last half-century as a result
of its earlier Roe vs. Wade ruling.]{.underline}

[Taken together, those developments highlight Biden's warnings about the
radicalism and extremism of Trump's "Make America Great Again" movement.
Democratic candidates crave the chance to shift the electorate's
attention from the economic concerns weighing down the White House to
more fundamental questions about American democracy.]{.underline}

### Will Pass Now

#### Antitrust reform has the votes to pass -- but window of time is narrow

accessed 7-15-22, AFB\]

**[A new U.S. antitrust bill targeting Big Tech companies might be
doomed to stay in the Senate if it doesn't pass before Congress' summer
recess, Seeking Alpha reported]{.underline}** Sunday (July 10).

**[Called the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, it was intended
to cut back on tech giants' ability to favor their own services over
those of competitors.]{.underline}** The legislation, which has backing
from the U.S. Justice Department, could impact companies like Google,
Apple, Meta and Amazon.

The act, sponsored by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Chuck Grassley,
R-Iowa, could end up delayed as a previously waylaid reconciliation
package takes over everyone's attention, according to a CTFN report
cited by Seeking Alpha.

**[According to Klobuchar, the bill has the 60 votes it needs to pass
the Senate.]{.underline}** However, the office of Sen. Chuck Schumer,
D-N.Y., said it's trying to still get the correct support for the bill
in the Senate.

Per prior reports from CTFN, **[the decision for a floor vote for the
bill will come down to whether Schumer will put the time into it or
not.]{.underline}** The report also noted that Republican senators could
be looking at adding more amendments to the act to "complicate and
delay" things, according to CTFN.

#### Will pass now -- Klobuchar rallying support

**Lima, Washington Post Tech newsletter reporter, 7-12-22**

\[Cristiano, 7-12-22, Washington Post, "Fate of lawmakers\' tech

last month.

### AT -- No Schumer Vote

#### Schumer will bring the bill to a vote

**Krishan, FedScoop Tech writer, 7-14-22**

\[Nihal, 7-14-22, Fed Scoop, "Senate leader Schumer met with Microsoft
President Brad Smith to discuss tech antitrust bills,"
<https://www.fedscoop.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-met-with-microsoft-president-brad-smith-re-anti-big-tech-bills/>,
accessed 7-15-22, AFB\]

Senate Majority Leader Chuck **[Schumer,]{.underline}** D-NY., **[met
with Microsoft President Brad Smith last week while visiting Washington
state and discussed bipartisan tech antitrust legislation that Schumer
is expected to bring up for a vote later this summer]{.underline}**.

**[The top Democrat, who is in charge of the Senate's agenda, discussed
policy with Smith including two bills that are making their way through
Congress right now related to increasing Big Tech competition, the
journalism industry, and data privacy, four sources familiar with the
meeting told FedScoop.]{.underline}**

If they become law, the bills discussed during the meeting could force
Microsoft and other big tech vendors to change how they operate in
consumer and federal markets.

In particular, Senate bills S.2992 and S.2710 would restrict the
collection and use of internal vendor data and place restrictions on Big
Tech companies related to installing and uninstalling software on their
products.

Schumer was spotted in Bellevue, Washington last week and is expected to
have traveled to the state to meet with tech executives like Smith and
for fundraising purposes.

Liberal advocacy groups have recently called on Schumer to disclose any
"dark money" or hidden funds that he and other Democrats have received
from Big Tech companies like Microsoft in order to remove the appearance
of any conflict of interest.

The American Innovation and Choice Online Act (S.2992), would prevent
tech giants like Amazon from unduly favoring their own products on their
websites or creating cheaper copycats of existing products using
internal data.

Meanwhile, the Open App Markets Act (S.2710) would regulate the
management of Apple, Google and potentially Microsoft's app stores,
which advocates say would enable greater competition on the platforms.

**[These are the two most significant antitrust bills that Schumer
supports, and which the Senate majority leader is expected to bring up
for a vote later this summer. The bills, which have bipartisan backing,
are expected to have enough support pass within Congress and become law
if they are bought up for a vote.]{.underline}**

favor]{.underline}**.19 **[Given the importance of digital platform
commerce to the American economy---be it e-commerce, mobile
applications, or other software---abuses such as anti-competitive
self-preferencing can and do have wide-ranging effects on commerce and
consumers.]{.underline}** **[American Innovation]{.underline}** and Open
App Markets **[aim to limit the largest platforms' ability to manipulate
these markets to their benefit.]{.underline}** The following analysis is
based on the latest version of each bill: the manager's amendment to
American Innovation, released in late May, and the version of Open App
Markets that passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee in early
2022.20 As with any legislation, there may be further changes as the
bills make their way to the Senate floor.

The American Innovation and Choice Online Act

**[American Innovation]{.underline}** (S. 2992) **[seeks to
advance]{.underline}** a principal issue of **[economic
fairness]{.underline}** online. **[It contends that gatekeeper digital
platform companies should not be able to give themselves an advantage
over other commercial competitors (including smaller
businesses)]{.underline}** trying to compete with them if it harms
competition, nor should companies be able to arbitrarily discriminate
among businesses that rely on their platform.21 **[Self-preferencing and
discrimination in these ways undermine competition, deter investment and
innovation in areas with dominant gatekeepers, deprive businesses of
opportunity, and deprive consumers of real choice]{.underline}**.22
**[American Innovation prohibits a number of unfair, discriminatory
behaviors for covered platforms]{.underline}**,23 **[giving competitors
a chance to innovate and a fair shot at providing new choices to the
American people]{.underline}**. New services from dominant platforms
should compete and succeed with consumers on their commercial
merits---not simply because they can leverage their gatekeeper position
to close the door on competitors and extend the reach of first-party
services.24

**[American Innovation would apply to the major business lines of the
largest gatekeeping internet companies. The legislation would pertain to
those online platforms that act as critical trading
partners,]{.underline}** have more than 50 million monthly active U.S.
users or 1 billion worldwide users, more than 100,000 active U.S.
business users, and record net annual sales or market capitalization of
more than \$550 billion---among other qualifications.25 Products or
business lines from Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft, TikTok,
and others will be covered.26 The legislation's criteria to determine a
covered online platform, well-researched following numerous Senate
hearings, address those platforms **[that control key chokepoints of
digital markets and on which self-preferencing and discriminatory
behavior create the most damage to competition.]{.underline}** The bill
covers only a handful of business lines from a few companies now, but
its criteria are drafted in such a way that they would apply
consistently to any future online platforms that gain similar market
power.

### AT -- Antitrust Reform Raises Cost/Hurts Innovation

#### Antitrust reform will reduce Big Tech advantages, bolstering incentives for innovation and reducing costs

**[People will enjoy cost savings on mobile digital
services:]{.underline}** The Apple/Google mobile smartphone duopoly
imposes high costs for mobile applications to sell via mobile app
stores. These fees, in turn, are passed on in the form of higher costs
to consumers.37 **[Reintroducing competition in app
stores,]{.underline}**38 removing competitive pricing restrictions,39
and giving developers more selling options40 w**[ill generate more
competitive markets for digital applications---ultimately producing
lower costs for the services Americans use daily.]{.underline}**

**[People would likely enjoy e-commerce cost savings: Amazon's market
power in e-commerce has given it the power to charge high costs for
sellers, which are passed on to consumers.]{.underline}** A recent
analysis from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance found that, "Using a
variety of fees, Amazon now pockets a 34 percent cut of the revenue
earned by independent sellers on its site ... That's up from 30 percent
in 2018, and 19 percent in 2014."41 These costs are passed onto
consumers in the form of higher prices for goods bought on Amazon. In
the near term, the bills prohibit rules that would force sellers to use
extra services in order to compete effectively on the platform.42 In the
long term, the bills will introduce greater competition online. Both may
reduce high platform fees that get passed on to American consumers.

People will have more options to purchase digital goods from their
phones: Americans interested in subscribing to popular online services
using their mobile phones often do not have that option. App providers
restrict sign-ups on mobile because they find the required fees too high
to justify (sometimes referred to as an app store "tax"43). For example,
today, the option to subscribe to Spotify is not enabled within Spotify
mobile applications because of the high cost of digital purchases on the
Apple and Android mobile operating systems. American Innovation and Open
App Markets would allow for alternative payment options that remove
these inconvenient barriers.44

People will have more choices when it comes to convenience, privacy, and
safety: Americans will have greater choice and control over the digital
environments they use every day. People who use mobile phones would be
able to select their preferred default mapping application instead of
encountering unexpected user experience obstacles such as being forced
to manually copy and paste addresses between apps.45 People who value
their privacy would be able to remove insecure mobile applications and
choose more privacy-sensitive services.46 Greater choice can enable
Americans with different safety needs and interests to customize their
digital environments more appropriately, while maintaining everyone's
ability to continue using the services they currently enjoy.

Developers can be honest with people about functionality restrictions:
Popular consumer applications would be able to explain restrictions on
their smartphone apps---behaving more consistently with consumer
expectations. For example, there are millions of Amazon Kindle owners
who can read the Kindle eBooks they've purchased on their iPhone
app---yet they cannot purchase Kindle eBooks through the iPhone app
because Amazon has chosen not to enable this feature due to the high
price charged by app stores for digital purchases. Amazon cannot even
explain in its Kindle iPhone app that the only way to purchase Kindle
eBooks on the iPhone is via the Amazon.com website accessed on a mobile
web browser due to communications restrictions from Apple.47 Open App
Markets would remove restrictions on explaining alternatives to mobile
app users.48 This would immediately allow Amazon to explain in its
iPhone app how to purchase Kindle eBooks on an iPhone.

Online mobile gaming could finally be unlocked for billions of gaming
fans across the world: Restrictions from the app stores have prevented
the world's most popular games from being utilized by the world's most
ubiquitous computing devices. This has held back the development of more
robust mobile streaming game services. Open App Markets49 would allow
Epic Games' popular Fortnite game to return to Apple's App Store;
Fortnite pursued recent antitrust litigation against Apple on these
issues, with a mixed ruling for both sides in district court that both
Apple and Epic are appealing.50 It would also help ensure that the
popular metaverse Roblox could continue to remain on Apple's App Store
if Apple were to suddenly classify it a game instead of "an experience";
Roblox recently supported Apple over Fortnite in their ongoing
litigation.51 Finally, it would allow competitive development of the
next generation of streaming mobile games without the extensive
restrictions currently imposed on development.52

**[People can enjoy the benefits of innovation and quality improvement
incentivized by real competition: By introducing greater competition
with major consumer technology services and between the platforms that
would be covered by American Innovation, Congress can ensure that
Americans see real innovation within the consumer technology services
they use every day.]{.underline}** **[Experts have noted that a lack of
competition discourages innovation]{.underline}**,53 **[and as CAP has
previously written, "centralization of research and development (R&D)
resources at dominant \[technology\] firms may additionally result in
selective or reduced innovation]{.underline}**."54 **[These bills will
help open markets for new competitors who may introduce novel,
cost-saving, and quality-enhancing services. Enhanced competitive
pressure can spur improvements and innovations within the services
people already love.]{.underline}** **[More equitable competition on
covered platforms and within app stores can ensure that specialty
services have a fair shot at bringing their offerings to market and
reaching consumers who need them. Rules that ensure fair competition
online increase the ability of tech companies to continue delivering
innovations to Americans---and ensure ongoing competitive incentives to
do so]{.underline}**.

**[Even Big Tech will experience benefits from these
protections]{.underline}**

**[Industry lobbyists have driven much of the public conversation about
restrictions on Big Tech.]{.underline}** Yet the **[ways in which even
these companies will enjoy benefits under these bills have been
overlooked. Large online platforms must also navigate their services
through the anti-competitive restrictions of other gatekeeper online
platforms---for example, how Google is dependent on the Apple App Store
for the distribution of the Google Maps application for iPhones. These
bills would provide protections for everyone on the covered platforms,
including affected business lines of the other covered
entities]{.underline}**.63 These include, for example, gains for Apple's
new streaming service, Apple TV+, which recently reduced functionality
of its Android TV app, likely because it did not want to pay the app tax
to Google (which mirrors the percentage Apple takes from apps on its
platform).64 The Open App Markets Act would give Apple a chance to
increase the functionality of its app on the Android TV platform or
communicate about alternatives. Similarly, as noted above, the full
functionality to buy Amazon Kindle eBooks would likely become available
via the Kindle mobile apps on iPhone and Android, which would increase
sales of Kindle eBooks.

**[To date, those few companies affected by these bills have focused on
the potential negative effects while remaining silent on the tremendous
benefits---and profits---their products would gain from increased access
and protection for other covered platforms.]{.underline}** The exception
is Microsoft, which has announced its voluntary compliance with many of
the rules laid out in Open App Markets. Brad Smith, Microsoft's
president, has tweeted in support of the bill.65 **[Consumers too would
significantly benefit from additional competition among Big Tech
companies.]{.underline}**

**[Ample evidence illustrates how Big Tech has engaged in
anticompetitive behavior that has hurt businesses and consumers. If

**[Invoking the histories of once-dominant companies like General

businesses]{.underline}**

**[Today, small and medium-sized businesses have little choice but to
build, sell, advertise, or operate on monopolistic online platforms;
they are essential for many business operations]{.underline}**.55 **[The
bills would ensure that, as controllers of the major U.S. digital
platforms, companies do not abuse their positions to prevent small and
medium-sized businesses from competing. Such new protections and rights
mean that online businesses and services providers will have access to
online infrastructure on equal terms with competitors, including
businesses operated by the platforms. The bills provide an improved
chance at growing a business that is not undermined by anti-competitive
actions from the platforms on which they rely to reach
consumers.]{.underline}**56 For the very largest online platforms,
American Innovation and Open App Markets would change the laws to ensure
that:

**[Companies can no longer design algorithms to favor their own
products: The bills end an e-commerce or search platform's ability to
juice its ranking, search, review systems, and design to favor its own
products over those of competitors]{.underline}**.57 **[This will level
the playing field for other businesses and ensure that consumers are
getting a clearer picture of their options]{.underline}**.

**[Companies can no longer prevent smaller businesses from communicating
with customers: The bills provide new protections to small businesses
online to ensure they can access data]{.underline}** 58 and contact
consumers when they do business on major platforms.59 **[It also
prevents platform companies from using those data and insights to
unfairly compete against them.]{.underline}**60

**[Companies can no longer impose "pay to play" restrictions for
businesses on major platforms: The bills prevent big companies from
requiring that businesses pay to play]{.underline}**---buy extra goods
and services just to have a chance of succeeding on the platform61 or
use companies' proprietary payment processor systems.62

**[Such new protections mean that online businesses and service
providers can have an improved chance at growing their business because
the platforms will operate on a level playing field, no longer creating
arbitrary obstacles to disadvantage them or extract rents from
them.]{.underline}**

#### Antitrust reform won't hamper cybersecurity -- multiple safeguards in place to prevent risks

Concerns around national security

**[Some national security experts and technology sector industry groups
have argued the new antitrust bills put American national security at
risk]{.underline}**.120 **[These critiques have suggested that
regulating anti-competitive behavior by U.S. tech giants may hamper
their ability to compete globally or hinder cybersecurity. Other
national security leaders have supported the bills and argued that they
will help the American economy and support consumers without those
purported downsides.]{.underline}**121

**[Looking at the discussion specifically around American Innovation, a
recurring concern has been whether removing anti-competitive data
restrictions and allowing commercial data-sharing would enable the
Chinese government or other foreign governments to access data about
Americans]{.underline}**.122 The provision in question, Section 3(a)(7),
states that it would be unlawful for a covered platform to:

materially restrict or impede a business user from accessing data
generated on the covered platform by the activities of the business
user, or through an interaction of a covered platform user with the
products or services of the business user, such as by establishing
contractual or technical restrictions that prevent the portability by
the business user to other systems or applications of the data of the
business user.

Critics have claimed this provision would "require large U.S. technology
companies to disclose user data to competitors---including those that
are foreign-controlled."123 As Google's president of global affairs
wrote about a Senate bill that the authors presume to be American
Innovation, "it says nothing about provisions that could require sharing
data with countless other bad actors and foreign companies." (The
presumption is that this blog post refers to American innovation, given
that it was posted before the Senate Judiciary committee markup of
American Innovation and is updated to reference "an amendment to the
Senate bill" that mirrors the manager's amendment introduced and adopted
ahead of the markup of American Innovation.)124

Some have interpreted related provisions around interoperability in
American Innovation125 to suggest that "requiring non-discriminatory
access for all 'business users' (broadly defined to include foreign
rivals) on U.S. digital platforms would provide an open door for foreign
adversaries to gain access to the software and hardware of American
technology companies."126 Others have claimed that with interoperability
"there is a significant risk that companies receiving ported data would
turn the data over to foreign government authorities or use them for
other nefarious purposes."127

**[These critiques of American Innovation are deeply misleading. The
data covered are clearly only a business user's own data: that which it
has generated during its business activities on a covered
platform]{.underline}**.128 **[It is not a requirement that a major
platform must hand over all the data it has about its users to any
business users on the platform. This is simply a requirement that a
business have access to data from its own usage of the platform to
conduct business with its customers---the same kind of data a business
might generate and have access to in any other sphere of
commerce.]{.underline}** Assuming an inability of businesses to access,
export, and save their own business data while covered platforms can
access that same data and use it to their competitive advantage is
unreasonable.

**[Upon closer examination, many of the documents published highlighting
national security criticisms are focused on provisions from the six
antitrust bills that passed out of the House Judiciary Committee in
2021]{.underline}**.129 Only one of the House bills---HR. 3816, the
American Choice and Innovation Online Act130---has a Senate companion
bill that has passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the
similarly named S. 2992 (the American Innovation and Choice Online Act),
which is analyzed here.131 **[Even specific criticisms of American
Innovation or Open App Markets are often intermixed with criticisms of
the House bills, which makes analyzing some of these charges very
difficult, as they are simply not applicable to the two Senate bills
that are the focus of this report]{.underline}**. This can create
challenges in deciphering specific criticism of the two senate bills;
CAP flags for the reader's context.

**[Sens. Klobuchar and Grassley have made numerous good-faith attempts
to minimize risks to national security in American Innovation, even
within the limited scope of data described above. For example, an
amendment from Sen.]{.underline}** John **[Cornyn]{.underline}** (R-TX)
**[was incorporated during the markup of American Innovation to address
concerns around national security risks,]{.underline}**132 i**[ncluding
specific language to prevent data-sharing with the Chinese
government.]{.underline}**133 Accordingly, the definition of "business
user" allows for covered platforms to deny any requests from any
business user who is a clear national security risk or "foreign
adversary."134 American Innovation defines "business user" as "a person
that uses or is likely to use a covered platform for the advertising,
sale, or provision of products or services."135 This definition is
necessarily broad and would have to include "foreign rivals" because
almost all foreign businesses operating online do business with covered
platforms under American Innovation given their incredible reach. **[But
the claim that it "would provide an open door for foreign
adversaries"]{.underline}**136 **[ignores that the act's definition of
"business user" specifically names and excludes "foreign adversaries,"
stating that a business user "does not include a person that---(i) is a
clear national security risk; or (ii) is controlled by the Government of
the People's Republic of China or the government of another foreign
adversary."]{.underline}**137 **[This means that covered platforms
outright do not have to give access to or comply with requests from any
business user who is a clear national security risk. In addition, to
address specific concerns raised around the nondiscriminatory
interoperability provision, the most recent manager's amendment to
American Innovation allows for additional coverage of cybersecurity
measures by adding "except where such access would lead to a significant
cybersecurity risk.]{.underline}**"138

**[American Innovation's affirmative defenses allow a covered platform
to limit the data accessed by any business user, not just those who
might be controlled by a foreign government,]{.underline}** to "protect
safety, user privacy, the security of non-public data, or the security
of the covered platform," even if it materially harms competition.139
The bill also instructs the FTC to "define the term data for the purpose
of implementing and enforcing this Act,"140 which is likely to identify
certain kinds of data, such as personally identifiable information that
would not otherwise be available to a business user, could be withheld
by a covered platform from all business users based on privacy, safety,
and security. Drawing on its privacy experience, the FTC can further
ensure clarity around protecting privacy rights as it issues enforcement
guidance, working with the Department of Justice, which itself brings
national security expertise.141

Because these data are the company's own business data, most or all are
already held by the company and already at risk of being seized by a
foreign government with jurisdiction. If critics' arguments about
foreign government data access142 are to be carried out to their logical
conclusion, it appears critics are arguing that foreign companies should
not be allowed to do business with U.S. covered platforms at all: If
risk of foreign government access to business data of foreign companies
on U.S. platforms is too great, then the risks critics are concerned
about already exist. Negligible additional risk is created by the bills.
A position that foreign companies---many of whom also have little choice
but to use major U.S. covered platforms---should not be allowed to do
business on U.S. platforms seems misguided. As noted above, where there
are particular security concerns about foreign governments' access,
American Innovation specifically includes numerous provisions that
thoroughly address concerns around national security risks, foreign
adversaries, or foreign governments143 and provide ample defenses around
privacy, safety, and security.144

**[Finally, should a foreign company wish to object to denial of data
access for some reason other than the various affirmative defenses and
protections outlined above, it would have almost no legal
recourse.]{.underline}** The lack of a private right of action under
American Innovation means that a foreign company that feels aggrieved
would need to convince the DOJ, the FTC, or a state attorney general145
to file suit on its behalf in U.S. federal district court,146 a highly
unlikely occurrence.

### AT -- Economic Decline Doesn't Cause War

#### Their defense is out of date -- current circumstances offer the perfect storm for instability following economic decline

**[One of the remarkable things about the global economic order since
World War II has been the flexibility of governments in responding to
serious crises. From stagflation and the collapse of the Bretton Woods
currency regime in the 1970s to the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s
to the global financial crisis in this century, the world's major
economies have proven surprisingly adept at finding ways to cooperate to
address serious challenges]{.underline}**.

**[This time around, that lucky streak may finally break. The current
concatenation of problems---the Russia-Ukraine war, inflation, global
food and energy shortages, unwinding asset bubbles in the United States,
debt crises in developing countries, and the lingering impacts of
COVID-19-related shutdowns and supply chain bottlenecks---may be the
most serious crisis of them all]{.underline}**, not least because
central banks can't print wheat and gasoline. Yet **[there are few signs
of the collective responses that will be needed to meet these
challenges. Global cooperation has never been more urgent---and seemed
less likely]{.underline}**.

Fraying cooperation is, ironically, mostly a consequence of past
successes. The world's past ability to manage crises, transcend
disruptions, and restore the trajectory of global growth means that many
more **[countries]{.underline}** today **[have become rich enough to
wield influence and demand their interests be considered]{.underline}**.
Others are pursuing territorial or ideological goals they consider more
urgent than immediate economic priorities. As a result, consensus has
become almost impossible to find. The upshot is that
**[in]{.underline}** this **[crisis]{.underline}**, **[the world will be
condemned to a series of competing and partial responses rather than
again finding a way to come together to address the
challenge.]{.underline}**

Economic recovery efforts since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis
have mainly depended on unconventional monetary policies. As fears rise
of yet another international **[financial crisis, there are growing
concerns about the increased possibility of large-scale military
conflict]{.underline}**.

More worryingly, in the current political landscape, prolonged
**[economic crisis, combined with rising economic inequality,
chauvinistic ethno-populism as well as aggressive jingoist rhetoric,
including threats, could easily spin out of control and 'morph' into
military conflict, and worse, world war]{.underline}**.

Crisis responses limited The 2008-2009 global financial crisis almost
'bankrupted' governments and caused systemic collapse. Policymakers
managed to pull the world economy from the brink, but soon switched from
counter-cyclical fiscal efforts to unconventional monetary measures,
primarily 'quantitative easing' and very low, if not negative real
interest rates.

But while these monetary interventions averted realization of the worst
fears at the time by turning the US economy around, they did little to
address underlying economic weaknesses, largely due to the ascendance of
finance in recent decades at the expense of the real economy. Since
then, despite promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously
pursued, let alone achieved, such needed reforms.

Instead, ostensible structural reformers have taken advantage of the
crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts to further 'casualize'
labour markets. This lack of structural reform has meant that the
unprecedented liquidity central banks injected into economies has not
been well allocated to stimulate resurgence of the real economy.

From bust to bubble Instead, easy credit raised asset prices to levels
even higher than those prevailing before 2008. US house prices are now
8% more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006, while its
price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in 2008 and in
1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great Depression.

As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another economic
crisis --- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy has become
less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions --- is considered
likely. A decade of such unconventional monetary policies, with very low
interest rates, has greatly depleted their ability to revive the
economy.

The implications beyond the economy of such developments and policy
responses are already being seen. **[Prolonged economic distress has
worsened public antipathy towards the culturally alien --- not only
abroad, but also within]{.underline}**. **[Thus, another round of
economic stress is deemed likely to foment unrest, conflict, even war as
it is blamed on the foreign]{.underline}**.

**[International trade shrank by two-thirds within half a decade after
the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930]{.underline}**, at the
start of the Great Depression, ostensibly to protect American workers
and farmers from foreign competition!

Liberalization's discontents **[Rising economic insecurity, inequalities
and deprivation are expected to strengthen ethno-populist and jingoistic
nationalist sentiments, and increase social tensions and turmoil,
especially among the growing precariat and others who feel vulnerable or
threatened]{.underline}**.

Thus, **[ethno-populist inspired chauvinistic nationalism may exacerbate
tensions, leading to conflicts and tensions among countries, as in the
1930s]{.underline}**. Opportunistic leaders have been blaming such
misfortunes on outsiders and may seek to reverse policies associated
with the perceived causes, such as 'globalist' economic liberalization.

Policies which successfully check such problems may reduce social
tensions, as well as the likelihood of social turmoil and conflict,
including among countries. However, these may also inadvertently
exacerbate problems. The recent spread of anti-globalization sentiment
appears correlated to slow, if not negative per capita income growth and
increased economic inequality.

To be sure, globalization and liberalization are statistically
associated with growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism.
Declining real incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently
strengthened ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening
economic liberalization itself, both within and among countries.

Insecurity, populism, conflict Thomas Piketty has argued that a sudden
increase in income inequality is often followed by a great crisis.
Although causality is difficult to prove, with wealth and income
inequality now at historical highs, this should give cause for concern.

Of course, other **[factors also contribute to or exacerbate civil and
international tensions, with some due to policies intended for other
purposes]{.underline}**. Nevertheless, **[even if unintended, such
developments could inadvertently catalyse future crises and
conflicts]{.underline}**.

**[Publics often have good reason to be restless, if not angry, but the
emotional appeals of ethno-populism and jingoistic nationalism are
leading to chauvinistic policy measures which only make things
worse.]{.underline}**

**[At the international level, despite the world's unprecedented and
still growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is increasingly being
eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to unilateral, sovereigntist
policies without bothering to even build coalitions with its usual
allies.]{.underline}**

**[Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg Thus, protracted economic distress,
economic conflicts or another financial crisis could lead to military
confrontation by the protagonists, even if unintended]{.underline}**.
Less than a decade after the Great Depression started, the Second World
War had begun as the Axis powers challenged the earlier entrenched
colonial powers.

They patently ignored Thucydides' warning, in chronicling the
Peloponnesian wars over two millennia before, when the rise of Athens
threatened the established dominance of Sparta!

Anticipating and addressing such possibilities may well serve to help
avoid otherwise imminent disasters by undertaking pre-emptive collective
action, as difficult as that may be.

The international community has no excuse for being like the owners and
captain of the Titanic, conceitedly convinced that no iceberg could
possibly sink the great ship.

### AT -- Economic Decline Now/Inevitable

#### Status quo decline is overstated -- several indicators suggest no collapse coming now

**Rosalsky, NPR Planet Money, 5-31-22**

**\[**Greg, 5-31-22, NPR, "Fear The Vibe Shift: Are We Entering A
Recession? "NPR,
<https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2022/05/31/1101774189/fear-the-vibe-shift-are-we-entering-a-recession>,
accessed 7-14-22\]

It\'s being whispered and murmured about. The president is facing
questions about it. Business leaders and investors are already bracing
for it. **[The specter of recession is once again rearing its monstrous
head]{.underline}**.

**[It\'s feasible that the economy could chug along without any bumps or
crashes]{.underline}**. But **[boom-and-bust cycles remain a seemingly
inescapable feature of capitalist economies]{.underline}**. Some
countries have done well avoiding busts. Starting in 1991, Australia had
a run of almost 29 years without a recession, the longest stretch of
economic growth of any nation in modern history. That ended in 2020,
when the pandemic led to a big contraction --- and Australia (briefly)
succumbed to the beast.

While Australia had zero recessions between 1991 and 2020, the United
States had two, a mild one in 2001, amid the dotcom crash and the 9/11
terrorist attacks; and a catastrophic one known as the Great Recession,
between 2007 and 2009. Since 1854, the first year for which we have
official economic data, **[the United States has experienced 35
recessions]{.underline}**.

The National Bureau of Economic Research\'s Business Cycle Dating
Committee is the official body that keeps track of recessions in the
U.S. The committee has traditionally defined recessions as \"a
significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the
economy and that lasts more than a few months.\" However, it sort of
fudged this definition when it declared that the pandemic downturn was a
recession. **[The pandemic recession lasted only two months --- the
shortest recession in American history]{.underline}** --- but, the
committee says, \"the drop in activity had been so great and so widely
diffused throughout the economy that the downturn should be classified
as a recession even if it proved to be quite brief.\"

**[Despite all the talk about the U.S. entering another recession, the
unemployment rate of 3.6% remains historically low, job growth remains
strong, and, notwithstanding inflation, consumer spending continues to
be like a firehose]{.underline}**. That said, the U.S. economy shrank by
an annualized rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2022, which
means **[we may already be well on our way to the technical definition
of a recession, albeit maybe a teeny-tiny one]{.underline}**.

#### Growth may be weak but decline will not occur

**Association of Chartered Certified Accountants** **7-14-22**

\["Global Economy Set for Weak Growth as Financial Professionals\'
Confidence Drops Sharply," PR NEWSWIRE,

accessed 7-15-22\]

**[The Q2 Global Economic Conditions Survey]{.underline}** (GECS) --
conducted in mid-June -- **[pointed to a decisive deterioration in the
global economic outlook due to the effects of the war in Ukraine and the
surge in inflation across much of the world]{.underline}**.

**[But while risks have risen, indications are that a global recession
will be avoided]{.underline}**.

However, while confidence among financial professionals has dropped
sharply, the **[global confidence level remains above the
low-point]{.underline}** reached at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The two \"**[fear\" indices]{.underline}** -- reflecting the level of
concern that customers and suppliers may go out of business -- **[were
little changed]{.underline}** in the Q2 survey, both edging slightly
higher. Both indices have fallen back from the extreme levels seen in
2020 but are still above pre-pandemic levels.

The largest fall in confidence occurred in the Middle East, a region
more exposed to trade with Russia/Ukraine, while North America and
Western Europe recorded especially large falls due to big jumps in
inflation in recent months. Only in North America has confidence fallen
back to levels seen during the height of economic uncertainty in 2020.
Elsewhere, the falls in confidence were still significant, but more
modest.

**[While the outlook has darkened, the drop in confidence is much
greater than the reported drop in orders. Indeed orders -- a lead
indicator of economic activity -- are above their long-run average. The
employment index is also well above its long-run average]{.underline}**,
despite dropping in Q2. **[Jobs markets are tight and employment is
rising in many economies]{.underline}**, providing some offset to the
effects of high inflation on real incomes.

In a list of top concerns since the Q1 survey, financial professionals
have swapped concerns over COVID for worries about inflation and rising
interest rates. But for the third GECS in a row, supply shortages and
supply chain issues have remained the highest ranked risk. Hope that
this issue would fade in importance as 2022 progressed is fading.

\"**[Post-pandemic recovery has now given way to negligible economic
growth]{.underline}**, elevated inflation, and extreme uncertainty,\"
said Jamie Lyon, Head of Skills, Sectors and Technology at ACCA. \"The
war in Ukraine has given inflation a further boost by pushing commodity
prices higher. But inflation was already high and rising before the war
started in February: a strong rebound in demand fuelled by a massive
monetary and fiscal response to the COVID pandemic had run up against
supply shortages, resulting in a surge in price pressures.\"

Loreal Jiles, vice president of research and thought leadership at IMA
added: \"High inflation is resulting in falls in real disposable incomes
putting downward pressure on private demand, especially household
consumption. Prices of both food and energy are rising rapidly. The
result is a cost-of-living crunch on low-income households in advanced
economies and across virtually all low and middle-income countries,
where these two categories account for a high share of spending.\"

Jamie Lyon concluded: \"**[Risks of a global recession have increased
but our central case is that growth will be positive if rather
weak]{.underline}**. Employment growth may support total consumption.
Nonetheless, with the exception of the COVID recession of 2020, we
expect global GDP growth this year and next will be the weakest since
the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-09.\"

**[But to date, a vast majority of senators have not publicly indicated
how they would vote on the measures, S.2992 and S.2710, setting up a
historic test of congressional efforts to rein in Silicon Valley
behemoths like Facebook and Google]{.underline}**. Combined, the bills
would block the tech giants from favoring their own products and impose
new restrictions on their app stores.

**[The Technology 202 asked the offices of all 100 senators last week
whether they support or oppose the two bills and would vote in favor of
or against them on the floor.]{.underline}**

**[The responses show that even as public support for the bills has
grown, key senators who may help decide the fate of the proposals remain
on the fence, while others may be awaiting additional
changes.]{.underline}**

**[Here's our informal whip count on where things stand:]{.underline}**

Public support slowly builds, with Schumer's backing

**[Both bills have 13 sponsors in the Senate, meaning that lawmakers
would need to secure an additional 47 supporters to pass them due to the
chamber's filibuster rules. According to our review, they have
officially picked up several in addition to those groups.]{.underline}**

Sens. Tina **[Smith]{.underline}** (D-Minn.) **[and]{.underline}**
Bernie **[Sanders]{.underline}** (I-Vt.) **[support both of the
bills]{.underline}** and would vote in favor of them, according to
spokespeople. **[The offices of other senators who are co-sponsors of
one of the bills but not the other confirmed that they back both. That
includes]{.underline}** Sen. Elizabeth **[Warren]{.underline}**
(D-Mass.), Mark R. **[Warner]{.underline}** (D-Va.)
**[and]{.underline}** Sheldon **[Whitehouse]{.underline}** (D-R.I.).

"It's past time for Congress to hold Big Tech accountable and start
reining in their anti-competitive behavior, and I support these bills as
an important step in the right direction," Warren said in a statement.

Most notably, Senate Majority Leader Charles E. **[Schumer (D-N.Y.) ---
who controls whether the bills get a floor vote --- affirmed through a
spokesperson that he backs both bills. "Leader Schumer supports both
bills and would vote yes," said spokesperson]{.underline}** Justin
**[Goodman]{.underline}**.

Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the top Republican on the Senate antitrust
panel, said that while there "are a few more edits" that he is working
with co-sponsors to get implemented into the app store bill (S.2710) he
is "optimistic that we can get to a good place on this bill, whether in
the remainder of this Congress or in the next.\"

**[Still, that leaves the number of senators willing to publicly support
both bills well short of the sixty needed to pass.]{.underline}**

**[A slew of senators remain undecided or noncommittal]{.underline}**

**[Twelve lawmakers said they are still reviewing the legislation:
Sens]{.underline}**. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), Rick Scott (R-Fla.),
Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Susan Collins (R-Maine), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.),
Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.),
Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Tim Scott (R-S.C.), Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Ted
Cruz (R-Tex.).

**[That batch notably includes two Senate Democrats, Coons and Ossoff,
who initially voted to advance the proposals out of committee but
expressed lingering reservations at the time. The remarks suggest they
are not yet ready to commit to supporting the bills' final passage. The
list also includes lawmakers like Collins who often serve as swing votes
in the chamber.]{.underline}**

"Should these bills come before the full Senate, I will carefully review
them to ensure that they are fair and do not negatively affect
consumers, small businesses, or American competitiveness," Collins said
in a statement.

**[Some offices, including those of Hyde-Smith and Tim Scott, cited
policies against previewing their voting positions, while others said
they are unsure where they will land.]{.underline}**

**["Sen. Coons is still considering both pieces of legislation right now
and hasn't made a final decision on which way he'll vote," said
spokesperson]{.underline}** Will **[Baskin-Gerwitz.]{.underline}**

Spokespeople for four senators declined to comment: Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Mitt
Romney (R-Utah) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.). Leahy is another Democrat
who had backed the bills in committee.

**[The bills have their share of detractors, too]{.underline}**

**[A few lawmakers, including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and John Cornyn
(R-Tex.), suggested they would vote against the bills, with Paul's
office citing an op-ed decrying the "antitrust crusade" and Cornyn's
office pointing to his committee votes against the bills. Five other
Republicans also voted against Klobuchar's proposal, S.2992, in
committee]{.underline}**.

Lee said he is still "deeply worried" about the "unintended
consequences" of Klobuchar's bill, which targets what's known as
"self-preferencing" by tech companies.

"At this point, I believe we would be better off waiting until
Republicans regain control of Congress and can take the lead in drafting
a bill that fights Big Tech abuses without granting broad new powers to
the Biden FTC that is already out of control," Lee said of the bill.

A spokesperson for Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) indicated she will
likely vote against Klobuchar's bill, saying that as "currently drafted,
Sen. Blackburn's committee vote will reflect her floor vote." Blackburn
is leading the app store bill with Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

Spokespeople for Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) did not return requests for
comment. But during a brief interview on Capitol Hill last month, Wyden
said he was not ready to support the bills, citing concerns they could
hinder content moderation efforts. "I'm not there now, no," Wyden told
me.

**[A majority of the Senate did not return requests for comment, meaning
that the results were ultimately inconclusive. But the responses suggest
proponents' confidence may be overstated.]{.underline}**

**[It was an attention-grabbing assertion that made headlines around the
world: U.S. officials said they had indications suggesting Russia might
be preparing to use chemical agents in Ukraine]{.underline}**

President Joe **[Biden later said it publicly]{.underline}**. But three
U.S. officials told NBC News this week there is no evidence Russia has
brought any chemical weapons near Ukraine. **[They said the U.S.
released the information to deter Russia from using the banned
munitions.]{.underline}**

**[It's one of a string of examples of the Biden administration's
breaking with recent precedent by deploying declassified intelligence as
part of an information war against Russia.]{.underline}** The
administration has done so even when the intelligence wasn't rock solid,
officials said, to keep Russian President Vladimir Putin off balance.
Coordinated by the White House National Security Council, the
unprecedented intelligence releases have been so frequent and
voluminous, officials said, that intelligence agencies had to devote
more staff members to work on the declassification process, scrubbing
the information so it wouldn't betray sources and methods.

**[Observers of all stripes have called it a bold and so far successful
strategy]{.underline}** --- although not one without risks.

**["It's the most amazing display of intelligence as an instrument of
state power that I have seen or that I've heard of since the Cuban
Missile Crisis," said Tim Weiner, the author of a 2006 history of the
CIA and 2020's "The Folly and the Glory," a look at the U.S.-Russia
rivalry over decades. "It has certainly blunted and defused the
disinformation weaponry of the Kremlin."]{.underline}**

**[Four days before the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the
U.S. publicized spy plane photos to show the Soviet Union had deployed
nuclear missiles not far from Florida's coast. The Biden administration
began releasing reams of intelligence about what it said were Putin's
plans and intentions even before the invasion of Ukraine
began.]{.underline}**

Just this week, national security adviser Jake Sullivan stood at the
White House podium and read out what officials said was more
declassified intelligence, asserting that Russia's pullout from areas
around Kyiv wasn't a retreat but a strategic redeployment that signals a
significant assault on eastern and southern Ukraine, one that U.S.
officials believe could be a protracted and bloody fight.

**[The idea is to pre-empt and disrupt the Kremlin's tactics, complicate
its military campaign, "undermine Moscow's propaganda and prevent Russia
from defining how the war is perceived in the world," said a Western
government official familiar with the strategy.]{.underline}**

Multiple U.S. officials acknowledged that the U.S. has used information
as a weapon even when confidence in the accuracy of the information
wasn't high. Sometimes it has used low-confidence intelligence for
deterrent effect, as with chemical agents, and other times, as an
official put it, the U.S. is just "trying to get inside Putin's head."

Some officials believe, however, that trying to get into Putin's head is
a meaningless exercise, because he will do what he wants regardless.

After this story was published, a U.S. official told NBC News that "the
U.S. government's effort to strategically downgrade intelligence to
share with allies and the public is underpinned by a rigorous review
process by the National Security Council and the Intelligence Community
to validate the quality of the information and protect sources and
methods." The official added that "we only approve the release of
intelligence if we are confident those two requirements are met."

'Spot on'

**[The biggest success of the U.S. information offensive may have been
delaying the invasion itself by weeks or months, which officials believe
they did with accurate predictions that Russia intended to attack, based
on definitive intelligence. By the time Russia moved its troops in, the
West presented a unified front.]{.underline}**

**[Before the invasion, the U.S. asserted that Russia intended to stage
a false flag attack against members of Ukraine's Russian-speaking
population as a justification for war and that the plans included a
video featuring fake corpses.]{.underline}** The video never
materialized; Russia has consistently claimed it was invading to protect
ethnic Russians from "Nazis\" in Ukraine.

**[The U.S. accurately predicted that Putin intended to go through with
the attack, even as other Western countries, notably France, argued
otherwise. The head of France's military intelligence agency stepped
down last week over the wrong call.]{.underline}**

**[A former U.S. official said administration officials believe the
strategy delayed Putin's invasion from the first week of January to
after the Olympics and that the delay bought the U.S. valuable time to
get allies on the same page in terms of the level of the Russian threat
and how to respond.]{.underline}**

**[CIA Director William Burns, a former ambassador to Russia, told
lawmakers at a congressional threats hearing last month that "in all the
years I spent as a career diplomat, I saw too many instances in which we
lost information wars with the Russians."]{.underline}**

**[Now, he said, "by being careful about this we have stripped away the
pretext that Putin, in particular, often uses."]{.underline}**

**["That has been a real benefit, I think, to Ukrainians," he
said.]{.underline}**

**[The policy has drawn lavish praise even from some
Republicans.]{.underline}**

**["You were spot on in your intelligence," Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick,
R-Pa., said at the House's annual worldwide threats hearing last month,
addressing Burns and other intelligence agency leaders. "Your decision
to declassify, both the form and the fashion in which you did so, saved
lives. Sleep well, and thank you for doing that."]{.underline}**

Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon. But, despite the highly valuable
and beneficial tools and services these platforms provide small
businesses, Sen]{.underline}**. Amy **[Klobuchar]{.underline}** (D-MN)
**[and]{.underline}** her **[colleagues supporting the American
Innovation and Choice Online Act]{.underline}** (AICOA /S.2992) **[don't
seem to hear small businesses' concerns]{.underline}**. Frankly, it's
getting ridiculous.

**[I have met with hundreds of small business leaders from across the
country, including many in Florida. I heard their fears during COVID-19
when lockdowns threatened businesses and livelihoods, and I hear their
frustrations today about inflation, supply chain issues, and
over-regulation. I've also heard their exhilaration about the
entrepreneurial opportunities of e-commerce and the benefits of
affordable marketing and digital advertising.]{.underline}**

I hear from the party rental company that barely made ends meet while
advertising in the Yellow Pages. Once they started advertising online,
their business grew 900% annually, could compete with big-box retailers
and national party rental companies, and withstood the uncertainties of
the pandemic.

I hear from the Iowa-based inventor of organic body and pet care
products. He knows that Amazon's marketplace launched his business to a
whole new level; and that he benefits tremendously when Amazon fulfills
his orders and guarantees product delivery in two days or less.

I hear from businesses across rural America that have embraced
e-commerce and now reach customers far beyond their small towns. Our
latest research documents that online web stores and marketplaces are
the leading sales methods for rural small sellers, compared to brick and
mortar and wholesale methods as the leading methods for all small
sellers. In fact, for rural sellers in Florida, the revenue they
generate from online marketplaces makes up 26 percent of their total
revenue, compared to 17.5 percent for small sellers generally.

**[Despite the clear benefits the digital ecosystem provides, some in
Congress seem to believe that if it isn't broke, it still needs
fixing]{.underline}**. **[Sen. Klobuchar recently said, "\[w\]hen
dominant tech companies exclude rivals & kill competition, it hurts
small businesses."]{.underline}** Lead sponsor of the House companion
bill (H.R.3816), Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI 01), said that the
legislation will "help ensure lower prices and greater choice for
consumers."

**[But consumers clearly choose to use free Google Maps and Instagram,
and small businesses love free Google Analytics and Google Trends. Small
sellers on the Amazon Marketplace use Fulfillment-by-Amazon (FBA)
because it is 30% cheaper than fulfilling orders on their own. In
reality, these bills would produce higher prices, a more complicated
digital ecosystem for small businesses, and more clutter for
consumers.]{.underline}**

It's no surprise that H.R.3816's co-sponsor, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO02),
recently admitted that he doesn't "know anything about antitrust law."
Perhaps that's the problem with these proposals. Sen. Klobuchar and her
colleagues are blinded by "big is bad" myopia and don't understand that
network effects are powerful and highly beneficial to small businesses
that can sell their products and services worldwide. **[The bill's
proponents are hellbent on restricting four companies' growth by forcing
them to break apart integrated services, increase costs, and hinder them
from continuing to innovate. It's no wonder that 9 out of 10 small
businesses worry that legislation and new regulations would make digital
tools and services more expensive and less valuable.]{.underline}**

**[In the modern global economy that small businesses operate in,
sometimes bigger is better. Large digital platforms invest billions of
dollars in R&D to bring small businesses powerful, affordable tools.
These companies have extraordinary scale that helps keep prices low for
consumers and continues to unlock opportunities for small businesses
that help them grow and thrive in their local
communities.]{.underline}**

**[Forcing tech companies to change how they operate and dis-integrate
products and services so subpar products and services can compete is
unfair to small business customers and devalues American ingenuity and
hard-earned success]{.underline}**. That policymakers cannot see, or
choose to ignore this, is truly unfortunate. **[If Congress rejects
these bills and focuses on issues that actually matter to small
businesses and the digital economy, they will actually help small
businesses instead of hurt them.]{.underline}**

#### Antitrust reform won't help small businesses -- they use Big Tech services, so their costs would rise

Krisztian **[Katona, vice president of global competition and regulatory
policy at the Computer & Communications Industry Association, however,
said that after performing a cost-benefit analysis of AICOA, he expects
the legislation will hurt business competition.]{.underline}**

**[He said that the legislation would increase operating costs for
smaller companies and force these companies to reduce the cost of their
services.]{.underline}** He predicts that close to 100 companies by 2030
would be negatively impacted by the legislation if it becomes law.

Others agree with Katona. **[A report in March by the Small Business and
Entrepreneurship Council said small business owners felt the AICOA could
be detrimental to them, saying it could increase prices.]{.underline}**
Meanwhile Michael **[Petricone, senior vice president of the Consumer
Technology Association, said in June that small businesses would be
affected the most by big tech regulation because they depend on those
platforms.]{.underline}**

### Antitrust Reform Bad -- Econ & Cyber

#### Antitrust reform would trigger regulatory shock -- increasing prices and uncertainty, reduce innovation AND weaken cybersecurity

**Wall Street Journal Editorial Board, 6-5-22**

\[Wall Street Journal Editorial Board, 6-5-22, Wall Street Journal,
"Breaking Big Tech Bad",
<https://www-wsj-com.umw.idm.oclc.org/articles/breaking-big-tech-bad-senate-judiciary-committee-bipartisan-antitrust-bill-facebook-meta-google-twitter-11654113174>,
accessed 7-16-22, AFB\]

**[When lawmakers and regulators move too fast, they break things. But
then breakage seems to be the main point of a bipartisan group of
Senators pushing legislation that would punish Big Tech companies. The
bill has received little debate,]{.underline}** yet Majority Leader
Chuck **[Schumer wants to hold a vote pronto.]{.underline}**

**[Giant businesses have always emerged during eras of technological
upheaval. But their dominance faded over time amid competition or
business mistakes---think of General Motors, Sears, Xerox, or IBM. Note
that Big Tech stocks have plunged this year in part owing to slower
growth and monetary tightening.]{.underline}**

The Senate Judiciary Committee in January voted 16-6 to advance the
deceptively named American Innovation and Choice Online Act. The bill
has six Republican co-sponsors. **[Some Republicans want to take a swing
at tech companies for censoring conservatives while posing as defenders
of small business.]{.underline}**

We've criticized Big Tech platforms as much as anyone for stifling
political debate. But states are experimenting with legislation to crack
down on censorship, and Elon Musk's bid to buy Twitter is a market
solution. **[While companies sometimes engage in anti-competitive
practices, competition regulators and courts are equipped to deal with
them under current law. The Senate bill will create more problems than
it solves.]{.underline}**

**[The bill empowers the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department
to restrict business practices of "covered platforms."]{.underline}**
The bill initially would capture Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Apple, Meta
(Facebook), Microsoft, Tencent ( WeChat ) and ByteDance (TikTok), though
it could eventually sweep in others, including Twitter and Walmart.

**[These platforms would be barred from giving "preference" to their own
products or services. Regulators will have broad discretion to decide
what that means. Is Amazon giving preference to its own distribution
service by providing free two-day shipping for its Prime members? Is
Apple favoring its Safari browser by pre-installing it on
iPhones?]{.underline}**

**[Tech companies would have to re-engineer their platforms to avoid
complaints from regulators and rivals. As a result, Amazon Prime
subscribers might also not be allowed to stream Amazon original movies
and TV shows for free or get free-two day shipping. A host of services
that benefit consumers could disappear based on bureaucratic
whim.]{.underline}**

Google's favoritism for its own products in search has understandably
rankled smaller rivals. But there's nothing that stops users from going
directly to sites like Yelp or Expedia, which can also sue Google for
abusing its search dominance to restrict competition.

**[The bill would also effectively require platforms to make their
products inter-operable with competitors. This would be technically
difficult, and in some cases impossible, and could make products less
functional. This would reduce cyber security as the U.S. is coming under
increasing attack from hackers, including state actors]{.underline}**.
**[Ensuring platforms are inter-operable could make it easier for cyber
thieves to pilfer user data.]{.underline}** Apple might have to allow
rival app stores and apps on iPhones no matter if they provide subpar
security protection.

**[The bill says its mandates don't apply if they would lead to
"significant cyber-security risk" but the onus would be on platforms to
prove that their features are necessary to protect security or privacy,
or "maintain or substantially enhance the core functionality" of their
platforms. In short, the platforms would be guilty of anti-competitive
conduct unless they prove their innocence.]{.underline}**

One irony is that Meta---the Facebook parent that politicians
abhor---could be least harmed by the bill's conduct prohibitions since
it boasts fewer integrated products. Facebook could benefit since it
might be able to develop a competing app store for iPhones. Apple could
be compelled to hand over user data to Facebook.

**[It's hard to predict how regulators would apply the bill's conduct
prohibitions and mandates. But there's no doubt the bill would create
enormous uncertainty that slows U.S. innovation.]{.underline}** This
would hit the U.S. tech industry even as Beijing is backing off its
antitrust assault on China's tech giants after discovering the damage it
has done to its economy.

Some Republican Senators who backed the bill in the Judiciary Committee
have long and rightly complained about an overweening administrative
state. **[Yet the bill would give antitrust regulators enormous
discretion to interpret vague provisions.]{.underline}** A Senate vote
will say a lot about the economic priorities of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz,
among others.

**[The U.S. economy is suffering from inflation, interest rates are
rising, and a recession is possible. The last thing America needs is a
new regulatory shock from Congress.]{.underline}**

### AT -- Economic Decline Causes War

#### Economic decline does not cause war

**Walt, Harvard international relations professor, 20**

\[Stephen M., 5-13-20, Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University, "Will a Global Depression
Trigger Another World War?", FOREIGN POLICY,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
accessed 7-15-22\]

On balance, however, **[I do not think that even the extraordinary
economic conditions]{.underline}** we are witnessing today **[are going
to have much impact on the likelihood of war.]{.underline}** Why? First
of all, **[if depressions were a powerful cause of war, there would be a
lot more of the latter.]{.underline}** To take one example, **[the
United States has suffered 40 or more recessions since the country was
founded, yet it has fought perhaps 20 interstate wars]{.underline}**,
most of them **[unrelated to the state of the economy.]{.underline}** To
paraphrase the economist Paul Samuelson's famous quip about the stock
market, if **[recessions were a powerful cause of war, they would have
predicted "nine out of the last five (or fewer)."]{.underline}**

Second, **[states do not start wars unless they believe they will win a
quick and relatively cheap victory.]{.underline}** As John
**[Mearsheimer showed]{.underline}** in his classic book Conventional
Deterrence, national **[leaders avoid war when they are convinced it
will be long, bloody, costly, and uncertain. To choose war, political
leaders have to convince themselves they can either win a quick, cheap,
and decisive victory or achieve some limited objective at low
cost.]{.underline}** Europe went to war in 1914 with each side believing
it would win a rapid and easy victory, and Nazi Germany developed the
strategy of blitzkrieg in order to subdue its foes as quickly and
cheaply as possible. Iraq attacked Iran in 1980 because Saddam believed
the Islamic Republic was in disarray and would be easy to defeat, and
George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003 convinced the war would be short,
successful, and pay for itself.

The fact that each of these leaders miscalculated badly does not alter
the main point: **[No matter what a country's economic condition might
be, its leaders will not go to war unless they think they can do so
quickly, cheaply, and with a reasonable probability of
success.]{.underline}**

Third, and most important, the **[primary motivation for most wars is
the desire for security, not economic gain.]{.underline}** For this
reason, the **[odds of war increase when states believe the long-term
balance of power may be shifting against them, when they are convinced
that adversaries are unalterably hostile and cannot be accommodated, and
when they are confident they can reverse the unfavorable trends and
establish a secure position]{.underline}** if they act now. The
historian A.J.P. Taylor once observed that **["every war between Great
Powers \[between 1848 and 1918\] ... started as a preventive war, not as
a war of conquest," and that remains true of most wars fought since
then.]{.underline}**

The bottom line: **[Economic conditions (i.e., a depression) may affect
the broader political environment in which decisions for war or peace
are made, but they are only one factor among many and rarely the most
significant. Even if]{.underline}** the **[COVID-19 pandemic has large,
lasting, and negative effects on the world economy]{.underline}**---as
seems quite likely---**[it is not likely to affect the probability of
war very much, especially in the short term.]{.underline}**

#### No war -- empirical research does not back up diversionary war theory 

**Segev et al., Tel Aviv University International Communication
professor, 21**

\[Elad & Atusushi Tago & Kohei Watanabe, Waseda University, 5-5-21,
International Interactions, "Could Leaders Deflect from Political
Scandals? Cross-National Experiments on Diversionary Action in Israel
and Japan\". TAYLOR & FRANCIS,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050629.2022.2044326>,
accessed 7-15-22\]

**[The diversionary theory of war is one of the best-known conflict
initiation theories focusing on democratic leaders' incentives.
According to the theory]{.underline}**, democratic
**[leaders]{.underline}** who face greater electoral challenges, either
**[due to political scandals or an economic downturn]{.underline}**, are
more likely to **[choose provocative foreign policies and seek to lead
the country into diplomatic crises, in hopes of inciting nationalistic
sentiments]{.underline}** that will boost their approval ratings via the
so-called "rally around the flag" effect (e.g. Gaines 2002; Hetherington
and Nelson 2003; Mueller 1973).

**[Despite the intuitive appeal of this theory,]{.underline}**
**[empirical studies have been largely unable to find consistent
evidence to corroborate the purported theoretical
mechanisms]{.underline}**. Findings from observational studies have been
quite mixed. The fact that a **[diverse]{.underline}** set of
**[findings]{.underline}** have been reported from observational studies
**[suggests that unobservable confounders arising from strategic
interactions greatly hinder our ability to tease out the causal
effect]{.underline}** of electoral hardship on conflict behaviors.

**[In this research note, we claim that the key assumption of the theory
does not work as expected. That is, a political leader cannot divert
attention]{.underline}** from his/her political scandals **[by
emphasizing a foreign threat and alerting the general public that the
country may go to war against an enemy. Although the assumptions that
the threat or use of force is salient and that an acute enemy threat
would create a rally-around-the-flag effect are common, they have rarely
been tested at a micro-level in an experimental setting. Our team
conducted a cross-national experiment to find out whether and how
political leaders could divert the public's attention away from their
political scandals]{.underline}**.

#### Domestic unrest won't spark war -- it just doesn't make sense

**Walt, Harvard international relations professor, 20**

\[Stephen M., 5-13-20, Robert and Renée Belfer professor of
international relations at Harvard University, "Will a Global Depression
Trigger Another World War?", FOREIGN POLICY,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/>,
accessed 7-15-22\]

For these reasons, the pandemic itself may be conducive to peace. But
**[what about the relationship between broader economic conditions and
the likelihood of war? Might a few leaders]{.underline}** still
**[convince themselves that provoking a crisis and going to war
could]{.underline}** still **[advance either long-term national
interests or their own political fortunes? Are the other paths by which
a deep and sustained economic downturn might make serious global
conflict more likely?]{.underline}**

**[One]{.underline}** familiar **[argument is]{.underline}** the
so-called **[diversionary]{.underline}** (or "scapegoat") theory of
**[war.]{.underline}** It suggests that leaders who are worried about
their popularity at home will try to divert attention from their
failures by provoking a crisis with a foreign power and maybe even using
force against it. Drawing on this logic, **[some]{.underline}**
Americans now **[worry that]{.underline}** President Donald **[Trump
will decide to attack a country like Iran or Venezuela in the run-up to
the presidential election and especially if he thinks he's likely to
lose.]{.underline}**

**[This outcome strikes me as unlikely, even if one ignores the logical
and empirical flaws in the theory itself. War is always a gamble, and
should things go badly---even a little bit---it would hammer the last
nail in the coffin]{.underline}** of Trump's declining fortunes.
Moreover, **[none of the countries Trump might consider going after pose
an imminent threat to U.S. security, and even his staunchest supporters
may wonder why he is wasting time and money going after Iran or
Venezuela at a moment when thousands of Americans are dying preventable
deaths]{.underline}** at home. Even a successful military action won't
put Americans back to work, create the sort of testing-and-tracing
regime that competent governments around the world have been able to
implement already, or hasten the development of a vaccine. The same
logic is likely to guide the decisions of other world leaders too.

**[Another]{.underline}** familiar folk **[theory is "military
Keynesianism."]{.underline}** War generates a lot of economic demand,
and it can sometimes lift depressed economies out of the doldrums and
back toward prosperity and full employment. The obvious case in point
here is World War II, which did help the U.S economy finally escape the
quicksand of the Great Depression. Those who are convinced that great
powers go to war primarily to keep Big Business (or the arms industry)
happy are naturally drawn to this sort of argument, and they might worry
that governments looking at bleak economic forecasts will try to restart
their economies through some sort of military adventure.

**[I doubt it. It takes a really big war to generate a significant
stimulus]{.underline}**, and **[it is hard to imagine any country
launching a large-scale war---with all its attendant risks---at a moment
when debt levels are already soaring]{.underline}**. More importantly,
**[there are lots of easier and more direct ways to stimulate the
economy---infrastructure spending, unemployment insurance, even
"helicopter payments"---and launching a war has to be one of the least
efficient methods available.]{.underline}** The **[threat of war usually
spooks investors too, which any politician with their eye on the stock
market would be loath to do.]{.underline}**

#### Economic collapse doesn't cause war

**Drezner, Tufts International Law professor, 14**

\[Daniel, January, professor of International Law at Tufts, The System
Worked: Global Economic Governance during the Great Recession, World
Politics, Volume 66. Number 1, JSTOR, accessed 7-15-22\]

The final significant outcome addresses **[a dog that hasn\'t barked:
the effect of the Great Recession on cross-border conflict and violence.
During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple analysts asserted that
the financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of
force]{.underline}** **[as a tool for staying in power]{.underline}**.42
**[They voiced genuine concern that the global economic downturn would
lead to an increase in conflict---whether through greater internal
repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up of great
power conflict]{.underline}**. Violence in the Middle East, border
disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy
movement fueled impressions of a surge in global public disorder.

**[The aggregate data suggest otherwise, however. The Institute for
Economics and Peace has concluded that \"the average level of
peacefulness in 2012 is approximately the same as it was in 2007.\"43
Interstate violence in particular has declined since the start of the
financial crisis, as have military expenditures in most sampled
countries. Other studies confirm that]{.underline}** **[the Great
Recession has not triggered any increase in violent
conflict]{.underline}**, as Lotta Themner and Peter Wallensteen
conclude: **[\"\[T\]he pattern is one of relative stability when we
consider the trend for the past five years]{.underline}**.\"44
**[The]{.underline}** secular **[decline in violence that started with
the end of the Cold War has not been reversed]{.underline}**. Rogers
Brubaker observes that \"**[the crisis has not]{.underline}** to date
**[generated the surge in protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion
that might have been expected]{.underline}**.\"45

### Economic Decline Now & Inevitable

#### Global growth will be weak and dropping for years due to the Ukraine war and COVID

**World Bank Press Release, 6-7-22**

\[ June 7, 2022, "Stagflation Risk Rises Amid Sharp Slowdown in Growth,"
PRESS RELEASE NO: 2022/068/EFI,

accessed 7-15-22\]

**[Compounding the damage from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russian
invasion of Ukraine has magnified the slowdown in the global economy,
which is entering what could become a protracted period of feeble growth
and elevated inflation]{.underline}**, according to the World Bank's
latest Global Economic Prospects report. **[This raises the risk of
stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and
low-income economies alike]{.underline}**.

**[Global growth is expected to slump from 5.7 percent in 2021 to 2.9
percent in 2022--- significantly lower than 4.1 percent that was
anticipated in January. It is expected to hover around that pace over
2023-24, as the war in Ukraine disrupts activity, investment, and trade
in the near term, pent-up demand fades, and fiscal and monetary policy
accommodation is withdrawn. As a result of the damage from the pandemic
and the war, the level of per capita income in developing economies this
year will be nearly 5 percent below its pre-pandemic
trend]{.underline}**.

"**[The war in Ukraine, lockdowns in China, supply-chain disruptions,
and the risk of stagflation are hammering growth. For many countries,
recession will be hard to avoid]{.underline}**," said World Bank
President David Malpass. "Markets look forward, so it is urgent to
encourage production and avoid trade restrictions. Changes in fiscal,
monetary, climate and debt policy are needed to counter capital
misallocation and inequality."

#### Global growth has cracks in the foundation which make prolonged downturn unavoidable -- also wrecks international coop

**El-Erian, Allianz chief economic adviser at Allianz, 5-16-22**

\[Mohamed, He served as chair of Barack Obama's Global Development
Council and is a former deputy director at the IMF, 5-16-22, THE
GUARDIAN, "Beware a global economy with little fires everywhere,"
<https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/beware-a-global-economy-with-little-fires-everywhere>,
accessed 7-15-22\]

**[Big shocks to the global economy, such as Russia's invasion of
Ukraine, understandably capture the most attention. But a new worldwide
pattern of "little fires everywhere" may be equally consequential for
longer-term economic wellbeing]{.underline}**. **[Over time, these small
fires can coalesce into one that is just as threatening as the initial
large fire that acted as the catalyst]{.underline}**.

In addition to causing widespread death and destruction, and displacing
millions of people, **[the Ukraine war continues to stoke strong
stagflationary winds throughout the global economy. The resulting damage
-- whether in the form of higher food and energy prices or new
supply-chain disruptions -- cannot be easily or rapidly countered by
domestic policy adjustments]{.underline}**.

**[For most countries, the war's immediate economic consequences include
higher inflation (which erodes purchasing power), lower growth,
increased inequality, and greater financial instability. The
multilateral system, meanwhile, now faces greater obstacles to the type
of cross-border policy coordination needed to deal with pressing global
problems such as climate change, pandemics, and life-threatening
migration]{.underline}**.

The challenges are particularly acute for fragile commodity importers in
the developing world, especially when compared with the problems facing
advanced economies. It is the difference between legitimate worries
about the cost-of-living crisis in the UK, for example, and fear of
famine in some African countries. The United States' higher trade and
budget deficits appear considerably less problematic than potential
defaults by heavily indebted low-income countries. And while the recent
decline in the yen's value may be attention-grabbing in a Japanese
context, a disorderly collapse of poorer countries' exchange rates could
fuel widespread financial instability.

As Michael Spence, the Nobel laureate economist and an expert on growth
and development dynamics, pointed out to me recently, **[the probability
of simultaneous growth, energy, food, and debt crises is worryingly high
for too many developing countries. If that nightmare scenario
materialises, the effects will be felt far beyond individual developing
countries -- and will extend well beyond economics and
finance]{.underline}**.

It is therefore in advanced economies' interest to help poorer countries
reduce the mounting risk of little economic fires everywhere.
Fortunately, there is a rich historical record, especially from the
1970s and 1980s, to draw on in this regard. Effective action today will
require policymakers to refine proven solutions and support their
sustained implementation with strong leadership, coordination, and
perseverance.

For starters, a preemptive multilateral debt-restructuring and relief
initiative is needed to provide essential space for overly indebted
countries and overstretched creditors to achieve orderly outcomes on a
case-by-case basis. A multilaterally-coordinated approach is also
crucial in order to reduce the disruptive -- and sometimes paralysing --
risk of free riders, and to ensure fair burden-sharing among official
creditors, as well as with private lenders.

Reinvigorating emergency commodity buffers and financing facilities is
critical in order to reduce the risk of food riots and famines. Such
measures can also play a useful role in countering some countries'
understandable but shortsighted inclination to ban agricultural exports
and/or engage in inefficient self-insurance through excessive
stockpiling.

Finally, rich-country governments will need to provide more official
development assistance to support individual countries' reform efforts.
This aid should be extended under highly concessional terms through
long-maturity, low-interest loans or outright grants.

Absent more rapid progress in these areas, **[the
little-fires-everywhere phenomenon will damage global economic wellbeing
by further weakening growth, increasing the risk of a recession, and
fuelling additional financial instability]{.underline}**. This would add
to current migration challenges, impede efforts to tackle the climate
crisis, and delay the worldwide vaccination drive that is key to living
more safely with Covid-19. Moreover, all these problems would promote
geopolitical instability at a time when the global system is already
subject to growing fragmentation pressures.

#### Social unrest is already tanking economies worldwide

**Barrett, IMF Research Department economist, 22**

\[Philip, 5-20-22, IMF Blog, "Social Unrest is Rising, Adding to Risks
for Global Economy,"
<https://blogs.imf.org/2022/05/20/social-unrest-is-rising-adding-to-risks-for-global-economy/>,
accessed 7-15-22, AFB\]

In coming months, two important **[factors could lead to an increased
risk of future unrest]{.underline}**. First, **[as governments relax
restrictions]{.underline}** and public concerns **[about]{.underline}**
catching **[COVID]{.underline}** in crowds diminish, **[pandemic-related
disincentives for protest might abate]{.underline}**. And second,
**[public frustration with rising food and fuel prices may
increase]{.underline}**. Although the economic causes of civil disorder
are complex, and unrest is exceptionally hard to predict, steep price
increases for food and fuel have been associated with more frequent
protests in the past.

**[Any rise in social unrest could pose a risk to the global economy's
recovery, as it can have a lasting impact on economic
performance]{.underline}**. In a paper last year, IMF staff showed that
unrest can have a negative economic impact as consumers become spooked
by uncertainty and output is lost in manufacturing and services. As a
result, 18 months after the most serious unrest events, gross domestic
product is typically about 1 percentage point lower than it would have
been otherwise.

Although social unrest remains low relative to pre-pandemic levels for
now, the lifting of pandemic-era restrictions and the continued
cost-of-living squeeze mean that **[protests may yet increase. This
could impose significant economic costs]{.underline}**.
