[What happens when an alliance's competitors quickly improve their
technology and capabilities to place the alliance at increased
risk]{.underline}? The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
addressed this dilemma during a recent summit in Brussels.  At the
summit, [the North Atlantic Council built upon[ NATO's 2030 strategic
outline](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/12/pdf/201201-Reflection-Group-Final-Report-Uni.pdf) and
presented targets for increased technological collaboration to counter
growing threats from Russia, China, and non-state actors. While NATO's
scientific and technical superiority has historically allowed it to
outpace competitors, its adversaries are quickly closing the
gap.]{.underline}

[NATO members still hold advantages in their development of [new
technologies](http://wavellroom.com/podcast/technology-and-the-future-of-land-warfare/)]{.underline}.
According to the Global Innovation Index, seven of the top ten[ most
innovative
countries](https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship/the-worlds-most-innovative-countries-2020-15076) globally
are part of NATO, while the other three are key NATO partners. [Even so,
NATO can do more to harness the alliance's combined technological
prowess to better compete and win in a future conflict. As China seeks
to become the[ world's innovation
leader](https://www.businesschief.asia/leadership-and-strategy/china-aims-be-global-innovation-leaders-next-15-years) and
Russia continues to undermine the alliance's security, NATO will need to
out-innovate its competitors and prepare for an uncertain
future.]{.underline}

[Four areas where NATO can focus on improving its competitive edge are
developing its formal organizations, increasing public and private
sector collaboration, harnessing and countering Emerging Disruptive
Technologies (EDTs),]{.underline} and improving conventional military
equipment. [NATO must maintain its relative lead in technology sectors
to defend its people and enhance its long-term strategic position.
Improving science and technology (S&T) innovation will increase alliance
collaboration, strengthen public and private sector cooperation, counter
hybrid threats, deter adversaries, and harden defenses against
attacks]{.underline}. [NATO's effectiveness in the future will heavily
depend on its ability to maintain and improve its science and technology
capabilities.]{.underline}

#### Cyber exercises key in establishing a resilient society in an age of cyber threats -- they build awareness and test responses

[During COVID 19-crisis the security and resilience of critical
information system have been more important than ever
before]{.underline}. Breaches and cyber security incidents impressively
highlighted the importance of cyber security and especially incident
response (ENISA, 2020). [[In order to ensure resilience of systems, and
to prepare for a such unpredictable cyber threats, it is necessary to
continuously train people how to purposefully react on these threats and
to communicate within the team under difficult
circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wilhemson and Svensson, 2014).
[Therefore, [exercises especially cyber exercises, play a central role
in establishing a resilient society.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Cyber exercises have gained a lot of attention throughout recent
years,]{.mark} especially in the cyber security sector, as an important
tool for security training, awareness-building and testing incident
response.]{.underline} The EU emphasizes the importance of this field in
its strategy for the digital decade (European Commission, 2020). [[Large
exercises]{.mark}, that make it to the news, such as
CyberStorm]{.underline} (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), ), [[Locked Shields]{.underline}]{.mark} (The NATO Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2021) [or Cyber Europe]{.underline}
(ENISA, 2021[), represent only a small fraction of the exercises carried
out. [Conducting cyber exercises also has an educational value]{.mark}.
Through interactive activities, such as simulations and scenarios,
exercise participants [apply knowledge in practical situations using
techniques and tools]{.mark} they are familiar with, thereby deepening
their understanding of a particular type of incident]{.underline}
(Dewar, 2018).

FUTURE: ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN CYBERSECURITY

As the Cyber Coalition demonstrates the actions taken by NATO, this
segment will further elaborate on more aspects that can be covered in
the aforementioned exercises. [The core of NATO cybersecurity efforts
lies at the member-state level.]{.underline}7 The size and severity of
today\'s cyber-attacks involve a new approach to political, military,
and civilian responses. [NATO should take a few effective steps in the
organisation to establish a quick decision-making mechanism while
confronting a cyber-attack. The solution towards more secure cyberspace
lies in the functioning and accountability of member states; currently,
no mechanism exists to ensure that the member states are adhering to the
Cyber Defence Pledge]{.underline} taken in the Warsaw Summit of 2016.
[NATO can discuss and provide expertise, however, there is no apparatus
to enforce that expertise on the member, and the efficiency of the cyber
defence efforts depend on the implementation by the
members]{.underline}.

[The first action can be taken concerning the decision making of NATO,
which is divided into NATO as an organisation and its
members.]{.underline} In the former aspect, [the resource allocation to
NATO should be increased as it will help in not only detecting and
indicating hostile cyber activities but will allow better use of the
civil and military intelligence units]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[the
powers of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe should be increased by the
North Atlantic Council, along with which the CCDCoE should increase
cyber defence activities and exercises as it will increase
efficiency]{.underline}**. [The focus of these exercises should be on
dynamic and challenging cyber crisis-conflict situations, fast
decision-making processes.]{.underline} [Concerning the members' role,
identifying and sharing information about any potential threats to any
of the members should be shared; the national intelligence services
should supply and exchange such information. Allies and willing partners
should continue to work on improving and updating threat
assessments]{.underline}, and facilitating closer intelligence
cooperation.8 Cyber challenges arrive in the form of networks and to
defeat these threats involves an equally well-organized network of
multinational and cross-sector collaboration. CC20 did deal with the
aspect of decision making, however, as explained above, this aspect has
a greater potential to secure the member states of NATO from the cyber
threats.

\*GPS = Global Positioning System

[Space-based infrastructure is a critical infrastructure for security
and the economy]{.underline} --- in fact, [it is critical
to]{.underline} [most aspects of]{.underline} [modern life]{.underline}
--- [and therefore]{.underline} is [a prime target for malicious
attacks]{.underline} (Falco 2019). The [most significant]{.underline}
current security threat to space-based infrastructure and applications
[is]{.underline} from [cyberattacks]{.underline}. [Only a handful of
countries have]{.underline} the [capabilities to physically]{.underline}
[destroy satellites]{.underline} (Weeden and Samson 2022) ---
[and]{.underline} they [are likely to be exposed as]{.underline} the
[perpetrators]{.underline}. In contrast, executing a cyberattack
requires much less in terms of funds and technological and engineering
capabilities. Moreover, the attacker can attempt to cover its tracks,
leaving the attacked country uncertain about attribution and its own
response. Therefore, [cyberattacks are likely to become the leading
method of targeting space-based infrastructure for state actors, as well
as non-state]{.underline} [actors]{.underline}, notably criminal
organizations and terrorist groups. [There is evidence that such attacks
have already occurred]{.underline}: [Russia]{.underline} allegedly
[disrupted]{.underline} Global Positioning System ([GPS]{.underline})
[signals]{.underline} [during]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty
Organization [exercises in Finland]{.underline}, [Sweden]{.underline}
[and Norway in 2018]{.underline} (Harrison et al. 2020), affecting,
inter alia, the ability of commercial aircrafts to navigate;
[Turla]{.underline}, a Russian criminal gang, allegedly
[hijacked]{.underline} [satellite IP]{.underline} (Internet Protocol)
[addresses]{.underline} (Zetter 2015), which it later used to steal
data; [and]{.underline} [Hamas of Gaza]{.underline}, a terrorist
organization, [hacked]{.underline} the [satellite broadcast]{.underline}
of a major Israeli television channel (Leyden 2014). [A]{.underline}
cyberattack targeting space assets, or [space-cyberattack]{.underline},
[can jam GPS signals]{.underline}, [disabling navigation]{.underline},
[or spoof GPS signals]{.underline}, [providing misleading
locations]{.underline}, [in]{.underline} [both cases disrupting travel
and guided weapons systems]{.underline}. [A space-cyberattack
can]{.underline} "[blind]{.underline}" [remote sensing satellites that
provide satellite imagery and other data collected by various
sensors]{.underline}. [It can interrupt]{.underline} [communication
satellites services]{.underline}, including television, radio and
internet. Moreover, [it can disrupt banking and payment
systems]{.underline}, including the use of credit cards and automated
banking machines, which rely on satellite-based precise timing. Indeed,
[important segments of]{.underline} the [global financial system depend
on GPS]{.underline} (Fernholz 2017). Further, a [space-cyberattack
can]{.underline} [do more than render a satellite defunct]{.underline}:
[it can turn it into a weapon]{.underline}, for example, by taking
control of it and altering its course so that it crashes into another
satellite. Indeed, the [combined space-cyber warfare theatre will
be]{.underline} the [primary battlefield for global powers
in]{.underline} the [twenty-first century]{.underline} (Boucher 2013).
Accordingly, a report published by Harvard's Belfer Center for Science
and International Affairs suggested that the first mission of the new US
Space Force should be to ensure cybersecurity of space assets (Falco
2018). In a signal on the future of warfare, the head of the US
Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral John Aquilino, recently noted, "We've come
a long way in a short time to be able to integrate the space and cyber
domains" (quoted in Sevastopulo 2022).

[Cyber research is a fast-moving and constantly evolving area of
science, and the scope of cyberthreats that countries face is on the
rise as malicious actors find new ways to infiltrate weapons
systems.]{.underline} The use of electronic warfare methods and
cyberattacks in peacetime illustrates the blurred lines of engagement
between nations even in the absence of conflict. According to Norwegian
military and NATO officials, Russia persistently jammed civilian GPS
signals during NATO's 2018 Trident Juncture exercise in Europe's High
North region, which highlights the growing threat. In November 2018,
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated that electronic warfare
and cyberattacks were increasingly being used in operations.14 It was
also reported that NATO officials believed Russia is testing this
capability through its large-scale exercises, such as Zapad 2017, which
was conducted jointly with Belarus in September 2017.15 According to the
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), the most common
cyberthreats to the space segment, ground segment and space-link
communication segment include data corruption/modification; ground
system loss; interception of data; jamming; denial of service;
masquerade (spoofing); replay; software threats; and unauthorized
access.16 There is also crossover between offensive and defensive
activities in cyberspace and space, given that -- technologically --
offence is easier and more cost-effective than defence.17 Furthermore,
space-related personnel are vulnerable to cyberthreats. Social
engineering is becoming an important tool when used by adversaries, and
-- whether it occurs deliberately or unwittingly -- the potential for
people to constitute the weakest link in cyber defence is an increasing
reality.18 [The nature of cyber activities must evolve from being purely
defensive to include active, persistent engagement, in order to disrupt
attackers of western critical space-based capabilities.]{.underline}
Given the importance of space-based systems to critical infrastructure
that supports NATO military capabilities, it would be prudent to assume
that an adversary is already active in these networks and focus on
resilience measures. [This increases urgency for advanced techniques,
such as AI and machine learning (ML),19 to identify and respond to
modern threats.]{.underline} [Both China and Russia prioritize
electronic warfare, cyberattacks and superiority within the
electromagnetic battlespace as part of a strategy to achieve victory in
future operations.]{.underline} Available doctrine from these nations
highlights a key focus on preventing adversarial satellite-based
communication systems from impacting their operational effectiveness20
-- a focus shared in US military planning and policy.21 [Russian space
capabilities and their cybertechnologies pose particular threats to
NATO.]{.underline} For its navigational system, Russia relies on its own
satellite system GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System), rather
than the US-provided GPS or the EU's Galileo system. As part of a series
of improvements to its communications technology and GLONASS, Russia is
designing new navigation satellites, which are claimed to be highly
accurate and longer lasting.22 [Russia has been testing its capabilities
in a hybrid context in Syria and in Ukraine]{.underline}, particularly
relying on capabilities for jamming GPS signals to ground remotely
piloted aircraft. [It is reported to have conducted denial-of-service
attacks on radio and telephone equipment, and to have attempted to steal
encrypted military data.]{.underline}23

#### Cyber vulnerability of NATO space assets risks crushing NATO's military capabilities and deterrence -- only fostering cooperation on cyber security can solve deterrence 

**Lumiste 19** \[Liina, International Law Researcher for the NATO
Comparative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, "Chatham House report:
Space -- NATO cyber security's weak spot,"
<https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/chatham-house-report-space-nato-cyber-securitys-weak-spot/>,
accessed 07/04/22, GDI-JCR\]

In 2018, Norwegian military and allied officials confirmed that Russia
had disrupted NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in Europe's High North
region by persistently jamming GPS signals during the exercise. China
has claimed 'the ability to use space-based systems and to deny them to
adversaries as central to modern warfare'. As [the dependence of
military operations on space-based assets has increased exponentially
over the last few decades and space-based assets are potential targets
for cyber attack]{.underline}, the newly released Chatham House research
paper 'Cybersecurity of NATO's Space-based Strategic Assets' suggests
that [NATO should bring space more to the spotlight]{.underline}. The
research paper lists cyber threats to space-based strategic assets and
capabilities, analyses capability requirements and gives concrete
recommendations for ways improve the resilience of the space-based
systems. Space-based assets as targets for cyber attacks [Strategic
military systems depend on space-based assets for the provision of data
and for many capabilities, such as positioning, navigation and timing
(PNT), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), missile
defence, communications, space situational awareness (SSA) as well as
environmental monitoring]{.underline}. For accurate timing and
navigation in PNT systems, NATO uses the global positioning system (GPS)
which is also well known and widespread in civil use. ISR information
and imagery is collected through surveillance and reconnaissance
sensors. Both systems are satellite-based. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
systems also rely on satellite-based 'beyond-line-of-sight'
communication. These are only a few of the possible examples. In
addition to the abundance of capabilities, it is noteworthy that [the
capabilities are also linked and therefore affecting one capability may
cause collateral effects on others.]{.underline} As explained in the
Space Threat Assessment 2018 published by the Centre for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), there are several intrusion points for
space-based assets: antennas on satellites and ground stations,
landlines that connect ground stations to terrestrial networks, and user
terminals that connect to satellites. This can result in data or data
traffic monitoring, inserting false or corrupted data in the system, or
even the permanent loss of a satellite. As with every other technology,
people have the potential to be the weakest link in the cyber defence of
space-based assets -- social engineering is an important tool for the
adversary. Vulnerabilities The research paper highlights some of the
most important vulnerabilities: use of commercial companies;
'back-doors'; dual use of satellites; and supply chain security of space
technology. Chatham House reports have touched on these topics before.
The question of supply chain was raised in the Livingstone and Lewis
2016 report, which observed that there was no coherent global
organisation with regard to cyber security in space and that existing
approaches had only limited reach into the supply chain. In this year's
research paper, it is again stressed that when the supply chain does not
ensure that military security standards are met, items procured may
expose NATO systems to vulnerabilities. [NATO by itself does not own
satellites, but is dependent on member states.]{.underline} In case of
need, NATO requests access to products and services from the allies.
[NATO allies procure equipment and software, which will be integrated
into their national defence infrastructure.]{.underline} In most cases,
military and commercial assets are not separate. Therefore,
[NATO]{.underline} does not rely only on military assets, but [also uses
commercial, civilian and national or multinational assets for
operations.]{.underline} Even though commercial methods have proven to
be effective, they are accompanied by the inherent risk of lower
security requirements. Data exchange between civil and military sectors
may cause extra vulnerabilities. As most of the space-based capabilities
are dual-use, meaning that assets are used both for military and
civilian purposes, the Chatham House research paper recommends that
operators 'apply higher-grade military hardening and cyber protection
specifications to civilian capabilities that have the potential to be
used in support of military applications'. The research paper also
highlights the aspect of NATO's dependency on member states for
communication capacity as a possible source of vulnerabilities.
[NATO]{.underline} owns satellite communications (SATCOM) ground
stations, but no satellites; it [is therefore highly reliant on allies
to provide space-sourced data, information and services.]{.underline} In
addition, [ensuring the security of space capabilities is mostly in the
hands of the allies. **This puts NATO into a position where its main
option to protect capabilities of vital importance is to encourage
allies to put effort into securing the space-based assets and foster
cooperation in space-based systems cyber security.**]{.underline} Space
as a domain of operations? During the Brussels Summit in 2018, the
Alliance recognised space as a 'highly dynamic and rapidly evolving
area, which is essential to a coherent Alliance deterrence and defence
posture' and on 27 June 2019, it approved new space policy. As claimed
by NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, the space policy gives
guidance on opportunities and challenges and is not about militarising
space, but about information sharing and increasing interoperability.
The research paper suggests that, in addition to policy, NATO needs to
agree upon space doctrine. While policy directs, assigns tasks and
prescribes desired capabilities, doctrine provides principles of how
operations should be planned, prepared, commanded, conducted, sustained,
terminated and assessed.1 This suggestion becomes even more relevant
when taking into consideration recent announcements by some NATO
diplomats about NATO's aims to recognise space as a domain of warfare
during the London summit at the end of 2019. This indeed would be a big
step towards focusing more on space-based assets and their
vulnerabilities. [Considering the current context, in which China and
Russia are increasing their]{.underline} presence in space, this action
by NATO is inevitable. Whether or not NATO claims space as a domain,
adversaries will nevertheless develop their [aggressive
capabilities]{.underline}, from cyber operations to anti-satellite
missiles. Therefore, [it is prudent to update the approach towards space
and space-based assets to face new challenges.]{.underline} Yet,
claiming space to be a domain of warfare highlights legal
considerations. The Chatham House research paper raises a question from
the cyber perspective: whether a cyber attack on a space system has to
have kinetic consequences in order to give grounds for collective
self-defence according to the Washington Treaty. This can be
supplemented with a question on whether causing kinetic consequences
that result in debris breaches the responsibility not to cause
widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment, as
stipulated in article 35 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva
Conventions of 12 August 1949.2 Another question raised is targeting
dual-use space technology in international humanitarian law (IHL). The
principle of distinction foresees the duty to distinguish between the
civilian population and combatants and between civil and military
objects. As in the case of cyber objectives,3 dual-use satellites should
be counted as military objectives, but would be subject to the rule of
proportionality and requirement to take precautions in attack.4
Conclusion The Chatham House research paper makes recommendations that
more or less all stress the same things: **[NATO is highly dependent on
space capabilities; space-based systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks
and will become more and more appetising targets for adversaries; and
NATO must foster cooperation and information sharing between member
states.]{.underline}** [Overlooking these aspects could undermine the
credibility of the information provided through the space-based systems,
**which would in turn affect deterrence and strategic
liability**.]{.underline} In the broader view, [destabilising
space-based assets would not only affect military conduct, but also have
severe effects on civil infrastructures.]{.underline}

#### Specifically, Risk of cyber escalation in space with Russia is massive and goes nuclear -- prioritize this impact because cognitive bias underestimates it

Today, that old dread of disaster has all but disappeared, as have the
systems that helped preclude it. But [[the]{.mark} actual [threat of
nuclear catastrophe is much greater than we
realize.]{.mark}]{.underline} Diplomacy and a desire for global peace
have given way to complacency and a false sense of security that nuclear
escalation is outside the realm of possibility. [That leaves us
unprepared for---and highly vulnerable to---a nuclear attack from
Russia.]{.underline} The most recent sign of American complacency was
the death, a few weeks ago, of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty---a pivotal 1987 agreement that introduced intrusive on-site
inspection provisions, destroyed an entire class of dangerous weaponry,
and convinced both Washington and Moscow that the other wanted strategic
stability more than strategic advantage. The New START treaty, put in
place during the Obama administration, appears headed for a similar fate
in 2021. In fact, [nearly [all the key U.S.-Russian arms control and
confidence-building provisions of the Cold War era are dead or on life
support]{.mark}]{.underline}, with little effort underway to update or
replace them. Meanwhile, [U.S. officials from both parties are focused
not on how we might avoid nuclear catastrophe but on showing how tough
they can look]{.underline} against a revanchist Russia and its leader,
Vladimir Putin. Summit meetings between White House and Kremlin leaders,
once viewed as opportunities for peace, are now seen as dangerous
temptations to indulge in Munich-style appeasement, the cardinal sin of
statecraft. [American policymakers worry more about "going
wobbly,"]{.underline} as Margaret Thatcher once put it, [than about a
march of folly into inadvertent war.]{.underline} President Donald
Trump's suggestion that the United States and Russia might explore ways
to manage their differences diplomatically has produced mostly
head-scratching and condemnation. In my more than 25 years of government
experience working on Russia matters, I've seen that three misguided
assumptions underlie how the United States got to this point. The first
is that [American [policymakers think that because neither side wants
nuclear war, then]{.mark} such a [war is]{.mark} very [unlikely]{.mark}
to occur.]{.underline} Russia would be foolish, we reason, to cross
swords with the powerful U.S. military and risk its own
self-destruction, and many [[Americans find it hard to imagine
that]{.mark} modern [cyber duels]{.mark}, proxy battles, information
operations and economic warfare [might]{.mark} somehow [erupt into
direct nuclear attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline} If the Cold War ended
peacefully, the thinking goes, why should America worry that a new
shadow war with a much less formidable Russia will end any differently?
[But wars do not always begin by design. Just as they did in 1914, [a
vicious circle of clashing]{.mark} geopolitical [ambitions, distorted
perceptions]{.mark} of each other's intent, new and poorly understood
technologies, [and disappearing rules]{.mark} of the game [could combine
to produce a disaster]{.mark} that neither side wants nor
expects.]{.underline} In fact, **[[cyber
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, artificial intelligence, advanced
hypersonic weapons delivery systems and antisatellite weaponry [**[are
making the U.S.-Russian shadow war]{.mark} much [more]{.mark} complex
and [dangerous than the]{.mark} old [Cold War]{.mark} competition. [They
are blurring]{.mark} traditional [lines between espionage and warfare,
entangling nuclear and conventional weaponry, and erasing old
distinctions between offensive and defensive operations.]{.mark}**
Whereas the development of nuclear weaponry]{.underline} in the Cold War
[produced the concept of mutually assured destruction and had a
restraining effect, in the cyber arena, playing offense is increasingly
seen as the best defense. And in a highly connected world in which
financial networks, commercial operations, media platforms, and nuclear
command and control systems are all linked in some way, [escalation from
the cyber world into the physical domain is a serious danger. Cyber
tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} also [magnifying fears of]{.mark} our
[adversaries']{.mark} strategic [intentions while prompting questions
about]{.mark} whether warning systems can detect incoming attacks and
[whether weapons will fire when]{.mark} buttons are [pushed. This makes
containing a crisis]{.mark} that might arise between U.S. and Russian
forces over Ukraine, Iran or anything else [much more difficult. It is
not hard to imagine a crisis scenario]{.mark} in which [Russia cyber
operators gain access to a satellite system that controls]{.mark} both
[U.S.]{.mark} conventional and [nuclear weapons
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, leaving the American side uncertain about
whether the intrusion is meant to gather information about U.S. war
preparations or to disable our ability to conduct nuclear strikes.
[[This could cause the U.S.]{.mark} president [to]{.mark} wonder whether
he [face]{.mark}s [**an urgent "use** it or lose it" nuclear]{.mark}
launch [decision.]{.mark}]{.underline} It doesn't help that the lines of
communication between the United States and Russia necessary for
managing such situations are all but severed.

#### And, Attack on the Global Navigation Satellite System ripples across sectors, sparks panic

The Global Positioning System was originally designed as a military
system, to meet tactical and strategic needs on the battlefield, during
the Cold War Era. The term traditionally refers to the North American
global positioning system, or satellite positioning system, while GNSS
refers to the International Multi-Constellation Satellite System.
Therefore, [GNSS as an umbrella term typically includes GPS, GLONASS,
Baidu, Galileo, and any other constellation system.]{.underline} GNSS
and GPS work together, however the GNSScompatible equipment can use
navigational satellites from other networks beyond the GPS system, which
is the main difference from GPS, and more satellites means increased
receiver accuracy and reliability. [The GNSS can be targeted by
cyberattacks]{.underline} via the command connection or ground station,
since an unencrypted command link can expose the satellite\'s
capabilities to an opponent, or a ground station could be hacked
directly, allowing the ground station to influence satellite control or
data. The ITU, while recognizing that "Member States retain their entire
freedom with regard to military radio installations" \[44\] these
installations must, so far as possible, take measures to prevent harmful
interference \[45\]. Therefore, when assessing the interference risks
associated with conflict zones or planning military exercises, ITU
invites Member States to consider that the use of satellite-based
systems can potentially be impacted beyond that zone, and therefore, an
enhanced civilmilitary coordination is required. NATO's ballistic
missile defence capability is being built around a command-and-control
system that enables five key functions: planning, monitoring,
informationsharing, interception and consequence management 12 . The
security of the system relies on three key elements, confidentiality,
integrity and availability. industrial security is paramount (inc also
supply chains)" \[2\]. [The consequences of cyber-attacks on space
missions are aggravated because of component satellites' augmented
connectivity and use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in contemporary
space systems. The potential impacts of an attack on a communication
satellite can endanger national security by generating widespread
disruptions to communication channels, not only national level, but also
across widespread geographies, cross countries, and cause
panic.]{.underline} The attacker can infiltrate the network without
being detected and remain undetected. Cyber threats may target different
components of a space mission: the ground segment, the space segment,
and the link segment. The vulnerabilities stem from the ground segments;
mostly generated from network components and the receivers (which
receive the data from the satellite). The threats may also target
hardware of satellites in the supply chain, and compromise ground units
at a later stage \[46\]. "[Cyber vulnerabilities undermine confidence in
the performance of strategic systems. As a result, rising uncertainty in
information and analysis continues to impact the credibility of
deterrence and strategic stability]{.underline}. Loss of trust in
technology also has implications for determining the source of a
malicious attack (attribution), strategic calculus in crisis
decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception" \[47\]
Ground stations - how can we prevent threats? Preventive method and
time-based method. Previous attack on ISS. [GNSS are specifically
vulnerable to hostile cyber operations because of the very low power of
their signals and services and constitute potential primary targets in
future wars because of their importance not only for military
operations, but also for critical national infrastructure and key
economic sectors.]{.underline} Unlike physical attacks they are not
likely to cause major damages to the satellite navigation system. Recent
cyber operations against GNSS were jamming and spoofing \[48\] although
other types of attacks such as hacking or eavesdropping of
communications satellite systems, are also technically possible.

#### Disruption of the GNSS system would instantly destroy the global economy and gut virtually every critical infrastructure sector

For decades, America's satellites had circled Earth at a largely safe
remove from the vicissitudes of geopolitics. An informal global
moratorium on the testing of anti-satellite weapons had held since 1985;
the intervening decades had been a period of post--Cold War peace---and
unquestioned American supremacy---high overhead. During those decades,
[satellites had become linchpins of the American military apparatus and
the global economy.]{.underline} By 2007, ships at sea and warplanes in
the air had grown reliant on instant satellite communications with
ground stations thousands of miles away. Government forecasters relied
on weather satellites; intelligence analysts relied on high-­resolution
imagery to anticipate and track adversaries the world over. [**GPS had
become perhaps the single most indispensable global system ever designed
by humans---the infrastructure upon which the rest of the world's
infrastructure is based.** (Fourteen of the 16 infrastructure sectors
designated as critical by the Department of Homeland Security, like
energy and financial services, rely on GPS for their
operation.)]{.underline} Now, Shelton feared, all those satellites
overhead had become so many huge, unarmored, billion-dollar sitting
ducks. In the decade since China's first successful anti-satellite
missile test, Shelton's premonition has largely come true: Everything
has changed in space. A secretive, pitched arms race has opened up
between the US, China, Russia, and, to a lesser extent, North Korea. The
object of the race: to devise more and better ways to quickly cripple
your adversary's satellites. After decades of uncontested US supremacy,
multinational cooperation, and a diplomatic consensus on reserving space
for peaceful uses, military officials have begun referring to Earth's
orbit as a new "warfighting domain." On the ground, the military is
starting to retrain pilots, ship captains, and ground troops in
fail-safe forms of navigation that don't rely on GPS---like celestial
navigation. The US military must relearn how to fight "unwired" and
defend itself in space. "We knew how to do that, and somehow we forgot,"
General John E. Hyten, the head of US Strategic Command, said in 2015.
When former director of national intelligence James Clapper left office
at the end of the Obama administration, he told me that the increasing
sophistication of America's adversaries in space was one of the top
three strategic threats he worried about. Clapper's successor, Dan
Coats, warned last spring that "Russia and China remain committed to
developing capabilities to challenge perceived adversaries in space,
especially the United States." Since he took office, President Trump has
dropped numerous hints of the warnings he's evidently getting from
military and intelligence leaders. During a spring livestream with
astronauts aboard the International Space Station, he alluded, obliquely
and without context, to the "tremendous military applications in space."
And he has repeatedly floated the idea of creating a new branch of the
armed forces specifically for celestial combat---culminating last week
with a speech out-and-out ordering the Joint Chiefs of Staff to begin
developing plans for a new "Space Force." But if space is indeed
becoming a war-­fighting domain, it's important to understand the stakes,
not just for America's strategic standing but for the species. [**A
Russo-Sino-American space war could very well end with** a ~~crippled~~
\[wrecked\] **global economy, inoperable infrastructure, and a planet
shrouded by the orbiting fragments** of pulverized satellites---**which,
by the way, could hinder us all on Earth**]{.underline} until we figured
out a way of cleaning them up. In the aftermath of such a conflict, it
might be years before we could restore new constellations of satellites
to orbit. [Preparing for orbital war has fast become a priority of the
US military, but the more urgent priority is figuring out how to prevent
it.]{.underline} GROWING UP IN Oklahoma City, William Shelton dreamed of
becoming a pilot. He got as far as the Air Force Academy before he
discovered his eyes weren't good enough. So instead he became an
astronomical engineer. In 1976 he began serving as a launch facility
manager at Vandenberg Air Force Base, the military's oldest space and
missile launch base, perched on the California coast north of Santa
Barbara. He arrived just as the Air Force was beginning to understand
how crucial space would be to its future: The nation's first
early-warning satellites had been put in orbit with the intention of
tracking Soviet missile launches, and satellite imagery was becoming
increasingly critical to intelligence gathering. Shelton's poor
eyesight, it turned out, had led him to the center of the Air Force's
new frontier. In August 1990, Shelton, then a young lieutenant colonel,
took command of the 2nd Space Operations Squadron in Colorado. When he
arrived at his post, the Air Force was busy building a new constellation
of satellites---launching new ones from Cape Canaveral in Florida every
few months to help fill out what he was told would ultimately be a
global system aimed at helping the US improve its navigation and
increase the precision of its bombs and missiles. This was the new
Global Positioning System, and one of Shelton's first duties at "2Sops"
was to build support and enthusiasm for the new effort. To impress
visitors (including the brass), he carried around a demo GPS unit that
weighed 10 pounds, cost \$3,000, and could tell America's soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and Marines exactly where they were on the surface of
the planet. The power of the new system that 2Sops ran was proven faster
than anyone imagined. The Gulf War caused a rush of final preparations
to get GPS ready for battle. Around 2:30 am on January 17, 1991,
GPS-equipped helicopters snuck into Iraq, using the technology to guide
themselves through the darkened desert and knock out air defense radars.
The first bombing campaign of the war had begun. Reporters marveled at
precision-­guided bombs zeroing in on their targets and cruise missiles
appearing to turn street corners to hit the right buildings. Shelton had
a front-row seat to this transformation. As the technology has improved,
so has the precision of GPS. The system originally provided accuracy to
within 17 yards; with it, you could pinpoint a specific copse of pine
trees. Today, if you're using a smartphone, it can generally locate an
object to within five yards---a resolution fine enough to locate a pair
of pine trees within that copse. Soon it could be able to zero in on a
pine cone: Research from UC Riverside has demonstrated that the latest
tech is reliable to within an inch. And research has shown that
1-millimeter accuracy might be eventually possible---which means that
the system could locate an individual seed inside that pine cone. Today,
troops on the ground use GPS to navigate foreign streets; drone pilots
can program a flight plan from thousands of miles away. And because GPS
satellites also house America's detection system for nuclear
detonations, we rely on them to tell us if North Korea launches a
nuclear weapon, and to tell our missiles and bombs where to find their
targets. "When you look at our American way of war, the strategy is
largely underpinned by space assets---navigation, early warning,
timing," Shelton says. And that's just the military. The creators of GPS
probably never intended for the system to become the backbone of daily
life, but it has. I visited Colorado while reporting this story and
tried to keep tabs on everything I did that relied on GPS. There were
the obvious navigational moments---my Uber ride to the airport, my
American Airlines flight to Denver, my own Google Maps--guided drive in
a rental car to Schriever Air Force Base, outside Colorado Springs. But
there were also less obvious instances, like the phone calls I made
along the way (cellular networks rely on GPS data to keep their stations
synchronized), my stop at the ATM (banks use GPS to track deposits and
withdrawals), and the fill-up at the gas station (the credit card system
also relies on GPS). Moreover, GPS is no longer the world's sole
geolocating mechanism. Russia, China, and the European Union have now
all either deployed or begun working on their own full constellations of
navigation satellites, ensuring that they won't have to rely on the US
system. It also means that, in the early moments of a war, it's a fair
bet that satellites---the other guy's satellites---could be among the
first targets. DURING THE COLD War, a US army mountain outpost in the
Fulda Gap, the shortest route between East and West Germany, served as
an early warning trip wire for a Soviet invasion of Europe. If Russian
tanks ever made a surprise attack, NATO planners knew that the soldiers
there would likely be the first to find out. Today, the members of 2Sops
play a similar role. Deep inside the squat, beige, windowless Building
400 at Schriever Air Force Base---the destination I had plugged into
Google Maps during my trip to Colorado---10 people at a time remotely
operate the heavenly constellation of GPS satellites that guide Tomahawk
cruise missiles to their targets, deliver Lyft passengers to their
destinations, and help farmers cultivate their crops. They also watch
out for any shocks or attacks on the system. The average GPS operators
are in their mid-twenties. During one recent shift, the entire Global
Positioning System was being operated by two 19-year-old airmen (who,
the Air Force emphasizes, are rigorously trained). Their commander, US
Air Force lieutenant colonel Peter Norsky, is in his mid-thirties.
Together, they watch over the roughly three dozen GPS satellites,
troubleshooting the geolocation system and minding the quirks of each
orbiting craft---this one's damaged solar panels, that one's balky
communications links---as if they were remotely tending a stable full of
temperamental horses. As integral as GPS is to daily life, the way it
actually works is little understood by most people outside of Schriever
Air Force Base. [Fundamentally, the function of GPS is to provide the
globe with a shared clock. GPS satellites allow phone companies to keep
their systems in sync, battleships to chart open waters, and ATMs to
time-stamp their transactions]{.underline} by triangulating signals from
overhead and measuring how long it takes those signals from different
satellites to reach a GPS receiver. The system works by making daily
calculations, employing Newtonian physics and Einsteinian relativity, to
minutely tweak the time broadcast from each GPS satellite as it moves
through space---the high-tech version of tuning your grandfather clock
to within 100-­billionths of a second. Time is, after all, relative; as
of January, the time in space was 18 seconds ahead of Earth's
"Coordinated Universal Time," since space doesn't recognize the leap
seconds that scientists add to terrestrial time to account for the
planet's slowing rotation. Additionally, the time-keeping device on each
satellite gives a subtly different reading, the result of variations in
their atomic clocks, which tell time by measuring the precise
oscillations of an atom. (Some GPS satellites use rubidium atoms, which
are highly accurate day to day; some use cesium, which is more accurate
over long stretches.) **[Any malfunction in the GPS system threatens to
plunge the global economy into chaos.]{.underline}** Fortunately those
glitches are rare, but they're not unheard of. **[On January 25,
2016]{.underline}**, one of 2Sops' flight commanders, Captain Aaron
Blain, was awoken by a call from work in the middle of the night. User
reports from around the country suggested that **[the
system]{.underline}**'s precision had "wobbled," making measurements
increasingly inaccurate. Blain raced to Schriever in his Ford pickup and
found that the constellation's timing [**was off by about 13
microseconds.** It was an infinitesimal number---over 25,000 times
shorter than the blink of an eye---but for the finely tuned GPS it was a
yawning crevice. **Left uncorrected, the glitch could have ricocheted
through the global economy, corrupting not just driving directions but
stock trades too.**]{.underline}

[During COVID 19-crisis the security and resilience of critical
information system have been more important than ever
before]{.underline}. Breaches and cyber security incidents impressively
highlighted the importance of cyber security and especially incident
response (ENISA, 2020). [[In order to ensure resilience of systems, and
to prepare for a such unpredictable cyber threats, it is necessary to
continuously train people how to purposefully react on these threats and
to communicate within the team under difficult
circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} (Wilhemson and Svensson, 2014).
[Therefore, [exercises especially cyber exercises, play a central role
in establishing a resilient society.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Cyber exercises have gained a lot of attention throughout recent
years,]{.mark} especially in the cyber security sector, as an important
tool for security training, awareness-building and testing incident
response.]{.underline} The EU emphasizes the importance of this field in
its strategy for the digital decade (European Commission, 2020). [[Large
exercises]{.mark}, that make it to the news, such as
CyberStorm]{.underline} (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA), ), [[Locked Shields]{.underline}]{.mark} (The NATO Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, 2021) [or Cyber Europe]{.underline}
(ENISA, 2021[), represent only a small fraction of the exercises carried
out. [Conducting cyber exercises also has an educational value]{.mark}.
Through interactive activities, such as simulations and scenarios,
exercise participants [apply knowledge in practical situations using
techniques and tools]{.mark} they are familiar with, thereby deepening
their understanding of a particular type of incident]{.underline}
(Dewar, 2018).

#### Specifically, Cooperative training exercises focusing on space needed to shore up NATO space cybersecurity

[Training is essential to create awareness and prepare the alliance for
worst case scenarios. NATO could promote different types of training
that would capture space security and system vulnerabilities to
cyberattacks.]{.underline} Training areas could be selected through a
lessons-learned analysis where former cases could be used to highlight
areas of greatest need. Some examples are as follows: • [At the
political-strategic level, crisis management exercises]{.underline}
(CMX), [hybrid warfare exercises and similar training could incorporate
cyber resilience and bring space elements into cybersecurity
training.]{.underline} • At the technical level, given the complexity of
space systems, [focused training, modelling and simulation would be key
to ensuring design integrity]{.underline}. • [Bringing the technical and
political communities together in training modules would be
helpful.]{.underline} Often the political community and technical
community do not metaphorically speak the same language and their
concerns do not merge. [Such training would be technology-driven and
could incorporate modelling and simulation. Thus, technical expertise
and knowledge could be transferred into political action
plans.]{.underline} • Training may also involve the private sector or
contractors. NATO decides whether or not it should delegate parts of the
training to the private sector or to conduct it internally. There are
advantages and disadvantages in both. One of the advantages in
delegating the work to an outside party is that the latter could conduct
an analysis without any NATO restrictions and could significantly test
NATO's planning and operations. The main disadvantage is that NATO may
not be able to share classified information, which would make the
training less comprehensive. • [Some of the most useful training methods
involve exercises, 'war gaming', crisis simulations and scenario
planning, as well as online training education programmes, training
manuals, and certifications. NATO should also measure the impact of the
training and assess its skill-maintenance capacity.]{.underline}

components industry; 3. Operational planning; and 4.
Coordination/liaison with the allies on personnel requirements, in order
to [improve alliance knowledge and capacity on the use of space

that have either not invested in space technology or do not have
sufficient capability to protect their systems, look to NATO as an

[Jensen recalled a major cyber event in 2017, when shipping giant Maersk
was among thousands of companies that shut systems down to assess the
data damage.]{.underline} The Copenhagen-based container carrier's
estimate of the cost was around \$300 million. Back then, port operators
were among those with the most tangible consequences. While goods were
moved, the process was slowed as terminals reverted to manual or backup
operations. Still, [the global economy absorbed the shock without much
wider damage. With supply chains stretched to their limits, that's
unlikely to be the case now.]{.underline} No Buffer "In 2017 we could
essentially lose the largest carrier in the world for a week and it
didn't cause any major problems," Jensen said. "Sure, if you had your
cargo on board one of those ships it got delayed maybe a week or two and
that was annoying, but from a global perspective it was a non-event in
terms of disturbing the supply chain. [There was plenty of buffer
capacity --- of ships, terminals, everything. Right now we have zero, as
in literally zero, buffer capacity."]{.underline} Four of the world's
top five container lines are headquartered in western and northern
Europe, and at least one has been hit with a cyber attack since the
start of the pandemic. Marseille, France-based CMA CGM said in September
2020 that a breach hit services and affected bookings. Days later, the
International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency that serves
as the industry's regulatory body, said it suffered "a sophisticated
cyber attack" affecting its public website and internal systems. [In
mid-January, European Union governments took part in large-scale
simulation of a cyber intrusion affecting multiple member countries. The
six-week exercise was expected to model attacks on supply chains and
some spillover socio-economic effects in other countries.]{.underline}
"If they have done their jobs well, they have a good backup plan,"
Jensen said. ["In the current environment, taking just one major port
out of action for two, three, four days on top of what we're already
dealing with --- that will have major ramifications on the supply
chain."]{.underline}

#### And, NATO is central to the protection of global supply chains

[NATO plays an active role in]{.underline} global peacekeeping, has
built up the concept of co-operative security, and is a deterrent for
illegal and terrorist activities. And it is in this role that we see the
link between its activities and its importance to [global supply
chains.]{.underline} Protecting the Supply Chain [Current events such as
the war in Ukraine and global COVID restrictions]{.underline}, as well
as the ongoing threat of terrorist activity has [highlighted the
importance of stability and continuity in the supply chain.]{.underline}
For example, while Ukraine may not be a member of NATO, the [NATO
countries are using integrated logistics and supply routes to move arms,
vehicles and aid into the war zone.]{.underline} Through its actions in
the past, as well as actions it is taking now and for the future, [NATO
is providing support and protection for global supply
chains.]{.underline} Here are three key ways that demonstrate the
importance of the organisation to the global community: 1. Protection of
Key Infrastructure -- Energy Security [Energy and key utilities, such as
oil and gas, are critical for almost every aspect of global supply
chains. Disruption]{.underline} to sources or supplies of energy [could
easily undermine the security of countries and continents, leading to
situations where global production is halted, and supply of
everything]{.underline} from electronic components to food and drink [is
disrupted.]{.underline} [Vulnerabilities exist not only in
infrastructure]{.underline} (oil/gas pipelines; power stations), [but
also in the systems used to control and manage them, especially in light
of the increasing threat of cyber attacks.]{.underline} NATO members
have been working since 2008 on energy security programs to help protect
key infrastructure and ensure continuity of supply for both nations and
the military. 2. Counter Piracy Operations and Protection of Sea Lanes
Piracy continues to be a major threat to supply chains and freight in
key shipping lanes around the world. While it would seem that the threat
of piracy has lessened due to fewer serious incidents reported in the
press in recent years, it remains a problem for shipping companies. NATO
has in the past assisted in operations such as Operation Shield, an
international cooperation to combat piracy of the east coast of Africa.
Though this operation has since ended, NATO continues to work with
countries and global partners to assist further anti-piracy efforts.
[Without the protection that NATO affords]{.underline} in conjunction
with national navies and governments, [there is the potential for
disruptions]{.underline} to ships and cargo [that would have lasting
impacts on global supply chains.]{.underline} 3. Crisis Management
including Relief Supplies in event of Natural Disasters NATO plays a key
role in crisis and disaster management, both within its member countries
and outside of this region. For this, [NATO actually forms part of the
global supply chain, ensuring that aid, equipment and personnel are able
to reach areas]{.underline} affected by natural disasters. This can take
the form of physically shipping goods on behalf of its member nations,
as well as ensuring that requests for assistance from members or other
countries are conveyed to the correct areas of government. [While we may
not see the work that NATO does as part of, or to support, global supply
chains, its importance cannot be overemphasised. Without its efforts
since its inception over 70 years ago, the global supply chain would
look very different to how it does now.]{.underline}

Introduction [What the war in Ukraine says about cyber power is yet not
entirely cleared from the fog of war]{.underline}. Many aspects remain
uncertain, but given the unpredictability of the Putin regime, the risk
of an escalation in hostile cyber exchanges between Russia and NATO
states remains high. [What is clear is that, as of February 24, 2022, we
live in a different world in which the European and global security
orders have been shattered.]{.underline} This brief first explores the
challenge that cyber threats pose to NATO allies and how the rapidly
evolving cyber-threat landscape can alter the inter- national security
environment. Secondly, it looks at developments in cyber defense policy
within NATO. Finally, the brief analyzes how NATO needs to adapt to
address cyber challenges, studying how allies align their sovereign
interests, capabilities, and cyber doctrines with NATO operational
requirements and strategic ambitions. NATO is set to issue strategic
documents in 2022 that will guide the next decade of its military
planning. This will certainly require more transatlantic consultation on
political-military matters with an emphasis on cyber security and cyber
defense. The Cyber Challenge to the World and NATO Allies [Malicious
cyber activity has increased substantially]{.underline} over the past
years while the world has kept turning amid the omnipresent pandemic and
now war in Ukraine. [States, non-state actors, and criminal groups
compete and are increasingly weaponizing sensitive information and
infiltrating other countries' networks to steal data, seed
misinformation, or disrupt critical infrastructure.]{.underline} The
coronavirus [pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat
landscape]{.underline}. In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the spread
of the coronavirus led to social distancing measures, travel
restrictions, and remote work. In a short span of time, IT security
profes- sionals had to respond to the challenges of working from home,
such as enterprise data movements when employees accessed cloud-based
apps via their home internet, corporate software, videoconferencing, and
file sharing.1 Even if hardware and software solutions were in place to
secure the organization's data, there were often no established policies
to help employees wade through the jungle of threats and vulnerabilities
they faced when moving their workplace out of the traditional office
environment.2 According to the FireEye Mandiant Special Report: M-Trends
2021, the [top five most targeted indus- tries in 2020 were business and
professional services, retail and hospitality, finance, healthcare, and
high technology.]{.underline} The [main methods used were extortion,
ransom demands, payment card theft, and illicit trans- fers.
D]{.underline}irect financial gain was the likely motive for 36% of
intrusions, and an additional 2% of intrusions were likely perpetrated
to resell access. In 2021, data theft remained an important mission
objective for threat actors; in 32% of intrusions, adversaries stole
data.3 [Currently, highly organized, technically proficient criminal
syndicates comprise the most significant cyber threat to
allies]{.underline}. These groups try to steal data or extort money
through ransomware. In 2021, promi- nent ransomware attacks struck
Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the largest fuel pipeline on the East
Coast of the United States; JBS, the largest meat processing company in
North America; and Coop, a major supermarket chain in Sweden. Healthcare
was also targeted---in May of the same year, the entire health service
system of Ireland was disrupted for weeks, and over the spring and
summer, dozens of hospitals in Europe and the United States were locked
out of life-critical systems by ransomware attacks.4 [Another set of
threats comes in the form of bellig- erent state actors that seek to
steal sensitive data for espionage]{.underline}. In December 2020,
Russian intelligence services infiltrated the digital systems run by US
tech firm SolarWinds and inserted malware into its code. During the
company's next software update, the virus was inadvertently spread to
about 18,000 clients, including large corporations, the Pentagon, the
State Department, Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US
government agencies. The hack went unde- tected for months before the
victims discovered vast amounts of their data had been stolen.5 There
are [also politically motivated cyberattacks mandated by states that
interfere in democratic processes and political discourse]{.underline}.
In September 2020, the internal email system of Norway's parliament was
hacked.6 Ine Eriksen Søreide, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway,
underlined the significance of the attack by calling it an important
cyber incident that affected the "most important democratic institution"
of the country.7 Norwegian authorities later identified Russia as the
actor responsible for the attack, marking the first time that Norwegian
authorities had made a political attribution to such an attack. Since
the beginning of this year, [Ukraine's govern- ment has been hit by a
series of cyberattacks that defaced government websites and wiped out
the data on some government computers]{.underline}. In mid-Jan- uary,
hackers defaced about 70 Ukrainian websites, including the Ministries of
Foreign Affairs, Defense, Energy, Education, and Science, as well as the
State Emergency Service and the Ministry of Digital Trans- formation,
whose e-governance portal gives the Ukrainian public digital access to
dozens of govern- ment services. The hackers replaced the home pages of
about a dozen sites with a threatening message: "be afraid and expect
worse." After a couple of days,however, most of the sites were
restored.8 The [inter- national hacktivist collective Anonymous has
declared "cyberwar" against Russia's government, claiming credit for
several cyber incidents]{.underline} including distrib- uted denial of
service attacks that took down Russian government websites and Russia
Today, the state- backed news service.9 Around the globe, [aging
critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable to attack.]{.underline}
The [most worrying type of cyberattack is sophis- ticated malware
designed by states or state-backed actors that act as "time bombs" in
the critical cyber networks of target countries, such as the energy,
telecom, and transportation sectors]{.underline}. Around the globe,
aging critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable to attack. In
2020, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a warning of
Russian attacks on millions of routers, firewalls, and devices used by
infrastruc- ture operators and government agencies.10 On the day of the
Russian invasion, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed satellite broadband
services, was hacked along with one of its satellites Ka-Sat, whose
users included Ukraine's armed forces, police, and intelligence service.
[Destructive wiper malware attacks by Russia against
Ukraine]{.underline} included Whisper- Gate, discovered in January by
Microsoft, in Ukraine's networks that "provide critical executive branch
or emergency response functions";11 HermeticWizard and IsaacWiper,12
[targeting multiple Ukrainian orga- nizations just hours before the
Russian invasion began]{.underline}; and CaddyWiper, spotted by
researchers at the Slovak internet security company ESET in mid-March.13
[All of them were designed to wipe or overwrite critical files on
infected systems and leave computer hard drives corrupted and
unrecoverable.]{.underline} These incidents demonstrate that, in the
words of cyber expert and Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank
chairman Dmitri Alperovich, ["Cyberattacks have become a theater for
great-power conflict in which governments and militaries fight in the
hybrid 'gray zone,']{.underline} where the boundaries between peace and
war are blurred."14 The actors navigate a complex web of ambiguous and
deeply interconnected challenges, where [cyberattacks are not a separate
front, but rather an extension of the conflict.]{.underline}

NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain

[Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats.]{.underline} Within the
Alliance, however, [**offensive cyber effects are not yet part of the
mission planning process and integration of national offensive cyber
capabilities into joint NATO operations is voluntary.** Integrating
these national offensive cyber capabilities into NATO operations, thus
requires, not only a clear understanding of these capabilities, but also
agreement on the cyber threat environment,]{.underline} characterized by
the intent and capabilities of NATO's current and/or potential future
adversaries. [State adversaries in the cyber domain include Russia,
China and/or Iran.]{.underline} [These are countries known to be
building offensive cyber capabilities specifically for the purpose of
using them against NATO memberstates]{.underline}.7 [In Russia's case,
cyber attacks were conducted against the critical infrastructure of NATO
member states and partner nations]{.underline}, as for example against
US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear powerplant
near Burlington, Kansas)8 or against the Ukraine power grid in December
2015. [China has also been conducting persistent cyber espionage using
offensive cyber capabilities against core military and critical
infrastructure of NATO member states for years]{.underline}. For this
reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark T. Esper, remarked at the 2020
Munich Security Conference that the 5G Huawei infrastructure is a
serious threat to NATO.9 Lastly, [Iran's offensive cyber capabilities
have also been observed during multiple attacks against the critical
infrastructure of NATO partner nations in the Middle East. NATO
adversaries]{.underline} in the cyber domain also [include non-state
actors]{.underline}, such as terrorist organizations. [The US and the UK
have conducted several successful offensive cyber operations against
those entities]{.underline}. [These offensive cyber operations had a
significant force multiplier effect, in conjunction with conventional
actions on the ground, at sea, in the air and from space, that
contributed to the defeat of Daesh in both Iraq and
Syria.]{.underline}10 Today, [most Allies are building offensive cyber
capabilities needed to deny adversaries the freedom of maneuver in the
cyber domain.]{.underline}

#### -And, despite national development of some offensive cyber capabilities, unilateral policies like US CyberCommand persistent engagement and defend forward cyber posture undermine NATO capacity and create distrust

Steady progress

[Member states agree on the critical need for a coherent cyber policy.
Almost all NATO allies have developed both a cyber security strategy and
a cyber defense strategy]{.underline}.1 Some states have published
updated versions over the years to reaffirm cyber security as an issue
of national security importance, to tweak institutional
responsibilities, or to articulate changes in the threat landscape. [In
addition, since 2018, most NATO allies have established a military cyber
organization (either a command or unit) with a mandate to conduct cyber
effect operations]{.underline} -- that is, cyber operations intended to
disrupt, deny, degrade and/or destroy.2 [There is also shared
recognition that international law applies in cyberspace]{.underline},
although allies have yet to spell out the legal procedures for operating
in this new "domain of warfare."

[These developments have been both reflected in, and aided by, policy
progress made at the inter-governmental level.]{.underline} At the
Prague Summit in 2002, NATO for the first time recognized that the
Alliance should "Strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber
attacks."3 In 2008, at the Bucharest Summit, there was another milestone
development, when NATO adopted a "Policy on Cyber Defense," aiming to
"protect key information systems in accordance with their respective
responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to
assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack."4 In the
same year, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence -- a NATO
accredited international research institution -- was established in
Tallinn, Estonia. In 2016, at the Warsaw Summit, cyberspace was
officially recognized as a "domain of operations" and allies made a
Cyber Defense Pledge to enhance their cyber defenses.5 The 2018 Brussels
Summit and 2020 London Summit reiterated NATO's commitment to implement
the Cyber Defense Pledge and operationalize the Cyber Operations Center,
responsible for situational awareness and the centralized planning of
cyber operations and missions.6 In January 2020, the Allied Joint
Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations was published "to plan, execute and
assess cyberspace operations (CO) in the context of allied joint
operations."7

Steady divergence

[Yet when it comes to the direction of allies' cyber policy, growing
differences are apparent -- especially in the development and deployment
offensive cyber capabilities.]{.underline} First, even though most
states now have -- or are in the process of -- establishing a cyber
command, [operational capabilities vastly differ across
states.]{.underline}

[Whereas some governments are increasingly allocating significant
resources to conduct cyber operations]{.underline} -- and are now
starting to benefit from these investments -- [the majority of allies
still run their cyber commands]{.underline} on a budget of a few million
a year --an [amount that is insufficient for effective
operations]{.underline} in the cyber domain.

Secondly, [until a few years ago, NATO members' strategic visions were
largely aligned. National cyber strategies shared a common threat focus
on operations that could potentially cause major societal havoc, such as
taking down the power grid.]{.underline} Allies' national strategies
were also largely unified in their vision to address this threat,
discussing the need for deterrence, resilience, and norms. However,
[this changed with the publication of the US Department of Defense's
strategy on Defend Forward and US Cyber Command's vision on Persistent
Engagement]{.underline}.8 The [United States emphasizes the need to
cause friction]{.underline} "[wherever the adversary
maneuvers]{.underline}," [operating]{.underline} "globally, continuously
and seamlessly" (potentially) [below the threshold of armed
attack.]{.underline} "We must...maneuver seamlessly across the
interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as possible to
adversaries and their operations, and continuously shape the battlespace
to create operational advantage for us while denying the same to our
adversaries," in the words of NSA director and Cyber Command head Gen.
Paul Nakasone.9 **[Whereas deterrence is about changing your adversary's
cost-benefit calculus, Persistent Engagement is about taking the
opportunity away from the adversary to act.10]{.underline}**

Third, NATO member positions on how international law applies --
particularly the obligations of states vis-a-vis sovereignty -- are now
more divergent than a decade ago. Whereas countries like the Netherlands
and France are located on the side of the "sovereignty as a rule" camp,
the United Kingdom has taken the position that a remote cyber operation
by one state into another's cyber systems or network does not violate
the latter's sovereignty.

#### Thus the plan - The United States should increase security cooperation with North Atlantic Treaty Organization by expanding offensive cyber operations military to military exercises.

#### Advantage 1 - Cyber Threats 

#### Failure to deter cyber threats through offensive operations results in two scenarios:

#### Scenario 1 -- Critical infrastructure 

#### Critical infrastructure attack risk nuclear meltdowns, blackouts and financial crises

Cyber as a hybrid threat to, and enabler of, military operations

[All future military confrontations are expected to be fought with cyber
weapons. [These offensive cyber capabilities in the hands of adversaries
pose a significant threat to the military forces and critical
infrastructure of NATO member states;]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
[[Alliance recognizes that cyber-attacks (as hybrid threats) can be as
damaging as conventional ones]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is because
[[malicious cyber activities against computers]{.underline} that
[control physical processes can be as dangerous as threats that are
purely physical in nature and could lead to explosions, nuclear
meltdowns, blackouts, or financial crises]{.underline}]{.mark}. As put
by NATO Secretary General, "in just minutes[, [a single cyberattack can
inflict billions of dollars' worth of damage to our economies, bring
global companies to a standstill, paralyze our critical infrastructure,
undermine our democracies and cripple our military
capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}".4

#### Scenario 2 -- supply chains

#### Supply chain attacks have been small, but massive escalation is coming

[[The epic software supply chain attacks over the past
year]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the high-profile breaches of
SolarWinds, Microsoft Exchange Server, Kaseya, and Codecov, [[were only
the beginning.]{.mark} [\"Supply chain attacks are only just
starting]{.mark}, and mostly with pretty small vendors that most people
had not heard of beforehand,\"]{.underline} said Corellium COO Matt
Tait, in a live conversation via video with Black Hat founder Jeff Moss.
[But [what happens when]{.mark} these [attacks get bigger and affect
larger vendors]{.mark} and more of their customers?]{.underline} Tait --
who also delivered the prerecorded keynote, which was streamed on
multiple large screens in a ballroom at the Mandalay Bay Conference
Center in Las Vegas yesterday -- said in the live portion of the event
that [[the]{.mark} relative [impact]{.mark} of these high-profile
attacks [could have been much worse]{.mark} given they were mostly
targeted.]{.underline} He warned [[there will be more and they
could]{.mark} well [wreak more extensive and widespread damage]{.mark}
to more organizations if the attackers hit larger targets with massive
customer bases]{.underline}, such as the recent theft of source code
from gaming giant EA Games. \"[[It\'s likely to start to escalate in the
coming]{.underline}]{.mark} months and [[years]{.mark},\"]{.underline}
he said. \"[And when something really big happens \... [everything else

longer be a \"sustainable\" situation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### With supply chains stretched thin, disruption would be economically catastrophic -- there's zero buffer

[Jensen recalled a major cyber event in 2017, when shipping giant Maersk
was among thousands of companies that shut systems down to assess the
data damage.]{.underline} The Copenhagen-based container carrier's
estimate of the cost was around \$300 million. Back then, port operators
were among those with the most tangible consequences. While goods were
moved, the process was slowed as terminals reverted to manual or backup
operations. Still, [the global economy absorbed the shock without much
wider damage. With supply chains stretched to their limits, that's
unlikely to be the case now.]{.underline} No Buffer "In 2017 we could
essentially lose the largest carrier in the world for a week and it
didn't cause any major problems," Jensen said. "Sure, if you had your
cargo on board one of those ships it got delayed maybe a week or two and
that was annoying, but from a global perspective it was a non-event in
terms of disturbing the supply chain. [There was plenty of buffer
capacity --- of ships, terminals, everything. Right now we have zero, as
in literally zero, buffer capacity."]{.underline} Four of the world's
top five container lines are headquartered in western and northern
Europe, and at least one has been hit with a cyber attack since the
start of the pandemic. Marseille, France-based CMA CGM said in September
2020 that a breach hit services and affected bookings. Days later, the
International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency that serves
as the industry's regulatory body, said it suffered "a sophisticated
cyber attack" affecting its public website and internal systems. [In
mid-January, European Union governments took part in large-scale
simulation of a cyber intrusion affecting multiple member countries. The
six-week exercise was expected to model attacks on supply chains and
some spillover socio-economic effects in other countries.]{.underline}
"If they have done their jobs well, they have a good backup plan,"
Jensen said. ["In the current environment, taking just one major port
out of action for two, three, four days on top of what we're already
dealing with --- that will have major ramifications on the supply
chain."]{.underline}

#### And, NATO is central to the protection of global supply chains

[NATO plays an active role in]{.underline} global peacekeeping, has
built up the concept of co-operative security, and is a deterrent for
illegal and terrorist activities. And it is in this role that we see the
link between its activities and its importance to [global supply
chains.]{.underline} Protecting the Supply Chain [Current events such as
the war in Ukraine and global COVID restrictions]{.underline}, as well
as the ongoing threat of terrorist activity has [highlighted the
importance of stability and continuity in the supply chain.]{.underline}
For example, while Ukraine may not be a member of NATO, the [NATO
countries are using integrated logistics and supply routes to move arms,
vehicles and aid into the war zone.]{.underline} Through its actions in
the past, as well as actions it is taking now and for the future, [NATO
is providing support and protection for global supply
chains.]{.underline} Here are three key ways that demonstrate the
importance of the organisation to the global community: 1. Protection of
Key Infrastructure -- Energy Security [Energy and key utilities, such as
oil and gas, are critical for almost every aspect of global supply
chains. Disruption]{.underline} to sources or supplies of energy [could
easily undermine the security of countries and continents, leading to
situations where global production is halted, and supply of
everything]{.underline} from electronic components to food and drink [is
disrupted.]{.underline} [Vulnerabilities exist not only in
infrastructure]{.underline} (oil/gas pipelines; power stations), [but
also in the systems used to control and manage them, especially in light
of the increasing threat of cyber attacks.]{.underline} NATO members
have been working since 2008 on energy security programs to help protect
key infrastructure and ensure continuity of supply for both nations and
the military. 2. Counter Piracy Operations and Protection of Sea Lanes
Piracy continues to be a major threat to supply chains and freight in
key shipping lanes around the world. While it would seem that the threat
of piracy has lessened due to fewer serious incidents reported in the
press in recent years, it remains a problem for shipping companies. NATO
has in the past assisted in operations such as Operation Shield, an
international cooperation to combat piracy of the east coast of Africa.
Though this operation has since ended, NATO continues to work with
countries and global partners to assist further anti-piracy efforts.
[Without the protection that NATO affords]{.underline} in conjunction
with national navies and governments, [there is the potential for
disruptions]{.underline} to ships and cargo [that would have lasting
impacts on global supply chains.]{.underline} 3. Crisis Management
including Relief Supplies in event of Natural Disasters NATO plays a key
role in crisis and disaster management, both within its member countries
and outside of this region. For this, [NATO actually forms part of the
global supply chain, ensuring that aid, equipment and personnel are able
to reach areas]{.underline} affected by natural disasters. This can take
the form of physically shipping goods on behalf of its member nations,
as well as ensuring that requests for assistance from members or other
countries are conveyed to the correct areas of government. [While we may
not see the work that NATO does as part of, or to support, global supply
chains, its importance cannot be overemphasised. Without its efforts
since its inception over 70 years ago, the global supply chain would
look very different to how it does now.]{.underline}

Conclusion

[The lack of integrated offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities undermines
both the unity of the Alliance and its mandate of defence and
deterrence]{.underline}. On the former, [the lack of coordination
between Allies during unilateral cyber operations could lead to
friction]{.underline} when resulting effects infringe on Allied
cyber-physical infrastructures. It [could also lead to cyber
fratricide]{.underline}, [when failure to properly attribute Allied
digital personas occurs during these military operations]{.underline}.
On the latter, [while most Allies are developing offensive cyber
capabilities, some remain unable to face the growing number of cyber
threats unilaterally.]{.underline}

[Successful defence and deterrence in the cyber domain calls, thus, for
ready collective offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities that, when
integrated with NATO operations, would complement national and/ or
regional responses to malicious cyber activities]{.underline}. If and
when this integration occurs, NATO Flexible Deterrence Options would
also need to be agreed upon in order to signal cyber adversaries that
Allies will respond with one voice if attacked in the cyber domain.
[Ultimately, political consensus within the Alliance would still need to
be built on the type of needed collective offensive cyber capabilities
(such as for A2/ AD purposes) and on how to integrate them into NATO's
existing operations and missions.]{.underline}

#### Advantage 2 -- NATO Credibility

[[After Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}, European NATO allies are
now l[ikely to increase investments]{.mark} in their armed forces [that
could make a successful conventional defense possible in the
future]{.mark}]{.underline}. Germany's decision to double its defense
budget is telling in this regard. [NATO's increase in troops deployed to
Eastern Europe is also a positive recent development. But [these
developments will take time to bear fruit.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Currently, NATO's defense of the Baltics hinges on the threat of
responding to a Russian attack with its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}.
[But Putin's recent nuclear saber-rattling suggests he may not find this
threat credible and believes Washington will back down rather than risk
nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, even during the Cold War, it
was difficult enough to convince the Soviet Union that the United States
would trade Berlin for Boston. Expanding the alliance has only
heightened this challenge. How can the United States make Putin believe
that it is willing to trade Vilnius for New York?

#### Cyber threats erode nuclear deterrent -- vulnerabilities undermine effective conventional and nuclear deterrence

[Less attention]{.underline}, however, [has been devoted to the
cross-domain nexus between adversary cyber campaigns below the level of
war and the implications for]{.underline} conventional or [nuclear
deterrence]{.underline} and warfighting capabilities.5 The most critical
comparative warfighting advantage the United States enjoys relative to
its adversaries is its technological edge in the conventional weapons
realm---even as its hold may be weakening.6 Indeed, this is why
adversaries prefer to contest the United States below the level of war,
in the gray zone, and largely avoid direct military confrontation where
they perceive a significant U.S. advantage. At the same time[,
adversaries are making substantial investments in technology and
innovation to directly erode that edge]{.underline}, while also
shielding themselves from it by developing offset,
antiaccess/area-denial capabilities.7 Moreover, adversaries are engaging
in cyber espionage to discern where key U.S. military capabilities and
systems may be vulnerable and to potentially blind and paralyze the
United States with cyber effects in a time of crisis or conflict.8

Therefore, [while technologically advanced U.S. military capabilities
form the bedrock of its military advantage, they also create cyber
vulnerabilities that adversaries can and will undoubtedly use to their
strategic advantage. To support a strategy of full-spectrum
deterrence,]{.underline} [the United States must maintain credible and
capable conventional and nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. However,
**[adversaries could hold these at risk in cyberspace, potentially
undermining deterrence.]{.underline}** If deterrence fails in times of
crisis and conflict, the United States must be able to defend and surge
conventional capabilities when adversaries utilize cyber capabilities to
attack American military systems and functions. [In this way, cyber
vulnerabilities that adversaries exploit in routine competition below
the level of war have dangerous implications for the U.S. ability to
deter]{.underline} and prevail in conflict above that threshold---even
in a noncyber context. [The strategic consequences of the weakening of
U.S. warfighting capabilities]{.underline} [that support]{.underline}
conventional---and, even more so, [nuclear---deterrence are
acute]{.underline}. Additionally[, the scope and challenge in securing
critical military networks and systems in cyberspace is
immense.]{.underline} Therefore, urgent policy action is needed to
address the cyber vulnerabilities of key weapons systems and functions.

For decades, [Americans and Europeans did not have to think about the
dynamics of large-scale warfare between great powers or the possibility
of nuclear escalation. Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine has
shattered that sense of security]{.underline}. What's more, the invasion
of Ukraine, and the rhetoric surrounding it, has revealed the scope of
Vladimir Putin's grand ambitions: He wishes to reconstitute as much of
the old Russian/Soviet empire in Eastern Europe as he can. The
delegitimization of Ukraine has thrown into doubt the legitimacy of
former Soviet republics Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia and even
neighboring states such as Finland and Poland. Putin regards the
collapse of the Soviet Union as the "greatest geopolitical catastrophe
of the century" and laments that it caused "tens of millions of our
fellow citizens and countrymen to live beyond the fringes of Russian
territory." Putin feels that in order to be secure, Russia needs to
revise the current balance of power in Europe. This ambition is
consistent with scholarship that explains Russian foreign policy as a
product of Putin's illiberal, conservative philosophy and Putin's desire
to develop a Russian sphere of influence in the post-Soviet space. [In
the long run, the best way for NATO to deter him is to have enough
conventional forces in Eastern Europe to deny Russia the ability to take
the territory of countries]{.underline} such as Latvia, Lithuania,
Estonia, and Poland. [But NATO does not have the capability to do this
at the moment, and it will take time to develop it. In the intervening
"window of vulnerability," the American extended nuclear deterrent and
NATO's tactical nuclear weapons will form the backbone of European
security. The best way to ensure the credibility of this deterrent
depends, in turn, on the outcome of the current war. If,]{.underline} as
appears likely, [Russia gets bogged down in a long drawn-out fight in
Ukraine]{.underline}, [it may have an incentive to expand the conflict
by attacking an Eastern European NATO country]{.underline}. [To deter
this, the United States and NATO should increase the credibility of
their nuclear deterrent]{.underline} by embracing a moderate form of the
[brinkmanship tactics]{.underline} articulated by an earlier generation
of nuclear strategists. This would entail altering America's and NATO's
nuclear posture such that it [threatens to use its nuclear weapons
earlier in a conflict.]{.underline} [This solution is not ideal and
should only be regarded as a short-term fix, but European security today
requires NATO to accept a degree of brinkmanship.]{.underline}

[Although the overall military power of the United States and the NATO
alliance vastly outstrips that of Russia, a regional conflict close to
Russia's borders would pose enor- mous challenges and could result in
defeat for the West.]{.underline} Its relatively successful intervention
in Syria notwithstanding, Russia's power-projection capabilities are
modest compared with those of the Soviet Union, much less the contempo-
rary United States. [Around its periphery]{.underline}, however, [Russia
is a formidable adversary that enjoys considerable local overmatch
against the easternmost NATO states]{.underline}. Although at present
the Russian government appears to have little appetite to challenge NATO
by exploiting this local advan- tage, [the possibility that Russian
leaders will be tempted to do so in the future cannot be ruled
out]{.underline}.

Current [Russian military capabilities]{.underline} have [benefited
from]{.underline} a decade of [reform and modernization]{.underline}
[inaugurated by the 2008 war with Georgia.]{.underline} Although Moscow
swiftly subdued the Georgians in that conflict, it revealed numer- ous
inadequacies in Russian military equipment and prac- tice. Transitioning
away from the mass-mobilization draft army inherited from the Soviet
Union, [Russian officials evolved toward a smaller, more professional,
dynamic force consisting substantially of contract
soldiers]{.underline}. [Moscow also expended considerable resources
updating the Russian mil- itary's aging stockpile of weapons and
military equipment. Russian successes in eastern Ukraine
and]{.underline} its intervention in [Syria show]{.underline} that these
[changes have been]{.underline} rather [effective.]{.underline}

The current [Russian military boasts vastly greater capabilities than
those of any adversary the United States has engaged with in combat in
many decades]{.underline}. [Moscow has]{.underline} fielded
[sophisticated]{.underline} (albeit untested) [IADS]{.underline} that
would complicate NATO efforts to secure air superior-ity. [Russia could
exploit the A2/AD bubble facilitated by these IADS to launch an
air-supported ground invasion against NATO forces along its
periphery]{.underline}. On the battlefield, Russia has continued the
Soviet tradition of emphasizing massed indirect fires and various kinds
of armor. [Moscow also has a relatively limited arsenal of long-range
strike weapons, including ballistic and cruise missiles, that can be
employed in either a conventional or a nuclear role]{.underline}. Thanks
to these strike capabilities, [NATO rear and theater areas might offer
little sanctuary from Russian attacks.]{.underline} Furthermore, [Russia
has modernized electronic warfare, cyber, and counterspace capabilities
tailored to undermine NATO's technical advantages.]{.underline}

[The challenge of potential conflict with Russia is significantly
exacerbated by]{.underline} [Moscow's]{.underline} formidable [nuclear
arsenal]{.underline}. [Moscow possesses the world's largest arsenal of
NSNW. Even if these weapons are not used, they will play a considerable
role in shaping a NATO-Russia war]{.underline}. [Any conventional
conflict with Russia will have to be fought in a way designed to limit
the risk of nuclear escalation, which might constrain NATO from
employing its full capabil- ities.]{.underline} For instance,
[NATO's]{.underline} [SEAD]{.underline}/ destruction of enemy air
defense [campaign]{.underline}---needed to secure air superiority---
[might be treated as]{.underline} [a highly escalatory threat by
Moscow]{.underline}, eliciting an attack on the NATO facilities
supporting it. Although [there is little reason to believe that Russian
leaders would take the decision to go nuclear lightly, if they did make
such a decision, it appears that there are highly attractive
countermilitary targets for NSNW such as airbases and command and
control sites]{.underline}. The [destruction]{.underline} of these
[could]{.underline} significantly [diminish NATO's conventional
advantages.]{.underline} Unfortunately, [the acquisition of NSNW capa-
bilities equivalent to those of Russia are not guaranteed to neutralize
this problem: instead, Russian decisionmakers need to be convinced that
limited nuclear use is unlikely to yield either military or political
benefits.]{.underline}

#### -And, independently, cyberattacks on dual-use C3I system risk escalation from entanglement, misinterpretation, and preemptive countermeasures

\*C3- command, control, communications

The increasing [reliance on dual-use C3 assets,]{.underline} those used
both for conventional and nuclear operations, [raises the issue of
entanglement and]{.underline} the risk of [rapid
escalation]{.underline}. These dual-use assets can range from
communications satellites to early warning systems, radars and
transmitters. According to recent research, notably by James M. Acton,
parties to a conflict 'could have [strong incentives to
attack]{.underline} the [adversary's dual-use C3I]{.underline}
\[command, control, communication and intelligence\] capabilities [to
undermine]{.underline} its [nonnuclear operation]{.underline}s'.117 [An
attack on]{.underline} a [dual-use C3 asset would]{.underline}
particularly [hold strong incentives for adversaries possessing nuclear
weapons and]{.underline} not ruling out [their potential
use]{.underline}. For instance, a cyberattack on early warning
satellites will provide a tremendous advantage to the adversary by
either delaying the detection of a missile launch (conventional or
nuclear) or even preventing it from being identified in the first place.

James M. Acton addresses two [mechanisms that lead to
escalation]{.underline}.118 [First]{.underline} is a '[misinterpreted
warning']{.underline}, probably at a time of crisis, [where a state's
dual-use C3 assets]{.underline} are [targeted by conventional weapons or
cyber interferences]{.underline} and the target state might
[misinterpre]{.underline}t these attacks [as]{.underline} 'preparations
for an [incoming use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}' by their
adversary.119 The targeted state might miscalculate and respond in a
highly escalatory way that leads to full-scale conventional or nuclear
war. [Second]{.underline}, [if]{.underline} a state's [C3]{.underline}
capability was [attacked by conventional means]{.underline}, [it might
lose its advantage to destroy an adversary's nuclear weapon
systems]{.underline}. In order [to prevent]{.underline} such [a
situation happening]{.underline}, the [state might use pre-emptive
countermeasures that]{.underline} would themselves [lead to
escalation]{.underline},120 thus [adding nuclear 'use it or lose it'
pressures to conventional crises.]{.underline}

It is important to note that the escalation mechanisms identified by
Acton rest on hypothetical situations in which states that have been
forced, for the purposes of the argument, into adopting an inherently
escalatory posture; in reality, this may not be the inevitable outcome.
The role of [conventional forces and cyber interference]{.underline}s is
highlighted [primarily and under specific conditions as]{.underline} a
route to [escalation]{.underline}, [rather]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} also as a source of potential
[de-escalation]{.underline}. Although [risks of escalation through
entanglement might be greater]{.underline} in some cases, [it is hard to
judge]{.underline} a s[tate]{.underline}'s possible
[actions]{.underline} only [by]{.underline} [counting]{.underline} its
[conventional or nuclear capabilities]{.underline} [or]{.underline} by
[assigning an escalatory role]{.underline} to them. [Escalation is a
choice]{.underline}, and the logic of escalation mechanisms removes the
factor of human agency for conflict avoidance. [Ultimately, survival of
a state may not]{.underline}, in all instances, be [link]{.underline}ed
[to]{.underline} the [survival of its nuclear forces.]{.underline}

Over the past decade, [Allies have identified a steep increase in cyber
activities targeting the critical infrastructure sectors that NATO
military operations rely upon.]{.underline} Directly or indirectly,
[these malicious cyber activities can also disrupt the Alliance's
logistics and forward operations.]{.underline} [NATO's commitment to
"operate and defend itself "5 in the cyber domain]{.underline} as
effectively as in the geographic domains came, thus, as a direct
recognition of cyber as a hybrid threat to both the Allies and the
Alliance. Compared to the air, land and sea domains, [the cyber domain
is not constrained by national borders]{.underline} (although certain
physical aspects of it might be located within them). This distinction
between the cyber and the geographic domains is important to note,
because NATO was founded in response to external military threats
without the right to intervene in internal security matters, where
member states maintain the monopoly over the use of force. [In the cyber
domain, the distinction between internal and external security threats
is harder to ascertain]{.underline}. [When integrating offensive cyber
capabilities into its defence and deterrence mandate, NATO would
inevitably tackle certain aspects inherent to internal
security]{.underline}; [and yet, not legally infringe on the sovereignty
of the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or intervention are
not employed against the physical systems residing in these
nations]{.underline}.6 Operating in the cyber domain requires, thus,
that [member states better integrate their offensive cyber capabilities
into NATO operations not just to win future wars, but also to avoid
elements of friction between Allies, which may arise from unilateral
cyber effects to defend critical infrastructure.]{.underline}

Signaling for Resolve Versus Accommodation

Snyder and Diesing's foundational work on coercive diplomacy emphasizes
that [almost all international crises contain elements of both coercion
and accommodation]{.underline}.14 [For accommodation, resolve is less
imperative than more conciliatory signaling objectives,]{.underline}
such as willingness to make conces- sions, compromise, save face, and
avoid war.15 [Crisis management]{.underline}, as Snyder and Diesing
define it, [entails ensuring a state can achieve its stra- tegic
interests and mitigate potential risks of escalation.]{.underline} [The
challenge "is to find the optimum mix or trade-off between coercion and
accommoda- tion]{.underline} in the particular crisis context, given the
distribution of values and military power among the participants."16

[The distinction between coercion and accommodation rests on the rela-
tive emphasis on "winning" versus mitigating the risks of
war]{.underline}. [Coercion weighs the former more heavily, whereas
accommodation seeks to "reach some settlement that promises to defuse
the issue as a potential source of future crises"---without making too
many painful concessions]{.underline}.17 Nevertheless, each contains
elements of the other; [coercive strategies may include accommodative
tactics meant to address controlling escalation risks, and accommodative
strategies may include coercive tactics that seek to minimize
losses]{.underline}.18 Characteristics of accommodative actions include
demonstrating restraint, information sharing, clarifying shared
expectations and norms regarding limits on conflict, or creating space
for negotiations and diplomacy.19 Accommodative signaling is linked to
crisis de-escalation because the former can enable the latter. [Even a
"controlled reprisal" that is less escalatory than the prior action
could prompt both sides to de-escalate]{.underline}.20

The use of area denial weapon systems in the cyber domain

Anti-Access/Area Denial ([A2/AD) weapon systems have traditionally been
used by NATO and its member states to prevent an adversary's freedom of
maneuver on land, sea or air]{.underline}. In the geographic domains,
these capabilities include land mines, missiles (cruise, ballistic,
surface to air, anti-ship, etc.), submarines, electronic warfare, and
even Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE)
weapons. [[In the cyber domain A2/AD is achieved through offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Those operations have already been
used for the purpose of achieving A2/AD by NATO member states in the
cyber domain.]{.underline} This is the case of the US-led Operation
Glowing Symphony (OGS), where "the United States Cyber Command
reportedly acquired administrator passwords to \[Daesh\] websites. The
passwords enabled deletion of digital content, including videos used for
recruitment, from cyber infrastructure located in at least five
countries outside actively hostile areas of Iraq and Syria. Similar
digital content reportedly resided on cyber infrastructure in as many as
30 other States. Changing the passwords reportedly locked IS
administrators out of the websites".11 OGS restricted Daesh's freedom of
maneuver on networks physically residing in Iraq and Syria (which were
controlled by the terrorist group), but also worldwide, where a NATO
member state (the US) achieved denial of service effects against Daesh.
OGS disrupted Daesh propaganda through content removal from servers
residing in multiple countries and through restricting access to
physical infrastructure needed to store digital data. [Combined with
operational successes against ISIL on the ground, OGS actions resulted
in propaganda efforts being significantly reduced on several global
social media platforms, including Twitte]{.underline}r. [One particular
offensive cyber operation acted, ipso facto, as an A2/AD platform where
a NATO member state restricted access to physical networks critical for
Daesh recruitment, training, radicalization, fundraising, and command
and control.]{.underline} Integrating offensive cyber capabilities into
NATO's mandate for cyber deterrence and defence [[Operationalizing
warfighting capabilities in the cyber domain, beyond the traditional
geographic domains, requires a new way of fighting in the 21st century,
challenging the deterrence and defence mandate of the
Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline} Speaking at the Cyber Defence Pledge
Conference in London in May 2019, NATO Secretary General highlighted
that **for [[deterrence to have full effect against state and non-state
adversaries, NATO and its member states must be ready to use the full
range of capabilities at their disposal, to include national offensive
cyber capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**[. [Deterrence is the act of
diminishing an adversary's intent by highlighting the excessive costs
for the said adversary if it proceeds with an undesired
action]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} In NATO's case, [deterrence
is achieved by highlighting to an adversary the excessive costs
delivered through military means]{.underline} in the event of an attack
against [Allies. [For deterrence to be successful, the adversary must
believe that NATO is ready and willing to impose these excessive costs
across all operational domains, to include the cyber
domain.]{.mark}]{.underline} [This may [call for Allies to develop
offensive cyber capabilities and integrate them with NATO operations in
order to collectively impose a high enough cost to deter adversaries
from aggressive behaviour]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [To avoid
escalation to total war and cyber fratricide during the fog of
war,]{.underline} [Allies must also agree on a list of Flexible
Deterrent Options]{.underline} meant to allow for a gradual increase of
pressure in the cyber domain, and then hopefully limiting the scope and
intensity of conflict in this domain. NATO Flexible Deterrent Options in
the cyber domain could include (as presented in Figure 1): • Increasing
NATO's readiness posture through cyber education, training and
exercises; • Deploying NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams to conduct
defensive cyber operations and protecting critical infrastructure of
NATO member states and/or that NATO operations rely upon; • Increasing
public awareness of malicious cyber activities and the potential for
conflict in the cyber domain; • Taking steps to gain the support of all
NATO member states in response to the cyber threat and in accordance
with commitments of the 2016 Cyber Defence Pledge and the 2018 Brussels
Summit; • Triggering Article 4 of the Treaty to enhance
information-sharing and mutual assistance in the cyber domain; • Making
official statements addressing violations of international law in the
cyber domain; • Alerting and deploying offensive cyber operations
forces; • Imposing cyber sanctions;12 • Conducting offensive cyber
operations to achieve A2/AD effects in the cyber domain; • Triggering
Article 5 of the Treaty; and • Conducting offensive cyber operations in
combination with other maneuver forces across all operational domains.

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

[Given the threat environment facing NATO]{.underline}, as well as the
activities of several NATO members, [the alliance should
deliberately---but purposefully---consider incorporating offensive cyber
operations below the level of armed conflict into its deterrence
strategy.]{.underline} Any effort to explore a role for offensive cyber
operations should also consider the challenges and risks that may come
with doing so. A central challenge is that, at the political level[,
NATO allies lack consensus on the appropriate application of offensive
cyber power---especially below the level of armed conflict. Addressing
these disagreements among member states is essential because conducting
offensive cyber operations]{.underline} [often requires maneuvering
through or operating on networks]{.underline} [controlled by an ally or
allies]{.underline}. Right now, NATO members do not collectively agree
on the protocols and processes for partner actions in allied
networks---and they also disagree on how to define sovereignty in
cyberspace, or when an offensive cyber operation would rise to the level
of an armed attack.

[Offensive cyber operations for NATO also present real interoperability
challenges.]{.underline} The role of intelligence in cyber operations is
likely to complicate NATO planning processes. Even close allies are
likely to be wary about sharing sensitive intelligence for a number of
reasons. For instance, they may be averse to sharing information gleaned
from signals intelligence collection or because a member state may be
using the same exploits for both offensive action and their own
espionage---including intelligence collection against allies. Or, allies
may simply be worried that sensitive information may become exposed. On
top of this, [it's challenging to adjudicate intelligence requirements
among allies and to deconflict intelligence and military
priorities]{.underline}. It is also not clear whether the alliance has
established consensus thresholds that specify the conditions and
timeline under which a state would have to notify others of its
activities on their networks---if at all.

[The alliance should account for, and address, these issues as NATO
explores the prospect of incorporating offensive cyber operations below
the level of armed conflict into existing NATO simulations and exercises
that span the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.]{.underline}
A number of important questions about how to coordinate offensive cyber
operations and define roles and responsibilities remain unanswered. For
instance, how could allies improve intelligence sharing to conduct more
rapid attribution, enabling one state or the alliance to respond to
adversary cyber activity? What are the conditions under which allies
should consider dividing responsibilities for cyber campaign planning
and developing accesses and capabilities against strategic targets in,
for example, Russia? If some allies are responsible for offensive cyber
operations against certain targets, what are the information-sharing and
notification requirements?

gap.]{.underline}

[NATO members still hold advantages in their development of [new

According to the Global Innovation Index, seven of the top ten[ most

capabilities.]{.underline}

Action Plan for the Next Five Years

[To make NATO future-proof, it must be cyber-secure and
operational]{.underline}. But is it doing enough to address the complex
and evolving challenges of cyberspace? [NATO's strategic challenge is to
blend its successful conventional deterrence functions with a new
strategy for cyber action]{.underline}[. [NATO's ability to send a
collective message of resistance and to establish a credible threat
response is its most valuable asset on the cyber-security
front.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Four sets of actions for NATO are proposed. First, [denying covertness
by attribution: NATO should persuade opponents that they cannot be
clandestine in their cyber actions]{.underline}. NATO and its members
need to demonstrate that it is difficult or impossible to act covertly
and be clear about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks.

Until recently, governments did not publicly release details on cyber
incidents. [But since 2018, public disclosures of cyberattacks by
several Western powers indicate a new multinational policy of state
transpar- ency. The growing relevance of attribution is partially due to
states becoming better at attributing cyber operations]{.underline}.1
Greater public knowledge of cyberattacks heightens awareness of cyber
conflicts and leads to greater public acceptance of cyber
countermeasures.

Ultimately[[, what matters is that states engaging in unlawful actions
using cyber means will face conse- quences. With attribution,
policymakers show that they know what is happening in these networks and
can investigate incidents]{.underline}.]{.mark} It also clearly spells
out unacceptable behavior and can help create state prac- tice. The
[[best way to implement the international norms is by calling out
behavior and having conse- quences when these norms are
breached]{.underline}]{.mark}. Attribu- tion will make clear to the
malicious actor that their actions will be seen and addressed. It is the
basis, under international law, for countermeasures and self-defense.

When should states publicly attribute cyberat- tacks? [Effective public
attribution requires a clear understanding of the attributed cyber
operation and the cyber-threat actor, but also the broader geopo-
litical environment, allied positions and activities, and the legal
context]{.underline}. The [public attribution frame- work]{.underline}
put forward by Max Smeets and Florian Egloff in March 202127
[distinguishes four factors that act as enablers or constraints in
public attribution. These factors are intelligence, incident severity,
geopolitical context, and post-attribution actions.]{.underline} The
combina- tion of these four components enables consistent deci-
sion-making about whether to publicly disseminate information about an
adversary's actions, privately tell the adversary, or restrict knowledge
of the intrusion to the government and potentially other partners.

[[Collecting and processing intelligence---infor- mation about foreign
countries and their agents--- provides a technical basis for
attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}. How could allies improve intelligence
sharing to conduct more rapid attribution and enable a response to
adver- sary cyber activity? During the Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers
meeting in Tallinn in September 2020, a 90-minute tabletop exercise was
organized28 to test the ministers' ability to respond to and attribute
an esca- lating cyberattack. They answered multiple-choice questions on
communication of and possible diplo- matic countermeasures to the
attack. The minis- ters learned through first-hand experience that a
timely exchange of technical intelligence can be key in attributing any
cyberattack. "The shared view \[of the countries involved\]---especially
when it comes to complicated issues---is crucial," said Urmas Reinsalu,
Foreign Minister of Estonia.29

[Attribution is only as good as the information that allies are willing
to share. NATO's value can be in becoming the preferred platform for
sharing cyber information]{.underline}. General Paul Nakasone, who heads
US Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on
intelligence that "in 35 years" he has never seen a better sharing of
accu- rate, timely, and actionable intelligence than what has transpired
with Ukraine.30 [Sharing information and intelligence with allies
"builds coalitions" and can "shine a light on disinformation"
campaigns]{.underline}, like the one Russia used to lay the groundwork
for their invasion of Ukraine.

As the second course of action[**[, NATO should use the current crisis
to accelerate the progress with setting up NATO's own cyber command and
sharpen allied responses to malicious cyber actions]{.underline}**.
[Overall, this would give more credibility to its cyber
defense]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} In February 2019, allies
endorsed a set of tools to respond to cumulative cyber activities, but
not much has happened to take it forward. [It is now time to build upon
this set and develop concrete steps at the political, military, and
technical levels to model alli- ance behavior according to the threat
landscape.]{.underline} This means a sharper focus on future responses
to high- and low-end cyberattacks along with concrete deter- rence
actions and tools for individual sectors and target types. [Much of this
is based on the high-end cyber capabilities of select individual allies
called "volunteer sovereign cyber effects," where cyber- capable nations
deliver voluntarily offensive cyber effects on a target designated by an
operational-levelcommander]{.underline}. The [NATO Cyber Command would
be responsible for matching military needs with the willingness and
capabilities of the nations potentially able to deliver such
effects]{.underline}.31 **[[The alliance should clarify which allies are
responsible for offensive cyber operations against certain targets and
the informa- tion-sharing and notification
requirements.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[A good plan requires practice. The scenarios of cyber responses that
are under the Article 5 threshold should be regularly practiced,]{.mark}
and the NATO Cooper- ative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE)
[Locked Shields exercise is a good way to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Orga- nized since 2010, it enables cyber-security experts to enhance

Introduction [What the war in Ukraine says about cyber power is yet not
entirely cleared from the fog of war]{.underline}. Many aspects remain
uncertain, but given the unpredictability of the Putin regime, the risk
of an escalation in hostile cyber exchanges between Russia and NATO
states remains high. [What is clear is that, as of February 24, 2022, we
live in a different world in which the European and global security
orders have been shattered.]{.underline} This brief first explores the
challenge that cyber threats pose to NATO allies and how the rapidly
evolving cyber-threat landscape can alter the inter- national security
environment. Secondly, it looks at developments in cyber defense policy
within NATO. Finally, the brief analyzes how NATO needs to adapt to
address cyber challenges, studying how allies align their sovereign
interests, capabilities, and cyber doctrines with NATO operational
requirements and strategic ambitions. NATO is set to issue strategic
documents in 2022 that will guide the next decade of its military
planning. This will certainly require more transatlantic consultation on
political-military matters with an emphasis on cyber security and cyber
defense. The Cyber Challenge to the World and NATO Allies [Malicious
cyber activity has increased substantially]{.underline} over the past
years while the world has kept turning amid the omnipresent pandemic and
now war in Ukraine. [States, non-state actors, and criminal groups
compete and are increasingly weaponizing sensitive information and
infiltrating other countries' networks to steal data, seed
misinformation, or disrupt critical infrastructure.]{.underline} The
coronavirus [pandemic further complicated the cyber-threat
landscape]{.underline}. In March 2020, attempts to mitigate the spread
of the coronavirus led to social distancing measures, travel
restrictions, and remote work. In a short span of time, IT security
profes- sionals had to respond to the challenges of working from home,
such as enterprise data movements when employees accessed cloud-based
apps via their home internet, corporate software, videoconferencing, and
file sharing.1 Even if hardware and software solutions were in place to
secure the organization's data, there were often no established policies
to help employees wade through the jungle of threats and vulnerabilities
they faced when moving their workplace out of the traditional office
environment.2 According to the FireEye Mandiant Special Report: M-Trends
2021, the [top five most targeted indus- tries in 2020 were business and
professional services, retail and hospitality, finance, healthcare, and
high technology.]{.underline} The [main methods used were extortion,
ransom demands, payment card theft, and illicit trans- fers.
D]{.underline}irect financial gain was the likely motive for 36% of
intrusions, and an additional 2% of intrusions were likely perpetrated
to resell access. In 2021, data theft remained an important mission
objective for threat actors; in 32% of intrusions, adversaries stole
data.3 [Currently, highly organized, technically proficient criminal
syndicates comprise the most significant cyber threat to
allies]{.underline}. These groups try to steal data or extort money
through ransomware. In 2021, promi- nent ransomware attacks struck
Colonial Pipeline, the operator of the largest fuel pipeline on the East
Coast of the United States; JBS, the largest meat processing company in
North America; and Coop, a major supermarket chain in Sweden. Healthcare
was also targeted---in May of the same year, the entire health service
system of Ireland was disrupted for weeks, and over the spring and
summer, dozens of hospitals in Europe and the United States were locked
out of life-critical systems by ransomware attacks.4 [Another set of
threats comes in the form of bellig- erent state actors that seek to
steal sensitive data for espionage]{.underline}. In December 2020,
Russian intelligence services infiltrated the digital systems run by US
tech firm SolarWinds and inserted malware into its code. During the
company's next software update, the virus was inadvertently spread to
about 18,000 clients, including large corporations, the Pentagon, the
State Department, Homeland Security, the Treasury, and other US
government agencies. The hack went unde- tected for months before the
victims discovered vast amounts of their data had been stolen.5 There
are [also politically motivated cyberattacks mandated by states that
interfere in democratic processes and political discourse]{.underline}.
In September 2020, the internal email system of Norway's parliament was
hacked.6 Ine Eriksen Søreide, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Norway,
underlined the significance of the attack by calling it an important
cyber incident that affected the "most important democratic institution"
of the country.7 Norwegian authorities later identified Russia as the
actor responsible for the attack, marking the first time that Norwegian
authorities had made a political attribution to such an attack. Since
the beginning of this year, [Ukraine's govern- ment has been hit by a
series of cyberattacks that defaced government websites and wiped out
the data on some government computers]{.underline}. In mid-Jan- uary,
hackers defaced about 70 Ukrainian websites, including the Ministries of
Foreign Affairs, Defense, Energy, Education, and Science, as well as the
State Emergency Service and the Ministry of Digital Trans- formation,
whose e-governance portal gives the Ukrainian public digital access to
dozens of govern- ment services. The hackers replaced the home pages of
about a dozen sites with a threatening message: "be afraid and expect
worse." After a couple of days,however, most of the sites were
restored.8 The [inter- national hacktivist collective Anonymous has
declared "cyberwar" against Russia's government, claiming credit for
several cyber incidents]{.underline} including distrib- uted denial of
service attacks that took down Russian government websites and Russia
Today, the state- backed news service.9 Around the globe, [aging
critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable to attack.]{.underline}
The [most worrying type of cyberattack is sophis- ticated malware
designed by states or state-backed actors that act as "time bombs" in
the critical cyber networks of target countries, such as the energy,
telecom, and transportation sectors]{.underline}. Around the globe,
aging critical infrastructure has long been vulnerable to attack. In
2020, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a warning of
Russian attacks on millions of routers, firewalls, and devices used by
infrastruc- ture operators and government agencies.10 On the day of the
Russian invasion, ViaSat, a provider of high-speed satellite broadband
services, was hacked along with one of its satellites Ka-Sat, whose
users included Ukraine's armed forces, police, and intelligence service.
[Destructive wiper malware attacks by Russia against
Ukraine]{.underline} included Whisper- Gate, discovered in January by
Microsoft, in Ukraine's networks that "provide critical executive branch
or emergency response functions";11 HermeticWizard and IsaacWiper,12
[targeting multiple Ukrainian orga- nizations just hours before the
Russian invasion began]{.underline}; and CaddyWiper, spotted by
researchers at the Slovak internet security company ESET in mid-March.13
[All of them were designed to wipe or overwrite critical files on
infected systems and leave computer hard drives corrupted and
unrecoverable.]{.underline} These incidents demonstrate that, in the
words of cyber expert and Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank
chairman Dmitri Alperovich, ["Cyberattacks have become a theater for
great-power conflict in which governments and militaries fight in the
hybrid 'gray zone,']{.underline} where the boundaries between peace and
war are blurred."14 The actors navigate a complex web of ambiguous and
deeply interconnected challenges, where [cyberattacks are not a separate
front, but rather an extension of the conflict.]{.underline}

### Uniqueness - Grey zone attacks increasing 

#### Multiple examples of grey zone attacks against NATO allies -- need focus on offensive cyber operations

Point and research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace

Defense of Democracies, **2022**

[The primary threat to NATO allies in the cyber domain is not from
high-end, decisive cyberattacks.]{.underline} Instead, [cyber threats
more frequently and effectively manifest as gray zone
tactics]{.underline} designed to have a corrosive effect [without
rising]{.underline} to the level of [warfare]{.underline}. [There are
numerous examples of this type of threat]{.underline}. For instance, in
July 2021, NATO publicly condemned a range of malicious cyber behavior,
including the Microsoft Exchange hack (which NATO attributed to China)
and ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Russia has
leveraged cyber and disinformation operations to interfere in democratic
elections in the United States in 2016, 2018, and 2020; France in 2017;
and Germany in 2017 and 2021---to name just a few examples. Russia also
conducted distributed denial-of-service cyberattacks against government
websites in Montenegro during the lead-up to, and following,
Montenegro's ascension to NATO in 2017. And when NATO forces were
positioned in the Baltics beginning in 2017 as part of NATO's enhanced
forward presence, two threat actors, GhostWriter and Secondary
Infektion, conducted a range of disinformation campaigns. Additionally,
[the reality is that several NATO members are already speaking publicly
about offensive cyber operations below the level of warfare and their
statements and actions have an effect on the entire
allianc]{.underline}e. In particular, NATO member nations have not
reached a political consensus about the role of offensive cyber
operations. In 2018, the US Department of Defense and US Cyber Command
issued new strategy and policy documents that articulated a role for the
military in conducting offensive cyber operations below the level of
armed conflict outside of US-controlled cyberspace (part of the "defend
forward" strategy), and there has been some reporting about US offensive
cyber operations. For instance, in 2018 the United States disrupted the
Russian-linked Internet Research Agency from interfering in the midterm
elections. And, more recently, in December 2021 General Paul Nakasone,
commander of US Cyber Command, publicly acknowledged that the military
played a role in disrupting ransomware groups targeting critical
infrastructure. The [United States has also worked with other NATO
allies, such as Estonia and Montenegro, to conduct "hunt forward" cyber
operations on allied and partner networks]{.underline} to uncover and
disrupt malicious cyber activity. Other NATO allies have also been more
transparent about offensive cyber operations. In 2020, the United
Kingdom announced a significant investment in its National Cyber Force,
its organizational arm for offensive cyber operations, and its 2022
National Cyber Strategy emphasized the role of offensive cyber
operations. In November 2021, General Nakasone and the director of
Government Communications Headquarters---the UK government's principal
signals intelligence agency---stated jointly that the two governments
were collaborating to "impose consequences" in cyberspace to disrupt
adversary operations. The Netherlands has also publicly alluded to
conducting offensive cyber operations.

### Uniqueness - Attacks Increasing

#### There's been an exponential rise in attacks on critical infrastructure -- the payoff for attacker is massive

accessed 07/04/22, GDI-JCR\]

[As the globe continues to wobble through the reverberations of
COVID-19, observers say that the impact on critical infrastructure is
likely to worsen. Critical infrastructure]{.underline} -- which includes
government institutions, utilities, transportation and more -- [is now
more vulnerable than ever given an exponential increase in attacks on
the IoT technology that powers it. Such technology has become a "soft
target," for malicious actors.]{.underline} That's because Internet of
Things (IoT) technology may be legacy technology, with inadequate
updating and patching, and because the financial incentives to breach
its security have grown. [Attacks on IoT Technology Garner Big Payouts.
As a result, ransomware attacks on IoT have become more prevalent, with
larger payouts possible for malicious actors.]{.underline} Consider the
February 2021 attack on the Oldsmar water plant in Florida; an attempt
was made to manipulate the pH in the city's water to dangerously high
acidic levels by increasing sodium hydroxide (lye) by 100 times. In May
2021, the Colonial pipeline was attacked for a ransom. A password leaked
onto the dark web enabled malicious actors to access a virtual private
network, then gain access to and take down the largest fuel pipeline in
the U.S. Colonial paid the malicious attackers --- an affiliate of a
Russia-linked cybercrime group known as DarkSide --- a \$4.4 million
ransom shortly after the attack. Insiders say that the critical
infrastructure environment is rife for breaches. "The OT and ICS
\[incident command system\] space is, honestly, [the largest single
attack vector with the greatest potential for impact,]{.underline}" said
Curtis Simpson, CISO at Armis, in a podcast on critical infrastructure
attacks . "OT and ICS are [powering some of the most critical
infrastructure in the world; it's critical operations]{.underline},"
Simpson said. One bright spot on the ransomware front is that the U.S.
Department of Justice in April 2021 created a ransomware task force,
after declaring 2020 the "worst year ever" for extortion-related
cyberattacks. And accordingly, in June, the Justice Department said it
had seized the majority of the nearly \$4.4 million in bitcoin ransom
paid to DarkSide for the Colonial Pipeline takedown. Pandemic Times
Expand Definition of Critical Infrastructure According to the OECD, [the
pandemic has unveiled a broader set of infrastructure vulnerabilities
beyond transportation and fuel]{.underline}, for example. "Notably, [the
crisis has brought renewed focus on social or 'soft' infrastructure,
which is sometimes overshadowed by hard infrastructure like energy and
transportation in the context of resilience,"]{.underline} the OECD note
indicated. "[These infrastructures that maintain the economic, health,
education, cultural and social standards of a population are critical
elements of modern societies."]{.underline} Simpson echoed this notion.
He said that [even a business such as Sysco Foods]{.underline}, where he
worked previously, is in some ways critical infrastructure. Sysco is the
largest food distributor in the world, and that business, Simpson said,
[is run entirely on IoT]{.underline}, OT and ICS.

accessed 07/04/22, GDI-JCR\]

All during 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic swept around the world,
another novel virus with devastating long-term effects spread unnoticed
worldwide. Sometime in late 2019 or early 2020, at least one group of
advanced hackers inserted malware into network software supplied by
SolarWinds, a maker of information technology infrastructure software
based in Austin, Texas. The decision to target SolarWinds looks
strategic given the company's vast U.S. and global clientele in the
public, private, and nonprofit sectors. [Publicly exposed in December
2020, the infectious malware---dubbed Sunburst by the cybersecurity firm
FireEye and Solorigate by Microsoft---may turn out to be the most
audacious cyberespionage campaign in history.]{.underline} For months,
attackers stealthily infiltrated governments and businesses via a Trojan
horse-style update to SolarWinds' Orion cybersecurity management
software. Like the coronavirus, Sunburst and another recently discovered
piece of malware reveal the downside of global connectivity and the
failure of global cooperation to deal with contagion. [[What
sets]{.mark} the [SolarWinds]{.mark} attack [apart]{.mark} from previous
incidents [is its **sheer scale**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The company has
over 300,000 customers worldwide, according to filings made to the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Throughout 2020, SolarWinds sent out
software updates to roughly 18,000 of them. To date, at least 250
networks have reportedly been affected by the booby-trapped file.
Shortly after being downloaded, [the virus executes commands that create
a backdoor in the network to transfer files, disable services, and
reboot machines. [Targeted institutions include the U.S. departments of
Defense]{.mark}, Homeland Security, [State, Energy, and the Treasury;
all five branches of the]{.mark} U.S. [military]{.mark}; [the]{.mark}
[N]{.mark}ational [N]{.mark}uclear [S]{.mark}ecurity
[A]{.mark}dministration, [and 425 of the Fortune 500 companies]{.mark},
including Cisco, Equifax, MasterCard, and Microsoft. There have been
other major cyberattacks in the past, but [none has achieved this kind
of penetration]{.mark}]{.underline}. By **[compromising powerful
governments]{.underline}** and businesses, including some of the most
successful technology companies, [the [SolarWinds]{.mark} exploit
[shatters **the illusion of information
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The hack has also spooked the
financial services sector. Within hours of the attack's discovery, [U.S.
government officials and cybersecurity experts singled out Russia's
Foreign Intelligence Service (known as the SVR) as the likely
culprit]{.underline}. Its elite hacking unit, known in cybersecurity
circles as APT29 or "Cozy Bear," is a familiar adversary. It was
[reportedly behind digital breaches of the White House, State
Department, and Joint Chiefs of Staff in 2014 and 2015]{.underline}, as
well as the infamous hack of the Democratic National Committee during
the 2016 election campaign. The SVR hacked the party's servers alongside
another Russian team, APT28 or "Fancy Bear," which is overseen by
Russia's military intelligence agency, commonly known as the GRU. It was
the GRU that reportedly stole Democratic campaign emails and dumped them
online; in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted 12 Russians
suspected of involvement. [A few days after the SolarWinds compromise
became public, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
warned that the hack "poses a grave risk" to federal, state, and local
governments, as well as to private companies.]{.underline} Even more
ominously, the SolarWinds attack stretches far beyond the company's own
direct clients. This is not an open-and-shut case, however. One of the
most frustrating challenges for victims of cyberespionage and
cyberwarfare is [the difficulty of attributing an attack]{.underline}.
While the SolarWinds exploit was linked to the SVR in a joint statement
by U.S. intelligence agencies, [it is by the attack's very nature
impossible to be certain]{.underline}*.* Complicating matters, another
piece of malware that targeted SolarWinds at around the same
time---dubbed Supernova by Palo Alto Networks' Unit 42---appears to have
been planted by another actor. Meanwhile, US investigators are exploring
the possible involvement of JetBrain, a Czech firm founded in Russia
that counts SolarWinds among its clients, in spreading infected code via
its TeamCity product. For its part, the Russian Embassy in Washington
posted a statement on Facebook denying responsibility and claiming that
the attacks were opposed to Russia's foreign-policy interests. It also
added that "Russia does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber
domain." Contradicting his own secretary of state and intelligence
services, U.S. President Donald [Trump agreed with the Russians, hinting
that China might be to blame. What also makes the [SolarWinds]{.mark}
breach different from past attacks was how it was delivered, and the way
it [could serve as a **beachhead for future
attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike in the case of high-profile
phishing and hacking exploits against companies such as Equifax and
Sony, it is exceedingly difficult to trace how the SolarWinds compromise
occurred and determine which data was accessed and pilfered. [That's
because the victims of the SolarWinds attack were not confined to a
single organization or department, and [it is not possible to simply
eliminate the malware]{.mark} by wiping the system clean]{.underline}.
To the contrary: [[Hackers]{.mark} [ensured]{.mark} that they would have
[long-term access]{.mark} by adding new credentials and using
administrative privileges to grant themselves permissions [to]{.mark}
access various parts of [their victims' IT
infrastructure.]{.mark}]{.underline} What this means is that
[[this]{.mark} hyper-sophisticated [campaign]{.mark}---including the
theft of information from protected networks---[could go on for
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} Even more ominously, the SolarWinds attack
is what's known in security circles [[as a cascading **supply chain
compromise**]{.underline}]{.mark}---which means that it stretches far
beyond the company's own direct clients. While no one yet knows just how
many governments and businesses are affected, [tens of thousands of
other entities are at risk]{.underline}, many of which have little to do
with SolarWinds. And because the company's products are designed to
monitor digital networks and are therefore at the very heart of IT
infrastructure, they have extensive access and few constraints on their
reach. Making matters worse, [SolarWinds reportedly encouraged customers
to relax existing antivirus and security restrictions, which means that
even more of the network was accessible than usual. Attackers made use
of this unrestricted access to steal permissions and source code from
companies such as Microsoft and compromise even more
targets]{.underline}. [[The exploit is a reminder of the blurred lines
between espionage and warfare,]{.mark} and the difficulty of formulating
a proportional response.]{.underline} As diplomats know well, [[there is
no established international norm]{.mark} against
espionage]{.underline}---clandestine information collection is a
tolerated feature of international relations. When spying is publicly
exposed, what typically follows are some form of condemnation,
sanctions, and a focus on shoring up defenses to keep it from happening
again. However, the vast scale of the SolarWinds exploit---and the
strong probability of others like it that have yet to be
detected---should force a rethink. [[The potential for
weaponizing]{.mark} compromised [systems,]{.mark} including [by
sabotaging public utilities]{.mark} (as was the case in a recent
cyberattack tit-for-tat between Israel and Iran), [poses an
**existential threat**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A closed and
controllable internet will reinforce the authoritarian tendencies of
some governments [[and **end U.S. dominance of the digital
domain**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} The SolarWinds compromise [raises
even more urgent questions about the governance of the
internet]{.underline}. [It offers a disturbing reminder of the absence
of recognized global safeguards to prevent and respond to cyberattacks.
[States are]{.mark} operating [in a cybernetic Wild
West]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this is becoming [more dangerous in our
interconnected world.]{.underline} The status quo suited the main
cyberespionage and cyberwar combatants, such as the United States,
China, Israel, North Korea, and Russia. But these latest revelations
[expose the systemic risks of adopting a laissez-faire approach to
managing the digital commons. [A determined attacker can wreak havoc
on]{.mark} just about [any target and]{.mark} then just as quickly
[cover their tracks]{.mark} and disappear into the digital
ether.]{.underline} For two decades a governmental group of experts
convened by the United Nations has tried to nail down basic norms for
cyber-governance, but the major powers still cannot agree on first
principles. **[[The implications of having no]{.mark} established [rules
are more dangerous than ever.]{.mark}]{.underline}** A [major upgrade of
internet governance is required]{.underline}. A coalition of like-minded
countries, industry, and civil society groups need to push forward a
model that ensures, at minimum, protections for critical
infrastructure[. [Current efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as the
multi-stakeholder approach for internet governance undertaken by the
United Nations, may be necessary, but they [[have]{.mark} clearly [been
insufficient]{.mark} [in a digital era where massive compromises are
likely to become routine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not waiting for these
efforts and their uncertain outcomes, [[some countries are trying to
establish cyberdeterrence]{.underline},]{.mark} leading to the emergence
of de facto rules of engagement. [Yet **[the risks of catastrophic
miscalculation are]{.mark} likewise [growing.]{.mark} Norms related to
cyberespionage also need to be established lest it contributes to
unintended outcomes with global ramifications.**]{.underline}

[The healthcare industry could become the target of Russian

Ukraine, Politico reported March 27. A direct attack on U.S. healthcare
organizations is more likely if more countries get involved in the war
in Ukraine, or if sanctions cripple Russia, experts told Politico. [U.S.
officials have issued repeated warnings that U.S. industries, including
the healthcare industry, could be targets of Russian-backed hackers in
the wake of the invasion of Ukraine. \"If NATO gets

going to change the whole dynamic,]{.underline}\" Mac McMillan, CEO of
cybersecurity firm CynergisTek told Politico. \"Russia is being careful
not to do anything overtly to the United States at the moment.\" [The
U.S. healthcare industry has become a popular target for hackers as it
contains a plethora of vulnerable information that can be used to
leverage ransom demands from healthcare providers]{.underline}. In 2021,
nearly 50 million Americans had their protected health information
breached, which is triple the number reported in 2018.

Cyber as a hybrid threat to, and enabler of, military operations

weapons. [These offensive cyber capabilities in the hands of adversaries
pose a significant threat to the military forces and critical
infrastructure of NATO member states;]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
[[Alliance recognizes that cyber-attacks (as hybrid threats) can be as
damaging as conventional ones]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is because
[[malicious cyber activities against computers]{.underline} that
[control physical processes can be as dangerous as threats that are
purely physical in nature and could lead to explosions, nuclear
meltdowns, blackouts, or financial crises]{.underline}]{.mark}. As put

[Hackers have traditionally focused their attention on computer
software, resulting in a mushrooming of cyber security companies that
promise protections for office-based clients.]{.underline} But there is
another, [less well-known hacking threat: [cyber attacks on]{.mark} big
corporate operations, such as **[manufacturing]{.mark} facilities [or
power]{.mark} plants, [as well as other vital infrastructure]{.mark}.**
Such attacks [are becoming more commonplace,]{.mark}]{.underline}
[f]{.mark}uelling concerns that companies should ramp up their efforts
to guard against them. [This is no small challenge. For companies with
operational technology]{.underline} --- the computerised systems used to
control industrial operations [--- the risks of a breach are plentiful;
disruptions to machinery processes could dent revenues or cause an
accident. For those involved in "critical infrastructure"]{.underline}
--- the **[[dams, energy, oil and gas facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[required for society to function smoothly --- the risks are more
dramatic and [may attract nation state hackers,]{.mark} not just those
seeking financial gain.]{.underline} "**[[Our economy will disappear,
society will collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- **[[and these things
are possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [says Sujeet Shenoi, professor of
computer science at the University of Tulsa, who has been involved in
multiple government-led critical infrastructure projects.]{.underline}
"[**[There's never been a war]{.mark}** in human history
**[where]{.mark}** the **[critical infrastructure hasn't been
damaged]{.mark}**]{.underline}." He notes that [some 80 per cent of
critical infrastructure in the US is privately run]{.underline}. "[These
[companies are not prepared]{.mark} for \[a cyber attack\].]{.underline}
[You need extremely well trained people]{.underline}," he says, noting
the many former government experts are moving into the sector.
Historically, [critical infrastructure and operational technology were
kept separate from the computer networks typically used in corporate
headquarters]{.underline}. However, those worlds are now converging as
outdated analogue systems have become increasingly digitised. "[Systems
that have been developed over 30 or 40 years are having the internet
introduced to them]{.underline}," says Casey Ellis, founder and chief
technology officer at Bugcrowd, a cyber security group. [But
[**retrofitting systems** that were never intended to be on the internet
**creates new opportunities for hackers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, he says.
["**[The attack surface is expanding rapidly]{.mark}**."]{.underline} As
with normal IT systems, [ransomware and malware can be used to infect
operational technology and critical infrastructure. The most
high-profile worm was the 2010 Stuxnet malware, which targeted Iran's
nuclear facilities]{.underline}. Operations at the food company Mondelez
and drugmaker Merck were disrupted by the ransomware dubbed NotPetya in
2017. Ukraine has suffered a spate of attacks on its power grid system
recently, and earlier this year, Norwegian aluminium maker Norsk Hydro
had to freeze operations earlier after it fell victim to ransomware.
While the marketplace for cyber security companies offering support to
such groups is smaller than the traditional IT security space, experts
caution that companies should take action. [Moves might include
assessing company **systems to ensure staff know what devices are
connected to the network,**]{.underline} testing and monitoring those
systems, and devising a plan for worst-case scenarios. Above all,
companies should isolate the most critical systems [to ensure they can
keep them operating no matter what,]{.underline} says Pedro Abreu, chief
product and strategy officer at online security company Forescout, who
dubs the process "containing the blast area". "If a WannaCry \[attack\]
happens, I want to \[be able to\] shut down that facility or country"
while the rest of the network remains running, he says. [Various sectors
are equipped differently, experts say. Where deep-pocketed energy, and
oil and gas groups have been able to pour investment into bolstering
their protections, others, such as the water sector, are thought to be
lagging.]{.underline} To their advantage, Michael Fabian, principal
consultant at Synopsys, notes that operational technology systems are
"very restrictive", meaning that "some expertise is needed to hack
\[them\]". By comparison, "**[people providing [consumer services have a
massive attack surface]{.mark}]{.underline}**," he says, citing the
likes of Citibank, Target or Amazon. [Nevertheless, operational
technology systems have their own nuances. First, [testing them for
vulnerabilities can be difficult]{.mark} because the [systems are too
sensitive or essential to pause]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[There are things
that are ultra critical that we can't put at risk by testing
them,]{.underline} but we are doing just that --- putting them at risk
--- by not testing them," says Charles Henderson, global head of IBM's
hacking unit X-Force Red. This means cyber security companies may have
to test for vulnerabilities against a less reliable reproduction of an
actual system. [And if a problem is uncovered, it is harder to fix. "The
life cycles of those systems in the field is extraordinarily
long,]{.underline}" says Eric Cornelius, chief product officer at
BlackBerry Cylance, a cyber security group. Moreover, even if cyber
security companies offer solutions, it can be many years before a system
can be updated. For example, many companies would opt to rebuild an
offshore gas plant once it has finally stopped running, rather than
upgrade at great cost, Mr Cornelius says.

### Impact - Critical Infrastructure Snowballs

#### Attacks on critical infrastructure on the rise. Attacks can ripple across sectors.

accessed 07/04/22, GDI-JCR\]

In August 2021, Forescout Research Labs and JFrog Security Research
identified 14 vulnerabilities affecting the NicheStack TCP/IP stack,
which the organizations dubbed INFRA:HALT. TCP/IP stacks enable vendors
to implement basic network communications for IP-connected systems,
including IT, operational technology (OT) and Industrial Internet of
Things (**[IoT]{.underline}**) devices. Indeed, NicheStack [**is present
in myriad OT devices that are commonly used in [several critical
infrastructure sectors]{.mark}**[, such as manufacturing]{.mark} plants,
[water treatment]{.mark}, [power generation and
more]{.mark}.]{.underline} The new vulnerabilities enable remote code
execution, denial of service, information leak, TCP spoofing, or DNS
cache poisoning. Critical Infrastructure Attacks Reveal ICS Weak Spots
The vulnerabilities discovered illuminate the risk to critical
infrastructure systems should they be compromised by malicious actors.
[These systems [are aging and vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
said experts. ["It is ... an unfortunate example of the huge
vulnerability of an aging infrastructure that has been connected,
directly or indirectly, to the Internet,"]{.underline} said Curtis
Simpson, CISO at Armis in a recent article on increasing attacks on
critical infrastructure. Forrester Research's Brian Kim said that
critical infrastructure organizations need to focus on identifying
vulnerable OT devices within their estate, then focus on building a
zero-trust strategy, using least privilege and network segmentation to
prevent malicious actors from gaining access to critical systems. "One
of the best ways we can reduce the impact of a breach is a zero-trust
strategy by limiting the communications of these ICS \[industrial
control systems\]," Kime said.. "We can create an allow list that only
allows communications with control systems that run a process--allowing
least privilege for network connections ... is a best practice. And
ideally, we should have a barrier between IT and OT and segment each
facility to have its own network. JFrog and Forescout research teams
will present a webinar on August 19 to provide additional information
about how these vulnerabilities were identified and how they can be
mitigated. [Critical Infrastructure Attacks on the Rise. [Last year,
there were some 65,000]{.mark} ransomware [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to the Recorded Future, a Boston-based cybersecurity firm.
[Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure present certain benefits from
the attackers' perspective]{.underline}, even if the objective of
attackers is not a payout. First, [malicious [attackers can]{.mark} gain
[access]{.mark} to these [vulnerable devices]{.mark} with ease, as OT
devices may be older [and]{.mark} lack the security protocols of newer
technologies.]{.underline} Second, [once critical operations are
affected, it can [grind operations to a halt]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Affected organizations have great incentive to pay ransomware demands
just r resume operations. "[The nature of these [vulnerabilities]{.mark}
could lead to heightened risk and [expose]{.mark} national [critical
infrastructure]{.mark} at a time [when]{.mark} the [industry is seeing
an increase in OT **attacks against** ]{.mark}**global [utilities, oil
and gas]{.mark} pipeline operators [as well as healthcare and the supply
chain,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}wrote Forescout Research Labs in
an announcement regarding the vulnerabilities. Third, access to OT
devices can always provide entrée to other systems within organizations.
"[[Once accessed, the stack becomes a]{.mark} vulnerable [entry point to
spread]{.mark} infectious malware [across]{.mark} IT
[networks]{.mark},"]{.underline} the researchers continued. Kime noted
that [attacks like the recent one on [Colonial Pipeline revealed]{.mark}
that critical infrastructure [systems are interconnected,
creating]{.mark} the opportunity for **[ripple effects]{.mark} within
these systems**]{.underline}, then across the chain to IT systems as
well. "An event like Colonial Pipeline has revealed that [**these are
more systems of systems [rather than independent, isolated
sectors]{.mark}** that operate within their own little
world,"]{.underline} Kime said. Ultimately, Kime noted, critical
infrastructure operators need to shift their perspective to enable more
thoroughgoing protection of the critical infrastructure they manage.
"There should be a strong focus among critical infrastructure on not
just security but resilience," he said.

#### Network insecurity invites catastrophic attack on infrastructure

<https://www.iotworldtoday.com/guide/striking-back-an-iot-security-guide-for-critical-infrastructure/>,
accessed 07/04/22, JCR\] \*IoT = "Internet of Things"

Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) is now a conundrum for policy
makers. Fuel deliveries, health care provision and education systems --
[it's become clear that ineffectual IoT defenses will expose sections of
infrastructure backbone. Malicious attackers have come to realize that
going after critical infrastructure can be profitable and]{.underline}
almost certainly can [have major disruptive impact.]{.underline} Now
that attackers have come to recognize this ROI from assaults on critical
infrastructure, [it becomes more imperative to shore up these resources
from attack.]{.underline} Tackling the problem necessitates rapid
provision, implementation and verification of cybersecurity resources.
The challenge is that [many vital services depend on old technology
designed for internal networks, before IoT brought new vulnerable
endpoints to the attack surface. IoT has changed infrastructure OT
security]{.underline}; malware has become pervasive enough to break into
systems and, in some cases, extort cash from victims. Hostile nations
shelter attackers, which enables the virtual plunder of enemies and
stymie any chance of prosecution. A response must be comprehensive in
scope but are complicated by the need to avoid unnecessary shutdowns,
which also cause operational damage. "[Implementing IoT in a world which
hasn't traditionally been connected can lead to improper security
hygiene and, thus, higher risk of a breach or attack]{.underline}," said
Hollie Hennessy, cybersecurity expert at analyst firm Omdia. "[A breach
could result in devastating impact on a national scale. These
industries]{.underline} now need to balance this risk, alongside the
[risk]{.underline} of [operational outage]{.underline}, while securing
and ensuring visibility [across a large, growing portfolio of connected
devices,"]{.underline}

### Impact -- Water Attacks

#### Shout out to '21 Scholars! 

#### An attack on the water supply risks contamination and disruption -- wreaking havoc on public health and services

**Maiolo, University of Calabria Professor of Hydraulic Constructions,
et al., 18**

\[Mario, Daniella Pantusa, Environmental Engineering PhD, Hamidi Aziz,

terrorist attacks,"

[Regarding water systems they are vulnerable to]{.underline} both
manmade and natural threats including, e.g. earthquakes, flood,
droughts, [terrorist attacks.]{.underline} Safe [drinking water is
central to the life of an individual and of society; a]{.underline}
drinking [water contamination incident or the denial of drinking water
services would have far-reaching public health, economic, environmental,
and psychological impacts. Other critical services such as fire
protection, healthcare, and heating and cooling processes would also be
disrupted]{.underline} by the interruption or cessation of drinking
water service, [resulting in significant consequences to the national or
regional economies]{.underline} (Department of Homeland Security & US
EPA, 2015). Therefore, the issue of the security and risk assessment of
such systems is of increasing importance. In this context, numerous
definitions exist for the variables of interest in a risk assessment
study. These variables include: event or threat, outcome, scenario,
exposure, vulnerability, consequences, risk.

Regarding vulnerability, Ezell (2007) argues that a relationship emerges
from the literature between vulnerability and risk. Vulnerability
highlights the notion of susceptibility to a scenario whereas risk
focuses on the severity of consequences to a scenario. As described in
Thomas (2006), the National Water Resource Association, NWRA (2002)
defines a vulnerability assessment as the identification of weaknesses
in security, focusing on defined threats that could compromise the
ability to provide a service, while National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (2002), defines vulnerability as the susceptibility of
resources/assets to negative impacts from threat events. Hence, a
vulnerability assessment accounts for the assets that could deter or
defray unwanted outcomes from an event and for their susceptibility to
failure. Vulnerability is defined by Haimes and Horowitz (2004) to be
the manifestation of the inherent states of a system (e.g. physical,
technical, organizational, and cultural) that can be exploited by an
adversary to cause harm or damage. [Copeland]{.underline} (2010)
[identifies the most likely "vulnerable" water systems to be the
relatively small number of water systems serving the largest populated
cities in the country.]{.underline}

The terrorist events of recent years have increased the attention on the
safety aspects of water infrastructure. In the United States, just after
September 11, 2001, the United States Congress approved a series of acts
pertaining to vulnerability assessments to assess potential threats to
such systems and to identify corrective actions. Over the years various
vulnerability assessment methodologies and tools were developed and
several studies were conducted on this issue by various institutions not
only in USA but worldwide (APWA, AMWA, NACWA, & WEF, 2007; Centre for
European Reform \[CER\], 2005; HSPDs, 2002; Istituto Superiore di
Sanità, 2005; US EPA, 2003, 2007, 2009, 2010).

[Water systems are vulnerable to a range of intentional threats
including contamination, damaged or sabotaged through physical
destruction and cyber attack.]{.underline}

[Consequences of a water contamination can be significant. A
contamination event in a water system can adversely affect the people,
the businesses, and the community it serves due to fear, loss of water
service, significant economic costs for decontamination and recovery,
and the magnitude of adverse public health effects]{.underline} (Clark &
Hakim, 2014).

[Physical damage has consequences mainly related to the interruption of
service and may also cause large economic harms.]{.underline} Vulnerable
characteristics of water systems include their physical attributes, e.g.
reservoirs, tanks, and pump stations. In addition to physical
attributes[, a water utility's SCADA could be vulnerable to cyber
attack, for example, turning pumps on or off, filling or emptying tanks
inappropriately, or causing water hammer events]{.underline} (Clark &
Hakim, 2014).

#### Contamination risks poisoning millions

[Experts said the scariest scenarios involve a hacker either
purposefully or inadvertently changing the operations of an industrial
control system, such as]{.underline} that for [a pipeline, a dam or a
water works.]{.underline}

Such [an intrusion could lead to prolonged outages, destroy
infrastructure and even kill.]{.underline}

[When]{.underline} Iranian [hackers broke into the computer system that
controls the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye Brook]{.underline}, New York, in
2013, they snooped on passwords and usernames but didn\'t seize control
of the computerized floodgates, which were disconnected for maintenance.

[They proved they could sneak]{.underline} into critical infrastructure
systems [and hijack any one of hundreds of flood control systems in the
USA, sending potentially fatal floods]{.underline} toward downriver
cities, [or wipe out hydro-electric power and water supplies to
millions.]{.underline}

Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called it a wake-up call in 2015 when
revelations about the breach became public. [The nation\'s critical
infrastructure is vulnerable to criminals and needs to be
strengthened]{.underline}, he said.

\"This cyberattack surely serves as a bucket of ice water to the face,\"
Schumer said.

But it didn\'t.

Colonial shut down its pipeline out of an abundance of caution. Hackers
locked up the company\'s corporate computer system - possibly affecting
email, billing and payroll. The criminals did not access the computer
system that controls the flow of fuel through more than 5,000 miles of
pipeline, but the company was worried that system might not be
completely separate, experts said.

\"Imagine loss of control of the pipeline itself and what could have
resulted,\" said Mark Ostrowski, head of engineering for the East Coast
at Check Point Software Technologies.

Water

[An intrusion into the Oldsmar, Florida, water system in February
highlighted vulnerabilities]{.underline} in the water treatment
industry.

[A hacker broke in through remote access software and briefly increased
the amount of sodium hydroxide]{.underline} from 100 parts per million
to 11,100 parts per million. [Sodium hydroxide]{.underline}, also called
lye, [can cause irritation, burns and other complications in too large
quantities.]{.underline}

A supervisor noticed the tampering - he could see the intruder moving a
cursor across the screen, changing settings - and intervened immediately
to reverse it. The city said sensors and other safeguards would have
caught the problem. Oldsmar, a city of 15,000 residents, is about 15
miles northwest of Tampa.

In March, the Justice Department accused a former Kansas utility worker
of remotely tampering with a public water system\'s cleaning procedures.
Last week, NBC News reported that [a hacker in January tried to poison
an unnamed water treatment plant]{.underline} serving parts [of the San
Francisco Bay Area.]{.underline}

\"[If you\'re]{.underline} a state actor or a highly integrated or
networked [group of hackers]{.underline}, Black Hat hackers, [you can
mess with the chlorine levels in your water or the arsenic levels in
your water and poison the entire New York City water supply
overnight]{.underline},\" Bolton said. \"New York City wakes up,
everyone has a glass of water in the morning or cooks something with
water in the morning - [and you poison millions of
people]{.underline}.\"

[Consequences of a sustained power outage]{.underline}

[The EMP Commission states "Should significant parts of the electrical
power infrastructure be lost for any substantial period of time, the
Commission believes that the consequences are likely to be catastrophic,
and many people will die for the lack of the basic elements necessary to
sustain life in dense urban and suburban communities]{.underline}."
\[67\].

Space [constraints preclude discussion on how the loss of the grid would
render synthesis and distribution of oil and gas inoperative.
Telecommunications would collapse, as would finance and banking.
Virtually all technology, infrastructure, and services require
electricity.]{.underline}

An EMP attack that collapses the electric power grid will collapse the
water infrastructure---the delivery and purification of water and the
removal and treatment of wastewater and sewage. Outbreaks that would
result from the failure of these systems include cholera. It is
problematic if fuel will be available to boil water. Lack of water will
cause death in 3 to 4 days \[68\].

[Food production would also collapse. Crops and livestock require water
delivered by electronically powered pumps. Tractors, harvesters, and
other farm equipment run on petroleum products supplied by an
infrastructure (pumps, pipelines) that require electricity. The plants
that make fertilizer, insecticides, and feed also require electricity.
Gas pumps that fuel the trucks that distribute food require electricity.
Food processing requires electricity.]{.underline}

In 1900, nearly 40% of the population lived on farms. That percentage is
now less than 2% \[69\]. It is through technology that 2% of the
population can feed the other 98% \[68\]. The acreage under cultivation
today is only 6% more than in 1900, yet productivity has increased 50
fold \[69\].

[As stated by Dr.]{.underline} Lowell L [Wood in Congressional
testimony:]{.underline}

["If we were no longer able to fuel our agricultural machine in the
country, the food production of the country would simply
stop]{.underline}, because we do not have the horses and mules that used
to tow agricultural gear around in the 1880s and 1890s".

"So the situation would be exceedingly adverse if both electricity and
the fuel that electricity moves around the country......... stayed away
for a substantial period of time, we would miss the harvest, and we
would starve the following winter" \[70\].

[People can live for 1--2 months without food, but after 5 days, they
have difficulty thinking and at 2 weeks they are
incapacitated]{.underline} \[68\]. There is typically a 30-day
perishable food supply at regional warehouses but most would be
destroyed with the loss of refrigeration \[69\]. The EMP Commission has
suggested food be stockpiled for a possible EMP event.

Over the past decade, [Allies have identified a steep increase in cyber
activities targeting the critical infrastructure sectors that NATO
military operations rely upon.]{.underline} Directly or indirectly,
[these malicious cyber activities can also disrupt the Alliance's
logistics and forward operations.]{.underline} [NATO's commitment to
"operate and defend itself "5 in the cyber domain]{.underline} as
effectively as in the geographic domains came, thus, as a direct
recognition of cyber as a hybrid threat to both the Allies and the
Alliance. Compared to the air, land and sea domains, [the cyber domain
is not constrained by national borders]{.underline} (although certain
physical aspects of it might be located within them). This distinction
between the cyber and the geographic domains is important to note,
because NATO was founded in response to external military threats
without the right to intervene in internal security matters, where
member states maintain the monopoly over the use of force. [In the cyber
domain, the distinction between internal and external security threats
is harder to ascertain]{.underline}. [When integrating offensive cyber
capabilities into its defence and deterrence mandate, NATO would
inevitably tackle certain aspects inherent to internal
security]{.underline}; [and yet, not legally infringe on the sovereignty
of the Allies as long as effects amounting to force or intervention are
not employed against the physical systems residing in these
nations]{.underline}.6 Operating in the cyber domain requires, thus,
that [member states better integrate their offensive cyber capabilities
into NATO operations not just to win future wars, but also to avoid
elements of friction between Allies, which may arise from unilateral
cyber effects to defend critical infrastructure.]{.underline}

\*EW- electronic warfare

While they can offer some advantages in military operations,
[cyberattacks also have limitations in feasi- bility and effect. In the
event of military attacks, military objectives can be supported by
intelligence-gathering operations, operations aimed at disrupting the
oppo- nent's military, and psychological operations against the
opponent's publi]{.underline}c.15 Nevertheless, [sophisticated
cyberattacks require a lot of luck, but also skill and
time]{.underline}---for example, the 75-minute power outage in 2016 in
Kyiv took 31 months to prepare.16

The Russian military exercise Zapad 2021 in September included one of
the largest uses of elec- tronic warfare, which has been increasingly on
display in eastern Ukraine since 2014 and in Syria since 2015. Roger
McDermott, a leading analyst on Russian military developments has
described that "[Russia's growing technological advances in EW
\[electronic warfare\] will allow its forces to jam, disrupt, and
interfere with NATO communications,]{.underline} radar and other sensor
systems, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other assets."17 [Russia sees EW
as a seam- less whole, ranging from kinetic combat operations on the
battlefield to missions in cyberspace and the information
domain]{.underline}.18 While there were no public sources confirming any
navigation or communica- tions disruption by the Baltic-Polish defense
leader- ship during Zapad 2021, [it is nevertheless important that NATO
continue to adapt to the evolving cyber- threat landscape.]{.underline}

[Since the end of the Cold War, radical groups, terrorist organizations
together with  intelligence agencies and military regimes that
controlled weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}, represented  the
most plausible world's threats. In the last two decades, the security
environment witnessed a  significant shift: [the world's most relevant
state actors shifted the focus from being nuclear powers  competing in
an arms race to becoming cyber powers]{.underline} [that allows much
softer tools to be employed to  achieve military
objectives]{.underline}.  

Nowadays [increasing connectivity and reliance on information technology
is a vulnerability  recognized by NATO and national security doctrine as
it is being targeted by cyber-attacks and  subversion of democratic
institutions carried out by disinformation]{.underline}. 

Just as in the traditional domains, [cyber threats for NATO are emerging
from a wide range of  sources that include state actors]{.underline},
especially China and Russia, [but also a significant number of non state
actors,]{.underline} i[ncluding proxies and criminal organizations.
Cyber operations performed by opposite  actors are likely to target NATO
Computer & Information Systems (CIS) infrastructure and data bases  to
affect the communications' confidentiality, reliability or availability

attack]{.underline} the [adversary's dual-use C3I]{.underline}
\[command, control, communication and intelligence\] capabilities [to
undermine]{.underline} its [nonnuclear operation]{.underline}s'.117 [An
attack on]{.underline} a [dual-use C3 asset would]{.underline}
particularly [hold strong incentives for adversaries possessing nuclear
weapons and]{.underline} not ruling out [their potential
use]{.underline}. For instance, a cyberattack on early warning
satellites will provide a tremendous advantage to the adversary by
either delaying the detection of a missile launch (conventional or
nuclear) or even preventing it from being identified in the first place.

James M. Acton addresses two [mechanisms that lead to
escalation]{.underline}.118 [First]{.underline} is a '[misinterpreted
warning']{.underline}, probably at a time of crisis, [where a state's
dual-use C3 assets]{.underline} are [targeted by conventional weapons or
cyber interferences]{.underline} and the target state might
[misinterpre]{.underline}t these attacks [as]{.underline} 'preparations
for an [incoming use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}' by their
adversary.119 The targeted state might miscalculate and respond in a
highly escalatory way that leads to full-scale conventional or nuclear
war. [Second]{.underline}, [if]{.underline} a state's [C3]{.underline}
capability was [attacked by conventional means]{.underline}, [it might
lose its advantage to destroy an adversary's nuclear weapon
systems]{.underline}. In order [to prevent]{.underline} such [a
situation happening]{.underline}, the [state might use pre-emptive
countermeasures that]{.underline} would themselves [lead to
escalation]{.underline},120 thus [adding nuclear 'use it or lose it'
pressures to conventional crises.]{.underline}

It is important to note that the escalation mechanisms identified by
Acton rest on hypothetical situations in which states that have been
forced, for the purposes of the argument, into adopting an inherently
escalatory posture; in reality, this may not be the inevitable outcome.
The role of [conventional forces and cyber interference]{.underline}s is
highlighted [primarily and under specific conditions as]{.underline} a
route to [escalation]{.underline}, [rather]{.underline}
[than]{.underline} also as a source of potential
[de-escalation]{.underline}. Although [risks of escalation through
entanglement might be greater]{.underline} in some cases, [it is hard to
judge]{.underline} a s[tate]{.underline}'s possible
[actions]{.underline} only [by]{.underline} [counting]{.underline} its
[conventional or nuclear capabilities]{.underline} [or]{.underline} by
[assigning an escalatory role]{.underline} to them. [Escalation is a
choice]{.underline}, and the logic of escalation mechanisms removes the
factor of human agency for conflict avoidance. [Ultimately, survival of
a state may not]{.underline}, in all instances, be [link]{.underline}ed
[to]{.underline} the [survival of its nuclear forces.]{.underline}

#### Risk of escalation to global nuclear war is high

Not hundred per cent of the dialogue has been frozen, fortunately.
Certain informal, mostly offthe-record, meetings of US and Russian
experts on cyber agenda continue taking place, both through Track 2 and
Track 1.5. One of the most intellectually stimulating meetings, with
frank exchanges, took place in Vienna in December 2018. The report
produced after the meeting stressed "[[the significant risk]{.underline}
\[...\] [that cyber-attacks could]{.underline}]{.mark} [conceivably
[lead to]{.mark} a military [escalation that]{.mark} **may further
[trigger a nuclear]{.mark} weapons [exchange]{.mark}**, a fact that
[became]{.mark} more [explicit with]{.mark} the adoption of [the current
N]{.mark}uclear [P]{.mark}osture [R]{.mark}eview.]{.underline} This
issue gets complicated given that [**[third parties]{.mark} may
[have]{.mark} the [capabilities to invoke]{.mark} a cyber
[conflict]{.mark}** [between Russia and the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} Whether a country or [[a non-state
actor]{.mark}, they [could put the two countries on the verge]{.mark} of
an armed conflict [by **attacking critical infrastructure**]{.mark} of
either of them and making it look as if the aggressor were the other
one]{.underline}"\[22\]. However, one should have no illusion: such
informal meetings may be fully fruitful only when their reports and
policy recommendations are utilized by the governments. And for that, a
warmer climate in bilateral relations is a must. So far, we see exactly
the opposite: mercury falling to freezing levels. [Risk of [**cyber
clashes growing into a chaotic global cyber war** has been emphasized by
the UN]{.mark}]{.underline} Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in his
Agenda for Disarmament: "[Malicious acts in cyberspace are contributing
to diminishing trust among States]{.underline}... States should
implement the recommendations elaborated under the auspices of the
General Assembly, which aim at building international confidence and
greater responsibility in the use of cyberspace.\[23\]" However, as the
members of the US-Russian Track 1.5 working group on strategic stability
recently concluded, "without a constructive dialogue on cyber issues
between the United States and Russia, the [world would most likely fail
to agree on any norms of responsible behavior of states in cyber
space]{.underline}"\[24\]. Do we really have to survive a cyber
equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis to realize the importance of
achieving some kind of agreement on cyber issues, and on the broader
agenda of international information security?\[25\] Or is that kind of
talk plain old alarmism? I don't want to sound a fatalist, but I am even
less keen on sounding like an ostrich that's buried its head in the
sand. [We cannot ignore the obvious: whether the world's most powerful
actors like it or not, [the **world is sliding to another major
crisis**]{.mark} like the one in 1962.]{.underline} The cyber war is
already raging. There are no rules of engagement in that war. [The
[uncertainty is high. The **spiral of tension is getting out of
control.**]{.mark} The cyber arms race is gaining momentum.]{.underline}
And [[there are no guarantees **that the next crisis will be
controllable**]{.underline}]{.mark}, or that it will result in a
catharsis as far as international information security regulation is
concerned. [There's no telling what will happen once the cyber genie is
out of the bottle.]{.underline}

### Impact - Cyber warfare

#### Cyberwarfare causes collateral damage that outrides conventional 

**Bonefeld-Dahl**, Director General of DIGITALEUROPE, **2022**

(Cecilia, "Preparing Europe for cyberwarfare," The Parliament Magazine,

\*ICT = Information and Communication Technology

The [invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} [shows]{.underline} why [we must
be serious about building Europe\'s digital shield]{.underline}.
[Cybersecurity must no longer be seen as a secondary
concern]{.underline}. [It is essential that we use all available tools
and resources to protect ourselves]{.underline}.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, but the war had begun many
years earlier. Since at least 2014, there has been an almost constant
barrage of cyber-attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure.

One example is the \'NotPetya\' ransomware attack of 2017, which
resulted in over 2000 attacks across the world. Microsoft Defender
Security Research estimated that the vast majority of infections hit
Ukraine. One of the major targets was the National Bank of Ukraine, as
well as government ministries, transport systems and, worryingly, the
Chernobyl radiation monitoring system.

As well as destabilising Ukraine, [the]{.underline} [collateral damage
was huge]{.underline}. According to Wired, the White House put the final
figure on the damage at \$10 billion. Both the UK and US attributed the
attacks to the Russian security services, and the EU levied sanctions
against individuals in Russia suspected to be involved.

As we have now seen, [cyberwarfare can outride traditional
warfare]{.underline}. [By breaking into the ICT systems of ministries,
hospitals, media outlets and other critical infrastructure]{.underline},
[cyber-attacks can grind government business to a halt, disrupt vital
supplies and sow confusion]{.underline}.

### AT: Squo solves -- national cybersecurity efforts sufficient

#### Cooperation between NATO nations is key for cybersecurity- NATO facilitates development, information sharing, and better protected networks. 

**Ackerman 20**

(Robert Ackerman, Retired Editor in Chief, SIGNAL Magazine, and Senior
Director, SIGNAL Media; former war correspondent at AFCEA International,
graduated from Boston University in communications, "NATO Expands
Cybersecurity Activities" Signal Magazine, May 2020, Proquest, accessed
6/29 GDI- TMK)

From partnerships with industry to dual-use Al cyber capabilities, the
alliance is playing the field. NATO is doubling down on cyberspace
defense with increased partnerships and new technology thrusts.
Information exchanges on threats and solutions, coupled with research
into exotic capabilities such as artificial intelligence, are part of
alliance efforts to secure its own networks and aid allies in the
cybersecurity fight. [The threats the alliance networks face constitute
relatively the same ones confronting other organizations. NATO faces the
double challenge of securing its own networks and information assets, as
well as helping its member nations improve their own national cyber
resilience. In the past, NATO viewed cybersecurity as somewhat of a
technical challenge. But that perspective evolved over time as the
cyberscape underwent changes.]{.underline} This came less from choice
and more of necessity as a result of the amount and content of malicious
cyber activity, explains Christian Liflander, head of section, Cyber
Defense, Emerging Challenges Division, NATO. NATO does not have any
tanks, ships or aircraft, with a few exceptions such as the AWACS
aircraft operated from Geilenkirchen Air Base in Germany. However[, when
it comes to cyber defense, NATO has its own capability that defends its
networks and maintains their operation in the face of adversarial
actions. Unlike combat forces, cyber defenders are all NATO staff
members.]{.underline} [This force is not dependent on individuals loaned
from member nations. Instead, it staffs its own personnel to form a core
of cybersecurity expertise]{.underline}. One constant over the next few
years will be the need to remain resilient, Liflander states. NATO
networks must be built and operated in ways that deny benefits to cyber
attackers. This includes NATO being able to run networks in a degraded
environment. Yet this is easier said than done, he offers. [While NATO
will continuously work to improve its cyber defense, its adversaries
also will become more sophisticated and capable.]{.underline} \"The
changing threat landscape will continue to challenge us,\" Liflander
says. \"I don\'t really think there will be an endpoint where we can
declare mission accomplished,\" he states. \"It is a continuous task, a
continuous mission, making sure that networks are well-defended.\" The
alliance is looking to manage risk differently, he offers. \"It\'s not
only a technical risk that we\'re looking at; it\'s a risk to a
mission.\" [The alliance must be certain that an operational commander
is able to operate in cyberspace with the same freedom of maneuver
available on land, at sea and in the air.]{.underline} National
cybersecurity resilience also presents the dichotomy of continuity and
change. Member nations often face threats to their critical
infrastructure or other soft elements in addition to hardened government
networks. Attackers can be nation-states, organized criminals,
individual hacktivists or even those working as proxies, although the
vast majority of attacks are nonstate activities such as ransomware.
[\"NATO\'s role in helping allies improve national resilience will
become even more critical,\"]{.underline} Liflander offers. And NATO is
no different in terms of potential threats to its networks[. The
alliance is looking at issues such as military supply chains, training
and education, situational awareness and resourcing cyber
defense]{.underline}. But Liflander emphasizes that NATO does not want
to fall into the trap of viewing cybersecurity as simply a technology
issue. This brings into play training and cyber hygiene, he notes.
[Neither the alliance nor its member nations have unlimited resources
for cyber defense, so they must ensure that their resources are applied
effectively]{.underline}, Liflander notes[. NATO will serve as an
important facilitator for allies as they develop their national cyber
capabilities. \"It starts with resources. If you\'re not spending
resources, you\'re not going to improve,\"]{.underline} he declares.
Liflander offers [that NATO is one of the most sophisticated cyber
actors among international organizations, and that comes from both its
mandate and its partnered approach. \"We have quite understood that no
one, however powerful, can go it alone,\"]{.underline} he declares.
\"[You need to cooperate. That\'s a prerequisite in order to do your job
well.\" NATO\'s network has a global footprint, and the alliance is
responsible for its cyber defense. The member nations are responsible
for their own national networks]{.underline}. But, Liflander points
out[, dedicated cyber attackers do not necessarily differentiate between
the two types. Depending on vulnerabilities, they can be exploited in
both sets of networks]{.underline}, he says. [Cybersecurity among NATO
and its members is almost symbiotic, he continues. Malicious activity
that takes place in NATO\'s network almost certainly can be found in
individual nations\' networks, which increases the importance of
information sharing among the allies. Such malicious cyber activity can
target military aspects as well as have effects on the civilian critical
infrastructure. Because of these linkages between military and civilian
spheres, NATO is working on critical infrastructure protection,
including telecommunications. \"Not making sure that your national
networks are well-defended can create and introduce a vulnerability that
can also be exploited for political purposes,]{.underline}\" Liflander
offers[. \"It can undermine unity or allied cohesion for some other
purposes.\"]{.underline}

### NATO response Ukraine -- key to Taiwan 

#### International leadership on Ukraine key to Taiwan sovereignty -- cooperation and planning over Ukraine spillover

ON THE CLOCK

[The need for a new world order is apparent, and policymakers are
already at work trying to address the evident failures of the existing
system.]{.underline} In doing so, they have again invoked values and
philosophies. Biden, for instance, has described the war in Ukraine and
tensions with China as part of "an ongoing battle in the world between
democracy and autocracy." French President Emmanuel Macron declared that
Russia's invasion had called democracy "into question before our eyes."

[Yet the best, most unifying organizing principle for what will be the
fourth system of world order is practical problem solving]{.underline}.
It's convenient to perceive the world as apportioned into democracies
and autocracies, but it is also self-regarding and divisive. [People are
more likely to come together around problems that command wide interest
and embrace corrective actions that require wide
participation.]{.underline} After years of theatrics that have resulted
in catastrophes and growing fear, [the system can no longer afford to
place inclusiveness and symbolism ahead of teamwork and
results.]{.underline}

[To erect a new system, policymakers should start by addressing the most
pressing current crisis: Ukraine.]{.underline} [The military issues are
already receiving intense attention. Yet economic issues may determine
the outcome of the war as Russia tries to break not just Ukraine's armed
forces]{.underline} [bu]{.underline}t its hope for a better
[future]{.underline}. The G-7 and allied countries must prepare a
far-reaching strategy of Ukrainian reconstruction, tied to the ongoing
process of EU accession for Ukraine and funded in part by frozen Russian
state and state-related assets. Such an action, with expert assistance
from EU staff and hundreds of billions of dollars in reconstruction aid,
would be a peaceful counteroffensive on an epic scale. Ultimately, it
would help Ukrainians believe and see that they can have a better
future.

[But to address the challenges Russia has created, the free world can't
focus only on Ukraine]{.underline}. Unless a fundamental change occurs
in Moscow, [the United States and Europe will also have to redefine
their defense for the 2020s, from the Arctic to the Mediterranean (a
process already underway), to deter further aggression.]{.underline} And
sadly, when a leader such as Putin makes ominous threats about
escalation, [the United States and its friends must develop credible
plans for a wider war with Russia.]{.underline}

For this new system to succeed at keeping the peace[, the responsible
countries will also need to engage in military planning beyond
Europe.]{.underline} For example, [the war in Ukraine affects diplomatic
calculations on all sides of the dispute over Taiwan's
sovereignt]{.underline}y. Because of the international response to aid
Ukraine, Beijing can see that Japan, the United States, and other
countries now feel much greater pressure to defend Taiwan. It is now
harder for China to sustain the fiction that it can peacefully reunify
the island with the mainland. [The free world's ability to defend Taiwan
has long involved considerable pretense, but the war in Ukraine has also
revealed that well-prepared global economic action may be a more
powerful and less provocative way to deter conflict than reliance on
more traditional military tools.]{.underline} China should see that
Japan and others around the world are preparing for the possible
financial and commercial earthquake that would immediately accompany a
war with the United States and Japan over Taiwan.

In light of such current global conditions, especially after the Ukraine
war, it becomes difficult for us to be very optimistic about the
possibility of achieving significant progress on any issue between the
two parties. However, [it will be possible for the United
States]{.underline} of America [and China to conclude some agreements,
especially]{.underline} if they will be in the interest of the two
countries [after the deterioration in the global economy]{.underline}
after the Russian war against Ukraine.

  Hence, [Beijing is carefully studying the reaction of the
international community to the Russian invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine.
[It is certain that China will analyze the most prominent aspects of the
benefits of Russian military operations in Ukraine, in order to benefit
from this in its strategy towards Taiwan.]{.underline}

 [The most important thing to me is the Chinese insistence on monitoring
and analyzing the extent of the unity and cohesion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) and other American alliances]{.underline}, as
well as the extent to which the alliance and Western countries are able
to bear the consequences and costs of sanctions on Russia.

[ ]{.underline}Here, we find that China is trying to monitor and analyze
all the course of the war in Ukraine, and [the Chinese analysis on (the
most prominent defensive military roles of the "US Pentagon" and NATO
after the Ukraine war, and the impact of (combining misinformation and
the US cyber-attacks on the ground), then the Chinese focus on this
relationship,]{.underline} [due to the extent and scope of the formation
of the defense and military positions]{.underline} of the US Department
of Defense "the Pentagon" and the military alliance of NATO [towards
directing the future conflict of linking and the relationship between
Ukraine and Taiwan, and their influence on China.]{.underline}

  [China i]{.underline}s well [aware]{.underline} of the most important
and most prominent ([logistical differences between Moscow's invasion of
Ukraine and any possible attack it might have made in its efforts to
annex Taiwan]{.underline}). Here, I can analyze China's assertive
position, that it cannot invade Taiwan's borders in a scenario similar
to the Russian army's incursion into Ukrainian territory. Where China
will work to search where the opportunity lies and how to take advantage
of the Ukrainian crisis. Here, [China will try to achieve balance in its
dealings with the developments of events in Ukraine.]{.underline}

[ Therefore, China is also trying to play (the role of neutrality
Diplomacy regarding the burning crisis between Russia and Ukraine), and
it is not expected that China will act in the same way that Russia
did]{.underline}.  Ukraine.

 

### AT: China not a cyber military threat 

#### Even Chinese espionage targeting US businesses tied to undermining US military advantages

Essential to Forming Desired Norms in Cyberspace," Cyber Defense Review,

THE SITUATION

The US National Cyber Strategy published in 2018 envisions an open,
reliable, and secure cy- berspace, one that supports American
prosperity, liberty, and security.\[11\] The key to realizing this
vision is accepting cyber norms that "define acceptable behavior to all
states and promote greater predictability and stability in
cyberspace"\[12\] and that "attribute and deter unacceptable behavior in
cyberspace."\[13\] The accompanying 2018 Department of Defense (DoD)
strategy emphasizes long-term strategic competition from the People's
Republic of China (PRC), which has "expanded that competition to include
persistent campaigns in and through cyberspace that pose long-term
strategic risk to the Nation as well as to our allies and
partners."\[14\] The DoD strategy further notes that, "China is eroding
US military overmatch and the Nation's economic vitality by persistently
exfiltrating sensitive information from US public and private sector
institutions."\[15\]

[Aligning National Cyber Strategy goals with DoD's characterization of
the threat requires an assessment of unacceptable PRC
behavior]{.underline}. [It is critical to note that DoD characterized
PRC's espionage as the persistent exfiltration of sensitive information,
which sought to damage US in- terests: through the erosion of US
military overmatch and the erosion of US economic vitality.]{.underline}

Eroding US military overmatch is obviously a serious concern, but
[espionage with the intent to understand and neutralize military
advantages has been accepted normative behavior]{.underline} since at
least as early as Sun Tzu in the 5th Century, BCE.\[16\]

[It is not espionage itself that is the relevant issue here; rather, it
is the intent to erode US economic vitality.]{.underline} This is
precisely the issue that President Obama raised with President Xi in the
2015 agreement: espionage "with the intent of providing competitive
advantages to com- panies or commercial sectors,"\[17\] hereafter
referred to as intellectual property-theft (IP-theft).

[The tension between the United States]{.underline} of America [and
China does not depend on geopolitical issues,]{.underline} especially in
Taiwan and the South China Sea, as [other issues, such as: (electronic
security and cyber technology), are among one of the most prominent
manifestations]{.underline} of tension between the two countries as well
and cast a shadow on other features of political and economic
competition and strategy between the two sides. [The United States of
America accused China of being behind several (electronic attacks and
massive data breaches targeting American institutions and economic
entities).]{.underline} Therefore, the United States of America linked
this with opposition to China's leadership in the communication
technology of Chinese G5 networks. [Therefore, it is expected that the
US will continue to seek to limit Chinese technology
markets]{.underline} and isolate them from the rest of the world,
especially with Washington continuing to put obstacles in the way of
Chinese companies obtaining industrial components and important
American-made devices. [The United States]{.underline} of America
[has]{.underline} already [begun to implement stricter restrictions on
technology transfer]{.underline} to China, so expectations indicate that
more American restrictions will be imposed on China. And the US
Department of Defense ([the Pentagon]{.underline}) [is
working,]{.underline} starting from this year in 2022, [to fill all the
regulatory loopholes that allowed the well-known Chinese company to
manufacture semiconductors]{.underline}, known as the "Semi Conductor "
company. And that Chinese company, which is the largest chip maker in
China, has purchased important American technology. [We find that
Chinese companies and economic entities are likely to be added to the
blacklist of the US Department of Commerce]{.underline}, with
discussions on export controls between the United States and its allies
as well as scrutiny of foreign direct investment issues in China.
[During the year of 2020, China launched a campaign targeting major
technology companies]{.underline}, including the Chinese e-commerce
giant "Alibaba", "Tencent" and major real estate companies, such as
"Evergrand and Kisa", and others. [Here, we see that these Chinese and
American measures will negatively affect foreign investment in Chinese
companies]{.underline}, which will make international investors in a
state of complete caution. [After the Ukraine war, it is expected that
the Chinese, American, and global economy will (witness a significant
slowdown in the coming period. According to my estimation, the decline
in global growth will exacerbate tensions between the two
parties).]{.underline}

## Great Power War \[Russia and China\]

### US key -- cooperation 

#### US fostered cybersecurity and cooperative efforts strengthen defense and deterrence against Russia and China 

**Mazarr, 2022**

National War College, \"Understanding Competition: Great Power Rivalry
in a Changing International Order---Concepts and Theories\", RAND
Coorperation, 3/1/22, JSTOR, accessed 7/4/22, GDI-cc\]

As Table 2 suggests, there are critical roles in peacetime competition
for military services doing what they have always done. This includes
training and advising, exercises, senior-leader engagements,
humanitarian response and medical aid missions, and other missions.
[This analysis therefore points to a very specific, critical, but
limited role for DoD in the contest short of war that is a part of the
larger rivalries with Russia and China. The war in Ukraine has, if
anything, underlined the importance of DoD's role in competitive
activities short of war. It was precisely these efforts---in terms of
security assistance, train and advise missions, Foreign Military Sales
and military aid deliveries, and cooperative efforts in such areas as
cyber and defense institution building---that improved Ukraine's ability
to resist Russian aggression. In cases like this, in which the United
States will not be willing or able to undertake a direct military role
in countries threatened by Russian or Chinese coercion or aggression,
peacetime support and cooperation will be the leading defense tool to
deter and respond to attacks.]{.underline}

#### Focus on Russia and China increase tools to fight terror

[Focusing on geopolitical competition with China and Russia will likely
lead NATO allies to shift resources from the fight against
terrorism]{.underline}. This structural situation requires NATO to
develop a sustainable approach to mitigate terrorist threats.
Fortunately, the [key requirements for this complement the requirements
of great power competition]{.underline}. [Both involve improving
defensive capabilities, maintaining crisis response capacity, and
continuing to enhance intelligence sharing]{.underline}. For example,
partnership structures like those used to support Ukraine since 2014 can
be used to deepen cooperation in combatting terrorism globally.
Similarly, [many of the elements inherent in great power proxy warfare
are compatible with combatting terrorism]{.underline} --- for NATO this
principally involves partner capacity building and information
operations. The [gains that NATO]{.underline}, and particularly NATO
special operations forces, [have made in coordinating the fight against
non-state adversaries will help in great power competition]{.underline},
[and their continued engagement will prevent basic counterterrorism
capabilities from withering]{.underline}. The 2022 Strategic Concept can
offer high-level political direction in support of incorporating
irregular warfare into a broader approach to deterrence and defense.

There they were, meeting in Beijing on February 4: Chinese President Xi
Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Shortly before the start
of the 2022 Winter Olympics, the two leaders released a remarkable
5,300-word joint statement about how the partnership between China and
Russia would have "no limits." The document went on at length about the
two nations' commitment to democracy. It called for a universalist and
open world order, with the United Nations at the center. It stressed a
commitment to international law, inclusiveness, and common values. It
did all this even though Russia, as Xi and Putin both knew, was sending
tanks and missile launchers to the Ukrainian border. By comparison, the
September 1940 joint statement issued by Germany, Italy, and Japan was a
model of candor. The Axis powers were at least truthful when they
announced that it was "their prime purpose to establish and maintain a
new order of things." Russia, meanwhile, has described its war against
Ukraine as one of liberation. It decided that the country's Jewish
president was a Nazi. It declared that there was really no such thing as
"Ukraine." And it argued that a NATO alliance with a U.S. force
commitment in Europe that was only one-seventh as large as it had been
at the height of the Cold War was now an existential threat. In their
statement, China and Russia achieved peak hypocrisy. [But the existing
world order, which aspired to build a global commonwealth, had already
been failing.]{.underline} The [free world's leaders]{.underline} had
long ago [started favoring performative commitments over the real
action]{.underline} needed to safeguard the planet from crises. They
[expanded NATO without meaningfully responding to increasing Russian
aggression.]{.underline} Distracted and chastened by misadventures in
the Muslim world, [Washington in particular disengaged from practical
deeds, even as its rhetorical commitment to the international order
varied]{.underline}. The United States' high defense spending had more
to do with satisfying domestic constituencies than with supporting any
positive strategy. The world's transition from fossil fuels to renewable
energy sources was based on hollow pledges and private action. [As
support for globalization waned, the United States and other countries
retreated from trade agreements and neglected international institutions
for civilian and common economic action.]{.underline} The world's drive
in the early years of this century to improve global health and human
development petered out. [The emptiness of the supposed international
system was especially obvious at the end of 2019, when the COVID-19
pandemic broke out.]{.underline} [Charged with unprecedented global
responsibilities, China and the United States stepped down, not
up]{.underline}. Beijing withheld crucial information about the
outbreak. Washington withdrew from the World Health Organization just
when it most needed U.S. leadership. Wealthy countries began a mad
scramble to develop vaccines, but they moved too slowly to create other
treatments and hoarded whatever shots and therapeutics pharmaceutical
companies could produce, leaving the rest of the world behind. The best
estimates suggest that the virus caused about 15 to 20 million deaths
and trillions of dollars of economic damage. By the spring of 2020, "for
all practical purposes the G7 ceased to exist," wrote the foreign policy
experts Colin Kahl and Thomas Wright in August 2021[. "Pandemic
politics," they continued, "ultimately dealt the final blow to the old
international order." Six months after they published those words,
Russia invaded Ukraine. It was an attack that could truly have buried
the old system, as Moscow believed it would. Yet Ukraine's inspiring
fight has helped the G-7 roar back to life.]{.underline} Its members
have [organized an economic counteroffensive]{.underline}, and they have
joined a coalition providing military aid[. Amid the wreckage of so many
past hopes, it is possible to imagine a reconstructed world order
emerging from this crisis. **But for a new system to succeed, its
would-be architects must organize actions**]{.underline}, not more
theatrics. Over the course of world history, the most powerful idealism
has usually been the idealism of what works. Today, [that means crafting
a practical international order focused on a few basic problems that
rally broad interest.]{.underline} Many leaders want to stop unprovoked
wars of aggression, especially those that might spark a third world war.
They would welcome a new vision of economic order that does not ignore
security but is also not a huckster's promise that everything can be
made at home. They would like to convert jolting energy shocks, such as
the one caused by Russia's invasion, into a managed transition to a more
carbon-free future. They want to be better prepared for the next
pandemic. And most world leaders, and even many ordinary Americans,
still hope that China will choose to be part of these solutions, not one
of the wreckers of a new international system. These aspirations may
seem modest. They do not include holding war crimes trials or spreading
democracy[. But effective common action on just these items will be an
enormous task]{.underline}. The world order is deglobalizing and
dysfunctional, facing challenges that have never been more planetary in
scope. [Leaders must craft a system focused on actually addressing these
issues rather than on striking the right pose.]{.underline}

[But nowhere has the hollowness of the current world order been more
starkly revealed than in global health]{.underline}. [After the SARS
epidemic of 2003]{.underline}, amid concerns about China's role in
informing the rest of the planet about the outbreak, the nations of [the
world]{.underline} ceremoniously [enacted a set of]{.underline}
"international health [regulations]{.underline}," which [defined the
rights and duties of states to prevent and contain international public
health dangers]{.underline}. [The outbreak of COVID-19 revealed that the
elaborate provisions for global surveillance and early warnings were a
sham]{.underline}. [The pandemic also showed that the planet's main
public health agency]{.underline}---the World Health Organization---[was
weak, and it demonstrated that the world's major powers were far too
self-interested to mount a truly global response]{.underline}. The [most
substantial investigation so far of the world's reaction to
COVID-19,]{.underline} by [an independent panel]{.underline} with access
to the WHO's staff and documents, [found it was "a preventable
disaster]{.underline}." [As they wrote, "Global political leadership was
absent."]{.underline}

[It's a conclusion that is difficult to escape.]{.underline} China's
government has blocked proper investigations into the outbreak's cause
and continues to stonewall the WHO. In his own gesture of theatrical
pretense, then U.S. President Donald Trump moved to pull his country out
of the WHO during the spring of 2020, turning the crisis into a blame
game focused on China, with the organization as an accomplice. Yet the
Trump administration had no alternative agenda for meaningful global
action. Its acclaimed vaccine development program encouraged an "every
country for itself" approach to acquisition and bypassed the challenge
of developing effective therapeutics.

[The invasion of Ukraine has also highlighted the need for more
decisive, concerted action on the world's transition to clean
energy]{.underline}. More than any other event since the Iranian
revolution of 1979[, the war spotlights the danger of relying too much
on particular supplies of fossil fuels. Europe should end its dependence
on Russian oil, gas, and coal as quickly as it can.]{.underline} At the
global level, [policymakers will need to boost fossil fuel supplies from
more dependable sources in the short term, but they should treat these
sources as "transition assets"]{.underline} (to quote the energy experts
Jason Bordoff and Meghan O'Sullivan) that will be quickly wound down as
governments embrace the transition[. The switch to greener sources will
need to include a renewed commitment to advanced forms of nuclear
energy.]{.underline}

[The energy transition will require much more concerted work to find,
extract, and process diverse and secure supplies of the minerals needed
for renewable sources]{.underline}. [Both the United States and Europe
know that they cannot let vital supply chains such as these operate
according to market forces alone]{.underline}, since these markets have
been distorted by vast Chinese state projects that operate with limited
regard for the environment and for workers[. Countries that regard each
other as secure sources---and that accept the cost burdens of
sustainable production---must form their own supply network with its own
commercial system and pricing]{.underline}. [Such a plan requires strong
international participation. No country alone can source and process the
metals needed for the transition to carbon-free energy.]{.underline}

[Such trading among partners, or "friend shoring]{.underline}," as U.S.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen put it, is far preferable to the "Buy
American" public procurement requirements that Washington has put in
place to placate protectionists. Indeed, [the United States is not
self-sufficient with regard to almost any major global
commodit]{.underline}y. In this time of crisis, Americans may be tempted
by the idea of a "Fortress America"---in which they bring all production
onshore---but that is an illusion. [The United States needs and benefits
from production chains that run through other countries, whether for
mineral resources or medical supplies]{.underline}. It needs to rebuild
export markets shriveling from past trade war rhetoric and present
interest-rate policies that boost an overvalued dollar. [The best way to
cope with deglobalization is to reglobalize among friends. As major
firms operating around the world rethink their business models, the free
world should create structures to help these companies see new
opportunities.]{.underline}

[In the first decades after World War II, many U.S. military and
political leaders, and much of the public, expected or feared that
nuclear weapons would be used again.]{.underline} Hiroshima and Nagasaki
made the horrors of atomic bombings visible for all. The notion that
nuclear war could happen at any moment permeated American society. Many
Cold War-era buildings---including schools, airports, and even
motels---were constructed with a fallout shelter in the basement. The
instruction to "duck and cover" in the event of a nuclear attack (rather
than run to a window to look out) became part of U.S. civil defense
drills that every U.S. citizen, including schoolchildren, was encouraged
to practice. Movies such as On the Beach (1959), a piece of
post-apocalyptic science fiction, depicted a world annihilated by
nuclear war. Military strategists such as Herman Kahn, one of the
historical inspirations for the madman title character of Stanley
Kubrick's classic black comedy Dr. Strangelove, proselytized about
"thinking the unthinkable"---the need to think about how we would fight
and survive a nuclear war. Events such as the Cuban missile crisis made
these fears palpably real. For 13 days in October 1962, the world came
the closest it ever has to nuclear war. Many people at the time believed
the world was about to end in mushroom clouds. [Yet, during the same
period, norms of restraint developed. A nuclear taboo---a normative
inhibition against the first use of nuclear weapons---emerged as the
result of both strategic interests and moral concerns]{.underline}. A
global grassroots anti-nuclear movement, along with nonnuclear states
and the United Nations, actively sought to stigmatize nuclear weapons as
unacceptable weapons of mass destruction. After the scare of the Cuban
missile crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union also pursued arms
control agreements to help stabilize the "balance of terror[." These
norms of nuclear restraint helped foster the now nearly 77-year
tradition of nonuse of nuclear weapons, the single-most important
feature of the nuclear age.]{.underline} But today, [most of these arms
control agreements have been torn up, and nuclear-armed states are once
again engaged in costly arms races. We are in a period of nuclear excess
rather than restraint.]{.underline} All of this brings us to the current
moment and the big question suddenly on everyone's minds: Do Russian
leaders share the nuclear taboo? [Would]{.underline} Russian President
Vladimir [Putin use a nuclear weapon in the war in Ukraine]{.underline}?
[He certainly wants the world---and in particular the United States---to
at least think he might.]{.underline} On the day he announced the
beginning of a "special military operation" in Ukraine, Putin warned
that any country that attempted to interfere in the war would face "such
consequences that you have never experienced in your history," which
many took to be a veiled nuclear threat. Other Russian officials have
made similar statements over the course of the war. [So far, it is
likely that these threats are more about deterring NATO than actual use.
Russia has apparently not increased the alert levels of its nuclear
forces but rather activated a communications system that could transmit
a launch order. Russian officials are certainly aware that any use of
nuclear weapons would bring devastating consequences for Russia and for
Putin himself, including widespread condemnation and global
opprobrium]{.underline}. As Anatoly Antonov, Russia's ambassador to the
United States, claimed in early May, "It is our country that in recent
years has persistently proposed to American colleagues to affirm that
there can be no winners in a nuclear war, thus it should never happen."
Still, [the risk that Putin would use a nuclear weapon is not zero, and
the longer the war goes on the more the risk goes up.]{.underline}

Emma Ashford: Hey, Matt. So, we're now in week three of the
Russo-Ukrainian war. It has been a surprising few weeks: European states
decided to massively increase their defense spending, the United States
just banned Russian oil imports, and---perhaps most surprisingly---the
Ukrainians have managed to drag this fight out far longer than most
observers thought possible.

Matthew Kroenig: Yes, the world has changed dramatically in the past
several weeks. I feel as if 10 years' worth of developments have been
packed into several days. I never thought, for example, I would ever see
Germany decide to more than double its defense spending.

But you overlooked what may have been the most frightening development:
[a renewed risk of nuclear war between Russia and the West.]{.underline}
Russian President Vladimir [Putin placed Russian nuclear forces on alert
for the first time since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. What do
you make of this threat?

EA: It couldn't have been a clearer signal if Putin himself had
airdropped into Ukraine and planted a giant sign saying "Keep out!" in
front of the border. Indeed, in addition to the alert, we've also had
[public statements from Putin and]{.underline} Russian Foreign Minister
Sergey [Lavrov effectively threatening nuclear retaliation if the West
intervenes further in Ukraine]{.underline}. [The Russian government is
reminding everyone in no uncertain terms that Russia is a nuclear
power.]{.underline}

MK: Indeed. As a specialist in nuclear strategy, I have to say I wasn't
at all surprised. In fact, I was predicting that the Ukraine crisis
would become a nuclear crisis several months ago.

This is [Russia's so-called "escalate to de-escalate" strategy:
threatening (and if necessary carrying out) nuclear strikes on the
assumption that the West will back down and the Kremlin can get its
way.]{.underline}

At this early stage of the crisis, I [think these threats are mostly a
bluff to get the United States and NATO to curtail their support to
Ukraine, but I do think there is a real risk of Russian nuclear use if
the war continues.]{.underline}

In March 1990, the New Yorker published a cartoon by Jack Ziegler that
captured the optimism at the end of the Cold War. The cartoon shows an
executive sitting at his desk as a worker enters the office carrying a
large bomb with fins. "Bring that H-bomb over here, will you, Tom, and
just slip it into my 'out' box," the executive says. "Sure thing, boss!"
the worker responds.

The image of putting nuclear bombs "in the outbox" was emblematic of the
hope many had that a new era of cooperation between the United States
and the former Soviet Union was emerging. The fear of a nuclear war
breaking out between the world's two superpowers receded, and many hoped
that nuclear weapons, although they would still exist, would no longer
be central to international politics. Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet
Union's last leader, declared in June 1991 that "the risk of a global
nuclear war has practically disappeared."

[Today,]{.underline} more than 30 years later, nuclear bombs are back in
the inbox. [Fear of nuclear war between the United States and Russia has
returned with a vengeance. As a result of Russia's brutal invasion of
Ukraine and Russian officials' alarming nuclear threats, the world is
closer to the use of nuclear weapons out of desperation---or by accident
or miscalculation---than at any time since the early 1980s]{.underline}.

[The Russia-Ukraine war serves]{.underline} as a harsh
r[eminde]{.underline}r of some old truths about nuclear weapons: [There
are limits to the protection nuclear deterrence provides.]{.underline}
([Usable conventional weapons may get you more protection.) In a crisis,
deterrence is vulnerable, not automatic and self-enforcing]{.underline}.

### Impact - Cyber threats - deterrence

#### Cyber undermines deterrence by distorting or degrading capabilities of conventional and nuclear forces

[Credibility lies at the crux of successful deterrence]{.underline}.
[The target must believe that the deterring state has both the
capabilities to inflict the threatening costs and the resolve to carry
out a threat]{.underline}.14 A **[deterring state must therefore develop
mechanisms for signaling credibility to the target]{.underline}**.15
Much of the Cold War deterrence literature focused on the question of
how to convey resolve, primarily because the threat to use nuclear
weapons---particularly in support of extended deterrence guarantees to
allies---lacks inherent credibility given the extraordinarily high
consequences of nuclear weapons employment in comparison to any
political objective.16 This raises questions about decisionmakers'
willingness to follow through on a nuclear threat. However, [the
credibility conundrum manifests itself differently today.]{.underline}
Specifically, [the potential for cyber operations to distort or degrade
the ability of]{.underline} conventional or even [nuclear capabilities
to work as intended could undermine the credibility of deterrence due to
a reduced capability rather than political will]{.underline}.17
Moreover, given the secret nature of cyber operations, there is likely
to be information asymmetry between the deterring state and the
ostensible target of deterrence if that target has undermined or holds
at risk the deterring state's capabilities without its knowledge.

[Recognizing the interdependence among cyber, conventional, and nuclear
domains]{.underline}, [U.S. policymakers]{.underline} [must prioritize
efforts to reduce the cyber vulnerabilities of conventional and nuclear
capabilities and ensure they are resilient to adversary action in
cyberspace]{.underline}. Cyber threats to these systems could distort or
undermine their intended uses, creating risks that these capabilities
may not be reliably employable at critical junctures. Additionally,
cyber-enabled espionage conducted against these systems could allow
adversaries to replicate cutting-edge U.S. defense technology without
comparable investments in research and development and could inform the
development of adversary offset capabilities. [Vulnerabilities such as
these have important implications for deterrence]{.underline} and
warfighting. [Deterrence postures that rely on the credible, reliable,
and effective threat to employ conventional or nuclear capabilities
could be undermined through adversary cyber operations.]{.underline}
And, if deterrence fails, cyber operations to disrupt or degrade the
functioning of kinetic weapons systems could compromise mission
assurance during crises and conflicts.

The Art of Brinkmanship

In response to this challenge, [the United States and NATO should
embrace the paradox of brinkmanship, which involves trying to prevent
war by making it hard to contain once it starts]{.underline}. In the
words of Thomas Schelling, "by arranging it so that we \[the United
States\] might have to blow up the world, we would not have to." This
involves making "threats that leave something to chance," or threats
that, once enacted, would "initiate a process that may quickly get out
of hand."

[States use tactical nuclear weapons to bid up the shared risk of
nuclear escalation in the event of a war.]{.underline} [Because tactical
nuclear weapons are less destructive than "strategic" nuclear weapons,
they are seen as more usable]{.underline} and blur the firebreak between
conventional and nuclear war. [At the same time, the use of tactical
nuclear weapons generates a higher risk of general nuclear conflict than
does the use of conventional forces, meaning that threats to use
tactical nuclear weapons early in a war increase the shared risk of
disaster. This is why states who face conventional inferiority tend to
invest more heavily in these weapons.]{.underline}

[Brinkmanship tactics also involve a trade-off between deterrence and
the risk of escalation.]{.underline} A state could employ a "minimal
brinkmanship" strategy that generates low risk of nuclear use, and if
the state lacks the conventional strength to deny the adversary its
objectives in a war, this could incentivize the adversary to attack. On
the other hand, a state could enact a "maximum brinkmanship" strategy
that generates high risk for nuclear war in the event of a conflict, but
that high risk could generate restraint on the part of the adversary.
The United States used a form of maximum brinkmanship in the 1958--59
Berlin Crisis by threatening escalation to nuclear use very early in a
war over Berlin. As one of Daniel Ellsberg's colleagues described that
strategy to him: "We send in a series of increasingly larger probes. If
they're all stopped, we fire a \[nuclear\] warning shot. If that doesn't
work, we blow up the world."

[The degree of brinkmanship in a state's defense strategy lies on a
scale from the minimum to the maximum end. Where a state's strategy
should fall on the scale depends on the adversary's intentions and
capabilities.]{.underline} [Against an adversary with conventional
inferiority, it makes little sense to run a higher risk of nuclear war.
For an adversary with aggressive motivations, the risks of maximum
brinkmanship may be justified.]{.underline} However, [if an adversary is
not planning on using force, a maximum brinkmanship strategy could make
them feel insecure and prompt them to launch the attack that the state
was attempting to deter.]{.underline}

Brinkmanship in the Baltics

[What kind of adversary does NATO face in Moscow]{.underline}? The
answer depends on the outcome of the current conflict. [Based on current
developments, it seems all too likely the result will be an aggravated
Russia that is stuck in a grinding war in Ukraine]{.underline}. After
six weeks of fighting, the Russian advance in Ukraine has stalled. This
slow progress has prompted Russian forces to resort to horrific
indiscriminate violence against civilians in these areas. At this
moment, a quick victory toppling the Ukrainian government and leading to
an emboldened Russia looks unlikely.

[At the same time, Russia is unlikely to accept defeat in Ukraine
anytime soon]{.underline}. Reports came out on March 29 that Ukraine and
Russia were making progress on peace talks, but Russia's lead negotiator
Vladimir Medinsky stressed that there was "still a long way to go"
before Russia would agree to a ceasefire. Instead, Russia appears to
have changed its war aims from taking Kyiv to consolidating control over
eastern Ukraine. Fighting for this objective is likely to be costly and
raises the probability that this war will be a protracted conflict.
Western sanctions against Russia will remain in place during the war,
and Western countries will continue to provide assistance to Ukrainian
armed forces. That assistance will flow through Eastern European member
states.

[To break out of a stalemated war and achieve victory, Putin could try
to target supplies in transit while they are still in an Eastern
European NATO country, especially Poland. Putin could also conduct a
limited attack against a Baltic State in order to take territory that is
majority Russian-speaking]{.underline}. That could bolster his claim of
defending Russian speakers abroad. He may be incentivized to do this if
the economic sanctions prove too harsh on the Russian economy, and he
sees no way out of the crisis except by expanding the war. That pathway
to escalation is similar to Imperial Japan's rationale for attacking
Pearl Harbor in 1941.

[This scenario poses a serious test for deterrence for
NAT]{.underline}O. A strike on supplies going to Ukraine would be
difficult to defend against, and Russian forces could overwhelm the NATO
forces assigned to an initial defense of the Baltics. [**The best
response to the threat of these scenarios is to prevent them from
happening in the first place. To do that, a modest degree of
brinkmanship could prove effective.** Here, the United States and NATO
should alter their nuclear posture and declaratory policy to allow for
asymmetric escalation.]{.underline}

[The United States and NATO have reciprocated neither the discourse of
Russian officials (nuclear threats) nor the claimed behavior (enhanced
readiness of nuclear arsenals) but rather have funneled vast amounts of
conventional weapons to Ukraine]{.underline} while promising to pursue
accountability for Russian war crimes. Despite scattered calls in the
United States for the creation of a "no-fly zone" over some or all of
Ukraine, the Biden administration wisely resisted. In practice, this
would mean shooting down Russian planes and risk igniting World War III.
Yet[, as the war drags on, the United States may be sleepwalking into an
expanded---and therefore more dangerous---war.]{.underline} Russia's
weak military performance has tempted defense hawks and unrequited Cold
Warriors to shift the goals from simply helping to prevent Ukraine's
defeat to, as U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin suggested on April 25,
creating a "weakened" Russia. An alarming number of foreign-policy
commentators, including retired U.S. military officers and NATO
supporters who should know better, have cavalierly urged the Biden
administration to get much more aggressive in helping Ukraine or even
pursue total victory, despite the risk of nuclear escalation. [Using the
war to reassert U.S. hegemony is a dangerous game. There is a whiff of
nuclear forgetting in the air.]{.underline} One reason the Cold War
remained cold was that U.S. leaders recognized that confronting a
nuclear-armed adversary imposes constraints on action. When the Soviet
Union invaded Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, the United
States refrained from responding with military force. [Yet today there
is an entire generation (or more) of people for whom the scary realities
of the Cold War and "duck and cover" are the stuff of history books,
rather than lived experience.]{.underline} As the historian Daniel
Immerwahr wrote recently, "This is the first decade when not a single
head of a nuclear state can remember Hiroshima." [In making nuclear
dangers vivid again, the Russia-Ukraine war reminds us of not just the
benefits but also the significant risks and limits of nuclear
deterrence. Deterrence has likely kept Russia from expanding the war to
NATO countries such as Poland and Romania. Russia's nuclear arsenal has
kept NATO from intervening directly, but it has also failed to help
Russia take or hold significant territory]{.underline} in Ukraine or
compel Kyiv to surrender. Most importantly, [the war reminds us that
controlling escalation is a giant unknown. We have no idea what would
happen if a nuclear weapon were actually used. The war also reminds us
that norms are ultimately breakable]{.underline}. In the last few years,
numerous norms that we once thought were robust have been undermined.
Norms of democracy are under siege in the United States and elsewhere.
Internationally, states have eroded norms of territorial integrity,
multilateralism, arms control, and humanitarian law. [The nuclear taboo,
while widely shared, is more fragile than other Some might argue that
the taboo and deterrence are robust because no rational leader would see
a benefit to starting a nuclear war]{.underline}. The prominent
international relations realist Kenneth Waltz, a proponent of nuclear
deterrence, famously wrote that nuclear weapons create "strong
incentives to use them responsibly." [The problem is that, even if true
some of the time, this may not always be true. Not all leaders may be
rational or responsible. This view also overlooks the possibility that
nuclear war could begin through accident, misperception, or
miscalculation. In short, the nuclear taboo and deterrence are always at
risk.]{.underline}

stationing large contingents as close as possible to Russia and
Russian-controlled territory.

[The problem with forward defense, however, is that while it sounds
good, it is not clear what it would mean in practice, or how it would
play out against the many divergences and disagreements between NATO
members. Instead, allies should embrace a strategy of
confidence-building defense]{.underline}. To revive this late Cold War
concept, [NATO's eastern members would create a highly mobile net of
dispersed artillery, while more powerful European allies would build and
supply heavy weapons depots in those countries, then prepare to rapidly
deploy significant forces in case of a crisis. This approach would
enable European allies to contribute to their own security, lessen
first-strike pressures, and avoid deepening a dangerous new security
dilemma with Russia.]{.underline}

Risk to the Baltics

[The goal for the United States and its NATO allies should be to protect
Eastern European countries such as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and
Poland from a Russian attack. Eastern European NATO
countries]{.underline}, especially the Baltic states, [do not have the
capabilities to do this on their own]{.underline}. [The Russian military
is performing poorly]{.underline} in the initial phase of the war in
Ukraine, but this [should not be taken as evidence that NATO
countries]{.underline} in Eastern Europe [have adequate capabilities for
conventional defense]{.underline}. Indeed, these countries may fare
worse against a Russian invasion than Ukraine has done, as their
militaries are smaller than the Ukrainian military. Plus, the Russian
operation in Ukraine appears to have been informed by wildly optimistic
assumptions that the Ukrainians lacked the will to put up a fight and
that resistance would crumble in short order. This could be why the
first phase of the Russian invasion used only a fraction of the
190,000-strong force it amassed around Ukraine. The United States and
NATO should expect that a Russian attack on a NATO country would have
different assumptions and go differently, perhaps with Russia using many
more of its forces in the opening phase of the campaign.

[Many Russian forces are bogged down in Ukraine, but Russia still has
the conventional strength to expand the current war into NATO
territory]{.underline}. For example, [Russia could leverage its strength
in conventional long-range strike to attack convoys of supplies going
into Ukraine]{.underline}. Indeed, this is something that Russia has
recently threatened to do. Furthermore, Russia could try to hold
territorial gains in eastern and southern Ukraine instead of fighting
offensive missions to take more territory. [A new "defensive" focus in
Ukraine could free more Russian forces for an attack on an Eastern
European NATO country]{.underline}. [In short, Russia still has the
capability to conduct strikes against NATO allies and to turn the focus
of its combat power on them should it choose to do so.]{.underline}

[After Russia's invasion of Ukraine, European NATO allies are now likely
to increase investments in their armed forces that could make a
successful conventional defense possible in the future]{.underline}.
Germany's decision to double its defense budget is telling in this
regard. [NATO's increase in troops deployed to Eastern Europe is also a
positive recent development. But these developments will take time to
bear fruit.]{.underline}

Currently, [NATO's defense of the Baltics hinges on the threat of
responding to a Russian attack with its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}.
[But Putin's recent nuclear saber-rattling suggests he may not find this
threat credible and believes Washington will back down rather than risk
nuclear war]{.underline}. Indeed, even during the Cold War, it was
difficult enough to convince the Soviet Union that the United States
would trade Berlin for Boston. Expanding the alliance has only
heightened this challenge. How can the United States make Putin believe
that it is willing to trade Vilnius for New York?

EA: It's funny you should mention "escalate to de-escalate." [Though a
favorite of Washington defense planners---perhaps because it justifies
having a larger, more diverse nuclear arsenal---military analysts who
focus on Russia largely argue that there is no such concept in Russian
military doctrine. The only Russian work that actually proposes an
escalate-to-de-escalate policy was an article in a military
journal]{.underline}, and there were a few muddled official statements.
[This position was never confirmed or followed up on in official
government writing or doctrine. There's no formal evidence that the
Russians have such a policy]{.underline}, [and there's certainly no
incentive to keep it quiet if they do have one.]{.underline} I remain
unconvinced.

MK: Oh boy, where to begin. First, I have never met anyone who harbors
the goal of building more nukes for fun and is just going around looking
for excuses to do so. [Those, like me, who support the United States
having flexible nuclear options for Russia do so because they see a real
threat against which the country must defend.]{.underline}

Second, [the U.S. government]{.underline}, including in the 2018 Nuclear
Posture Review, [states that Russia has such a doctrine. You are right
that some think tank experts have disputed this, but, as we have seen
over the past few weeks, the U.S. government has pretty good insight
into Russian defense planning. I trust the U.S. government over outside
experts on this point.]{.underline}

Third, [the academic debate about whether there is a formal Russian
doctrine or not misses the point entirely. The real question is, would
Russia find it attractive to threaten to use (and in certain
circumstances actually use) nuclear weapons in order to win a conflict
with the West? And, as we are seeing this week, the answer is
unequivocally yes.]{.underline}

MK: As you know, [military threats are most effective when one doesn't
have to carry them out. Russia is starting with threats in the hope that
will work, but it retains the option of following through with actual
nuclear strikes if it comes to that.]{.underline} We saw Russia run a
similar playbook in 2014. As Putin invaded Crimea and eastern Ukraine's
Donbass region, he said, "Russia is one of the leading nuclear powers.
... It's best not to mess with us." Russian officials relayed similar
threats to Western leaders. And while Russia did not put its nuclear
forces on high alert, Putin later bragged that he almost did. [So,
essentially, Russia is backstopping its conventional aggression with
nuclear threats]{.underline}. [Step 1: Invade your neighbors. Step 2:
Threaten nuclear war to prevent outside interference that could reverse
your conquest.]{.underline}

EA: That's a better characterization. As the Georgetown University
professor [Caitlin Talmadge pointed out last week, the Russians are
largely using their nuclear weapons as an umbrella, presuming that the
stability-instability paradox---which suggests that states with nuclear
weapons are even more likely to start a war, assuming that nuclear
weapons will prevent the worst outcomes---will hold that and they'll be
able to get away with conventional military activity as a
result.]{.underline} But for the United States, the result is the same
whether or not Russia says it out loud[. The United States doesn't have
an interest in getting in a shooting war with Russia, particularly given
the risks of nuclear escalation that come with it]{.underline}. There's
a reason why, during the Cold War, the superpowers typically kept
conflict contained to proxies.

MK: So you don't think there is any risk that Russia will use nuclear
weapons? I don't want to overstate this. It is very unlikely at this
point, but depending on how this conflict develops[, I see a real
threat]{.underline}. [In fact, I think Putin would use nuclear weapons
in Ukraine, for example, as a last resort in a desperate effort to stave
off an embarrassing military defeat. And while you are right that the
United States has an incentive to avoid nuclear war, so does Putin. The
United States is a nuclear superpower, and a nuclear exchange would also
result in unacceptable costs for Russia. If the West simply cowers in
response to his nuclear threats, we are essentially telling him,
"Threaten nuclear war and you can invade whomever you
want."]{.underline}

EA: [I do think there is a risk of nuclear escalation here, which is why
I'm so concerned about increasing the United States' and NATO's exposure
to this conflict]{.underline}. The United States and Europe have already
placed unprecedented and punishing sanctions on the Russian economy.
They're continuing to arm and supply the Ukrainians and taking a number
of diplomatic steps. But Ukraine isn't a NATO member. It isn't under
America's nuclear umbrella. [The United States should not get into a war
for Ukrain]{.underline}e. And too many of the options on the table at
this point---such as a no-fly zone---risk pulling the United States
directly into this conflict in ways that could eventually go nuclear.

### AT Putin posturing -- won't use 

#### Russian military actions demonstrate willingness to break norms -- and poor performance risks use of tactical nuke out of frustration 

**Tannenwald,** a senior lecturer in political science at Brown
University , **2022**

\[Nina, "Is Using Nuclear Weapons Still Taboo? The world is starting to
forget the realities of nuclear weapons" Foreign Policy JULY 1,

accessed july 4 GDI-TM\]

Which brings us back to Putin. In 1999, Putin launched himself to power
as Russia's prime minister, overseeing the country's shockingly brutal
second war in Chechnya. Since then, Russia under Putin has shown itself
willing to violate important international norms, including those
against territorial conquest (Crimea, Ukraine) and against attacking
civilian targets. Shredding the rules of war, the Russian military has
inflicted devastation and cruelty on civilians in Chechnya, Syria, and
now Ukraine. In Ukraine, Russia shelled Europe's largest nuclear power
plant at Zaporizhzhia, a reckless act that set part of the facility on
fire. Such strikes risk nuclear disaster.

Russian officials have portrayed Ukraine's national identity and
existence as a threat to Russia and have employed increasingly
exterminationist language in their stated quest to "denazify" Ukraine as
well as to justify the war to the Russian public. [Coming on top of what
appear to be appalling Russian war crimes]{.underline} in the Ukrainian
cities of Bucha, Kherson, Mariupol, and elsewhere, [such talk raises the
specter of genocide]{.underline}. [Leaders who are willing to engage in
genocide might not feel many inhibitions about using a nuclear
weapon.]{.underline}

We do not know what is in Putin's head, of course. [But the worry is
that if the war continues going badly for Russia, Putin might reach for
a tactical nuclear weapon]{.underline}---a low-yield bomb designed for
use on the battlefield---[out of frustration. While smaller than the big
city-razing strategic ones, they are still tremendously destructive
thermonuclear weapons]{.underline} with all the devastating effects of
the Hiroshima bomb.

The United States and Ukraine do not have identical interests in this
war. [While Russia's aggression, protected by nuclear threats, must not
pay, the United States has an obligation to avoid a wider war that could
increase the risk of direct U.S.-Russian confrontation. Of all the
lessons of the past, the risk of nuclear war is one we forget only at
our deepest peril.]{.underline}

Transitioning from temporary to permanent deployment

[NATO has also mobilized its high-readiness Reaction Force for the first
time and aims to establish four new multinational battalions in the
Black Sea region]{.underline} -- with France offering to lead the one in
Romania, Italy in Bulgaria, and the Czech Republic in Slovakia[. Most of
these deployments are on a temporary basis, but the receiving allies
would understandably like them to stay longer and for NATO to commit to
permanent stationed forces.]{.underline}

[Although this would oblige the alliance to break formally from the
pledge it made to Moscow in 1997 not to station substantial combat
forces or nuclear weapons or build military infrastructure on the
territory of its new member states in eastern Europe, this was a
political undertaking linked to circumstances prevailing at the
time.]{.underline}

[Given Russia's behaviour, there is no reason why NATO should not now
abandon it]{.underline}. There is also a question over whether NATO
could also repeal the NATO-Russia Founding Act and the NATO-Russia
Council, or simply leave them in suspension for a future, more
cooperative, and less bellicose Russian regime.

Beyond showing the flag along its eastern flank[, NATO does face
longer-term issues]{.underline} which need to be clarified in its new
Strategic Concept. First is [whether to abandon its current strategy of
reinforcement and military mobility across Europ]{.underline}e -- known
as [the Enhanced Forward Presence]{.underline} in the NATO jargon -- [in
favour of the deployment of heavy armoured brigades or even divisions in
fixed positions close to borders.]{.underline} [This will be expensive
in the long-run and deprive allies of the flexibility]{.underline} they
have enjoyed since the end of the Cold War to use their forces as and
where they wish -- from deployments in the Sahel or Afghanistan to
fighting forest fires or building emergency hospitals for COVID-19
patients at home. The only exception is when they have put forces on
rotation into the NATO high readiness forces or the European Union (EU)
Battle Groups. Germany's commitment gives NATO more options [The
decision of Germany to increase its defence spending to two per cent of
GDP and to devote €100 billion to modernizing the Bundeswehr makes it
technically possible for NATO to move to a Cold War-style forward,
armoured defence. But it is unclear how quickly Berlin could raise its
new divisions given its problems with procurement and
government/industry relations in the defence sector]{.underline}. It may
make more sense for Germany not to launch new acquisition programmes but
to buy existing off-the-shelf capabilities -- as it has recently done
with its decision to buy 35 US F35 aircraft -- which other European
countries are also acquiring, offering economies of scale and cheaper
operating and maintenance costs. [But if Germany abandons ambitious
defence projects with France]{.underline} -- which prefers a 'buy
European' approach -- such as the Future European Air Combat System,
[the relationship with France will become strained and French plans for
EU self-reliance in the military field]{.underline} put at risk. As a
country averse to war fighting and narrow military approaches to
security, [it is uncertain how much of the conventional defence burden
in NATO Germany would be willing to take on, so this could be the
opportunity to create more integrated European units with France, the
Benelux, Poland, and Italy, even with the post-Brexit UK.]{.underline}
The UK has doubled the size of its forces in Estonia and sent 1,000
troops to Poland, as well as devoting a substantial portion of its army,
navy, and airforce to regular NATO exercises in the Baltic region.
London was also the first ally to grant Sweden and Finland a temporary
security guarantee pending full integration into the alliance. NATO will
likely settle on a compromise, increasing the size of its battalions on
its eastern flank -- turning them into battle groups -- but giving each
one a larger reserve force which will remain in Germany or other
European allied countries.

The invasion of Ukraine has sparked a substantial expansion in NATO
presence in the Baltics. Over the course of the last several weeks and
months, the United States has deployed an additional 15,000 troops and
advanced U.S. defense equipment to Europe, including F-35 fighters and
an infantry battalion taskforce to the Baltics. Other NATO allies are
also expanding their presence to add to rotational deployments in the
Baltics, including the UK, Germany, Norway, and Denmark. NATO has also,
for the first time, activated its Response Force, a contingent of more
than 40,000 allied special operations and maritime troops now on high
alert.

[Nevertheless, the NATO presence in the Baltics is often seen less as a
practical defense measure but rather as a "tripwire" for any potential
Russian assault, making it clear that such military action against
NATO's eastern flank would be against many members of the alliance,
including the United States]{.underline}. Still, the [future of Eastern
Europe remains deeply unsettled, with renewed focus on potential fault
lines between Russia and its Baltic neighbors]{.underline}. And while
the Biden Administration has made it clear that U.S. troops will not be
engaged in Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are NATO allies and
host to hundreds of U.S. troops. **[Any spillover of the crisis there

Today, that old dread of disaster has all but disappeared, as have the
systems that helped preclude it. But [[the]{.mark} actual [threat of
nuclear catastrophe is much greater than we
realize.]{.mark}]{.underline} Diplomacy and a desire for global peace
have given way to complacency and a false sense of security that nuclear
escalation is outside the realm of possibility. [That leaves us
unprepared for---and highly vulnerable to---a nuclear attack from
Russia.]{.underline} The most recent sign of American complacency was
the death, a few weeks ago, of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty---a pivotal 1987 agreement that introduced intrusive on-site
inspection provisions, destroyed an entire class of dangerous weaponry,
and convinced both Washington and Moscow that the other wanted strategic
stability more than strategic advantage. The New START treaty, put in
place during the Obama administration, appears headed for a similar fate
in 2021. In fact, [nearly [all the key U.S.-Russian arms control and
confidence-building provisions of the Cold War era are dead or on life
support]{.mark}]{.underline}, with little effort underway to update or
replace them. Meanwhile, [U.S. officials from both parties are focused
not on how we might avoid nuclear catastrophe but on showing how tough
they can look]{.underline} against a revanchist Russia and its leader,
Vladimir Putin. Summit meetings between White House and Kremlin leaders,
once viewed as opportunities for peace, are now seen as dangerous
temptations to indulge in Munich-style appeasement, the cardinal sin of
statecraft. [American policymakers worry more about "going
wobbly,"]{.underline} as Margaret Thatcher once put it, [than about a
march of folly into inadvertent war.]{.underline} President Donald
Trump's suggestion that the United States and Russia might explore ways
to manage their differences diplomatically has produced mostly
head-scratching and condemnation. In my more than 25 years of government
experience working on Russia matters, I've seen that three misguided
assumptions underlie how the United States got to this point. The first
is that [American [policymakers think that because neither side wants
nuclear war, then]{.mark} such a [war is]{.mark} very [unlikely]{.mark}
to occur.]{.underline} Russia would be foolish, we reason, to cross
swords with the powerful U.S. military and risk its own
self-destruction, and many [[Americans find it hard to imagine
that]{.mark} modern [cyber duels]{.mark}, proxy battles, information
operations and economic warfare [might]{.mark} somehow [erupt into
direct nuclear attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline} If the Cold War ended
peacefully, the thinking goes, why should America worry that a new
shadow war with a much less formidable Russia will end any differently?
[But wars do not always begin by design. Just as they did in 1914, [a
vicious circle of clashing]{.mark} geopolitical [ambitions, distorted
perceptions]{.mark} of each other's intent, new and poorly understood
technologies, [and disappearing rules]{.mark} of the game [could combine
to produce a disaster]{.mark} that neither side wants nor
expects.]{.underline} In fact, **[[cyber
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, artificial intelligence, advanced
hypersonic weapons delivery systems and antisatellite weaponry [**[are
making the U.S.-Russian shadow war]{.mark} much [more]{.mark} complex
and [dangerous than the]{.mark} old [Cold War]{.mark} competition. [They
are blurring]{.mark} traditional [lines between espionage and warfare,
entangling nuclear and conventional weaponry, and erasing old
distinctions between offensive and defensive operations.]{.mark}**
Whereas the development of nuclear weaponry]{.underline} in the Cold War
[produced the concept of mutually assured destruction and had a
restraining effect, in the cyber arena, playing offense is increasingly
seen as the best defense. And in a highly connected world in which
financial networks, commercial operations, media platforms, and nuclear

not hard to imagine a crisis scenario]{.mark} in which [Russia cyber
operators gain access to a satellite system that controls]{.mark} both
[U.S.]{.mark} conventional and [nuclear weapons
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, leaving the American side uncertain about

preparations or to disable our ability to conduct nuclear strikes.

appeals to appease Moscow or accept some kind of negotiated settlement
that would avoid "humiliating" Russia. There can be no compromise with
the Kremlin as long as Putin continues to deny Ukraine's right to exist
and declares his intention to annex entire regions of the country. [If
Putin is not decisively defeated in Ukraine, he will surely go further
in his mission to "return" lost Russian lands.]{.underline} [The list of
former Russian imperial possessions that could potentially become
targets is extensive and includes Finland, the Baltic States, Poland,
Belarus, Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the nations of
Central Asia]{.underline}. Nor can future Russian attacks on the former
Warsaw Pact countries of Central Europe be entirely ruled out. [If this
sounds far-fetched, it is important to remember that almost nobody in
Ukraine believed a Russian invasion was even remotely possible until it
actually happened. Today's brutal colonial war in Ukraine]{.underline}
is a [reminder]{.underline} that unlike the other great European empires
of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries[, Russia never underwent a
period of de-imperialization]{.underline}. Despite collapsing
spectacularly in both 1917 and 1991, Russia's imperial identity is still
very much intact and has become a central pillar of the Putin regime.
[Until Russia enters the modern era and becomes a post-imperial power,
peace in Europe will remain elusive]{.underline}. The best way to speed
up this process is to ensure Ukraine wins the war.

Russia represents a significant cyber threat to NATO and this has
already been demonstrated  by integrating cyber in the operations
carried out during the Georgia and Ukraine/Crimea conflicts.  [Cyber is
a low cost and deniable tool, especially when "non-state" proxies are
used. The use of  Moscow proxies]{.underline} to [disrupt and
destabilize the civilian population and critical infrastructure
particularly  in its near abroad, but also in NATO/EU space bordering
Russian territory, is a distinct possibility]{.underline}.  

Generally[, a proxy is in the service of a state-actor when the
respective state lacks the  required skills, knowledge and means to
operate in cyberspace. Another important reason for state  actors to use
proxies could be associated to political unwillingness to openly employ
state resources]{.underline},  especially in those cyber operations that
contradict legal, ethical, cultural or assumed norms. [A state operating
through proxies could demonstrate plausible deniability]{.underline},
whilst not exposing state-owned  technical capability. 

[Often Moscow has an important influence on elections, public opinion
and even politicians  using information warfare and cyber-attacks.
Russian also interfered with NATO exercises and other  Baseline
Activities and Current Operations (BACO) using cyber
operations]{.underline}, but also Electronic  Warfare (EW) interference
(including GPS jamming) to disrupt Alliance's events. [To estimate the

At the June 2021 NATO summit in Brussels, leaders agreed to develop an
updated Strategic Concept for approval in 2022 based on a new consensus.
If the Strategic Concept is to be more than a rhetorical exercise, it
must substantively address the difficulties that beset the Alliance and
the challenges facing it. The [mortal threat posed by a vengeful
Russia]{.underline} should form the core of the next version.

The [good news is that NATO holds most of the cards]{.underline}. Its
[combined GDP is]{.underline} some 20 times [greater than
Russia's]{.underline}, [and its overall defence spending]{.underline}
about 14 times [greater]{.underline}. [NATO's]{.underline} 30 [allies
and close]{.underline}, [official partners]{.underline} such as
Australia, Finland, Japan, South Korea and Sweden [constitute most of
the economic and military power on the planet]{.underline}, [and their
combined populations dwarf Russia's]{.underline}. In key capabilities
such as theatre logistics; strategic airlift; intelligence, surveillance
and reconnaissance; and sealift, [NATO swamps Russia's modest
holdings]{.underline}, [while the list of Russia's allies is both short
and unimpressive]{.underline}.

Nevertheless, [NATO must have the will to compete, and the US must lead
and encourag]{.underline}e, as it has since the Ukraine crisis began.
The Ukraine crisis has illuminated one founding premise of the Alliance
that had been obscured: that [America's support for NATO is not based on
altruism]{.underline}.

### AT: Ukraine sanctions reduce Russia threat

#### Russia still a threat despite setbacks -- resources and nuclear arsenal

(Jr R.D., \"The State of NATO: An American View,\" Survival, Vol. 64,

For seven decades, the [N]{.underline}orth [A]{.underline}tlantic
[T]{.underline}reaty [O]{.underline}rganization [has been the backbone
of American and European security]{.underline}, in tandem with nuclear
deterrence, [as a guarantor of peace in Europe and a major force for
global stability]{.underline}. The [unifying and most obvious threat is
Russia]{.underline}, a quasi-imperial power intent on reasserting
control and influence over its 'near abroad' and regaining its place as
a great power on the world stage. With its attempted conquest of
Ukraine, [Russia has yet again used military aggression to reassert
dominance in the territories of the former Russian empire]{.underline}.
This follows a decade of Russian belligerence in Chechnya, Georgia,
Donbas and Syria.

Russia's probable resilience

Russia's substandard military performance and Ukraine's steadfast
resistance have cast doubt on Vladimir Putin's goal of outright
conquest. [Russia]{.underline}, of course, [has survived several major
setbacks in the last century]{.underline} -- Finland in 1940, western
Russia in 1941, Grozny in 1995 -- [only to recover and
prevail]{.underline}. Absent direct NATO intervention, a negotiated
settlement guaranteeing Ukrainian neutrality that leaves Putin in
possession of Luhansk, Donetsk, Crimea and the land bridge connecting
them through Mariupol remains a possibility, along with eventual
sanctions relief. Such an outcome, even at high cost, would enable Putin
to claim success. After rebuilding his economy and military, [more
aggression in pursuit of Putin's grand vision and ambitions is possible
and perhaps likely]{.underline}.

The Baltic states represent exactly the kind of emerging, prosperous
Western democracies on former Soviet territory that Putin is known to
detest and fear. They each possess ethnic-Russian minorities, especially
Estonia and Latvia. They stand between Mother Russia and Kaliningrad,
home of Russia's Baltic Fleet, but isolated and separated by 300
kilometres from the Russian border. Wrenching the Baltic states from
NATO control would restore the strategic depth Russia lost in the 1990s
and end future NATO expansion for Ukraine and Georgia. These are
tempting rewards, and Moscow might imagine grasping them after a period
of truce in Ukraine and recovery at home, or in a spasm of desperation
if things turn more dire.1

The Baltic region is not the only European area of interest to Russian
planners. Russia's seizure and annexation of Crimea in 2014--15
effectively turned the Black Sea into a Russian lake.2 With 28,000
troops in Crimea, supported by the S-400 air-defence system and
anti-ship cruise-missile batteries, Russia is well postured to dominate
the Black Sea region.

The [West often prefers to describe Russia as]{.underline} '[in
decline]{.underline}', fostering the view that the threat will soon
dissipate.3 [This is a mistake]{.underline}. Despite its failures in
Ukraine, [Russia is still a formidable adversary]{.underline},
[possessed of enormous territory, vast natural resources, a strong and
intact culture, and an educated and patriotic population enamoured with
its historical status as a great power]{.underline}. [Russia still has
the world's strongest nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. To be sure, while
its economy ranked sixth in the world in terms of purchasing power
parity before Ukraine, [devastating sanctions are likely to hobble
Russia for some time]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [it is unlikely to fade
into irrelevance]{.underline}.4

## Space capabilities

### SQ = Inaction on Space Security

#### Not enough attention to cyber vulnerabilities in the status quo

**Unal 19** \[Beyza, senior research fellow with the International
Security Department at Chatham House, worked in the Strategic Analysis
Branch at NATO Allied Command and Transformation, "Cybersecurity of
NATO's Space-based Strategic Assets," Chatham House Research Paper,

accessed 07/04/22, GDI-JCR\]

Strategic military systems depend heavily on space-based assets for
navigation and targeting, timing, positioning, command and control,
operational monitoring, intelligence gathering and reconnaissance, among
other functions. However, [the increasing vulnerability of space-based
assets]{.underline}, ground stations, associated command and control
systems, and the personnel who manage the systems, [has not yet received
the attention it deserves.]{.underline} This is particularly true in
regard to the so-called 'New Space' revolution: the growing role of the
private sector in space. For example, during the Iraq war of 2003--11,
there was a 560 per cent increase in the US reliance on commercial
satellites for military purposes.9 Policy influencers and [policymakers
are struggling to grasp the full impact of cyber vulnerabilities in the
context of both space-based assets and strategic systems.]{.underline}
Just as with physical attacks on space-based assets -- such as
anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) strikes10 -- [cyberattacks have the
potential to wreak havoc on strategic weapons systems and undermine
deterrence by creating uncertainty and confusion.]{.underline}
Cyberthreats pose a significant and complex challenge due to the absence
of a warning and speed of an attack, the difficulty of attribution, and
the complexities associated with carrying out a proportionate response.
Given the progress made in the areas of strategic conventional weapon
systems -- for example, the development of advanced cruise missiles and
hypersonic glide vehicles -- [it is essential for NATO and its allies to
be able to rely upon space-based systems for early observation and
detection]{.underline}; this may enable them to identify and attribute
activities and to launch effective, calibrated responses. [Cyber
technology and innovation are accessible across much of the world,
levelling the field and creating opportunities for states outside the
NATO alliance -- such as China, Russia and North Korea]{.underline}, for
example -- [to instigate high-impact attacks on allied-owned strategic
assets]{.underline}

#### \*NATO needs a more proactive policy toward cyber security of space assets -- Russia and China are deploying offensive tech

Security Department at Chatham House, worked in the Strategic Analysis

[Cyber research is a fast-moving and constantly evolving area of
science, and the scope of cyberthreats that countries face is on the
rise as malicious actors find new ways to infiltrate weapons
systems.]{.underline} The use of electronic warfare methods and
cyberattacks in peacetime illustrates the blurred lines of engagement
between nations even in the absence of conflict. According to Norwegian
military and NATO officials, Russia persistently jammed civilian GPS
signals during NATO's 2018 Trident Juncture exercise in Europe's High
North region, which highlights the growing threat. In November 2018,
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg stated that electronic warfare
and cyberattacks were increasingly being used in operations.14 It was
also reported that NATO officials believed Russia is testing this
capability through its large-scale exercises, such as Zapad 2017, which
was conducted jointly with Belarus in September 2017.15 According to the
Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS), the most common
cyberthreats to the space segment, ground segment and space-link
communication segment include data corruption/modification; ground
system loss; interception of data; jamming; denial of service;
masquerade (spoofing); replay; software threats; and unauthorized
access.16 There is also crossover between offensive and defensive
activities in cyberspace and space, given that -- technologically --
offence is easier and more cost-effective than defence.17 Furthermore,
space-related personnel are vulnerable to cyberthreats. Social
engineering is becoming an important tool when used by adversaries, and
-- whether it occurs deliberately or unwittingly -- the potential for
people to constitute the weakest link in cyber defence is an increasing
reality.18 [The nature of cyber activities must evolve from being purely
defensive to include active, persistent engagement, in order to disrupt
attackers of western critical space-based capabilities.]{.underline}
Given the importance of space-based systems to critical infrastructure
that supports NATO military capabilities, it would be prudent to assume
that an adversary is already active in these networks and focus on
resilience measures. [This increases urgency for advanced techniques,
such as AI and machine learning (ML),19 to identify and respond to
modern threats.]{.underline} [Both China and Russia prioritize
electronic warfare, cyberattacks and superiority within the
electromagnetic battlespace as part of a strategy to achieve victory in
future operations.]{.underline} Available doctrine from these nations
highlights a key focus on preventing adversarial satellite-based
communication systems from impacting their operational effectiveness20
-- a focus shared in US military planning and policy.21 [Russian space
capabilities and their cybertechnologies pose particular threats to
NATO.]{.underline} For its navigational system, Russia relies on its own
satellite system GLONASS (Global Navigation Satellite System), rather
than the US-provided GPS or the EU's Galileo system. As part of a series
of improvements to its communications technology and GLONASS, Russia is
designing new navigation satellites, which are claimed to be highly
accurate and longer lasting.22 [Russia has been testing its capabilities
in a hybrid context in Syria and in Ukraine]{.underline}, particularly
relying on capabilities for jamming GPS signals to ground remotely
piloted aircraft. [It is reported to have conducted denial-of-service
attacks on radio and telephone equipment, and to have attempted to steal
encrypted military data.]{.underline}23

### Cyber Attacks Increasing

\*GPS = Global Positioning System

[Space-based infrastructure is a critical infrastructure for security
and the economy]{.underline} --- in fact, [it is critical
to]{.underline} [most aspects of]{.underline} [modern life]{.underline}
--- [and therefore]{.underline} is [a prime target for malicious
attacks]{.underline} (Falco 2019). The [most significant]{.underline}
current security threat to space-based infrastructure and applications
[is]{.underline} from [cyberattacks]{.underline}. [Only a handful of
countries have]{.underline} the [capabilities to physically]{.underline}
[destroy satellites]{.underline} (Weeden and Samson 2022) ---
[and]{.underline} they [are likely to be exposed as]{.underline} the
[perpetrators]{.underline}. In contrast, executing a cyberattack
requires much less in terms of funds and technological and engineering
capabilities. Moreover, the attacker can attempt to cover its tracks,
leaving the attacked country uncertain about attribution and its own
response. Therefore, [cyberattacks are likely to become the leading
method of targeting space-based infrastructure for state actors, as well
as non-state]{.underline} [actors]{.underline}, notably criminal
organizations and terrorist groups. [There is evidence that such attacks
have already occurred]{.underline}: [Russia]{.underline} allegedly
[disrupted]{.underline} Global Positioning System ([GPS]{.underline})
[signals]{.underline} [during]{.underline} North Atlantic Treaty
Organization [exercises in Finland]{.underline}, [Sweden]{.underline}
[and Norway in 2018]{.underline} (Harrison et al. 2020), affecting,
inter alia, the ability of commercial aircrafts to navigate;
[Turla]{.underline}, a Russian criminal gang, allegedly
[hijacked]{.underline} [satellite IP]{.underline} (Internet Protocol)
[addresses]{.underline} (Zetter 2015), which it later used to steal
data; [and]{.underline} [Hamas of Gaza]{.underline}, a terrorist
organization, [hacked]{.underline} the [satellite broadcast]{.underline}
of a major Israeli television channel (Leyden 2014). [A]{.underline}
cyberattack targeting space assets, or [space-cyberattack]{.underline},
[can jam GPS signals]{.underline}, [disabling navigation]{.underline},
[or spoof GPS signals]{.underline}, [providing misleading
locations]{.underline}, [in]{.underline} [both cases disrupting travel
and guided weapons systems]{.underline}. [A space-cyberattack
can]{.underline} "[blind]{.underline}" [remote sensing satellites that
provide satellite imagery and other data collected by various
sensors]{.underline}. [It can interrupt]{.underline} [communication
satellites services]{.underline}, including television, radio and
internet. Moreover, [it can disrupt banking and payment
systems]{.underline}, including the use of credit cards and automated
banking machines, which rely on satellite-based precise timing. Indeed,
[important segments of]{.underline} the [global financial system depend
on GPS]{.underline} (Fernholz 2017). Further, a [space-cyberattack
can]{.underline} [do more than render a satellite defunct]{.underline}:
[it can turn it into a weapon]{.underline}, for example, by taking
control of it and altering its course so that it crashes into another
satellite. Indeed, the [combined space-cyber warfare theatre will
be]{.underline} the [primary battlefield for global powers
in]{.underline} the [twenty-first century]{.underline} (Boucher 2013).
Accordingly, a report published by Harvard's Belfer Center for Science
and International Affairs suggested that the first mission of the new US
Space Force should be to ensure cybersecurity of space assets (Falco
2018). In a signal on the future of warfare, the head of the US
Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral John Aquilino, recently noted, "We've come
a long way in a short time to be able to integrate the space and cyber
domains" (quoted in Sevastopulo 2022).

### Cyber exercises/Military to military exercises key 

#### Cooperative training exercises needed to shore up NATO space cybersecurity

[Training is essential to create awareness and prepare the alliance for
worst case scenarios. NATO could promote different types of training
that would capture space security and system vulnerabilities to
cyberattacks.]{.underline} Training areas could be selected through a
lessons-learned analysis where former cases could be used to highlight
areas of greatest need. Some examples are as follows: • [At the
political-strategic level, crisis management exercises]{.underline}
(CMX), [hybrid warfare exercises and similar training could incorporate
cyber resilience and bring space elements into cybersecurity
training.]{.underline} • At the technical level, given the complexity of
space systems, [focused training, modelling and simulation would be key
to ensuring design integrity]{.underline}. • [Bringing the technical and
political communities together in training modules would be
helpful.]{.underline} Often the political community and technical
community do not metaphorically speak the same language and their
concerns do not merge. [Such training would be technology-driven and
could incorporate modelling and simulation. Thus, technical expertise
and knowledge could be transferred into political action
plans.]{.underline} • Training may also involve the private sector or
contractors. NATO decides whether or not it should delegate parts of the
training to the private sector or to conduct it internally. There are
advantages and disadvantages in both. One of the advantages in
delegating the work to an outside party is that the latter could conduct
an analysis without any NATO restrictions and could significantly test
NATO's planning and operations. The main disadvantage is that NATO may
not be able to share classified information, which would make the
training less comprehensive. • [Some of the most useful training methods
involve exercises, 'war gaming', crisis simulations and scenario
planning, as well as online training education programmes, training
manuals, and certifications. NATO should also measure the impact of the
training and assess its skill-maintenance capacity.]{.underline}

[NATO has to review and renew its strategies for building defences by
policy development and raising awareness against new and evolving
threats, to protect space-based technologies]{.underline} that
supplement lost capabilities and negate adversarial interference with
space systems. [NATO relies on its Allied capabilities; therefore, it is
essential to have a unique coordinate system to respond during a
crisis.]{.underline} The already existing [exercises, such as the Crisis
Management Exercise (CMX)]{.underline} which focus on cyber, and
resilience [should be implemented with space assets. This internal and
partner consultation and decision-making procedures at the strategic
politicalmilitary level would help to strengthen the alliance response
and resilience.]{.underline} Therefore, [NATO has to operate with a
renewed focus]{.underline} on improving proficiency in Allied Cyberspace
and Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations, [by building awareness,
developing policies and strategies, acquiring new capabilities, working
with industry and academia, and training people to become experts.
Building defence is possible by "raising awareness" throughout the NATO
systems, and by creation of regulation through NATO security framework ,
in a standardized and collective way which require a proactive effort to
prevent, detect and prepare forces to respond to incidents, by
developing guidelines, resources, and working groups focusing on
emerging technologies to protect the space assets, and test coherency of
the rules and their application by raising preparedness, building blocks
between law and policy requirements for collective defence.]{.underline}
The traditional policy creation mechanisms are based on multilateralism.
States and most of the traditional international organizations struggle
to adapt themselves to evolving realities of the new technologies and
their applications and implications in new domains, such as cyber and
space. Another aspect is to keep the will and interests of member states
alive for policy development. [This requires NATO to revise and
update/adapt its mechanisms, in a way to support a clear-eyed, inclusive
policy development, to overcome siloed or single domain-based
approaches, to manoeuvre and react in the extremely complex
environments]{.underline}. As a military-security organization, and as
to its foundational concerns, unlike UN, NATO cannot represent an open
forum for the intellectual construction, however, can support and
benefit from the effective participation of the commercial actors, which
own operate and manage these new domains, and can assess and adapt these
new policies created to remain at the speed of relevance, as highlighted
in JAPCC 2021 meeting this year

### Internal link - NATO Cyber Coop Key

#### Cyber vulnerability of NATO space assets risks crushing NATO's military capabilities and deterrence -- only fostering cooperation on cyber security can solve.

**Lumiste 19** \[Liina, International Law Researcher for the NATO
Comparative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, "Chatham House report:
Space -- NATO cyber security's weak spot,"
<https://ccdcoe.org/library/publications/chatham-house-report-space-nato-cyber-securitys-weak-spot/>,
accessed 07/04/22, GDI-JCR\]

In 2018, Norwegian military and allied officials confirmed that Russia
had disrupted NATO's Trident Juncture exercise in Europe's High North
region by persistently jamming GPS signals during the exercise. China
has claimed 'the ability to use space-based systems and to deny them to
adversaries as central to modern warfare'. As [the dependence of
military operations on space-based assets has increased exponentially
over the last few decades and space-based assets are potential targets
for cyber attack]{.underline}, the newly released Chatham House research
paper 'Cybersecurity of NATO's Space-based Strategic Assets' suggests
that [NATO should bring space more to the spotlight]{.underline}. The
research paper lists cyber threats to space-based strategic assets and
capabilities, analyses capability requirements and gives concrete
recommendations for ways improve the resilience of the space-based
systems. Space-based assets as targets for cyber attacks [Strategic
military systems depend on space-based assets for the provision of data
and for many capabilities, such as positioning, navigation and timing
(PNT), intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), missile
defence, communications, space situational awareness (SSA) as well as
environmental monitoring]{.underline}. For accurate timing and
navigation in PNT systems, NATO uses the global positioning system (GPS)
which is also well known and widespread in civil use. ISR information
and imagery is collected through surveillance and reconnaissance
sensors. Both systems are satellite-based. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
systems also rely on satellite-based 'beyond-line-of-sight'
communication. These are only a few of the possible examples. In
addition to the abundance of capabilities, it is noteworthy that [the
capabilities are also linked and therefore affecting one capability may
cause collateral effects on others.]{.underline} As explained in the
Space Threat Assessment 2018 published by the Centre for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS), there are several intrusion points for
space-based assets: antennas on satellites and ground stations,
landlines that connect ground stations to terrestrial networks, and user
terminals that connect to satellites. This can result in data or data
traffic monitoring, inserting false or corrupted data in the system, or
even the permanent loss of a satellite. As with every other technology,
people have the potential to be the weakest link in the cyber defence of
space-based assets -- social engineering is an important tool for the
adversary. Vulnerabilities The research paper highlights some of the
most important vulnerabilities: use of commercial companies;
'back-doors'; dual use of satellites; and supply chain security of space
technology. Chatham House reports have touched on these topics before.
The question of supply chain was raised in the Livingstone and Lewis
2016 report, which observed that there was no coherent global
organisation with regard to cyber security in space and that existing
approaches had only limited reach into the supply chain. In this year's
research paper, it is again stressed that when the supply chain does not
ensure that military security standards are met, items procured may
expose NATO systems to vulnerabilities. [NATO by itself does not own
satellites, but is dependent on member states.]{.underline} In case of
need, NATO requests access to products and services from the allies.
[NATO allies procure equipment and software, which will be integrated
into their national defence infrastructure.]{.underline} In most cases,
military and commercial assets are not separate. Therefore,
[NATO]{.underline} does not rely only on military assets, but [also uses
commercial, civilian and national or multinational assets for
operations.]{.underline} Even though commercial methods have proven to
be effective, they are accompanied by the inherent risk of lower
security requirements. Data exchange between civil and military sectors
may cause extra vulnerabilities. As most of the space-based capabilities
are dual-use, meaning that assets are used both for military and
civilian purposes, the Chatham House research paper recommends that
operators 'apply higher-grade military hardening and cyber protection
specifications to civilian capabilities that have the potential to be
used in support of military applications'. The research paper also
highlights the aspect of NATO's dependency on member states for
communication capacity as a possible source of vulnerabilities.
[NATO]{.underline} owns satellite communications (SATCOM) ground
stations, but no satellites; it [is therefore highly reliant on allies
to provide space-sourced data, information and services.]{.underline} In
addition, [ensuring the security of space capabilities is mostly in the
hands of the allies. **This puts NATO into a position where its main
option to protect capabilities of vital importance is to encourage
allies to put effort into securing the space-based assets and foster
cooperation in space-based systems cyber security.**]{.underline} Space
as a domain of operations? During the Brussels Summit in 2018, the
Alliance recognised space as a 'highly dynamic and rapidly evolving
area, which is essential to a coherent Alliance deterrence and defence
posture' and on 27 June 2019, it approved new space policy. As claimed
by NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, the space policy gives
guidance on opportunities and challenges and is not about militarising
space, but about information sharing and increasing interoperability.
The research paper suggests that, in addition to policy, NATO needs to
agree upon space doctrine. While policy directs, assigns tasks and
prescribes desired capabilities, doctrine provides principles of how
operations should be planned, prepared, commanded, conducted, sustained,
terminated and assessed.1 This suggestion becomes even more relevant
when taking into consideration recent announcements by some NATO
diplomats about NATO's aims to recognise space as a domain of warfare
during the London summit at the end of 2019. This indeed would be a big
step towards focusing more on space-based assets and their
vulnerabilities. [Considering the current context, in which China and
Russia are increasing their]{.underline} presence in space, this action
by NATO is inevitable. Whether or not NATO claims space as a domain,
adversaries will nevertheless develop their [aggressive
capabilities]{.underline}, from cyber operations to anti-satellite
missiles. Therefore, [it is prudent to update the approach towards space
and space-based assets to face new challenges.]{.underline} Yet,
claiming space to be a domain of warfare highlights legal
considerations. The Chatham House research paper raises a question from
the cyber perspective: whether a cyber attack on a space system has to
have kinetic consequences in order to give grounds for collective
self-defence according to the Washington Treaty. This can be
supplemented with a question on whether causing kinetic consequences
that result in debris breaches the responsibility not to cause
widespread, long-term and severe damage to the natural environment, as
stipulated in article 35 of Additional Protocol I to the Geneva
Conventions of 12 August 1949.2 Another question raised is targeting
dual-use space technology in international humanitarian law (IHL). The
principle of distinction foresees the duty to distinguish between the
civilian population and combatants and between civil and military
objects. As in the case of cyber objectives,3 dual-use satellites should
be counted as military objectives, but would be subject to the rule of
proportionality and requirement to take precautions in attack.4
Conclusion The Chatham House research paper makes recommendations that
more or less all stress the same things: **[NATO is highly dependent on
space capabilities; space-based systems are vulnerable to cyber attacks
and will become more and more appetising targets for adversaries; and
NATO must foster cooperation and information sharing between member
states.]{.underline}** [Overlooking these aspects could undermine the
credibility of the information provided through the space-based systems,
**which would in turn affect deterrence and strategic
liability**.]{.underline} In the broader view, [destabilising
space-based assets would not only affect military conduct, but also have
severe effects on civil infrastructures.]{.underline}

[The first challenge for NATO in Outer Space is regulatory, while the
increasingly congested]{.underline}, contested, commercial, and
competitive [nature of Space operations intensifies the need for legal
clarity and harmonization, the development of national space law
frameworks are at a different pace. The lack of clarity weakens the
alliances options for deterrence]{.underline}, therefore, as Secretary
General Stoltenberg highlighted \[28\] build on previous cyberattack
declarations to issue a formal declaration stating the readiness to
counter attacks on Allied Space assets, including an explanation of
which assets fall within the scope of the Treaty \[29\]. As a result,
following the collective commitment under Article 3 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, to reduce vulnerabilities and ensure Allied militaries
can effectively operate in peace, crisis and conflict, to strengthen
interoperability and understand vulnerabilities, [While the
institutional development is rapid, member states' legal development at
different pace and adoption of different standards, can lead to the
progressive dismantling of regulatory standards or]{.underline}, as NATO
Officials used, [to a 'race to the bottom', which could compromise the
interoperability of the Space legal frameworks of the member states, and
reduce the collective value of space assets and negatively impacts
NATO's Space power projection]{.underline} \[29\]. To this end, one of
NATO\'s space policy priorities is to foster enhanced interoperability
by fostering [a common legal Space doctrine based on agreements on
fundamental mechanisms, international standards]{.underline}, or norms
of behaviour, in which Allies [can collaborate using operational assets
and national policies or frameworks.]{.underline} "NATO does not own
satellites, but owns and operates terrestrial elements, such as
satellite communications anchor stations and terminals. It requests
access to products and services of member states -- such as space
weather reports and satellite overflight reports provided via satellite

A [credible, trusted, and transparent Space attribution process -- the
ability to trace the origin of an action against Space architectures --
underpins]{.underline} a [successful NATO Space deterrence
strategy]{.underline}. [Inability to determine]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [origin]{.underline} or source of a hostile or
malicious action [undermines the expectation of a credible
response]{.underline}.7 [Space Domain Awareness]{.underline} (SDA) [is a
critical part of]{.underline} [attributing]{.underline}
[threatening]{.underline} [or malicious action against Space
architectures]{.underline}. SDA encompasses the effective
identification, characterization, and understanding of any factor
associated with the Space domain that could affect Space operations.8
The United States has already crafted more than 100 agreements to share
situational awareness to support safe satellite operations. [SDA
alone,]{.underline} however, [may not be enough to enable Space
attribution]{.underline}. [We must go deeper in our understanding of the
domain. We must develop]{.underline} the [means to determine the source
and pathway of an attack against Space architectures after such an
attack has]{.underline} [occurred]{.underline}.9 [We need scientific
methods to gather data and information]{.underline} from satellites,
ground systems, and associated networks [regarding actions that are
non-kinetic or kinetic]{.underline}, [and reversible or
non-reversible]{.underline}. [For hostile actions in Space, the
attribution process may lead to a military response. Yet for less
serious acts in Space, attribution may lead to prosecution through
civilian courts or diplomatic admonishment]{.underline}. For the Space
attribution process to be viable when needed, [NATO Nations must prepare
now to develop]{.underline} the [requisite SDA and scientific
capabilities]{.underline}, [rehearse related intelligence collection and
information sharing]{.underline}, [and integrate trusted commercial
partners]{.underline}. [By rehearsing the attribution
process]{.underline} -- such as during combined Space exercises and
wargames -- [it may be determined that additional SDA capabilities are
needed]{.underline}. [Working together and sharing intelligence and
information will lead to increased]{.underline} [transparency and build
trust and confidence in]{.underline} the [Alliance's Space attribution
process]{.underline}. This [trust and confidence established in
peacetime can result in additional countries joining]{.underline} the
[Alliance's effort during times of crisis]{.underline}.

[Prudent risk-taking is inseparable from]{.underline} the [concepts of
innovation and agility]{.underline}. [Military Space forces must be
skilled at managing]{.underline} [risk]{.underline}, always seeking
mission accomplishment at the speed of relevance while recognizing that
perfection is often the enemy of good-enough. [Protracted acquisition

Strategic space capabilities are generally composed of three elements: a
space segment, a ground segment, and a user segment -- also known as an
uplink, a downlink and a crosslink -- that transmit telemetry data.1
[Military commanders, staff and senior decision-making cadres within
NATO receive mission-significant data]{.underline} through products2 --
e.g. space imagery and weather maps -- and services3 -- e.g. satellite
communications and position, navigation and timing (PNT) data --
[provided by member states with space capabilities. Although emerging
technologies]{.underline} such as artificial intelligence (AI) and the
Internet of Things (IoT) [could be force multipliers for space
capabilities]{.underline},4 [increased prevalence of cyber means may
also challenge the integrity of data carried through these
technologies.]{.underline} Most countries either own satellites or have
a stake in space-based assets for meteorological purposes and
communications.5 The functioning of all satellites is dependent on cyber
technology, including software, hardware and other digital components.
[Any threats that could impact a satellite's controls, reliability, or
bandwidth availability would pose a direct challenge to national
critical assets.]{.underline}6 [If cyberthreats are not effectively
addressed, vulnerabilities in the strategic infrastructure could result
in severe consequences for international security. Cyber vulnerabilities
strike at the heart of the key technologies in strategic doctrines and
military planning.]{.underline} In the event of crisis escalation, such
as in Ukraine, the Middle East or in South Asia, the assumption is that
weapons systems will perform as planned. But this should not be taken
for granted. [It is mission-critical for NATO to manage, preserve and
protect space capabilities]{.underline}, inter alia, [by means of
agreements and policies. Understanding space vulnerabilities and
ensuring that mitigation measures and redundancies are in place, will
help to protect NATO's space capabilities.]{.underline} NATO's missions
and operations are conducted in four areas: air, land, cyber and sea.7
[Space-based architecture is fundamental to the provision of data and
services to all domains.]{.underline} Therefore, [any vulnerability in
space infrastructure will likely spread to other domains.]{.underline}8
[The critical interdependency between space and other domains increases
the threat of cyber risks, which disproportionately affect mission
assurance. Investing in mitigation measures and in the resilience of
space systems are key priorities in protecting all domains.]{.underline}

in crisis decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception.
This dependency on space-based technology has major implications for the
way NATO conducts warfare today, and how it will do so in the
future.]{.underline} For instance, [in order to conduct precision
strikes or earth observation through the use of]{.underline} unmanned
aerial vehicles ([UAVs]{.underline} -- such as military drones),
[systems rely on]{.underline} so-called 'beyond-line-of-sight' (BLOS)
[communication via satellites -- especially in times of crisis and

[Position, navigation and timing (PNT)]{.underline} PNT [is a vital part
of any NATO operation. It provides forces with the necessary means to
conduct timely and effective operations.]{.underline} Thus, [the loss of
PNT would leave forces vulnerable to attacks.]{.underline} NATO uses GPS
for accurate timing and navigation in its PNT system. [The accuracy of
this data depends on the satellite geometry and the receiver
system.]{.underline} In the tactical domain, alliance troops may not
always have -- or be able to rely on -- space capabilities in conducting
their missions. For instance, during a NATO exercise in Finland in 2018,
Finland's civilian air navigation services were disrupted through
electronic means, which was later attributed to Russia.38 Loss of
navigation capability was also reported in Norway at the same time.
While these incidents were not cyberattacks, they illustrate [the extent
of NATO forces' dependency on navigational signals, and the
vulnerability of navigation systems to interference]{.underline}. In
2002, the EU initiated a European alternative to GPS, named Galileo,39
which is one of four existing Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS). At the core of Galileo lies a European strategic determination
to create a stand-alone system that is independent from but compatible
with the US's GPS system, thus providing much-needed resilience for both
the US and Europe. At the very beginning of its development, the US
claimed that Galileo would be superfluous to the already existing GPS
capability and that it would rival the capabilities of the US by
creating a reduced European security reliance on that country. Later,
this policy was dropped as it became increasingly obvious that Galileo
provided a necessary back-up system for GPS -- a parallel route for
space resilience, and therefore for trans-Atlantic security. There is a
need for GPS/Galileo interoperability for NATO military capabilities
that are dependent on space-based systems to ensure their reliability
and integrity. Galileo has a civilian portion and a public regulated
service (PRS), which is an encrypted navigation service, restricted to
governments that use it mainly in military applications.40 PRS has
anti-jamming and anti-spoofing capabilities, and is reserved for certain
users within EU member states. The US needs to negotiate access to the
PRS signals. When and if GPS fails to operate, Galileo is designed to
provide civilian and military services for the US as well as for Europe.
There is no interoperability issue between Galileo and GPS, as these
points were discussed and solved in the framework of the EU--US
agreement of 2004. The US needs to negotiate access to PRS signals.
There is no agreement yet for Galileo to replace GPS in case of the
latter's failure.

### Internal link - NATO Space Key to Intelligence

[Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR)]{.underline}41 ISR
[provides information and imagery intelligence to allied forces about
specific targets. It is used in air, land and maritime domains in order
to supply accurate and timely information to the relevant commander to
support decision-making]{.underline}.42 [NATO's intelligence-led
operations rely fundamentally upon space-based ISR capabilities, and the
effectiveness of the alliance's operations is based upon the
availability of these systems. The imagery that ISR provides can be used
both in conventional and nuclear weaponry command and control, and in
targeting.]{.underline} ISR capability is composed of airborne imagery
platforms, space-based assets and ground sensors. [The
information]{.underline} is collected through surveillance and
reconnaissance sensors, which [may be vulnerable to
cyberattacks.]{.underline} Sensors could also be manipulated through
physical or cyber means: this could even occur at the design stage
within the manufacturing organization -- a weakness all NATO countries
should be aware of, especially if they rely on equipment sourced from
non-NATO parties for the components of intelligence-gathering
technologies. NATO is working to improve the interoperability of ISR
capabilities. To this end, in 2011, nine NATO countries voluntarily
joined the Multi-intelligence All-source Joint Intelligence Surveillance
and Reconnaissance Coalition (MAJIIC-2) initiative, with the aim of
increasing interoperability and information-sharing between each
nation's ISR capabilities.43 [ISR technologies contribute significantly
to national, regional and international security. Through surveillance
systems, such technologies can observe and map adversary command,
control and communication systems, thus providing invaluable strategic
insights.]{.underline} Yet -- as stated by a former battalion
intelligence officer -- collecting all the necessary information from
multiple sources in a timely manner is not an easy task.44 That
information may be received at different times from different outlets.
Technology is an important factor in facilitating this analysis, and AI
can overcome many existent analytical difficulties and analyse data in a
compressed time frame. [Any loss of ISR capability through cyberattacks
would have dire consequences for strategic planning and
policy.]{.underline}

### Internal link - - NATO Space Key to Missile Defense

#### Space assets key to NATO missile defense

[Missile defence relies heavily on early warning capabilities otherwise
known as integrated threat warning and threat assessment]{.underline}
(ITW/TA): US [space-based infrared sensors detect]{.underline} the hot
plumes of [ballistic missile launches and communicate the information to
the service component command.]{.underline} Theatre missile defence,
which includes the Patriot missile defence system -- a long-range
surface-to-air missile system used by the US and NATO allies -- and
standard missile defence systems, and which is part of the naval
component of the integrated Aegis weapon system, also serves as part of
overall missile defence capability.45 [The Aegis combat system operates
in the maritime domain, using radar to track and guide weapons to
destroy targets; its elements -- which include a space tracking and
surveillance system]{.underline}, the AN/SPY-1A radar, a command and
decision system and a display system -- [could all potentially be
exposed to cyberattacks.]{.underline} The US Department of Defense
conducted an auditing exercise in 2018 for the internal controls of its
ballistic missile defence systems (BMDS). The aim of the audit was to
ensure that systems and programmes were functioning as intended. The
[findings indicated that there were 'internal control weaknesses related
to protecting networks and systems that process, store, and transmit
BMDS technical information'.]{.underline}46 These weaknesses could be
exploited through insider threat and/or cyber means. Missile defence
systems may fail, or they may be activated due to false information sent
from communication systems (such as ground-based radars) to the command
unit. The Israeli anti-missile defence system Iron Dome, for example, is
claimed to have a 90 per cent accuracy rate when intercepting targets.
Yet there have been cases where a faulty response within the system has
activated the launch of interceptor missiles erroneously, such as
occurred in Gaza in March 2018, when it was triggered by machine gun
fire.47 Thus the battle management and weapons control system was proved
at that time to be unable to make proper threat assessments. Similar
outcomes could result if the threat assessment control system is
interfered with via cyber means; the consequences could be much higher,
including the loss of civilian life. In the Israeli case, it was
reported that Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, a supplier of technology
to the Iron Dome system, together with Israel Aerospace Industries and
the Elisra Group, both of which were also involved in the project, faced
persistent cyberattacks during the period of October 2011 to August
2012. This resulted in the loss of sensitive data that was believed to
include the specifications of the Arrow 3 missile, developed jointly by
the US and Israel.48 Vulnerability to cyberattacks within the supply
chain is not unique to NATO, and NATO and its allies should address this
type of risk. Supply chain integrity (in terms of both hardware and
software) is imperative for reliable military systems. [One of the core
elements of a missile defence system is that it relies on the reception
of near real-time information by a command centre to be able to identify
and project the trajectory of an incoming missile.]{.underline} Through
automated response it calculates the speed, velocity and location of the
target in order to be able to intercept the incoming missile in a short
time frame. [Any deliberate interference with the
information,]{.underline} for instance from the radar, [could mean that
the defence missiles fail to intercept an incoming threat, or could lead
to a faulty decision based on falsified or spoofed
information.]{.underline} Thus, for example, a defence missile could
fail to hit the correct target and strike well beyond the intended
target zone. In order to detect deliberate interference or cyber
intrusion, it is important to put preventive measures in place. One such
measure could be to conduct organized, simulated cyberattacks on a
system to assess its performance: this is known as penetration testing.
In the future, detection of anomalies could be possible through ML and
AI, especially in closed networks.49

### Internal link - NATO Space Key to Environmental Monitoring

#### Key to environmental monitoring

An area often neglected in discussions of space-dependent capabilities
is the environmental monitoring of Earth: this process provides weather
forecasting, geospatial and oceanographic information. Environmental
monitoring is equally important during peacetime and during conflict.
This capability supports mission planning, flight trajectories and
targeting. For instance, in the context of NATO operations,
environmental monitoring could supply information on flooding trends in
a specific region, which a commander could access, allowing the latter
to plan a mission accordingly. Weather information is also crucial to
air defence planning and to the deployment of security against the use
of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) agents.
Real-time weather data is vital for missile launches and accurate
targeting. NATO does not itself supply data or equipment for the
provision of weather-related information. Instead, information about
environmental conditions -- and their potential impact on SATCOM and
sensor accuracy -- is provided to NATO by the US, through the
meteorological and oceanographic (METOC) community.55

In issuing this threat, the Nuclear Posture Review illustrates that
**[nonnuclear attacks on nuclear forces]{.underline}** and C3I
capabilities **[could be highly escalatory, even to the point of
directly sparking a nuclear war.]{.underline}** [A key challenge in
managing these escalation risks]{.underline} is that attacks on an
opponent\'s nuclear forces or their C3I capabilities (whether they
belong to the United States or another state) [might not be
deliberate.]{.underline} Since the late 2000s, scholars have warned
about the possibility of escalation in a U.S.-China conflict resulting
from so-called crisis instability generated by actual or threatened U.S.
nonnuclear operations that were intended to suppress China\'s
conventional forces but inadvertently degraded its nuclear forces or
associated C3I assets located in the theater of operations, thus leading
Beijing to fear it was being disarmed.3 Similar, if more infrequent,
scholarly warnings have been voiced about a U.S.-Russia conflict.4 Such
escalation would be inadvertent because it was the result of military
operations or threats that were not intended to be escalatory.5 This
article\'s thesis is that [**the risks of inadvertent escalation are
even more serious than these warnings suggest and are likely to increase
significantly in the future.** Driving these risks is the possibility
that]{.underline} Chinese, Russian, or U.S. C3I [assets located
outside]{.underline}---potentially far outside---[theaters of operation
could be attacked over the course of a conventional conflict. **These
assets include satellites used for early warning, communication, and
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR);**]{.underline}
ground-based radars and transmitters; and communication aircraft.6 [Such
assets constitute key nodes in states\' nuclear]{.underline} C3I
[systems]{.underline}, but they are also ["entangled" with nonnuclear
weapons]{.underline} in two ways.7 First, they are typically dual use;
that is, they enable both nuclear and nonnuclear operations. Second,
they are increasingly vulnerable to nonnuclear attack---much more
vulnerable, in fact, than most nuclear-weapon delivery systems.
[Entanglement could lead to escalation because both sides in a
U.S.-Chinese or U.S.-Russian conflict could have strong incentives to
attack the adversary\'s dual-use]{.underline} C3I [capabilities to
undermine its nonnuclear operations.]{.underline}8 As a result, [over
the course of a conventional war, the nuclear]{.underline} C3I
[systems]{.underline} of one or both of the belligerents [could become
severely degraded.]{.underline} It is, therefore, not just U.S.
nonnuclear strikes against China or Russia that could prove escalatory;
Chinese or Russian strikes against American C3I assets could also---a
possibility that scholars have scarcely even considered since the end of
the Cold War.9 Two escalation mechanisms that have not been previously
discussed in the academic literature are largely responsible for the
increasing risk. First, **[the target might interpret nonnuclear
attacks]{.underline}** against its dual-use C3I assets [**that were
motivated by conventional warfighting goals as preparations for nuclear
use.**]{.underline} It might respond to such "misinterpreted warning,"
to coin a term, by trying to deter the nuclear strike it believed might
be coming or to mitigate its potentially calamitous consequences. Such
efforts, which might include provocative nonnuclear operations to
protect remaining C3I assets (such as strikes against anti-satellite
weapons deep within the adversary\'s territory) accompanied, perhaps, by
nuclear threats, could prove highly escalatory. [These escalation
pressures could arise even if the recipient of misinterpreted warning
were not concerned about the survivability of its nuclear forces---a key
distinction from crisis instability.]{.underline} Second, a state with a
damage-limitation doctrine would rely on sophisticated C3I capabilities
to locate and destroy its opponent\'s nuclear forces and conduct missile
defense operations. [If these dual-use enabling capabilities were
subject to attack in a conventional conflict---or even if their
possessor feared they might be---**the state could worry that its window
of opportunity for conducting effective damage-limitation operations
might have closed by the time the war turned nuclear**.]{.underline} In
this case, [the state might take escalatory measures]{.underline} to
protect its C3I system [or even initiate counterforce operations
preemptively. **This escalation mechanism**]{.underline}, which might be
termed the "damage-limitation window," is distinct from crisis
instability because it is driven by the state\'s desire to hold an
opponent\'s nuclear forces at risk, not to protect its own. It is
distinct from misinterpreted warning because it [**could operate even if
the state did not believe that nuclear use by an adversary might be
imminent;** the state would only have to believe that such escalation
was possible later on.]{.underline} An additional implication of C3I
entanglement is that [the risks of crisis instability are more serious
than portrayed in the academic literature.]{.underline} Scholarly
warnings about crisis instability have focused on the potential for U.S.
nonnuclear operations to degrade Chinese nuclear forces, but have also
identified the risk of inadvertent threats to China\'s nuclear C3I
capabilities located in the theater of operations.10 These threats have
received particular attention since the United States acknowledged, in
2013, that it seeks to defeat potential adversaries\'
antiaccess/area-denial capabilities by holding relevant C3I assets at
risk as part of the concept formerly known as AirSea Battle (which was
renamed, in 2015, as the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the
Global Commons and has since been further developed).11 If overlap
exists between the communication systems for China\'s land-based nuclear
and nonnuclear missiles, as some analysts have suggested, China could
mistake U.S. strikes designed to disable its nonnuclear missiles as an
attack against its nuclear forces.12 Entanglement, however, has created
other potential triggers for crisis instability. The United States, for
example, has---or could develop---incentives to launch nonnuclear
kinetic attacks against existing and probable future dual-use Chinese or
Russian early-warning capabilities, including over-the-horizon radars,
ballistic missile early-warning radars (BMEWRs), and early-warning
satellites, that are located outside the theater of operations.13
(Kinetic weapons, which often use explosive warheads, aim to damage or
destroy targets by transferring kinetic energy to them through physical
contact; non-kinetic weapons include directed energy and cyber
capabilities.) Moreover, Russian strikes on the United States could
precipitate crisis instability if U.S. communication aircraft
(currently, the United States\' most survivable means to communicate
with its nuclear forces) become vulnerable. [**Entanglement could
catalyze escalation in any major U.S.-Chinese or U.S.-Russian
conventional conflict, irrespective of its origins.**]{.underline} That
said, for the sake of concreteness, the kind of U.S.-Chinese conflict
that forms the backdrop to this article would most likely begin with a
Chinese attempt to reunify with Taiwan by force (either unprovoked or
because the government of Taiwan had declared independence), followed by
U.S. intervention on behalf of Taiwan. The most probable cause of a
major U.S.-Russian conflict would be the invasion and occupation of one
or more of the Baltic states by Russia, followed by a U.S.-led
counterattack to liberate them. In both cases, [fighting could spread
from the theater in which it started.]{.underline} There would, of
course, be important differences between the escalation dynamics in a
U.S.-Chinese and U.S.-Russian conflict. Nevertheless, there would also
be important similarities that help illustrate the general nature of the
risks stemming from entanglement. In particular, [**entanglement could
not only precipitate the use of nuclear weapons directly, but could also
frustrate efforts to manage nonnuclear escalation, thus raising the risk
of nuclear use later on**.]{.underline} Early in a conflict, for
example, to emphasize its limited war aims, the United States might
refrain from conducting nonnuclear strikes beyond a certain distance
into an adversary\'s territory. Subsequently, if the United States
became worried that key C3I satellites were at risk, it might believe
that it had to attack Chinese or Russian anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons
located further beyond the border.

### Impact -- Russia 

#### Risk of cyber escalation with Russia is massive and goes nuclear -- prioritize this impact because cognitive bias underestimates it, and deterrence can't solve it.

Today, that old dread of disaster has all but disappeared, as have the
systems that helped preclude it. But [[the]{.mark} actual [threat of
nuclear catastrophe is much greater than we
realize.]{.mark}]{.underline} Diplomacy and a desire for global peace
have given way to complacency and a false sense of security that nuclear
escalation is outside the realm of possibility. [That leaves us
unprepared for---and highly vulnerable to---a nuclear attack from
Russia.]{.underline} The most recent sign of American complacency was
the death, a few weeks ago, of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty---a pivotal 1987 agreement that introduced intrusive on-site
inspection provisions, destroyed an entire class of dangerous weaponry,
and convinced both Washington and Moscow that the other wanted strategic
stability more than strategic advantage. The New START treaty, put in
place during the Obama administration, appears headed for a similar fate
in 2021. In fact, [nearly [all the key U.S.-Russian arms control and
confidence-building provisions of the Cold War era are dead or on life
support]{.mark}]{.underline}, with little effort underway to update or
replace them. Meanwhile, [U.S. officials from both parties are focused
not on how we might avoid nuclear catastrophe but on showing how tough
they can look]{.underline} against a revanchist Russia and its leader,
Vladimir Putin. Summit meetings between White House and Kremlin leaders,
once viewed as opportunities for peace, are now seen as dangerous
temptations to indulge in Munich-style appeasement, the cardinal sin of
statecraft. [American policymakers worry more about "going
wobbly,"]{.underline} as Margaret Thatcher once put it, [than about a
march of folly into inadvertent war.]{.underline} President Donald
Trump's suggestion that the United States and Russia might explore ways
to manage their differences diplomatically has produced mostly
head-scratching and condemnation. In my more than 25 years of government
experience working on Russia matters, I've seen that three misguided
assumptions underlie how the United States got to this point. The first
is that [American [policymakers think that because neither side wants
nuclear war, then]{.mark} such a [war is]{.mark} very [unlikely]{.mark}
to occur.]{.underline} Russia would be foolish, we reason, to cross
swords with the powerful U.S. military and risk its own
self-destruction, and many [[Americans find it hard to imagine
that]{.mark} modern [cyber duels]{.mark}, proxy battles, information
operations and economic warfare [might]{.mark} somehow [erupt into
direct nuclear attacks.]{.mark}]{.underline} If the Cold War ended
peacefully, the thinking goes, why should America worry that a new
shadow war with a much less formidable Russia will end any differently?
[But wars do not always begin by design. Just as they did in 1914, [a
vicious circle of clashing]{.mark} geopolitical [ambitions, distorted
perceptions]{.mark} of each other's intent, new and poorly understood
technologies, [and disappearing rules]{.mark} of the game [could combine
to produce a disaster]{.mark} that neither side wants nor
expects.]{.underline} In fact, **[[cyber
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, artificial intelligence, advanced
hypersonic weapons delivery systems and antisatellite weaponry [**[are
making the U.S.-Russian shadow war]{.mark} much [more]{.mark} complex
and [dangerous than the]{.mark} old [Cold War]{.mark} competition. [They
are blurring]{.mark} traditional [lines between espionage and warfare,
entangling nuclear and conventional weaponry, and erasing old
distinctions between offensive and defensive operations.]{.mark}**
Whereas the development of nuclear weaponry]{.underline} in the Cold War
[produced the concept of mutually assured destruction and had a
restraining effect, in the cyber arena, playing offense is increasingly
seen as the best defense. And in a highly connected world in which
financial networks, commercial operations, media platforms, and nuclear
command and control systems are all linked in some way, [escalation from
the cyber world into the physical domain is a serious danger. Cyber
tech]{.mark}nology [is]{.mark} also [magnifying fears of]{.mark} our
[adversaries']{.mark} strategic [intentions while prompting questions
about]{.mark} whether warning systems can detect incoming attacks and
[whether weapons will fire when]{.mark} buttons are [pushed. This makes
containing a crisis]{.mark} that might arise between U.S. and Russian
forces over Ukraine, Iran or anything else [much more difficult. It is
not hard to imagine a crisis scenario]{.mark} in which [Russia cyber
operators gain access to a satellite system that controls]{.mark} both
[U.S.]{.mark} conventional and [nuclear weapons
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, leaving the American side uncertain about
whether the intrusion is meant to gather information about U.S. war
preparations or to disable our ability to conduct nuclear strikes.
[[This could cause the U.S.]{.mark} president [to]{.mark} wonder whether
he [face]{.mark}s [**an urgent "use** it or lose it" nuclear]{.mark}
launch [decision.]{.mark}]{.underline} It doesn't help that the lines of
communication between the United States and Russia necessary for
managing such situations are all but severed.

#### Cyber ASAT attacks escalate to conventional war

Many dubbed the Gulf War of 1991 the "first space war" due to the US
Armed Forces' extensive use of satellites (Anson Bt and Cummings 2008).
[The current war in Ukraine might be remembered as the first space-cyber
war]{.underline}. It is [demonstrating the potential]{.underline} [and
temptation of targeting space assets during an armed
conflict]{.underline}. The cyberwar in Ukraine is mostly secret, playing
out in the shadows, as inconspicuous as it is insidious. However, we
already know that on the day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Viasat,
a US-based provider of high-speed satellite broadband services, suffered
an outage, which disrupted the internet services it provides to the
Ukrainian armed forces, intelligence service and police (Rid 2022). In
addition, Russia allegedly jammed GPS signals locally in Ukraine,
disabling the ability of Ukrainians to determine their location or
navigate and guide weapons to their targets (Hitchens 2022). Moreover,
Dmitry [Rogozin]{.underline}, the head of the Russian space agency
Roscosmos, [said]{.underline} that [Russia will treat any hacking of its
satellites as a casus beli]{.underline} (Reuters 2022) ---
[justification for war. This provides a stark demonstration of the
explosive potential of the space-cyber nexus: launching a cyberattack on
space assets can trigger a response in the form of conventional warfare.
This Russian statement may become a new customary norm, as it builds on
previous statements and actions regarding cyberattacks in
general]{.underline}. In 2011, the United States released its
"International Strategy for Cyberspace," which declared it would
"respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as it would to any other threat
to our country" (The White House 2011, 14). Israel was the first country
to take this type of action: in 2019, it attacked a building in Gaza
from which Hamas hackers allegedly launched or tried to launch
cyberattacks against Israeli targets (Israel Defense Forces 2019).

[Commercial space companies have also become embroiled in the war in
Ukraine]{.underline}. After Google Maps marked the traffic jam that was
the invading Russian army, it turned off live traffic updates in Ukraine
that might be used to target troops or refugees (Meaker 2022). Satellite
imagery from commercial companies is used to shed light on the unfolding
events and situation on the ground, including destruction of targets, as
exemplified by Maxar Technologies' satellite images of the 40-mile
Russian military convoy en route to Kyiv (Sky News 2022). Moreover,
commercial companies' satellite imagery is also used by the Ukrainian
army. MDA, a Canadian commercial space company, provides the Ukrainian
government with satellite imagery, which the Ukrainian military uses to
pinpoint Russian troops (Wark 2022). SpaceX's Starlink announced the
provision of space-based internet service in Ukraine (Jin 2022), amid
problems faced by traditional suppliers, and, after having its satellite
signal jammed (Swinhoe 2022), declared a new focus on cyber defense
(Malik 2022). [What this war did not yet see, and is less likely to see,
is the physical destruction of satellites, although Russia has such
capabilities, as revealed again by its anti-satellite test in November
2021 (Gohd 2021), as do the United States, China and India. Indeed, the
Ukraine war demonstrates that cyberattacks are the main contra-space
mode of warfare]{.underline}.

### Impact -- China

#### Statements by the PLA and key military experts prove China will prioritize counterspace tactics in the event of conflict with the US

Throughout the 1990s, even as the Chinese view of future warfare and the
role of information was evolving, the PLA was also developing its views
on space warfare. [Assessing other peoples' wars, the Chinese concluded
that future wars would include space warfare as an integral part of
operations.]{.underline} This was not so much because of the importance
of space systems---due to their growing role in providing the
information support necessary for the successful conduct of future local
wars---but more because of their performance and requirement under
modern, high-technology conditions or informationized conditions.
Indeed, [PLA assessments of American and Russian military
operations]{.underline}, beginning with the use of space in the first
Gulf War, [concluded that space-based information played an outsize
role. Therefore, in the event of a conflict, the PRC must strive to deny
an adversary the ability to use space freely.]{.underline} In
particular, the PRC's shift towards joint operations, which began in the
1990s, highlighted the importance of space. As envisioned by the PLA,
joint operations would involve multiple services operating together
across significant distances. The Gulf War, for example, sprawled across
some 140 million square kilometers, and included forces ranging from
armored units to aircraft carriers and long-range bombers (Wang & Zhang,
2000, p. 400). The ability to coordinate such diverse forces spread
across a variety of domains would therefore require not only extensive
communications, but also precise navigation and positioning information,
both for units and for the growing plethora of precision munitions.
Joint operations were therefore seen as requiring the ability to command
and control operations across not only the traditional domains of land,
sea, and air, but increasingly outer space. In this light, space
capabilities were recognized as playing an essential role in any effort
to wage a "local war under modern, high-tech conditions." [According to
PLA estimates, the 70 satellites that were ultimately brought to bear
against Iraq provided the US with 90% of its strategic intelligence, and
carried 70% of all transmitted data for Coalition forces]{.underline}
(Gao, 2001, p. 54). Indeed, these assets were the first to be employed,
since they were essential for the success of all subsequent campaign
activities. As one Chinese analyst observed, "Before the troops and
horses move, the satellites are already moving" (Gao, 2005). PRC
writings from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s reflect a steady
evolution from seeing space as important to seeing it as decisive (See
PLA Encyclopedia Committee, 1997, 2002). Given the importance of such
support from space systems, victory in future "local wars under modern,
high-technology conditions" was already recognized as requiring not only
one's own unfettered access to space, but also the denial of the same
ability to the adversary. [By preventing the enemy from obtaining the
amount of information they required, it would be far more difficult for
them to coordinate their forces and operations.]{.underline} As
important, [by preventing them from operating in the manner to which
they were accustomed (and had trained), they would be far less efficient
and flexible, and therefore more vulnerable to Chinese
actions.]{.underline} In effect, by degrading adversary space
capabilities, the enemy would suffer from a slower OODA
(observe-orient-decide-act) loop. [Space information support was
therefore increasingly seen as complemented by offensive space
operations]{.underline} (which somewhat aligns with Western concepts of
counter-space operations). This shift may also have been a reflection of
the ongoing development of Chinese concepts of future warfare. As part
of the PLA's "new historic missions," Hu Jintao in 2004 made clear that
the PLA must secure China's interests in outer space, as well as the
electromagnetic spectrum (2004). The incorporation ofthe space domain
into the specific range of PLA responsibilities reflected the steadily
growing emphasis placed upon establishing space dominance, as part of
the larger effort to secure information dominance. Indeed, as the PLA
shifted from preparing to fight "local wars under modern,
high-technology conditions" to fighting "local wars under
informationized conditions," space was increasingly seen as part of
those "informationized conditions." As [PLA writings]{.underline} note,
"informationized conditions" did not simply refer to computers and
cyberwarfare. Instead, it involves the acquisition, transmission, and
exploitation of all forms of information. Space plays a central role in
all these tasks. In the 2006 edition of The Science of Campaigns, it is
[specifically stated that "the space domain daily is becoming a vital
battle-space.... Space has already become the new strategic high
ground"]{.underline} (Zhang, 2006, p. 87). Similarly, in the 2013
edition of The Science of Military Strategy, [space is deemed the "high
ground in wars under informationized conditions,"]{.underline} tied to
the struggles in networks space and the electromagnetic spectrum as key
future battlegrounds (Academy of Military Science Military Strategy
Research Office, 2013, p. 146-147).In the Chinese conception, space is
important for the advantage it confers with regards to the ability to
collect, transmit, and exploit information, rather than for its own
sake. As other Chinese analysts conclude, "space operations will be a
core means of establishing information advantage" (Yuan, 2008, p. 324).
[Chinese military planners are therefore preparing to undertake a range
of space actions]{.underline}, should that be necessary. That readiness
is facilitated by the reality that the PLA runs China's space
facilities.12 These include a range of anti-satellite tests in 2007,
2010, and 2013. This last test is especially notable, as it is assessed
as demonstrating an ability to threaten targets as far as the
geosynchronous belt, over 26,000 miles away (Weeden, 2014). This is the
first time that any nation has tested a weapon explicitly intended to
hold satellites in that orbit at risk. The ability to hold at risk the
entire range of orbital regimes is tied to the Chinese emphasis on
establishing "information dominance" in order to win future conflicts.
Chinese analysts have long recognized, since at least the first Gulf War
twenty-five years ago, that space is a key means of providing
information support to terrestrial forces. Consequently, the emphasis
upon establishing space dominance, as part of the struggle for
information dominance, has become more explicit. [Chinese authors
believe that without space dominance, one cannot obtain information
dominance and aerial dominance, and therefore one cannot achieve land or
maritime dominance. Space will therefore inevitably be a battleground,
if only in order to deny an adversary the ability to use it
freely]{.underline} (Ye, 2007, p. 154). [Consequently, the space arena
will be one of the very first scenes of conflict, as the two sides
struggle for control of space.]{.underline} Neither side can afford to
neglect this theater, as it will be a central determinant of who will
secure information dominance (Chi & Xiao, 2005, p. 38-39). Space
dominance entails not only the ability to provide information support to
the PLA, but also to deny an adversary the ability to exploit space to
gain information. [The American reliance on space systems, in
particular, has been remarked upon in various Chinese military
writings.]{.underline} Nor is American dependence upon space unique, in
the Chinese view. PLA writings indicate that they are also closely
observing other nations' space developments. Russian space developments
in particular seem to garner heavy Chinese attention. The Chinese
military textbook Military Astronautics discusses Russian as well as
American aerospace forces (Chang, 2005, p. 219-220). The 2013 edition of
The Science of Military Strategy observes that Russia has made space a
major focus of its military refurbishment effort, and that Moscow has
increased its investments in the space sector as the Russian economy has
improved (Academy of Military Science Military StrategyResearch Office,
2013, p. 180).

Cyberthreats. [The PLA emphasizes offensive cyberspace capabilities as a
major component of integrated warfare and could use its cyberwarfare
capabilities to support military operations against spacebased
assets.]{.underline}239,240 For example, [the PLA could employ its
cyberattack elements to establish information dominance in the early
stages of a conflict]{.underline} to constrain an adversary's actions or
slow its mobilization and deployment [by targeting network-based
command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance]{.underline} (C4ISR); logistics; and commercial
activities. [The PLA also conducts cyberespionage against foreign space

#### China will first strike our satellite systems with cyber attacks at the start of conflict

China's concepts of future warfare calls for operational and tactical
offense in the context of strategic defense. [Should China decide to
engage in armed conflict, it will attempt to use]{.underline} a
combination of strike weapons, submarines, [anti-satellite]{.underline},
and [cyber-attacks to quickly overwhelm opponent forces in the theater
of operations. China's military prefers to strike first---preemptively
and without warning.]{.underline} The ambiguity and reinterpretation of
China's "No First Use" policy reflects this. If the intent is to
overwhelm an opponent rapidly, then piecemeal deployment and gradual
escalation undercut the chances for success. [In the event of conflict,
early attacks on American space assets would be central to China's rapid
escalation. China]{.underline} (like our other opponents), [believes the
US military is dependent on space services and China has developed means
to damage]{.underline} or cripple [reconnaissance, communications, and
navigation using both kinetic and non-kinetic attacks.]{.underline}
Having crossed the use-of-force threshold, the next escalatory threshold
will be whether to attempt to geographically limit conflict or to strike
the American homeland, actions that may produce retaliatory risk that is
disproportionate any military benefit such attacks may provide. Chinese
strategists are concerned with "war termination," e.g. ending armed
conflict in ways that advance China's interests, but finding a way to
terminate a war with the US on favorable terms may present them with
unsolvable problems. While the opening phase conflict might see China
gain swift local advantage, this would be attractive only if China
assumes that any American response will be limited and of short
duration, and this assumption makes sense only if there was a collapse
of US political resolve. A short, sharp, regional conflict could follow
China's timetable for successful conflict termination, but it is a bold
assumption that the US would not continue any conflict until it had
inflicted significant losses on Chinese forces and regained military
advantage. While "gray zone' efforts by China can circumvent America
military power, open conflict would bring this power into play in ways
that would put Chinese naval, air and space assets at considerable (and
at least for now, unacceptable) risk. Chinese space activities to date
have been demonstrations of prowess and national strength while
developing operational capabilities, including anti-space capabilities
targeted at the United States. [China will continue to develop
anti-satellite capabilities]{.underline} (and other advanced military
capabilities) [to narrow the scope for US action and to decrease the
likelihood ofUS success if conflict arises.]{.underline} However
coercion in space has been difficult to manage and the use of force in
space will occur only when China has decided upon armed conflict,
something it will for now try to avoid. Space (and cyberspace) challenge
efforts at controlling escalatory risk through geographic limitations to
conflict. [Chinese writings refer to space as the "commanding heights in
strategic competition,"]{.underline}11 one of the new technologies that
(along with cyber) have expanded the domain for conflict. [Space
occupies an anomalous position, with American space assets providing
tempting and vulnerable targets whose destruction would provide real
operational advantage]{.underline}, but that also bring the risk of
making any conflict "strategic" rather than the limited war China would
prefer. [An attack on an American space asset orbiting over China,
producing no casualties or dramatic photos, may seem ideal as a
demonstration of nationalist resolve.]{.underline} A demonstration of
the ability to inflict harm in space without damaging a satellite may be
even more attractive as a warning to potential opponents about the
danger of conflict with China. However, the experience of the 2007
anti-satellite test, which was badly coordinated within the Chinese
government, provoked an unexpectedly hostile global reaction, and led to
a US counter-demonstration, show the limits of coercion in space.

#### The US would interpret Chinese ASAT use as preparation for nuclear strikes

**Acton 18** \[James, Jessica T. Mathews Chair and co-director of the
Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, "Escalation through Entanglement: How the Vulnerability of
Command-and-Control Systems Raises the Risks of an Inadvertent Nuclear
War," *International Security*,

accessed 07/05/22, JCR\]

That said, [the United States could still interpret Chinese attacks
against its early-warning system as preparations for limited nuclear
strikes intended to terrify the United States]{.underline} into
terminating a conflict on terms not too unfavorable to Beijing. Fairly
or not, [Washington does not have complete confidence in the reliability
of China\'s no-first-use pledge.]{.underline}51 In particular, skeptics
typically argue that [Beijing would be most likely to abandon this
pledge if China were in danger of losing a war over
Taiwan]{.underline}---an outcome that could jeopardize the continued
rule of the Chinese Communist Party.52 [If, in this circumstance, China
attacked critical U.S. early-warning assets]{.underline}---satellites,
in particular---[in an effort to help its conventional ballistic
missiles penetrate U.S. defenses, Washington might conclude that
desperate Chinese leaders were preparing limited nuclear
strikes]{.underline}, against either the United States or regional
targets.53 Again, much would depend on context. The likelihood of
misinterpreted warning would probably increase if, in addition to
attacking dual-use U.S. enabling capabilities, China had dispersed or
alerted nuclear-armed missiles. Although this step could be a standard
defensive precaution to protect the missiles\' survivability in a major
conflict, it might also exacerbate concerns in Washington about the
possibility of Chinese first use. Some nuclear-armed medium-range DF-21A
ballistic missiles appear to be targeting U.S. assets in the West
Pacific.54 The alerting of these missiles could be seen by the United
States, therefore, as preparations for regional nuclear strikes. The
alerting of China\'s ICBM force, meanwhile, could be interpreted as an
attempt to threaten the U.S. homeland and so deter nuclear retaliation
to Chinese first use against regional targets. [The escalation pressures
might be more serious still if China had conducted extensive attacks
against U.S. ISR assets, denying the United States contextual
information that might be helpful in interpreting Chinese intentions
correctly.]{.underline}

### Impact -- GNSS

#### Attack on the Global Navigation Satellite System ripples across sectors, sparks panic

**Cesari et al 21** \[Laetitia, Consultant at the UN Institute for
Disarmament Studies, "Space as NATO's Operational Domain: The Case of
the Cyber Threats against GNSS," 72nd International Astronautical

The Global Positioning System was originally designed as a military
system, to meet tactical and strategic needs on the battlefield, during
the Cold War Era. The term traditionally refers to the North American
global positioning system, or satellite positioning system, while GNSS
refers to the International Multi-Constellation Satellite System.
Therefore, [GNSS as an umbrella term typically includes GPS, GLONASS,
Baidu, Galileo, and any other constellation system.]{.underline} GNSS
and GPS work together, however the GNSScompatible equipment can use
navigational satellites from other networks beyond the GPS system, which
is the main difference from GPS, and more satellites means increased
receiver accuracy and reliability. [The GNSS can be targeted by
cyberattacks]{.underline} via the command connection or ground station,
since an unencrypted command link can expose the satellite\'s
capabilities to an opponent, or a ground station could be hacked
directly, allowing the ground station to influence satellite control or
data. The ITU, while recognizing that "Member States retain their entire
freedom with regard to military radio installations" \[44\] these
installations must, so far as possible, take measures to prevent harmful
interference \[45\]. Therefore, when assessing the interference risks
associated with conflict zones or planning military exercises, ITU
invites Member States to consider that the use of satellite-based
systems can potentially be impacted beyond that zone, and therefore, an
enhanced civilmilitary coordination is required. NATO's ballistic
missile defence capability is being built around a command-and-control
system that enables five key functions: planning, monitoring,
informationsharing, interception and consequence management 12 . The
security of the system relies on three key elements, confidentiality,
integrity and availability. industrial security is paramount (inc also
supply chains)" \[2\]. [The consequences of cyber-attacks on space
missions are aggravated because of component satellites' augmented
connectivity and use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in contemporary
space systems. The potential impacts of an attack on a communication
satellite can endanger national security by generating widespread
disruptions to communication channels, not only national level, but also
across widespread geographies, cross countries, and cause
panic.]{.underline} The attacker can infiltrate the network without
being detected and remain undetected. Cyber threats may target different
components of a space mission: the ground segment, the space segment,
and the link segment. The vulnerabilities stem from the ground segments;
mostly generated from network components and the receivers (which
receive the data from the satellite). The threats may also target
hardware of satellites in the supply chain, and compromise ground units
at a later stage \[46\]. "[Cyber vulnerabilities undermine confidence in
the performance of strategic systems. As a result, rising uncertainty in
information and analysis continues to impact the credibility of
deterrence and strategic stability]{.underline}. Loss of trust in
technology also has implications for determining the source of a
malicious attack (attribution), strategic calculus in crisis
decision-making and may increase the risk of misperception" \[47\]
Ground stations - how can we prevent threats? Preventive method and
time-based method. Previous attack on ISS. [GNSS are specifically
vulnerable to hostile cyber operations because of the very low power of
their signals and services and constitute potential primary targets in
future wars because of their importance not only for military
operations, but also for critical national infrastructure and key
economic sectors.]{.underline} Unlike physical attacks they are not
likely to cause major damages to the satellite navigation system. Recent
cyber operations against GNSS were jamming and spoofing \[48\] although
other types of attacks such as hacking or eavesdropping of
communications satellite systems, are also technically possible.

#### Disruption of the GNSS system would instantly destroy the global economy and gut virtually every critical infrastructure sector

For decades, America's satellites had circled Earth at a largely safe
remove from the vicissitudes of geopolitics. An informal global
moratorium on the testing of anti-satellite weapons had held since 1985;
the intervening decades had been a period of post--Cold War peace---and
unquestioned American supremacy---high overhead. During those decades,
[satellites had become linchpins of the American military apparatus and
the global economy.]{.underline} By 2007, ships at sea and warplanes in
the air had grown reliant on instant satellite communications with
ground stations thousands of miles away. Government forecasters relied
on weather satellites; intelligence analysts relied on high-­resolution
imagery to anticipate and track adversaries the world over. [**GPS had
become perhaps the single most indispensable global system ever designed
by humans---the infrastructure upon which the rest of the world's
infrastructure is based.** (Fourteen of the 16 infrastructure sectors
designated as critical by the Department of Homeland Security, like
energy and financial services, rely on GPS for their
operation.)]{.underline} Now, Shelton feared, all those satellites
overhead had become so many huge, unarmored, billion-dollar sitting
ducks. In the decade since China's first successful anti-satellite
missile test, Shelton's premonition has largely come true: Everything
has changed in space. A secretive, pitched arms race has opened up
between the US, China, Russia, and, to a lesser extent, North Korea. The
object of the race: to devise more and better ways to quickly cripple
your adversary's satellites. After decades of uncontested US supremacy,
multinational cooperation, and a diplomatic consensus on reserving space
for peaceful uses, military officials have begun referring to Earth's
orbit as a new "warfighting domain." On the ground, the military is
starting to retrain pilots, ship captains, and ground troops in
fail-safe forms of navigation that don't rely on GPS---like celestial
navigation. The US military must relearn how to fight "unwired" and
defend itself in space. "We knew how to do that, and somehow we forgot,"
General John E. Hyten, the head of US Strategic Command, said in 2015.
When former director of national intelligence James Clapper left office
at the end of the Obama administration, he told me that the increasing
sophistication of America's adversaries in space was one of the top
three strategic threats he worried about. Clapper's successor, Dan
Coats, warned last spring that "Russia and China remain committed to
developing capabilities to challenge perceived adversaries in space,
especially the United States." Since he took office, President Trump has
dropped numerous hints of the warnings he's evidently getting from
military and intelligence leaders. During a spring livestream with
astronauts aboard the International Space Station, he alluded, obliquely
and without context, to the "tremendous military applications in space."
And he has repeatedly floated the idea of creating a new branch of the
armed forces specifically for celestial combat---culminating last week
with a speech out-and-out ordering the Joint Chiefs of Staff to begin
developing plans for a new "Space Force." But if space is indeed
becoming a war-­fighting domain, it's important to understand the stakes,
not just for America's strategic standing but for the species. [**A
Russo-Sino-American space war could very well end with** a ~~crippled~~
\[wrecked\] **global economy, inoperable infrastructure, and a planet
shrouded by the orbiting fragments** of pulverized satellites---**which,
by the way, could hinder us all on Earth**]{.underline} until we figured
out a way of cleaning them up. In the aftermath of such a conflict, it
might be years before we could restore new constellations of satellites
to orbit. [Preparing for orbital war has fast become a priority of the
US military, but the more urgent priority is figuring out how to prevent
it.]{.underline} GROWING UP IN Oklahoma City, William Shelton dreamed of
becoming a pilot. He got as far as the Air Force Academy before he
discovered his eyes weren't good enough. So instead he became an
astronomical engineer. In 1976 he began serving as a launch facility
manager at Vandenberg Air Force Base, the military's oldest space and
missile launch base, perched on the California coast north of Santa
Barbara. He arrived just as the Air Force was beginning to understand
how crucial space would be to its future: The nation's first
early-warning satellites had been put in orbit with the intention of
tracking Soviet missile launches, and satellite imagery was becoming
increasingly critical to intelligence gathering. Shelton's poor
eyesight, it turned out, had led him to the center of the Air Force's
new frontier. In August 1990, Shelton, then a young lieutenant colonel,
took command of the 2nd Space Operations Squadron in Colorado. When he
arrived at his post, the Air Force was busy building a new constellation
of satellites---launching new ones from Cape Canaveral in Florida every
few months to help fill out what he was told would ultimately be a
global system aimed at helping the US improve its navigation and
increase the precision of its bombs and missiles. This was the new
Global Positioning System, and one of Shelton's first duties at "2Sops"
was to build support and enthusiasm for the new effort. To impress
visitors (including the brass), he carried around a demo GPS unit that
weighed 10 pounds, cost \$3,000, and could tell America's soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and Marines exactly where they were on the surface of
the planet. The power of the new system that 2Sops ran was proven faster
than anyone imagined. The Gulf War caused a rush of final preparations
to get GPS ready for battle. Around 2:30 am on January 17, 1991,
GPS-equipped helicopters snuck into Iraq, using the technology to guide
themselves through the darkened desert and knock out air defense radars.
The first bombing campaign of the war had begun. Reporters marveled at
precision-­guided bombs zeroing in on their targets and cruise missiles
appearing to turn street corners to hit the right buildings. Shelton had
a front-row seat to this transformation. As the technology has improved,
so has the precision of GPS. The system originally provided accuracy to
within 17 yards; with it, you could pinpoint a specific copse of pine
trees. Today, if you're using a smartphone, it can generally locate an
object to within five yards---a resolution fine enough to locate a pair
of pine trees within that copse. Soon it could be able to zero in on a
pine cone: Research from UC Riverside has demonstrated that the latest
tech is reliable to within an inch. And research has shown that
1-millimeter accuracy might be eventually possible---which means that
the system could locate an individual seed inside that pine cone. Today,
troops on the ground use GPS to navigate foreign streets; drone pilots
can program a flight plan from thousands of miles away. And because GPS
satellites also house America's detection system for nuclear
detonations, we rely on them to tell us if North Korea launches a
nuclear weapon, and to tell our missiles and bombs where to find their
targets. "When you look at our American way of war, the strategy is
largely underpinned by space assets---navigation, early warning,
timing," Shelton says. And that's just the military. The creators of GPS
probably never intended for the system to become the backbone of daily
life, but it has. I visited Colorado while reporting this story and
tried to keep tabs on everything I did that relied on GPS. There were
the obvious navigational moments---my Uber ride to the airport, my
American Airlines flight to Denver, my own Google Maps--guided drive in
a rental car to Schriever Air Force Base, outside Colorado Springs. But
there were also less obvious instances, like the phone calls I made
along the way (cellular networks rely on GPS data to keep their stations
synchronized), my stop at the ATM (banks use GPS to track deposits and
withdrawals), and the fill-up at the gas station (the credit card system
also relies on GPS). Moreover, GPS is no longer the world's sole
geolocating mechanism. Russia, China, and the European Union have now
all either deployed or begun working on their own full constellations of
navigation satellites, ensuring that they won't have to rely on the US
system. It also means that, in the early moments of a war, it's a fair
bet that satellites---the other guy's satellites---could be among the
first targets. DURING THE COLD War, a US army mountain outpost in the
Fulda Gap, the shortest route between East and West Germany, served as
an early warning trip wire for a Soviet invasion of Europe. If Russian
tanks ever made a surprise attack, NATO planners knew that the soldiers
there would likely be the first to find out. Today, the members of 2Sops
play a similar role. Deep inside the squat, beige, windowless Building
400 at Schriever Air Force Base---the destination I had plugged into
Google Maps during my trip to Colorado---10 people at a time remotely
operate the heavenly constellation of GPS satellites that guide Tomahawk
cruise missiles to their targets, deliver Lyft passengers to their
destinations, and help farmers cultivate their crops. They also watch
out for any shocks or attacks on the system. The average GPS operators
are in their mid-twenties. During one recent shift, the entire Global
Positioning System was being operated by two 19-year-old airmen (who,
the Air Force emphasizes, are rigorously trained). Their commander, US
Air Force lieutenant colonel Peter Norsky, is in his mid-thirties.
Together, they watch over the roughly three dozen GPS satellites,
troubleshooting the geolocation system and minding the quirks of each
orbiting craft---this one's damaged solar panels, that one's balky
communications links---as if they were remotely tending a stable full of
temperamental horses. As integral as GPS is to daily life, the way it
actually works is little understood by most people outside of Schriever
Air Force Base. [Fundamentally, the function of GPS is to provide the
globe with a shared clock. GPS satellites allow phone companies to keep
their systems in sync, battleships to chart open waters, and ATMs to
time-stamp their transactions]{.underline} by triangulating signals from
overhead and measuring how long it takes those signals from different
satellites to reach a GPS receiver. The system works by making daily
calculations, employing Newtonian physics and Einsteinian relativity, to
minutely tweak the time broadcast from each GPS satellite as it moves
through space---the high-tech version of tuning your grandfather clock
to within 100-­billionths of a second. Time is, after all, relative; as
of January, the time in space was 18 seconds ahead of Earth's
"Coordinated Universal Time," since space doesn't recognize the leap
seconds that scientists add to terrestrial time to account for the
planet's slowing rotation. Additionally, the time-keeping device on each
satellite gives a subtly different reading, the result of variations in
their atomic clocks, which tell time by measuring the precise
oscillations of an atom. (Some GPS satellites use rubidium atoms, which
are highly accurate day to day; some use cesium, which is more accurate
over long stretches.) **[Any malfunction in the GPS system threatens to
plunge the global economy into chaos.]{.underline}** Fortunately those
glitches are rare, but they're not unheard of. **[On January 25,
2016]{.underline}**, one of 2Sops' flight commanders, Captain Aaron
Blain, was awoken by a call from work in the middle of the night. User
reports from around the country suggested that **[the
system]{.underline}**'s precision had "wobbled," making measurements
increasingly inaccurate. Blain raced to Schriever in his Ford pickup and
found that the constellation's timing [**was off by about 13
microseconds.** It was an infinitesimal number---over 25,000 times
shorter than the blink of an eye---but for the finely tuned GPS it was a
yawning crevice. **Left uncorrected, the glitch could have ricocheted
through the global economy, corrupting not just driving directions but
stock trades too.**]{.underline}

### AT: Economy bad now 

#### Inflation on the decline -- but new shocks can stop the positive trends

[Covid inflation has been an unusual confluence of extremely high
demand, driven by enormous stimulus, and simultaneous supply bottlenecks
in product, commodity, and labor markets]{.underline}. [It was more
persistent than widely expected because new shocks kept
coming]{.underline}. Initially, it was harmless "bounce" inflation from
low prices at the start of the pandemic. Later came the supply
bottlenecks; then the energy surge of last year; an enormous scramble
for labor; the unexpected war in Ukraine; and the economic lockdown in
China this spring. Inflation will remain hard to predict --- those who
warned against inflation early did not do so because they anticipated
this sequence of shocks. **[While it's not over, the period of maximum
stress is likely behind us. Demand is cooling. Inventories have been
rebuilding healthily. Workers are returning to the labor force. This
will allow inflation figures to moderate throughout the rest of the
year. Another signal of moderating inflation is firms' waning pricing
power.]{.underline}** Firm profits grew strongly in 2021 ---
microeconomic proof of inflation since firms were clearly able to pass
through price pressures to consumers. But that is less and less likely
to persist. Consider that firms usually face a tradeoff between raising
prices and losing market share. As the economy reopened, that tradeoff
was suspended because of high demand and low supply. [But as demand
slows and inventories rebuild, pricing power is likely to
wane.]{.underline} Big retailers, such as Walmart and Target, recently
exhibited such dynamics when they showed shrinking margins. [That said,
moderating inflation is not the same as vanquishing
inflation]{.underline}. Realistically, inflation, while declining, will
stay above the target rate of 2% through all of next year and plausibly
beyond --- and upside risks remain. [There could be new, unexpected
shocks]{.underline}.

### AT: recession risk now 

#### Recession risks limited -- trending in the right direction 

**Carlsson-Szlezak , 2022**

[As the chance of recession comes down to the balance of moderating
inflation vs. a slowing economy, we should also ask how much stress the
economy can absorb. If a 2023 recession is avoided, it will be because
U.S. consumers and firms are still in robust health]{.underline}.
Household balance sheets are strong, and the labor market is booming.
Encouragingly, [we see some cooling of inflation pressures]{.underline}
(such as falling durable goods prices and easing wage growth) [without
macroeconomic weakness.]{.underline} And though firms' margins will
decline from here, they're coming down from exceedingly strong levels.
[Yet, it's easy to point to the economy's vulnerabilities.]{.underline}
Deteriorating business sentiment can weigh on investment rapidly,
robbing the economy of momentum. And despite the strong labor market and
strong household balance sheets, [consumer confidence has been depressed
for a while]{.underline}, likely driven by energy prices. [Add to that
the fact that wobbly financial markets shrink household
wealth]{.underline} --- a problem that would get bigger if the housing
market were to turn --- [and the cycle looks vulnerable]{.underline}.
[That said, if a recession hits in 2023, there are good reasons to
expect it to be mild because the drivers of the most damaging types of
recession are less likely today]{.underline}. Banks are well
capitalized, profitable, and unlikely to drive a structural overhang in
recession. This leaves the prospect that [demand could return quickly
and that labor markets remain tight]{.underline}, which [would keep a
recession mild.]{.underline}

### Internal link - NATO Key to Supply Chains

#### NATO is central to the protection of global supply chains

[NATO plays an active role in]{.underline} global peacekeeping, has
built up the concept of co-operative security, and is a deterrent for
illegal and terrorist activities. And it is in this role that we see the
link between its activities and its importance to [global supply
chains.]{.underline} Protecting the Supply Chain [Current events such as
the war in Ukraine and global COVID restrictions]{.underline}, as well
as the ongoing threat of terrorist activity has [highlighted the
importance of stability and continuity in the supply chain.]{.underline}
For example, while Ukraine may not be a member of NATO, the [NATO
countries are using integrated logistics and supply routes to move arms,
vehicles and aid into the war zone.]{.underline} Through its actions in
the past, as well as actions it is taking now and for the future, [NATO
is providing support and protection for global supply
chains.]{.underline} Here are three key ways that demonstrate the
importance of the organisation to the global community: 1. Protection of
Key Infrastructure -- Energy Security [Energy and key utilities, such as
oil and gas, are critical for almost every aspect of global supply
chains. Disruption]{.underline} to sources or supplies of energy [could
easily undermine the security of countries and continents, leading to
situations where global production is halted, and supply of
everything]{.underline} from electronic components to food and drink [is
disrupted.]{.underline} [Vulnerabilities exist not only in
infrastructure]{.underline} (oil/gas pipelines; power stations), [but
also in the systems used to control and manage them, especially in light
of the increasing threat of cyber attacks.]{.underline} NATO members
have been working since 2008 on energy security programs to help protect
key infrastructure and ensure continuity of supply for both nations and
the military. 2. Counter Piracy Operations and Protection of Sea Lanes
Piracy continues to be a major threat to supply chains and freight in
key shipping lanes around the world. While it would seem that the threat
of piracy has lessened due to fewer serious incidents reported in the
press in recent years, it remains a problem for shipping companies. NATO
has in the past assisted in operations such as Operation Shield, an
international cooperation to combat piracy of the east coast of Africa.
Though this operation has since ended, NATO continues to work with
countries and global partners to assist further anti-piracy efforts.
[Without the protection that NATO affords]{.underline} in conjunction
with national navies and governments, [there is the potential for
disruptions]{.underline} to ships and cargo [that would have lasting
impacts on global supply chains.]{.underline} 3. Crisis Management
including Relief Supplies in event of Natural Disasters NATO plays a key
role in crisis and disaster management, both within its member countries
and outside of this region. For this, [NATO actually forms part of the
global supply chain, ensuring that aid, equipment and personnel are able
to reach areas]{.underline} affected by natural disasters. This can take
the form of physically shipping goods on behalf of its member nations,
as well as ensuring that requests for assistance from members or other
countries are conveyed to the correct areas of government. [While we may
not see the work that NATO does as part of, or to support, global supply
chains, its importance cannot be overemphasised. Without its efforts
since its inception over 70 years ago, the global supply chain would
look very different to how it does now.]{.underline}

was among thousands of companies that shut systems down to assess the
data damage.]{.underline} The Copenhagen-based container carrier's
estimate of the cost was around \$300 million. Back then, port operators
were among those with the most tangible consequences. While goods were
moved, the process was slowed as terminals reverted to manual or backup
operations. Still, [the global economy absorbed the shock without much
wider damage. With supply chains stretched to their limits, that's
unlikely to be the case now.]{.underline} No Buffer "In 2017 we could
essentially lose the largest carrier in the world for a week and it
didn't cause any major problems," Jensen said. "Sure, if you had your
cargo on board one of those ships it got delayed maybe a week or two and
that was annoying, but from a global perspective it was a non-event in
terms of disturbing the supply chain. [There was plenty of buffer
capacity --- of ships, terminals, everything. Right now we have zero, as
in literally zero, buffer capacity."]{.underline} Four of the world's
top five container lines are headquartered in western and northern
Europe, and at least one has been hit with a cyber attack since the
start of the pandemic. Marseille, France-based CMA CGM said in September
2020 that a breach hit services and affected bookings. Days later, the
International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency that serves
as the industry's regulatory body, said it suffered "a sophisticated
cyber attack" affecting its public website and internal systems. [In
mid-January, European Union governments took part in large-scale
simulation of a cyber intrusion affecting multiple member countries. The
six-week exercise was expected to model attacks on supply chains and
some spillover socio-economic effects in other countries.]{.underline}
"If they have done their jobs well, they have a good backup plan,"
Jensen said. ["In the current environment, taking just one major port
out of action for two, three, four days on top of what we're already
dealing with --- that will have major ramifications on the supply
chain."]{.underline}

[In economic terms, growth is down and inflation is up. In human terms,
people's incomes are down and hardship is up]{.underline} . [These
double crises---pandemic and war]{.underline}---and our ability to deal
with them, [are further complicated]{.underline} by another growing
risk: [fragmentation of the world economy into geopolitical
blocs]{.underline}---with different trade and technology standards,
payment systems, and reserve currencies. Such a tectonic shift would
incur painful adjustment costs. Supply chains, R&D, and production
networks would be broken and need to be rebuilt. [Poor countries and
poor people will bear the brunt of these dislocations. This
fragmentation of global governance is perhaps the most serious challenge
to the rules-based framework that has governed international and
economic relations for more than 75 years]{.underline}, and helped

It is already impairing our capacity to work together on the two crises

community. The actions we take now, together, will determine our future
in fundamental ways. It reminds me of Bretton Woods in 1944 when, in the
dark shadow of war, leaders came together to envision a brighter world.
It was a moment of unprecedented courage and cooperation. We need that

THE UNITED STATES ASPECT

Being the influential and dominant member, the United States did not
consider NATO or cybersecurity to be of great importance, however, the
dynamics are likely to change post- 2020 Presidential elections. Joe
Biden, the President-elect, declared cyber threats as "one of the
defining challenges of our time." He believes that in today's time,
Russia and China impose a threat to NATO's security by continuously
attacking the Alliance and its members. [To equip with protection from
the aforementioned threats, Biden under the US believes that NATO has to
adopt a policy of constructive, ongoing responses to China and Russia in
cyberspace to achieve its mission of deterrence and security, where
great power rivalry is taking place in real-time. NATO's central focus
should be on cybersecurity, for which the following three key actions
are to be followed.]{.underline}

First, [NATO should mandate that resilient cybersecurity architectures,
the powers of its members and its main essential infrastructures be
built and enforced by itself]{.underline}. Primary elements of a robust
infrastructure could include the use of cloud technologies in the
private sector; zero confidence architecture for successful access
management; creation of stable hardware capabilities; and cyber defences
increased by deep learning and artificial intelligence. [To achieve
this, the architecture framework suggested needs to be flexible to adapt
to the rapidly developing and emerging technologies. However, the
barrier arises as it is a challenge for NATO to itself build the
suggested architecture. Using the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP),
procurement processes, requirements and goals, and Allied Command
Transition strategy to promote a robust research and development
initiative, it should stress their necessity and require its members to
do so.]{.underline}

[NATO must agree that one size would not fit all when determining
specifications for these resilient architectures.]{.underline} Not only
will requirements differ among military, government, and critical
infrastructures operators, but, as has been shown in the development of
autonomous vehicles and space capabilities, [there are a variety of
different approaches that may prove effective]{.underline}.10

Second, **[NATO should conduct active cybersecurity in cooperation with
its nations]{.underline}**. Due to technological loopholes or human
error, [even the best exclusionary technologies in a cybersecurity
resilient design may fail.]{.underline} As a result, [even after an
attacker has abused cybersecurity, the alliance requires \"active cyber
defences\'\' that will create durability]{.underline}. These features
impact only certain networks where they have been built by providers and
owners and are not for offensive purposes. [In its Active Cyber
Defence11, the US National Security Agency illustrates how the key
elements of active defence capacities include "real-time communication,
sense-making analytics to understand the current state and automated
decision-making to decide how to react to current state
information.']{.underline}'\[10\]

[NATO must be capable of searching for potential enemies within
electronic networks vital to security as a core aspect of successful
cyber defence]{.underline}. By removing malware and closing redundant
**ports[, the Alliance could build highly competent specialist hunting
teams to review device operations, identify irregularities, and combat
intruders]{.underline}**[. NATO Standing Cybersecurity Hunt Teams should
also be working with the cooperation and active collaboration of
national governments and operators of infrastructure
networks]{.underline}. [These hunting teams will perform in- depth
technological assessments of live networks to detect unnoticed risks,
according to the US Department of Homeland Security. Standing
Cybersecurity Hunt Teams will broaden the capacities of NATO\'s existing
Cyber Rapid Response teams, which are small in size and work reactively,
with an emphasis on aggressive protection]{.underline}.

Third[, NATO should strategize a sustained intervention policy aimed at
reducing Russian and Chinese interventions to undercut the cyberspace
alliance]{.underline}. [US Cyber Command developed the idea of sustained
commitment, but the reasoning still extends to NATO, arising from the
need to tackle the current cyber attack campaigns emanating from Russia
and China.]{.underline} [Persistent engagement includes monitoring
enemies, recognising their objectives, evaluating the instruments used
for attacks, and taking steps to degrade their ability to blunt current
attacks or stop potential attacks. As a core aspect of its deterrence
and security, the Alliance wants a sustained commitment cyber
policy]{.underline}.

[NATO should exploit its intelligence and defence preparation resources
to build a framework for allies to actively control cyberattacks from
Russia and China to ensure sustained participation successfully in the
Alliance]{.underline}. [NATO can collect information]{.underline}
through its Intelligence and Security Branch, attacking allied vital
assets, strategic capabilities, or democratic structures. [Using
this]{.underline} material, the Cyberspace Operations Center ([CYOC) of
NATO could outline ways to decrease the capacity of Russia and China to
carry out such attacks.]{.underline} [The CYOC should share its analyses
with pre-designated Allies who would work with targeted countries and
employ their cyber effects against the identified
threats12]{.underline}. In support of NATO operations, nine NATO nations
have already pledged to make those results possible. [The aforementioned
cyber-capable allies will be responsible, based on NATO guidelines, for
persistently undermining the cyber operations of
adversaries]{.underline}. [This model will make the CYOC of NATO a
strategy platform with an approach to persistent interaction around the
Alliance. It will allow NATO to encourage its members to take individual
or multilateral measures against hybrid cyberspace operations by
adversaries.]{.underline}

### NATO comprehensive policy -- solvency 

#### Revised policies for NATO collective cyber defense and offense under Article 5 necessary - multifaceted unified policy solves 

. NATO must plan to protect the infrastructure and key resources of
member states as a unified effort, not a piecemeal operation undertaken
by a few nations. In order to do this, NATO must identify and prioritise
infrastructure for protection, as well as criteria and policy for action

[With the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24,
2022[, US and Western European pundits predicted devastating and
crippling cyber effects predicating kinetic warfare]{.underline}.
However, over the past weeks[, numerous Russian actions in cyberspace
have largely flown beneath the radar due to actions by the
cyber-security industry, or so-called "patriotic hackers", who have
taken it upon themselves to counter Russian cyber aggression and attack
Russian cyber infrastructure]{.underline}. In light of developments such
as these, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ([NATO) should consider
and create policy for collective cyber defence, and potentially offense,
under Article 5 of the NATO Charter]{.underline}.

Cyberspace has proliferated across the globe, particularly in critical
infrastructure, as technology has eclipsed traditional definitions of
computing. Non-traditional computers reside in pockets, are able to make
phone calls, and, increasingly, take high-resolution photographs. These
non-traditional computers also maintain proper food temperatures in
kitchens, give directions in cars, and track movement and health on
people's wrists. But more importantly, these [non-traditional computers
reside in critical infrastructure centres displaying data for
operators]{.underline} in the form of large screen monitors on walls,
showing the physical environment through closed circuit television
cameras. [Many of these devices, which frequently lack anti-virus
protection and utilise vulnerable protocols, exist within critical
infrastructure, either natively or brought into these environments by
employees]{.underline}. [Electrical power generation and distribution,
telecommunications, finance, and water treatment and distribution are
some examples of critical infrastructure that are managed by
computer-controlled systems]{.underline}. Compounding the problem, [the
internet does not abide by national boundaries, making forensic
investigation and attribution]{.underline} [difficult]{.underline}.
Critical infrastructure sectors rely heavily on automation, and thus
online control, as described in the U.S. National Strategy for Maritime
Cybersecurity.

[Recent state activities demonstrate how cyberoperations can have
physical consequences.]{.underline} In the summer of 2020, Iranian
hacking of Israeli water treatment facilities came close to
over-chloritizing the water, changing faucets into poison dispensers.
More recently, in February 2022, in an attempt to cut communications
within Ukraine, Russian cyberattacks on Viasat satellite networks
disrupted German windmill electricity generation and distribution.
Additionally, [Russia]{.underline} has in the past---and
[continues]{.underline} in the current war as recently as April
2022---[to target electrical power generation and distribution
systems]{.underline} with cyber effects and to harm Ukrainian civilian
and military infrastructure. As the above examples show[, cyber attacks
are not limited to online locations but their impact can be felt in the
physical world]{.underline}. As a result, NATO must prepare for these
activities to grow and expand.

Following the shortcomings of the 2015 United Nations Group of
Governmental Experts report on information and telecommunications in the
context of national security, [a lack of consensus continues to exist on
the severity of cyberspace operations targeting critical infrastructure
requiring collective and even national responses]{.underline}.
Individual nations constructed individual criteria and response actions,
utilising diplomacy, information, military, or economic action. They
largely did so alone or in combination with other states[.
NATO,]{.underline} however, did not formulate a coherent analogous
response and as a result[, lacks publicly acknowledged policy addressing
cyberspace activities that would constitute a necessary collective
response under Article]{.underline} 5. In order for [NATO]{.underline}
to maintain its relevance in the present moment and sustain it through
the coming years, this [paradigm must change.]{.underline}

NATO must [adjust]{.underline} its [thinking regarding methods of
warfare as cyberspace operations---both destructive attacks and
disinformation---continue to grow in complexity and in certain areas
even replace traditional kinetic operations.]{.underline} To fulfill
this role in kinetic as well as non-kinetic realms, [NATO must be
prepared for hybrid forms of warfare and present slated to join the
alliance a cohesive and tailored response to
transgressions]{.underline}. [This is increasingly important as Russia
continues to threaten potential future NATO members such as Finland and
Sweden, who are slated to join the alliance in the coming
months]{.underline}. Russia has overtly stated that the invasion of
Ukraine was, in part, a response to NATO's eastward expansion. Although
Russia has deemed NATO expansion into former Soviet states to be
problematic since the collapse of the USSR, recently, [Moscow has also
begun to denounce potential expansion beyond its perceived immediate
sphere of influence]{.underline}. For example, on April 14, 2022,
Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov cautioned that the
inclusion of Finland and Sweden into the military alliance would have
dire consequences, including Russia reinforcing nuclear weapons in the
Baltic Sea region.

[Considering the increased emphasis and relevance of the transatlantic
alliance leading up to and during Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it is
imperative for the organisation's member states to identify and agree
upon more pronounced "triggers" or "red lines" that determine what
constitutes a sufficiently egregious action in cyberspace for Article 5
to be discussed, and if need be, potentially invoked]{.underline}.
Furthermore, in enhancing its preparedness in cyberspace[, specific
policies must be crafted that delineate synchronised actions taken
collectively by members to prevent Russian malign activities in the
cyber domain under Article 5 to allow for a rapid and coordinated
response]{.underline}. The dominance of the US, the UK, Australia,
Canada, and New Zealand, known in government as the FVEY, or Five-Eyes,
highlights the urgent need for the alliance to develop policy addressing
the collective defence of NATO members. [Effective policy for NATO
should address collective and coordinated cyberspace operations, both
offensive and defensive.]{.underline} Currently, NATO, as a military
institution, lacks "rules of engagement" for cyberspace and individual
member states lack a standardised threshold or response guidance.
Therefore, NATO must define the activities, "red lines", and threshold
incurring response, as well as what a coordinated kinetic/cyber response
would entail. The interconnectedness of European critical
infrastructure, as illuminated by the Russian ViaSat communications
attack impacting German wind power generation and distribution,
highlights the requirement for NATO to address cyberspace as the
critical domain it is. As a result, [we recommend]{.underline}:

[In the event of adversarial cyberspace actions warranting Article 5
action, the NATO Commander becomes the commander and coordinator for all
cyberspace activities, both defensive and offensive, by NATO nations
within the area of hostilities.]{.underline}

[NATO identifies, establishes, prioritises, and continually refines
critical infrastructure and key resources within member
nations,]{.underline} as well as criteria for what constitutes necessary
action for collective responses.

[NATO identifies limits of activity, or "red lines" resulting in Article
5]{.underline} [response discussions.]{.underline}

[NATO members present the NATO Commander intelligence identifying
indications, warnings, and attribution of cyberspace attacks, both for
response action and, where applicable, public consumption.]{.underline}

[NATO members present legal constraints and capabilities]{.underline} of
nations [to the NATO commander allowing maximisation of nations'
capacity and capability.]{.underline}

[NATO must recognise cyberspace for what it is]{.underline}---[an
interlocutor of networks and devices]{.underline} from control systems
for critical infrastructure to seemingly anonymous devices operating in
the background of our lives. [This interconnectedness by an invisible
thread of information, however, is the critical vulnerability in the
stability of societies]{.underline}. [NATO must plan to protect the
infrastructure and key resources of member states as a unified effort,
not a piecemeal operation undertaken by a few nations.]{.underline} In
order to do this, [NATO must identify and prioritise infrastructure for
protection, as well as criteria and policy for action]{.underline}.
[Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine and the Kremlin's increased
aggression]{.underline}, not solely in kinetic but also in non-kinetic
realms, is a stark reminder that the [alternative to further delay of
the inevitable recognition of cyberspace for what it is will,
ultimately, prove to be all the more costly.]{.underline}

[What happens when an alliance's competitors quickly improve their

addressed this dilemma during a recent summit in Brussels.  At the
summit, [the North Atlantic Council built upon[ NATO's 2030 strategic
outline](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/12/pdf/201201-Reflection-Group-Final-Report-Uni.pdf) and
presented targets for increased technological collaboration to counter
growing threats from Russia, China, and non-state actors. While NATO's
scientific and technical superiority has historically allowed it to
outpace competitors, its adversaries are quickly closing the
gap.]{.underline}

[NATO members still hold advantages in their development of [new
technologies](http://wavellroom.com/podcast/technology-and-the-future-of-land-warfare/)]{.underline}.
According to the Global Innovation Index, seven of the top ten[ most
innovative
countries](https://knowledge.insead.edu/entrepreneurship/the-worlds-most-innovative-countries-2020-15076) globally
are part of NATO, while the other three are key NATO partners. [Even so,
NATO can do more to harness the alliance's combined technological
prowess to better compete and win in a future conflict. As China seeks
to become the[ world's innovation
leader](https://www.businesschief.asia/leadership-and-strategy/china-aims-be-global-innovation-leaders-next-15-years) and
Russia continues to undermine the alliance's security, NATO will need to
out-innovate its competitors and prepare for an uncertain
future.]{.underline}

[Four areas where NATO can focus on improving its competitive edge are
developing its formal organizations, increasing public and private
sector collaboration, harnessing and countering Emerging Disruptive
Technologies (EDTs),]{.underline} and improving conventional military
equipment. [NATO must maintain its relative lead in technology sectors
to defend its people and enhance its long-term strategic position.
Improving science and technology (S&T) innovation will increase alliance
collaboration, strengthen public and private sector cooperation, counter
hybrid threats, deter adversaries, and harden defenses against
attacks]{.underline}. [NATO's effectiveness in the future will heavily
depend on its ability to maintain and improve its science and technology
capabilities.]{.underline}

A [significant strategic concern for NATO]{.underline} allies [is to

pursuit of]{.underline} [e]{.underline}merging, [d]{.underline}isruptive
[t]{.underline}echnologie[s]{.underline} [and their authoritarian models
of governance present significant risks to NATO allies]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} models, [coupled with Russia and China's shared
willingness to undermine national and international institutions in the
trans-Atlantic community]{.underline}, [mean that the most daunting
threat NATO faces may be to its foundational values.]{.underline}
Incorporating these core values into strategy and policy will be a key
task for the 2022 Strategic Concept.

New Domains

Whether in coordination or not, [China and Russia will undoubtedly
continue to challenge allies in domains like space and cyber
using]{.underline} emerging and emerged [technologies]{.underline}.
[Dealing with such challenges is core NATO business]{.underline} ---
grounded in Article 3 of the Washington Treaty and resting primarily
with national authorities. The new Strategic Concept should aim to
integrate these relatively new domains while responding to disruptive
technologies as well. [Allies must endeavor to reach a]{.underline}
"[pre-crisis]{.underline}" [consensus on what space and cyber actions
would constitute an]{.underline} "[armed attack]{.underline}" [in
accordance with Article 5]{.underline}. [This kind of crisis
decision-making is a core function of NATO's political and military
headquarters]{.underline}. [Such agreement]{.underline}, when [paired
with improved national capabilities]{.underline}, [would contribute to
deterrence]{.underline} by communicating resolve to adversaries.
[Improved capabilities]{.underline} themselves [will only arise through
public-private partnership to maintain a technological
edge]{.underline}. [A common strategic culture of
innovation]{.underline}, much of which arises from the private sector,
[is a key advantage that NATO]{.underline} [has]{.underline} --- [and

## Cyber defenders 

#### NATO cyber defenders increase cyber defense -- new partnerships and tech key 

**Ackerman 20**

Director, SIGNAL Media; former war correspondent at AFCEA International,

Cybersecurity Activities" Signal Magazine, May 2020, Proquest, accessed

[From partnerships with industry to dual-use Al cyber capabilities, the
alliance is playing the field]{.underline}. [NATO is doubling down on
cyberspace defense with increased partnerships and new technology
thrusts.]{.underline} Information exchanges on threats and solutions,
coupled with research into exotic capabilities such as artificial
intelligence, are part of alliance efforts to secure its own networks
and aid allies in the cybersecurity fight[. The threats the alliance
networks face constitute relatively the same ones confronting other
organizations. NATO faces the double challenge of securing its own
networks and information assets, as well as helping its member nations
improve their own national cyber resilience. In the past, NATO viewed
cybersecurity as somewhat of a technical challenge. But that perspective
evolved over time as the cyberscape underwent changes]{.underline}. This
came less from choice and more of necessity as a result of the amount
and content of malicious cyber activity, explains Christian Liflander,
head of section, Cyber Defense, Emerging Challenges Division, NATO.
[NATO does not have any tanks, ships or aircraft, with a few exceptions
such as the AWACS aircraft operated from Geilenkirchen Air Base in
Germany. However, when it comes to cyber defense, NATO has its own
capability that defends its networks and maintains their operation in
the face of adversarial actions. Unlike combat forces, cyber defenders
are all NATO staff members. This force is not dependent on individuals
loaned from member nations. Instead, it staffs its own personnel to form
a core of cybersecurity expertise. One constant over the next few years
will be the need to remain resilient]{.underline}, Liflander states.
[NATO networks must be built and operated in ways that deny benefits to
cyber attackers. This includes NATO being able to run networks in a
degraded environment. Yet this is easier said than done, he offers.
While NATO will continuously work to improve its cyber defense, its
adversaries also will become more sophisticated and capable. \"The
changing threat landscape will continue to challenge us,\" Liflander
says. \"I don\'t really think there will be an endpoint where we can
declare mission accomplished,\" he states. \"It is a continuous task, a
continuous mission, making sure that networks are well-defended.\" The
alliance is looking to manage risk differently, he offers. \"It\'s not
only a technical risk that we\'re looking at; it\'s a risk to a
mission.\" The alliance must be certain that an operational commander is
able to operate in cyberspace with the same freedom of maneuver
available on land, at sea and in the air. National cybersecurity
resilience also presents the dichotomy of continuity and
chang]{.underline}e. Member nations often face threats to their critical
infrastructure or other soft elements in addition to hardened government
networks. [Attackers can be nation-states, organized criminals,
individual hacktivists or even those working as proxies, although the
vast majority of attacks are nonstate activities such as ransomware.
\"NATO\'s role in helping allies improve national resilience will become
even more critical,\" Liflander offers. And NATO is no different in
terms of potential threats to its networks. The alliance is looking at
issues such as military supply chains, training and education,
situational awareness and resourcing cyber defense. But Liflander
emphasizes that NATO does not want to fall into the trap of viewing
cybersecurity as simply a technology issue. This brings into play
training and cyber hygiene, he notes. Neither the alliance nor its
member nations have unlimited resources for cyber defense, so they must
ensure that their resources are applied effectively]{.underline},
Liflander notes. [NATO will serve as an important facilitator for allies
as they develop their national cyber capabilities. \"It starts with
resources]{.underline}. If you\'re not spending resources, you\'re not
going to improve,\" he declares. Liflander offers that NATO is one of
the most sophisticated cyber actors among international organizations,
and that comes from both its mandate and its partnered approach. \"We
have quite understood that no one, however powerful, can go it alone,\"
he declares. \"You need to cooperate. That\'s a prerequisite in order to
do your job well.\"

WHY CULTIVATING TRUE COOPERATION IS KEY

Criminal, non-state sponsored, activity withstanding, why would the PRC
choose to violate an explicit bargain in the face of a credible threat
of retaliation? Assuming a rational actor, it would be simply because
the prospective marginal gains still outweigh the prospective mar- ginal
costs[. Though explicit bargains set the conditions for avoiding
escalatory spirals, there must exist a viable and mutually beneficial
solution which is attainable through the prospect of cooperation.
Otherwise, both sides would be resigned to a future of escalatory
standoffs or cost- ly competition.]{.underline} Notably, this is where
the dynamics of counter-intelligence and norm develop- ment diverge.
Namely, [espionage and counterintelligence have no other prospective
solutions outside of tacit bargaining,]{.underline} absent the
possibility of an intelligence-sharing treaty like the Unit- ed Kingdom
-- United States of America Agreement (UKUSA), also known as the "Five
Eyes." [Without such agreements, practitioners typically accept costly
competition and retrospectively define the boundaries of acceptable
action by triggering escalatory standoffs]{.underline}. Whether the So-
larWinds hack is such a trigger or just becomes another aspect of costly
competition remains to be seen. Either way, on norm development, it may
be easier to build cooperation on economic issues as the market may have
already provided the prospect for such regarding IP-theft.

In his seminal work, The Evolution of Cooperation, Robert Axelrod notes
that the prospect of continued engagement enables cooperation to
develop; inversely, a perception that the PRC or US would soon collapse
undermines motivation for either party to cooperate. Instead, each would
simply exploit the other for as much as it can steal from the other
before the game ends. [Assuming neither party is on the verge of
collapse, in an environment in which continuous engagement is to be
expected, for a strategy to be collectively stable---that is, able to
resist the invasion of competing strategies---the strategy must offer a
higher rate of return than a compet- ing strategy.]{.underline} In other
words[, an international normative behavior must essentially be
self-rein- forcing.]{.underline} This requires two sequential
conditions:

1\) [The reciprocal benefits of IP protections must be more beneficial
amongst cooperating parties]{.underline}, e.g. the like-minded nations
in the G-20, than for them to participate in IP-theft against each other

2\) [For (1) to be true, those who protect and respect IP must be
prepared to retaliate collec- tively against those that adopt IP-theft,
to deny, reduce, or otherwise render prohibitively costly the stolen
IP]{.underline}.\[61\]

In essence, [retaliation for violations of an international norm should
be multilateral]{.underline}. [Not only would a multilateral effort
relieve the US of solely bearing the costs of enforcement, multilat-
eral condemnation of IP-theft would provide even greater legitimacy to
any punitive actions inside or outside cyberspace, raising the
credibility and scope of potential punishment for violations while
constraining the PRC's freedom of action to retaliate in
kind.]{.underline}

While effective retaliation may deter future transgressions, the ability
to return to a mutually cooperative state is as important.\[62\]
[Pundits may argue that communicating on such intentions is impossible
due to issues of trust, but the economic market for justice may well
have already provided the tacit evidence necessary to move nations and
other entities towards a cooperative cyberspace and away from
IP-theft]{.underline}. As Fareed Zakaria put it,

That China engages in rampant theft of intellectual property is a widely
accepted fact---ex- cept among U.S. companies doing business in China.
In a recent survey of such compa- nies conducted by the U.S.-China
Business Council, intellectual property protection ranked sixth on a
list of pressing concerns, down from number two in 2014. ...Why this
shift from 2014? That year, China created its first specialized courts
to handle intellectual proper- ty cases. In 2015, foreign plaintiffs
brought 63 cases in the Beijing Intellectual Property Court. The court
ruled for the foreign firms in all 63.\[63\]

Since then, the IP caseload has grown rapidly. "In 2018 alone, Chinese
courts received 301,278 new IP cases in the first instance, of which
287,795 were concluded. These figures represent an increase of 41
percent and 42 percent respectively compared to those for 2017."\[64\]
These include cases involving myriad American, Chinese, and other
international companies.\[65\] Interestingly, \~79% of the cases brought
before the court were purely PRC domestic cases,\[66\] with the
remainder having foreign interests represented. In those latter cases,
the court ruled in civil cases \~68% of the time in favor of foreign
interests over domestic parties.\[67\]

Historical evidence points towards potential cooperation on intellectual
property rights as well. As Yukon Huang and Jeremy Smith from the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace argue,

In terms of outright theft of IP, China's infractions are anything but
unique: It is just one of 36 violators listed in the 2019 Special 301
Report by the Office of the U.S. Trade Repre- sentative (USTR).
Historically, rapidly growing emerging market economies tend to be cited
as they transition to higher income levels. For example, decades ago
Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan were each perennial Section 301 violators
until they reached a per capita GDP of about \$20,000-\$25,000.\[68\]

Given the PRC's per capita GDP is roughly \$17,000 as of 2020,\[69\]
this hypothesis will likely be tested in the near future.

Others are less optimistic about China's IP-theft, noting that the US
Trade Representative cites numerous cases and complaints in the office's
2018 report on PRC IP-theft.\[70\] And Za- karia does not consider that
many affected US businesses may be unaware that they were victims of
such theft.\[71\] However, Zakaria does highlight the convergence of PRC
interests, US pressure, and desired normative behavior by stating that,

reforms...are often undertaken only in the face of Western pressure and,
even then, be- cause they serve China's own competitive interests---the
largest filer of patents worldwide last year was the Chinese
telecommunications giant Huawei. But it is also true that many Chinese
economists and senior policymakers have argued that the country will
modernize and grow its economy only if it pursues further reform.\[72\]

[While it may not be immediate, there certainly appears to be a prospect
of cooperation that benefits both parties as the marginal gains from
reciprocal IP protection outweigh the marginal gains from IP-theft as
China's economy matures]{.underline}.

Some claim that this was a fait accompli, that the Chinese economy was
essentially able to mature because of the IP-theft over these past
decades. This is perhaps true and it may have been a strategic failure
of the US for not timely countering. [However, it was not a failure of
the US to envision an operational approach to cyberspace; tacit bargains
without explicit bargains are unlikely to have been helpful; and tacit
bargains in support of the explicit bargain, though some may have been
potentially successful, would still run the risk of an escalatory spiral
absent a perceived prospect of cooperation.]{.underline} Additionally,
[a multilateral effort to collaborate on punishing IP-theft and
protecting the value of cybersecurity cooperation is still
lacking]{.underline}. How to resolve the issues of retribution for past
transgressions is beyond the scope of this article, which seeks to
highlight the dynamics at play and explain why explicit bargains, the
prospect of cooperation, and multilateral coordination outside of the
cyberspace domain are important keys to developing international norms
within cyberspace.

#### International entanglement and norm setting offers effective deterrent for malicious cyber activity- Estonia policy approach proves

**Parnik 22**

of Excellence (CCDCOE), "Cyber deterrence: A case study on Estonia's
policies and practice," The European Centre of Excellence for Countering
Hybrid Threats, October 2021,

[Participating in international cooperation (and in doing so, ensuring
Estonia's leading position in international cybersecurity issues) is
expected to strengthen deterrence through entanglement and norm-setting.
The interdependence and entanglement of cyberspace actors can have
deterrent effect]{.underline}s.[26 When many countries abide
by]{.underline} "the rules of the road" [-- international law, cyber
norms and confidence-building measures -- and act responsibly in
cyberspace, it creates trust and stability. Countries are interdependent
in cyberspace]{.underline}. For example, if one country were to target a
public core of the internet (such as terrestrial and undersea cables,
internet exchange points, and domain name system), such an attack would
also impose serious costs on the attacker. In this case,
[interdependencies in cyberspace are likely to contribute to cyber
deterrence because a potential attacker has something valuable to
lose]{.underline}. For countries whose economic growth and political
regime are highly dependent upon the internet, the prevailing interest
is to ensure the stability of cyberspace.27 [International cooperation
on cybersecurity increases entanglement. Similarly to entanglement,
norms "can deter actions by imposing reputational costs that can damage
an actor's soft power beyond the value gained from a given
attack".]{.underline}28 The [multilateralization of cyber norms helps to
raise the reputational costs of irresponsible state behaviour in
cyberspace.]{.underline}29 As a small country[,]{.underline} Estonia
stresses the importance of upholding value- and rule-based international
order, including democratic freedoms and human rights in cyberspace,
which support Estonian security policy objectives. [Small countries in
particular benefit from the existence of international rule-based order,
and from the extension of the rule of law to cyberspace]{.underline}.30
Estonia's objective is therefore to establish that international law
applies to cyberspace, and states must adhere to global cyber norms. It
[sees international cooperation and cyber diplomacy as being fundamental
to domestic defence and resilience.]{.underline}31 In the country's
view, [when states violate norms, they must be held responsible for
these actions through collective public attribution and the imposition
of response measures. Legal consequences must be imposed upon cyber norm
violators.]{.underline}32 Through international cooperation and cyber
diplomacy efforts, [states will understand that they are interdependent
and that cyberspace stability benefits everyone.]{.underline} Hence,
responsible state behaviour is in everyone's interests, which
contributes to deterrence by entanglement. [An example of entanglement
comprises Estonia's efforts since 2007 to put cybersecurity on the
agenda of international and regional organization]{.underline}s (the EU,
NATO, UN, OSCE, the Council of Europe, and Baltic and Nordic
inter-governmental and parliamentary cooperation formats) on a regular
basis. Likewise, [Estonia has contributed over many years to the
cybersecurity capacity-building of many EU and NATO partners and beyond,
believing that this assistance contributes to international stability in
cyberspace, and consequently deters malicious cyberattacks.]{.underline}
Estonia stresses that sharing cybersecurity information and best
practices increases mutual trust and stability in cyberspace,
strengthening deterrence and defence.33 For Estonia, multi- and
bilateral international cooperation is a primary means of achieving
entanglement and norms-related objectives through whole-of-society and
multi-stakeholder approaches. [Publishing the government's positions on
how international law applies to cyberspace is aimed at influencing
other states to adhere to responsible state behaviour in
cyberspace]{.underline}.34 To strengthen its cyber diplomacy capacity,
Estonia established a position in 2018 for an ambassador-at-large for
cybersecurity. Estonia is one of the leaders among the Baltic and Nordic
countries when it comes to cyber diplomacy. It has been a member of the
UN Group of Governmental Experts for many years, and is also a leader in
cyber diplomacy education for foreign diplomats.35 As a member of the UN
Security Council in 2020-- 2021, in June 2021 Estonia organized for the
first time in the Council's history an open meeting on cybersecurity,
where it raised the issue of state behaviour in cyberspace in the
context of international peace and security.36 Since 2008, Estonia has
hosted the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE),
which sponsors the publication of world-renowned scholarly works on
international law applicable to cyberspace -- the Tallinn Manuals 1.0
(2013), 2.0 (2017), and the forthcoming volume 3.0.37

#### [Internal link solvency]{.underline} -- ICT allows cyberattacks on CBRN facilities -- only cooperation and harmonisation at a regional level like the plan solves

**Farnelli**, PhD and Senior researcher in international law at
University of Bologna, **2022**

(Gian Maria, "Chapter 31: New Technologies and CBRN Events:
International Obligations in the Cybersecurity Domain," [International
Law and Chemical, Biological, Radio-Nuclear (CBRN) Events: Towards an
All-Hazards Approach]{.underline}, it's a book, edited by de Guttry et
al., 2022, Koninklijke Brill NV, accessed 7/1/2022, gdi-tmur)

\*ICT = Information and communication technology

\*CBRN = Chemical, Biological, Radio-Nuclear

Building upon the consideration that '\[[t\]he expanding use of ICTs in
critical infrastructures and industrial control systems creates new
possibilities for disruption']{.underline},86 the chapter at hand has
presented the reasons why cybersecurity has been at the forefront of
policymakers' minds since the early 21st Century. States and
international bodies have increasingly addressed the issue at hand, with
a view to preventing malicious uses of ICT inconsistent with the
collective interest in the maintenance of international peace and
security.

The present analysis has also addressed the ongoing debate over the
application of international obligations to activities in cyberspace.
[It is commonly accepted that existing international law applies in
cyberspace without the need to develop a new legal
instrument]{.underline}. [However, technical difficulties in attributing
conduct in cyberspace make the application of secondary rules on State
responsibility difficult, leaving space for 'malicious cyber operations
without an author']{.underline}.

Against this background, applying existing international due diligence
obligations to ICT over which a State exercises jurisdiction appears
reasonable. This would arguably mitigate the risk and the effect of
malicious cyber activities targeting critical infrastructure, and
provide the territorial State with legitimate reasons to exercise
proportionate monitoring activities on data flows. Moreover, such
approach would provide the victim State with a liable party from whom to
seek compensation, absent a clear attribution of the cyber operation.

It has been argued that [the application of existing obligations of due
diligence,]{.underline} eg those stemming from the customary no harm
rule, to highly ICT-dependent CBRN facilities [requires]{.underline}
[the territorial State to exercise control over the appropriateness of
the cybersecurity standards of any CBRN facility]{.underline},
[irrespective of its private or public nature]{.underline}, [with a view
to fostering the prevention of CBRN events]{.underline}.

Following this line of reasoning, [no new international legal instrument
is necessary to require States to adopt cybersecurity regulations and
strategies]{.underline}. Indeed, [current international law]{.underline}
concerning the prevention of harm and mitigation of consequences thereof
[may be]{.underline} easily [construed as encompassing]{.underline}
prevention [of]{.underline} malicious cyber activities -- ie
[cybersecurity]{.underline}. Moreover, the above line of reasoning would
ground the assessment by existing compliance review mechanisms of the
'appropriateness' of States' cybersecurity strategies and plans, insofar
as their inadequacy could generate a harmful event triggering States'
liability under relevant international disaster, environmental or human
rights law. However, [the 'transboundary nature' of ICT implies that no
State can tackle cyber-related issues alone]{.underline}. [Initiatives
aimed at fostering cooperation and harmonisation, in particular at a
regional level,]{.underline}87 [are surely desirable and called
for]{.underline}.

### Tacit bargaining/informal norm development fails -- escalation 

#### Tacit bargaining and norm development risks escalatory environment and bad norms

WHY EXPLICIT BARGAINING IN CYBERSPACE IS NECESSARY

These new interactions, in the form of tacit bargaining, have become
embodied in DoD's 2018 Cyber Strategy as a way to contest malicious
cyber activity. Countering "cyber cam- paigns threatening U.S. military
advantage by defending forward to intercept and halt cyber threats and
by strengthening the cybersecurity of systems and networks that support
DoD missions."\[35\] As Fischerkeller and Harknett explain it:

By describing persistent engagement, operationally, as continuously
engaging and contest- ing adversaries and maneuvering for advantage
below the threshold of armed conflict ... it is reasonable to conclude
that persistent engagement would support a strategic process of tacit
bargaining adopted to develop mutual understandings with adversaries on
accept- able/unacceptable behavior in agreed competition.\[36\]

[Notionally, then, U.S Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) would engage and
contest adversar- ies conducting espionage in cyberspace for economic
gain and thereby counter with conse- quences this unacceptable behavior.
However, tacit bargaining in foreign networks, absent explicit bargains,
risks establishing stable yet undesirable normative
behavior]{.underline}.\[37\] [Instead of the "open, reliable, and
secure" cyberspace envisioned by the US strategy, this risks leaving the
US vulnerable to costly escalatory spirals.]{.underline}

Escalatory Spirals

[Escalatory spirals spawned by cyberspace actions have already
occurred]{.underline}. Examples include Iran accelerating its cyber
development and deployment following the attack on its uranium
enrichment centrifuges (Stuxnet attack\[38\],\[39\]), and Russia's claim
that it was simply respond- ing in kind through cyber means to the
Panama papers release.\[40\] [Predicated on whether cy- berspace becomes
truly offense-dominant or defense-dominant as the domain matures,\[41\]
two types of escalatory spirals may occur in cyberspace:]{.underline}

1\) [A spiral that leads to a standoff with the potential to breach the
limits of "competition short of armed conflict]{.underline}"\[42\]

2\) [A spiral that stabilizes as marginal costs eventually match
marginal gains in a costly competition]{.underline}.\[43\]

[In either case, at least in regards to IP-theft, both of these options
are less desirable than a US-PRC agreement to reciprocate on IP
protection and cooperate on combating the economic threat of
cyber-crime]{.underline} which was the envisioned state of relations in
the 2015 accord.

### Tacit bargaining/informal norm development fails -- no enforcement 

#### Enforcement of tacit norms fail -- lack of consistent application and signaling means no behavior change and risks escalation 

**Kim '22**

(Wonny K. Kim, Innovation and Information Operations Officer in the U.S.

Essential to Forming Desired Norms in Cyberspace," Cyber Defense Review,
Spring 2022, JSTOR, accessed 6/30/22, GDI- TMK)

[In lieu of an explicit agreement, consider if USCYBERCOM had engaged in
tacit actions to punish and thereby compel the PRC to cease its
IP-theft.]{.underline} [US experience with economic sanc- tions has
proven the importance of focusing efforts on the appropriate targets and
communi- cate the desired behavior change.]{.underline}\[44\] As such,
USCYBERCOM's two likely targets would be

1\) Those who authorize and conduct state espionage in cyberspace, as
well as the abetting network infrastructure (PRC cyberspace state
espionage)

2\) Those that receive and exploit the stolen IP (IP-theft recipients).

Targeting PRC cyberspace state espionage

[While disrupting or degrading the PRC's IP-theft enabling
infrastructure is appealing, this approach is likely to be unhelpful for
norm formation because the US is faced with a "Cheap Talk" dilemma of
its own. This is because the US is motivated to disrupt or degrade this
target for counterintelligence against espionage
writ-large.]{.underline}\[45\] [Even if explanatory commu- nications
accompany the counter-action and give IP-theft as the reason why it was
imposed, there is no reason for the PRC to trust that these actions
would end as the US benefits from the disruption. Furthermore, as the
PRC would most likely not resume espionage from a network that is known
to be compromised, there is no value proposition for the PRC to have the
US cease its disruption or degradation activities]{.underline}. This is
the [antithesis for driving desired behavior change since it is
necessary that the adversary sees both the prospect and value in the
punishment ending when the egregious IP-theft behavior
ends]{.underline}.\[46\] [Tacit bargaining in this situation exacerbates
the trust dilemma, not alleviates it.]{.underline} Instead[, the US
incurs ongoing]{.underline} manpower and resource [costs to defend
forward]{.underline} in order to suppress IP-theft, and the [US and PRC
are embroiled in an escalatory spiral]{.underline} in pursuit of
marginal advantages over each other. As such[, tacit bargaining, even
with explanatory communications, contributes little to the development
of the desired norm.]{.underline}

[If the US could effectively disable all PRC espionage, that would
eliminate IP-theft, but that is unrealistic.]{.underline} Again, the
Iranian response to Stuxnet shows that an escalatory spiral is
invariably in the offing given the low barrier to entry into
cyberspace.\[47\] Even DoD acknowl- edges the futility of attempting to
achieve total dominance.\[48\]

### Tacit bargaining/informal norm development fails -- retaliation fails

#### Retaliation for IP theft absent explicit bargaining and agreement limited deterrent effect -- minimize norm development and risk retaliation

Spring 2022, JSTOR, accessed 6/30/22, GDI- TMK)

Targeting IP-theft recipients

Turning to the second set of targets, the IP-theft recipients, the US
has followed "a two-pronged approach to combat economic espionage: (1)
reducing theft by educating and training the pri- vate sector how to
improve security and safeguard secrets,\[49\] and (2) federally
prosecuting offenders."\[50\] This latter approach has yielded a mixed
bag\[51\] with few convictions under the 1996 Economic Espionage
Act,\[52\] none involving cyber espionage. [Considering that IP-theft
continues to plague the US at enormous scale,\[53\] prosecuting
offenders does not seem to have effectively stemmed or deterred
cyber-enabled IP-theft,]{.underline} anecdotal arguments to the contrary
notwithstanding.\[54\] Whether US actions targeting non-cyber actors,
including the Department of Justice's recently concluded China
Initiative,\[55\] are successful at reducing espionage is outside the
scope of this article.

A potential third US option is to [threaten US cyberspace retaliation
against businesses that exploit stolen US IP. This is likely to have
some deterrent effect on IP-theft recipients' behavior]{.underline}.
Examples of such potential punitive actions abound, from
denial-of-service attacks against network infrastructure to malware akin
to NotPetya\[56\] or high-profile ransomware attacks.\[57\] However,
[without an explicit bargain, these actions invite tit-for-tat
reciprocal responses against US economic targets]{.underline}. [Even if
we assume that attribution for these actions makes them discernible from
the background noise of cybercrime, without an explicit bar- gain, any
US claim to legitimacy for its tacit actions is severely weakened,
especially con- sidering these actions would be conducted on foreign
networks outside of US sovereignty.]{.underline} [This greatly
diminishes the value to normative behavior formation and lowers the
barrier for retaliatory PRC action]{.underline}. Absent the explicit
agreement, the PRC can simply claim the US vio- lated their sovereign
networks and reciprocate in kind. As such, prosecuting this target set
with tacit actions in cyberspace also carries the potential for an
escalatory spiral, not unlike the current US-PRC trade-war. [The
solution must include consideration for PRC domestic enforcement, which
manifests in the prospect for cooperation discussed later
herein.]{.underline}

### Explicit bargaining solves -- behavioral convergence

#### Behavioral convergence around limitations only way to create sustainable cyber norms 

**Kim '22**

Essential to Forming Desired Norms in Cyberspace," Cyber Defense Review,
Spring 2022, JSTOR, accessed 6/30/22, GDI- TMK)

Prospect of Punishment and Retaliation

[Tacit bargains without explicit bargains risk escalatory spirals;
explicit bargains need to be enforced]{.underline}. Had USCYBERCOM and
other US agencies acted in defense of the 2015 U.S.-- China Cyber
Agreement by imposing punitive actions in response to PRC
transgressions, this punishment would have helped to deter future
transgressions.\[58\] Even Fischerkeller and Harknett support the dual
importance of explicit and tacit bargains when they advocate for "an
aligned application of them to the strategic realities the United States
faces."\[59\] They write further:

[The success of a strategic framework for constructing cyber norms
grounded in per- sistent engagement and tacit bargaining will depend, in
part, on how well states commu- nicate their national interests in
cyberspace. Behavioral convergence around definable limitations is how
sustainable cyber norms can be constructed.\[6]{.underline}0\]

[Those communicated defined limitations are the basis for explicit
bargains, which confer legitimacy on retaliatory action; the prospect of
retaliatory action and ensuing escalatory spirals supports behavioral
convergence]{.underline}. This is where we see the convergence of
explicit and tacit bargains[. Even in the relatively benign costly
competition scenario, the level of competition tacit bargaining will
spawn will always be less desirable than a cyberspace characterized by
cooperation. The US's failure to respond to PRC violations
unfortunately, but predictably, emboldened PRC
exploitation]{.underline}. However, while it becomes evident that ex-
plicit bargains and tacit enforcement are both necessary, this argument
also leads to another question in the shadow of a potential escalatory
spiral: what happens if the PRC reciprocates in kind against punishment,
despite an explicit bargain? This question highlights the impor- tance
of the prospect of cooperation.

### AT norms can't be enforced 

####  Explicit frameworks enable enforcement -- lack of explicit bargaining reason for SQuo failures -- 2015 China Agreement proves

[The 2015 U.S.--China Cyber Agreement states that "the United States and
China agree that neither country's government will conduct or knowingly
support cyber-enabled theft of intel- lectual property,]{.underline}
including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with
the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or
commercial sectors."\[18\] The par- ties also [pledged to investigate
and mitigate malicious cyber activities]{.underline} emanating from
their respective territories[, and to support development of
"appropriate norms of state behavior in cyberspace.]{.underline}"\[19\]
Post-accord, similar agreements were made between the PRC and other G-20
members.\[20\] [Yet the PRC's active theft of IP have since
continued.\[21\]]{.underline}

[Continued IP theft has led]{.underline} Dr. Michael P.
[Fischerkeller]{.underline} of the Institute for Defense Analyses
[and]{.underline} Dr. Richard J. [Harknett]{.underline} of the
University of Cincinnati to [argue that explicit bargaining, which
involves "international conference or bilateral diplomacy and treaty
negotiations,"\[22\] has significant limitations in the cyber domain
because participants would not "trust the other to any agreement
explicitly reached."]{.underline}\[23\] They write:

Consider, for example, the 2015 agreement Presidents Obama and Xi, which
committed that neither country would conduct or knowingly support
cyber-enabled theft of intellectu- al property for commercial gain. ...
This explicit agreement failed not because of any deficit in U.S.
diplomatic bargaining skills, but because the bargaining process itself
was not ap- propriate for the strategic competitive space to which it
was applied.\[24\]

Instead, [Fischerkeller and Harknett urge the use of tacit bargaining to
develop normative be- havior in cyberspace.]{.underline} Tacit bargains
are defined by Schelling as "informal agreements.arrived at 'not by
verbal bargaining, but by maneuver, by actions, and by statements and
declarations that are not direct communication to the enemy.'"\[25\]

[It is important to recognize that these two processes are not mutually
exclusive]{.underline}. If the US had responded to violations of the
U.S.--China Cyber Agreement\[26\] with more than mere
words,\[27\],\[28\],\[29\] for example, with palpable actions against
IP-theft recipients, the accord may have established an international
norm and deterred future transgressions. Moreover, respons- es would not
have had to be constrained to cyberspace: threat of economic sanctions
is what compelled the PRC to enter into the accord in the first
place.\[30\] [Failure of the explicit bargain was not due to any
structural realities of cyberspace, but, rather, to "Cheap Talk;"\[31\]
the un- derlying potential payoffs for the PRC decision calculus ran
counter to the explicit agreement]{.underline}. [Xi had reason to
convince Obama that it was in the PRC's interests and intentions to
respect IP, yet the PRC's benefits from violating the agreement
outweighed the prospective marginal cost, particularly if the prospect
of US follow-through on the threat of sanctions diminished.]{.underline}
As US enforcement of the agreement lagged,\[32\] the prospect of
punishment diminished, and the calculus shifted in favor of IP-theft.
Alternatively, the PRC may have perceived the prospective value of
economic cooperation diminishing, given difficult trade negotiations
throughout 2017- 2018.\[33\] [Either way, if actors are believed to be
rational, trust in the agreement failed because interests were no longer
aligned. The take away lesson should have been to enforce agree- ments,
not necessarily that new interactions\[34\] in cyberspace are required
to develop norms.]{.underline}

## Cyber signaling

### Cyber signaling -- de-escalation

convey to targets that they possess the capability to impose an
advantageous outcome]{.underline} and that they are resolved to do so,
[while also managing the risks of unintended escal- ation and
war]{.underline}.1 Much of the traditional signaling literature focuses
on how to communicate resolve through costly signaling.2 Beyond resolve,
[states can also signal capabilities through brandishing them or
conducting mili- tary demonstrations]{.underline}.3 [Less studied in the
signaling literature is how states can use signals to manage escalation
risks or de-escalate crises]{.underline}. However, as Glenn H. Snyder
and Paul Diesing note, even during crises where one side seeks to
maximize its strategic objectives, it will also seek to reduce escal-
ation risks.4

[Despite the prevalence of cyber operations in contemporary
international crises, there is nascent theoretical and empirical work on
how cyberattacks shape crisis dynamics and, in particular, the different
ways such attacks could function as signals]{.underline}.5 In this
article, we develop and test a theory of cyber signaling. We argue that,
[in some crisis contexts---particularly those where leaders are
simultaneously managing domestic political pressure to take a harder
stance and the desire to avoid escalatory actions]{.underline}---[[cyber
oper- ations have a distinct utility for]{.underline}]{.mark} what
Snyder and Diesing [term ["accommodative"
signaling]{.underline}]{.mark}.6 This is due to two important
characteristics. First, [[cyber operations generate limited effects
relative to other capabilities,]{.underline} [so their use could
demonstrate a willingness to avoid more costly actions that increase
escalation risks.]{.underline}]{.mark} Second[, [the plausibly deniable
nature of cyber operations allows states to placate nationalist
constituencie]{.underline}]{.mark}[s,]{.underline} typically through
permitting proxy groups to conduct low-cost attacks, [[while exploit-
ing ambiguities about state responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
other words[, [cyber operations as accommodative signals work for many
of the same reasons that they fail as coercive signals: they do not hurt
and they are ambiguous.]{.underline}]{.mark}

To test our argument, we explore how states use cyber operations during
international crises across five case studies that vary in the presence
or absence, as well as the nature of, cyber operations during a crisis.
We find [strong evidence to support our claim that states sometimes
choose to use cyber operations for signaling purposes and that certain
types of cyber operations can act as accommodative signals]{.underline}.
We also find that [accommo- dative cyber signals are correlated with
crisis de-escalation]{.underline}, although further research is needed
to substantiate a causal link. Nevertheless, [our analysis offers a
plausible explanation for recent empirical findings that [cyber oper-
ations are not associated with escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}.7

Signaling in International Politics

[Signals involve statements (literal messages) or actions (military
maneuvers) meant to shape the target's image of the signaling
state]{.underline}.8 [Signals often rely on implied, mutual
understandings]{.underline} [about the meaning behind statements or
actions;]{.underline} and actions in particular are often coupled with
messages.9 [Signaling is foundational to theories of coercion and crisis
bargaining because it helps states shape the perceptions
and]{.underline}, ultimately, [behavior]{.underline} of an opponent[.
Successful coercion rests]{.underline} [on]{.underline} [clearly
communicating]{.underline} to a target what the coercing state expects
of it---[if you do X, then Y will follow]{.underline}.10 And [the target
must perceive the message to be credible rather than merely "cheap
talk.]{.underline}"11

The bulk of the signaling literature focuses on how states can make
their signals credible through conveying resolve.12 However, [we argue
that cyber operations are often used as signals of accommodation---not
just resolve.]{.underline} Moreover, [to understand cyber signaling, the
signaling literature on accom- modation and the role of secrecy is
particularly importan]{.underline}t.13 Our theory of cyber signaling
merges and builds on these to present a framework for how cyber
operations could function as accommodative signals.

Signaling for Resolve Versus Accommodation

Snyder and Diesing's foundational work on coercive diplomacy emphasizes
that [almost all international crises contain elements of both coercion
and accommodation]{.underline}.14 [For accommodation, resolve is less
imperative than more conciliatory signaling objectives,]{.underline}
such as willingness to make conces- sions, compromise, save face, and
avoid war.15 [Crisis management]{.underline}, as Snyder and Diesing
define it, [entails ensuring a state can achieve its stra- tegic
interests and mitigate potential risks of escalation.]{.underline} [The
challenge "is to find the optimum mix or trade-off between coercion and
accommoda- tion]{.underline} in the particular crisis context, given the
distribution of values and military power among the participants."16

[The distinction between coercion and accommodation rests on the rela-
tive emphasis on "winning" versus mitigating the risks of
war]{.underline}. [Coercion weighs the former more heavily, whereas
accommodation seeks to "reach some settlement that promises to defuse
the issue as a potential source of future crises"---without making too
many painful concessions]{.underline}.17 Nevertheless, each contains
elements of the other; [coercive strategies may include accommodative
tactics meant to address controlling escalation risks, and accommodative
strategies may include coercive tactics that seek to minimize
losses]{.underline}.18 Characteristics of accommodative actions include
demonstrating restraint, information sharing, clarifying shared
expectations and norms regarding limits on conflict, or creating space
for negotiations and diplomacy.19 Accommodative signaling is linked to
crisis de-escalation because the former can enable the latter. [Even a
"controlled reprisal" that is less escalatory than the prior action
could prompt both sides to de-escalate]{.underline}.20

Public Versus Secret Signaling

Much of the signaling literature assumes signaling occurs in the open to
enhance its credibility, whereas private talk is "cheap talk."21
However, [secret signaling can also be an effective tool of escalation
management.]{.underline} Synder and Diesing explicitly link the decision
to signal in public or private with coercive versus accommodative
strategies. [Although they argue that public threats may enhance
credibility, such threats also increase escalation risks through
creating mutual public commitments and invoking prestige.]{.underline}
Conversely, [private threats enable risk avoidance because they are more
deniable]{.underline}. Similarly, private communication increases the
probability of a peaceful settlement but also reduces the chances that
any one actor will maximize its own objectives.22 Therefore, Snyder and
Diesing posit that private communication generally lends itself to
accommodative strategies and public communication lends itself to
coercive strategies.23 Recent research uncovers similar findings:
[privacy and secrecy can enable signalers to save face, avoid paying
potential domestic costs, and reduce escal- ation risks]{.underline}.24

What Is Cyber Signaling Good For?

[Academic research finds that cyber operations have limited utility for
sig- naling resolve]{.underline}.25 [However, there is little research
on the role of cyber oper- ations as accommodative
signals]{.underline}.26 Brandon Valeriano and Benjamin Jensen argue that
[cyber operations may provide "a means of signaling future escalation
risk as well as a cross-domain release valve for crises. Rival states
use cyber operations as a substitute for riskier military oper-
ations]{.underline}." Drawing on their prior empirical findings about
the relative absence of meaningful escalation dynamics in cyberspace,
Valeriano and Jensen suggest this could be because [cyber operations
"offer great powers escalatory offramps]{.underline}."27 We build a
theoretical framework for why and under what conditions signaling in
cyberspace could serve accommodative purposes. Specifically, we argue
that [the same factors that make cyber oper- ations suboptimal as costly
signals of resolve also make them good for sig- naling for
accommodation, especially the relatively limited effects cyber
operations cause and their plausibly deniable nature.]{.underline}
Moreover, we contend that [states can strategically leverage one of
these important aspects of cyberspace---secrecy---to support
accommodative strategies.]{.underline}

#### Attribution and plausible deniability allow states to choose to level of secrecy -- opening up space for placating constituencies and negotiating

Implications of the Strategic Use of Secrecy for Signaling

However, the effects of cyber operations alone do not offer a complete
explanation of how cyber tools could function as accommodative signals.
[We argue that, in addition to effects, how states choose to take
advantage of opportunities for more or less secrecy and ambiguity
surrounding their conduct of cyber operations also plays a signaling
role]{.underline}. For this aspect of our argument, there are [two types
of audiences for the signal: the adversary regime and domestic
constituencies observing the government conducting or permitting a cyber
action during a crisis.]{.underline} Moreover, the deliberate
manipulation of secrecy is dyadic---[both the signaling state and the
target make choices during a crisis about the visibility of the cyber
operation itself and the extent to which it is linked to the
government.]{.underline}

Secrecy can manifest in different ways in cyberspace. For instance,
[main- taining secrecy about the cyber operation itself can be a
condition for its success]{.underline}. Revealing information about how
a state has gained access to a tar- get, as well as a state's tool kit
(especially if highly tailored), prior to or during the course of an
operation can negate its efficacy because it permits defenders to take
concrete steps to render the threat inert.55 However, [our argument
focuses on]{.underline} a different form of secrecy: [attribution and
plausible deniability in cyber operations.]{.underline}56 In a technical
sense, [cyberspace enables actors to conceal their responsibility for
cyberattacks because it facilitates the obfuscation of points of
departure for attacks]{.underline}.57 These [technical meth- ods could
also be coupled with deliberate efforts to obscure command and control
for cyberattacks]{.underline}, such as employing cyber proxies with
varying degrees of connection to the state to conduct offensive
operations on the latter's behalf.58 How much direct control governments
exert over cyber proxies varies. For instance, governments could co-opt
unwitting proxy actors---for example, by distributing malware in
patriotic hacker forums (as occurred during the Russian-Georgian
conflict in 2008). Or they could establish more direct relationships
with groups that knowingly act on their behalf (e.g., the relationship
between Russian intelligence agencies and the group known as "Fancy
Bear.").59

In relatively rare instances[, some states have taken responsibility for
their own cyber operations]{.underline}. Examples include US Cyber
Command acknowledg- ing in December 2021 that it had conducted
operations to counter ransom- ware groups; the September 2017 leak by a
senior official in the Trump administration that the US Cyber Command
had conducted a sustained DDoS attack against North Korea's
Reconnaissance General Bureau; and, during the Obama administration,
Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's com- ments in a February 2016 press
conference acknowledging a US role in cyberattacks against the Islamic
State in Mosul.60

[Avoiding attribution is a strategic choice, not an operational require-
ment]{.underline}.61 Therefore, [the extent to which states are public
or private about their role in cyber operations has signaling
implications]{.underline}. Whereas some lit- erature contends that the
plausible deniability of cyber operations increases escalation risks, we
hypothesize that the opposite is true.62 In this sense[, our argument is
a twist on prior theories positing that secret signaling can widen the
bargaining space between states, allowing for crisis
resolution]{.underline}. We argue that, distinct from perfect secrecy,
[the ambiguities of cyber oper- ations that straddle public and secret
realms---visible, but with uncertainty about responsibility or command
and control---create opportunities for states to simultaneously signal
to multiple audiences]{.underline} (domestic publics and the adversary).
This allows governments to be perceived at home as making some response
to an adversary during a crisis while ensuring the adversary perceives
that the action's effects are relatively minor or proportionate to avoid
further escalation. [Moreover, this also presents the adversary with a
choice to allow the ambiguous status quo to persist, or to ratchet up
the crisis by directly calling out the opposing side]{.underline}. Table
1 depicts some hypothesized implications for crisis dynamics.63

As depicted in the top left cell of Table 1, [during a crisis the target
of a cyberattack may choose to preserve plausible deniability---even
when it has some degree of confidence that its rival is responsible---to
prevent further escalation]{.underline}. [Adversaries can implicitly
convey a mutual interest in maintain- ing stability]{.underline}. In
other words, [the strategic choice to not go public, or even to issue
vague and ambiguous public statements in response to a cyberat- tack,
can also act as an accommodative signa]{.underline}l. This is especially
likely if the target perceives political dynamics domestically or within
the rival state (e.g., nationalist protests or hawkish veto players)
that may increase the risks of unwanted escalation. Conversely, if one
party goes public with attribution while the other seeks to maintain
plausible deniability, it can be more difficult for the other side to
offer concessions. Finally, if attribution is mutually made public, it
is unlikely that cyber operations can act as accommodative signals
because both sides will perceive less of an advantage in appearing to
back down.

### Cyber signaling -- limited effects solve escalation 

#### Limited effects and secrecy make cyber signaling possible -- de-escalates by signaling to adversary and domestic constituencies -- secrecy provides choices for governments to signal accommodations

Characteristics of Cyberspace for Accommodative Signaling

[There are two sets of audiences for accommodative cyber signaling: the
adversary government and domestic constituencies on both
sides]{.underline}. In this context, [two core characteristics of cyber
operations]{.underline} make them [useful for accommodative signaling:
their relatively limited effects and the role of secrecy.]{.underline}28
First, the [relatively minimal effects of some types of cyber opera-
tions can signal restraint to an adversary.]{.underline} Second, in
crises where neither party seeks escalation but there is domestic
political pressure for the gov- ernment to take a more aggressive
stance, the [plausibly deniable nature of some cyber operations allows
leaders to placate hawkish domestic constitu- encies]{.underline} by
responding [while avoiding more strident actions that might trig- ger
escalation]{.underline}. Moreover, [ambiguity surrounding the level of
state responsibility allows leaders]{.underline} to "test the waters"
with the other side, [assess- ing the adversary's
willingness]{.underline} [to avoid assigning responsibility]{.underline}
to the gov- ernment and therefore refraining from further stoking
nationalist sentiments.

In this sense[, our argument about secrecy differs from existing work on
secret signaling. In cyberspace, there can be a middle ground between
purely covert cyber actions that are only observed by the
target]{.underline} (if at all) [and public operations for which a
government takes responsibility]{.underline}.29 [It is precisely through
these noisy, ambiguous, and low-cost cyberattacks that accommodative
signaling can occur]{.underline}. In other words, in addition to a cyber
operation's effects, [the level of secrecy surrounding a cyber operation
is a choice states make; and the decision by both parties to maintain
plausible deniability can signal accommodation]{.underline}.

#### Magnitude of cyber operations impact signaling -- permanence, scope, criticality of target and level of harm determine

The Strategic Effects of Cyber Operations

[Cyber operations encompass a range of activity that occurs in the
digital realm]{.underline}, including gaining access to computer
networks for the purposes of exfiltrating sensitive information (cyber
espionage); disrupting, degrading, destroying, or manipulating data that
resides in or transits through a net- work, or the system itself
(cyberattacks); or weaponizing sensitive or private information to
influence an audience's perception (cyber-enabled information
operations).30 In this article, we focus on cyberattacks and exclude
cyber espionage and cyber-enabled information operations.31

We argue that [the magnitude of the effects of cyber operations affects
their signaling potential]{.underline}. [Therefore, to measure the
effects of cyber opera- tions, we identify four areas: the permanence of
the effects; the scope of the operation; the criticality of the target;
and the level of harm.]{.underline} We focus on strategic-level effects
because these pertain to how cyber operations influence broader crisis
dynamics.

[We operationalize the permanence of effects as the target's relative
ease and speed of recovery]{.underline}. A r[elated]{.underline} aspect
[is the reversibility of the effects of a cyber
operation]{.underline}.32 [The most straightforward type of impermanent
cyber operation is a distributed denial of service (DDoS)
attack]{.underline}, which disrupts a network's functioning by
overwhelming the target's processing capacity (typically through jamming
its bandwidth via the sheer volume of requests) [but does not cause
lasting damage]{.underline}.33 For example, the 2016 the Mirai Internet
of Things (IoT) botnet launched a massive wave of DDoS attacks that
infected six hundred thousand IoT devices but only caused a tempor- ary
interruption in service.34

However, even beyond DDoS attacks, [many cyber operations "produce
relatively transient and/or reversible effects."]{.underline}35 [Even
for operations that des- troy data, capabilities and functions can often
be reconstituted within a relatively short period of
time]{.underline}.36 After the North Korean cyberattacks against South
Korean banks and Sony Pictures in 2013---both of which destroyed files
and damaged computers---the targets "are still in business, and none
spent more than an inconsequential amount of time recov- ering."37 In
contrast, [some cyber operations produce longer-term or even permanent
effects]{.underline}, such as the Stuxnet computer worm discovered in
2010 that caused permanent, physical damage to Iranian centrifuges.38

[A cyber operation's scope addresses the range of targets against which
it delivers an effect.]{.underline} Some cyber capabilities may widely
proliferate across net- works but only produce effects against the
specific systems that are vulner- able to them.39 [Because cyber
capabilities are comprised of computer code written to produce some kind
of effect against another computer, they can- not be employed against
just any desired targe]{.underline}t.40 For example, although Stuxnet
was discovered in computers around the world, it only caused destructive
effects against the centrifuges in Natanz.41 In contrast, whereas the
2017 WannaCry ransomware attack, attributed to North Korea's Lazarus
Group, only affected systems running a version of Windows 7, the scope
was nevertheless wide, as it affected hundreds of thousands of com-
puters globally across a range of industries that were running the older
software.42

[The criticality of the target, at the strategic level, is a function of
how vital the government perceives that target to be]{.underline}. [In
the most extreme case this could be regime survival, but it also
includes core national and eco- nomic security interests]{.underline}.
How a particular government defines criticality for specific entities
varies. For instance, the infrastructure that enables authori- tarian
governments to control data that ingresses and egresses across sover-
eign digital borders and to surveil domestic populations may be a
critical target for those regimes but is less relevant for open
societies.43

[Finally, an essential aspect of cyber operations' strategic effects is
the level of harm to the target.]{.underline} Most malicious cyber
activity to date has not risen to a threshold of significant harm,
violent effects, or loss of life.44 This is especially the case when
compared to other military capabilities.45 That said, [there are
different ways to operationalize level of harm. One potential metric is
loss of life]{.underline}. [To date, no one has reportedly died as a
dir- ect result of a cyberattack]{.underline}, despite over thirty years
of recorded cyber oper- ations.46 [Even in hypothetical catastrophic
scenarios, the cost in terms of human casualties is relatively low
compared to other military capabilities]{.underline}. For instance, [a
common worst-case scenario is a cyberattack on a power
grid]{.underline}.47 However, the 2015 Russian cyberattack against
Ukraine's power grid, the first known example of an offensive cyber
operation targeting a state's power grid, did not lead to any reported
casualties.48

[It is also possible to measure the harm cyber operations inflict in
treas- ure rather than blood. According to this metric, the financial or
economic costs of cyberattacks are significant.]{.underline} For
example, the total cost of the most expensive cyberattack in history,
the 2017 NotPetya attack, is estimated at \$10 billion.49 However[,
governments have largely avoided characterizing these operations as
crossing an "act of war" or "use of force" threshold]{.underline}.50
[While still of strategic consequence, cyber operations]{.underline}
(especially absent physical violence) [appear to be perceived
differently than other military operations]{.underline}.51

### Cyber signaling -- alternative to kinetic attacks

#### Cyber effects provide alternative to kinetic physical attacks -- and de-escalate conflicts

De-Escalation of International Crises", Security Studies, 18 Feb 2022,
Taylor and Francis, accessed July 1, 2022, JCP-LL\]

Given different approaches, we chose to measure level of harm in terms
of the target state's perception of a cyber operation's national
security con- sequences. Perception may not perfectly align with the
objective human or economic costs. For instance, the SolarWinds supply
chain breach, revealed in December 2020, compromised many US federal
government and private sector networks but did not cause loss of life.52
Nevertheless, the US gov- ernment chose to activate the response process
outlined in Presidential Policy Directive 41, which applies to cyber
incidents that rise to a certain level of significance.53 This example
illustrates how the perceived level of harm ultimately is a political or
strategic assessment, rather than an object- ive measure of calculatable
damage.

[Taken together, the strategic effects of most cyber operations are
rela- tively limited when compared to other types of military
operations.]{.underline} That said, [different types of cyber operations
vary in their level of effects.]{.underline} These two points have
[implications for accommodative signaling]{.underline}. Specifically, in
the context of an international crisis, [the relative effects of a cyber
oper- ation inform how the adversary perceives the intent behind the
signal.]{.underline}54 In this sense, [the key audience for a cyber
operation's effects is the adversary government.]{.underline} [Because
cyber operations lack the physical violence and per- manent
destruction]{.underline} associated with other military
capabilities---and may even be less painful than some economic
instruments, such as sanctions--- [they could signal restraint relative
to other options]{.underline}. Moreover, [the choice of a disruptive
cyber operation that has temporary effects, in comparison to a
destructive cyber operation with longer-term effects, could also send an
accommodative signal.]{.underline} The sequencing of the cyber operation
could also inform its interpretation. For instance, [if a cyberattack
follows a kinetic one, it could be perceived as a de-escalatory
choice.]{.underline}

Case Studies

We evaluate the conditions under which states choose to employ cyber
operations for signaling purposes during international crises, as well
as the differences between cyber operations for accommodative signaling
or for resolve or deterrence, across five crises: the 2012
Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute between China and Japan; the 2015 crisis
between Turkey and Russia after Turkey downed a Russian jet during the
Syrian civil war; the 2019 crisis over the Strait of Hormuz between the
United States and Iran; the crisis precipitated by China's 2013
declaration of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ); and the 2018
crisis between Russia and the United States when proxy forces affiliated
with the Russian government attacked American forces in Syria.

To select these cases, we reviewed four datasets comprising hundreds of
cyber incidents from 1999 through June 2020 to identify those where
cyber operations occurred during a geopolitical crisis. We also examined
major think tank reports, policy reports, and news media pertaining to
cyber inci- dents.65 We specifically looked for crises where a contested
political issue was present (e.g., a dispute over territory or a
perceived political threat to a regime) that raised the risk that
military hostilities may take place and where the trigger of the crisis
was not a cyber event but, rather, a broader political issue.66 The vast
majority of observed cyber behavior associated with nation-states occurs
outside of the context of international crises.67

### AT: cyber operations escalate 

#### Cyber operations in a crisis do not lead to escalation -- either reciprocal action or de-escalation -- cases prove effects and secrecy levels differentiate accommodative signaling versus signaling resolve

De-Escalation of International Crises", Security Studies, 18 Feb 2022,

[A few patterns stand out.]{.underline} [Cyber operations during crises
generally did not lead to escalation]{.underline}; [they were typically
followed by a reciprocal cyber operation and/or the de-escalation of the
crisis.]{.underline} Additionally, [most of the cases involved
relatively low-cost cyber operations,]{.underline} such as website
deface- ments and DDoS attacks perpetrated by proxy groups or patriotic
hackers, [rather than highly sophisticated operations that targeted
adversary critical infrastructure or had lasting destructive
effects]{.underline}. There were two exceptions, both of which
reportedly involved the US government (rather than a proxy group) as a
cyber actor: the Strait of Hormuz crisis between the United States and
Iran in June 2019, and the Abqaiq-Khurais attack that led to a crisis
between the United States/Saudi Arabia and Iran in September 2019.68
Therefore, we chose to examine one of those cases---the Strait of Hormuz
crisis---in greater detail as a point of comparison.

The [five cases vary according to the presence or absence of cyber
opera- tions during the crisis; and, of the cases involving cyber
operations, the operations vary in their type and role in the
crisis]{.underline}. Although there is an inherent logic to the argument
that cyber operations as accommodative sig- nals could facilitate crisis
de-escalation, [the overwhelming tendency of most crises, particularly
those involving nuclear powers, to resolve short of major escalation
makes it more difficult to empirically establish a causal relation- ship
between the former and latter---or to find cases with meaningful vari-
ation across escalation outcomes]{.underline}. Therefore, the case
studies are meant to serve two purposes. First, given that cyber
operations take place in some crises but not others, the cases aim to
validate our argument that some cyber operations are deliberate signals
rather than superfluous noise. Thi is particularly true for closed
regimes, which monitor (and in some cases control) online activity
within their cyber borders. [Therefore, during a cri- sis, parties may
surmise that cyberattacks originating from a closed state likely occur
with some level of the central government's implicit permis-
sion]{.underline}.69 Second, **[variation across the cases in the types
and characteristics of cyber operations sheds light on the various ways
states use cyber operations during crises]{.underline}, [providing a
means of distinguishing between cyber opera- tions as accommodative
signals versus those meant to serve as signals of resolve or
deterrence.]{.underline}**

[In two of the case studies]{.underline}---the 2012 crisis between China
and Japan and the 2015 crisis between Russia and Turkey---the crises
triggered domestic nationalist sentiments, and private back channels
failed to resolve the issues at hand. In this context, [low-level,
disruptive cyber operations carried out by hacktivist groups or proxies
loosely affiliated with the government func- tioned as accommodative
signals]{.underline}. [There were two audiences for these cyber signals:
nationalist or hawkish domestic constituencies and the adversary
government. These attacks' limited effects, coupled with their highly
visible nature and tenuous connection to the government, enabled leaders
to man- age domestic sentiments while avoiding more aggressive action
that could further escalate the situation]{.underline}. In response, the
targets avoided publicly link- ing the cyberattacks with the adversarial
government.

In contrast, [in two of the three cases that did not produce significant
nationalist sentiments]{.underline}---the 2013 ADIZ crisis and the 2018
crisis between the United States and Russia in Syria---[no cyber
operations took place and the crises resolved through a combination of
diplomacy and military maneuvers, both public and private]{.underline}.
[The absence of cyber operations in these instances demonstrates that
the choice to conduct or allow cyber operations in some cases but not
others is deliberate]{.underline}, providing inherent plausibility to
our argument that cyber operations could be signals.

Finally, [one case]{.underline}---the 2019 crisis between the United
States and Iran over the Strait of Hormuz---[involved a cyberattack in
conjunction with the absence of major nationalist
mobilization.]{.underline} However, unlike the first two cases
containing cyber operations, [in this instance government forces
reportedly conducted a cyberattack directly and covertly, tailored it to
a specific adversary intelligence organization, and degraded adversary
capabil- ities for a sustained period. This is suggestive of a cyber
signal of resolve, rather than accommodation.]{.underline}

Altogether, [the five cases illustrate the characteristics of cyber
operations as signals of accommodation versus resolve. They also suggest
the condi- tions under which the former are more likely to be observed:
in crises where leaders strive to balance nationalist domestic
sentiments while avoid- ing actions that would exacerbate the situation,
and where other forms of private communications may not be as
viable.]{.underline} Table 2 depicts a summary of the cases and the core
findings.

## Military to military exercises -- general 

### Expand military to military exercises

Action Plan for the Next Five Years

[To make NATO future-proof, it must be cyber-secure and
operational]{.underline}. But is it doing enough to address the complex
and evolving challenges of cyberspace? [NATO's strategic challenge is to
blend its successful conventional deterrence functions with a new
strategy for cyber action]{.underline}[. [NATO's ability to send a
collective message of resistance and to establish a credible threat
response is its most valuable asset on the cyber-security
front.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Four sets of actions for NATO are proposed. First, [denying covertness
by attribution: NATO should persuade opponents that they cannot be
clandestine in their cyber actions]{.underline}. NATO and its members
need to demonstrate that it is difficult or impossible to act covertly
and be clear about attributing responsibility for cyberattacks.

Until recently, governments did not publicly release details on cyber
incidents. [But since 2018, public disclosures of cyberattacks by
several Western powers indicate a new multinational policy of state
transpar- ency. The growing relevance of attribution is partially due to
states becoming better at attributing cyber operations]{.underline}.1
Greater public knowledge of cyberattacks heightens awareness of cyber
conflicts and leads to greater public acceptance of cyber
countermeasures.

Ultimately[[, what matters is that states engaging in unlawful actions
using cyber means will face conse- quences. With attribution,
policymakers show that they know what is happening in these networks and
can investigate incidents]{.underline}.]{.mark} It also clearly spells
out unacceptable behavior and can help create state prac- tice. The
[[best way to implement the international norms is by calling out
behavior and having conse- quences when these norms are
breached]{.underline}]{.mark}. Attribu- tion will make clear to the
malicious actor that their actions will be seen and addressed. It is the
basis, under international law, for countermeasures and self-defense.

When should states publicly attribute cyberat- tacks? [Effective public
attribution requires a clear understanding of the attributed cyber
operation and the cyber-threat actor, but also the broader geopo-
litical environment, allied positions and activities, and the legal
context]{.underline}. The [public attribution frame- work]{.underline}
put forward by Max Smeets and Florian Egloff in March 202127
[distinguishes four factors that act as enablers or constraints in
public attribution. These factors are intelligence, incident severity,
geopolitical context, and post-attribution actions.]{.underline} The
combina- tion of these four components enables consistent deci-
sion-making about whether to publicly disseminate information about an
adversary's actions, privately tell the adversary, or restrict knowledge
of the intrusion to the government and potentially other partners.

[[Collecting and processing intelligence---infor- mation about foreign
countries and their agents--- provides a technical basis for
attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}. How could allies improve intelligence
sharing to conduct more rapid attribution and enable a response to
adver- sary cyber activity? During the Nordic-Baltic foreign ministers
meeting in Tallinn in September 2020, a 90-minute tabletop exercise was
organized28 to test the ministers' ability to respond to and attribute
an esca- lating cyberattack. They answered multiple-choice questions on
communication of and possible diplo- matic countermeasures to the
attack. The minis- ters learned through first-hand experience that a
timely exchange of technical intelligence can be key in attributing any
cyberattack. "The shared view \[of the countries involved\]---especially
when it comes to complicated issues---is crucial," said Urmas Reinsalu,
Foreign Minister of Estonia.29

[Attribution is only as good as the information that allies are willing
to share. NATO's value can be in becoming the preferred platform for
sharing cyber information]{.underline}. General Paul Nakasone, who heads
US Cyber Command, told the House Armed Services subcommittee on
intelligence that "in 35 years" he has never seen a better sharing of
accu- rate, timely, and actionable intelligence than what has transpired
with Ukraine.30 [Sharing information and intelligence with allies
"builds coalitions" and can "shine a light on disinformation"
campaigns]{.underline}, like the one Russia used to lay the groundwork
for their invasion of Ukraine.

As the second course of action[**[, NATO should use the current crisis
to accelerate the progress with setting up NATO's own cyber command and
sharpen allied responses to malicious cyber actions]{.underline}**.
[Overall, this would give more credibility to its cyber
defense]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} In February 2019, allies
endorsed a set of tools to respond to cumulative cyber activities, but
not much has happened to take it forward. [It is now time to build upon
this set and develop concrete steps at the political, military, and
technical levels to model alli- ance behavior according to the threat
landscape.]{.underline} This means a sharper focus on future responses
to high- and low-end cyberattacks along with concrete deter- rence
actions and tools for individual sectors and target types. [Much of this
is based on the high-end cyber capabilities of select individual allies
called "volunteer sovereign cyber effects," where cyber- capable nations
deliver voluntarily offensive cyber effects on a target designated by an
operational-levelcommander]{.underline}. The [NATO Cyber Command would
be responsible for matching military needs with the willingness and
capabilities of the nations potentially able to deliver such
effects]{.underline}.31 **[[The alliance should clarify which allies are
responsible for offensive cyber operations against certain targets and
the informa- tion-sharing and notification
requirements.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[A good plan requires practice. The scenarios of cyber responses that
are under the Article 5 threshold should be regularly practiced,]{.mark}
and the NATO Cooper- ative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE)
[Locked Shields exercise is a good way to do so]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Orga- nized since 2010, it enables cyber-security experts to enhance
their skills in defending national IT systems and critical
infrastructure under real-time attacks. [The focus should be on
realistic scenarios simulating the entire complexity of a massive cyber
incident, including strategic decision-making and legal and
communication aspects. Locked Shields is a unique opportunity to
encourage experimentation, training, and cooperation among allies in an
authentic but safe training environment]{.underline}.

[NATO should also make more use of its Cyber Range]{.underline}, a
platform for NATO exercises and training in Estonia operated by the
Estonian Ministry of Defense. [The Cyber Range already facilitates
NATO's flagship annual cyber defense exercise Cyber Coalition, and NATO
CCDCOE has based Locked Shields on Cyber Range for over a decade. The
versatility and computing power of the platform allows a different,
complex scenario to be simulated every year for an increasing number of
participants. The technical, red-teaming exercise CrossedSwords,
organized by NATO CCDCOE, tests the capabilities and skills needed when
executing a full-spectrum cyber operation in real life, focusing on
experimentation with integrating kinetics and offensive cyber operations
in the context of a modern battlefield]{.underline}. [More operational-
and technical-level joint activ- ities should be practiced]{.underline}
among allies and with like- minded partners in order to contribute to
imposing costs to malicious actors in cyberspace**[. [Given that NATO's
cyber response teams are stretched thin due to protecting NATO's own
networks, bi- and multilateral collaboration enables countries to share
best practices and, in the event of an emergency, provide mutual rapid
assistance in crisis response.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The [cyber exercise Baltic Ghost originated]{.underline} from a series
of cyber defense workshops [in 2013]{.underline} and should be expanded
to include all NATO battlegroups in the Baltics and Poland. [Currently
it is facilitated by the United States European Command with the
objective to develop and sustain cyber partnerships between Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania on one end, and the Mary- land, Michigan, and
Pennsylvania Army National Guards on the other end]{.underline}.
[Building on the success of Baltic [Ghost, regular cyber exercises
should take place in multinational NATO
battlegroups]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [led by the United Kingdom,
Canada, Germany, and the United States, in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
and Poland.]{.underline} [[Future exercises should regularly support
NATO enhanced forward presence forces and train participants to respond
to aggression in a contested, degraded, and denied cyberspace
environment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Military to military exercises - Signaling 

#### Military cyber exercises produces the analysis of cyber issues needed to respond to current threats

accessed 6/30/22, GDI- CC\]

CCDCOE started organizing Locked Shields in 2012--preceded by the Baltic
Cyber Shield, a one-off exercise in 2010. In 2021, [Locked Shields had
over two thousand participants. Thirty countries have participated so
far]{.underline}, including a NATO alliance team and non-NATO member
states Australia and Japan. Over the past decade, [military exercises
have increasingly focused on cyber-related scenarios, which present
unique opportunities and challenges for military planners. The main
opportunities of military cyber exercises lie in the collection and
analysis of data and the signaling of operational
capability]{.underline}. The challenges to military cyber exercises stem
from difficulties defining an appropriate ruleset and the resources
required to create a realistic training environment with realistic
timeframes and dynamics.

Military cyber exercises come in various shapes and forms: from
specific, nationally oriented exercises such as Operation Eligible
Receiver, organized by the U.S. Department of Defense in 1997, to more
general, internationally oriented exercises like Cyber Coalition,
organized annually by NATO. S[ome exercises are more offense-oriented,
such as Crossed Swords, while other games lay the emphasis on defense,
like Locked Shields.]{.underline}

[Military cyber exercises are generally run in a virtual environment.
The benefit of which is the organizer's ability to collect data as the
activities of different teams can be more easily recorded]{.underline}.
Whilst traffic logs and other data are not always easy to digest, [it
often creates the opportunity for more granular analyses of
moves]{.underline} ex post facto.

[Signaling cyber capability is notoriously difficult]{.underline}.
However, [military cyber exercises can be used as a means of signaling
capability and willingness to conduct or respond to cyber
operations]{.underline}. "You cannot parade computer code on the streets
of Moscow", but [you can create a scenario in which you successfully
mitigate simulated malicious code]{.underline} in Moscow's
transportation infrastructure.

### Resiliency 

#### Cyber exercises key in establishing a resilient society in an age of cyber threats -- they build awareness and test responses

[During COVID 19-crisis the security and resilience of critical
information system have been more important than ever
before]{.underline}. Breaches and cyber security incidents impressively
highlighted the importance of cyber security and especially incident
response (ENISA, 2020). [In order to ensure resilience of systems, and
to prepare for a such unpredictable cyber threats, it is necessary to
continuously train people how to purposefully react on these threats and
to communicate within the team under difficult
circumstances]{.underline} (Wilhemson and Svensson, 2014). [Therefore,
exercises especially cyber exercises, play a central role in
establishing a resilient society.]{.underline}

[Cyber exercises have gained a lot of attention throughout recent years,
especially in the cyber security sector, as an important tool for
security training, awareness-building and testing incident
response.]{.underline} The EU emphasizes the importance of this field in
its strategy for the digital decade (European Commission, 2020). [Large
exercises, that make it to the news, such as CyberStorm]{.underline}
(Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), ), [Locked
Shields]{.underline} (The NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of
Excellence, 2021) [or Cyber Europe]{.underline} (ENISA, 2021[),
represent only a small fraction of the exercises carried out. Conducting
cyber exercises also has an educational value. Through interactive
activities, such as simulations and scenarios, exercise participants
apply knowledge in practical situations using techniques and tools they
are familiar with, thereby deepening their understanding of a particular
type of incident]{.underline} (Dewar, 2018).

such a controversial subject]{.underline}. XS is organized by the NATO
CCD COE in the NATO Cyber Range and utilizes a hybrid approach between
cyber-physical and simulated infrastructure.

[Cyber-exercise-specific SA systems are designed to improve SA during
cyber exercises]{.underline}. While traditional SA systems are oriented
toward cyber defenders, [CSX-specific SA systems have been designed to
provide situation awareness feedback]{.underline} not only
[to]{.underline} cyber defenders, but [all participating teams
alike]{.underline}.

FUTURE: ACTIONS TO STRENGTHEN CYBERSECURITY

As the Cyber Coalition demonstrates the actions taken by NATO, this
segment will further elaborate on more aspects that can be covered in
the aforementioned exercises. [The core of NATO cybersecurity efforts
lies at the member-state level.]{.underline}7 The size and severity of
today\'s cyber-attacks involve a new approach to political, military,
and civilian responses. [NATO should take a few effective steps in the
organisation to establish a quick decision-making mechanism while
confronting a cyber-attack. The solution towards more secure cyberspace
lies in the functioning and accountability of member states; currently,
no mechanism exists to ensure that the member states are adhering to the
Cyber Defence Pledge]{.underline} taken in the Warsaw Summit of 2016.
[NATO can discuss and provide expertise, however, there is no apparatus
to enforce that expertise on the member, and the efficiency of the cyber
defence efforts depend on the implementation by the
members]{.underline}.

[The first action can be taken concerning the decision making of NATO,
which is divided into NATO as an organisation and its
members.]{.underline} In the former aspect, [the resource allocation to
NATO should be increased as it will help in not only detecting and
indicating hostile cyber activities but will allow better use of the
civil and military intelligence units]{.underline}. Furthermore, **[the
powers of the Supreme Allied Commander Europe should be increased by the
North Atlantic Council, along with which the CCDCoE should increase
cyber defence activities and exercises as it will increase
efficiency]{.underline}**. [The focus of these exercises should be on
dynamic and challenging cyber crisis-conflict situations, fast
decision-making processes.]{.underline} [Concerning the members' role,
identifying and sharing information about any potential threats to any
of the members should be shared; the national intelligence services
should supply and exchange such information. Allies and willing partners
should continue to work on improving and updating threat
assessments]{.underline}, and facilitating closer intelligence
cooperation.8 Cyber challenges arrive in the form of networks and to
defeat these threats involves an equally well-organized network of
multinational and cross-sector collaboration. CC20 did deal with the
aspect of decision making, however, as explained above, this aspect has
a greater potential to secure the member states of NATO from the cyber
threats.

## MOU

Where to go from here? [The divergence in cyber policy across NATO
member states is problematic. Allies disagree on both the goals of cyber
policy and the ways and means to achieve them. This can cause tension
between allies,]{.underline} especially when it comes to the necessity
and legitimacy of operating on each other's national systems and
networks. [Some may argue that these differences result from differences
in maturity]{.underline}. Some states simply have not caught up with the
latest developments, goes the argument. This assumes a single path to
cyber maturity or that the dynamics of cyberspace pull all states in the
same direction. [It suggests that -- even without major policy
coordination -- allies' cyber policies will converge over
time]{.underline}. [But a more persuasive understanding of the current
trend is that even though states can learn from each other's
institutional progress, differences do not merely stem from states
"lagging behind." These states are on a different policy path. This
means it requires dedicated and sustained policy attention to, at a
minimum, coordinating the different policies of states -- and
potentially bring them closer together.]{.underline}

What can be done to ensure that this divergence in cyber policy does not
cause further friction between allies?11

I have previously proposed a [NATO Memorandum of
Understanding]{.underline} (MoU) [to reduce discord among the allies;
the goal would be to enhance trust, transparency, and confidence between
allies and to improve the]{.underline}

[effectiveness of disrupting and deterring adversaries'operations in
cyberspace]{.underline}.12 The main purpose of the [MoU would be to
reach an agreement on the equities]{.underline} involved in permitting
signatories [to conduct cyber effect operations in each other's
networks]{.underline}---and the relative weight of those equities.

[NATO's potential adversaries are developing offensive cyber

conflicts]{.underline}. [The  constant technological adaptation of the
NATO and national security forces to the current strategic  scenarios is
essential to maintain a reliable defense posture]{.underline}. 

The [EU and NATO are targeted by similar cybersecurity threats that
undermine, in various  degrees, all operational environment
factors]{.underline}, political, military, economic, social,
information,  infrastructure, and their cooperation is leading to common
or complementary defense solutions. 

[By constantly adapting its structure and posture, NATO is able to face
new emerging threats  and to increase its reediness and responsiveness
in all operational domains. The Alliance's  adaptation process comprise
also the development of policies and capabilities for the cyber domain 
designated to improve the understanding of different
threats]{.underline} and risks and its ability to react in order  to
achieve NATO's ambitions for the cyberspace. 

[Given that]{.underline}, over the past few years, [the frequency and
complexity of the cyber-attacks and  their potential to generate
instability grew substantially, the need to achieve consensus for a an 
worldwide recognized legal framework in the cyber domain should become a
high priority]{.underline} for  international organizations.

INTRODUCTION

As the United States ([US) endeavors to estab- lish international norms
in cyberspace, it is critical that it delineate which behavioral norms
it supports, how it plans to establish them, and to what ends the norms
serve.]{.underline} These con- siderations are particularly timely as
the current US administration builds its cybersecurity team and con-
siders pressing issues in cyberspace. In January 2021, President Joe
Biden appointed National Security Agen- cy Cybersecurity Director Anne
Neuberger as Deputy National Security Advisor (DNSA) for Cyber and
Emerg- ing Technology in the National Security Council.\[3\] As reported
then, "Neuberger will be responsible for coordinating the federal
government's cybersecurity efforts, with a likely emphasis on responding
to a mas- sive cyberespionage campaign carried out last year by
suspected Russian hackers \[referencing SolarWinds\], which the
government is still struggling to unravel."\[4\] She has since been
joined in the administration by Chris Inglis, National Cyber Director,
and Jen Easterly, Director of Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).\[5\]

Although the SolarWinds breach was extensive, af- fecting roughly 100
companies and a dozen govern- ment agencies,\[6\] the breach itself was
not a violation of international norms as the operation did not esca-
late beyond espionage.\[7\] [As the US devises its cyber policy, it is
imperative to distinguish between actions taken for counterintelligence
purposes and actions taken to develop international norms in cyberspace.
Espionage is not a violation of an international norm]{.underline}, and
the US does not appear inclined to establish it as such. [Espionage and
counter-espionage are estab- lished behaviors that participants have
tacitly agreed to undertake and assume their associated
costs.]{.underline} Yet some espionage-associated behavior in cyberspace
fall outside these bounds; for example, the US takes exception to
espionage conducted "with the intent of providing competitive advantages
to companies or commercial sectors."\[8\]

[Current literature advocates for tacit bargaining, that is, behavioral
actions and counter-actions, in developing normative behavior in
cyberspace]{.underline}.\[9\] [The dynamics of the 2015 U.S.--China Cy-
ber Agreement,]{.underline} however, [indicate]{.underline} two
important considerations: first, [the necessity of explic- it
bargains]{.underline}, such as international agreements, to support the
formation of desired norms that help avoid costly escalatory spirals.
Second, [how a viable prospect of cooperation underpins the success of
norm development]{.underline}. Furthermore, the potential impact of
actions taken outside of cyberspace must be taken into account as they
did lead to the cyber accord and at least the temporary cessation of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) offending activity in cyber-
space.\[10\] These are critical considerations for the US cybersecurity
team as they develop US cyber policy: ideally, one directed towards a
robust US-led multilateral, whole-of-government approach to the
development of norms in cyberspace.

## Offensive cyber operations 

### Squo -- NATO lacks offensive cyber 

#### Uniqueness -- NATO lacks coordination on offensive cyber capabilities

[NATO allies have made slow but steady progress when it comes to
crafting policy to deal with cyber security challenges. Yet this
progress has not always been made in a collaborative fashion. Especially
when it comes to the development and deployment of offensive cyber
capabilities, NATO allies are increasingly diverging in
policy]{.underline}. This is a worrying development and deserves more
attention than it has so far received.

### Squo -- lack of transparency offensive cyber capabilities 

#### Lack of transparency and clear definition of offensive cyber weapons risks inadvertent escalation of cyber conflicts and prevents effective negotiations

[Conflict between states has taken on new forms, and cyber operations
play a leading role in this increasingly volatile environment, earning
them a top spot among states' most critical security
concerns.]{.underline} According to the Council on Foreign Relations,
[34 states are suspected of sponsoring cyber operations since
2005.]{.underline}1 [Despite the high level of activity, relatively
little is publicly known about the offensive cyber capabilities of
states]{.underline}. This is despite the widely held concern in
diplomatic circles that tensions in cyberspace are escalating, and the
[likelihood of a catastrophic cyber exchange between nation states
continues to rise. Such a calamity could well happen by
accident]{.underline}. [Avoiding "inadvertent escalation]{.underline}"
-- or accidental war -- [remains the most significant challenge between
states in]{.underline} [cyberspace]{.underline}. A [major contribution
to this uncertainty is the lack of transparency of offensive cyber
capabilities.]{.underline} Unlike other military systems, they are
[largely treated as dark secrets from the espionage world]{.underline}.
Traditional arms control efforts have depended upon the ability to count
weapon systems, like tanks and missiles, to regulate their deployment.
But there is [no common understanding of what "cyber weapons" are, or
indeed even "cyber forces".]{.underline} [States are left guessing as to
the overall capability of another state]{.underline} (albeit at widely
varying degrees of detail) without, for the most part, being able to
detail the exact order of battle, table of equipment, tactics,
techniques, procedures or other basic information -- unless the
intelligence assessment is very complete.2 [This secrecy has
implications not only for intelligence and national security
assessments, but more so for both the institutional dialogues and the
wider public discussion]{.underline} on international peace and security
in [cyberspace, by foreclosing any common language on offensive cyber
capabilities and intent.]{.underline} [Because of the lack of
transparency, intergovernmental, track 1 and track 2 discussions often
lack any basis for common exchange]{.underline}. [It frustrates
meaningful progress for predictability, confidence-building
measure]{.underline}s (e.g. within regional organisations such as ASEAN
and the OSCE), [norms of responsible state behaviour]{.underline} (e.g.
within the United Nations), and other stability measures. The lack of
transparency also impacts and limits the wider public discussion: the
general absence of information means that much of the public, media, and
academic discussion is not in sync with reality and risks becoming
irrelevant.

### Squo -- lack of focus on offensive capabilities 

#### Limited investment in offensive cyber -- need more focus

\*CD = cyberdefense

\*CS = cybersecurity

\*ICT = information communication technology

[To implement effective CS and CD, the proper cyber capabilities are
needed; that is to say, a combination of personnel, technologies and
organisational attributes]{.underline}. From the collected data, we
found that states are building cyber capabilities primarily by investing
in technology and knowledge. It is very positive that most states have
an integrated in-house education system, while at the same time using
training and exercises within NATO and the EU. Such a combination of
knowledge acquisition is particularly important in terms of exchanging
good practices and testing interoperability at national and
international levels.

It is also positive that most states use outsourcing and (commercial)
think tank/laboratory organisations, but less than half of the states
have a competency certification system in place[. Some do not have
offensive cyber capabilities or do not even intend to build them.
Possession of offensive cyber capabilities does not affect the state\'s
posture or does not mean that the state\'s posture is
offensive]{.underline}. Offensive cyber capabilities allow the state to
actively defend itself, while at the same time allowing it to better
understand the attacker. [The same is true in all other components of
the military as states not only develop defence capabilities but are
also offensive and they also train offensively]{.underline}, which does
not mean that they will unnecessarily act offensively or pose a threat
to international peace. Cyberspace, as one of the operational domains or
as a cross-domain, is no different and so the same approach to ensuring
national security is needed. [Building cyber capabilities by upgrading
ICT alone is not enough for effective CD. It is also necessary to build
offensive cyber capabilities that will allow states to develop, among
other things, tactical and technical procedures of CD that will stop an
attacker from carrying out a cyber attack or operation.]{.underline}
[Therefore, it is not a question of whether an offensive cyber
capability is needed, but how big and how trained it should be or, as
Limnéll said, 'cyber capabilities are essential for the nation-states
and the armed forces that wish to be treated as credible
actors']{.underline}. 134

#### Offensive cybersecurity -- NATO needs development

The [third factor is about the consideration of offensive
cybersecurity]{.underline}. NATO acknowledges [Article 5 a potential
cyber-attack trigger.]{.underline} [The doctrine and crisis management
requirements are established in the cyber policy of NATO, however, the
emphasis is only on a defensive stance.]{.underline} As such, cyber is
not regarded by the Alliance as a power generator that may be of value
to member states of NATO's defence; as mentioned above, the integration
of NATO and cybersecurity was only in 2008. In 2016 it was considered as
an important domain; as of now, it was not considered to be important.
[On the contrary, Russia views aggressive cyber capability as an
important part of its military strength and, in particular, as a way of
compensating for its relative lack of conventional forces compared to
NATO]{.underline}. [The growth of networking]{.underline}, the
proliferation of smartphones, cloud computing, the development of
software[, and other technical developments open new opportunities for
attackers and compel defenders to protect a rising range of
fields]{.underline}. The [defensive strategy of NATO is not
viable]{.underline} in the long term. [There are valuable cyber
capabilities worth attaining, including the ability to conduct
reconnaissance and surveillance, intercept communications, or deny
resources and access]{.underline}.9

### Squo -- US Cyber Command unilateral shift 

#### Uniqueness - US Cyber Command shift in policy to superiority through persistence -- alters the scope of US military actions

Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

The 2018 U.S. Cyber Command vision and the Department of Defense Cyber
Strategy embody a fundamental reorientation in strategic thinking.i
Based on the recognition that adversarial behavior below the threshold
of armed attack could nevertheless be strategically meaningful, [U.S.
Cyber Command seeks to achieve "superiority through persistence", that
is constantly engaging with the adversary - wherever they
maneuver]{.underline}.ii

[Much has already been written about the implications of U.S. doctrinal
change]{.underline}. The strategic shift has, in particular, led to
numerous critical remarks about the risks of escalation between the U.S.
and its main adversaries in cyberspace.iii Early on, Healey voiced
concern that the change in strategy would trigger the "new forever war
in cyberspace".iv In a more recent article, Healey analyzes the implied
causal chain of "persistent-engagement stability theory," and addresses
how certain feedback loops could potentially amplify or dampen cyber
conflict.v Others have argued that persistent engagement deepens the
cyber security dilemma - especially between the U.S. and China.vi

[The degree to which persistent engagement can help with the
establishment of cyber norms has opened a second line of
debate.]{.underline} According to some proponents, [persistent
engagement is a form of norms setting through practice,]{.underline}
leading to a "comprehensive strategic great power competitive space with
its own distinct structural features."vii Others are less positive that
the strategy can create a new normative area of competition - especially
if it is not combined with other elements of competitions in the
economic, diplomatic, informational and military spheres.viii

In addition, the shift in U.S. strategy together with a set of notable
legal changes - particularly to the authorisation and oversight
architecture - has led scholars and practitioners to write more
prolifically about U.S. legal underpinnings of out-of-network
operations.ix As a workshop report on military cyber operations
clarifies, [three changes are most prominent]{.underline}: "Firstly,
[the changes confirmed that the \[DoD\] has authority to operate in the
cyber domain outside of the context of defending its own
networks]{.underline}. Secondly, they clarified when the [executive can
decide on the undertaking of operations outside US territory without
Congressional authorisatio]{.underline}n. \[...\] Thirdly, [Congress
explicitly articulated that the activity conducted by U.S. Cyber Command
does not constitute "covert action]{.underline}" as defined by US
domestic law."x Overall[, scholars have concluded that U.S. Cyber
Command can now operate more swiftly as it is no longer required to
undertake the interagency process as before]{.underline}.xi

#### US strategy of persistent engagement and defend forward promotes stronger defense across alliance

**\*the strategy refers to US Cyber Command shift to persistent
engagement**

[Less systematic attention,]{.underline} however, has been [devoted to
the strategy's implications for the alliance and intelligence
collection.]{.underline} The purpose of this paper is to conduct a
benefit-risk assessment of the US strategy on this issue.xii The
assessment of this article takes place in five steps. Section I notes
that, historically, [allied states operate in each other's systems or
networks in at least two ways: as an observer,]{.underline} gathering
intelligence on adversarial activity in others' networks; [and as a
passerby]{.underline}, transiting through allied systems and networks to
access a certain adversarial target. [It is argued that, with the change
in strategy, the U.S. now also seeks to be a disrupter, seeking to cause
friction for an adversary's operation within an ally's network or
system.]{.underline} Section II addresses the benefits of this activity
and efforts of the U.S. to more closely collaborate with allies in this
space. It suggests [US strategy of persistent engagement and defend
forward can promote a stronger defense as a whole - and for states with
limited cyber capability in particular]{.underline}.xiii Section III
subsequently discusses the four avenues of how the strategy could lead
to negative implications for the alliance: i) loss of trust due to
offensive cyber effects operations in allied systems or networks;
compromise of allied intelligence operations and capabilities; iii)
exploitability of the strategy by adversaries; and iv) the
implementation (and justification) of persistent engagement by other
countries. The final section concludes and provides a potential proposal
to move forward.

### Squo -- US divergent policy undermines cohesion 

#### National cyber policies developing, revealing disparities and differences in cyber capabilities and policies -- US persistent engagement policy created divergence in allies' cyber policies

Steady progress

[Member states agree on the critical need for a coherent cyber policy.
Almost all NATO allies have developed both a cyber security strategy and
a cyber defense strategy]{.underline}.1 Some states have published
updated versions over the years to reaffirm cyber security as an issue
of national security importance, to tweak institutional
responsibilities, or to articulate changes in the threat landscape. [In
addition, since 2018, most NATO allies have established a military cyber
organization (either a command or unit) with a mandate to conduct cyber
effect operations]{.underline} -- that is, cyber operations intended to
disrupt, deny, degrade and/or destroy.2 [There is also shared
recognition that international law applies in cyberspace]{.underline},
although allies have yet to spell out the legal procedures for operating
in this new "domain of warfare."

[These developments have been both reflected in, and aided by, policy
progress made at the inter-governmental level.]{.underline} At the
Prague Summit in 2002, NATO for the first time recognized that the
Alliance should "Strengthen our capabilities to defend against cyber
attacks."3 In 2008, at the Bucharest Summit, there was another milestone
development, when NATO adopted a "Policy on Cyber Defense," aiming to
"protect key information systems in accordance with their respective
responsibilities; share best practices; and provide a capability to
assist Allied nations, upon request, to counter a cyber attack."4 In the
same year, the Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence -- a NATO
accredited international research institution -- was established in
Tallinn, Estonia. In 2016, at the Warsaw Summit, cyberspace was
officially recognized as a "domain of operations" and allies made a
Cyber Defense Pledge to enhance their cyber defenses.5 The 2018 Brussels
Summit and 2020 London Summit reiterated NATO's commitment to implement
the Cyber Defense Pledge and operationalize the Cyber Operations Center,
responsible for situational awareness and the centralized planning of
cyber operations and missions.6 In January 2020, the Allied Joint
Doctrine for Cyberspace Operations was published "to plan, execute and
assess cyberspace operations (CO) in the context of allied joint
operations."7

Steady divergence

[Yet when it comes to the direction of allies' cyber policy, growing
differences are apparent -- especially in the development and deployment
offensive cyber capabilities.]{.underline} First, even though most
states now have -- or are in the process of -- establishing a cyber
command, [operational capabilities vastly differ across
states.]{.underline}

[Whereas some governments are increasingly allocating significant
resources to conduct cyber operations]{.underline} -- and are now
starting to benefit from these investments -- [the majority of allies
still run their cyber commands]{.underline} on a budget of a few million
a year --an [amount that is insufficient for effective
operations]{.underline} in the cyber domain.

Secondly, [until a few years ago, NATO members' strategic visions were
largely aligned. National cyber strategies shared a common threat focus
on operations that could potentially cause major societal havoc, such as
taking down the power grid.]{.underline} Allies' national strategies
were also largely unified in their vision to address this threat,
discussing the need for deterrence, resilience, and norms. However,
[this changed with the publication of the US Department of Defense's
strategy on Defend Forward and US Cyber Command's vision on Persistent
Engagement]{.underline}.8 The [United States emphasizes the need to
cause friction]{.underline} "[wherever the adversary
maneuvers]{.underline}," [operating]{.underline} "globally, continuously
and seamlessly" (potentially) [below the threshold of armed
attack.]{.underline} "We must...maneuver seamlessly across the
interconnected battlespace, globally, as close as possible to
adversaries and their operations, and continuously shape the battlespace
to create operational advantage for us while denying the same to our
adversaries," in the words of NSA director and Cyber Command head Gen.
Paul Nakasone.9 **[Whereas deterrence is about changing your adversary's
cost-benefit calculus, Persistent Engagement is about taking the
opportunity away from the adversary to act.10]{.underline}**

Third, NATO member positions on how international law applies --
particularly the obligations of states vis-a-vis sovereignty -- are now
more divergent than a decade ago. Whereas countries like the Netherlands
and France are located on the side of the "sovereignty as a rule" camp,
the United Kingdom has taken the position that a remote cyber operation
by one state into another's cyber systems or network does not violate
the latter's sovereignty.

NATO's adversaries in the cyber domain

[Warfare in the cyber domain is already conducted against NATO member
states by both state and nonstate actors. It is also conducted by NATO
member states against these external threats.]{.underline} Within the
Alliance, however, [**offensive cyber effects are not yet part of the
mission planning process and integration of national offensive cyber
capabilities into joint NATO operations is voluntary.** Integrating
these national offensive cyber capabilities into NATO operations, thus
requires, not only a clear understanding of these capabilities, but also
agreement on the cyber threat environment,]{.underline} characterized by
the intent and capabilities of NATO's current and/or potential future
adversaries. [State adversaries in the cyber domain include Russia,
China and/or Iran.]{.underline} [These are countries known to be
building offensive cyber capabilities specifically for the purpose of
using them against NATO memberstates]{.underline}.7 [In Russia's case,
cyber attacks were conducted against the critical infrastructure of NATO
member states and partner nations]{.underline}, as for example against
US energy infrastructure in 2017 (including against a nuclear powerplant
near Burlington, Kansas)8 or against the Ukraine power grid in December
2015. [China has also been conducting persistent cyber espionage using
offensive cyber capabilities against core military and critical
infrastructure of NATO member states for years]{.underline}. For this
reason, the US Secretary of Defense, Mark T. Esper, remarked at the 2020
Munich Security Conference that the 5G Huawei infrastructure is a
serious threat to NATO.9 Lastly, [Iran's offensive cyber capabilities
have also been observed during multiple attacks against the critical
infrastructure of NATO partner nations in the Middle East. NATO
adversaries]{.underline} in the cyber domain also [include non-state
actors]{.underline}, such as terrorist organizations. [The US and the UK
have conducted several successful offensive cyber operations against
those entities]{.underline}. [These offensive cyber operations had a
significant force multiplier effect, in conjunction with conventional
actions on the ground, at sea, in the air and from space, that
contributed to the defeat of Daesh in both Iraq and
Syria.]{.underline}10 Today, [most Allies are building offensive cyber
capabilities needed to deny adversaries the freedom of maneuver in the
cyber domain.]{.underline}

At the [2016]{.underline} NATO Summit in Warsaw, [cyberspace was
recognized as an operational domain in which NATO military forces must
be able to maneuver as effectively as they do on land, at sea and in the
air.]{.underline} Since then[, Allies have conducted several successful
offensive cyber operations1 against non-state adversaries,]{.underline}
such as Daesh. Due to technological transformations in recent years[,
cyber is no longer viewed by NATO and its member states only as a hybrid
threat, but also as a weapon in its own right and as a force multiplier2
in current military operations]{.underline}. Over the next two decades,
[NATO will look for new ways to integrate cyber weapons (or offensive
cyber capabilities) into its operations and missions.3]{.underline}

This Policy Brief looks at the distinctions between cyber as a hybrid
threat and cyber as a weapon, from theoretical, policy and practice
perspectives, and proposes new ways in which NATO can integrate
offensive cyber capabilities into its operations.

The use of area denial weapon systems in the cyber domain

Anti-Access/Area Denial ([A2/AD) weapon systems have traditionally been
used by NATO and its member states to prevent an adversary's freedom of
maneuver on land, sea or air]{.underline}. In the geographic domains,
these capabilities include land mines, missiles (cruise, ballistic,
surface to air, anti-ship, etc.), submarines, electronic warfare, and
even Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive (CBRNE)
weapons. [In the cyber domain A2/AD is achieved through offensive cyber
operations]{.underline}. [Those operations have already been used for
the purpose of achieving A2/AD by NATO member states in the cyber
domain.]{.underline} This is the case of the US-led Operation Glowing
Symphony (OGS), where "the United States Cyber Command reportedly
acquired administrator passwords to \[Daesh\] websites.

The passwords enabled deletion of digital content, including videos used
for recruitment, from cyber infrastructure located in at least five
countries outside actively hostile areas of Iraq and Syria. Similar
digital content reportedly resided on cyber infrastructure in as many as
30 other States. Changing the passwords reportedly locked IS
administrators out of the websites".11 OGS restricted Daesh's freedom of
maneuver on networks physically residing in Iraq and Syria (which were
controlled by the terrorist group), but also worldwide, where a NATO
member state (the US) achieved denial of service effects against Daesh.
OGS disrupted Daesh propaganda through content removal from servers
residing in multiple countries and through restricting access to
physical infrastructure needed to store digital data. [Combined with
operational successes against ISIL on the ground, OGS actions resulted
in propaganda efforts being significantly reduced on several global
social media platforms, including Twitte]{.underline}r. [One particular
offensive cyber operation acted, ipso facto, as an A2/AD platform where
a NATO member state restricted access to physical networks critical for
Daesh recruitment, training, radicalization, fundraising, and command
and control.]{.underline}

Integrating offensive cyber capabilities into NATO's mandate for cyber
deterrence and defence

[Operationalizing warfighting capabilities in the cyber domain, beyond
the traditional geographic domains, requires a new way of fighting in
the 21st century, challenging the deterrence and defence mandate of the
Alliance.]{.underline} Speaking at the Cyber Defence Pledge Conference
in London in May 2019, NATO Secretary General highlighted that for
[deterrence to have full effect against state and non-state adversaries,
NATO and its member states must be ready to use the full range of
capabilities at their disposal, to include national offensive cyber
capabilities]{.underline}. [Deterrence is the act of diminishing an
adversary's intent by highlighting the excessive costs for the said
adversary if it proceeds with an undesired action.]{.underline} In
NATO's case, [deterrence is achieved by highlighting to an adversary the
excessive costs delivered through military means]{.underline} in the
event of an attack against [Allies. For deterrence to be successful, the
adversary must believe that NATO is ready and willing to impose these
excessive costs across all operational domains, to include the cyber
domain.]{.underline} [This may call for Allies to develop offensive
cyber capabilities and integrate them with NATO operations in order to
collectively impose a high enough cost to deter adversaries from
aggressive behaviour]{.underline}. [To avoid escalation to total war and
cyber fratricide during the fog of war,]{.underline} [Allies must also
agree on a list of Flexible Deterrent Options]{.underline} meant to
allow for a gradual increase of pressure in the cyber domain, and then
hopefully limiting the scope and intensity of conflict in this domain.
NATO Flexible Deterrent Options in the cyber domain could include (as
presented in Figure 1):

• Increasing NATO's readiness posture through cyber education, training
and exercises;

• Deploying NATO Cyber Rapid Reaction teams to conduct defensive cyber
operations and protecting critical infrastructure of NATO member states
and/or that NATO operations rely upon;

• Increasing public awareness of malicious cyber activities and the
potential for conflict in the cyber domain;

• Taking steps to gain the support of all NATO member states in response
to the cyber threat and in accordance with commitments of the 2016 Cyber
Defence Pledge and the 2018 Brussels Summit;

• Triggering Article 4 of the Treaty to enhance information-sharing and
mutual assistance in the cyber domain;

• Making official statements addressing violations of international law
in the cyber domain;

• Alerting and deploying offensive cyber operations forces;

• Imposing cyber sanctions;12

• Conducting offensive cyber operations to achieve A2/AD effects in the
cyber domain;

• Triggering Article 5 of the Treaty; and

• Conducting offensive cyber operations in combination with other
maneuver forces across all operational domains.

Conclusion

[The lack of integrated offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities undermines
both the unity of the Alliance and its mandate of defence and
deterrence]{.underline}. On the former, [the lack of coordination
between Allies during unilateral cyber operations could lead to
friction]{.underline} when resulting effects infringe on Allied
cyber-physical infrastructures. It [could also lead to cyber
fratricide]{.underline}, [when failure to properly attribute Allied
digital personas occurs during these military operations]{.underline}.
On the latter, [while most Allies are developing offensive cyber
capabilities, some remain unable to face the growing number of cyber
threats unilaterally.]{.underline}

[Successful defence and deterrence in the cyber domain calls, thus, for
ready collective offensive cyber A2/AD capabilities that, when
integrated with NATO operations, would complement national and/ or
regional responses to malicious cyber activities]{.underline}. If and
when this integration occurs, NATO Flexible Deterrence Options would
also need to be agreed upon in order to signal cyber adversaries that
Allies will respond with one voice if attacked in the cyber domain.
[Ultimately, political consensus within the Alliance would still need to
be built on the type of needed collective offensive cyber capabilities
(such as for A2/ AD purposes) and on how to integrate them into NATO's
existing operations and missions.]{.underline}

### Solvency - Persistent engagement -- solves red and grey spaces

#### US Cyber command policies focus on red space and grey space for persistence engagement

Out of Network Operations in allied systems or networks

The purpose of this section is to review the nature of U.S. Cyber
Command's out of network operations. The first part talks about the
understanding of territoriality and cyber operations. The second part
discusses three types of out of network operations in allied networks.

Following its change in strategy, [U.S. Cyber Command seeks to operate
"seamlessly, globally and continuously.]{.underline}"xiv In the U.S.
Cyber Command vision it is [stated that "\[s\]uperiority through
persistence seizes and maintains the initiative in cyberspace by
continuously engaging and contesting adversaries and causing them
uncertainty wherever they maneuver]{.underline}."xv In an article for
Joint Force Quarterly, NSA Director and Cyber Command head Gen. General
Nakasone writes: "[If we are only defending in "blue space," we have
failed]{.underline}. [We must instead maneuver seamlessly across the
interconnected battlespace, globally,]{.underline} as close as possible
to adversaries and their operations, [and continuously shape the
battlespace to create operational advantage]{.underline} for us while
denying the same to our adversaries"xvi

["As close as possible" means that the US seeks to achieve effects i)
outside of its own networks, and ii) beyond adversaries
networks.]{.underline} [This vast area is not ungoverned
space]{.underline}. We are talking here about routers in Nairobi,
servers in the Denmark, or operating infrastructure in other countries.
As Seymour Goodman put it "cyberspace always touches ground
somewhere".xvii

Yet, U.S Cyber Command's use of terminology - as well as talk about
"operating close to the adversary" - evades one issue: It is unclear
whether Cyber Command only seeks to cause friction in "red space" or if
it seeks to compete in "gray space" as well. These terms are often
confused and not well- understood. In fact, the issue was raised for
"further exploration" at Cyber Command's 2018 symposium, specifically
understanding the "relevance of concepts like area of responsibility and
red- blue-gray space to the cyberspace domain."xviii Joint Publication
3-12 (JP 3-12) on cyberspace operations, prepared under the direction of
the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, explains the terminology:

The term "[blue cyberspace" denotes areas in cyberspace protected by the
US, its mission partners, and other areas DOD may be ordered to
protect]{.underline}. \[...\] The [term "red cyberspace" refers to those
portions of cyberspace owned or controlled by an adversary or
enemy]{.underline}. In this case, "controlled" means more than simply
"having a presence on," since threats may have clandestine access to
elements of global cyberspace where their presence is undetected and
without apparent impact to the operation of the system. Here, controlled
means the ability to direct the operations of a link or node of
cyberspace, to the exclusion of others[. All cyberspace that does not
meet the description of either "blue" or "red" is referred to as "gray"
cyberspace]{.underline}.xix

[Gray space is defined based on the 'nodes' adversaries control. This
means the vast area between U.S. government-owned networks and
adversaries is not considered to be gray space.]{.underline} Instead, if
for instance the GRU (Russia's military intelligence agency) controls a
node in the Netherlands, it is considered to be red space based on JP
3-12.xx And it is worth mentioning that the notion of control is open to
interpretation by states.

[This means that if U.S. Cyber Command seeks to operate only in "red
space," its activities will still have global reach.]{.underline} It
also [suggests that red space grows as adversaries expand their
operational activity]{.underline}. Most importantly[, this implies that
if U.S. Cyber Command seeks to achieve "effects" in gray
space]{.underline}, this will involve operating infrastructure that
adversaries do not control---which is to say those systems or networks
on which adversaries merely have a presence or are not active at all.

### AT: US unilat CP/Squo solves 

#### US unilateral persistent engagement and defend forward undermines trust and causes friction when allies don't want US to operate in allies' space 

**Smeets,** ETH Zurich, Center for Security Studies, **2020**

\[Max "U.S. Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement & Defend Forward:
Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

Risks for Allies and Intelligence Collection

This section addresses [four connected risks associated with US
strategy. The first risk is perhaps the most obvious: if U.S. Cyber
Command directly operates in allied networks without consent, it creates
friction by allies undermining trust.]{.underline} Operating instantly
makes sense considering the potential operational tempo of adversaries:
You cannot have protracted diplomatic discussions for two months with an
ally about whether or not to take down some command and control
infrastructure of an adversary hosted in the allied country. You don't
have days, let alone months. As a participant mentioned at the 2019
Cyber Command Symposium on strategy: "Opportunities within this domain
are fleeting."xxxviii

[Operating seamlessly could also make sense if an ally does not mind the
U.S. coming into its networks to address the malicious
activity]{.underline}. In this vein, [the U.S. can continue to build
partnerships with countries that do not have the capacity to defend
against cyber attacks on their own]{.underline}, as described above.
[But, what if an allied country is not keen on having the U.S. military
in its networks, actively, seamlessly, and continuously disrupting an
adversary's cyber operations? As the German case shows, this scenario
will likely come up a lot more in the near future.]{.underline}

#### US unilateral action undermines data collection and ongoing intelligence efforts of allies, altering TTP strategies mid-stream 

**Smeets,** ETH Zurich, Center for Security Studies, **2020**

\[Max "U.S. Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement & Defend Forward:
Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

Second, [it is not just about cyber effect operations taking place in
systems or networks in allied territory.]{.underline} [There could also
be a negative impact on allied intelligence operations and capabilities
beyond these systems and networks]{.underline}. The U.S Cyber Command -
and other military cyber organizations - are operating in a global
environment historically dominated by intelligence agencies, and the
Five Eyes has always been the most dominant actor in cyberspace.xxxix
But [the anglophone intelligence alliance is not the only intelligence
actor operating across the world]{.underline}. Recent cases---such as
the infiltration of the Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service
into the Russia-based network of the infamous hacking group Cozy
Bear---have illustrated the continued global prevalence and value of
allies' intelligence operations beyond the Five Eyes alliance.xl [If
U.S. Cyber Command increasingly take up the role of 'disrupter' it may
negatively impact global intelligence collection of
allies]{.underline}---[particularly those countries that favor long-term
access over immediate effect. It will also more likely uncover and burn
allied capabilities.]{.underline}

[The risks of occurring are higher than one may think as intelligence
agencies have a tendency and incentive to target and track the same
entities]{.underline}. For example, in late 2014, cybersecurity company
Kaspersky Lab reported on the so-called \"Magnet of Threats". The
cybersecurity company discovered a server belonging to a research
organization in the Middle East that simultaneously hosted implants for
at least five Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors: Regin and the
Equation Group, Turla and ItaDuke, Animal Farm, and Careto.xli All of
these APTs have been associated with prominent national security and
intelligence agencies. Equation group and Regin are connected to the
Five-Eyes. As said, Animal Farm has been attributed to France\'s
external intelligence agency. Turla Group has been associated with the
Russian federal security service (FSB). ItaDuke is said to be linked to
the Russian government too. Finally, it is theorized that Spain is
behind Careto, also known as 'The Mask'.

[Consider what would have happened if one of those five APT groups had
sought to cause a disruptive effect - rather than collect intelligence -
against the target in the Middle East. It likely would have resulted in
much earlier discovery and analysis by threat intelligence
companies]{.underline} (or other actors) [exposing the tactics,
techniques and procedures (TTPs) of each actor group.]{.underline}

Also, [even the anticipation of more cyber effect operations in
non-allied networks from one allied state could lead to a change in
operations by another state]{.underline}. Indeed, [states have shown in
the past that the anticipation of early discovery of an operation has
led to a change in their TTPs]{.underline}. For example, the National
Security Agency (NSA) created an \"exploit orchestrator\" called
FoxAcid, an internet-enabled system capable of attacking target
computers in a variety of different ways, depending on whether it is
discovered---or likely to be discovered---in a given network.xlii
FoxAcid has a modular design, with flexibility allowing the NSA to swap
and replace exploits and run different exploits based on various
considerations. Against technically sophisticated targets where the
chance of detection is high, FoxAcid would normally choose to run
low-value exploits.

#### Russia exploit frictions with allies that result from US unilateral actions that allies do not want to occur in their spaces -

Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

Third, [allied friction could potentially be exploited by
adversaries]{.underline}. Adversaries do not randomly choose which
intermediate nodes to direct their operations through. If Russia has the
choice to go through a network that would raise some serious diplomatic
friction between the U.S. and a U.S. ally, or operate through a network
that would cause no diplomatic friction for the U.S., what would it
prefer?

[It would make sense for adversaries to operate through the networks of
exactly those countries with which the U.S. has a strong relationship
but that do not want the U.S. to operate within their networks causing
any effects]{.underline}. [Russia is already good at exploiting
divisions between the U.S. and its allies. Cyber Command's new strategy
might give it another avenue to do so.]{.underline}

Fourth[, whilst allies can integrate their cyber efforts into U.S.
strategy of persistent engagement, if allies would adopt their own
strategy of persistent engagement - mirroring U.S. current doctrine and
practice]{.underline}

\- [it would likely further undermine the alliance
relationships]{.underline}. [If US strategy of persistent engagement
leads allies to adopt their own strategy of persistent engagement, it
would mean allies also seek "superiority in cyberspace"; "continuously
engaging and contesting adversaries and causing them uncertainty
wherever they maneuver]{.underline}"; and operating "seamlessly,
globally and continuously" - as stated in the Cyber Command vision. More
specifically, it would mean that allies seek to swiftly achieve effects
in systems and networks that are potentially located on U.S. territory,
without necessarily notifying the U.S. government before. In other
words[, it means that networks and systems turn into red space and gray
space for allies]{.underline} - like allied networks are now gray and
red space for the U.S. to actively disrupt and degrade adversarial
operations.

It is unlikely that the U.S. government would react positively if
Germany, or any other allied country for that matter, hacks into a
server hosting Russian propaganda that was located in the United States,
with some form of notification but without Pentagon's consent.[xliii
There are numerous reasons why the US government would be upset with
this type of behavior.]{.underline} It would likely be seen as reckless
from Germany - especially if the US was already on those same networks
for intelligence collection purposes.

[An important dimension of this scenario is derived from the fact that
the U.S. is a vast target rich environment, potentially even prioritized
as a target by adversaries such as China, Russia, North Korea, Iran - as
well as non-state actors]{.underline}. As stated above, red space and
gray space are defined, according to U.S. Joint Publication 3-12 on
Cyberspace Operations, based on what "nodes" adversaries "control".
There are many nodes adversaries (of US allies) want to control in the
US. In other words, [if US allies would seek to swiftly disrupt and
degrade cyber operations in red space and gray space on a
constant-basis, much of that would be in the United States.]{.underline}

### AT no consensus amongst allies of offensive capabilities

#### Process of integration of offensive capabilities into exercises for deterrence can occur as part of process of consensus building on offensive cyber capabilities

Next Steps: Addressing Challenges and Mitigating Risks

[Given the threat environment facing NATO]{.underline}, as well as the
activities of several NATO members, [the alliance should
deliberately---but purposefully---consider incorporating offensive cyber
operations below the level of armed conflict into its deterrence
strategy.]{.underline} Any effort to explore a role for offensive cyber
operations should also consider the challenges and risks that may come
with doing so. A central challenge is that, at the political level[,
NATO allies lack consensus on the appropriate application of offensive
cyber power---especially below the level of armed conflict. Addressing
these disagreements among member states is essential because conducting
offensive cyber operations]{.underline} [often requires maneuvering
through or operating on networks]{.underline} [controlled by an ally or
allies]{.underline}. Right now, NATO members do not collectively agree
on the protocols and processes for partner actions in allied
networks---and they also disagree on how to define sovereignty in
cyberspace, or when an offensive cyber operation would rise to the level
of an armed attack.

[Offensive cyber operations for NATO also present real interoperability
challenges.]{.underline} The role of intelligence in cyber operations is
likely to complicate NATO planning processes. Even close allies are
likely to be wary about sharing sensitive intelligence for a number of
reasons. For instance, they may be averse to sharing information gleaned
from signals intelligence collection or because a member state may be
using the same exploits for both offensive action and their own
espionage---including intelligence collection against allies. Or, allies
may simply be worried that sensitive information may become exposed. On
top of this, [it's challenging to adjudicate intelligence requirements
among allies and to deconflict intelligence and military
priorities]{.underline}. It is also not clear whether the alliance has
established consensus thresholds that specify the conditions and
timeline under which a state would have to notify others of its
activities on their networks---if at all.

[The alliance should account for, and address, these issues as NATO
explores the prospect of incorporating offensive cyber operations below
the level of armed conflict into existing NATO simulations and exercises
that span the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.]{.underline}
A number of important questions about how to coordinate offensive cyber
operations and define roles and responsibilities remain unanswered. For
instance, how could allies improve intelligence sharing to conduct more
rapid attribution, enabling one state or the alliance to respond to
adversary cyber activity? What are the conditions under which allies
should consider dividing responsibilities for cyber campaign planning
and developing accesses and capabilities against strategic targets in,
for example, Russia? If some allies are responsible for offensive cyber
operations against certain targets, what are the information-sharing and
notification requirements?

### AT offensive cyber causes escalation

#### No evidence of escalation from offensives cyber -- studies prove 

**Lonergan** , assistant professor in the Army Cyber Institute at West
Point and research scholar at the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace
Studies at Columbia University **and Montgomery**, senior director of
the Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation at the Foundation for
Defense of Democracies, **2022**

Finally[, there is an obvious risk that moving toward a more offensive
posture in cyberspace will increase the likelihood of
escalation]{.underline}. **[While these concerns should not be ignored,
academic research has found little support for the argument that cyber
operations cause escalation]{.underline}**. That said, [the alliance
should consider how to strengthen existing confidence-building
measures]{.underline}, particularly with Russia, to enable more
effective communication and transparency about cyber operations. The
expert consultations between Russia and the United States that both
governments agreed to in June 2021, for example, or recent diplomatic
dialogue between Russia and NATO members over the Ukraine crisis, are
important to strengthen processes for crisis management and reduce the
risk of instability---including that which may stem from cyber
operations.

[NATO has slowly begun to address the use of offensive cyber operations,
and has generally limited itself to the use of these tools in
traditional military campaigns. The ongoing crisis with Russia on
Ukraine's border is exposing the risk in this approach. NATO needs to
figure out a way forward fast.]{.underline}

### Squo -- US Cyber command unilateral actions -- international law risk

#### US Cyber Command shifts role of the military to active disrupter -- and may run afoul of international law 

**Smeets,** ETH Zurich, Center for Security Studies, **2020**

\[Max "U.S. Cyber Strategy of Persistent Engagement & Defend Forward:
Implications for the Alliance and Intelligence Collection" [Intelligence
and National Security]{.underline} vol 35, 2020 -- Issue 3, Taylor and
Francis Online accessed 7/5/2022 GDI-TM\]

What is really new here? The United States has long operated in networks
"close to the adversary." As Ben Buchanan's book, "The Cybersecurity
Dilemma," demonstrates, the U.S. has long acted as an observer outside
of its own networks, gathering intelligence of adversarial activity in
those others' networks.xxi In fact, information has become public
concerning a case in which the Five Eyes collected intelligence about an
espionage platform (dubbed "Snowglobe" by the Canadian Intelligence
Agency CSEC and "Animal Farm" by Kaspersky Lab) of an allied country,
France, likely operating in adversarial networks in the Middle East.xxii
In other words, the practice of fourth-party collection is nothing
new.xxiii Furthermore, the U.S. has long acted in foreign
non-adversarial networks as a passerby, transiting through allied'
networks to access an adversarial network.

Yet, [the new Cyber Command and Defense Department strategy changes the
nature of the U.S. military's behavior within those systems and
networks.]{.underline} Under the new strategy, [Cyber Command wants to
be an active disrupter on those networks]{.underline}. [It wants to
achieve effects - that is to disrupt, deny, degrade, and/or
destroy.]{.underline} The only known precedent is U.S. Cyber Command
operators wiping Islamic State propaganda material off a server located
in Germany.xxiv The German government was notified in some fashion but
not asked for advance consent, causing much frustration.xxv This will
likely lead to a systematic scaling up: [U.S. Cyber Command now also
seeks to be an active disrupter on those networks "globally,
continuously and seamlessly"---not regionally and
sporadically]{.underline}.xxvi

Out of network operations in allied networks also affect the turf war
between the NSA and Cyber Command - mostly critically Title 10 and Title
50 concerns.xxvii As Chesney summarizes:

From a legal perspective, the issue this \[case of Germany\] highlights
is that operations abroad implicate the UN Charter and related claims
about international law protection of sovereignty. \[...\] Intelligence
agencies can more easily act in this setting when operating under Title
50 authority, as covert action status carries with it a statutory
obligation to comply with the U.S. Constitution and U.S. statutes---but
no more than that. Title 10, in contrast, carries with it no such
implicit statutory shield against international law objections, and of
course there is a general Defense Department policy of international law
compliance. Thus CYBERCOM operating under Title 10 would run into the
full thicket of international law concerns.xxviii

[Overall, it is expected that operating in allied networks under Title
10 is likely to cause more legal friction than operating under Title
50.]{.underline}

## Personnel 

### US key -- educational framework 

#### New education programs modeled after US frameworks solve personnel gaps

NATO relies on its member nations to send qualified  personnel on
rotation, but NATO also has longer-serving  staff among its civilian
personnel. Whether employees have  served for three years or 30, [NATO
will want to ensure that  its cyber workforce has a baseline of skills
and]{.underline} knowledge  and develop progressive educational modules
to grow and  sustain its human capital. As already noted, the baseline 
will vary depending on the work roles and job series a  person occupies.
The U.S. Department of Defense [(DoD)  has developed a DoD Cyber
Workforce Framework that  encompasses four main categories of personnel:
cyberspace  IT, cybersecurity, cyberspace effects, and intelligence.55
NATO could also look to bring in expertise on short-term  assignments
similar to the U.S. Defense Digital Service.56 It could also develop
industry fellows programs to give its  permanent staff experience in the
private sector]{.underline}, similar to  the U.S. Secretary of Defense
Executive Fellows program.57 [These programs could inject new thinking
and bring valu able private-sector experience to bear.]{.underline}

[NATO's educational institutions will play a critical role  in
developing and sustaining the cyberspace workforce for  the alliance,
starting with instituting courses that cover  relevant
topics]{.underline}, from strategy and policy to more technical  areas.
[Some suggested topics to include in a first orienta tion course that
establishes the baseline]{.underline} (some of which are  already being
taught) [would include]{.underline}

[• NATO organizational structure and national-level  organizations that
interface with the alliance]{.underline}. This  would include covering
the roles and responsibilities  of the NCIRC, ACO Cyber Division, ACT
Cyber  Capabilities Branch, and the CyOC, as well as  national-level
cybercommands and EU institutions. 

• [strategic and operational planning]{.underline}, including how  cyber
operations fit into the COPD and the NATO  Crisis Management Process. 

• [technical topics for those less familiar with the layers  of the
cyber domain]{.underline}, from the physical infrastruc ture to the
virtual or "cyber persona" domain. 

• [cyberspace capabilities in the alliance and at the  national
level]{.underline}, including defensive capabilities.

• [the legal and policy frameworks for cyber oper ations]{.underline},
including the law of armed conflict and  its application to the cyber
domain, operational  authorities, and NATO declarations and policies.

### NATO needs personnel 

#### Skilled cybersecurity personnel and adaptation of NATO's educational programs key to address emerging cyberspace issues 

**Ablon et al, 2019**

\[Lillian, information scientist at the RAND Corporation and a professor
at the Pardee RAND Graduate School, \"Operationalizing Cyberspace as a
Military Domain\", RAND, 6/19/19,
https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/perspectives/PE300/PE329/RAND_PE329.pdf,
accessed 7/3/22, GDI-cc\]

[NATO will need staff officers, civilian personnel, and  other
augmentees who not only are steeped in the technical  aspects of
cyberspace but also understand how cyberspace  operations can contribute
to the overall success of NATO operations and how other domains can
reinforce the cyber  domain. NATO is starting to adapt its educational
curriculum to address the full array of cyberspace issues]{.underline}.
The  NATO Communications and Information Agency has built  a new school
in Portugal to support its mission and teach  staff about the operation
of NATO IT systems.53 [Other  academic institutions, such as the NATO
Defence College,  the NATO School Oberammergau, or the Cooperative 
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, should also implement  courses
focusing on cyberspace as a domain of operations.  ]{.underline}

[The competition for skilled cybersecurity personnel is  well
documented. The cybersecurity certification organization, (ISC)2, noted
in a recent report that the workforce  shortage of these professionals
is growing globally, reaching almost three million positions in
2018]{.underline}.54 Nearly half  of the surveyed organizations for that
report expected to  increase cybersecurity staffing in the next year,
underscoring that demand will grow, not diminish. [NATO undoubtedly will
be among those organizations competing in the  labor marketplace for
skilled cybersecurity professionals,  but as we have seen, it will
require more than technical  staff. It will need to educate its
leadership, both military  and civilian, in the technical, operational,
legal, and policy  topics of cyberspace.  ]{.underline}

[Officers and civilian personnel assigned to NATO  on rotations will
come with varied backgrounds and  experience for the positions they will
fill. Some positions,  such as in the cyber offices at Allied Command
Operations  (ACO), ACT, and the new CyOC will clearly need personnel who
have a deeper experience than the broader orga nization]{.underline},
something that will likely rely on personnel from  a subset of the
member nations for the near future, given  the wide variance in national
experience in cyberspace.  [But other parts of NATO will also need to
draw on cyber  expertise to ensure cyberspace integration into
operations,  including at the various operational
headquarters.]{.underline}

## Resiliency 

### Resiliency -- NATO coordination 

#### [Solvency]{.underline} -- incorporating safeguards into NATO to monitor allies' defense preparations and reduce reliance on non-allied energy and critical infrastructure reduces vulnerabilities and increases resilience

**Becker et al.**, affiliated with the Centre for Security, Diplomacy
and Strategy at the Vrije Universiteit Brussels, **2022**

(Jordan, academy professor and director of the Social Science Research
Lab at West Point academy, "DON'T LET RUSSIA DOMINATE THE STRATEGIC
CONCEPT," War on the Rocks, JUNE 28, 2022,
https://warontherocks.com/2022/06/dont-let-russia-dominate-the-strategic-concept/,
accessed 7/3/2022, gdi-tmur)

Although defending human and physical infrastructure from asymmetric
threats is inherently national business, [NATO]{.underline} itself [can
serve as a platform for coordinating allied responses to these
challenges]{.underline}. NATO allies agreed on seven baseline
requirements for national resilience at their 2016 Warsaw Summit. They
have also "improve\[d\] their cyber resilience by introducing capability
targets" into the NATO Defence Planning Process.

Recently, however, [national resilience has been challenged in
additional areas]{.underline}, which should be reflected. Specifically,
[NATO should address democratic backsliding]{.underline}, [election
interference]{.underline}, [and economic and information
manipulation]{.underline}. Specifically, [NATO's requirements for
national resilience should be upgraded to require national safeguards
against democratic backsliding]{.underline}. Prior to taking up her
position as the senior U.S. Department of Defense official in Europe,
Rachel [Ellehuus]{.underline} highlighted the vulnerabilities laid bare
by such backsliding and [argued]{.underline} that "[the trans-Atlantic
alliance will only remain strong if members genuinely abide by its
founding principles]{.underline}." [By incorporating]{.underline} such
[safeguards into NATO's systems for monitoring allies' defense
preparations]{.underline}, [allies can shape one another's political,
economic, and security incentives in ways that reduce these
vulnerabilities]{.underline}.

[Allies should]{.underline} also [agree to reduce dramatically their
reliance on non-allied energy]{.underline} --- the vulnerabilities
inherent in German dependence on Russian gas have been exposed during
the Russo-Ukrainian war. Progress toward independence cannot come fast
[enough]{.underline}. Finally, [non-allied ownership of critical
infrastructure, especially transportation and telecommunications, poses
risks that have not yet materialized in the same way as energy
dependency but are just as dangerous]{.underline}. The [risks should
be]{.underline} explicitly [addressed]{.underline} in the strategic
concept, [and concrete steps toward mitigation should increase
accordingly]{.underline}. [Military mobility remains a critical
infrastructural challenge that allies should also explicitly grapple
with in coordination with the]{.underline} [E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion. As [in]{.underline} the [cyber realm,]{.underline}
the [NATO Defence Planning Process may be an appropriate venue for these
efforts]{.underline}.

## Zero --trust architecture 

### Solves Russia 

#### Resilient cyber capabilities and effective security approaches like zero-trust policies produce effective cyber defense against Russia

**Kramer and Pavel, 2022**

\[Franklin, distinguished fellow and board director of the Atlantic
Council and Former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International
Security Affairs, and Barry, director of the Scowcroft Center for
Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, \"NATO priorities:
Initial lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war\", Atlantic Council,

accessed 7/3/22, GDI-cc\]

[In the event of a conflict with Russia, a successful defense will
depend heavily on resilient cybersecurity capabilities, in order to
maintain the operation of key critical infrastructures necessary to
defense mission assurance. Achieving that goal will require not only
government efforts, but also the establishment of an effective
coordination mechanism between governments and the private
sector]{.underline}, as the latter will be significantly engaged in the
cyber fight.

[Russia's substantial cyberwarfare against Ukraine underscores the
importance of such effective cybersecurity]{.underline}. As NATO's
assistant secretary general for intelligence has described:

[All available evidence indicates that Russia has employed a coordinated
cyber-campaign intended to provide its forces with an early advantage
during its war in Ukraine]{.underline}...\[T\]the magnitude of Moscow's
pre-kinetic destructive cyber-operations was unprecedented. [On the day
the invasion began, Russian cyber-units successfully deployed more
destructive malware---including against conventional military targets
such as civilian communications infrastructure and military command and
control centers---than the rest of the world's cyberpowers combined
typically use in a given year]{.underline}...The cumulative effects of
these attacks were striking. In the hours prior to invasion, Russia hit
a range of important targets in Ukraine, rendering the computer systems
of multiple government, military, and critical infrastructure sectors
inoperable."

[NATO needs to anticipate that in any conflict with Russia, it would
face the same types of cyberattacks. Maintenance of governmental
functions and reasonably adequate operation of critical infrastructures,
especially those necessary to defense mission assurance, would be
critical]{.underline}. Through the defense-planning process, [NATO
should set as a goal a cybersecurity plan that utilizes the most
effective cybersecurity approaches, namely a combination of zero-trust
architectures, advanced threat hunting, and continuous vulnerability
analysis.]{.underline}

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory has
described zero-trust (ZT) architectures:

[The core principles behind ZT are: 1) universal authentication of all
users]{.underline}, devices, and services; [2) access
segmentation]{.underline}, allowing no single entity access to more than
a small portion of the organization's resources; [3) minimal trust
authorization]{.underline}, keeping access to resources only to those
entities that "need-to-know" and can be trusted; [4)
encryption]{.underline} everywhere to protect information in flight and
at rest, whether inside or outside the organization's networks; [and 5)
continuous monitoring and adjustment to detect issues]{.underline} early
and adjust access accordingly."

CONCLUSION

Thus, [in conclusion, several member states fail to adopt and review
their national cyber- security policies, considering the promise at the
Warsaw NATO Summit. As a result, NATO\'s attempts to develop
alliance-wide cybersecurity are hampered by considerable national
contradictions, and NATO\'s collective cyberspace defence and deterrence
also reveal significant vulnerabilities against the background of a
rising amount of attacks]{.underline}. **[For NATO to operationalize
cyberspace as a sphere of NATO security policy and planning, the
Alliance should have permission from member states to do more than just
provide guidance, experience, training, or instruction]{.underline}.
[NATO should establish benchmarks and better metrics that allow a
consistent assessment]{.underline}** of the annual success of a country
and [should be charged annually with testing and assessing the skills of
members]{.underline}**. [Cooperation with the European Union is
necessary to meet this goal. NATO and the EU might work together to

### Perm -- cyber resiliency 

#### [Perm solves]{.underline} -- NATO-EU cooperation for EDTs solves - European digital defense shield and cyber training 

**Bonefeld-Dahl**, Director General of DIGITALEUROPE, **2022**

(Cecilia, "Preparing Europe for cyberwarfare," The Parliament Magazine,
March 28, 2022, lexis, accessed 6/28/2022, gdi-tmur)

\*ESET = a Slovak internet security company

It is no surprise therefore that [malicious cyber-attacks have
skyrocketed following]{.underline} the [Russian invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. ESET has identified several new strains of
malware, which they have called IsaacWiper and HermeticWizard, and they
have even found evidence that a cyberattack had preceded the start of
the Russian invasion of Ukraine by a few hours.

So how prepared are European governments today for a potential cyber or
military attack?

Unfortunately, numbers show that over the past few years, [there has
been little political will among European NATO members to contribute to
common defence efforts]{.underline}. The [US spends more than all of the
other]{.underline} 29 [NATO members combined]{.underline}. In 2020,
it\'s estimated that the US defence contribution reached over 3.7% of
GDP, while the average for NATO\'s European members (and Canada) was
stalling at 1.77% of GDP, below the 2% of GDP commitment made by all
defence ministers back in 2006.

[With the current devastating war underway in Ukraine and the imminent
Russian threats to the rest of Europe, European NATO leaders should
urgently increase funding to 3% and dedicate at least 1% of spending to
emerging and disruptive technologies]{.underline} (EDTs).

[EDTs such as artificial intelligence, quantum technology and robotics
are set to have a tremendous impact on cyber-defence and]{.underline} to
[revolutionise]{.underline} future [military strategies and
operations]{.underline}. [It is vital that]{.underline} the [EU and its
NATO allies stay at the forefront of technological
advances]{.underline}.

As NATO\'s Deputy Director General Mircea Geoana said at our Masters of
Digital event back in February:\' \"In the 70\'s, 80% of innovation was
produced by governments. Now the ratio has been reversed, today about
90% of security and defence innovation comes from the private sector.\"

As cyberwarfare is worryingly becoming more devastating, from political
destabilisation to wreaking havoc on energy infrastructure to
misinformation, [NATO and the EU need to urgently bolster their
cooperation to create a more resilient cybersecurity ecosystem based on
digital innovation]{.underline}.

Beyond the importance of political will and financial investment, [it is
equally vital to close the gap in the cybersecurity
workforce]{.underline}. According to the latest count, Europe\'s
shortage of cybersecurity professionals has increased, reaching over
200,000 needed specialists in 2021. In the context of a devastating
pandemic and a devasting war, [the need for more cybersecurity
professionals is expected to outpace available talent]{.underline}.

"EDTs such as artificial intelligence, quantum technology and robotics
are set to have a tremendous impact on cyber-defence and to
revolutionise future military strategies and operations\"

The [EU should redouble skilling efforts through existing
programmes]{.underline} [such as the Digital Europe Programme and
Horizon Europe]{.underline}. [Students and especially young girls and
women should be highly encouraged to pursue a career in this
field]{.underline} as disappointingly women make up only 20% of the
cybersecurity workforce.

Finally, [the EU and the US need to harness their collaboration on
cybersecurity through the EU-US Trade and Technology
Council]{.underline} (TTC). Today, more than ever, [regulatory alignment
on policies]{.underline} such as the Artificial Intelligence Act [is
of]{.underline} a [paramount importance]{.underline}. As part of our key
priorities recommendations for the upcoming TTC meeting, [we have called
on both allies to initiate a dialogue on mutual recognition of
cybersecurity certification regimes]{.underline}.

The [Russian invasion of Ukraine has been a wake-up call to all
political leaders that collective security should be taken seriously in
peace as much as in war]{.underline}. Today, [digital technologies are
not simply components of security systems;]{.underline} [they are at the
very heart]{.underline} of these systems. [We must ensure that digital
innovation is the cornerstone of any European defence
shield]{.underline}.

like the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the
State Department, as well as NATO systems, European government agencies,
and Fortune 500 companies.3 In 2017, NotPetya erased the capital assets
of hundreds of companies in minutes by encrypting and wiping their
information technology systems with damages so costly they impacted
national GDPs. [These cyberattacks travelled across devices, sectors,
jurisdictions, and oceans to ultimately inflict damage.]{.underline}

[Cybersecurity is thus a growing priority]{.underline}. [It is fast
expanding in scope from protecting just critical infrastructure, like
energy and finance, to protecting critical functions, like water
distribution and payment processing, and increasingly the safety and
stability of the structures and individuals underpinning
them]{.underline}. The ambit of cyber threats is gradually creating a
data complex that ties together the digital vulnerabilities of public,
private, civilian, and military sectors. Yet, [widening divergences in
U.S. and European Union (EU) data governance approaches are limiting the
interoperability of data]{.underline} between these sectors, [directly
impacting the ability of the alliance to counter the growing array of
cyber risks]{.underline}.

The [U.S. liberal market-based approach to data centers around data
ownership rights, upholding a property-based regime where companies can
process personal data by default]{.underline}.4 In turn, to extend the
single market into the digital realm, the [EU approach to data is
focused on harmonizing data regimes between its 27 member states,
generally through heavy-handed rights-based regulation]{.underline}.5
[These differences in governance have extended into broader forks in the
handling of data sharing architecture, personal data protection regimes,
and digital intelligence orders.]{.underline}

[Each bifurcation in data policy adds a layer of complexity to
cybersecurity initiatives in the form of new technical standards, trust
services, or supply chain certification considerations.]{.underline}
However[, the current transatlantic cybersecurity status quo is not yet
equipped to handle the variance in data governance regimes]{.underline}.
In the [United States]{.underline}, the main cross-sectoral
cybersecurity framework is created by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology ([NIST]{.underline}) in the form of [a
nonbinding set of best practicesthat companies can apply]{.underline}.
On the other hand, the [EU's]{.underline} Network and Information
Security Directive ([NIS Directive) stipulates digital service providers
operating across Europe enact mandatory cybersecurity
frameworks.]{.underline} In such a scenario, the data of an
international company that operates in both markets will travel through
servers that may have fundamentally different cybersecurity frameworks,
risk management systems, or incident reporting requirements.

[Kept unaligned, these differences risk extending gaps between the
cybersecurity efforts of the transatlantic partners]{.underline}, as
well as creating new ones as new digital initiatives develop. Four
working groups within the recently formed U.S.-EU Trade and Technology
Council are dedicated to coordinating information and communications
technology (ICT) and data governance challenges --- an important
indicator of the priority of digital governance and of the political
will to find common ground.6 In this policy brief, the critical pain
points for transatlantic cybersecurity cooperation are addressed,
outlining rising divergences in data architecture, data protection
regimes, law enforcement cooperation, and cyber interventionist
capacity.7 After highlighting how these divergences create new
cybersecurity gaps, the problem is addressed. The Baltic approach,
characterized by a flexible governance structure, offers one model of
how the transatlantic alliance can leverage data governance from the
bottom up, toward a more integrated transatlantic data relationship.

### Coop = normal means -- Strategic Concept 

#### EU and NATO agree to avoid duplication and to cooperate on multiple items -- normal means

NATO's Madrid Summit?\", CSIS, July 1

Q8: Has the Madrid Summit boosted EU-NATO cooperation?

A8: [The strategic concept cites the European Union as a "unique and
essential partner" and calls for greater cooperation on countering
hybrid tactics]{.underline}, counter terrorism, addressing human
security challenges, military mobility, [resilience,]{.underline}
climate change, [EDTs]{.underline}, NATO's Women, Peace, and Security
agenda, and addressing China's "systemic challenges."

[Existing EU-NATO cooperation already tackle most of these, but the
focus on human security and countering China are new]{.underline}. One
notable absence is a reference to maritime security, which was one of
the original seven areas for EU-NATO cooperation the organizations
identified in 2016. It should be noted the European Union has a growing
ambition in this space.

[Another absence concerns coordination on capability
development]{.underline}, which has generated transatlantic tensions[:
the United States and some other allies have worried a larger role for
the European Union on defense might siphon resources and focus away from
NATO. The final language reflects a compromise in this regard:
"Initiatives to increase defence spending and develop coherent, mutually
reinforcing capabilities, while avoiding unnecessary duplications, are
key to our joint efforts."]{.underline}

[As a revitalized NATO alliance deals with a crisis that has major
economic and humanitarian as well as military dimensions, the need for
it to develop both a European and a global containment strategy grows
ever more urgent.]{.underline}

[Bolstering NATO's defences so as to provide the capability to repel any
form of Russian attack on land, at sea, in the air, or through space and
cyberspace is a key aspect of this strategy]{.underline} as, in recent
weeks, more combat forces able to defend territory have taken the form
of additional troops, ships, and aircraft reinforcing the Baltic states
and the Black Sea coastlines of Poland and Romania.

[Ten allies have so far contributed to this effort, placing 40,000
troops under direct NATO command]{.underline}. [Those sceptical about
the future of the transatlantic security relationship have been
confounded by the major role the US has played in this
effort,]{.underline} sending parts of the 82nd Airborne Division and 3rd
Armoured Division to Poland, and redeploying US Stryker brigades from
Germany and Italy to the Baltic states and Romania.

[Although many other allies have sent useful assets]{.underline} -- such
as French and UK aircraft to Romania or German and Netherlands Patriot
batteries to Slovakia [-- the US contribution still surpasses all
European efforts put together.]{.underline} [The US now has 100,000
troops in Europe]{.underline}, the most it has deployed there since the
mid-1990s.
