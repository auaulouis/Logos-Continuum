### No Escalation

#### No risk of nuclear escalation from cyber attacks

But all of this [focus on cyber operations causing nuclear escalation
may be misplaced and]{.underline}, more importantly, [distract
policymakers]{.underline} from the dangers of a more plausible scenario:
the use of ambiguous cyber signals during nuclear crises. Specifically,
[the nature of cyber operations reduces their inherent escalatory
potential, particularly when compared to other ways a state could attack
an adversary's]{.underline} nuclear forces or command, control, and
communications [systems]{.underline}, like a direct counterforce strike
or employing anti-satellite weapons. But their misuse as a signaling
tool could do more harm than good. First, [successfully conducting cyber
operations]{.underline} against strategic targets, like nuclear systems,
[is harder than the conventional wisdom might suggest.]{.underline} It
requires a means of gaining access to a particular system and developing
an exploit to cause a desired effect --- and then maintaining persistent
(and stealthy) access to be able to conduct an offensive operation at
the desired time. Moreover, [the overall outcome may be unpredictable
and net less-than-desirable results.]{.underline} Second, even if a
state is able to conduct these kinds of operations, they typically
prefer to do so in secret --- and this mitigates some escalation
concerns. That's because, [to cause an escalatory response, a state like
Russia would have to uncover a cyber operation during a particular time
period]{.underline} --- such as while the Ukraine conflict is unfolding.
For example, Russia would have to detect a cyber operation against a
nuclear command and control system to cause Putin to perceive a "window
of vulnerability," perhaps assessing that it is part of a U.S. or NATO
counterforce strategy to disable Russia's ability to retaliate with
nuclear weapons. But [the likelihood of these circumstances arising is
low because --- unless a state is trying to signal with a cyber
capability --- it will try to keep these kinds of sensitive operations
secret.]{.underline} Therefore, [the chances of such an operation being
discovered at a particular time period are]{.underline} relatively
[small.]{.underline} Finally, even if, hypothetically, Russia was to
discover a cyber operation taking place, [the likelihood of it leading
to escalation is low]{.underline}. This is due to [the virtual nature of
cyber "weapons"]{.underline} --- they [rarely cause destruction in the
physical world, let alone permanent damage.]{.underline} For example,
[even Russia's]{.underline} 2015 cyber [attack against Ukraine's power
grid, an important example of a strategic cyber attack against civilian
critical infrastructure, only resulted in service disruptions for a few
hours.]{.underline} During the current conflict, Russia-linked actors
have so far been stymied in using cyber operations for strategic impact,
such as the failed cyber attack by the group Sandworm against Ukraine's
power grid. Taken together, this reasoning suggests that, in practice,
[cyber operations may not rise to a level that would cause a
state]{.underline} like Russia [to actually fear the integrity of its
nuclear command, control, and communications systems, creating few
reasons to escalate to the level of nuclear employment.]{.underline}

## GNSS Impact Defense 

### System Resilient

#### The impact is wildly overstated -- GPS is safe and resilient

Several [recent articles have predicted calamity in]{.underline} the
future relevance of space systems like the Global Positioning System
[(GPS)]{.underline}. This growing trend includes articles with ominous
headlines including, "Spoof, Jam, Destroy: Why We Need a Backup for
GPS," "The GPS Wars Are Here," and "The Death of Precision in Warfare."
Each of these articles highlights vulnerabilities of GPS [without
offering realistic context or caveat to properly scope or provide scale
to the actual threat.]{.underline} In fact, while friction exists in any
endeavor of warfare, [GPS remains resilient in the face of
vulnerabilities, and]{.underline} --- outside of the most total of wars
--- [will remain so.]{.underline} GPS skeptics sometimes mistakenly
conflate technology that is GPS-aided and that which is GPS-dependent.
Moreover, [by failing to appropriately caveat their claims, these
articles suggest GPS's vulnerabilities]{.underline} to jamming,
spoofing, widespread disruption, and even destruction [are
unlimited.]{.underline} These articles also make little or no
distinction between vulnerabilities of civilian systems and military
systems, often concluding GPS should be replaced outright with a
supposedly more resilient but unexplained substitute that would suffer
from the same nuisances. A more realistic characterization should
clarify just how vastly different the risks are between civilian and
military GPS use and take more seriously the numerous unmentioned
advantages in retaining GPS. We spent nearly a decade as U.S. Air Force
weapons officers and have instructed, developed tests, tactics, and
realistic exercises and informed the technical designs of future
planning tools and weapon systems. [The analyses offered by skeptics
breaks drastically from our technical understanding and experience in
examining threats against GPS. We seek to buck the trend of overwhelming
presumption of danger to GPS and other space capabilities that
overstates vulnerability while treating the technical challenge of
threats too vaguely.]{.underline} We also reject the conclusion that GPS
is too fragile to be reliable in warfare regardless of its scale or
scope. [Rather than sweeping claims of impending disaster, in this
article we assert a more measured understanding of GPS's
vulnerabilities]{.underline} for civilian and military users, and a more
reasonable expectation for how both sets of users can respond to denial
attempts and disruption. After that, we proceed to the broader
geopolitical relevance of GPS, responding to suggestions of these
systems' vulnerability to widespread kinetic and cyber attack by
emphasizing just how important the system is to vital national
interests. Finally, we consider whether deterrence safeguards GPS
capabilities against extensive disruption or even complete destruction.

#### GPS is safe -- disruptive attacks are implausible

**Davenport & Ganske 19** \[Brandon, Combat Operations Division Space
Cell Chief at the US Air Force Central Command Combined Air and Space
Operations Center, Rich, editor at the Strategy Bridge & founding member
of the Military Writers Guild, "'Recalculating Route': A Realistic Risk

07/09/22, GDI-JCR\]

Worst Case Scenarios: [Broad Disruption of GPS via]{.underline} Kinetic
or [Cyber Attack]{.underline} Now consider the possibility of even worse
disruption to GPS than mere spoofing or jamming. One GPS skeptic
suggests, "The 24 \[sic\] satellites that keep GPS services running in
the US aren't especially secure; they're vulnerable to screw-ups, or
attacks of the cyber or corporeal kind." The idea here is that while
jamming or spoofing cannot obtain widespread effect, theoretical attacks
against the ground control system, the software, or even the satellites
could still have a disastrous global impact. While these threats are
worthy of consideration, they [are less plausible than assumed. How
would a widespread attack against military GPS systems play out? To
completely deny GPS, an attacker would be forced to physically attack
its critical command and control nodes or render inoperable most of the
satellites. Such suggestions of widespread destruction or disruption
almost always misrepresent the reality of how GPS functions as a
system.]{.underline} Given the semi-autonomous nature of GPS and its
gradual failure design feature, [the effects of any]{.underline} ground
site [attack would be realized only after a protracted lapse of
time.]{.underline} Given the location of GPS satellites in medium Earth
orbit and the realities of accumulated physical attack on individual
satellites, any kinetic attack against the system as a whole would
likely evolve over a multi-day period. An adversary could launch several
co-orbital systems to disrupt or destroy the constellation of GPS
satellites, but this would either require numerous launches or
conspicuous orbital transfers and would likely be detected given the
extent of space situational awareness available to all the major world
powers. Cyber risks to the control of GPS are clearly on the minds of
U.S. defense officials and have resulted in the enactment of stringent
protections. Here again, however, [GPS skeptics overstate the scope of
the threat.]{.underline} This concern may be, in part, the result of
popular plot presumptions more akin to a novelized portrayal of the next
world war than to real-world threats. Against the threat of cyber
attack, a defender has the option to harden systems against access or
use the system in a manner mitigating the threat. Regarding GPS, the
U.S. military has opted to do both. While imprudent to claim a
100-percent secure system, [the Department of Defense is working to make
GPS as hardened a target as possible.]{.underline} Cyber attacks seeking
to control the satellites themselves would require individually updating
each of the satellites within the constellation with malicious code. Any
upload to the whole system would take significant time, at least tens of
hours, due to how contact is made with each satellite in their medium
Earth orbits. In the meantime, [the overwhelming scrutiny the GPS signal
is under from U.S. military and civil monitoring stations, as well as
from commercial augmentation services, surveyors, academic institutions,
and others, could note any degradation or oddity in near real-time long
before any aggressor attack could create widespread impact.]{.underline}
And when a cyber attack is noted on one satellite, the control center
stops subsequent contacts with other GPS satellites --- precluding the
spread of malicious code through the system. Realistically, because of
the orbits of the GPS satellites and practical process, any disruption
via this tactic would be obvious after the first few uploads and likely
thwarted far before culmination. Our point is not to suggest a
widespread attack on all 31 satellites in the GPS constellation is
impossible. If a satellite can be put into orbit an anti-satellite
weapon can reach it. If cyber controls GPS satellites then
vulnerabilities must exist. Instead, the question is how to exploit
these at such a scale, with such surprise, to obtain a widespread result
without time to respond. [Complete denial of GPS --- via kinetic or
cyber attack --- while maybe technically possible, is implausible as it
would connote an enormous, perhaps even apocalyptic,
escalation.]{.underline} Instead of assuming complete denial of GPS, we
recommend --- and have taught --- Western forces to learn necessary
variety in tactics that allows for overmatch when GPS is available and
how to retain an advantage should adversaries degrade it. Additionally,
the Department of Defense has undertaken and considered an expansion of
its complement of proficiencies with GPS as a core capability; such
redundancy is far preferable to supplanting GPS with a replacement that
would still be subject to most of the nuisances noted in the
aforementioned articles.

#### System is resilient and impact would be minimal

Conclusion [While the potential for disruption of]{.underline} the
dual-use [GPS]{.underline} system [continues to be a
nuisance]{.underline} to both civilian life and military operations, an
[assessment of the facts]{.underline} and contexts [shows the end is not
actually so near for GPS. The system is more resilient than pessimists
allow]{.underline}, and replacing a proven investment with thin promises
of alternative resilience is bad advice. Further, [nuisance and
vulnerability are not the same thing.]{.underline} Finally, this article
has explored what could happen if GPS's widespread disruption or
destruction is followed to a logical conclusion. [A day without GPS,
while perhaps possible, is implausible given how reliably well the
system performs even under stress]{.underline} and how widespread
destruction would be an escalation toward the extreme against a vital
interest --- an interest which all the major powers now share given
their own equivalently vulnerable systems. Ultimately, [a day without
GPS is unlikely]{.underline} not because of the technology, but [because
of the human capacity to overcome nuisance in daily life and fight back
using clever tactics.]{.underline}

#### The military has a backup ready in case of GPS disruption

[The US military requires reliable backup capabilities that allow it to
be less dependent on satellite data.]{.underline} To do so, it must find
new and comprehensive ways to identify threats to US timing systems.
This means developing network operations that create, maintain, and
improve timing sources and precision. [There are many ways of measuring
and distributing timing that do not rely on GPS or navigation
systems.]{.underline} Examples include DARPA's Chip-Scale Atomic Clock
and palm-sized Atomic Clock with Enhanced Stability (ACES).11 Before
GPS, Long Range Aids to Navigation (LORAN) was used to aid navigators
around the world. [LORAN is a ground-based system of receivers and
transmitters]{.underline} that was first developed during World War II.
By the mid-1990s, LORAN tower networks were [able to provide coverage
for North America, Europe, and some other regions]{.underline},
primarily in the US and Canada. As GPS became available for civilian use
in 1995, LORAN's popularity declined. GPS was more accurate and widely
available. However, The US Coast Guard continued to work on an improved
version of LORAN, called the "[Enhanced" LORAN]{.underline}, or eLORAN.
The enhanced system [would be able to provide position accuracy
comparable to GPS. In addition, the signal was designed to be resistant
to jamming]{.underline}, broadcasting at hundreds of thousands of watts.
[Unlike GPS, eLORAN could even receive signals indoors, underwater, and
in cityscapes or natural canyons or valleys.]{.underline}12

### No Attack

#### Our nuclear deterrent solves GPS attack

**Davenport & Ganske 19** \[Brandon, Combat Operations Division Space
Cell Chief at the US Air Force Central Command Combined Air and Space
Operations Center, Rich, editor at the Strategy Bridge & founding member
of the Military Writers Guild, "'Recalculating Route': A Realistic Risk

07/09/22, GDI-JCR\]

Finally, it is important to examine two other factors: escalation
control and unintended collateral damage to vital interests. Again, to
be clear, temporary nuisances are not a vital threat and the distinction
between jamming or spoofing and widespread destruction of GPS is
crucial. But what would happen to society if a frustrated adversary
chose, despite the difficulty, widespread destruction of the GPS
constellation? The positional and timing aspects of the system play an
important role in 14 of the 16 sectors classified as critical
infrastructure according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
One assessment states the "\[t\]otal economic impact of GPS is virtually
the size of the whole \[U.S.\] economy." Another report suggests the
global economic impact of GPS is over \$2 trillion dollars per year and
growing, with most of that benefiting the West. This is why other major
and regional powers are seeking GPS-like parity with indigenous systems
(which share the same vulnerabilities as GPS). Because GPS has such a
far-ranging impact on society, any total countervalue attack creating a
lasting effect on the system would likely be seen as a vital threat to
Western society. Such a concern crosses the boundary into subjective
considerations of conflict escalation. [While banking delays, glitches
in some power grids, and other awful outcomes might occur from complete
denial of GPS, there is no guarantee it would wreck civilization. But
any major power sophisticated enough to accomplish a widespread
counter-GPS operation cannot be certain precisely how it would
unfold.]{.underline} There will be many knock-on effects outside the
scope of military conflict. Here arise concerns of escalation and
geopolitical risk, especially as potential adversaries open themselves
to similar risks to their own versions of GPS. [Just as the major powers
are constrained in using nuclear weapons for limited means, any
widespread attack against GPS would be viewed as
disproportionate.]{.underline} The signal in escalation would not only
occur slowly as noted but also directly against vital interests. [The
United States would, at the least, respond in kind. Taking all of this
into consideration, it is reasonable to believe GPS is protected against
widespread attack under the same aegis of deterrence protecting other
vital interests: the possibility of nuclear escalation.]{.underline}

### Alt Causes

#### Too many alt causes of GPS disruption to solve

**Dawson 19** \[Linda, Senior Lecturer Emeritus at UW Tacoma in
Statistics and Physical Science, Aeronautical Flight Controller on the
Space Shuttle Program at NASA, Navigation and Guidance Engineer for the
Boeing Space Center, *War in Space: the science and technology behind
our next theater of conflict*, p.9-10, GDI-JCR\]

In 2012, the Department of Homeland Security [(DHS)]{.underline}
performed a GPS risk estimate. It was [determined that the system's weak
signals are problematic, allowing interference to happen rather easily.
Disruption can originate from ground-based sources]{.underline} in
several different ways. Possible hackers could feed incorrect data into
critical resource equipment, causing power outages and location errors.
[Signal jammers could disable cell phone service and emergency
communication]{.underline}, leaving fire, police, and emergency medical
to conduct business using older methods. Transactions would be limited
to cash, which could be difficult to access without ATM services. The
longer it takes to locate the jamming devices, the more systems are
affected, causing confusion and chaos.16 A more complex disruption
device is called a "spoofer." Equipment in these [spoofing systems
produces mimicked signals that trick GPS receivers]{.underline} to lock
onto them. The spoofed systems cause altered time and position data to
be transmitted to unaware users. There is no associated alarm that
indicates that anything is wrong. There has been evidence that Russia is
testing a new GPS spoofing device. In 2017, the GPS on a ship in the
Black Sea reported the ship's position as 20 miles inland at a nearby
airport. The navigation equipment was verified as working properly. To
investigate the problem, the captain contacted other nearby ships. Their
GPS signals also placed them at the same airport. Although the incident
has not been confirmed, it is believed that about 20 ships were
affected. Experts think that this is the first known case of GPS
spoofing.17 In addition to location errors, spoofing can cause
communication breakdowns and market failures. It is a real threat that
can be activated almost entirely with software code. It was thought that
the biggest threat to GPS was jamming it by masking the satellite signal
with noise. Although this can create confusion, jamming is easy to
detect, causing GPS receivers to sound an alarm when the signal is lost
by this method. [Spoofing is a stealthier technique, generating a false
signal from a ground station that mimics a real signal and fools the
satellite receiver.]{.underline} "Jamming just causes the receiver to
die, spoofing causes the receiver to lie," says consultant David Last,
former president of the United Kingdom's Royal Institute of
Navigation.18 The US Department of Homeland Security has focused on GPS
disruption for the past several years. It has listed both the
intentional and unintentional [threats to the satellite
system]{.underline}. The unintentional list [includes space weather,
space debris, faulty software, and human error]{.underline}, among other
things. Space weather is potentially the most devastating threat. [Solar
flares erupting high energy radiation from the Sun have already disabled
satellites in the past.]{.underline} Figure 1.3 is an image of an active
region on the Sun emitting a mid-level solar flare in 2014. Harmful
radiation from large flares is capable of passing through the layer of
the Earth's atmosphere where GPS and communications signals travel, even
though it cannot pass completely through the atmosphere to affect humans
on the surface.19

## OCOs Answers 

### OCOs -- escalation 

#### OCOs undermine norms and increase risk of escalation -- defensive policy solves best

**Valeriano 19** (Brandon - Donald Bren Chair of Armed Politics at the

Offense: The Case for Restraint," 1/15/19,

We demonstrate that, while cyber operations to date have not been
escalatory or particularly effective in achieving decisive outcomes,
[recent policy changes and strategy pronouncements by the Trump
administration increase the risk of escalation while doing nothing to
make cyber operations more effective. These changes revolve around a
dangerous myth: offense is an effective and easy way to stop rival
states from hacking America. New policies for authorizing preemptive
offensive cyber strategies risk crossing a threshold and changing the
rules of the game.]{.underline} Cyberspace to date has been a domain of
political warfare and coercive diplomacy. [An offensively postured cyber
policy is dangerous, counterproductive, and undermines norms in
cyberspace.]{.underline} Many have promoted the idea of a coming "Cyber
Pearl Harbor," but instead the domain is littered with covert operations
meant to manage escalation and deter future attacks. Cyber strategy and
policy must start from an accurate understanding of the domain, not
imagined realities. Senior [leaders]{.underline} throughout the federal
government [should consider a more prudent and restrained
approach]{.underline} to cyber operations. We argue for a defensive
posture consisting of limited cyber operations aimed at restraining
rivals and avoiding escalation. At the same time, [the United States
should focus on protective measures to make U.S. systems less vulnerable
and on sharing intelligence with allies and partners.]{.underline} A
policy of restraint that maintains control over the weapons of cyber war
is strategically wise.

#### SQ has avoided cyber escalation -- increasing offensive capabilities would create unique risk for great power conflict spirals

**Valeriano 19** (Brandon - Donald Bren Chair of Armed Politics at the
Marine Corps University & Benjamin Jensen, "The Myth of the Cyber
Offense: The Case for Restraint," 1/15/19,

Contrary to observed patterns of limited disruption and espionage, Cyber
Command sees cyberspace as a domain fraught with increasing risk, where
great powers such as China and Russia will undermine American power. The
only solution, from this perspective, is to go on the offense. Yet, [the
benefits of an offensive posture]{.underline}, especially [in
cyberspace, are]{.underline} mostly [illusory]{.underline} to date.
Instead, [the cyber domain tends to be optimized for
defense]{.underline} and deception, [not decisive offensive blows. Not
only is offense likely the weaker form of competition in cyberspace, it
also risks inadvertent escalation. The fear, suspicion, and
misperception that characterize interstate rivalries exacerbate the risk
of offensive action in cyberspace.]{.underline} Cyber Command's 2018
persistent-action strategy aims to "expose adversaries' weaknesses,
learn their intentions and capabilities, and counter attacks close to
their origins."44 Put in simple terms, the best defense is a good
offense: get on adversary networks and stop cyber operations targeting
the United States before they occur. Under this strategy, offensive
cyber operations will also be preemptive in that they are designed to
"contest dangerous adversary activity before it impairs \[U.S.\]
national power."45 To use another sports metaphor, come out swinging. Go
on the offense first and establish escalation dominance (that is,
demonstrating such superior capabilities over the target state that it
can't afford to escalate in response).46 According to Cyber Command,
preemptive strikes will "impose . . . strategic costs on our
adversaries, compelling them to shift resources to defense and reduce
attacks."47 Whether through punishment, risk, or denial strategies,
offensive actions theoretically alter the target's behavior by
increasing the expected costs of targeting U.S. interests.48 Offensive
action, according to this thinking, deters future aggression by
signaling resolve and establishing escalation dominance. Yet, [there are
well-established reasons to doubt that offensive options produce the
intended results in cyberspace.]{.underline} [The rationale behind
persistent action]{.underline}---that the best defense is a good
offense---[is deeply flawed.]{.underline} In fact, most military and
strategic theory holds that the defense is the superior posture.49 For
example, Sun Tzu describes controlling an adversary to make their
actions more predictable, and hence easy to undermine, by baiting them
to attack strong points.50 The stronger form of war is a
deception-driven defense: confusing an attacker so that they waste
resources attacking strong points that appear weak. This parallels
cybersecurity scholars Erik Gartzke and Jon Lindsay's claim that
cyberspace is not offense dominant, but deception dominant.51 [Rather
than persistent action and preemptive strikes on adversary networks, the
United States needs persistent deception and defensive counterstrikes
optimized to undermine adversary planning and capabilities.]{.underline}
New policy options proposed by Cyber Command and the Trump
administration risk exacerbating fear in other countries and creating a
self-reinforcing spiral of tit-for-tat escalations that risk war even
though each actor feels he is acting defensively---or, as it is called
in the scholarly literature, a security dilemma.52 As shown above, [most
cyber operations to date have not resulted in escalation]{.underline}.
The cyber domain has been a world of spies collecting valuable
information and engaging in limited disruptions that substitute for, as
well as complement, more conventional options. [Shifting to a policy of
preemptive offensive cyber warfare risks provoking fear and overreaction
in other states and possibly producing conflict spirals. Even
limited-objective cyber offensive action defined as "defending forward"
can be misinterpreted and lead to inadvertent escalation.]{.underline}53
As the historian Cathal Nolan puts it, "intrusions into a state's
strategically important networks pose serious risks and are therefore
inherently threatening."54 More worryingly, [with a more offensive
posture, it will be increasingly difficult for states to differentiate
between cyber espionage and more damaging degradation
operations.]{.underline}55 [What the United States calls defending
forward, China and Russia will call preemptive strikes.]{.underline}
Worse still, [this posture will likely lead great powers to assume all
network intrusions, including espionage, are preparing the environment
for follow-on offensive strikes.]{.underline} According to cybersecurity
scholar Ben Buchanan, "in the \[aggressor\] state's own view, such moves
are clearly defensive, merely ensuring that its military will have the
strength and flexibility to meet whatever comes its way. Yet potential
adversaries are unlikely to share this perspective."56 [The new strategy
risks producing a "forever cyber war" prone to inadvertent escalation
because it implies all cyber operations should be interpreted as
escalatory by adversaries.]{.underline}57

## Space War Impact Defense 

### No Space War

#### Virtually zero risk of space war. Satellite systems are redundant. The impact is a lie hyped by defense experts to justify military expenditures

**Johnson-Freese & Hitchens 16 edited for language** \[Joan, Prof of
National Security Affairs at US Naval War College, Theresa, Senior

accessed 07/09/22, GDI-JCR\]

In the last two years, we've seen [rising]{.underline} ~~hysteria~~
[\[hype\] over a future war in space]{.underline}. Fanning the flames
are not only dire assessments from the US military, but also breathless
coverage from a cooperative and credulous press. This reporting [doesn't
only muddy public debate over whether we really need expensive systems.
It could also become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The irony is that
nothing makes the currently slim possibility of war in space more likely
than fearmongering over the threat of war in space.]{.underline} Two
television programs in the past two years show how egregious this
fearmongering can get. In April 2015, the CBS show 60 Minutes ran a
segment called "The Battle Above." In an interview with [General John
Hyten]{.underline}, the then-[chief of U.S. Air Force Space
Command]{.underline}, it [came across loud and clear that the United
States was being forced to prepare for a battle in space]{.underline}
--- specifically against China --- that it really didn't want. Gen. John
Hyten: It's a competition that I wish wasn't occurring, but it is. And
if we're threatened in space, we have the right of self-defense, and
we'll make sure we can execute that right. David Martin: And use force
if necessary. Gen. John Hyten: That's why we have a military. You know,
I'm not NASA. [It was explained by Hyten and other guests that China is
building a considerable amount of hardware and accumulating significant
know-how regarding space, all threatening to space assets Americans
depend on every day. If viewers weren't frightened after watching the
segment, it wasn't for lack of trying]{.underline} on the part of CBS.
[Using terms like "offensive counterspace" as a 1984 NewSpeak euphemism
for "weapons," it was made clear that the United States had no choice
but to spend billions of dollars on offensive counterspace technology to
not just thwart the Chinese threat, but control and dominate
space.]{.underline} While it didn't actually distort facts --- just omit
facts about current U.S. space capabilities --- the segment was
basically a cost-free commercial for the military-industrial complex. In
retrospect though, "The Battle Above" was pretty good compared to CNN's
recent special, War in Space: The Next Battlefield. The latter might as
well have been called Sharknado in Space -- because the only far-out
weapons technology our potential adversaries don't have, according to
the broadcast, seems to be "sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to
their heads!" First, CNN needs to hire some fact checkers. Saying
"unlike its adversaries, the U.S. has not yet weaponized space" is
deeply misleading, like saying "unlike his political opponents,
President-Elect Donald Trump has not sprouted wings and flown away": [A
few (admittedly alarming) weapons tests aside, no country in the world
has yet weaponized space.]{.underline} Contrary to CNN, stock market
transactions are not timed nor synchronized through GPS, but a closed
system. Cruise missiles can find their targets even without GPS, because
they have both GPS and precision inertial measurement units onboard, and
IMUs don't rely on satellite data. Oh, and the British rock group Pink
Floyd holds the only claim to the Dark Side of the Moon: There is a "far
side" of the Moon --- the side always turned away from the Earth --- but
not a "dark side" --- which would be a side always turned away from the
Sun. More nefariously, the segment sensationalized nuggets of truth
within a barrage of half-truths, backed by a heavy bass, dramatic
soundtrack (and gravelly-voiced reporter Jim Sciutto) and accompanied by
sexy and scary visuals. Make no mistake there are dangers in space, and
the United States has the most to lose if space assets are lost. The
question is how best to protect them. Here are a few facts CNN omitted.
The U.S. has all of the technologies described on the CNN segment and
deemed potentially offensive: maneuverable satellites, nano-satellites,
lasers, jamming capabilities, robotic arms, ballistic missiles that can
be used as anti-satellite weapons, etc. In fact, the United States is
more technologically advanced than other countries in both military and
commercial space. That technological superiority scares other countries;
just as the U.S. military space community is scared of other countries
obtaining those technologies in the future. The U.S. military space
budget is more than 10 times greater than that of all the countries in
the world combined. That also causes other countries concern. More
unsettling still, the United States has long been leery of treaty-based
efforts to constrain a potential arms race in outer space, as supported
by nearly every other country in the world for decades. Indeed, under
the administration of George W. Bush, the U.S. talking points centered
on the mantra "there is no arms race in outer space," so there is no
need for diplomat instruments to constrain one. Now, a decade later,
[the U.S. military]{.underline} -- backed by the Intelligence Community
which operates the nation's spy satellites -- [seems to be shouting to
the rooftops that the United States is in danger of losing the space
arms race already begun by its potential adversaries.]{.underline} The
underlying assumption --- a convenient one for advocates of more
military spending --- is that now there is nothing that diplomacy can
do. However, it must be remembered that most space-related technologies
-- with the exception of ballistic missiles and dedicated jammers --
have both military and civil/commercial uses; both benign --- indeed,
helpful --- and nefarious uses. For example, giving satellites the
ability to maneuver on orbit can allow useful inspections of ailing
satellites and possibly even repairs. Further, the United States is not
unable to protect its satellites, as repeated during the CNN broadcast
by various interviewees and the host. Many U.S. government-owned
satellites, including precious spy satellites, have capabilities to
maneuver. Many are hardened against electro-magnetic pulse, sport
"shutters" to protect optical "eyes" from solar flares and lasers, and
use radio frequency hopping to resist jamming. Offensive weapons,
deployed on the ground to attack satellites, or in space, are not a
silver bullet. To the contrary, U.S. deployment of such weapons may
actually be detrimental to U.S. and international security in space (as
we argued in a recent Atlantic Council publication, Towards a New
National Security Space Strategy). Further, there are benefits to
efforts started by the Obama Administration to find diplomatic tools to
restrain and constrain dangerous military activities in space. These
diplomatic efforts, however, would be undercut by a full-out U.S.
pursuit of "space dominance." This includes dialogue with China, the
lack of which Gen. William Shelton, retired commander of Air Force Space
Command, lamented in the CNN report. Given CNN's "cast," the spin was
not surprising. Starting with Ghost Fleet author Peter Singer set the
sensationalist tone, which never altered. [The apocalyptic
opening]{.underline}, inspired by Ghost Fleet, posited a scenario [where
all U.S. satellites are taken off-line in nearly one fell
swoop]{.underline}. Unless we are talking about an alien invasion, that
scenario [is nigh on impossible. No potential adversary has such
capabilities, nor will they ever likely do so. There is just too much
redundancy in the system.]{.underline} General Hyten, now head of U.S.
Strategic Command, has perfected his sound bites regarding the threats.
Other military officials -- and of course a DoD contractor -- gave what
should be expected as their (worst case) perspectives. But theirs is not
the only perspective. And no alternate views were offered. [The whole
show reached its crescendo when "the answer" was revealed]{.underline}
toward the end. [The U.S. military needs more of everything. It needs to
have such overwhelming "stuff" that nobody would dare attack U.S.
assets.]{.underline} It needs an offensive arsenal. [It needs more
money. CNN certainly did its part in scaring the bejesus out of the
American public and Congress -- and thus helping the Pentagon make its
case.]{.underline} In Part II of this article, out tomorrow, we'll
explain how US policy went down this alarmist rabbit hole and how to get
it back on track.

### No Space War -- China

#### Low risk of US/China nuclear escalation over ASATs

**Acton 18** \[James, Jessica T. Mathews Chair and co-director of the
Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, "Escalation through Entanglement: How the Vulnerability of
Command-and-Control Systems Raises the Risks of an Inadvertent Nuclear
War," *International Security*,

[The risk of the United States\' misinterpreting Chinese nonnuclear
strikes against dual-use U.S. C3I assets as preparations for nuclear use
would]{.underline} probably [be low]{.underline}er than in the case of
Russia for two reasons. First, in contrast to Moscow, [Beijing has
adopted a no-first-use pledge.]{.underline} Second, unlike their Russian
counterparts, [Chinese leaders can have absolutely no doubt that nuclear
first use would do nothing to meaningfully limit the damage their
country would suffer in a nuclear war with the United States. As a
result, Washington would be unlikely to interpret Chinese nonnuclear
strikes as preparations to fight and win a strategic nuclear
war.]{.underline}

#### China avoiding conflict involving space assets -- they're too invested and it would be lose-lose

**Pollpeter 15** (Kevin, Eric Anderson Research Analyst on the Study of
Innovation and Technology in China for the Institute On Global Conflict
And Cooperation. Institute On Global Conflict And Cooperation, China

Moreover, what is unwritten in Chinese analyses is that [as China
becomes more invested in space capabilities it takes on the same
vulnerabilities as the United States]{.underline}. Although China would
not have the same asymmetries as the United States in a conflict in the
Western Pacific, the goal of having a global, 24- hour, all-weather
remote sensing capability and spending nearly \$1 billion per year until
2020 to establish a global satellite navigation system and associated
technologies indicates that [China is devoting significant effort and
resources to establish a system that is similar in architecture to that
of the U.S.]{.underline} military's space program. [With this
trajectory, China will have as much to lose as it has to gain from the
management or mismanagement of the outer space global commons. It is in
this vein that some sort of strategic accommodation that ameliorates the
worst effects of competition could be achieved.]{.underline}

#### The US and China are avoiding miscalc and escalation with a communications hotline for space activities.

**Schouten 15** (Lucy. Christian Science Monitor Rapid Response Team
Writer. CSM. Conflict resolution in space: First hotline since the Cold
War.
http://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2015/1125/Conflict-resolution-in-space-First-hotline-since-the-Cold-War)

[The two governments have set up a direct hotline to communicate about
space operations. The countries are supposed to use the hotline to
discuss any collisions or plans that might impact the other nation\'s
space operations,]{.underline} Sam Jones for the Financial Times
reports. \"We've also made it clear that we will do what is necessary to
protect the space assets of the United States,\" US Assistant Secretary
of State Frank Rose told the Times. \"We all have a lot to lose.\" [The
hotline shortens communication between Washington and Beijing by several
steps]{.underline}. Officials previously routed messages through the
Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This meant they sent messages from
the Joint Space Operations Center \"to the Pentagon to the state
department, to the US embassy in Beijing, and then on to a contact
there,\" Mr. Rose told the Times. Then the process would begin again on
the Chinese side. [Shortening that line of communication]{.underline} by
cutting out the middlemen [is a step forward for the solar system, as
the US will now have structures in place to handle problems that may
arise with China, a growing power in the space industry. It marks a move
to try and prevent conflict in explored space,]{.underline} which would
cause significant damage to the US economy and military operations.
\"Our societies are becoming more and more dependent on space,\"
Patricia Lewis, research director at Chatham House international affairs
think-tank in London, told the Times. [Establishing a special hotline
between aeronautical powerhouses is not without precedent. The US kept a
direct line of communication open with the Soviet Union even during the
tense moments of the Cold War to prevent **a mistake from becoming a
crisis**.]{.underline} Such a development is a long time coming, as an
incident occurred back in 2007 that revealed the problems resulting from
conflicts in space. China conducted its first successful test of an
anti-satellite weapon and blew up a satellite. The US had previously
been the only nation with this kind of weapons capability, and it was a
shock not only because the satellite was destroyed but also because it
increased space debris dangerously, the BBC reported. [A hotline such as
this is a step in the \"settling\" process of near space]{.underline},
says Bruce MacDonald, who led the Council on Foreign Relations study of
China, space weapons, and US security and is adjunct faculty with the
John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
