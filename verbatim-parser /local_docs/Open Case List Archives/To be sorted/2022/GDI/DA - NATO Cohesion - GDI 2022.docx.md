# NATO Cohesion/Focus DA 

## Notes 

While the preinstitute DA thesis was about NATO focus on territorial
defense -- the new strategic concept reaffirms this IS the focus of NATO
-- by not including resiliency as a fourth core task, for example. The
argument has now shifted a bit -- NATO cohesion or unity, demonstrated
by the Summit, necessary to deter China.

Different/new-ish link arguments, however, could be made based on the
way that the plan implements the Strategic Concept -- in other words,
vague support for misinformation or for biotech \[with concrete ways to
do it\] will undermine the unity and cohesion of the Alliance --
triggering old problems of consensus building. The plan itself would
require consensus building -- that also undermines the unity of the
alliance.

Prioritization of policies by NATO key to credibility as well -- and you
could develop this argument later into a common funding argument, in our
opinion.

Another element of the DA is whether or not EU-NATO cooperation trades
off with resources for NATO -- and so you could definitely use these
cards as part of the 'internal net benefit' to EU CP. Some cards argue
that the unity from Ukraine invasion risks fracturing if there is NO
acknowledgement of strategic autonomy/responsibility \[see cards above
on EU CP\]

#### Uniqueness - Madrid provided turning point for NATO -- but cohesion not guaranteed -- must be vigilent

[The Madrid Summit also marks a major turning point for NATO and
transatlantic relations in (a) the post-Cold War, (b) post-9/11 and (c)
post-Afghan War eras. The alliance is adapting to new threats and
challenges whilst expanding its membership, all while recommitting
resources to its original strategic adversary]{.underline}. It is easy
to conclude that NATO has the upper hand and Moscow will fade into
irrelevance, it's actions in Ukraine proving that it should have no
place at the table of respectable nations. However, [NATO's continued
strength and unity is far from assured, and it will be important for
European leaders not to become complacent.]{.underline} At the beginning
of 2022, few would have predicted that NATO would be in the position it
is today. [A moment of crisis can unexpectedly galvanise an alliance of
30 very different member states stretching across three continents and
with distinct histories]{.underline}. However, it can also reveal where
true interests and values lie, and where the fissures that will
inevitably outlast the current crisis are located and threaten the
alliance's response to the next challenge once the platitudes and
commitments made in Madrid are long past. [For now, however, Madrid is
its own]{.underline} form of 'Zeitenwende', an [unexpected but welcome
watershed moment that demands bold and inspiring action amidst political
upheaval.]{.underline}

--- [prioritize **everything**]{.underline}, [thereby fulfilling the old

[strong]{.underline}. It [is easy to understand why]{.underline}, in the
present climate of global instability, [calls for the transatlantic

simultaneously adding new mandates, missions, and programs are
popular]{.underline}. [Rather than adding more items to its already

Strategic foresight [Survival and success also depend on having the
right strategy, but obtaining such a thing is difficult.]{.underline}
Some scholars, aware of the bureaucratic and political blinkers that
impede clear thinking, have bemoaned the 'forgotten' or 'lost' art of
strategy-making. Others have pointed to strategy's illusory nature,
given its application to circumstances that are usually too
unpredictable and too complex to produce the intended results. Despite
these obstacles, strategy is ubiquitous. [No organisation]{.underline} -
whether a government, a military, a company or, indeed, an alliance [--
can in good conscience face the world without one. Whatever its
limitations, strategy is better than the alternatives:]{.underline}
taking a shot in the dark, relying on primordial concepts such as
honour, reputation and glory, or falling back on habit and
path-dependent thinking. Good strategy needs to be constantly adjusted
to changing circumstances. It also needs to be appreciative of what is
possible (not just what is desirable), and conscious of the resources
necessary to meet specified objectives. Above all, as Sir Lawrence
Freedman has argued, to adopt a strategy is to embrace choice; it is a
recognition that the environment an actor faces can be tamed and not
simply allowed to run amok. [NATO sits reasonably well within this
understanding]{.underline}. Throughout its history, [the Alliance has
paid considerable attention to formulating and agreeing strategy, and
then coordinating Allied efforts on the basis of constantly updated
concepts, political guidance, and military doctrine.]{.underline} [These
efforts often assume enormous political significance]{.underline}. The
1967 Harmel Report on 'The Future Tasks of the Alliance', according to
one assessment, rescued NATO from 'the most severe crisis in its
history' following France's departure from the Alliance's integrated
military structures. The 1990 London Declaration and the 1991 Strategic
Concept were similarly pathbreaking and helped NATO transition into the
post-Cold War period. [These precedents mean NATO's more recent
top-level documents]{.underline} -- [the Strategic Concepts]{.underline}
of 1999 and 2010 as well as the [anticipated update of 2022 -- come
freighted with huge significance. Externally, they are NATO's public
face on the world]{.underline}: key statements of relevance and purpose.
[Internally, they are important exercises in consensus building among
the Allies]{.underline}. But while significant in their own right[, the
Strategic Concepts are only one expression of NATO's strategic
coherence. Beneath them sit obscure, often classified but, nonetheless,
operationally significant statements of purpose]{.underline}. In recent
years such documents have been adopted at pace. In 2019, NATO approved a
new Military Strategy, and in 2020 two implementing documents - a
Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the Euro-Atlantic Area and a
Warfighting Capstone Concept. In 2021, the Allies agreed to action plans
on climate change and Women, Peace and Security, as well as a
'Strengthened Resilience Commitment' and a cyber defence policy. An
'Overarching Space Policy' followed in January 2022. [NATO is due to
formally adopt its new Strategic Concept at the Madrid summit in June
2022]{.underline}. The draft is already being reworked in light of the
Ukraine crisis. It seems likely also that [the NATO Military Strategy
will end up with a revamp shortly after.]{.underline}

Upon taking office, President Joe [Biden made it a priority to repair
the damage his predecessor]{.underline}, Donald Trump[, had
done]{.underline} to relationships with the United States' long-standing
allies and partners, including South Korea and Japan, but particularly
[in Europe]{.underline}. Early on, Biden reassured European allies of
Washington's commitment to their security, promising them, "America is
back. The trans-Atlantic alliance is back." Despite some missteps along
the way, the [political capital Biden invested in shoring up ties with
Europe, in particular, has paid off during the current standoff with
Russia over Ukraine. NATO's cohesion in the runup to the invasion and
the robustness of the U.S.-led economic and security response in its
aftermath are testament to the alliance's value to the U.S.---as well as
the importance of U.S. leadership in times of crisis.]{.underline}

[The ongoing Russian aggression in Ukraine]{.underline} since 2014 [has
entirely changed the security landscape]{.underline}, not only in the
Euro-Atlantic area, but globally. [It has fundamentally altered threat
perceptions beyond the Alliance,]{.underline} leading Finland and Sweden
to officially apply for membership in NATO. These two countries have
indeed crossed the Rubicon and deserted their neutrality in response to
persistent Russian belligerence in the middle of Europe. Their decision
to combine their efforts and assets with the Alliance against Russian
aggression is natural and legitimate. Hence the need to incorporate
Finland and Sweden into the Alliance family. The trilateral memorandum
signed among Turkey, Finland, and Sweden on June 28 is a welcome
development designed to demonstrate NATO's solidarity and unity, and
further strengthen the Alliance. [It is commonplace in NATO to consult
on and negotiate over any dispute among allies and would-be allies to
find a common ground. That is how NATO plays its role, and at the end a
solution accommodating such concerns is found by consensus.]{.underline}
It is also true that once new members accede to NATO, they are bound by
the decisions previously taken by the Alliance on a wide range of
subjects. In NATO there exists a robust set of decisions and practices
in fighting terrorism, beginning with the intervention in Afghanistan.
Therefore, there is already an agreement comprising all sorts of
conceptual work and practices in different geographical theaters on
combatting terrorism, developed within NATO and binding on all members.
The newly adopted Strategic Concept (SC) clearly identifies Russia and
"terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations" as the primary sources
of threats in a 360-degree manner and across all three core tasks of
NATO: collective deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and
management, and cooperative security. Given that terrorism is "the most
direct asymmetric threat to the security of our citizens and to
international peace and prosperity," as defined in the SC, it makes
sense both for Finland and Sweden to cooperate with Turkey in combatting
terrorism as one of the primary sources of threats against Alliance
interests. [In a nutshell, collective deterrence and defense against
actual and potential adversaries, nipping crises in the bud, and
expanding the web of networks with partners under challenging
circumstances are the main tasks of NATO in the next decade. The main
center of gravity for NATO is its solidarity, unity, and cohesion,
including all allies and those set to become allies. The summit
decisions in their entirety will help NATO to navigate the troubled
waters ahead over the long term.]{.underline}

After years of its relevance being questioned by former President Trump
and even being described as 'brain-dead' by French President Macron[,
NATO]{.underline} is [meeting at Madrid at a time of renewed strength
and invigoration of the alliance.]{.underline} [The past few months have
witnessed significant alliance cohesion in the face of Russia's
aggression in Ukraine]{.underline}, with two new states, Sweden, and
Finland, set to join after Turkey has lifted its opposition. [NATO's
cause for existence has never seemed clearer, yet serious rifts remain,
and the unity of the alliance is not guaranteed as the war in Ukraine
goes on]{.underline} and domestic pressures across member states
increase. Putin's invasion of Ukraine has led NATO closer to Russia's
borders, not further away, and more troops will be permanently stationed
on NATO's eastern flank, including a new permanent U.S. base in Poland.
For Putin, this is undoubtedly the opposite effect of what he intended,
however Ukraine is no closer to joining NATO and the prospect of a
prolonged conflict in its disputed territories will likely stall Kyiv's
accession for the foreseeable future.

[Thanks to Russian President Vladimir Putin, NATO's Madrid Summit takes
place this week against the backdrop of a resurgent Western alliance.
Putin's invasion of Ukraine compels NATO to return to its founding
mission of providing collective defense against Russia]{.underline}.
[Members of the alliance are demonstrating remarkable unity and
resolve]{.underline} as they funnel arms to Ukraine, increase defense
spending, bolster the alliance's eastern flank, and impose severe
economic sanctions against Russia.

The invasion of Ukraine has shown that NATO is back, but the reality is
that it never went away. [The alliance was actually in good shape even
before Putin launched his errant war, which is one of the reasons that
it has been able to respond to developments in Ukraine with such
alacrity and solidarity]{.underline}. Since the Cold War's end, NATO has
demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt to the times, undertaking
operations far afield, including in Afghanistan and in the Balkans, and
opening its doors to Europe's new democracies. [As a consequence of the
war in Ukraine, an already strong NATO just got stronger.]{.underline}

[But despite its clean bill of health and demonstrable unity, NATO faces
a thicket of thorny issues, and discussions in Madrid will only just
begin to address them]{.underline}. The war in Ukraine will, of course,
dominate the summit. The conversation is poised to focus on the easy
part: getting more arms to the frontlines. But NATO also needs to take
up the hard part: when and how to marry the flow of weapons to a
diplomatic strategy aimed at producing a cease-fire and follow-on
negotiations over territory. [The urgency of making that pivot stems
from the need not just to end the death and destruction but to limit the
war's economic spillover, which could threaten the Atlantic alliance
from within by eroding solidarity and weakening the West's democratic
foundations. The conflict in Ukraine also puts on NATO's agenda a set of
additional challenges: managing the future of enlargement, channeling
Europe's growing geopolitical aspirations, and building a transatlantic
architecture that can accommodate the ever more complex and diverse
issues facing the West.]{.underline}

[the Strategic Concept did not confuse NATO's purpose with a fourth core
task of resilience and instead wove resilience throughout the
strategy]{.underline} as a core tool and competency for achieving all of
NATO's goals, and that the strategy highlight's NATO's global role, but
continues to bite off a lot to chew in the years to come.

2016, the International Board of Auditors concluded that NATO struggles
to provide commanders with required capabilities on time and [estimated
that common-funded capabilities required an average of 16 years from
development to delivery.]{.underline} The complexity of modern weapons
systems and the challenges of interoperability mean that [any active
engagement will lead to the identification of new technical requirements
for NATO]{.underline}. The alliance needs the processes and structures
in place to rapidly identify these requirements and procure solutions.
This includes giving commanders the authority to make decisions without
the lengthy consensus-building approach that may be reasonable, if slow,
in peacetime but is not effective during war.

[NATO has previously sought to improve the governance, speed, and
efficiency of its capability-delivery process.]{.underline} For example,
in 2018 NATO adopted a new governance model for common-funded
capabilities. It has undertaken efforts to enhance collaboration between
strategic commands (Allied Command Operations in Mons, Belgium and
Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, VA), called for the
exploration of alternative acquisition strategies to support technology
development, and created the Office of the Chief Information Officer to
accelerate the delivery of computer and information systems.
Furthermore, in October 2021 NATO launched the first \$1.1 billion
[Innovation Fund,]{.underline} and last month announced the creation of
the first ever [Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic]{.underline} to harness cutting-edge technologies as part of
the NATO 2030 agenda. These are valuable steps, but they [do not address
the fundamental challenge of rapidly acquiring common
capabilities.]{.underline} [There are still many residual processes
where consensus-based control is inherently prioritized over speed,
flexibility, innovation, and the deployment of prototypes at the end of
their development phases.]{.underline} NATO leaders recognize the
ongoing challenge. In a recent speech to the North Atlantic Council, the
supreme allied commander transformation, Gen. Philippe Lavigne, stressed
that one of his key priorities is to ensure the timely delivery of new
and critical capabilities, adding that "we need to change the rules and
make them work for us, not against us." But NATO leaders cannot fix this
alone --- [the alliance's 30 member nations are the ones that will have
to agree on the solution. Exploring alternatives and getting the allies
to agree on a solution will be difficult. It can happen on a NATO-wide
basis,]{.underline} or some subset of member nations can take on the
challenge and lead the effort, which may then be adopted by others.

[NATO's continued transformation in the coming years seems all but
certain; less certain is what it will transform into. The alliance has
survived this long by adapting. But unlike during previous rounds of
adaptation that involved the alliance taking on more responsibilities
and task]{.underline}s, [the coming decades---whose defining feature
will be the continued rise of China---will require a much more narrowly
focused alliance]{.underline}. For nigh on three decades, NATO had the
luxury of pondering what kind of alliance it wanted to be as it searched
for a new raison d'etre in the reduced threat environment following the
end of the Cold War. But the contrast between the 1990s and today's
deluge of challenges and threats is stark, and [NATO no longer has the
luxury of time]{.underline}.

[To ensure the alliance's future operational utility, the alliance must
embrace its original collective defense identity and look for ways to
streamline, and where possible reduce, its existing collective security
and crisis management activities.]{.underline} In addition to offloading
existing responsibilities to the EU and UN, [NATO should think twice
before taking on new mandates and avoid elevating new tasks like
resiliency or counterterrorism missions and assigning them equal
importance to Article 5. The alternative to the vision outlined here is
an alliance increasingly weighed down by a myriad of tasks, unable to
prioritize among them]{.underline}, [and lacking both the political will
and financial resources to perform its main function. An overburdened
NATO risks being unable to fulfill its chief purpose of collective
defense, thereby increasing the risk of further fracturing within the
alliance]{.underline}. The proposed course of action will by no means be
an easy one. [But it provides the best chance to guarantee that the

This week, [Nato will reveal its strategic concept]{.underline}. In
1997, the Nato summit in Madrid set the stage for the group\'s
enlargement. When the last strategic concept came out in 2009, Russia
was still being categorised as a strategic partner. [At the closing of a
20-year cycle, a new blueprint for the alliance is clearly needed. The
growing push within EU states for strategic autonomy could come in part
through a unified defence policy.]{.underline} One of the most important
preparatory meetings that Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg held
was with French President Emmanuel Macron last week. Mr Macron probed
how the strategic concept could incorporate EU ambitions. The Elysee
Palace can no longer afford to talk about the Nato alliance being
\"brain dead\". Now it says it has suffered an "electric shock" and is
demanding answers. [America's pivot to Asia is certainly not
dead.]{.underline} Indeed its move to seal Aukus, a strategic rearmament
agreement with the UK and Australia, shows that it is ambitious in the
platforms it seeks. [For now, the Europeans are not actively challenging
the US over China in the way that was true two years ago]{.underline}.
They may be seeking to end their cheap energy relationship with Russia,
but they are not altering their trade-focused relationship with Beijing.
**[Nato's efforts to flesh out a strategic outlook that straddles those
interests is going to be a key test of its thinking]{.underline}** next
week. **[How it implements that approach and sticks to it when it is
inevitably tested is one of the greatest challenges facing the
alliance.]{.underline}** With the US mid-term election looming and the
short run-up to the next presidential election, Nato is hostage to
another concern. Europeans are broadly convinced that Donald Trump
stands a good chance of being elected US president in 2024. What chance
of the alliance holding together, then, is probably best described as
slim to nil.

In the coming years, [NATO needs to balance the impetus toward being a
"liberal bulwark" with its traditional role as a defense alliance. To do
so will require a thorough understanding of the strategic
environment]{.underline}, particularly the threat posed by Russia and
the challenges posed by China. [NATO must adapt by better delineating
what aspects of security planning it is best suited to and what would be
better delegated to other institution]{.underline}s, while prioritizing
partnerships that share NATO values. As the drafting of the Strategic
Concept is being finalized and moving toward formal adoption by the NATO
allies in Madrid in June, it [is crucial to avoid the temptation to
define "resilience" as a core task. The Strategic Concept from 2010
outlined the core tasks of "collective defense," "crisis management" and
"cooperative security," but adding a fourth core task this time around
would further confuse what is core to the alliance. NATO needs to
prioritize and refocus on collective defense, its original and continued
raison d'être]{.underline}. The digital age and the significance of
political warfare is bringing about new challenges, but [the
transatlantic alliance is better off tying resilience to collective
defense as an integral part of it rather than risking the inflation of
core tasks.]{.underline}

Since 2014, [NATO has become increasingly aware of the nonmilitary
challenges to its unity and resilience but has adapted only in certain
respects. I]{.underline}t adopted the so-called baseline requirements in
2016, against which it can measure individual allies' level of
resilience regarding their provision of essential services to their
domestic populations. These basics that would be necessary to withstand
a crisis include access to food, water and energy supplies; maintenance
of core functions of government; and resilient civil transportation
systems. However, [the baseline requirements are technical
measurements]{.underline} that do not adequately grasp the political
nature of the challenges that Russia and China pose to alliance unity.
Moreover, their [focus on civil preparedness, resource management and
infrastructure does not seem to fit squarely within the competencies of
a defense alliance. NATO may be on a slippery slope with the scope of
its resilience concept drifting further away from its defense
capabilities]{.underline}.

[NATO, as an organization]{.underline} and as an alliance of states[, is
aware of the challenges to transatlantic resilience]{.underline} and
cohesion that Russia and China pose, [but the alliance has not been able
to agree on the issues to which it can bring added]{.underline} value.
The situation today stands in contrast to the situation during the Cold
War when NATO successfully calibrated resilience to the ability to
resist an armed attack by focusing on civil emergency planning. Russia
and China are illiberal challengers that add new meaning to
transatlantic security cooperation, but [NATO's adaptation will depend
on the extent to which the United States and Europe can find agreement
on investment in transatlantic security]{.underline}.

### Link -- small members key 

#### Concepts and strategies of small states develop key to risk of innovation to be diffused through alliance - aff focuses on the US 

**Kallenborn, 2022**

The NATO strategic concept should define and enhance NATO's role as an
innovation foundry. As a confederated alliance, NATO has a major
strategic advantage in granting member states the freedom to innovate
and diverge in how they make crucial defense and security decisions.
Smaller states with fewer resources need to find more effective and
efficient ways to use them. [But the concepts, policies, doctrines, and
strategies the smaller states develop may help inform the practices of
larger member states. This allows the inherent risk of innovation to be
diffused throughout the alliance.]{.underline}

### Link -- Single focus tech/ prioritization 

#### NATO requires EDT prioritization -- plan only broadly increases innovation in EDTs

**Soare, 2021**

Figuring out the added value of NATO-enabled innovation in EDTs and how
to build a sustainable and mutually reinforcing relationship with
prevalent national innovation efforts is another key element.
[Prioritization is essential in innovation efforts, particularly when
there is little certainty about what technology areas or combinations
yield sustainable strategic advantages]{.underline}. [Without discussing
the merits of every innovation effort, NATO should adopt a strategic
"systems of systems" focus on innovation in EDTs.]{.underline} [While
there is merit in strategic planning for individual technology areas,
the added value in alliance defense innovation efforts is a more applied
focus on technology convergence---what mix of new technologies deliver
the more sustainable strategic military advantage in the medium- and
long-term in the context of great-power competition.]{.underline} For
example, [the integration of AI, autonomy, and digitally enabled human
enhancement opens multiple possibilities of adversarial exploitation of
the cognitive and physical domain]{.underline}.23 Some work in this
field is ongoing, but it requires more investment, frequent iteration,
and a larger scale. In February, the Science and Technology Organization
organized a two-day tabletop exercise that explored combinations of new
technologies and their efficiency in various scenarios.24 Similarly, in
May the European Defense Agency organized a ten-day Technology Foresight
Exercise to inform the revision of the European research and capability
development priorities.25

#### \*Prioritization of implementation of Strategic Concept key to achieving objectives despite purpose of strategic concept

commitment from Alliance," 07/07/22,

accessed 07/12/22, GDI-JCR\]

Defined goals Does the strategy define clear goals? Given the function
that [the Strategic Concept]{.underline} is meant to perform, I think
the document [sets a reasonably good level of ambition, especially in
clarifying NATO's updated defense and deterrence posture and
mainstreaming resilience across all allied core tasks.]{.underline}
Where I think the concept misses an opportunity is in clarifying the
ambition of its medium to longer-term goals relating to NATO
modernization and adaptation: seizing the advantages of the ongoing
technological revolution, clarifying NATO's responsibilities in
combatting (and adapting) to climate change, and suggesting a roadmap
for engaging NATO partners, especially those in the Indo-Pacific, to
mention a few glaring examples. These may not be the priority topics of
today, but ambitious structural change is essential in ensuring the
Alliance is prepared for them tomorrow. Clear lines of effort Does the
strategy outline several major lines of effort for achieving its
objectives? Will following those lines of effort attain the defined
goals? Does the strategy establish a clear set of priorities, or does it
present a laundry list of NATO activities? [With such a long "laundry
list", prioritization will remain an issue and will likely be decided by
the art]{.underline} (and bureaucracy) [of implementation.]{.underline}
I would have loved to see more [details on the "how" of
achieving]{.underline} some of [the objectives set]{.underline}, for
instance more clarity on burden-sharing in the current environment or a
roadmap for elevating the NATO-EU partnership to the next level to
enable collaboration [especially on sub-threshold challenges such as
disinformation, resilience, or energy security.]{.underline} Realistic
implementation guidelines [Is it feasible to implement this strategy?
Are there resources available to sustain it? The]{.underline} key
[objective of the Strategic Concept is to provide high-level political
guidance]{.underline}, which it does well, [so judging on implementation
is somewhat beyond its scope.]{.underline} For what it's worth, the key
[hurdles in implementation]{.underline} in my view stem from the
economic context, specifically growing inflation and slowing gains which
[may hinder the ability to implement the force posture sought and
maintain high troop readiness levels.]{.underline} Alternatively, an
exogenous shock may also change the threat assessment within the
Alliance, and split allied focus.

### Unity key to deter China

#### China is watching to see if the unity [lasts]{.underline}

GDI-TM\]

Since taking office last year, President Joe [Biden has pursued a
strategy of restoring relationships with allies to put pressure on
Beijing]{.underline}. The [Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}
nearly two weeks ago [showed what those allies can do.]{.underline} For
[China, the speed and severity with which the U.S. and its allies
sanctioned Russia is a warning sign that could guide future economic and
foreign policy]{.underline}. Chinese officials have increased efforts to
buttress their country's self-reliance since President Donald Trump
sanctioned telecommunications giant Huawei and slapped tariffs on
billions of dollars' worth of Chinese goods. But Trump did all that
singlehandedly --- while simultaneously damaging ties with Europe and
provoking uncertainty among U.S. allies in Asia. The response to Ukraine
has been anything but a go-it-alone move by the United States. "[Given
the success that the U.S. has had in coordinating the financial
sanctions and export controls]{.underline} not just with Europe but also
with Japan, a key player in tech value chains --- this is [extremely
alarming for China]{.underline}," said Reva Goujon, senior manager for
the China corporate advisory team at Rhodium Group. "[This is a very
multilateral moment]{.underline}," Goujon said. "At a high level, you
would think China would benefit from \[the U.S.\] having a big
distraction in Europe, but actually \[this\] only accentuates those
policy debates over critical exposure and vulnerabilities to Chinese
supply chains." From Germany to Japan, many countries have joined the
U.S. in freezing the assets of Russian oligarchs, restricting access of
Russia's biggest banks to the global financial system, and cutting off
Russia from critical technology. China condemns 'unilateral' sanctions
On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the friendship between
China and Russia is "rock solid." He pointed specifically to a joint
statement between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President
Vladimir Putin last month, in which China and Russia described
"international relations entering a new era" and "no limits" to their
countries' cooperation. Beijing has refused to call Russia's attack on
Ukraine an invasion. China has focused on promoting negotiations between
Russia and Ukraine, and it opposes the economic measures that have been
taken against Russia. China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said it
"opposes all illegal unilateral sanctions." It has not elaborated on how
the sanctions against Russia, which have been imposed by many countries,
could be considered unilateral. When asked about an "alliance of Western
nations" pushing Russia out of the SWIFT banking network, Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said last week that "China does not
agree with resolving issues with sanctions, still less unilateral
sanctions that lack the basis of international law," according to an
English-language press conference transcript. Later in the week,
spokesperson Wang reiterated that position in response to a question
about whether Western sanctions on trade with Russia would affect China.
Sanctions "only create serious difficulties to the economy and
livelihood of relevant countries and further intensify division and
confrontation," he said. China's Europe balance Escalating trade
tensions between the U.S. and China in the last few years had already
accelerated Beijing's efforts to firm up ties with Europe. The Ukraine
war threatens all that. China's "balancing act" of trying to quietly
support Russia while keeping up relations with Europe is "going to be
more and more difficult. That has consequences for trade links,
primarily with the EU," said Nick Marro, global trade leader at The
Economist Intelligence Unit. Marro noted that reputational risks rise
for China "the more China tries to fudge its stance on Russia and focus
its criticism on NATO and the U.S." "China was hoping to use the EU as a
way to offset the pressure it was facing from the U.S.," Marro said.
"Right now, Europe sees Russia as an existential threat." "Right now the
impact for China \[from the sanctions\] really is secondary," Marro
said. "This conflict raises bigger questions around industrial policy
and China's diplomatic relations with the West."

NATO Secretary General JENS STOLTENBERG said last week that NATO was in
it with Ukraine for "as long as it takes." Bravo! But Stoltenberg ---
effective, intelligent, articulate, and resolute --- remains a diplomat.
[If the will from political leaders in NATO starts to
fragment]{.underline} and crumble beneath him [as economic recession
bites and Ukraine gets lost over the years]{.underline} in the mists of
the various political conversations in the 30 allied countries, [it is
questionable whether the alliance will be able to do more than prevent
spillover from the Ukraine conflict into wider Europe.]{.underline}
[That]{.underline} still counts for an awful lot, but it [doesn't count
for]{.underline} as [much]{.underline} as simultaneously [rebuffing the
strategic challenges posed by China.]{.underline} [NATO firmly rejects
the suggestion that China and Russia together are too much to
handle.]{.underline} Spokesperson OANA LUNGESCU told China Watcher:
"Both authoritarian regimes are pushing back against the international
rules-based order, so we are strengthening NATO in an era of strategic
competition and deepening our partnerships with like-minded nations
around the world, including our Indo-Pacific partners.... NATO does not
have the luxury of choosing our challenges, we must face them all."
Whether, amid the crisis in Ukraine, most European allies truly see
things as NATO HQ does is open to debate. But some of [the most
important allies do at least see a clear linkage between Ukraine and
Taiwan]{.underline}, raising hopes that VLADIMIR PUTIN's war of
aggression does not necessarily presage a narrowing of their focus into
a literal and figurative "fortress Europe." "We need to learn the
lessons of Ukraine, which was that we could have ensured that Ukraine
had the defensive capability earlier,\" Britain's Foreign Secretary LIZ
TRUSS said last week. \"And that would have done more to deter ... Putin
from invading, so-called deterrence by denial, and that is a similar
approach to the approach we need to take for other sovereign nations,
including Taiwan." I warned in a December edition of China Watcher of [a
"perfect geo-political storm" on both sides of the Eurasian landmass in
which Russia forges into Ukraine while China does something similar in
Taiwan]{.underline}. [Allies that are skeptical we can afford to meet
the China and Russia challenges simultaneously only need to consider the
consequences --- to their own economies if nothing else --- of a war
over Taiwan taking place alongside the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. If
the argument of global good citizenship or saving democracies doesn't
fly, perhaps rational self-interest will. Beijing responded to Truss's
remarks in typically indignant fashion, lodging an official complaint
with Britain for her "arrogance." But the PRC seems even more outraged
than usual since its inclusion in NATO's Strategic Concept. It looks
rattled, offering a perversely hopeful sign, perhaps, that China's
loudly and publicly vocalized remonstrations are themselves evidence
that [the U.S. and its allies are not]{.underline}, after all, [likely
to take their eye off the ball in Asia due to the crisis in Eastern
Europe.]{.underline} NATO's warming relations in the Indo-Pacific have
certainly got Beijing's attention. As proceedings in Madrid began on
June 28, for instance, China's Global Times colorfully railed, with nary
a metaphor left unmixed, against the participation at a NATO summit for
the first time of Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, saying:
"Catering to NATO\'s Asia-Pacificization is tantamount to inviting
wolves into the house.... The sewage of the Cold War cannot be allowed
to flow into the Pacific Ocean." After the summit, China's Foreign
Ministry spokesperson ZHAO LIJIAN on Friday singled out Tokyo in
particular for attempting to "spearhead NATO's foray into the
Asia-Pacific," something that would "only stoke bloc confrontation and
create antagonism and division in the region." But [it is the way in
which the fate of Taiwan and the fate of Ukraine are so closely
intertwined that is now at the heart of the matter.]{.underline}
Taiwan's leaders have had 20/20 vision on this from the start of Putin's
Feb. 24 invasion, less than a week after which President TSAI ING-WEN,
her vice president, WILLIAM LAI, and Premier SU TSENG-CHANG all agreed
to make the symbolically important move of donating a month's salary for
humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The Taiwanese people are also acutely aware
of the parallels with Ukraine, and some have even joined the ranks of
foreign fighters risking their lives to repel the Russian invasion.
Taipei, of course, was delighted at NATO's new Strategic Concept: "We
welcome NATO's global perspective," Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesperson JOANNE OU told your host on Tuesday. "Taiwan will continue
to closely work with democratic partners around the world in response to
the hybrid threat posed by authoritarian regimes." The latest assessment
of the actual threat to Taiwan of a Chinese attack came on Sunday when
Gen. MARK MILLEY, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the BBC
that "whether they would or not, it\'s a political choice, it\'s a
policy choice, that will be based off of how the Chinese view the cost
risk benefit at the time. ... There\'s no indications or warnings of
anything imminent at this time.\" Looking at events in Ukraine, that is
hardly surprising. Putin's invasion is a mess. Beijing would probably
view a war in the Taiwan Strait in which it failed to take Taipei and
only managed to take slices of the Taiwan islands as a massive public
humiliation. Add to that the prospect of a sanctions and isolation
campaign to rival the one against Moscow, and, right now at least,
Beijing has every good reason to hold back. [From wherever America's
allies around the world draw strength and inspiration to pull closer
together against Beijing's aggressive posture, staying that messy course
in Ukraine remains the best strategy to avoid a dramatic escalation in
the assault on the global order. By highlighting the need to deal with
China and Russia's growing partnership, NATO has got it right in its new
Strategic Concept. That offers no immediate relief for the people of
Ukraine, but it's probably the best news anyone can offer at this time
to the people of Taiwan.]{.underline}

[The recent 2022 Madrid NATO Summit offered a sense of how much the
world order has changed.]{.underline} If one thing is clear, it is that
Putin got the opposite of what he wanted: the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization is stronger and more united than ever. Russia has shifted
from being one of NATO's strategic partners to a major threat for the
organization and the world's stability. The main catalyst for this
current situation is its invasion over Ukraine. Rightly or wrongly,
[China is now]{.underline} also [in NATO's focus.]{.underline} In this
critical wartime summit, the organization has highlighted its support
for Ukraine in defeating the Russian troops. As an example of NATO's
upturn, Sweden and Finland are slated to become the latest members. This
wouldn't have been possible if Turkey had not dropped their threat to
veto as it did right before the summit's commencement. The justifiable
urge of the Nordics to join NATO coincides in its nature with that of
other Easter European countries: they worry about any unpredictable
assaults the Kremlin may take on their sovereignty and territorial
integrity. For this, the organization has updated the 2020 NATO
Strategic Concept paper. [The organization's new strategic concept
addresses China for the first time since its creation. NATO's Secretary
General]{.underline} Jens Stoltenberg [stated flatly and dramatically
that China has now become a "systemic challenge for Euro-Atlantic
safety."]{.underline} Stoltenberg added that while China is not NATO's
adversary, it "must be clear-eyed about the serious challenges it
represents." [The new strategic concept]{.underline}, designed as NATO's
new roadmap, [specifies that Beijing's policies "challenge the
organization's interests, security and values." The document
condemns]{.underline} "the People's Republic of [China's malicious
hybrid and cyber operations and its confrontational and disinformation
rhetoric]{.underline} \[that\] target allies and damage the alliance's
security." [NATO warns that the Chinese government is "rapidly
expanding" its nuclear capabilities]{.underline} without increasing
transparency or engaging in good faith in arms control. This is of
concern not only to NATO members, but also to neighboring countries in
Asia and Oceania, not to mention the island of Taiwan.

challenge. The Europeans would need to quickly fill those gaps. They
need to plan now how they would do so.
