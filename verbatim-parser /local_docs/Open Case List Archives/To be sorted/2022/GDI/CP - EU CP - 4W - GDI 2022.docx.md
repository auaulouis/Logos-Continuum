THE EUROPEAN PILLAR

[The war in Ukraine has been a geopolitical wake-up call for
Europe---and NATO should capitalize on this moment]{.underline}. Europe
has made numerous false starts over the years at acquiring more
geopolitical strength and responsibility, but this time, thanks to
Russia, the effort may well yield more impressive results. [Russian
aggression has already prompted Europeans to make new and substantial
investments in military capability]{.underline}. Germany has allocated
100 billion euros to upgrade its dilapidated military and has agreed to
meet NATO's benchmark of spending 2 percent of GDP on defense. Other
European nations have announced sizable increases in their defense
budgets. [Translating these investments into war-fighting capability
will take time and require coordination across national boundaries and
between NATO and the EU.]{.underline} [But these investments, and
Germany's turnaround in particular, have the potential to be a
game-changer, finally endowing Europe with the greater geopolitical heft
that that it needs in a world in which great-power rivalry is back. The
United States should keep the pressure on its allies and work with them
to take full advantage of their new readiness to shoulder greater
defense burdens]{.underline}.

[A more capable Europe will make for a stronger Atlantic
partnership.]{.underline} Democrats and Republicans alike have long
complained that NATO needs a sturdier European pillar. [Whatever party
is in power in Washington, the Atlantic link will be in better shape if
Europe brings more geopolitical heft to the table]{.underline}. [With
Russia now threatening NATO's eastern flank and tensions in the western
Pacific also putting new demands on U.S. resources, Washington will
appreciate having more European capability]{.underline}. And even though
a renewed Russian threat will keep U.S. forces in Europe for the
foreseeable future, [Europe needs to be able to act on its own when
necessary.]{.underline}

### Effective EU rebalance -- decrease US reliance 

#### Rebalance requires decrease reliance on US for collective defense, crisis management and cooperative security -- the perm increases reliance

Taken together[, these developments underscore the need for Europe and
the United States to find a new path forward]{.underline}. Europe's
long-standing aspiration to develop more effective ways to act
militarily is now intersecting with the long-standing U.S. aspiration
that Europeans shoulder more of the common burden. Stated simply,
[Europe has wanted autonomy without providing adequate defense
resources, while the United States has wanted greater European defense
contributions without diminishing NATO and U.S. political influence. Now
it is time to unite these two debates and find a new balance for
both.]{.underline}

As E[urope]{.underline} grapples with new and complex strategic
realities, it [can no longer afford its excessive reliance on the United
States, either for collective defense or for crisis management and
cooperative security missions beyond Europe's borders]{.underline}. The
U.S. will have to pay increasing attention to China and limit its
involvement in the wider Middle East. [The United States will therefore
increasingly look to European allies to shoulder more of the common
burden and encourage greater contributions to security by the European
Union.]{.underline}\[8\]

The [development of the EU's common defense policy neither entails
dividing responsibilities with regard to European security, nor pretends
to substitute the vital function that NATO fulfills]{.underline}. [The
responsibilities of the organizations that form the basis of the
trans-Atlantic security bond will remain the same. What matters is to
assume those responsibilities with all our existing
capacities.]{.underline}

The American commentator Walter Lippmann said that [alliances are like
chains: They can't be strong with weak links]{.underline}. On the eve of
NATO's 2022 Madrid summit, this is the best way to describe the
political challenge facing the trans-Atlantic relationship. [Only the
political will of Europeans and their leaders will be able to strengthen
our continent's security.]{.underline}

While Russian President Vladimir Putin's war of aggression against
[Ukraine has reinvigorated the Atlantic alliance, it has also deepened
Europe's strategic dependence on the United States.]{.underline} As
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO) allies continue to help
Ukraine beat back Russia's assault, they must also address this
important longer-term challenge of rebalancing trans-Atlantic defense.
Doing so means squaring a triangle of issues: ensuring Europe's capacity
to defend itself against Russia and manage a range of additional
crise]{.underline}s, many along its southern periphery; [addressing
European aspirations for greater strategic autonomy;]{.underline} and
[maintaining confidence that the United States can adequately uphold its
commitments in both the north Atlantic and the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.\[1\]

[Advancing greater European strategic responsibility]{.underline} starts
by defining the concept in a way designed to strengthen the Atlantic
alliance. It [should focus on two military goals]{.underline}. First[,
European allies should build their conventional military capabilities to
a level that would provide half of the forces and
capabilities]{.underline}, including the strategic enablers, [required
for deterrence and collective defense against major-power
aggression.]{.underline} Second[, European allies should develop
capabilities to conduct crisis management operations]{.underline} in
Europe's neighborhood [without today's heavy reliance on U.S.
enablers]{.underline} such as strategic lift, refueling, and command,
control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance [(C4ISR).]{.underline}

[Meeting these two goals would allow Europe to become the first
responder to most crises in its neighborhood,]{.underline} acting
through NATO, through the EU, or through ad hoc coalitions of the
willing[. It would permit the United States to shift some of its forces
and strategic focus to the Indo-Pacific region without any significant
reduction in the capabilities needed to deter Russia.]{.underline}

### Strong Europe key to deter China 

#### Internal link -- Europe needs to contribute to global deterrence of China

Institute **2022**

Invest More to Preserve the Status Quo in the Taiwan Strait" Global

Germany and [Europe]{.underline} have every [interest]{.underline} to
[work with their allies to preserve the]{.underline} peaceful [status
quo]{.underline} [in the Taiwan Strait. Doing so will require a clear
European contribution to international efforts to deter China from using
force to change the current power balance in the region]{.underline}.
Beijing needs to know that it will face extremely high costs should it
use coercion or force to realize Xi Jinping's dream of placing Taiwan
under the control of the Chinese party state. [A central piece of that
deterrence is military]{.underline}, which involves Taiwan, the US and
regional allies like Japan and Australia. However, [Germany and Europe
have a key role to play in non-military forms of
deterrence]{.underline}. Berlin and Brussels should signal to Beijing
that they would impose the most far-reaching economic sanctions
possible, including cutting China off from key technologies such as
advanced semiconductors, should Beijing start an armed conflict in the
Taiwan Strait. [To increase the credibility of this type of deterrence,
Germany and Europe will need to significantly reduce their overall
economic and technological dependence on China.]{.underline} Doing so
would have the added benefit of making Europeans much less vulnerable
not only to possible Chinese counter-sanctions in the event of a war,
but also to Chinese economic coercion in general.

With the possible exceptions of the UK and France[, European states do
not have any direct role to play in terms of militarily deterring
Beijing -- but Europe can play an indirect military role]{.underline}.
With Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the European security order has all
but crumbled. [By investing in stronger military capabilities at home,
European states can assume a greater share of providing security in
their own increasingly dangerous neighborhood. This would allow the US
to focus more on the Indo-Pacific theater despite the deterioration of
the security situation in Europe]{.underline}. At the same time,
Europeans -- together with the non-European G7 states and other allies
-- need to ensure that Beijing learns the right lessons from the
Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine and the associated sanctions. [It needs to
be clear to Xi that his ​"Chinese dream" cannot have it all and that he
faces a clear-cut choice between economic prosperity on the one hand and
a forceful take-over of Taiwan on the other.]{.underline}

At present, Germany is far from pursuing a serious and ambitious agenda
aimed at preserving peace in the Taiwan Strait. At the root of this are
fundamental misconceptions that still inform the attitudes of some
Berlin policymakers as well as the larger public discussion. Many in
Germany still view a potential Taiwan conflict as a confrontation
between the US and China in which Germany has few stakes and should
therefore strive to remain neutral. [Others harbor delusions that
Germany and Europe should act as mediators between the US and China on
Taiwan. And still more have already resigned themselves to defeatism: in
the medium term, they argue, it is impossible to prevent the Chinese
Communist party state from swallowing up Taiwan.]{.underline} After all,
they argue, the island is so close to China's mainland and cannot be
defended against an increasingly powerful and determined Chinese
military. Furthermore, according to this argument, [the US is not a
reliable protector -- it would not fight for Taiwan if Beijing were to
launch an attack. In this scenario, Taiwan would face the same fate as
Hong Kong where the US and Europe did little to challenge Beijing's
take-over by force.]{.underline}

### Europe key to deter China 

#### US Military deterrence of china not sufficient -- Europe key to non-military component of deterrence

Why It's Time for Investments in Deterrence

[The key to peace in the Taiwan Strait is deterring Beijing from
violently changing the status quo. And for deterrence to work, it will
be crucial to influence the cost-benefit calculations of the Chinese
leadership.]{.underline} The **[aim must be to persuade Beijing that
Taiwan cannot be conquered ​"at an acceptable cost."]{.underline}** [The
military component of this endeavor is the task of Taiwan, the US and
their regional allies.]{.underline} Both Taiwan and the US still have a
lot of work ahead of them to achieve success in this regard. For a long
time, Taiwan has failed to invest in the right military capabilities,
and the US has been losing ground militarily against China in the region
in recent years. But [**even a military hardening of Taiwan and a
strengthening of the military capabilitie**s]{.underline} of the US and
allies like Australia and Japan alone **[would likely not convince
Beijing's leadership that the costs of an attack on Taiwan are too
high.]{.underline}** [Only if Beijing believes that the political and
economic consequences of an attempt to conquer Taiwan pose a fundamental
threat to the]{.underline} ​"Chinese dream" and [the foundations of the
Chinese Communist Party's ​"great national rejuvenation]{.underline}"
project [will it refrain from attacking Taiwan]{.underline}. As China's
key trading partners, Germany and [Europe have a central role to play in
this non-military component of deterrence.]{.underline} The former
German Ambassador to the United Nations Christoph Heusgen, who now heads
the Munich Security Conference, summed up what is necessary: ​"Beijing
should not delude itself about the consequences of an invasion \[of
Taiwan\]. [Our possible response should be coordinated]{.underline}
within the European Union [and clearly communicated]{.underline}. This
is not about military intervention -- there are other options for
sanctions. Beijing should know that it will not be treated as leniently
as it was after the Hong Kong takeover."

### EU CP/Strategic Autonomy -- solves Chinese deterrence

#### Increasing European defense capabilities contribute to deterring China -- frees up US resources 

**Benner,** co-founder and director of the Global Public Policy
Institute **2022**

[A German contribution to a non-military deterrence of Beijing is
especially crucial for maintaining a peaceful status quo in the Taiwan
Strait.]{.underline} This must also be a key element of the German
Federal Foreign Office's upcoming China strategy as well as Germany's
first-ever national security strategy, which is set to be adopted by
late 2022[. In military terms, Germany should not aspire to a
significant role in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, except when
participating in freedom of navigation operations (FONOP) and
intensifying defense cooperation with other allies in the region.
Instead[, Berlin should focus on finally beefing up its efforts to
provide security in its own increasingly troubled
neighborhood]{.underline}. **[Increasing European defense capabilities
would also be an important contribution to deterring
Beijing.]{.underline}** Observers have noted that the US cannot fight a
war on two fronts in both Europe and Asia -- one against Russia and one
against China. [If Europeans can more effectively provide conventional
and eventually also nuclear deterrence in their own region, the US can
focus its efforts on the Indo-Pacific theater. And the more the US can
concentrate on the Indo-Pacific, the more credible its military
deterrence vis-à-vis Beijing becomes.]{.underline} [Europe and the US
need to prepare for the scenario of a possible two-front war in which
Russia challenges NATO in Europe (or helps China by engaging Japan in
the Indo-Pacific) while Beijing launches an assault on
Taiwan.]{.underline} Brussels and Washington also need to coordinate on
how to respond to any coercive measures short of war that Beijing can --
and will -- use to put pressure on Taiwan.

[Russia's further invasion of Ukraine and its efforts to upend Europe's
security order are the most vivid and dramatic evidence of this new
era's challenge]{.underline}s. Until now, [Putin's pressures have united
the Atlantic alliance]{.underline}. [Unity could give way to
discord]{.underline}, however, [if Europeans don't assume a stronger
role in deterring/defending against Russia,]{.underline} with the
capabilities to match[, and if the United States continues to impede a
European lead role in crisis management]{.underline}. [It is time for
the U.S. and Europe to shed their mutual ambivalence and work together
to make strategic autonomy]{.underline} --- [defined as greater
strategic responsibility --- a win-win for both sides of the
Atlantic.]{.underline}

### EDF good

Finally, [another important step in developing defence and military
capabilities at the EU level has been the implementation]{.underline} of
the European Defence Fund ([EDF)]{.underline} that was created in 2017
to [address collective shortages in defence procurement and
research.]{.underline}80 [Currently, EU member states each pursue their
own capability development and acquisition programmes primarily on a
national level, leading to fragmentation, duplication of effort,
industrial inefficiencies and reduced interoperability]{.underline}. The
[EDF aims to pool member states' resources to increase investment
efficiency in defence capability. The EDF is significant because it is
the first time that the EU budget will be used to fund defence
activities explicitly, including defence research and co-funding
capability development projects.]{.underline} The EDF uses existing
budget lines within the EU budget to defence funding for the first time
rather than asking for additional contributions from EU member states.81
According to the final funding plan that was laid out by the Commission,
[the budget will be split between defence research projects, and
subsequently co-funded capability development projects between member
states]{.underline}. However, their financial contributions will remain
voluntary.82

[NATO has shown itself to be indispensable for Europe's
security]{.underline} and the best guarantee of their national security
for a growing number of countries. [One of the most important
consequences of the war in Ukraine has been Finland and
Sweden's]{.underline} applications to join NATO --- two countries with
all the credentials to contribute positively to the alliance. Following
Danish citizens' recent decision to join the European Union's defense
policy, [the institutions that form the basis of European security are
becoming increasingly aligned. For decades, a false dichotomy between
Europeanists and Atlanticists has fueled a sterile and unproductive
security debate in Europe]{.underline}. Today, [few doubt that Europeans
must contribute more to the alliance and European security, and that
they should develop the capacity to lead in future security
crises.]{.underline} [The question]{.underline}, therefore, [is how
Europe can best contribute to NATO's mission. A strong Europe is
indispensable for revitalizing the trans-Atlantic security
bond]{.underline}. In one of my first meetings as EU high representative
for foreign affairs and security policy, a former British chief of the
defense staff pertinently described the direction this relationship
should take. "A Europe that remains allied with the United States simply
because of its own weakness," he said, "is of limited value."
[Strengthening the trans-Atlantic relationship implies recognizing that
its European component has changed]{.underline}. The events of recent
months have shown that the EU can respond to security threats in a
coordinated and robust manner. Extensive sanctions against Russia, joint
financing of arms supplies to Ukraine, and the mere idea of drastically
reducing Europe's dependence on Russian energy would have been
unthinkable just a few years ago. [The European response to Russia's
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, after the measures the continent
adopted to mitigate the economic consequences of COVID-19, [has
confirmed that Europe becomes stronger]{.underline} in times of
adversity. True, Russian President Vladimir [Putin's aggression has made
it easier for Europe to unite]{.underline}. But its leaders' ambition is
noteworthy, given some of the measures' economic costs to Europe. **[The
basis for advancing European defense integration already exists.
Progress in the past 20 years in common security and defense policy, the
experience of both civil and military EU missions, the work of the
European Defense Agency, and the adoption of the Strategic Compass put
Europe in a favorable position to confront the challenge.]{.underline}**
