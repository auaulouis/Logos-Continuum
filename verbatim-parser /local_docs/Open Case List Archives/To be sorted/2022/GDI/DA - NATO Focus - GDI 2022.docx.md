**[[NATO's]{.mark} continued [transformation]{.mark} in the coming years
[seems a]{.mark}ll but [certain; less certain is what it will transform
into]{.mark}. The alliance has survived this long by adapting. But

luxury of pondering what kind of alliance it wanted to be as it searched
for a new raison d'etre in the reduced threat environment following the

**[Get ready for the "terrible 2020s": a period in which China has
strong incentives to grab "lost" land and break up
coalitions]{.underline}** seeking to check its advance. [**[Beijing
possesses grandiose territorial aims]{.underline}** **[as well as a
strategic culture that emphasizes hitting first]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[and hitting hard when it perceives gathering dangers. It has a host
of wasting assets]{.underline}** in the form of military advantages that
may not endure beyond this decade. **[[Such dynamics have driven China
to war in the past and could do so again today]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[If conflict does break out]{.mark}, U.S. officials should not be
sanguine about how it would end]{.underline}**. Tamping or **[[reversing
Chinese aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Western Pacific
**[[could require a massive use of force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An
authoritarian CCP, always mindful of its precarious domestic legitimacy,
would not want to concede defeat even if it failed to achieve its
initial objectives. And historically, modern wars between great powers
have more typically gone long than stayed short. All of this implies
that **[[a U.S.-China war could be incredibly dangerous, offering few
plausible off-ramps and severe pressures for
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[[The U.S. and its friends can]{.mark} take steps to [deter the
PRC]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as drastically speeding the acquisition
of weaponry and prepositioning military assets in the Taiwan Strait and
East and South China Seas, among other efforts, to showcase its hard
power and ensure that China can't easily knock out U.S. combat power in
a surprise attack. At the same time, **[calmly firming up multilateral
plans]{.underline}**, involving Japan, Australia, and potentially India
and Britain, for responding to Chinese aggression could make Beijing
realize how costly such aggression might be. If Beijing understands that
it cannot easily or cheaply win a conflict, it may be more cautious
about starting one.

**[Most of [these steps are not technologically difficult]{.mark}: [They
exploit capabilities that are available today. Yet they require an
intellectual shift---a realization that]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies need to rapidly shut China's windows of
military opportunity]{.mark},]{.underline}** which means preparing for a
war that could well start in 2025 rather than in 2035. And that, in
turn, requires a degree of political will and urgency that has so far
been lacking.

China's historical warning signs are already flashing red. Indeed,
taking the long view of why and under which circumstances China fights
is the key to understanding just how short time has become for America
and the other countries in Beijing's path.

Washington --- and]{.underline}** with it, the

everything]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[thereby fulfilling the old adage
that, "[When everything is a priority, nothing is a priorit]{.mark}y."

**[strong]{.underline}**. It **[is easy to understand

**[[calls for]{.mark} the transatlantic alliance to reinforce and

For far too long now, **[[alliance leaders have tasked the NATO military
infrastructure with a seemingly impossible undertaking: weighing down
the military organization with new
responsibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** like peacekeeping and
counter-terrorism while simultaneously allowing members to shirk on
contributing the resources required to fulfill old and new alliance
missions. To date, much of the criticism surrounding NATO's current
strategic deadlock has focused on the resource issue and the strains
caused by uneven burden-sharing within the alliance. Far [**[less
attention has been paid to the first part of the "ends-means-ways"
formulation of strategy, namely NATO's original
purpos]{.underline}**e]{.mark}. While addressing "means" and "ways" are
crucial elements in any strategic enterprise, [**[it is past time the
Allies got around to focusing on NATO's strategic ends]{.underline}**
once]{.mark} more.

**[Confronting NATO's present strategic dilemma will require looking
beyond existing strategic documents]{.underline}** like the 1949 North
Atlantic Treaty, which proclaimed the signatories' commitment to the
"preservation of peace and security" in the North Atlantic area. As the
past three decades of NATO transformation have shown, **[there is not
much that does not fit under the rubric of fostering "peace and
security" and consequently cannot be tacked onto the alliance's agenda.
[True strategy requires setting (and adhering to) actual goals and
priorities]{.mark},]{.underline}** as well as developing plans to
achieve them. Although the alliance's past strategic documents have
often sought to define NATO's evolving strategic purpose with more
precision than the founding treaty, the alliance has not adopted a new
strategic concept since 2010 for fear that embarking on such an exercise
would only further inflame the deep rifts within the alliance that such
strategic endeavors are meant to help address.

**[[Biden is]{.mark} undoubtedly [right that the Chinese challenge
overshadows all others]{.mark},]{.underline}** despite unresolved
debates in Washington over exactly when that challenge will become most
severe. **[[His administration has made major moves in the]{.mark}
Sino-American [competition]{.mark}]{.underline}** during its first
year---**[[expanding multilateral military
planning]{.underline}]{.mark}** and exercises in the western Pacific,
**[[focusing bodies such as NATO]{.mark} and the G-7 [on Beijing's
belligerence, and launching the AUKUS partnership]{.mark}]{.underline}**

resembling a respite on other fronts.

DAN KURTZ-PHELAN

So looking ahead to the Madrid summit in late June, presumably Finland
and Sweden will be one big piece of business that you all will focus
on---but so will the unveiling of a new strategic concept. If we looked
back a year ago, the conversation about NATO was what role it would play
in U.S. competition with China. And you wrote a great piece for Foreign
Affairs with Torrey Tausig a couple of years ago called "The Old World
and the Middle Kingdom" about what role Europe and the transatlantic
alliance should play in competition with China broadly. **[To what
extent does NATO have any capacity or any real role when it comes to
what is probably still the major security competition of our time and
the biggest geopolitical challenge for the United States, and that's
China]{.underline}**?

JULIE SMITH

Well, there's some good news here, and that is that for the first time
in its history, **[in 2019 NATO conducted a China review where it
stepped back and tried to better understand how China can challenge the
security of the alliance and the degree to which NATO should turn its
attention to China, both just in itself as a competitor a systemic
rival---but also how NATO should cope with China's increasing activities
and presence in the Euro-Atlantic area]{.underline}**. And so that was
step one. Step two in terms of a **[[turning point for the
alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}** was the language that you saw in the
communiqué that came out of the summit that happened last summer**[, in
2021,]{.underline}** where **[[NATO talked about China threatening the
rules-based order. That was a turning point because normally in NATO
documents China doesn't merit a mention]{.mark},]{.underline}** and in
fact in the last strategic concept, which was released in 2010, there's
no mention of China whatsoever.

Now, fast forward to this Madrid summit that's coming up at the end of
June: **[[there will be a new strategic concept. You're going to see
significantly altered language as it relates to
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** for all the obvious reasons. And if folks
are listening and would like an interesting homework project, just pull
up the 2010 strategic concept and look at the language on Russia---it's
radically different from the environment that we find ourselves in
today. It's the language---it's much more hopeful. You're going to see a
different tone as it relates to Russia. But what my prediction is, is
that **[[you will also see mention of China in the strategic concept,
and there we're going to be talking about China.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

But also what's been interesting in the last few months is to look at
the China-Russia relationship more closely, because it wasn't more than
a couple of months back when we saw the two come out and issue this big
statement on their no-limits partnership. The two actually had a joint
statement on NATO enlargement. So that's a change---**[[you see China
parroting Russia's messages on Ukraine]{.mark}, you've seen some joint
exercises with the two of them---that relationship is evolving and
there's more of a strategic alignment than we've seen in recent
years.]{.underline}** And for that reason, **[[NATO is going to have to
respond]{.underline}]{.mark}** to that, **[and talk about the tools it
needs and the resources it needs to cope with that particular challenge
again in the Euro-Atlantic area. So this is part of the conversation
despite the fact that Russia remains front and center.]{.underline}**

DAN KURTZ-PHELAN

You are preparing for what may be the most notable NATO summit in many
years, if not in decades, and Madrid in late June, but I want to start
by going back to a piece you wrote for Foreign Affairs before another
rather notable NATO summit in 2018.

The question then was what President Trump was going to do---would he
deny the United States' Article 5 commitments to defend its allies in
NATO, would he attack our allies, would he withdraw from NATO. You noted
in that piece the limits of what NATO could accomplish without real U.S.
leadership, and there were of course fears during the Trump
administration that NATO itself would wither. You then arrived at NATO
headquarters as the new ambassador in November 2021. To what extent had
the actions of the previous administration really affected the alliance?
What was the estate of the alliance and the state of U.S. credibility
within the alliance when you got to NATO?

JULIE SMITH

Well, I think when I arrived, first and foremost, the mission had been
without an ambassador for quite some time. And it was also recovering
from two years of operating during a pandemic where many people actually
had not been working remotely and had been coming into the office every
day, so it was a team that was eager to get back to work in a kind of
semi post-COVID environment, although we still grapple with COVID. And
it was a mission that was eager to actually have an ambassador in the
seat. In terms of the last administration there was a sense that
President **[Trump's comments,]{.underline}** both during the campaign
in 2016 and after his arrival in the Oval Office, **[did call into
question America's role in the NATO alliance.]{.underline}**
Traditionally, America has a very unique position in the alliance.
America leads, always has led, inside NATO. And at the time, in the last
administration, we had a president that during the campaign had actually
called into question whether or not America's Article 5 commitments
could be contingent on countries' ability to meet the target of spending
2 percent of GDP on their defense. **[And laying out the Article 5
commitment as more of a transactional operation definitely spooked the
herd and created a lot of uncertainty about America's
intention]{.underline}**s, what President Trump wanted to do during his
tenure as it related to the alliance, open-ended questions about whether
or not he would even attend some future summits.

Now, at the end of the day, some of what he had suggested on the
campaign didn't actually turn out to be how he pursued or approached
NATO in practice. But there was a sense that it was time for a reset. By
the time I arrived, again, I was excited to try and lift up the team,
lift up morale, **[[try to send a clear signal on President Biden's
determination to revitalize alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and ever
since then that has definitely been my focus and the focus of the entire
mission. And frankly I think I think we've done a good job, because
**[[we're now in a position where we've seen unprecedented levels of
unity and we're in a situation where the allies are clearly radiating
and projecting a common sense of resolve as it relates to Russia and
Ukraine.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Strategic foresight **[[Survival and success]{.mark} also [depend on
having the right strategy]{.mark}, but obtaining such a thing is
difficult.]{.underline}** Some scholars, aware of the bureaucratic and
political blinkers that impede clear thinking, have bemoaned the
'forgotten' or 'lost' art of strategy-making. Others have pointed to
strategy's illusory nature, given its application to circumstances that
are usually too unpredictable and too complex to produce the intended
results. Despite these obstacles, strategy is ubiquitous. **[No
organisation]{.underline}** - whether a government, a military, a
company or, indeed, an alliance **[-- can in good conscience face the
world without one. Whatever its limitations, strategy is better than the
alternatives:]{.underline}** taking a shot in the dark, relying on
primordial concepts such as honour, reputation and glory, or falling
back on habit and path-dependent thinking. Good strategy needs to be
constantly adjusted to changing circumstances. It also needs to be
appreciative of what is possible (not just what is desirable), and
conscious of the resources necessary to meet specified objectives. Above
all, as Sir Lawrence Freedman has argued, to adopt a strategy is to
embrace choice; it is a recognition that the environment an actor faces
can be tamed and not simply allowed to run amok. **[[NATO sits
reasonably well within this understanding]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Throughout its history, **[the [Alliance has paid considerable attention
to formulating and agreeing strategy, and then coordinating Allied
efforts]{.mark} on the basis of constantly updated concepts, political
guidance, and military doctrine.]{.underline}** [**[These efforts often
assume enormous political significance]{.underline}**.]{.mark} The 1967
Harmel Report on 'The Future Tasks of the Alliance', according to one
assessment, rescued NATO from 'the most severe crisis in its history'
following France's departure from the Alliance's integrated military
structures. The 1990 London Declaration and the 1991 Strategic Concept
were similarly pathbreaking and helped NATO transition into the
post-Cold War period. **[[These precedents mean NATO's]{.mark} more
recent top-level documents]{.underline}** -- **[the [Strategic
Co]{.mark}ncepts]{.underline}** of 1999 and 2010 as well as the
**[anticipated update of 2022 -- [come freighted with huge significance.
Externally, they are NATO's public face on the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**: key statements of relevance and purpose.
**[Internally, [they are important exercises in consensus building among
the Allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But while significant in their own
right**[, the Strategic Concepts are only one expression of NATO's
strategic coherence. Beneath them sit obscure, often classified but,
nonetheless, operationally significant statements of
purpose]{.underline}**. In recent years such documents have been adopted
at pace. In 2019, NATO approved a new Military Strategy, and in 2020 two
implementing documents - a Concept for the Deterrence and Defence of the
Euro-Atlantic Area and a Warfighting Capstone Concept. In 2021, the
Allies agreed to action plans on climate change and Women, Peace and
Security, as well as a 'Strengthened Resilience Commitment' and a cyber
defence policy. An 'Overarching Space Policy' followed in January 2022.
**[[NATO is due to formally adopt its new Strategic Concept at the
Madrid summit in June 2022]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The draft is already
being reworked in light of the Ukraine crisis. It seems likely also that
**[the NATO Military Strategy will end up with a revamp shortly
after.]{.underline}**

As the United States and the world begins to adjust to a Biden
presidency, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (**[[NATO]{.mark})
once again [finds itself at a crossroads]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Diplomats and transatlantic supporters on both sides of the Atlantic
collectively expelled a sigh of relief last November that a second Trump
term ---which many feared might spell the end of the 72-year-old
alliance---had not come to pass. However, **[the mood is far from
celebratory in either Washington or European capitals because [all
parties understand that, to steer clear of irrelevancy and remain "fit
for purpose," NATO needs renewal]{.mark}]{.underline}**---the question
is how?1

**[[If the allies are not]{.mark} careful, domestic contentions and
international [disputes]{.mark} over trade and technology regulation
[could consume their political energy, breaking the promise of
transatlantic renewal]{.mark}]{.underline}** before it has even begun.
**[[To stave off this dim prospect, NATO is embarking on a strategy of
transatlantic renewal, the centerpiece of which will be a new Strategic
Concept]{.mark}---]{.underline}**its first in a decade. NATO's current
Strategic Concept dates back to 2010 and reflects NATO's thinking on how
to cope with the divisive nature of the War on Terror, and it is
inadequate for a changed world of great power rivalry. **[[A new
Strategic Concept has long been on the agenda]{.mark} in the corridors
of NATO diplomacy, but no one dared open this Pandora's Box during the
Trump presidency]{.underline}**.

#### Increased troops deployed

Strengthening NATO on Its Eastern Flank

On the eve of the fall of the Berlin Wall, 400,000 troops from NATO
countries were stationed in West Germany (60 per cent of them American),
plus Bundeswehr forces, as well as 60,000 U.S. troops deployed elsewhere
in Europe. **[While it is unlikely that NATO will deploy a comparable
number of troops to its eastern flank (including the three Baltic
states, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania), [there has
been a significant increase in the number of troops]{.mark} in these
countries.]{.underline}**

Since the Russian invasion, the Pentagon has acknowledged that it must
change its defence posture in Europe to increase permanent troop
stationing, but also rotational deployments to deal with Russia. **[[An
additional 14,000 U.S. troops have been sent to the Baltics, Poland and
Hungar]{.mark}y, for a total of 100,000]{.underline}**

**[U.S. troops in Europe, up from 80,000 before the war]{.underline}**.
The Pentagon also repositioned troops and equipment: 800 soldiers left
Italy for the Baltics, 20 Apache helicopters went from Germany to the
Baltics, 12 from Greece to Poland and 8 F-35s were transferred from
Germany to Lithuania, Estonia and Romania. This is in addition to the
12,000 U.S. troops on alert as part of NATO\'s 40,000-strong NATO
Response Force (NRF).

**[In terms of deployment, [Britain has almost doubled the number of
troops]{.mark} in Estonia from 900 to 1,700.]{.underline}** The number
of armoured vehicles will increase to 48 and tanks to 24. Also, 350
soldiers will be added to the 100 already present in Poland. Two British
ships also joined the eastern Mediterranean in February to conduct
monitoring operations alongside other NATO members.
**[[France]{.mark},]{.underline}** which is leading the Very High
Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF) this year, has announced that it
**[[will lead a new NATO battalion]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Romania. To
this end, 250 French soldiers (the final number is expected to be twice
as many) have recently taken up position on a Romanian base near the
Ukrainian border. At the end of February 2022, Italy confirmed the
deployment of about 1,350 military personnel in Hungary and Latvia
within the framework of NATO, the dispatch of 130 military personnel and
12 combat aircraft to Romania, as well as 235 personnel, 2 ships and a
combat aircraft in the Black Sea. In recent days, Berlin has also
announced the upcoming deployment of several hundred troops to the
Alliance\'s eastern flank: 350 soldiers are to join the 500 German
troops already present in Lithuania; several ships are to be deployed in
the Baltic Sea in the near future; a Patriot missile battery will be
deployed in Slovakia and integrated into a NATO battle group similar to
those in the Baltic States. Germany also plans to deploy half a dozen
Eurofighter aircraft to Slovakia. As for Canada, on February 22, before
the invasion began, Prime Minister Trudeau had already announced the
deployment of 460 additional troops to reinforce the alliance in Eastern
Europe. This includes an artillery unit of about 100 soldiers in Latvia,
which will join 540 other members of the Armed Forces leading a NATO
battle group (Operation REASSURANCE), as well as a second frigate -- the
HMCS Halifax -- and a CP-140 Aurora patrol aircraft.

**[[Currently, there are nearly 25,000 military personnel from NATO
member countries deployed on the Alliance\'s eastern flank]{.mark}, not
counting the national armies of the eight countries that make up the
Alliance. A year ago, however, there were barely half that number. [This
number is likely to increase in the coming months]{.mark}, especially if
the conflict continues.]{.underline}** This, together with the desire of
Sweden and Finland to join NATO, raises the question of a possible
reorganization of the Alliance\'s structures.

DAN KURTZ-PHELAN But part of that was underestimating the Ukrainians,
not just overestimating the Russians. I mean, I think the rest of us
were surprised as well by the extent of the European reaction,
especially probably the German reaction, in the days after the invasion.
And, you know, contrary to recent history, in many cases we saw the
Europeans moving faster and going farther than the Americans were
prepared to at certain points when it came to sanctions and other
things. Did that surprise you? JULIE SMITH Yes. As an old Europe hand, I
will tell you that there have been countless surprises in the last
couple of months. I've kind of described it as the impossible becomes
possible, and we could talk about Germany in just a second. But there
have been so many other twists and turns in how Europe has responded.
We've had the Swiss freezing assets in ways that we just haven't seen;
we've had Norway turn its longstanding policy on not sending weapons to
parties to a war to a conflict turning that policy on its head, and now
Norway's providing lethal assistance to Ukraine. We've had the European
Union in a "peace facility" decide to allocate two billion dollars worth
of assistance towards security assistance to Ukraine---I never thought I
would see something like that, I think many of us were surprised, but
also enthusiastic about that decision by the EU. And then, yes, the
Germany piece is perhaps most surprising of all. Again, if you had told
me a year ago that it would be this particular coalition, which is
delicate and complicated, with social democrats in the lead, that this
working with the greens and the FDP, if you would have these three
coalition partners go out three days after Russia goes into Ukraine and
make this grand announcement about Germany meeting its commitment on
spending 2 percent of GDP investing more in their defense, providing
assistance, lethal assistance, to Ukraine quite openly, I would have
told you that you were dreaming. So this has been a remarkable moment in
transatlantic history, but also European history and the history of
individual allies. And what Germany decided to do, what Chancellor
Scholz decided to do, has had a significant impact on the thinking in
other national capitals. I can't tell you how many times other NATO
allies have come up to us and said, well, you know, wow, Berlin's taking
these really bold decisions, we're going to take a fresh look at our
policy on X, Y, and Z. It varies by country. But there's been this
element of inspiration in bold thinking. And I think we have to be
grateful that Berlin took this decision and has in fact pushed others to
be as bold in other categories**[.]{.underline}** So yeah, it's been
really remarkable to watch this story unfold in terms of the response to
February 24. And people like to write these stories and issue last rites
on transatlantic unity, and there are a number of stories floating
around right now. But that is not the story. Of course we disagree. Of
course we have different perspectives. That's what working at NATO is
all about, that's how you work in multilateral organizations: there are
debates, **[but it [is a story of unity and resolve]{.mark},
fundamentally, and I think [we will look back on this moment]{.mark}, on
this period of time, [as a pivotal moment in the transatlantic
relationship]{.mark}.]{.underline}** DAN KURTZ-PHELAN **[What worries
you about keeping that unity together and sustaining that resolve over
time]{.underline}**? And, I mean, even taking your point, **[there
certainly are reasons to think it's going to be hard to maintain that
given the political costs]{.underline}**---the risks, food prices,
energy prices, everything else. What concerns you, and what can be done
to sustain that? JULIE SMITH Well, look, **[[maintaining unity takes
work, and nobody can step back and assume that the level of unity that
we have right now is sustainable]{.mark} over, let's say, many, many
months or y[ears. So we will continue to work with our allies to address
the issues now that are bubbling to the surfac]{.mark}e]{.underline}**.
**[There's a broader set of issues now at play above and beyond the war
in Ukraine. There are concerns around the world about food security,
which we're spending a lot of time on]{.underline}**. There are concerns
about energy prices and the decisions that have just recently been made
in the European union as it relates to their reliance on Russian oil and
gas. And there are broader concerns in the wake of the pandemic just
about the global economy and how the war is going to impact our
societies, our publics, and public opinion on this war. Right now, **[I
think most [Europeans understand the severity]{.mark} of the situation,
the seriousness of this, and the reason why we all have to hold the line
and work together to support Ukraine in this moment---what it represents
above and beyond the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. That [it says
a lot about the future of the rules-based order]{.mark}, it says a lot
about democracy, it says a lot about territorial integrity and
sovereignty. And so we will have to keep working at it.]{.underline}**

Although tensions remain, **[the [Russian invasion succeeded in creating
a strong understanding and coordination between the Allies, even
contributing to the emergence of consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[(**[still precarious]{.underline}**]{.mark}, however) on the internal
political scenes of the member states (Part I). **[[Several measures to
strengthen NATO\'s capabilities were thus quickly decided and
implemented]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Part II), such as **[increases in
the defence]{.underline}** budgets of several countries and the
**[deployment of new troops]{.underline}** in Eastern Europe. Moreover,
we are witnessing the definitive settlement of the question of the 2% of
GDP to be invested in defence: this amount can no longer be contested,
at least not without significant political risks for its opponents. The
developments at work will therefore bring about possible changes within
NATO, more precisely with regard to its military hierarchy and the
different positions that make it up (Part III). **[[This does
not]{.mark}, however, [negate certain]{.mark} risks (Part III) in the
short and medium term for the organization, in particular in the event
of a prolonged conflict.]{.underline}** Since the invasion also has
repercussions for the EU and China, given the Alliance\'s links with the
former and its concerns about the latter, although the focus is on NATO,
this report will deal with these two aspects in a final part (Part IV).

**[[NATO\'s return to strength is undeniable]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
including vis-à-vis other organizations such as the European Union. It
is part of a new context created by the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
that of a new \"Cold War\" rather than a Third World War. Certainly,
several characteristics differ between this new \"Cold War\" and the
political and international context that prevailed between 1949 and
1989. Nevertheless, **[it remains true that [there is once again a power
across the Arctic and east of Europe that clearly represents a threat to

I. A Newfound Cohesion

Although there have been a few false notes since February 24, it is
quite surprising to see how harmonious the orchestra played by the
members of the Alliance is, especially when one analyzes the behaviour
of certain countries such as the United States, France, the United
Kingdom, and Turkey. Even if certain rivalries remain, **[most of the
[major countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- especially those that have
distinguished themselves in recent years by controversial or even
questionable actions or measures -- **[[are]{.mark} each [taking]{.mark}
their share of [responsibility and are succeeding]{.mark} for the moment
[in acting in concert]{.mark} (]{.underline}**or at least in giving this
impression for the most part). **[[This newfound cohesion is also
present in the national political scenes]{.mark} of the member
states.]{.underline}** In more than one country, the political positions
of certain anti-NATO, anti-American or pro- Russian political parties
have been greatly attenuated. Other political movements that were not
previously suspected of being sympathetic to the EU and NATO are tending
to take public positions in favour of them.

A Faded American Leadership

While the debacle in Afghanistan and the AUKUS affair revealed an
absence of leadership on the part of the United States and the new Biden
administration, **[the Russian-Ukrainian war constitutes in this respect
a reactivation of the latter within the transatlantic
community]{.underline}**. Although one cannot speak of Leading from
Behind**[, the [management by the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and the strong roles it is leaving in this crisis to
some of its allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- in particular the United
Kingdom, France, and Poland -- **[[is quite
singular]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While **[Washingto]{.underline}**n
naturally remains the primus inter pares within the Alliance, its
**[current management favours the prominence of London, Paris, and
Warsaw on this issue, [and in so doing succeeds in increasing the
effects of]{.mark} drive and [cohesion within the
Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Major NATO countries recommitted to NATO post invasion 

**[Borzillo, 2022]{.underline}**

\[Laurent, "The Resurrection of Lazarus, or the Second Youth of NATO:
The Consequences of the Russian Invasion on NATO" Policy Report Network

accessed 6.16.2022 GDI-TM\]

**[While the United States has been pursuing its strategy of pivoting
towards the Pacific for more than ten years, the [Russian invasion has
clearly suspended this movement]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with troops once
again being sent to Europe. Over the past month, several American
statements have helped to reaffirm the American commitment to the
defence of Europe in the face of the threat posed by Moscow. For its
part, **[[contrary to its long-standing reputation as a reluctant ally
within NATO, Paris has taken several measures in favour of the
Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Taking advantage of the French
presidency of the Council of the European Union, President Macron has
taken on the role of coordinating the Europeans with the Ukrainian
president, but also, at Zelensky\'s request, a contact role with the
Russian president. Although some voices continue to criticize the French
position, although still advocating for European strategic autonomy,
Paris has so far managed to avoid distinguishing itself negatively from
its allies, while assuming a leadership role on a European scale in
partnership with other capitals. However, this role is somewhat
neglected in the final phase of the campaign for the French presidential
election. Yet, it is likely to become stronger again after the election
(if Emmanuel Macron is re-elected). At the same time, the war in Ukraine
offers Boris Johnson the opportunity to put forward London\'s leadership
on an issue it has championed since 2014. The agreement between the UK,
Poland and Ukraine reached days before the British invasion (though
still in the making) is a **[[demonstration of Britain\'s commitment to
remain]{.mark},]{.underline}** in the words of the Integrated Review,
**[[\"the key European ally in NATO.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Consensus on need to maintain NATO -- Germany and Italy prove 

**[Borzillo, 2022]{.underline}**

\[Laurent, "The Resurrection of Lazarus, or the Second Youth of NATO:
The Consequences of the Russian Invasion on NATO" Policy Report Network
for Strategic Analysis April 2022 - Issue 17 google Scholar -- UT
accessed 6.16.2022 GDI-TM\]

A New Consensus

**[A [certain consensus is also emerging on the Russian threat and the
need to maintain NATO]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Despite the strength of
the Trumpist current, support for Ukraine is one of the rare points
where there is still consensus in the United States, even if the
modalities of this support remain debated. In France, the Russophile and
pro-Kremlin rhetoric -- including that of several major candidates in
the presidential election -- tends to be forgotten, masked, or at least
strongly attenuated, the entire political class condemning Russian
aggression.

Traditionally, **[[Germany had always]{.mark} been a reliable and
faithful member of the Alliance]{.underline}**. However, the arrival in
power of a government comprising the SPD and the Greens raised fears
that this position would change, with some members of these two parties
being fiercely critical of both NATO and nuclear weapons. Although there
are still dissenting voices, **[the [Russian invasion has put an end to
any strong questioning of this characteristic feature of German defence
poli]{.mark}cy]{.underline}** in recent decades. Thus, a strong
consensus in favour of the Alliance is now returning, despite the
absence of the Christian Democrats of the CDU/CSU in government.

Similarly**[, [Italy]{.mark}, which used to be ambivalent about its
relationship with Russia, [has now become aware that Russia can no
longer be a reliable partner]{.mark} on the international scene, and now
seems to be fully asserting its Europeanist and transatlantic
identity,]{.underline}** which guides its foreign policy and defence
choices. If initially the main pro-Russian and anti-militarist party,
the 5-Star Movement, did not want to explicitly name Russia as
responsible at the beginning of the conflict, it now fully supports the
government on sanctions against the country as well as on the increase
of military personnel within NATO on the eastern front.

DAN KURTZ-PHELAN

I think it's fair to say, without rendering judgment on the wisdom or
not of the basic policy decision, that the **[withdrawal from
Afghanistan had also undermined trust in the alliance and there were
certainly lots of complaints from U.S. allies---especially NATO
allies---about U.S. communication]{.underline}** about the way that
unfolded. What was the state of the conversation about Afghanistan
withdrawal, and what were the lessons that you and the rest of your team
took from that as you went into the Ukraine decision?

JULIE SMITH

Yeah, you're right. **[In the fall of 2021 there was some increased
tension across the alliance over the decision by the United States to
withdraw from Afghanistan]{.underline}**. **[Some allies had raised
concerns about the way in which the United States had consulted on that
decision]{.underline}**. **[Some allies felt that they hadn't been
consulted enough on that particular decision. And we also had in the
fall of last year some fallout over AUKUS]{.underline}** in particular.
So when I arrived in late November, early December, what was happening
[**[already was a very intense effort to return to the practice of
intense consultations]{.underline}**. **[And what we did in those final
weeks of 2021 all the way up to the present day is a very concerted
effort to ensure that at every turn, whether it's on particular U.S.
policy decisions or our views on a NATO-related matter, we have doubled
down on consultations across the alliance]{.underline}**]{.mark}---and
**[we've heard [some allies say we've never seen consultation like this
throughout the history of the NATO alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So
there does seem to be now an appreciation that the United States is
making a good faith effort, and **[whether it's the nuclear posture
review or the global posture review or the national defense strategy or
our views on Russia-Ukraine or China, [we are making sure that our
allies are familiar with our thinking even before some of the decisions
have been finalized, and certainly after a decision has been
made]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[We've worked to brief allies on
the thinking behind that decision and what our position is rooted
in]{.underline}**, what kind of thinking it's rooted in.

### Uniq: NATO Cohesion High---A2 "Defense Spending Disputes"

#### Russia invasion settles defense spending debate 

**[Borzillo, 2022]{.underline}**

II\. Towards A Strengthening of NATO\'s Capabilities However**[, the
[rediscovered cohesion is only one illustration of NATO\'s resurrection,
and the current developments in armaments budgets are another eloquent
example, as is the deployment of troops on the eastern
flank]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Programmed End of the Burden-Sharing
Debate [**[The war in Ukraine is indeed accelerating the increase in
defence spending in many Alliance member countries]{.underline}**. **[It
also marks the likely end of the nearly 20-year-old debate over the 2%
defence spending within NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}**
Dating back to NATO\'s 2006 Riga Summit, this less binding commitment by
allies to spend 2% of their GDP on defence has been a regular bone of
contention between Europeans and Americans. Given the generally low
estimate of the Russian threat in recent years and U.S. pressure --
especially under Donald Trump\'s tenure -- for some states the issue
simply came down to buying new F- 35 fighter jets. **[The Russian
invasion, however, mostly puts an end to this procrastination and
debate. In fact, it is likely that in the near future the debate will no
longer be about 2% that almost all states will have reached, but rather
about the reality of each state\'s military power]{.underline}**, given
the expenses incurred. Among the major NATO states, three groups seem to
be forming at the moment: those that have radically changed their
position; those that are not changing their spending forecasts; and
those that are increasing their spending a little, or for whom this is
beginning to be considered.

Persistent Tensions

**[[Whether on the issue of arms and equipment deliveries to Ukraine or
on the issue of sanctions, there is still a great deal of cohesion among
the allies]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While the European Union has already
pledged one and a half billion euros in military supplies, the United
States has just pledged a package of 14 billion dollars for the
Ukrainian crisis, although half of it is intended for the deployment of
American troops in Europe. Coordination on economic sanctions, however,
involves more intensive exchanges between the allies, with some
differences remaining, although much has already been accomplished in
the space of a few weeks. For example, Germany has taken the symbolic
decision to suspend the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which was
intended to increase Russian gas deliveries to Germany. However, some
European countries, including Germany and Italy, remain heavily
dependent on Russian imports. While Berlin, Paris and London are still
reluctant to deprive themselves of Russian hydrocarbons, Washington has
ordered an embargo on American imports of Russian oil and gas. The
United States is thus pushing Europeans to reopen the debate on energy
independence.

While even countries such as Germany and Italy, which traditionally
showed understanding or even leniency towards Moscow, have since changed
their stance, **[one country still stands out as regards both sanctions
and arms deliveries]{.underline}**: Victor Orban\'s
**[[Hungary.]{.underline}]{.mark}** However, **[its [capacity for
influence is limited and for the moment it is not in a position to block
the measures taken by other countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
**[I]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ts position could change, however, as a
result of pressure from its usual allies in the Visegrad Group, and the
risk of complete isolation for Budapest is not without danger, both
within the EU and in NATO.]{.underline}**

**[[The case of Turkey further illustrates the return of strong cohesion
within NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An ambivalent ally, Turkey had been
under U.S. sanctions since 2019 following the purchase of Russian S-400
anti-aircraft systems, as well as under European sanctions for
humanitarian reasons and because of its positioning in Syria. Strong
tensions and incidents had even occurred with Paris and Athens in recent
years**[. However, without supporting Western sanctions against Russia,
[Turkey has strongly condemned the Russian invasion and reiterated its
support for the physical integrity and independence of Ukraine, but also
for NATO\'s \"open door\" policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ankara has also
blocked the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits to Russian warships in
accordance with the Montreux Convention of 1936. Even more surprisingly,
**[the French president announced on March 25 the launch of a
humanitarian operation to evacuate civilians from Mariupol in close
coordination with Turkey]{.underline}** and Greece. However, the
operation could not take place due to the decisions taken by Moscow.

Later this week, NATO leaders will gather in Brussels for an
extraordinary snap summit, building upon the defense ministerial last
week and the virtual leaders' summit held in late February 2022.

Top of the agenda will be **[adapting the alliance to the new normal in
European security]{.underline}**, characterized by a reckless,
aggressive Russia apparently bent on re-establishing a sphere of
influence across Eastern Europe. Part of NATO's adaptation should
**[include an uncompromising re-embrace of territorial
defense.]{.underline}**

**[To some degree, [the alliance has been re-embracing territorial
defense since 2014]{.mark}]{.underline}**, when Russia first invaded
Ukraine and illegally annexed Crimea.

The Kremlin's actions then prompted a dramatic reappraisal of the
alliance's ways and means. **[[As a result, defense spending grew across
the alliance]{.mark} after having declined, on average, for nearly a
quarter century. [Equipment modernization was given a kickstart through
these budgetary increases, and in some cases allies expanded their
military]{.mark}]{.underline}** ~~man~~**[[power]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[Readiness---]{.mark}an otherwise esoteric topic left to defense
policy experts---[became the subject of conversation]{.mark} among
presidents and prime ministers as NATO expanded its exercises and
rejuvenated its rapid response forces]{.underline}**. And the alliance
decided to deploy four 1,200-person multinational battlegroups among the
three Baltic states and Poland on a persistent basis, to both help
defend those countries and act as a kind of tripwire should Russia
attack.

US and Allied Posture Adjustments So Far

In the lead-up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and since the outbreak
of hostilities, **[the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and [NATO allies
have undertaken numerous steps to bolster allied force posture in
Eastern Europe, enhancing deterrence against more robust Russian
aggression and demonstrating the Alliance's ability to defend its
eastern flank]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Importantly, [deployments have
come from a diverse group of European and North American
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the activation of the NATO Response
Force (NRF) will spur additional contributions. All told, the United
States will have activated an additional fourteen thousand troops for
deploy- ment in Europe, along with twenty-eight fighters, four B-52
bombers, six tanker aircraft, and four warships. This brings to- tal US
personnel in Europe to nearly one hundred thousand.

**[[European allies have made important contributions]{.mark} as well,
with Germany, Canada, and the United Kingdom all reinforc- ing their
NATO Enhanced Forward Presence]{.underline}** battlegroups in the Baltic
states, France deploying forces to Romania as part of NATO's activation
of elements of the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), and
allies such as Denmark, the Netherlands, and Spain sending additional
aircraft to NATO's air policing missions. With the activation of the
NRF, it is likely we will see more troop commitments from European
allies, as the majority of NRF forces are sourced from Europe. While the
NRF is meant to be a temporary deployment, many of the European
deployments, both those under way and those announced for the near
future, lay the groundwork for a per- manently larger NATO presence
along its eastern flank, and should be built upon. A detailed list of
posture adjustments undertaken by the Alliance can be found in the
Appendix.

Given the likelihood that this war goes on in one form or another for a
long time---it doesn't seem like we're especially close to a negotiated
outcome, given where things are on the battlefield, neither the
Ukrainians nor the Russians seem especially inclined to bend on key
demands at this point---**[the risk of escalation between Russia and
NATO and Russia and United States seems to grow over
time.]{.underline}** What worries you when it comes to escalation?

JULIE SMITH

Well, we spend a lot of time thinking about escalation, and I turn to
President Biden all the time to make sure I understand, again, what his
objectives are, where he wants America to engage, where he doesn't. One
thing that's changed is the types of assistance that we've provided to
Ukraine, and that's because the conversations we have with them on a
daily basis are evolving thanks to events on the ground. And while we
were focused early on things like air defense and ammunition, we've had
conversations with them about coastal defense, we've had conversations
with them about the need for armored vehicles, and now advanced rocket
systems. But there are some things that haven't changed. **[[What hasn't
changed is the president's determination to avoid making NATO a party to
this conflict---and NATO allies are agreed on that
position.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[No one inside the NATO alliance is suggesting that NATO start
providing lethal assistance. Individual NATO allies are providing
assistance, but NATO as an organization is not]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and we were all clear in that. The president has been clear in stating
that American troops will not be part of this conflict, and I don't see
that changing either. So, yes, **[we will have to continue to have our
conversations about escalation and escalation management and ensure that
our effort has to be to stop the conflict]{.underline}**---**[to stop
the war in Ukraine and ensure that it doesn't expand beyond Ukraine's
borders]{.underline}**. So that will continue to be part of my objective
in Brussels, but also my colleagues back here in Washington.

Introduction

When NATO set its last strategic concept in 2010, Russia had not yet
invaded Ukraine, the alliance had not conducted operations in Libya, the
Syrian civil war had not started, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria was a
little-known local insurgent group, the Intermediate Range Nuclear
Forces Treaty was still in place, and China was not on NATO's radar. The
same year, the United States would be again surging troops to
Afghanistan and setting a timetable for withdrawal by 2014. Both sides
of the Atlantic struggled with the lasting threat of terrorism but, as
NATO allies looked out at the world, they concluded that "the
Euro-Atlantic area is at peace and the threat of a conventional attack
against NATO territory is low." Fast forward ten years and the picture
is very different.

**[[Russia's willingness to use force to change borders in
Europe]{.mark}, annex Crimea, and further pressure Ukraine with a
coercive military buildup directly [contests the notion that the
Euro-Atlantic area is at peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The deployment of
Russian intermediate-range capabilities in Kaliningrad brings back
memories of the prospect of limited nuclear conflict in Europe.
**[Moreover, [new technologies and domains are blurring the lines of
conflict]{.mark}, creating new concerns of escalation, and impacting how
allies and adversaries understand deterrence.]{.underline}**

In this context, NATO staff and member states are again taking pen to
paper to chart the alliance's course and reinforce its mission. **[[The
key task will be to match NATO's strategic outlook to the threat
environment today and over the next several years. This will span
regional and functional domain]{.mark}s, including some that were not
considered over a decade ago when the last concept was
completed.]{.underline}**

Given developments in and around the Euro-Atlantic area over the past
decade and more, **[[elevating and reigniting the role of defense and
deterrence should be at the center of NATO
deliberations]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This will require members to
reassess core assumptions about their own defense, including
understanding pressures on US foreign policy and European contributions
to the alliance. To help understand and respond to these internal
trends, this brief unpacks these key themes that will be critical in
NATO's ability to shore up its collective defense and assert deterrence
for a Euro-Atlantic area more insecure and under threat.

#### Deterrence focus key to avert conflict escalation with Russia -- including hybrid warfare deterrence 

**[Keil,]{.underline}** Senior Fellow, Security and Defense Policy

Deterrence and Defense are NATO's Primary Tasks

**[Changes in the strategic environment have always forced NATO to
rethink and reposition itself]{.underline}**. But adaptation has never
fundamentally altered its core purpose as defined by the Washington
Treaty, which holds that an attack on one is an attack on all. Rather,
as NATO evolved, a mutual commitment to collective defense has been the
crucial through line.

Yet, **[the conclusions of the 2010 Strategic Concept conceived the need
for collective action differently.]{.underline}** Following the attacks
on September 11, 2001, and NATO's Article V mission in Afghanistan,
alongside engagements in the Middle East, the threat of terrorism
weighed heavily. **[Informally, [core deterrence efforts took a back
seat]{.mark} as crisis management and cooperative security took on added
importance]{.underline}**.

**[[Russia's most recent military buildup]{.mark} along the borders of
Ukraine]{.underline}**---and its willingness to use force or the threat
of force for coercive purposes---**[[underscores how outdated this
strategic framework is.]{.mark} The [chances of an escalation]{.mark} of
conflict between NATO and Russia [are at their highest level in
decades]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Consequently, **[the [role of deterrence
in averting conflict and added capability to undergird NATO's core
collective-defense commitments is crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While
the current Strategic Concept may be outdated, the alliance overall has
not been stagnant. Responding to a deteriorating Euro-Atlantic security
environment since 2014, allies reinforced eastern member states,
creating the Enhanced Forward Presence, which sent four multinational
battle groups to the Baltic states and Poland. It also launched and
formalized other efforts like the Very High Readiness Joint Task Force
(VJTF) and the Four Thirties Readiness Initiative.

Moreover, **[[NATO]{.mark}---in coordination with the European
Union---[must bolster deterrence by finding ways to address]{.mark}
untraditional, hybrid c[hallenge]{.mark}s that span military and
civilian domains.]{.underline}**

But **[Russia's actions over recent months have only further cemented
the concern of NATO member states and the need for added deterrence
measures]{.underline}**. On the conventional side, this could include an
increased military footprint in key allies in Eastern Europe either on a
permanent or rotational basis. **[But the [alliance also needs to ensure
the viability and readiness of existing
mechanism]{.mark}s]{.underline}**, like the NATO Response Force, the
VJTF, and the Four Thirties Readiness Initiative.

Moreover, **[NATO]{.underline}**---in coordination with the European
Union---**[must bolster deterrence by finding ways to address
untraditional, hybrid challenges that span military and civilian
domains.]{.underline}** **[This should include further refining tools
such as NATO's counter-hybrid support teams]{.underline}** as agreed in
2018, **[as well as augmenting NATO's Intelligence and Security Division
to create a greater capacity for information sharing to alert allies of
vulnerabilities spanning cyber defense, energy security, disinformation,
and others. These efforts can ultimately help deter nefarious activities
that are below the threshold of conventional conflict but pose a
significant threat to escalate above it.]{.underline}**

### Link: Institutional Overlap

#### Streamlining key to NATO effectiveness -- failure to prioritize and unload onto other institutions issues outside core NATO focus undermines capacity to address China and Russia

**[Looking ahead, [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}** leaders
**[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}** consider ways to
**[[streamline]{.underline}]{.mark}** current NATO **[[missions and
tasks so that responsibilities that fall below the threshold of
existential challenges can be unloaded onto other]{.mark} multilateral
[institutions]{.mark} or]{.underline}** global
**[partnerships]{.underline}**. In addition to bringing an end to the
Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, alliance leaders should
consider getting NATO out of the security assistance and stabilization
business altogether. Calls for NATO to look for opportunities to do more
in the MENA region should also be rebuffed. Few would dispute that this
region poses real security challenges to European states or that these
challenges are particularly acute for the southernmost members of the
alliance, some of whom might even view migration and refugee flows as
rising to the level of existential threats. But while the 21st century
challenges to the "stability and well-being" of member states may be
numerous and growing, **[t[here is only one NATO. A single organization
cannot tackle every national security challenge its members face. To
remain useful, the alliance must choose which threats to
prioritize]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[Doing so requires recognizing that not every security issue rises to
the level of an existential threat to the alliance.]{.underline}**
Terrorist attacks were a common occurrence in many West European nations
in the 1970s and 1980s, yet NATO did not fundamentally transform its
agenda back then because members recognized that the threat posed by the
Soviet Union was greater. **[[While neither Russia nor China as yet
represents a threat on par with the Soviet Union, NATO should prepare
for the possibility that the latter (either alone or in combination with
Moscow) could pose an existential challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}** to
the Atlantic community in the coming decades.

**[Nor is it evident that NATO was ever the appropriate venue for
tackling threats like terrorism]{.underline}** in the first place.
Effective counter-terrorism requires intelligence-sharing; local
policing and counter-radicalization programs; and financial instruments
that agencies like Europol, Interpol, the Global Counterterrorism Forum,
and others are better equipped to lead than an overstretched military
alliance. **[The same is true]{.underline}** when it comes to other
activities the transatlantic alliance has added to its roster since
1991, like **[stabilization missions and security sector
reform]{.underline}**. In fact, **[organizations]{.underline}** **[such
as]{.underline}** the United Nations, the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe, and the **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion **[[provide more appropriate venues for
tackling many of the collective security duties the alliance has
assumed]{.underline}]{.mark}** since the 1990s. As a regional defensive
military alliance, **[[NATO's comparative advantage lies in providing
territorial defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** against other states or
groups of states. **[This is a comparative advantage that should be
preserved, not diluted by the addition of other security tasks. True
comparative advantage arises from specialization. Continuing to add more
and more security responsibilities to NATO's already-full plate risks
transforming the military alliance into a glorified
clearinghouse]{.underline}** or administrative apparatus **[whose sole
task is the facilitation of information-sharing rather than the
provision of collective defense]{.underline}**.

**[Yes, NATO is better equipped]{.underline}** to handle the myriad
security problems its members face than any other multilateral security
organization in existence today. **[But the [proposition that because
NATO has the resources and coordinating mechanisms it should
automatically take on the latest mission du jour is what has led to a
strategically deadlocked alliance.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

GDI-TM\]

To adequately defend allied territory and bolster stability going
forward, **[the [alliance should consider several key strategic and
operational moves.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[[Among the first of these is a more fulsome embrace of collective
defense as the core NATO task for the foreseeable
future]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There's no more appropriate vehicle for
this than the alliance's new strategy, which is currently under
development. **[[While it would be nice to think that NATO could devote
equal attention to its other core tasks]{.mark}---crisis management and
cooperative security---[allied resources are not limitless. Given the
scale of the Russia challenge, prioritization of collective defense
makes sense.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[At the operational level, a 360-degree approach to alliance
security---that is, devoting equal attention to threats from all
directions---seems equally a bridge too far, at]{.underline}** least in
the short run. Most of the major European allies are in the midst of
trading capacity for capability; that is, they are limiting or even
reducing total military force levels in order to invest in advanced
military capabilities.

**[Although this effort at qualitative, technological improvement is
necessary, it means NATO allies will be somewhat hampered in trying to
achieve a more robust territorial defense capacity, especially as their
more advanced capabilities take time to come online over the next
several years.]{.underline}**

Only by prioritizing the multifaceted threat from Russia---as well as
China in terms of cyber threats---will the alliance best position itself
to meet the demands of the new security environment in Europe.

## Link: Policy Focus

### Link: 2NC

#### Broad resilience focus undermines NATO's efforts to bolster cohesion and collective defense spending

"Revitalizing Transatlantic Relations: NATO 2030 and Beyond," WASHINGTON
QUARTERLY v. 44 n. 1, Spring 2021, p. 189\]

As noted, the **[allies have come far in terms of military defense
spending]{.underline}** since 2014. **[But NATO]{.underline}** **[has
only just begun to translate this effort into military reality and
cannot afford to take its eye off the ball.]{.underline}** Preliminary
assessments in 2020 of the national capability targets set by members
following their pledge at the 2014 Wales Summit to pour resources into
heavy, high-end, and ready forces indicate more work is needed.39 **[[It
will take considerable political focus and energy to take this process
beyond the infancy stage]{.mark} in which it still finds
itself.]{.underline}**

**[[The broad agenda of hybrid]{.mark} or grey zone [warfare and
societal resilience complicates matters. NATO once referred to the
latter as civil emergency planning]{.mark}]{.underline}** or civil
preparedness, and while the current resiliency pledge has a similar
focus on prepping NATO allies for collective defense, it is broad to the
point of slipperiness. **[[NATO needs to define in greater measure the
relationship between its core military capacities and its]{.mark} Warsaw
Summit 2016 p[ledg]{.mark}e]{.underline}** to protect the "continuity of
government, continuity of essential services and security of critical
civilian infrastructure," **[[wherein most of the effort will lie at the
national level and not directly relate to NATO's core collective defense
task]{.underline}]{.mark}**.40

COVID-19 will in particular drive nations to view such "continuity" in
public health terms, and there is simply a limit to how far NATO should
delve into such matters. **[[NATO]{.mark} and the EU have both
r[ecognized that most resilience efforts lie at the national, not the
collective, level]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, an]{.mark}d the two
organizations have pledged to continue to work together to strengthen
the resilience of their respective member states.41 However, **[the
[lines specifying the division of labor between the EU and NATO should
be developed further, with NATO only engaging this broad agenda at the
points where there are quite clear implications for military
capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[NATO has done more than any other multilateral organization to

In this important moment, **[[American leadership cannot be

**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[must ensure that the reflection
outcome firmly moors a future NATO]{.mark} to both sides of the
Atlantic, [refocuses the allies on]{.mark} the raison d'être of
[collective defense]{.mark}]{.underline}** (including the associated
necessities of robust defense spending and vigorous capabilities in
increasingly vital spheres like cyber warfare and information warfare),
**[while]{.underline}** at the same **[time ensuring NATO's readiness to
address a range of growing challenges]{.underline}**. Getting this
balance right requires an understanding of where the Alliance has been,
where it is now, and where it is headed. **[The [outcome of the
reflection process will provide vital guideposts for striking the proper
balance and ensuring the vitality of NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the
next 70 years and beyond.

### \*Link: China Focus

#### Focusing on China fractures the alliance and undermines its ability to deter Russia

**[Coffey & Kochis, Heritage Foundation analysts, '20]{.underline}**

\[Luke Coffee, Heritage Foundation institute director and Daniel Kochis,
Senior Policy Analyst, Davis Institute, Heritage Foundation, "NATO in
the 21st Century: Preparing the Alliance for the Challenges of Today and
Tomorrow," SPECIAL REPORT n. 235, 8---10---20, p. 17-18\]

**[[Individual NATO member states, and even the supranational]{.mark} EU
with its particular policy competencies, [have more tools to deal with
an emboldened China than does NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** as an
institution. NATO can deepen its existing engagements with Indo-Pacific
countries. This will ease cooperation with these governments and
militaries in the future and strengthen them (marginally) against
Chinese encroachment. It may also contribute to the governments involved
reaching common diplomatic positions, on freedom of navigation for
instance. **[[Until China poses a military threat in the North Atlantic
Region]{.mark}, as an institution created for the purpose of collective
security, [NATO should have a very limited role]{.mark} when it comes to
dealing the challenges posed by Beijing.]{.underline}**

**[The [reflection period offers NATO an opportunity to state clearly
what its responsibilities are when it comes to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and what its approach will be. To ensure
that NATO does not lose focus on actual military threats closer to home
**[it must]{.underline}**:

\* **[[Acknowledge the Alliance's limitations when confronting some of
China's non-military threats and push member states to do
more]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Some of the biggest challenges posed by
China to NATO's member states deal with investments in critical
infrastructure, disinformation campaigns, and encroachments in the
technology sector using Huawei's 5G. NATO should not pretend to lead on
an issue for which it lacks the needed policy competencies. Therefore,
while policymakers should look to NATO to provide a robust conventional
and nuclear deterrence for members of the Alliance, only the national
capitals, and in some cases the EU, have the political and economic
tools that can reduce the economic and political threats posed by China.

\* **[Not let itself be distracted]{.underline}**. With the BRI creeping
inside Europe's borders, the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mass
internment of the Uighur population, and the ongoing 5G debate in
Europe, it is no surprise that China is a major concern for Western
policymakers---and rightfully so. However, [**[for NATO, the most
immediate threat, and the threat for which it was created and for which
it has the tools, is Russia. NATO should focus first and foremost on
this threat]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

\* **[Be realistic about the military threat facing the Alliance in the
North Atlantic area]{.underline}**. At the time of this writing,
Russian--Chinese military activity in NATO's area of responsibility as
described in Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty has amounted to two
different exercises, spanning a total of 13 days, consisting of a total
of six PLAN ships over the course of the past five years. **[While NATO
should monitor Russian--Chinese military cooperation, the [Alliance must
recognize that its number one priority is Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

\* **[[Not let China divide the Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As seen
in the single sentence devoted to China in NATO's joint statement,
**[[there is no agreement inside the Alliance on what role, if any, NATO
should play]{.mark} in dealing with Beijing. [When Alliance unity in the
face of Russian aggression is vital, now is not the time for NATO to
divide itself over the issue of China. This only benefits Moscow and
Beijing]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### China is not a core alliance issues---should be dealt with by coordinated outside action by member states

**[Encourage the member states to coordinate military strategy regarding
China. [While NATO as an institution should limit its military focus on
China, for certain member states, China is a main driver
of]{.mark}]{.underline}** foreign and defense **[policy]{.underline}**.
**[This is particularly true of the U.S., and to a lesser extent,

\* **[Understand the range of threats presented by cyberattacks. NATO
faces a cyber threat not only from Russia but also from state
actors]{.underline}**, including China and Iran, as well as non-state
actors. **[[While the Alliance must continue to harden its networks,
NATO should recognize that, ultimately, the bulk of cyber defense will
fall to individual nations and as such should encourage robust attention
to cyber capabilities amongst]{.mark} the]{.underline}** 30
[**[allies]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

### Link: Disinformation Focus

#### Broader focus on disinformation distracts NATO from its core defense mission

<https://www.lawfareblog.com/nato-must-get-resilience-right-withstand-russia-and-china>,
accessed 5-23-22\]

First, **[[NATO needs to make clear the aspects of resilience for which
it is not placed to lead. As a rule, the more NATO engages the civilian
aspects of security, the more it moves away from its mandate.
T]{.mark}he alliance seems to have no natural role in law
enforcement]{.underline}**---such as fighting foreign influence
operations or weaponized corruption---because of the variety in allied
legislative frameworks and the existence of other established channels
for ordinary police cooperation. NATO may be able to play a bigger role
in coordinating between intelligence services on counterterrorism
(against Russia) and counterintelligence (both Russia and China).
**[[The challenges arising from disinformation are
real]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as seen during the Russian invasion of
Ukraine, **[[but NATO has no role in]{.mark} countering foreign efforts
to undermine public trust in the functioning of democratic institutions
in its allies. The [alliance should confine its anti-disinformation
efforts to military affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Russian attempts
to depict the alliance as an aggressor and a violator of the agreements
that brought the Cold War to an end.

### Link: Expanded Agenda

#### Adding to core tasks fragments NATO focus by going broad and shallow through more tasks reduces effectiveness---threatens ability to deal with Russia and China

QUARTERLY v. 44 n. 1, Spring 2021, p. 178\]

NATO is thus confronted with the choice of whether to merely update its
old Strategic Concept from 2010 or do a 360 degree top-to-bottom review
of it. **[A simple update would entail a broad focus on a growing range
of "core tasks" running on parallel tracks]{.underline}**. Stoltenberg
has indicated a preference for this option, which is reflective of a
complex and unwieldy security environment.5 **[But [more of the same
carries a risk of diluting NATO both politically and militarily: it
would fragment NATO's political focus, leave the deterrence of Russia
incomplete, and fail to define collective defense interests in regard to
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words, **[[there is a real risk
that NATO will seek the wrong kind of renewal: going "broad and shallow"
by taking on more tasks and/or elevating existing
missions]{.mark},]{.underline}** like counterterrorism**[, [to sit
alongside collective defense]{.mark}, crisis management, and cooperative
security as "core tasks" of equal importance, as it did when it elevated
the latter two mandate]{.underline}**s in 2010.6 **[[NATO should instead
go "narrow and deep" on collective defense, recommitting itself to its
original purpose of deterring and defending against systemic
rivals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Link: Hybrid Warfare Focus

#### NATO cannot address hybrid threats---should be a national government responsibility

**[Coffey & Kochis, Heritage Foundation analysts, '20]{.underline}**

Senior Policy Analyst, Davis Institute, Heritage Foundation, "NATO in
the 21st Century: Preparing the Alliance for the Challenges of Today and
Tomorrow," SPECIAL REPORT n. 235, 8---10---20, p. 79\]

As the Alliance and its members grapple with the threat of hybrid
warfare, the **[U.S. and [NATO should]{.mark} use the reflection
process]{.underline}** to:

\* **[[Acknowledge the Alliance's limitations when confronting hybrid
threats, and push member states to do more to prevent hybrid
warfare]{.mark} on their territories. [NATO should not pretend to lead
on an issue for which it lacks the competency]{.mark}. Ultimately, [good
governance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} economic freedom, and
trusted law enforcement and security services **[[are the best
bet]{.mark} for stopping a hybrid war before it even]{.underline}**
**[starts]{.underline}**. So, **[while policymakers should look toward
NATO to provide a robust conventional and nuclear
deterrence]{.underline}** for members of the Alliance, **[[only the
national capitals can establish the political and economic conditions
that can prevent Russia and other adversaries from using hybrid
tactics]{.mark} effectively.]{.underline}**

#### NATO lacks effective tools and policy competencies to address hybrid threats---national governments better

**[Hybrid warfare must be prevented or deterred]{.underline}**---it is
not something that can be easily overcome once it has begun.
**[[Once]{.mark} the]{.underline}** social, political, and economic
[**[conditions exist to allow hybrid tactics to be effective, it is
probably too late to stop them. This is why NATO should accept that it
plays a secondary role to national governments in dealing with hybrid
threats]{.underline}**.]{.mark} **[As with counterterrorism, [NATO as an
intergovernmental institution lacks many of the required tools and
policy competencies to counter hybrid threats]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[There are three main ways to counter hybrid threats and to mitigate
its impact:]{.underline}**

**[1. [Establish good governance]{.mark} on the local and national
level]{.underline}**. If people feel like they are governed fairly and
governed well, they become less susceptible to disinformation and
propaganda campaigns by Russia or other adversaries. Where there is
endemic corruption, a lack of strong local government, and the
disconnection of central government to legitimate political grievances
on the local level, the stage is set for Russian meddling.

**[2. [Encourage economic freedom]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.
People]{.mark} need economic stability and the belief that their
children have a bright economic future. Pursuing pro-growth policies
that help increase economic prosperity is an important part of
countering hybrid tactics. People who feel as if they have economic
opportunities are less susceptible to foreign meddling.

**[3. [Help to create a bond of trust and respect between the average
person and law enforcement]{.mark} and the intelligence
services]{.underline}**. If people believe they are policed fairly and
that intelligence services are not overstepping their bounds, a society
will become more resilient against hybrid tactics, Russian or otherwise.

In addition, law enforcement is often the first line of defense in a
hybrid war scenario. A very capable and professional law enforcement and
intelligence service can mitigate the effectiveness of provocateurs
acting on behalf of Moscow

### Link: Resiliency Focus

#### Resilience strategies undermine the core collective defense mission

accessed 5-23-22\]

In the coming years, **[[NATO needs to balance the impetus toward being
a "liberal bulwark" with its traditional role as a defense
alliance.]{.mark} To do so will require a thorough understanding of the
strategic environment]{.underline}**, particularly the threat posed by
Russia and the challenges posed by China. [**[NATO must adapt by better
delineating what aspects of security planning it is best suited to and
what would be better delegated to other
institution]{.underline}**s]{.mark}, while prioritizing partnerships
that share NATO values. As the drafting of the Strategic Concept is
being finalized and moving toward formal adoption by the NATO allies in
Madrid in June, **[[it is crucial to avoid the temptation to define
"resilience" as a core task]{.mark}. The Strategic Concept from 2010
outlined the core tasks of "collective defense," "crisis management" and
"cooperative security," but [adding a]{.mark} fourth [core task]{.mark}
this time around [would further confuse what is core to the alliance.
NATO needs to prioritize and refocus on collective defense]{.mark}, its
original and continued raison d'être]{.underline}**. The digital age and
the significance of political warfare is bringing about new challenges,
but **[the transatlantic alliance is better off tying resilience to
collective defense as an integral part of it rather than risking the
inflation of core tasks.]{.underline}**

#### Focus on resiliency risks drift from core mission of defense capabilities 

**[Larsen, CSS Senior Researcher, '22]{.underline}**

Since 2014, **[[NATO has become increasingly aware of the nonmilitary
challenges to its unity and resilience but has adapted only in certain
respects]{.mark}.]{.underline}** It adopted the so-called baseline
requirements in 2016, against which it can measure individual allies'
level of resilience regarding their provision of essential services to
their domestic populations. These basics that would be necessary to
withstand a crisis include access to food, water and energy supplies;
maintenance of core functions of government; and resilient civil
transportation systems. However, **[the baseline requirements are
technical measurements]{.underline}** that do not adequately grasp the
political nature of the challenges that Russia and China pose to
alliance unity. Moreover, their **[focus on civil preparedness, resource
management and infrastructure does not seem to fit squarely within the
competencies of a defense alliance. [NATO may be on a slippery slope
with the scope of its resilience concept drifting further away from its
defense capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[NATO,]{.mark} as an organization]{.underline}** and as an alliance
of states**[, [is aware of the challenges to transatlantic
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}** and cohesion that Russia and China
pose, **[[but the alliance has not been able to agree on the issues to
which it can bring added value]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The situation
today stands in contrast to the situation during the Cold War when NATO
successfully calibrated resilience to the ability to resist an armed
attack by focusing on civil emergency planning. Russia and China are
illiberal challengers that add new meaning to transatlantic security
cooperation, but **[NATO's adaptation will depend on the extent to which
the United States and Europe can find agreement on investment in
transatlantic security]{.underline}**.

### Link: Nontraditional Threats

#### Expanded definition of threats -- including cyber and information - risks weakening perception of NATO effectiveness 

**[Coffey & Kochis, Heritage Foundation analysts, '20]{.underline}**

\[Luke Coffee, Heritage Foundation institute director and Daniel Kochis,
Senior Policy Analyst, Davis Institute, Heritage Foundation, "NATO in
the 21st Century: Preparing the Alliance for the Challenges of Today and
Tomorrow," SPECIAL REPORT n. 235, 8---10---20, p. 9-10\]

**[Often, [NATO members do not share the same concerns in terms of
threats and security challenges]{.mark}. Usually, this divide inside the
Alliance is geographical.]{.underline}** In general terms, Eastern
Europeans see Russia as the main threat to the Alliance. In contrast,
Southern Europeans see spill-over from the Middle East and North Africa,
usually in the form of refugees and transnational terrorism, as the main
cause for concern. **[At other times, the divide is more about NATO's
functional role. Some want NATO to be more expeditionary]{.underline}**
with a focus on counterterrorism and out-of-area operations. **[Others
want the Alliance to focus on]{.underline}** non-traditional threats to
**[cybersecurity]{.underline}**, **[energy security, and truthful
information]{.underline}**.

In reality, NATO must deal with all of these threat concerns---both
geographical and cross-functional. However, **[[policymakers must
realize that there are limits to what NATO, as an institution, can do.
When policymakers expect NATO to do something it was never designed to
do, that creates a perception of failure, frustration, and weakness of
the Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For example, **[[NATO lacks
legislative powers and policy competency on key
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}**, such as energy security, immigration, and
border control. Yet in the past few years, these are issues on which
some have wanted NATO to take the lead. (See "Hybrid Warfare" in Section
Six for more information how NATO should deal with hybrid threats.)

### Link: Terrorism Missions

#### NATO poorly equipped to deal with terror threats---should focus on Russian threats not expanded terror mission 

**[Coffey & Kochis, Heritage Foundation analysts, '20]{.underline}**

\[Luke Coffee, Heritage Foundation institute director and Daniel Kochis,
Senior Policy Analyst, Davis Institute, Heritage Foundation, "NATO in
the 21st Century: Preparing the Alliance for the Challenges of Today and
Tomorrow," SPECIAL REPORT n. 235, 8---10---20, p. 13-14\]

**[NATO and Counterterrorism.]{.underline}** The Arab Spring failed to
usher in an era of democratic reforms for which many Western
policymakers were naively hoping. Nine years on, the civil wars in Libya
and Syria have become a breeding ground for non-state extremist groups.
Islamists groups, such as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham and ISIS, and
non-Islamist terrorist-linked groups, such as the People's Protection
Unit (YPG) in northern Syria, have flourished in the ensuing chaos. Much
of the same can be said about Libya, too.

Islamist terrorism has plagued Europe since 2014. As Heritage research
has shown: "In Western Europe, there has been a steady pace of
ISIS-inspired and ISIS-directed terrorist attacks over the past five
years. In total, 1,749 people were injured and 371 were killed in
Islamist plots between January 2014 and June 2019."23

In the United States, there have been more than 100 Islamist-inspired
plots or attacks since 9/11.24 It is only natural that the citizens of
NATO members want more to be done to fight terrorism. This desire is
reflected in President Donald Trump's rhetoric. He has used his
presidency to trumpet the idea that NATO should be re-tooled into a
counterterrorism force.25 **[[However important the issue of terrorism
is, calls for NATO to be re-tooled to focus]{.mark} first and foremost
[on counterterrorism]{.mark} operations [are misguided]{.mark} for a
number of reasons:]{.underline}**

**[\* [NATO was never designed as]{.mark} or meant to be [a
counterterrorism force]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Although terrorism did
exist at the time of the Alliance's founding in 1949, **[[the architects
of NATO focused the Alliance on territorial
defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** for good reason.

\* **[[NATO lacks the required tools]{.mark} for counterterrorism
operations. NATO is an intergovernmental military alliance. [NATO does
not possess legislative powers]{.mark} to confront terrorism, nor does
it have the ability to implement sanctions and block terrorist funding.
[It a]{.mark}lso [lacks many other capabilities required to fight
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} such as policy competency
over law enforcement and border [a]{.mark}nd immigration control.

\* **[While [terrorism]{.mark} poses a major threat to NATO members, it
[is not existential in the same way as a nuclear-armed and aggressive
Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

NATO's focus on territorial defense instead of counterterrorism does not
mean that the members inside NATO should not be working together on
counterterrorism operations---**[but [NATO as an institution should not
be the leader or main]{.mark} actor in these operations. Instead, if a
military operation is required to fight terrorism, [it should be led by
a coalition of the willing]{.mark}]{.underline}**, formed and led by
NATO members, **[but not by NATO itself.]{.underline}**

During this reflection period, th**[e [U.S. must demonstrate leadership.
NATO needs to refocus on its raison d'être on collective defense. The
U.S. needs to lead the Alliance back to basics, and focus the Alliance
on its eastern flank where the threat from Russia remains the number one
challenge]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The U**[[.S. needs to also ensure that
NATO remains fully capable of collective defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with robust defense spending and capabilities in areas including cyber
warfare and information warfare. At the same time that it is focusing on
basics, **[[NATO must be capable of addressing a range of growing
challenges, from China]{.underline}]{.mark}** to transnational
terrorism, **[[without losing sight of the Alliance's competencies and
purpose]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Getting this balance right requires an
understanding of where the Alliance has been, where it is, and where it
is going. This Special Report will provide vital guideposts for striking
the proper balance, and ensuring the vitality of NATO for the next 70
years and beyond.

#### Russia and China emboldened by expanded policy agenda

QUARTERLY v. 44 n. 1, Spring 2021, p. 186-187\]

**[[A focused (narrow and deep) approach to a renewed Strategic Concept
would serve NATO better than a broadened agenda because it highlights
what NATO does best---collective defense]{.mark}---and]{.underline}** in
a complex security environment, **[[it forces decision-makers to think
through the defense implications of political]{.mark}
choices]{.underline}** like enlargement. **[NATO can and should address
any theme and any geography that impacts its collective defense
interests]{.underline}** and capacity; **[[it should avoid chasing
alliance legitimacy and relevance by labeling a range of national
security issues as "core tasks."]{.mark} Continuing to go wide will
bring NATO into conflict with the range of domestic reforms as well as
the political0economic rationale of a strengthened EU.]{.underline}**

**[[Russia and China are the two strategic actors that have a capacity
to break NATO by strategies of coercion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. NATO
allies, by fighting long wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and intervening in
Libya and Syria, have offered these competitors ample opportunity to
adapt to Western military strengths and political weaknesses.29 **[[Were
NATO]{.mark} to]{.underline}** label these countries threats and
challenges, which it has, and then **[[wander off in many policy
directions, which it may, it would embolden these competitors further
and erode NATO's own resolve and reputation]{.mark}. This challenge lies
at the heart of a new Strategic Conce]{.underline}**pt for NATO.

As authors, we cannot pretend to offer a full roadmap for such a new
Strategic Concept; however, we can sketch some of the key issues to
which decisionmakers should pay particular attention, as well as
pitfalls they should avoid. Below we offer an outline of how NATO can
best position itself for a slimmer, collective defense-focused Strategic
Concept, organized around the central tenets of the alliance's founding
document---the Washington Treaty

### Internal: Great Power Competition

#### NATO needs to focus on great power competition---cannot deal with other missions

While one can debate the wisdom of NATO having accumulated such an
expansionist security agenda in an era marked by American unipolarity,
**[[an all-encompassing approach to security is harder to
justify]{.mark} in a time of waning American power]{.underline}**. Just
as the diminishing threat of **[[great-power
competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the 1990s and early 2000s freed
NATO to take on additional security tasks beyond its traditional mission
of collective defense, its **[return should prompt a reexamination to
determine whether NATO is still the appropriate entity for handling
[such tasks]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[Another center of excellence, special representative, or office will
not fix]{.underline}** what ails **[NATO]{.underline}**. As the authors
of a recent Heritage Foundation report on "NATO in the 21st Century" put
it, **[[it is time for NATO to get "back to the basics." There are
limits to what an international institution]{.mark} --- even one as
successful as NATO --- [can accomplish: "When policymakers expect or
want NATO to do what it was never designed to do, that is when the
Alliance risks failure."]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The launch of NATO Secretary Gen. Jens Stoltenberg's #NATO2030
reflection process earlier this year to address political reforms within
the alliance presented just such an opportunity to tackle these and
other big-picture questions. It is still unclear to what extent the
pandemic has delayed the work of the group of experts begun last March.
The Biden team will have to move quickly if it hopes to help shape the
working group's deliberations, as Stoltenberg is slated to brief members
on the path forward for the alliance at the April 2021 Leaders' Summit.

# Impact: China

With Trump gone, **[the [alliance can't]{.mark} simply [go back to
business as usual --- because]{.mark}]{.underline}** for some time now
**[[business as usual]{.mark} i]{.underline}**n NATO **[[has meant
taking on more]{.mark} and more r[oles]{.mark} and activities in a
frantic quest for relevance]{.underline}**. And while Trump absolutely
damaged the alliance, it would be foolhardy to blame all of its problems
on him: **[Mission drift]{.underline}**, for instance, long **[predated
his administration. [A longer-term corrective may involve reorienting
the security organization's focus toward its traditional role of
deterring and defending against strategic competitors: Russia]{.mark},
yes, but [even more so Ch]{.mark}ina. That nation is the obvious
successor to the]{.underline}** mid-20th-century **[Soviet Union in
harboring global ideological aspirations at odds with those of the major
Western democracie]{.underline}**s

The end of the Cold War understandably precipitated NATO's identity
crisis. **[With U.S. guidance, the organization pivoted away from its
longtime focus on collective defense agains]{.underline}**t Moscow ---
an attack on one member would be considered an attack on all ---
**[toward a global peace-enforcement role]{.underline}**. The security
of nations outside the alliance became a concern on the theory that
instability and violence beyond NATO's borders could spill over onto
alliance territory, and because intervention to stop humanitarian
catastrophes was seen as inherently right. (In the 1990s, then-Sen.
Richard Lugar famously declared that the alliance must go "out of area"
lest it risk going "out of business.") This shift was accompanied by
expansion: Since the late '90s, NATO has nearly doubled its membership,
from 16 to 30, incorporating states that were once part of the Soviet
Union, like Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, or members of the Warsaw
Treaty Organization, like Poland.

Early examples of NATO's new role included the bombing of Yugoslavia in
1999 to halt violence against Kosovar civilians perpetrated by Slobodan
Milosevic's regime, followed by peacekeeping duties there. In 2003, NATO
took on the task of enforcing peace in Afghanistan after the invasion by
a U.S.-led coalition. In 2011, it intervened in Libya to impose a U.N.
Security Council cease-fire resolution on the Moammar Gaddafi regime.

**[Civil strife and violence in these and other hotspots are unlikely to
recede anytime soon]{.underline}**, but **[NATO is ill equipped to fix
such problems. [Worldwide crisis stabilization is too open-ended a
goal]{.mark} to serve as the organizing principle for a military
alliance [--- and such ambitions stretch valuable NATO resources at a
time when threats to the]{.mark} North Atlantic [region are growing.
Refocusing NATO to check the dangers posed by China's rise would restore
it to something closer to its original mission of safeguarding allies
from strategic competitors]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[Instead of seeking to tackle every new security challenge]{.mark} of
the 21st century, [NATO]{.mark} leaders [should]{.mark} work to
[preserve]{.mark} NATO's [core assets and capabilities for]{.mark} the
task that it is uniquely suited for: [deterring state-based adversaries

collective defense and a collective security organization has
passed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Amid the reemergence of great-power
rivalries, it no longer makes sense to assign NATO's limited resources
to naval operations in support of the refugee crisis as the organization
did back in 2016. Or for the alliance to continue to try its hand at
stabilizing war-torn nations.

NATO has survived this long by adapting. But unlike in the past, where
NATO adaptation has always meant taking on more responsibilities, the
**[[reforms needed today are those that involve shedding
commitments]{.mark} rather than taking on additional
one]{.underline}**s. In seeking to reestablish NATO once again as an
alliance focused solely on collective defense, and not a collective
security organization, the **[Biden]{.underline}** team **[will need to
resist the urge to pick up the phone and call NATO Headquarters whenever
a new security challenge emerges]{.underline}**, like previous U.S.
presidents have done since the end of the Cold War.

**[Jettisoning]{.underline}** the **[collective security
responsibilities]{.underline}** the NATO alliance has assumed over the
past three decades won't be easy. Nor does freeing NATO from
responsibility for tackling issues like counter-terrorism and
instability in the near abroad mean that such threats are not deserving
of international cooperative efforts by states. It simply **[means that
going forward, countries committed to these kinds of activities will
have to look to organizations and venues other than NATO to
address]{.underline}** them.

**[[Rather than expend precious resources and continue to use NATO as an
instrument to grapple with all manner of cooperative security
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration **[[should]{.underline}]{.mark}** instead **[[reorient

Biden team will have to move quickly. [At stake is not just alliance
unity but NATO's future utility]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

### China Internal: NATO Key---Command Structure

#### NATO integrated military command structures key to territorial defense and countering China -- must narrow focus to command structure 

**[Moller, Seton Hall Assistant Professor, '20]{.underline}**

\[Sara Bjerg Moller, Assistant Professor, School of Diplomacy and
International Relations, Seton Hall University, "It Will Take More than
a Biden Victory to Solve NATO's Strategic Malaise," WAR ON THE ROCKS,

Much like the 1990s, **[the coming decade will be one of transition for
NATO]{.underline}**. Back then, proponents of alliance reform argued
that the only way forward was to enlarge the alliance and take on new
responsibilities. Without such reforms, they claimed, NATO would
disappear. **[[The choice facing NATO members]{.underline}]{.mark}**
today **[is [different: not a world without NATO, but a world in which
NATO fails to fulfill its intended purpose.]{.mark} Preparing NATO for
China's rise does not mean sending alliance-flagged vessels to the South
China Sea. But the reality is, as Stoltenberg put it last December,
[China is already "coming closer]{.mark} to us."]{.underline}**

Ultimately, **[NATO possesses few capabilities of its own. Individual
allies ---]{.underline}** and not the alliance itself --- **[retain
ownership]{.underline}** and control **[over the military]{.underline}**
material and personnel assigned to NATO operations and missions. **[The
[alliance's real strength]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} however,
**[[lies in its integrated military command structure. Preserving and
protecting the integrated command structure's organizational bandwidth
should be the primary focus]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the coming years.
**[[Unloading]{.underline}]{.mark}** the alliance's **[[collective
security responsibilities onto other international actors would allow
alliance military officials to focus on the challenges emanating from
China (and]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to a far lesser degree, **[[Russia)
free of the need to also tackle a host of lower-threshold security
concerns, all of which require office space, funding, and
personnel]{.mark} billets. Bifurcating collective security tasks from
collective defense would also force European leaders once and for all to
decide exactly what price they are willing to pay for their own national
defense.]{.underline}**

#### Effective NATO required to leverage resources to frustrate Chinese logistics needed for global expansion

Frustrating China's efforts in the "far seas"

**[[A second major role of the Atlantic alliance would be to contribute
to frustrating China's ambitions to expand its geostrategic reach in the
"far seas."]{.mark} At present, the debate about NATO's new "global
role" focuses predominantly on increasing its role in
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. The aforementioned 2020 expert group on
NATO's future, for instance, recommended that in response to China's
rise, **[the alliance had to "leverage its strong partnerships not only
in NATO's neighborhood but further afield in the Indo-Pacific in an era
of intensifying geostrategic competition and global
threats]{.underline}**."66 Others have also advocated a permanent
presence of NATO in the Indo-Pacific.67

To be sure, **[[closer NATO relationships with Indo-Pacific
players]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as Australia, Japan, India and
Mongolia [**[will add to add]{.underline}** **[to the alliance's
understanding about China's strategic behavior]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
the Indo-Pacific, given their geostrategic location and ambition to push
back against Beijing's assertiveness. Moreover, **[[enhanced political
and practical cooperation with these nations sends a welcomed signal to
the U.S. and its Indo-Pacific allies that NATO is prepared to play a
greater role]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That said, the main effort to
China's unfavorable geostrategic situation in its "near seas" will be
carried by the U.S. and its regional allies and partners. There, China
is already confronted with an "oppos- ing configuration of powers
organized around the U.S.-led alliance system."68 Moreover, **[NATO
officials have stressed that major European allies such as Germany and
France remain reluctant to utilize the alliance in a posture which is
too openly postured against China in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**.69
Presumably that is partly why NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg has
publicly excluded a NATO presence in the Western Pacific.70 **[However,
the broader geostrategic [task for the U.S. and its allies is to
establish a new geostrategic framework to also make "the far seas a more
inhospitable environment for China's expeditionary forces and overseas
bases]{.mark}."71 [This is where NATO comes in. The Atlantic alliance
could play a significant role in complicating the PLA's expanded global
reac]{.mark}h.]{.underline}** First, **[[a major Achilles heel of
China's global ambitions is its lack of overseas logistical
infrastructure]{.mark},]{.underline}** such as access to bases and other
facilities.72 Moving forward, **[NATO could not only seek to frustrate
China's efforts to develop its critical logistics infrastructure in
Europe, but also utilize its existing partnerships]{.underline}** in
Central Asia, the Mediterranean and the Gulf region **[to work toward a
similar outcome.]{.underline}** In conjunction with the European Union
(EU), the alliance could also **[complicate Chinese efforts to develop
critical military logistics nodes]{.underline}** in Central Asia and
Eastern Europe in efforts to **["preventing China from realizing its
strategy of building an autonomous supply chain]{.underline}** across
the continental Heartland."73

strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan (1840--1914) who argued for the
preeminent importance of great powers' ability to project sea power.31
**[U.S. strategy in the Asia-Pacific has been based on its predominant
sea power in the region which allowed it to prevent any possible major
challenger, including China, from contesting the East Asian
"rimland."]{.underline}** In the face of **[China's growing
power]{.underline}** -- which has turned the Middle Kingdom from a
continental **[into hybrid land-sea power32]{.underline}** -- Mahanian
ideas have become more important for the

U.S. and its Asian and European allies. **[[For U.S. military strategy,
sea power becomes ever more important to deny Beijing the ability to
dominate the Asian maritime periphery]{.underline}]{.mark}**.33 Japan,
one of America's key ally in responding to China's challenge, is also
moving gradually toward shoring up its sea power.34 Finally, **[[given
China's ability to project significant military
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** into the Indo-Pacific and [beyond
**[will]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[predominantly [depend on]{.mark} its
ability to project and sustain [naval power]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for

Conclusion

Classical geopolitical theories provided by Mackinder, Spykman and Mahan
have sig- nificant relevance for understanding NATO's geopolitical and
geostrategic challenge when it comes to China. A combination of
Mackinder and Spykman suggests that the Atlantic Alliance should
perceive China's rise as primarily a challenge to the Eurasian maritime
periphery. In response, Mahan's idea about the central importance of the
maritime commons should be a guiding principle for NATO's response to
China. Perceived in such a way, the article demonstrate **[that [NATO
could make a significant contribution to putting pressure on China in
regards to its continental direction and its ability to extend its reach
in the "far seas]{.mark}." The United States and its European [allies
can utilize their geostrategic location to frustrate Chinese efforts to
establish]{.mark} spheres of [influence in the Eurasian maritime
periphery]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Geopolitically, **[such [a NATO
approach would foster a transatlantic vision on how to deal with China's
challenge to the "rimland" and force China to spend]{.mark} diplomatic
and strategic [resources on both the Eurasian landmass and the
Indo-Pacific oceans, contributing to Beijing's]{.mark} challenge of
["strategic overstretch"]{.mark}]{.underline}** that Chinese analysts
worry about.79

Obviously, geography does not predetermine political outcomes and
scholars of classical geopolitics warn against narrow geographical
determinism in predicting the foreign and security policy of nations.80
Just because China's geopolitical rise should compel a specific NATO
response, does not mean its political leaders will act accord- ingly.
That said, the Atlantic alliance has proven remarkably flexible and able
to adjust to changing geostrategic environments. As China's rise
gradually encroaches on Euro-Atlantic geographical spaces, it is not
unreasonable to expect **[NATO playing an increased role in contesting
Beijing's global ambition and reach.]{.underline}**

There is no substitute

**[[NATO's uniqueness means]{.mark}, by definition, [it cannot be
substituted]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[NATO's transatlantic character
along with the military and political features described above exist in
combination nowhere]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[else]{.underline}**. The
UN, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the EU
can all lay claim to promoting security in one way or another, but
**[[none would have been able to mount the sorts of operations NATO has
undertak]{.mark}en]{.underline}** in the Balkans, Libya and Afghanistan.
Similarly, the Readiness Action Plan adopted after Russia's annexation
of Crimea in 2014 and the reinforcement of the eastern flank in 2022,
could only have been achieved by NATO. The same, of course, can be said
for how Europe's defence was organised during the Cold War.

**[Proposed alternatives to NATO have been few and
fleeting.]{.underline}** Abandonment -- the course entertained by
President Trump - is the most dramatic and consequential. Many worry
that a future American president may still invoke this option, although
there is every possibility it would still fall foul of the
constitutional need for Senate affirmation. As for the current
administration, it has returned policy to the mainstream. The 2021
Interim National Security Strategic Guidance describes NATO as one of
'America's greatest strategic asset(s).' The reasons why are obvious.
**[[NATO doesn't simply entrench American influence in Europe. It also
helps furnish a reliable pool of interoperable armed forces and keeps
the peace at one end of the Eurasian landmass, so allowing the
U]{.mark}S (the Ukraine crisis notwithstanding) [to prioritise the
threat from China at the other]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Even Trump came
to recognise these virtues. Tellingly, he never actually acted upon what
now appear impetuous and ambiguous threats to withdraw from the
Alliance. **[And in material terms, American support for the NATO Allies
(evident in the European Deterrence Initiative) actually increased
during the Trump years.]{.underline}**

#### US strategic threat calculations require resource allocation towards China -- require NATO burden sharing

But beyond the increased primacy of China in US national security, US
foreign policy also faces a multifaceted challenge at home. **[[Defense
spending will likely be under increased pressure]{.mark} in the coming
years,]{.underline}** with some former US officials arguing that a flat
defense budget may be the best-case scenario. Moreover, **[[allocations
within the budget will also increasingly focus on countering
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When the Pentagon released its budget
request for 2022, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks said that
"the department in this budget takes a clear-eyed approach to Beijing
and provides the investments to prioritize China as our pacing
challenge." **[The pressure from China's military investments in the
coming years will only further necessitate a closer focus of US resource
allocation to counter it. [NATO must take this trend and pressure on US
policy seriously]{.mark}. Here, [conversations about burden sharing will
take on added importance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A continued push for a
fairer burden sharing has broad support in the US Congress. **[There may
be divergence over the proper metrics, but few would argue that the
outsized contributions of the United States in all aspects of alliance
activity are fair.]{.underline}**

This reality becomes particularly problematic when combined with forces
of US politics that are either more naturally inclined toward
retrenchment or more skeptical of Europe or alliances in general.
**[There is worrying space for the United States to eschew more common
approaches to the Euro-Atlantic allies and partners.]{.underline}** Case
in point was the Trump administration, which took an overtly aggressive
and at times hostile tone with some of the United States'
longest-standing and closest allies. It was also reported that President
Donald Trump floated the idea of withdrawing from NATO on multiple
occasions. These political sentiments put significant pressure on the US
posture in Europe, with the Trump administration announcing it would cut
US forces in Germany by one-third, with half of those troops returning
to the United States. **[While never actually implemented and ultimately
reversed by the Biden administration, this decision reinforced the
confluence of burden-sharing problems and domestic political dynamics on
US foreign policy engagement with allies in ways that had been
previously unlikely.]{.underline}**

**[[It is clear that as the United States focuses more on China, it will
ask Europe to do more in and around Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Coming to terms with the challenges facing US foreign policy will be
critical for its partners and allies. **[[Europe must do more to
shoulder the burden at home, which has direct implications for NATO
deterrence and collective defense.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Political and
economic dynamics in the United States only add a need for NATO allies
and partners to rethink the role they can play in shoring up the
alliance's collective commitments in the current strategic environment.
This includes contributions to collective defense. **[[Russia's
pressure]{.mark} on the alliance and key partners [is unlikely to
subside. In]{.mark} this space, [added European capability will be
critical]{.mark} and ongoing conversations around a greater European
ambition or European strategic autonomy could prove useful if properly
seized and leveraged by NATO.]{.underline}**

#### NATO should focus on checking Chinese activities with Russia and in the far seas

A geostrategic blueprint for NATO's China strategy

How should NATO respond geostrategically to China? A good point of
departure is the observation by Yoshihara and Bianchi that **[in the
context of a globalizing PLA, U.S. and [allied strategy should focus on
exploiting China's geostrategic weaknesses]{.mark} in three geographic
dimensions: (1[) its continental direction, specifically as it relates
to Beijing's relationships with]{.mark} the other two major Eurasian
land power, [Russia and India]{.mark}; (]{.underline}**2) its "near
seas," specifically the waters and the rimland within the "first island
chain" of the Western Pacific; [an**[d]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[(3)
[the "far seas," i.e., the oceanic spaces beyond the Western
Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}**.54 It appears that **[[NATO is bests
suited to make a contribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the first and
third **[geographical dimension.]{.underline}**

Putting stress on China's continental direction

As a "composite land-sea power," **[China faces the difficult
geostrategic challenge of being strong in the maritime and continental
directions simultaneously over long-periods. Beijing thus faces the
perennial risk of being squeezed by hostile land powers and on its
seaward flanks, and therefore must devote resources in both directions
-- a dilemma identified by Chinese strategists.]{.underline}**55

**[For NATO]{.underline}**, this provides an opening to **[contribute to
an allied strategy to exerting pressure on China's continental
direction]{.underline}** in two ways. The first regards **[its
relationship with Russia]{.underline}**. The geopolitical "worst case"
for the Atlantic Alliance would be a unified Sino-Russian geostrategy to
jointly expand their control over the Eurasian landmass and rimland,
thereby inevitably intensifying pressure on NATO's Eastern European
allies, its Southern flank and Euro-Atlantic maritime spaces. Some
scholars have there- fore called for a new geopolitical deal between
Washington and Moscow to balance against Beijing, where the United
States would partially decouple from European security to focus on
China.56 In such a "Nixon Doctrine for Europe," the U.S. could
"conceivably partner with Russia in a strategic alliance to balance
against the Middle Kingdom."57

However, any such development would be detrimental for NATO's cohesion
since a reduced U.S. strategic engagement in Europe would be seen by
European NATO allies as a sign of weakened America commitment to
Euro-Atlantic defense. Moreover, **[a transatlantic geographical
separation of strategic foci into Europe (Europe-NATO) and Indo-Pacific
(U.S.) is neither in Europe's nor America's interest]{.underline}**. As
Henry Kissinger has pointed out, a "United States, separated from Europe
would become, geopolitically, an island off the shores of Eurasia
resembling nineteenth-century Britain vis-à-vis Europe."58 Therefore,
**[calls for a reduced U.S. strategic engagement in Europe to "free up"
resources to contain China in the Western Pacific are as negligent of
geopolitical realities than are voices insisting that China's rise is
purely an American problem and that NATO should stay clear off any
related geostrategic engagement.]{.underline}** Instead, adhering to the
geopolitical thought of Mackinder and Spykman, NATO's China approach
would be best served by an understanding that U.S. "offshore balancing"
toward the European "rimland" would be counterproductive. As Colin Gray
noted, historically U.S. decision-makers have understood Spykman's
emphasis that in order to "balance power in Eurasia it was essential for
the United States to balance there 'on-shore'."[59 **[And it is
precisely because of the rise of China, that NATO-Europe retains its
importance as a key "pivot" in a new geopolitical]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[dynamic]{.underline}**.60 **[[As a result, a better option would be
for NATO to provide a robust deterrence against Russia while at the same
time closely monitor Sino-Russian activities in the Arctic and the High
North and Central Asia.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Arguably, further China
encroaches into what Russia perceives at its sphere of influ- ence, for
instance in the Artic and parts of Eastern Europe, "classic geopolitical
con- cerns" that "lurk beneath the surface" of Sino-Russian relations
are likely to come to the fore.61 This would in turn put pressure on
China to guard against an increasingly uneasy strategic relationship
with Russia.

**[The question of how NATO should respond to Chinese power was a mar-
ginal one until the United States brought the issue to the forefront in
early 2019.]{.underline}** The Alliance's December 2019 London
Declaration observed that Chinese power presents 'both opportunities and
challenges', and its June 2021 Brussels communiqué detailed these
challenges, along with opportu- nities for dialogue.1 The new Strategic
Concept to be presented in June 2022 at the Madrid Summit should also
elaborate on the China question. This article explores the various
options open to NATO as it seeks to devise a China policy, both in the
run-up to the publication of its new Strategic Concept and over the
longer term. These options highlight differences in the European and
American visions, as well as ways that a balance might be achieved
between the allies' priorities. In preparing this article, the authors
conducted confidential interviews between June and December 2021 with
ten representatives of NATO member states, four NATO officials and two
experts. Military approaches A common argument concerning NATO's
relationship with China is that the Alliance is ill-equipped to deal
with the Chinese challenge because Europeans can only make a small
contribution to the US military effort in East Asia.2 **[At most, [NATO
could orchestrate a sort of 'division of labour' between Europeans and
the US, allowing the latter to focus more on
Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}3 **[Given Russia's aggression in
Ukraine and the consequent need for NATO to concentrate heavily on
Russia's revanchist threat, [this stance may seem superficially
attractive]{.mark}. The maximalist option would be for NATO to explic-
itly identify China as a 'threat' to Europe, along with Russia and
terrorism, and to modify its military plans accordingly]{.underline}**.4

Second, **[[NATO is well placed to meet China and its]{.mark} growing

**[[NATO has been closely monitoring China's activities]{.mark} in the

leadership in the Artic, as well as the pressures by China and Russia,
the Atlantic Alliance has moved to abandon its heretofore cautious
approach toward the Arctic. For instance, the major Exercise Trident
Juncture in 2018 focused on a scenario to reinforce Norway and included
High North elements. The establishment of the new NATO Joint Force
Command (JFC) in Norfolk in 2020 includes a focus on readiness and
preparedness for High North contingencies.75 Moreover, **[in October

Moreover, China seeks to expand its strategic reach in the northern part
of the Eurasian maritime periphery**[. [Beijing is a long-term

Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- including through a future military

**[China was a "Near Arctic" state, a clear reference to geopolitical
ambition]{.underline}**.46 **[Beijing, therefore, not only focused on
increasing its economic and logistical leverage in geostrategically
important places]{.underline}** such as Iceland and Greenland. Moreover,
**[highly troubling for NATO, it also attempted to by a defunct naval

Captured in the 2018 National Defense strategy, the "reemergence of
long-term, strategic competition," has reentered the public dialogue as
the preeminent national security concern.1 Within the U.S. Defense
enterprise, the assertion drives a perspective on potential competitors
and their impacts on U.S. and Allied strategic objectives. One of the
competitors, **[[China]{.mark}]{.underline}** and its Chinese Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) and **[subsequent [plan in the Arctic, the Polar
Silk Road]{.mark} (PSR),]{.underline}** potentially [**[threatens the
security of the U.S]{.underline}**. **[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} its
preeminent alliance, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**). Captured in a 2010 strategic concept,
NATO's core tasks include: safeguarding the freedom and security of all
its members by political and military means; promoting a community
committed to the principles of human rights, democracy, and the rule of
law; and preserving and promoting the transatlantic link to maintain
Euro-Atlantic security.2 The document also defines its approach to
security as the collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative
security mandates.3 The document directs NATO to discuss issues of
territorial integrity and political independence.4 Finally, the alliance
calls on the continued modernization and transformation efforts to
maintain NATO as an effective body.5 Despite NATO's collective defense
treaty, China could exploit the Alliance's gaps through bilateral
economic agreements, engaging those pro-NATO, but non- members in
Europe, and executing calculated actions that would fail to garner the
unanimous thirty-member vote required for an official response.
Concerningly, China has a history of operating with significant
disregard for global legal frameworks vis-à-vis military coercion in the
South China Sea (SCS) and predatory lending practices in Africa.6
China's behavior merits examination using factor analysis to understand
the implications of China's expansion into NATO's area of responsibility
(AOR). **[[As a self-declared "near-Arctic State," China continues to
increase its political, economic, and physical influence in the
Arctic]{.mark} Region]{.underline}**; its activities directly impact the
eight Arctic nations, five of which are NATO members: Canada, the United
States, Iceland, Norway, and Denmark.7 Examination of China's influence
and methods in the SCS, Africa, and in the Arctic within the Diplomatic,
Information, Military, and Economic (DIME) framework provides valuable
examples and indicators as to future Chinese actions in the Arctic.
**[The analysis suggests that [China]{.mark}]{.underline}** may exploit
its bi-lateral relationships with NATO Alliance members **[[purposefully
or inadvertently undermine NATO security interests in the
region]{.mark}.]{.underline}** China may also look to fill seams between
both NATO members and enhanced partners (Finland and Sweden), using
economic and diplomatic influence to shape their relationship with NATO.
**[More broadly, China's increased presence in the Arctic Region can
generally be viewed as an extension of actions in other geographical
domains and may indicate the effects the PSR may have on NATO's
security.]{.underline}**

China has also used its closer military ties with Russia to increase its
presence in the Eurasian maritime periphery. For example, in 2015 and
2017, the PLA Navy (PLAN) exercised with Russian forces in the
Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea. Its 2017 exercise in the Mediterranean
included live-fire drills. While the PLAN's access to overseas bases and
logistics hubs is still relatively rudimentary at present, **[a 2020

access closer to the Euro-Atlantic area is likely to increase50 The

**[[China's incessant need to control economic corridors and hoard
resources is a manifestation of their deep-seated anxieties.]{.mark}55
The ruling party fears an economic slowdown resulting from supply
disruptions or material shortages could lead to civil unrest and
eventual regime change.]{.underline}**56 **[To mitigate the single point
of failure and secure its vital interests, [China turned its attention
towards the North Sea Route]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the third leg of its
belt and road initiative.57

Since 2003, China has invested nearly \$90 billion into the Arctic
region with the acquisition of two polar-capable ice breakers and
infrastructure development from Canada to Siberia.58 The alternate
corridor has significant advantages over the Strait of Malacca by
reducing shipping time by 22% and lowering transportation costs by as
much as \$127 billion dollars.59 **[A[nother significant advantage to an
Arctic route is Chinese shipments would transit more secure
waterw]{.mark}ays instead of traversing pirate-infested waters off the
coast of Somalia or around unstable countries whose internal instability
could impact maritime activity.]{.underline}**

**[[Chinese economic strategy for the Arctic is more ambitious than
simply accessing maritime corridors]{.mark}.]{.underline}** China's
government-controlled corporations have aggressively used instruments of
national power to secure lucrative economic arrangements within the
non-NATO Arctic nations of Sweden and Finland. Chinese firms have bought
large interests of Swedish corporations and used their influence to
attempt acquisitions of military and civilian infrastructure. The latest
such attempt involved a proposal to construct and manage a deep-water
port to secure their footprint.60 To date, Sweden has blocked the
Chinese expansionist activities, but Chinese diplomatic efforts have
aimed at reversing Swedish policy, illuminating their strategic intent
for the Arctic.61 Within Finland, Chinese firms have relied heavily on
an amalgamation of diplomatic activities to exert the leverage needed to
increase economic access. Successful corporate partnerships with local
business owners and politicians have enabled China to solidify its
economic access within the relatively small but strategically important
country. The arrangements have become increasingly transparent as CCP
umbrella corporations throughout Finland make the population dependent
on Chinese trade and susceptible to its political manipulation.62

But the similarities are becoming uncanny as **[[a rising China begins
to pose a strategic challenge to the global system]{.mark} similar
to]{.underline}** that of **[the Soviet Union]{.underline}**; as Biden
frames the conflict between the US and China in ideological terms (a
clash between democracy and autocracy); and as both sides show a
willingness to resort to all means necessary to achieve their goals
short of a large military confrontation, or a destructive "hot war".

**[China has]{.underline}** certainly **[pulled ahead of
Russia]{.underline}**, which is trying to revive its old glory and
influence by any means necessary. President Vladimir Putin may play
dirty games with the West, but Xi is adamant about rewriting the rules
of the game altogether.

**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s strongman **[[rejects the
"international rules-based order]{.underline}]{.mark}**" the West
dictates **[[and insists on]{.underline}]{.mark}** co-authoring the
principles of **[[a new world]{.underline}]{.mark}** order.

In other words, the US may downplay Moscow's provocations as the
desperate manoeuvres of a "regional power", but [**[when it comes to
Beijing, it has no choice but to pay attention to this bullish and
bullying superpower]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

**[China has succeeded where it counts]{.underline}**, where the Soviet
Union had failed -- **[the economy]{.underline}**. China's economy has
expanded at an incredible rate and, all things being equal, is destined
to surpass that of the US in this decade.

China is also developing a strategic doctrine and posture worthy of its
economic supremacy, and which includes conventional, naval, digital,
space and nuclear military power.

There are many ways to quantify the Chinese miracle, no less in
comparison with the US. But it suffices for our purpose here to take an
overall look at the century since the US emerged as a world power and
the Chinese Communist Party was first established, in 1921.

In its first half, China suffered from turmoil, disintegration, foreign
occupation and horrific famine that killed tens of millions, while the
US became a world superpower, comprising 40 to 50 percent of the world
economy.

China began to get its act together during the past 50 years, which
coincided with the US's recognition of the communist government and the
late President Richard Nixon's historical visit in 1972, the first by a
US president. But it was not until 10 years later that China began to
widely liberalise and industrialise its economy at a breathtaking pace.

Joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), in 2001, has propelled China
to global prominence as the "world's factory". In the following 20
years, the Chinese economy skyrocketed from the equivalent of 13 percent
of the US economy to 73 percent this year; a five-fold increase. In the
process, it pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty.

Furthermore, Xi's 2013 multi-trillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative
(BRI), spanning more than 60 countries, has ensured China's strategic
enlargement and geopolitical expansion like never before. Interestingly,
renewable energy investments reached a new high of 57 percent of BRI's
total for energy projects in 2020.

The US may have hoped that China's membership would mean cheap imported
goods and the moderation and democratisation of the Chinese government,
but eventually, China's ascension led to a \$300bn annual trade deficit
and the communist party tightened its grip on power, alas.

As the China miracle unfolded, US power has continued to unravel over
the past 20 years, beginning with the debacles of its wars in
Afghanistan, Iraq and the greater Middle East and through the 2008
financial crisis and the disastrous Trump presidency, as Washington lost
lots of assets, credibility, and influence among friends and foes alike
around the world.

In the process, the US's share of the world economy shrank by almost
half to 22 percent.

That is why [**[Biden]{.underline}**,]{.mark} who urged Xi not to let
their competition veer into conflict, **[[must]{.underline}]{.mark}**
tread carefully after the summit ends to
**[[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[US has the necessary
geopolitical clout to deter a bellicose China from making any aggressive
moves]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Asia and beyond.

Likewise, it is incumbent on the Chinese leader, who is feeling
super-confident nowadays, to refrain from resorting to unsavoury means
or unnecessary threats that could escalate into a large confrontation
with dangerous consequences.

**[[The world's]{.underline}]{.mark}** wellbeing, indeed its
**[[survival, depends on it]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Introduction

How will the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) respond to
China's rise? This issue is becoming increasingly relevant for the
transatlantic security community. Under the leadership of President Xi
Jinping**[, [China has become increasingly
assertive]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and is **[working
toward]{.underline}**]{.mark} achieving the "China Dream" of
**[[becoming a global superpower]{.mark} by]{.underline}**
**[2050]{.underline}**, including through building a "world-class
military." **[[A centerpiece of this grand strategy has been to expand
China's global reach through erosion of the Western "rules-based order"
and contestation of the "Pax Americana]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in East
Asia and more globally. Consequently, **[geopolitics and [great power
rivalry have made a comeback in the form of a comprehensive U.S.-Sino
strategic competition for global influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.1 In
this context, the United States (**[U[.S.) has expressed expectations
for NATO allies to join its efforts to push back against
China]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For instance, former U.S. Secretary of
Defense, James Mattis argued in February 2017 that the future value of
the transatlantic security community depended on NATO's ability to
address "a more assertive China."2 The new U.S. administration of
President **[Joseph Biden also announced in 2021 that strategic
competition with China as America's "most serious competitor" would con-
tinue.]{.underline}**3 The Biden team reportedly expected European
allies to shoulder some of the burden in managing China.4

At the heart of NATO's China challenge is the need to grasp the common
geopo- litical challenge posed by Beijing to the Euro-Atlantic security.
As Danish strategist Sten Rynning has pointed out, for NATO to respond
effectively the alliance would need to recognize its own "geopolitical
character" and understand that **[China's rise "to international
pre-eminence is the defining feature along the East-West
axis."]{.underline}**5 Therefore, this article provides a geopolitical
analysis of NATO's China challenge through utilizing classical
geopolitical concepts. It argues that NATO allies are best served by
concep- tualizing China's geopolitical challenge through combining ideas
provided by British geostrategist Halford Mackinder and American
geopolitician Nicholas John Spykman. **[Understanding Beijing's rise as
a challenge to the Eurasian "rimland" and the "Eurasian maritime
periphery" would be key to galvanize a strong NATO response and avoid
counterproductive transatlantic tendencies to predominantly perceive
China's rise as a predominantly maritime challenge in the Western
Pacific.]{.underline}**

### China Impact: Liberal Order---Atrocities Impact

#### Liberal world order is better than a Westphalian system -- key to prevent moral atrocities

**[Walt, '21]{.underline}**

(Stephen M., Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international
relations at Harvard, "The World Might Want China's Rules," 4 May 2021,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/04/the-world-might-want-chinas-rules/,
accessed on 8/3/2021, GDI-ZW)

Given all this, **[one might think China's live-and-let-live approach to
world order would]{.underline}** eventually **[displace]{.underline}**
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tate**[s']{.underline}**
**[liberal ideals]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** normative **[foundation underlying most global
institutions would]{.underline}** gradually **[revert]{.underline}**
back **[to a more Westphalian character]{.underline}**. I think that
conclusion is premature, however, because China's normative position is
not without its own liabilities.

**[One problem is other [states are not indifferent to moral
concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}**, even in a world where power politics
continue to shape much of what they do. **[[Displays of
brutality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a callous **[disregard for the lives
of innocent people, and other acts of state-sponsored cruelty [are
alarming and repellent to others]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[even when
these actions are confined within the borders of a particular
state.]{.underline}** Even the most despotic regimes understand this
tendency, which is why they go to great lengths to conceal such actions,
to sanction or restrict those who point it out, and to concoct elaborate
excuses to justify crimes that cannot be hidden. **[The broad
(if]{.underline}** still **[shallow) support for the
R]{.underline}**esponsibility **[t]{.underline}**o
**[P]{.underline}**rotect **[doctrine]{.underline}** also **[suggests
many autocracies are uncomfortable with the idea that anything goes
within the borders of a particular state.]{.underline}**

For this reason, **[[Chinese efforts to promote a world order that
legitimates arbitrary rule and where governments' internal policies are
immune from moral censure is bound to make others
nervous]{.underline}]{.mark}**. When governments insist they have the
right to do anything they want within their borders, [**[other
states]{.underline}**---**[including]{.underline}**]{.mark} other
**[[autocracies]{.underline}]{.mark}**---will [**[wonder what they might
do outside]{.underline}** **[those borders if they
are]{.underline}**]{.mark} ever **[[in a position to act as they
pleased]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Privileging]{.underline}** the **[sovereignty]{.underline}** **[of
existing states and their absolute authority]{.underline}**
**[within]{.underline}** a set of **[borders]{.underline}** also **[runs
counter to the idea of national self-determination]{.underline}**.
**[Liberalism]{.underline}** emphasizes the rights of individuals, but
it **[has also been sympathetic to the idea that people with a distinct
culture, language, and collective identity should be allowed to govern
themselves.]{.underline}** **[This]{.underline}** ideal **[helped
destroy the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, ended the era of
European colonialism, and played no small role in the]{.underline}**
eventual **[breakup of the Soviet Union]{.underline}**. **[[A world
order that facilitates]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[mistreatment of
ethnic or national groups inside a country is not going to appeal to
those who either aspire to govern themselves]{.mark} or]{.underline}**
merely **[seek a more equal status.]{.underline}**

**[[An obvious case in point is China's]{.underline}]{.mark}**
heavy-handed **[[efforts to suppress its Uyghur minority]{.mark}
and]{.underline}** gradually **[expunge Uyghur cultural
identities]{.underline}**. If the principles of sovereignty and
noninterference are used to defend policies like these, they will lose
some of their global appeal, and China's efforts to chip away at some of
the norms that underpin the present global order are likely to be less
successful.

### China Impact: Liberal Order---Great Power War Impact

#### Spread of authoritarian nationalism prevents us from stopping global wars and climate catastrophes

\[Eric Orts, Professor, Wharton School, University of
Pennsylvania,"Foreign Affairs: Six Future Scenarios (and a Seventh),",

7\. Fascist Nationalism. **[[There is a]{.mark}nother [possible
future]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the Foreign Affairs scenarios do not
contemplate, and it's a dark world **[[in which]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Trump, Putin, **[[Xi]{.mark}, Erdogan, [and others construct regimes
that are authoritarian and nationalist]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Fascism
is possible in the United States and elsewhere if big business can be
seduced by promises of riches in return for the institutional keys to
democracy. Perhaps Foreign Affairs editors are right to leave
**[[this]{.underline}]{.mark}** dark **[[world]{.underline}]{.mark}**
out, for it **[[would be]{.mark} very dark: [nationalist wars
with]{.mark} risks of [escalation into global nuclear conflict]{.mark},
further [digital militarization]{.mark} (even
Terminator-style]{.underline}** scenarios of **[smart military robots),
[and unchecked climate disasters]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The **[global challenges are quite large]{.underline}** -- and the six
pieces do an outstanding job of presenting them. **[One must remain
optimistic]{.underline}** and engaged, hopeful **[that we can
overcome]{.underline}** the serious dangers of **[tribalism,
[nationalism, and new fascism]{.mark}. These \"isms"]{.underline}** of
our time **[[stand in the way of solving]{.underline}]{.mark}** some of
**[[our biggest global problems]{.mark}, such as]{.underline}** the
**[[risks of thermonuclear war and]{.mark} global [climate
catastrophe]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### The liberal order stops great power wars---collapse risks competing blocks and undermine collective action needed to address existential risks

Century," FOREIGN AFFAIRS v. 99 n. 6, November / December 2020, Ebsco\]

What would happen to the world **[[if the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[fully [embraced]{.mark}
this]{.underline}** kind of "**[[America first"]{.mark}
vision?]{.underline}** Some **[[analysts paint catastrophic
pictures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Robert Kagan foresees a **[return to
the despotism, protectionism, and strife of the 1930s]{.underline}**,
**[with China and Russia reprising the roles of imperial Japan and Nazi
Germany.]{.underline}** Peter Zeihan predicts **[a violent scramble for
security and resources[, in which Russia invades]{.mark} its neighbors
and [East Asia descends into]{.mark} naval
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These forecasts may be extreme, but
**[they]{.underline}** **[reflect an essential truth]{.underline}**:
**[[the postwar order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, although flawed and
incomplete in many ways, **[has [fostered the most peaceful]{.mark} and
prosperous [period in]{.mark} human [history]{.mark}, and [its absence
would make the world]{.mark} a more [dangerous]{.mark}
place]{.underline}**.

**[Thanks to the U.S.-led order]{.underline}**, for decades, most
**[countries have not had to fight for market access, guard their supply
chains, or even seriously defend their borders]{.underline}**. The U.S.
Navy has kept international waterways open, the U.S. market has provided
reliable consumer demand and capital for dozens of countries, and U.S.
security guarantees have covered nearly 70 nations. **[Such assurances
have benefited everyone: not just Washington's allies and partners but
also its adversaries. U.S. security guarantees had the effect of
neutering Germany and Japan, the main regional rivals of Russia and
China, respectively. In]{.underline}** **[turn, Moscow and Beijing could
focus on forging ties with the rest of the world rather than fighting
their historical enemies. Without U.S. patronage and protection,
countries would have to get back in the business of securing themselves
and their economic lifelines.]{.underline}**

**[Such a world would see the return of great-power mercantilism and new
forms of imperialism.]{.underline}** **[Powerful countries
would]{.underline}** once again **[try to reduce their economic
insecurity by establishing exclusive economic zones,]{.underline}**
where their firms could enjoy cheap and secure access to raw materials
and large captive consumer markets. Today, **[China is already starting
to do this]{.underline}** with its Belt and Road Initiative, a network
of infrastructure projects around the world; its "Made in China 2025"
policy, to stimulate domestic production and consumption; and its
attempts to create a closed-off, parallel Internet. **[If the United
States follows suit, other countries will have to attach themselves to
an American or a Chinese bloc]{.underline}**---or forge blocs of their
own. **[France might seek to restore its grip on its former African
colonies. Russia might accelerate its efforts to corral former Soviet
states]{.underline}** into a regional trade union. **[Germany
increasingly would have to look beyond Europe's shrinking populations to
find buyers for its exports]{.underline}**---**[and it would have to
develop the military capacity to secure those new far-flung markets and
supply lines, too.]{.underline}**

As great powers competed for economic spheres, **[[global governance
would erode]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[Geopolitical conflict would
paralyze the UN]{.underline}**, as was the case during the Cold War.
**[[NATO might dissolve]{.mark} as the United States cherry-picked
partners]{.underline}**. And **[the unraveling of the U.S. security
blanket over Europe could mean the [end of the]{.mark}]{.underline}**
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion,
too, which already suffers from deep divisions. The few **[[arms
control]{.mark} treaties]{.underline}** that remain in force today
**[might fall [by the wayside]{.mark} as countries militarized to defend
themselves]{.underline}**. **[[Efforts to combat]{.mark} transnational
problems]{.underline}**---such as **[[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[financial crises]{.mark}, or
[pandemics]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[would mimic]{.mark} the world's
shambolic [response to COVID]{.mark}]{.underline}**-19, when countries
hoarded supplies, the World Health Organization parroted Chinese
misinformation, and the United States withdrew into itself.

The **[resulting [disorder would jeopardize]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
very **[[survival]{.underline}]{.mark}** of some states. Since 1945,
**[the number of countries in the world has tripled]{.underline}**, from
46 to nearly 200. **[Most of these new states]{.underline}**, however,
**[are weak and lack energy, resources, food, domestic markets, advanced
technology, military power, or defensible borders]{.underline}**.
According to research by the political scientist Arjun Chowdhury,
**[two-thirds of all countries today cannot provide basic services to
their people without international hel]{.underline}**p. In short,
**[most [countries depend critically on the postwar
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[which has offered historically
unprecedented access to international aid, markets, shipping, and
protection]{.underline}**. **[[Without]{.mark} such [support]{.mark},
some [countries would collapse]{.mark} or be conquered]{.underline}**.
Fragile, aid-dependent states such as **[Afghanistan, Haiti, and Liberia
are only some of the most obvious high-risk cases. Less obvious ones are
capable but trade-dependent countries such as Saudi Arabia, Singapore,
and South Korea, whose economic systems would struggle to function in a
world of closed markets and militarized sea-lanes.]{.underline}**

THE WORLD CUP: AN EFFECTIVE MODEL FOR GLOBAL COOPERATION

The World Cup is a competition between nations, and people often show
fierce loyalty to their national team. But at the same time, the World
Cup is also an amazing display of global harmony. France cannot play
football against Croatia unless the French and the Croatians agree on
the same rules for the game. And that is globalism in action.

If you like the World Cup --- you are already a globalist.

Now hopefully, nations could agree on global rules not just for
football, but also **[for how to prevent ecological
collapse]{.underline}**, how to **[regulate]{.underline}** **[dangerous
technologies]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** how to
**[reduce]{.underline}** global **[inequality]{.underline}**. How to
make sure, for example, that AI benefits Mexican textile workers and not
only American software engineers. Now of course, this is going to be
much more difficult than football --- but not impossible. Because the
impossible, well **[we have already accomplished]{.underline}** **[the
impossible]{.underline}**.

**[[We have]{.underline}]{.mark}** already **[[escaped the violent
jungle]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[in which]{.underline}** we **[humans
have lived throughout history]{.underline}**. For thousands of years,
**[humans lived under the law of the jungle in a condition [of
omnipresent war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The law of the jungle said
that for every two nearby countries, there is a plausible scenario that
they will go to war against each other next year. Under this law, peace
meant only 'the temporary absence of war'.]{.underline}**

**[When there was 'peace' between]{.underline}** --- say --- **[Athens
and Sparta, or France and Germany, it meant that now they are not at
war, but next year they]{.underline}** **[might]{.underline}** **[be.
And for thousands of years, people had assumed that it was impossible to
escape this law.]{.underline}**

**[But in [the last few decades]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[humanity has
[managed]{.mark} to do [the impossible]{.mark}, to break the law and to
escape the jungle]{.underline}**. **[We have built [the rule-based
liberal]{.mark} global [order]{.mark} that, [despite]{.mark} many
[imperfections, has]{.mark} nevertheless [created the most
prosperous]{.mark} and most peaceful [era in]{.mark} human
[history]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Peace has changed

**['Peace' no longer means just the temporary absence of war. [Peace now
means]{.mark} the [implausibility of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[There are many countries that you simply cannot imagine going to
war]{.underline}** against each other **[next year]{.underline}** **[---
like France and Germany. There are still wars in some parts of the
world]{.underline}**. I come from the Middle East, so believe me, I know
this perfectly well. **[But it should not blind us to the overall global
picture.]{.underline}**

**[We are now living in a world in which [war kills fewer]{.mark} people
[than suicide]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[and gunpowder is far less
dangerous]{.underline}** to your life **[than sugar]{.underline}**.
**[[Most]{.mark} countries]{.underline}** --- with some notable
exceptions like Russia --- **[[do not]{.mark} even [fantasise about
conquering]{.mark}]{.underline}** and annexing their
**[[neighbours]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Which is why most countries
can afford to spend maybe just about 2 per cent of their gross domestic
product on defence, while [spending]{.mark} far, far more [on education
and healthcare]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[This is not a
jungle]{.underline}**.

**[Unfortunately, we have gotten so used to [this]{.mark} wonderful
[situation]{.mark} that [we take]{.mark} it [for granted]{.mark}, and we
are therefore becoming extremely careless. [Instead of]{.mark} doing
[everything]{.mark} we can [to strengthen the fragile]{.mark} global
[order, countries neglect it]{.mark} and even deliberately undermine
it.]{.underline}**

**[The global order is now like a house that everybody inhabits and
nobody repairs. It can hold on for a few more years, but [if we
continue]{.mark} like this, [it will collapse]{.mark} --- and we will
find ourselves back [in]{.mark} the jungle of [omnipresent
war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[We have forgotten what it is like, but]{.underline}** believe me as a
historian --- **[you do not want to be back there. It is far, [far worse
than you imagine]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Yes, **[our species has evolved in that jungle and lived and even
prospered there for thousands of years, but if we return there now, with
the powerful new technologies of the 21st century, [our species
will]{.mark}]{.underline}** probably **[[annihilate
itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Of course, even if we disappear, it will not be the end of the world.
Something will survive us. Perhaps **[the]{.underline}**
**[rats]{.underline}** **[will]{.underline}** eventually **[take
over]{.underline}** and rebuild **[civilisation]{.underline}**. Perhaps,
then, the rats will learn from our mistakes.

To see this, just work backward from the present. During the Cold War, a
bipolar balance did help avert actual war between Moscow and Washington.
But even in Europe---where the spheres of influence were best
defined---there were continual tensions and crises as Moscow tested the
Western bloc. And outside Europe, violence and proxy wars were common as
the superpowers competed to extend their reach into the Third World. In
the 1930s, the **[emergence of [German]{.mark} and [Japanese spheres
]{.mark}]{.underline}**of influence **[[led to the most catastrophic war
in]{.mark} global [history]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The **[empires of the
[19th
century]{.mark}]{.underline}**---**[[spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
influence **[in their own right]{.underline}**---**[[continually
jostled]{.underline}]{.mark}** one another, **[leading [to wars
]{.mark}]{.underline}**and near-wars over the course of decades; the
Peace of Amiens between England and Napoleonic France lasted a mere 14
months. And looking back to the ancient world, there were not one, but
**[three Punic Wars fought between Rome and Carthage as two expanding
empires came into conflict. A world defined by spheres of influence is
often a world characterized by tensions, wars, and
competition.]{.underline}**

The reasons for this are simple. As the political scientist William
Wohlforth observed, unipolar systems---such as the U.S.-dominated
post--Cold War order---are anchored by a hegemonic power that can act
decisively to maintain the peace. In a unipolar system, Wohlforth
writes, there are few incentives for revisionist powers to incur the
"focused enmity" of the leading state. Truly multipolar systems, by
contrast, have often been volatile. When the major powers are more
evenly matched, there is a greater temptation to aggression by those who
seek to change the existing order of things. And seek to change things
they undoubtedly will.

**[The idea]{.underline}** that **[[spheres]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
influence **[[are stabilizing holds only if one
assumes]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the **[major [powers are motivated
only by insecurity]{.mark} and]{.underline}** that
**[concessions]{.underline}** to the revisionists will therefore **[lead
to peace]{.underline}**. Churchill described this as the idea that **[if
one "feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him
last."]{.underline}**

Unfortunately, **[[today's]{.mark} rising]{.underline}** or **[resurgent
[powers]{.mark} are also [motivated]{.mark}]{.underline}**---as is
America---**[[by honor, ambition, and]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
timeless **[[desire to make]{.mark} their [international habitats
reflect their]{.mark} own [interests and ideals]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
It is a risky gamble indeed, then, to think that **[[ceding]{.mark}
Russia]{.underline}** or **[China]{.underline}** an uncontested sphere
of influence **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** turn a revisionist
authoritarian regime into a satisfied power. The result, as Robert Kagan
has noted, might be to **[[embolden]{.underline}]{.mark}** those actors
all the more, by **[[giving]{.mark} them [freer rein to bring
]{.mark}]{.underline}**their **[[near-abroads under control, greater
latitude]{.mark} and [resources to pursue ]{.mark}]{.underline}**their
**[[ambitions,]{.mark} and enhanced [confidence
]{.mark}]{.underline}**that **[[the U.S]{.mark}.-led [order is
fracturing]{.mark} at its foundations. [For China, dominance over the
first island chain might]{.mark} simply [intensify desires to achieve
primacy in the second ]{.mark}]{.underline}**island chain and beyond;
**[for [Russia]{.mark}, [renewed mastery in]{.mark} the [former Soviet
space]{.mark} could lead to desires to [bring]{.mark} parts of
[the]{.mark} former [Warsaw Pact to heel,]{.mark} as
well.]{.underline}** To observe how China is developing ever
longer-range anti-access/area denial capabilities, or how Russia has
been projecting military power ever farther afield, is to see this
process in action.

The **[[reemergence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a spheres-of-influence
world **[[would]{.underline}]{.mark}** thus
**[[undercut]{.underline}]{.mark}** one of the great historical
achievements of U.S. foreign policy: the **[creation of a
[system]{.mark} in which [America is]{.mark} the [dominant]{.mark} power
in [each]{.mark} major [geopolitical region and can act decisively to
shape events]{.mark} and protect]{.underline}** its **[interests. It
would foster an environment in which [democratic values]{.mark} are
[less prominent, authoritarian models]{.mark} are [ascendant]{.mark},
and mercantilism advances as economic openness recedes.]{.underline}**
And rather than leading to multipolar stability, this change could
simply **[[encourage greater revisionism]{.mark} on the part of
[powers]{.mark} whose [appetite grows with ]{.mark}]{.underline}**the
**[[eating]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This would lead the world away from
the relative stability of the post--Cold War era and back into the
darker environment it seemed to have relegated to history a
quarter-century ago. The phrase "spheres of influence" may sound vaguely
theoretical and benign, but its real-world effects are likely to be
tangible and pernicious.

Fortunately, the **[return of a
[s]{.mark}pheres-[o]{.mark}f-[i]{.mark}nfluence [world is not]{.mark}
yet [inevitable.]{.mark} Even as some nations will accept incorporation
into a Chinese or Russian sphere of influence as the price of avoiding
conflict, or maintaining access to critical markets and resources,
others will resist because they see their own well-being as dependent on
the preservation of the world order that Washington has long worked to
create]{.underline}**. The Philippines and Cambodia seem increasingly to
fall into the former group; **[Poland]{.underline}** and
**[Japan]{.underline}**, among **[many others, make up the
latter.]{.underline}** The **[[willingness of]{.mark} even [this]{.mark}

Geopolitical blueprint: China as NATO's "Eurasian Maritime Periphery"
challenge

How can the geopolitical ideas of Mackinder, Spykman and Mahan help
understand NATO's China challenge? The following sets out a case for the
United States and its European allies to perceive China as a major
hegemonic challenger on the "Eurasian Maritime Periphery."

In their in-depth study on China's geopolitical ambition and
geostrategic challenges, Toshi Yoshihara and Jack Bianchi have
highlighted that as part of **[[China's global power ambitions, the
projection of sustainable naval power includes strategic
Euro-Atlantic]{.mark} waterways such as the Artic and the
Mediterranean,]{.underline}** as well as the adjacent geographic areas.
They also note Beijing's strategy to making inroads into Europe through
the Indian Ocean.35 In this context, Martin Mitchell has argued that a
combination of Mackinder's and Spykman's implies a necessity for
**[America to understand that [China has emerged as America's key
competitor]{.mark} in the "Eurasian Maritime Periphery," [where Beijing
seeks to establish spheres of influence.]{.mark}]{.underline}**36 This
geographical space is depicted in Figure 1.

While Mitchell's article focusses on the Indo-Pacific dimension in a
U.S. strategy to contest China's control of the Eurasian maritime
periphery, this article applies this geopolitical framework on the case
of NATO. The Eurasian Maritime Periphery encom- passes maritime Europe
and its rimland; and understanding that **[[China's geopolitical
challenge directly affects Euro-Atlantic geography and security is
critical for NATO allies in mustering a collective
response]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Far from only posing a challenge to U.S. and allied interests in the
Western Pacific, **[[China seeks to establish itself as the major power
on the Eurasian landmass]{.mark} as part of its broader global
aspirations]{.underline}**. Tellingly, Mackinder's ideas appear to at
least partly drive China's behavior in this regard. For instance,
Chinese analysts concluded that China needed "Mackinder's heartland to
reduce the enormous strategic pressure from the eastern Pacific" and
that China's grand strategy had the potential to "be fulfilled on the
Eurasian continent."37 Moreover, Beijing "Belt and Road Initiative"
(**[BRI) is an expression of China's quest to expand its strategic
influence on the Eurasian landmass]{.underline}** toward the west
through an integrated and interconnected Eurasian continent**[. It is a
key piece for China's strategy to gain regional predominance in Asia in
the context of its strategic competition with the United
States]{.underline}**.38 Consequently, China increasingly perceives the
Eurasian landmass "knitted into one large geopolitical playing field and
the seas around it as a Eurasian maritime ring road."39
Geostrategically, the BRI might well reflect the ancient Chinese game of
go, that is, a "strategy that a player might adopt in a long game to
surround or neutralize an opponent's more exposed or isolated pieces
before gathering forces for an assault on the main stronghold."40 Such a
**[[Chinese strategy would center on the objective to gradually
establish a Sinocentric regional order across the Eurasian continent to
further minimize U.S.]{.mark} and Western
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.41 However, **[the continental
dimension is only one part of China's ambition to project global
power]{.underline}**. Indeed, **[China]{.underline}** is **[increasingly
relying on sea power to projecting military power into the Middle East,
Africa and Europe]{.underline}**, not least owing to the geographic
difficulties of projecting such force across the vast Eurasian
landmass.42 Elements of the BRI in the Eurasian maritime periphery such
as the aforementioned Chinese port investments in Greece thus serve to
expanding China's future maritime footprint in the Euro-Atlantic
security area.43 This creates long-term challenges to Europe's maritime
security and control of key waterways, and could directly complicate
NATO's military mobility in the future.44

Classical geopolitics, NATO and China's rise Just as geography has an
enduring impact on nation's strategy,6 geopolitics continues to
influence power relationships and international relations. Geopolitics
is concerned with "the impact or influence of certain geographic
features, positions and locations of regions, states, and resources,
plus topography, climate, distance, states' size and shape, demography,
and the like, upon states' foreign policies and actions as an aid to
statecraft."7 It provides the crucial "context for understanding the
behavior of states pursuant to their establishment and control of: (a)
boundaries, (b) strategically import- ant areas, and (c) sea routes and
land corridors."8 Moreover, it directly influences the global and
regional balance of power since it "affects the interests of the powers,
thus influencing conflict over vital interests."9 Importantly, classical
geopolitics has retained its solvency for statecraft and theory, as well
as for examining the enduring causes of geography for conflict and
peace.10 In fact, China's rise has led to a renaissance of classical
geopolitics in the strategic debate.11 Moreover, for policymakers and
practitioners, classical geopolitics has never lost its attraction.12
This is also evident in the current NATO debate about China. For
instance, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg not only observed that
**[[China was "fundamentally shifting the global balance of
power]{.mark}" but also observed that the "[geog- raphy of danger" was
shifting as a result: They are investing heavily in modern military
capabilities, including missiles that can reach all NATO]{.mark} allied
[countries.]{.mark}]{.underline}** They're coming **[closer to us in
cyberspace]{.underline}**. **[[We see them in the Arctic, in
Africa.]{.underline}]{.mark}** We see them **[investing in our critical
infrastructure]{.underline}**. And they are working more and more
together with Russia. All of this has security consequences for NATO
Allies.13 Moreover, an expert group appointed by the Secretary General
assessing NATO's future concluded in December 2020 that the "**[[growing
power and assertiveness of China is the other major geopolitical
development that is changing the strategic cal- culus of the
Alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}**."14 Moreover, France's President
Emmanuel Macron declared in March 2019 that Europe's future approach to
China had to be based on "a geopolitical and strategic relationship."15
Put simply**[, [NATO]{.mark} allies [can no longer avoid dealing with
China's geopolitical chal- lenge.]{.mark} Not only has [it become clear
that Beijing is a revisionist major power]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
dissatisfied with the status quo.16 Moreover, **[[its aggregate power is
growing,]{.mark} with long-term strategic implications for the
Euro-Atlantic area.]{.underline}** For instance, in 2020 China's defense
expen- diture exceeded those of European countries combined.17 In
addition, China has invested significantly in critical European port
infrastructure. In fact, in 2018 Chinese state-controlled companies
controlled about ten percent of European port facilities, specifically
through acquisitions in Spain, Italy and Greece. As well, Sino-Russian
strategic relations under Presidents Xi and Vladimir Putin moved beyond
mere "con- venience" and are now grounded in the mutual objective to
erode the U.S.-led Western order and to expand their respective spheres
of influence.18 As a result, NATO allies have paid much closer attention
to the potential implications of Sino-Russian strategic activities for
the Euro-Atlantic area.19

There may be circumstances and options for major powers to control their

U.S. China scholars and policy experts have been starting to refer to
decisive turning points in Washington-Beijing relations, such as the
March 2021 meeting in Alaska between senior officials, and this may
reflect a growing sense that the stakes involved are significantly
higher than in any recent period.20 **[[Chin]{.mark}a]{.underline}**
will continue working for a dominant regional position, as a major power
may be expected to do, but it **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
**[[maneuvering for global power]{.mark}, and these advances to the
global stage may surprise American strategists]{.underline}** if Beijing
does not follow expected paths.21 While power shifts alone should not
spell future armed conflict, **[the U.S.-[China rivalry has multiple

The historical record since the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949 is clear: **[When confronted by a mounting threat to its
geopolitical interests, Beijing does not wait to be
attacked]{.underline}**; it shoots first to gain the advantage of
surprise.

In conflicts including the Korean War and clashes with Vietnam in 1979,
China has often viewed the use of force as an educational exercise. It
is willing to pick even a very costly fight with a single enemy to teach
it, and others observing from the sidelines, a lesson.

Today, **[[Beijing might be tempted to engage in this sort of aggression
in multiple areas. And once the shooting starts, the pressures for
escalation are likely to be severe]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

# Impact: Russia

### Russia Internal: Deterrence

#### Territorial defense key to deterrence by denial -- solves Ukraine escalation 

**[Deni, 2022]{.underline}**

GDI-TM\]

As **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** places a priority on the collective
defense threat from Russia, it **[[should also move toward a posture of
deterrence by denial]{.underline}]{.mark}** across Eastern Europe.

**[This type of deterrence differs from what the alliance has primarily
emphasized in recent decades---namely, deterrence by
punishment]{.underline}**. **[Under the latter, the alliance deters
Russia by clearly indicating it will strike back in devastating fashion
if Russia initiates aggression]{.underline}**. NATO accomplishes this by
stationing its multinational battlegroups across the Baltic states and
Poland. These units are small and cannot hold off a large-scale Russian
invasion, but they include troops from across the alliance, meaning that
Russia would be taking on nearly all of NATO if it attacked into
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, or Poland.

**[Under deterrence by denial, [NATO's posture in the East would need to
be beefed up]{.mark} both qualitatively]{.underline}**---**[to counter
specific Russian offensive capabilities such as its artillery and
rockets]{.underline}**---**[and quantitively---to meet the scale of the
Russian threat. [The goal would be for NATO to stop and repel an
attempted attack]{.mark} into allied territory, not merely respond to
one after the fact]{.underline}**.

This sounds appealing---especially if you live in Lithuania, for
example---**[but [it means the alliance will most likely need to return
in some measure to larger scale territorial defense through so-called
"in-place]{.mark} forces."]{.underline}** This doesn't mean NATO needs
to match Russian forces soldier-for-soldier or tank-for-tank, but it
probably would mean a return to some level of conscription among more
European allies, to keep costs relatively low while generating the
necessary force levels.

The extraordinary summit this week provides the alliance an opportunity
to further refine and strengthen its response to Russia's actions in
Ukraine as well as [Belarus. **[By privileging the collective defense
mission]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[, at least temporarily [shelving its
360-degree approach, and doubling down on territorial defense
capabilities, NATO can go far in ensuring the war doesn't
expand.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Collective defense focus is the core of NATO---U.S. needs to promote it as the primary mission

**[NATO was founded]{.underline}** in 1949 **[with the mission of
protecting the territorial integrity of its members]{.underline}**
and---if required---defeating the Soviet Union. While NATO's members are
no longer worried about the spread of Communism, **[many current NATO
members are]{.underline}** certainly **[worried about protecting their
territory from Russian aggression]{.underline}**.

The **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[should work to ensure that NATO's collective defense mission and the
threat from Russia are the main focus of]{.mark} the Alliance. While the
Alliance faces challenges]{.underline}** emanating from an unstable
Mediterranean basin and terrorism originating from the Middle East,
**[the fact remains that [Russia continues to be the only existential
threat]{.mark} to member states. [NATO must send a strong signal that it
is strengthening deterrence measures explicitly in response to
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[[NATO must be able to deter aggression and defend the territorial
integrity of its members. Everything else that NATO might do is
secondary to]{.mark} the No. 1 mission of [collective territorial
defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty
states that "an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or
North America shall be considered an attack against them all." Any
deviation from this commitment will only invite aggression. This
**[mutual defense clause is what makes Article 5 the cornerstone of the
Alliance. Everything that NATO does stems from this critical
point.]{.underline}**

A European Security and Defense Ambition

**[The shift in the United States' policy does not mean it will abandon
Europe or the strategic umbrella---including the NATO nuclear-sharing
agreement---which is a foundation of its commitment to the
continent]{.underline}**. But as former Deputy Assistant Secretary for
Strategy and co-lead for the 2018 National Defense Strategy Elbridge
Colby asserted in thinking through a **[new transatlantic bargain, "[the
lion's share of the forces required to deter or defeat a Russian attack
on NATO would,]{.mark} however, [be provided by European
nations]{.mark}." Colby argues that [this would only require a modest
increase and adjustment in the type of conventional capabilities
required to deter Russia]{.mark}, but explicitly notes that "a dollar
spent or soldier stationed in Europe will be one not spent or stationed
in Asia. This means [Europeans will need to pick up a considerably
greater share of the burden]{.mark}."]{.underline}**1414Ibid.

While Europe has made significant investments since 2014, **[its side of
the burden-sharing equation is still insufficient. More funding and
political will is required to close the gap]{.underline}**.
**[High-demand capabilities like strategic lift and mission-enabling
assets like intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities
are still badly needed, not to mention more core conventional
capabilities associated with territorial defense. The]{.underline}**
**[United States has been forced to step in on multiple occasions to
provide logistical and intelligence assistance for European
forces]{.underline}** in places like Libya and Mali. In some cases,
**[there has simply been a lack of adequate munition stockpiles in
Europe]{.underline}**. **[[Overcoming these deficiencies will be
critical to creating an augmented level of European deterrence and an
increased European ambition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### Russia Impact: Deterrence

#### Deterrence key to check escalation---especially true given Russia's weakness

**[Economist '22]{.underline}**

\[staff, "How Rotten Is Russia's Army?" THE ECONOMIST, 4---30---22,

Ultimately, **[[weakness may lead Russia to]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
last arena where it is still indisputably a superpower: **[[chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline}** From the start of
this war, Mr **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** and his government **[have
[repeatedly brandished the threat of]{.mark} [w]{.mark}eapons of
[m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction.]{.underline}** Mr Putin is rational,
in that he wants his regime to survive, so the chances of their use
probably remain slim. But [**[as Russia's armed forces run out of
conventional options, the temptation to escalate will surely
grow]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

The message for the wider world is that Mr Putin's military opportunism
in Ukraine must be seen to fail by his own officers and strategists, who
may then temper his next headstrong scheme. A stalemate in Donbas would
merely set up the next fight and it could be even more threatening than
today's.

Yet, even if Mr **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}** is defeated, he
**[[will remain dangerous]{.mark}. The message for [nato]{.mark} is that
it [needs to update its]{.mark}]{.underline}** tripwire
**[[defence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This rests on the idea that a
Russian attempt to take a bite out of, say, the Baltic states may
succeed at first, but would trigger a wider war which nato would
eventually win. **[That [defence involves the risk of miscalculation and
escalation, which are more fraught than ever if Russia's conventional
forces are weak]{.mark}. Better to have a large forward force that
Russia would find hard to defeat from the very start. The]{.underline}**
**[[best way to be safe from]{.mark} Mr [Putin]{.mark} and his rotten
army is to [deter him from fighting at
all]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
