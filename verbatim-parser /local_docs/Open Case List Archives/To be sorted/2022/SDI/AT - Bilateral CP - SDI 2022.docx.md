Established during the Cold War, [[**NATO** is]{.mark} a transatlantic
security alliance [**composed of** thirty **member
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the United States.

NATO has focused on deterring Russian aggression in recent years, but it
has also conducted security operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and
Somalia.

Amid Russia's 2022 offensive in Ukraine, many NATO allies are providing
Kyiv with extraordinary quantities of military supplies, and the
alliance could expand to include Finland and Sweden.

Introduction

Founded in 1949 as a bulwark against Soviet aggression, [the **North
Atlantic Treaty Organization** (NATO)]{.underline} remains the pillar of
U.S.-Europe military cooperation. An expanding bloc of NATO allies has
taken on a broad range of missions since the close of the Cold War, many
well beyond the Euro-Atlantic region, in countries such as Afghanistan
and Libya.

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a nonmember, in early 2022 has
shaken Europe's security architecture and prompted a major reevaluation
of NATO members' foreign policies and defense commitments. The threat
from Russia has generated the greatest tensions with the alliance in the
post-Cold War era. It is driving up defense spending and pushing some
longtime NATO partners, namely Finland and Sweden, to seek formal
membership, which would mark another historic expansion of the alliance.

A Post--Cold War Pivot

After the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Western leaders intensely
debated the direction of the transatlantic alliance. Some in the Bill
Clinton administration initially opposed expanding NATO, wary it would
upset relations with President Boris Yeltsin's fragile government in
Russia and complicate other U.S. foreign policy objectives, such as
nuclear arms control. Others favored expansion as a way to extend NATO's
security umbrella to the east and consolidate democratic gains in the
former Soviet bloc.

European members were also split on the issue. The United Kingdom feared
NATO's expansion would dilute the alliance, while France believed it
would give NATO (and the United States) too much influence. Paris hoped
to integrate former Soviet states via European institutions.

As a first step, Clinton chose to develop a new NATO initiative called
the Partnership for Peace (PfP), which would be open to all former
Warsaw Pact members, as well as non-European countries. Seeing this
nonmembership framework as a means to allay some of Russia's concerns
about alliance expansion, NATO launched PfP at its annual summit in
1994. More than two dozen countries, including Georgia, Russia, and
Ukraine, joined in the following months.

However, Clinton soon began speaking publicly \[PDF\] about expanding
NATO's membership, saying in the Czech Republic just days after the
launch of PfP that "the question is no longer whether NATO will take on
new members but when and how." Yeltsin warned Western leaders at a
conference later that year that "Europe, even before it has managed to
shrug off the legacy of the Cold War, is risking encumbering itself with
a cold peace."

Beyond Collective Defense

Many U.S. officials felt that a post--Cold War vision for NATO needed to
look beyond its core defense commitments---Article V of the North
Atlantic Treaty states that "an armed attack against one or more
\[member states\] in Europe or North America shall be considered an
attack against them all"---and focus on confronting challenges outside
its membership. "The common denominator of all the new security problems
in Europe is that they all lie beyond NATO's current borders," said
influential U.S. Senator Richard Lugar in a 1993 speech.

The breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s and the onset of ethnic
conflict tested the alliance on this point almost immediately. What
began as a mission to impose a UN-sanctioned no-fly zone over Bosnia and
Herzegovina evolved into a bombing campaign on Bosnian Serb forces that
many military analysts say was essential to ending the conflict. In
April 1994, during Operation Deny Flight, NATO conducted its first
combat operations in its forty-year history, shooting down four Bosnian
Serb aircraft.

**[NATO\'s Structure]{.underline}**

Headquartered in Brussels, [NATO is [a consensus-based alliance]{.mark}
in which decisions must be unanimous. [**However**, **individual
states** or **subgroups**]{.mark} of allies **[can initiate
action]{.mark}** outside NATO's auspices]{.underline}. For instance, the
United States, France, and the United Kingdom began policing a
UN-sanctioned no-fly zone in Libya in early 2011 and, within days,
transferred command of the operation to NATO once Turkey's concerns had
been allayed. [Member states are not required to participate in every
NATO operation]{.underline}; Germany and Poland declined to contribute
directly to the campaign in Libya.

NATO's military structure comprises two strategic commands: the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, located near Mons, Belgium, and the
Allied Command Transformation, located in Norfolk, Virginia. The supreme
allied commander Europe oversees all NATO military operations and is
always a U.S. flag or general officer; U.S. Air Force General Tod D.
Wolters currently holds this position. Although the alliance has an
integrated command, most forces remain under their respective national
authorities until NATO operations commence.

NATO's secretary-general, Norwegian politician Jens Stoltenberg, is
serving a second four-year term as the bloc's chief administrator and
international envoy. However, NATO leaders extended his service for one
additional year (until September 2023) amid the war in Ukraine.
[[The]{.mark} alliance's principal [**political body** is the **North
Atlantic Council**]{.mark}, which is composed of high-level delegates
from each member state]{.underline}.

Human rights violations as outlined in broad terms in the 2011 World
Report, and pressure from organizations such as Human Rights Watch most
certainly add to the international pressure on NATO to intervene. This
has led to the discovery that military power may not be a useful
instrument in dealing with specific country by country issues in the
region. [[**NATO** is a **group** of]{.mark} democratic [**countries**
who]{.mark} in turn [**each** have an **individual**
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} when dealing in the Middle East and North
Africa, and are tied to the region by their oil dependency; but
protection of human rights as justification for military intervention
must be across the board or not at all. Military intervention in Libya
was completed swiftly based largely on the economic incentives of NATO's
democratic powers, whereas in Syria, NATO has been immobilized as more
people die everyday.

WHAT IS NATO?

[[**NATO** is a **group** of]{.mark} 30 [**member countries** that agree
to]{.mark} work together]{.underline} to ensure the security of the
Northern Atlantic area.

"NATO's purpose is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members
through political and military means," according to its website.
Politically, the alliance promotes democracy, and it allows its members
to ["consult and [cooperate on]{.mark}]{.underline} defence and
[[security]{.mark}-related issues]{.underline} to solve problems, build
trust and, in the long run, prevent conflict."

\--MDC = multinational defense cooperation

**Németh 14** Bence Németh, Teaching fellow in the Defence Studies
Department, King\'s College London, "Why won\'t Europeans use NATO and
the EU?" Friends of Europe, 3-19-2014,
<https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/why-wont-europeans-use-nato-and-the-eu/>
/GoGreen!

[Although regional MDCs have been proliferating]{.underline} and
strengthening in Europe, [they remain **fragile**]{.underline} and this
fragility will have a significant impact on the landscape of European
defence. The weakness of regional MDCs is that they are driven mostly by
national Ministries of Defence and do not have a well-grounded,
strategically sophisticated background for collaboration. Countries
often co-operate on defence issues without defining their common foreign
policy goals. T[his can undermine the raison d'être of defence
cooperation, even in the short-term, and cause significant problems in
situations where participating states of regional MDCs are divided on
the necessity of military action]{.underline}.

[Another difficulty for **[sub-regional]{.mark} MDCs** is
that]{.underline} although they face financial pressure to find
multinational partners to mitigate the capability decline of European
armed forces, [they **cannot develop these collaborations without
significant political and social support**. These problems of regional
MDCs may [have a **negative impact** on **defence
co-op**]{.mark}**eration [in NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU as
well, [because Ministries of Defence will be [**even less inclined** to
work together in **large organisations** **if** they **cannot**]{.mark}
**even succeed** [in **smaller**]{.mark} frameworks]{.underline}.
[[**However**, **if**]{.mark} these [difficulties can be
**overcome**]{.mark} by certain regional MDCs, the participating states
will have to bring their foreign policy goals closer to underpin their
co-operation. Accordingly, **[emerging]{.mark} regional [blocs]{.mark}**
may [become **more assertive**]{.mark} in achieving their goals,
[and]{.mark} thus **regional solidarity** [could **replace
transatlantic** or **pan-European solidarity** in **more and more**
cases]{.mark}. This may **[undermine]{.mark}** the relevance of
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU, [and result in a **much
weaker** EU]{.underline}.

[To avoid these outcomes, **NATO**]{.underline} and the EU [have to pay
more attention to the regional MDCs and must attempt to **channel the
results of regional MDCs into their processes as much as
possible**]{.underline}. [NATO has a **comparative advantage** in this
regard, as it possesses a much **more sophisticated and effective
defence planning system** (NATO Defence Planning Process --
NDPP)]{.underline} than the EU. [The NDPP is not perfect, but it
provides a **flexible enough instrument** to tackle multinational
military collaborations as it has **already done** with multinational
projects in the framework of the Smart Defence initiative]{.underline}.

[[**NATO** should]{.mark} therefore, via its NDPP, **support and
[embed]{.mark}** [the projects of **regional MDCs** **into its own
processes** and **ensure**]{.mark} that **[MDCs work to fulfil NATO
commitments]{.mark}** and contribute to the Level of Ambition of the
Alliance. [This]{.mark} way NATO could **[mitigate]{.mark}** the chance
of the [development of **regional interests**]{.mark} in Europe
[and]{.mark} at the same time [provide **political impetus** for
**regional MDCs** to **overcome**]{.mark} **the [hardships]{.mark}** of
day-to-day practical collaboration]{.underline}.

[For the last several years **NATO**]{.underline} and the EU have [tried
to **push** together countries 'artificially' to **make them
co-operate** on certain capability areas]{.underline}. [Yet, European
nations created and reenergised regional MDCs. Thus, **NATO
should**]{.underline} look to its other options and [rather **follow**
the **'organic' evolution** of European military collaborations and
**channel that into its defence planning process**]{.underline}.

### Perm: Do Both -- 1AR

#### CP alone trades off with NATO -- whether it solves or not

\--MDC = multinational defense cooperation

**Németh 14** Bence Németh, Teaching fellow in the Defence Studies
Department, King\'s College London, "Why won\'t Europeans use NATO and

<https://www.friendsofeurope.org/insights/why-wont-europeans-use-nato-and-the-eu/>
/GoGreen!

**[Instead of using NATO]{.underline}** and EU institutional frameworks,
[European nations have recently established a series of new regional
'multinational defence co-operations' (**MDCs**) and reenergised old
ones]{.underline}. Although policymakers and analysts support all kinds
of defence co-operation, they have not taken into consideration the
negative consequences of unstructured defence collaborations. For
instance, [**[if]{.mark}** the emerging regional [MDCs do **not prove
successful**, they **will hinder defence co-op**]{.mark}**eration** in
Europe [**in general**, including]{.mark} within
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU, [as nations [become **even
less willing** to work with **larger organisations**]{.mark} where
co-operation is **slower** and **more complicated**]{.underline}.

[[**However**, **if**]{.mark} these **[MDCs succeed]{.mark}**, they are
[likely to]{.mark} create common views and interests among regional
partners on defence issues, thereby strengthening regional bodies and
**[weaken]{.mark}ing [transatlantic ties]{.mark}** [and **pan-European
solidarity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, NATO and the EU should revise
their policies which attempt to foster defence co-operation based
exclusively on common military capability requirements, and should
instead focus on exploiting the changing European defence co-operation
landscape by channelling regional MDCs into their planning systems.

How to "read" the Russian reference to the missile shield

Of course, in what Moscow proposes here, Romania is included -- we can
read the anti-missile shield between the lines quite obviously. And not
because the Americans would like to withdraw it -- it is an
American-Romanian project, but it has been assimilated and legitimized
by NATO decisions. Let it be clear, it is a NATO project, it is not a
bilateral agreement, as I heard from a party in Romania, that we kissed
the ring of the Americans in 2013 (allusion to Călin Georgescu, honorary
president of AUR -- no. ).

Here the issue is very clear: Vladimir Putin does not want to discuss
arms control with the Americans, but political issues. [[Political
issues]{.mark}, Americans say, [are discussed in **NATO, not
bilaterally**]{.mark}. [Because **if**]{.mark} it is discussed
[**bilaterally**, in practice, the]{.mark} North Atlantic

among them is its heavy dependence on the European market. He cites the
example of Gazprom, the state-run gas company, whose supply of fuels to
Europe provides Russia with roughly two-thirds of its government
revenue.

Despite this impressive list, NATO's partnership mechanisms are not
currently achieving their full potential and are due for a rethink. Many
major issues are being neglected. This is not to say that partners no
longer play a role in NATO's operations and priorities. On the contrary,
some---such as Sweden and Finland--- are about as closely integrated in
NATO's planning as they could possibly be short of membership. But, as
is also true with Georgia and Ukraine, [most of these activities take
place in **[bilateral]{.mark}** or trilateral formats]{.underline},
although these countries are also part of other, larger partnership
frameworks.

[This [reality reveals]{.mark} some **[flaws]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
NATO's partnership policy. [There are not only **redundancies**, but
many of the broader frameworks have lost momentum and
purpose]{.underline}. [Many formats lack clear processes and goals,
lumping together diverse groups of nations that have very different
hopes and expectations in how they engage with NATO]{.underline}. In
addition, formats like the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul
Cooperation Initiative, which aim to catalyze broader cooperation beyond
the traditional Euro-Atlantic area, continue to fall short of their
intended purpose and lack a clear agenda for the future. [[While]{.mark}
these frameworks demonstrate their usefulness by [building]{.mark}
political ties and [**space for dialogue**, they are **less effective**
when it comes to **driving actual outcomes that benefit NATO's interests

Are [Europe and America having [**doubts** about]{.mark} their
**[decades-long habits]{.mark}** of common defence]{.underline}?
[America\'s ambassador to NATO darkly describes the current
spat]{.underline} between NATO and the European Union (and for that
matter within the EU itself), over what military things Europeans might
plot to do together and where they might plot them, [as "[one of the
**greatest dangers to the transatlantic
relationship**]{.mark}"]{.underline}. France, Germany, Belgium and
Luxembourg, who started the quarrel by announcing that the EU should
build its own operational-planning headquarters in Tervuren, a
previously inoffensive suburb of Brussels, claim that causing a rift in
the alliance could not be further from their minds. But more is at stake
than bricks and mortar. [How the row is settled **[will affect the way
Europe and America can work together in the
future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

They have supposedly already agreed on many of the basics: that
Europe\'s armies should boost their limited firepower, for example; and
that the EU should be able to act independently of NATO in cases where
the alliance, with right of first refusal, chooses not to be involved
itself. Indeed a painstakingly worked-out formula, finalised in March,
enables the EU to use NATO equipment for these sorts of military
operations, as is already happening in the Lilliputian mission the
Europeans have taken over from NATO in Macedonia. There is even general
agreement that the EU should be able to plan for its own military
operations.

The real disagreement is about how the Tervuren four want the EU to do
that---in its own headquarters, entirely separate from NATO. And the
Americans have been alarmed as much by the way the proposal came about
as by its content: the four, all sceptics of the Iraq war, cooked it up
at their own mini-summit in April, when tempers were still running high.
Disparaged at the time as a "chocolate soldier" summit, given the
limited military capabilities of its Belgian host, among others, the
meeting nevertheless made the Americans worry that Europe\'s defence
effort might start to evolve into a competitor to NATO, rather than as a
complement to it. All the more so, as it fits President Jacques
Chirac\'s recently expressed neo-Gaullist vision of a "multipolar"
world, one in which Europe could potentially be as much America\'s rival
as its ally.

Still more worrying, Britain\'s Tony Blair may have made concessions to
the neo-Gaullists at a get-together with Mr Chirac and Germany\'s
Gerhard Schröder last month. Perhaps to show goodwill in advance of the
wrangling over the draft European Union constitution, perhaps to seem to
distance himself a little from George Bush, Mr Blair was more hospitable
than Britain had previously seemed to the notion of independent
operational planning by the EU. He also appeared to agree that some EU
members should be allowed to push ahead on defence without the rest,
though he has been careful to insist that any advance party must be open
to others to join. He is clear, too, that Europe\'s defence efforts must
remain compatible with NATO\'s---and he has the support of a lot of
other European governments in that. He has therefore ruled out setting
up military shop in Tervuren. And he has so far shown no sign of giving
way to those who want the new EU constitution to contain a
mutual-defence clause, which could undermine NATO\'s status as the
ultimate guarantor of Europe\'s security.

Friendly fire

Mr Blair is right. The EU can already plan its own military operations,
whether using NATO kit (as in Macedonia), or that of France and Britain,
its two most militarily capable nations. The EU\'s mission in Congo, for
example, is being run from a French headquarters. Putting up a new
building for such purposes, at Tervuren or anywhere else, makes no
sense. If something more is needed, better---and safer---for the EU to
do its operational planning at NATO\'s existing military headquarters at
Mons, in Belgium. Both sets of planners will be calling on the same pool
of soldiers, making co-ordination essential. And it is more soldiers,
not more headquarters to order them about, that Europe needs. What is
more, if an EU operation should ever go wrong, and NATO is called in to
help, common procedures would put fewer soldiers\' lives at risk.

[The [Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, are also at fault. The
Bush administration has itself [recently seemed intent on **[dividing
NATO]{.mark}** into allies and irritants. This [**gives the impression**
that it prefers]{.mark} strong Europeans to a strong Europe. It wants
well-armed [countries with whom it can **work bilaterally instead of
turning first to NATO**]{.mark}. [What a pity if "**friendly
fire**]{.mark}" were to **[fell]{.mark}** what is still [the]{.mark}
most successful **military [alliance]{.mark}** in history]{.underline}.

Even immediately following the attacks, when for the first time in its

Three other limitations or gaps have been raised in numerous discussions
with SC personnel in DoD. We indicated above that [**DoD** has been
**limited**]{.underline} in some authorities [to **working only with**
foreign forces associated with **national defense agencies**.
**[Emerging]{.mark}** transnational **[threats]{.mark} and mission
areas** **[require]{.mark}** the [ability to work with]{.mark} interior
agency forces or other gendarme or civil authorities when their security
forces retain primary responsibility for those mission areas or operate
in close collaboration with MoDs]{.underline}. For example, in many
cases, the ministry or department of interior is responsible for
securing national infrastructure and cyber assets; of six countries
CENTCOM officials are engaging on infrastructure security, only in
Jordan is the military responsible for protecting the country's
infrastructure.66

[A second gap in Title 10 authorities is in the flexibility for DoD to
work with [**regional organizations** rather than just
**bilaterally**]{.mark} with national governments. Under **Title 10**,
even regional programs]{.underline} (such as the Counterterrorism
Partnership Fund \[CTPF\]) [are implemented **bilaterally** with
national governments. There are **no mechanisms** for training and
equipping **regional organizations**]{.underline}.67 When this
limitation is combined with the limitation on U.S. military engagement
with non-MoD security forces, [it **[inhibits]{.mark}** the U.S.
**[ability to facilitate coordination]{.mark}** among agencies with
similar responsibilities [within and across partners]{.mark} to have
regional effects and [to address]{.mark} local [security
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.68

Finally, while Section 1206 and the subsequent Section 2282 were
designed to be a more rapid means of building partner capacity than
traditional Title 22 authorities like FMF and FMS, even these programs
take some 12-18 months to deliver equipment to partners. A number of SC
stakeholders in DoD still perceive a need for more "timely assistance"
to partners who require small amounts of support to recover or enhance
existing capability of their "forces in the fight."69 Currently, these
stakeholders point out, a "pseudo-FMS" case for \$10,000 in truck
springs takes the same amount of time to process as a major item of

Summary of DoD Perceptions of Title 10 SC Authorities

In sum, DoD has been able to achieve many of its SC objectives with the
patchwork of Title 10 authorities, but the proliferation of authorities
and the complexities they engender have rendered them exceedingly
difficult to apply. As we have noted here and in previous research,
authorities are not the only reason for the frustration expressed by SC
personnel; internal processes, organizational relationships,
programmatic requirements, and inadequate levels of funding have also
created obstacles. But the existing catalog of Title 10 authorities in
some ways drives or complicates these other factors when they present
the challenges in planning and execution detailed above. [What
[many]{.mark} in the DoD SC community **[perceive]{.mark}** as [a
**flawed legislative foundation**]{.mark} [has]{.mark} had [a
**compounding impact** on]{.mark} the administration and [**management**
of **SC programs**]{.mark}, systems, and processes]{.underline}.

The development of this new European strategic approach reveals [a
**constant tension** between two political centres]{.underline}, within
which engagement in collaborative crisis management can happen. That of
Brussels, calling for [further security and defence
integration]{.underline}, while cooperating [with **NATO**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} that of capable and willing European [member states
interested in preserving their **sovereignty** and **strategic
autonomy**]{.underline}. [These developments towards what **sometimes
appears** to generate **conflicting** courses of action, has produced a
**layered system** where cooperation occurs in different configurations.
These configurations coexist and sometimes compete with formal
organizations such as]{.underline} the EU/CSDP and [NATO]{.underline}
and the cooperative framework that result from EU-NATO Joint
Declarations of 2016 and 2018. [This system of security governance is a
three-layered system where **multilateralism**, **minilateralism** and
strategic **bilateralism** **coexist**]{.underline}, allowing
participants to accommodate goals, benefits and security practices that
emanate at the EU and NATO level, with those driven by particular
national interests.

Each serves a different collaborative purpose. Multilateralism20 in the
framework of cooperative security arrangements comprehends a majority of
participants in a given security regime21 for instance that of the UN,
NATO or EU, leading to the development of formal and long-lasting
cooperation and coordination among states and organizations. Conversely,
minilateralism comprises a few like-minded and willing participants,
with similar national interests and approaches to foreign and security
policy, as well as identical operational output. Distinctive from
multilateralism and minilateralism, "strategic bilateralism" (Renard
2016, p. 14) involves particular forms of selective engagement of
strategically able and willing participants with self-interested motives
in converging security views and policies, whether those are defence and
security policies or security issue-based concerns such as terrorism,
cyber or hybrid threats.

Being beyond the scope of this paper, [these security configurations
offers analytical space to **empirical research** allowing to **test**
in which conditions, how this coexistence **strengthens** or conversely
**weakens** cooperative security and how it impacts on EuroAtlantic
security]{.underline}. The inclusion of [a **multilateralist focus** in
major political and strategic documents, such as the]{.underline} Treaty
of Lisbon, the European Security Strategy (Council of the European Union
2003), the EU Global Strategy (High Representative 2016) and
[**[NATO]{.mark}** Strategic Concept]{.underline} (North Atlantic
Council 2010) [[is]{.mark} accompanied by references to [a **normative**
and **ruled based multilateral stand**]{.mark}, on which]{.underline}
both the EU and [**NATO** are founded and [from which they **draw
legitimacy** for]{.mark} their external action in [**crisis management**
and **conflict resolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[This **constitutive base**]{.mark} for common security and collective
action has also been **[shap]{.mark}ing** the base for **[cooperative
output]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the two organizations, having the
EU's interpretation of multilateralism, a normative and regulative
emphasis that binds individual to common interests and obligations,
while promoting "issue-based engagements" (Council of the European Union
2019, § 8 and 9) preferred by Member States and partners. Since 2016, an
officially assumed interest-based approach to security and defence can
be identified in several EU documents, such as the EU Global Strategy,
the European Commission statements on the launch of the European Defence
Fund or in the process leading to the institutionalisation of a
Directorate General for Defence. Such initiatives may also translate
what seems to be a more strategic European approach to new concepts,
such as resilience or ownership22, while "principled pragmatism" appears
as the new guiding principle for common foreign, security and defence
policy, to use the expression adopted by the EU Global Strategy itself.

In the EU context, this emerging security governance discourse and
practice based on effective multilateralism seeks to help confirming the
Union as a security provider. [First, it **legitimises** and reiterates
the international stand]{.underline} of the European Union [through
**international law**, on the base of **values**, but also of
**interests** that constitute a given multilateral
structure]{.underline}. [Second, it **informs** a normative and
**regulative basis** for **internal and external relations** of Member
States by reducing the space between these two levels of
security]{.underline}. [Third, it sets a **comprehensive platform** of
cooperative engagement to **harmonize implementation** of guidelines, to
improve coordination and to enhance cooperation at different levels: the
international, the regional and the local]{.underline}. Fourth, in those
non-juridically binding policy domains or on those areas which fall
outside the aquis communautaire, it offers the opportunity for willing
compliance among Member States (Nunes 2018). Due to the EU institutional
design, with multi-level decision making levels, complex formal
decision-making structure and wide-ranging external relations,
[**multilateralism** offers a **broader** multi-layered and
**trans-sectoral scope** for policy action. It comprehends diverse
policy domains with security implications from crisis management to
humanitarian and development aid, adding to security new themes such as
**cyberspace** or climate change and making available different policy
instruments, whether one refers to those of trade, foreign policy,
security and more recently defence]{.underline}. The EU forms a regional
order, within which the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and
CSDP constitute a security regime shared by Member States, where the EU
leads various multilateral processes (Ujvari 2016, p. 2) from trade to
development. [In a European context, multilateralism also means a system
of governance within]{.underline} which traditional actors such as the
UN, **[NATO]{.underline}** and African Union coexist with emergent
actors like China or India or [with **decision-making
frameworks**]{.underline}23 [such as the **North Atlantic
Council**]{.underline}.

Multilateralism has been a cross cutting theme in the EU and NATO policy
documents.24 [Being **suggested by some as hindering** national
interest, it is acknowledged by others as a prevailing governance
system. This **[despite]{.mark}** a tendency for
**[bilateralization]{.mark}** of policies, manifestation of preference
for intergovernmental decision-making methods or **regionalization** of
security and defence through **minilateralism** of security and defence
initiatives]{.underline}, as explained further ahead. [Multilateral
platforms, such as **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU, [[favour
**jointness of action** and **harmonization of understandings**]{.mark}
**on security**. **Despite** the presence of **other cooperative
configurations**, it is **[still a lasting method of
coop]{.mark}eration** in the euro-atlantic context for several
reasons]{.underline}. [First, it is likely to gain support for
**legitimacy** reasons adding normative guidance and
**representativeness** to security practice, due to the number of
participants involved, serving both common and particular
interests]{.underline}. In June 2019, the European Council Conclusions
describes it as ["the **best way** to advance national, as well as
collective interests"]{.underline} (Council of the European Union 2019,
§ 2). [Second, for reasons of **self-regulation** of security and
defence relations among participants, predisposing them to
self-restrain, as opposed to "more common unilateral and less restrained
methods"]{.underline} (Jervis 1985, p. 59). [Third, for **facilitating
ad hoc access to resources** and security and defence goods, such as
common or collective knowledge, expertise and capabilities]{.underline}.

The minilateralist configuration of security and defence cooperation is
characterised by cooperative arrangements among like-minded countries,
for instance in the EU case under the form of "Pooling & Sharing"
initiatives or "Smart Defence" in the case of NATO, gathering
strategically able countries. It may occur within the EU and NATO or
outside them. Minilateralism means a "diplomatic process of a small
group of interested parties working together to supplement or complement
the activities of international organizations in tackling subjects
deemed too complicated to be addressed appropriately at the multilateral
level" (Moret 2016, p. 2). This means that being a more flexible
configuration, than formal multilateral agreements, located within
security and defence organizations, it may generate better adherence and
compliance from interested participants. In the security and defence
domain, minilateralism gathers politically willing, self-interested and
militarily able actors in order to advance what Member States perceive
to be more difficult to achieve within the binding framework of security
and defence organizations. In the European context, minilateralist
alternatives are not a novelty being envisaged (Nunes 2018, pp. 53-55)
in the Lisbon Treaty through: the mechanism of "Enhanced Cooperation"
(TEU Article 327) in the domain of the Union's non-exclusive
competences; through the 2017 Council Decision (Council Decision (CFSP),
2017/ 2315),which set forward a Permanent Structured Cooperation among
willing and able Member States and through the provision of a "Framework
Nation" concept, TEU Article 43 (1), through which the Union will retain
political control and strategic direction, while entrusting "specific
responsibilities" or tasks to a Member State in the context of a EU-led
missions and operations.25 In operational terms, minilateralism
translates into a process of aggregated and shared capabilities, as
referred earlier in the context of "Pooling & Sharing" or NATO's "Smart
Defence".

In NATO's case, due to its issue specific nature, minilateralism is
invoked in a different manner. It describes a configuration meant to
address transnational military and non-military challenges from
stabilisation operations to counter cyber and hybrid threats, often
positioned at the upper end of defence tasks due to its operational
demands. It can also adopt the format of coalitions of the willing26
where some, but not all, of the Alliance members engage in the pursuit
of security and defence goals.27 In this case, it serves the purpose of
a more rapid response to threats, with less formal legal boundaries and
complex decision-making procedures derived from international law, as
those mandatory to the United Nations and EU led-operations or from the
constitutive norms of the Washington Treaty, to which the Alliance
abides by when acting collectively.

Changes in the nature of security, the transnational consequences of
insecurity and the growing selective interdependence of interests among
security actors led to a renewed interest in minilateralism. Due to the
fact it gathers a smaller number of participants, it is better able to
promote convergence of security interests and approaches, to accelerate
responses to crises and to improve force generation, thus reducing the
impact of security dilemmas, as perceived by states and security
communities (Nunes 2017a, p. 18). This is even more relevant in complex
security contexts, where different interests and preferences prevail in
the face of multiple security challenges and in times of scarce
resources.

The "strategic bilateralism"28 although it may occur within multilateral
structures, such as international organizations, it also evolves outside
the intergovernmental structures of the EU crisis management setting and
that of the Alliance's collective defence. In these cases, international
and regional institutions may offer what Renard notes (2016, p. 31) as
the role of "framing and institutionalizing cooperation (...) and
occasionally in complementing member States, rather than substituting
for them". More often this cooperative configuration denotes a will, as
in the case of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada and the
United States to favour agreements at bilateral level that safeguard
traditional foreign policy interests, outside and without the scrutiny
of multilateral fora. Mattelaer (2019, p. 13) considers that the
"prominence of bilateral diplomacy represents a symptom rather than a
cause of change in the international system". The revival of bilateral
diplomacy can be observed in a wide variety of formats from the
formality of the Lancaster House Treaty between Great Britain and
France,29 following the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty a year
earlier30 to the launch in June 2018 of the French led European
Intervention Initiative31 or the Franco-Danish Defence Cooperation,
known as the European Initiative2 (EI2)32 that followed the Council
Decision of 2017, establishing the first EU Council Decision initiative
on Permanent Structured Cooperation. The EI2 enabled Denmark to
contribute to European security and defence, outside the PESCO
arrangement.33 Lastly, the Achen Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation and
Integration, signed on the 22 January 201934 through which the two
countries agreed to "deepen their cooperation in matters of foreign
policy, defence, external and internal security and development, while
striving to strengthen Europe's ability to act autonomously" (Aachen
Treaty, 2019, Article 3). Although these initiatives have been agreed
outside the European Union and NATO they aim at strengthening them, as
referred in the preamble or provisions foresee in those declarations,
while furthering the specific interests and preferences of contracting
parts.

Being a common practice in international affairs, these three examples:
the Lancaster House Treaty, the European Intervention Initiative35 and
the Aachen Treaty36 occur in time, almost simultaneously to other
initiatives agreed with the aim to deepen European security and defence
cooperation, such as PESCO, CARD, the European Defence Fund and the
setup of a DG Defence within the European Commission. This does not
necessarily mean distrust by Member States on the political strength,
binding nature or operational output of security and defence initiatives
launched within the European Union. Strategic bilateralism supplement
and is even "conducive to stronger multilateral cooperation" (Grevi
2012, p. 16). It may suggest that multilateral initiatives agreed in
intergovernmental fora, only some of which legally binding like PESCO
and with the regulative and financial weigh of the European Commission,
such as the European Defence Fund, do not exclude the necessity of
alternative cooperative configurations, capacities and operational
output that multilateral institutions are unable, or unwilling, to
deliver as a whole, for reasons of political interest, contextual
opportunity and availability of military and non-military resources.

4\. Contexts of Opportunity for EU-NATO Cooperation

The point of debate on capability gap still holds true, whether when
comparing defence expenditures among the EU NATO member states in the
Alliance context, Europe as a whole or between Europe and the United
States.37

Twenty years later, the American political and very public discourse
calling for greater strategic responsibility by European allies,
coincided with the European Union's claim for more strategic autonomy,
following the presentation of the European Global Strategy, the launch
of several European cooperative endeavours38 and the development of
several bilateral security and defence initiatives, led by strategically
strong EU member states.39

In 2016 the lack of formal endorsement of NATO's collective defence by
the President of the United States was aggravated by the doubts casted
over the ability of European allies to allocate resources and commit to
defence in the transatlantic context. This caused a perception of
political, diplomatic and strategic "devaluation of the alliance", in
the sense attributed by Glen Snyder (1984, p. 467) and posed
self-interested conditionalities to allies, beyond the 2% of defence
spending target. Although, as Snyder (1984, p. 491) years earlier
accurately assessed, the European allies should avoid the "risk of
entrapment (consisting of) troop withdrawals, American downgrading of
the priority of European defence in favour of other areas such as the
Persian Gulf, or a further drift to unilateralism"40. These were exactly
some of the decisions adopted and initiatives taken by President Trump,
as from the earlier years of his presidency. In 2019, during the Munich
Security Conference41 former Vice President Joseph Biden, and a
potential running candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2020
Presidential election, did reiterate full support to NATO and to its
allies conveying a firm belief in the principle of collective defence.
This position was supported by the majority of the forty-five democratic
senators in the United States Senate, by various senior military
representatives at the Department of Defense, at the Pentagon and senior
diplomats and officials in Brussels, proving different perceptions
within the American political establishment. Despite the rhetoric, the
US has been increasing its commitment to Europe's eastern flank, as the
account by the Department of Defense Budget on the European Deterrence
Initiative demonstrates.42

It was in a political environment of mutual political distrust,
rhetorical and diplomatic controversy, of strained relations between
Washington and most European capitals, of fears of rising nationalism in
France, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Hungary and the announced
withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, that a second attempt43 to
formally enhance EU-NATO cooperation took place.

Despite the instability felt in Europe's neighbourhood and the
destabilizing effects caused by the consecutive interventions in Middle
East, by the regime change in Libya and by the course of American and
Russian foreign policy, the European and euroatlantic institutions
proved resilient44 to contingencies sourced in the personality of
national decision-makers and on the hindrances of party politics.

A realization that the EU-NATO cooperation was an imperative followed
two major challenges to transatlantic unity. On the one hand, the
coalition force that intervene in Kosovo (North Atlantic Council 1999a
and 1999b) with NATO, despite the absence of a United Nations mandate.
On the other, the American intervention in Afghanistan, at a time when
the United States declined to accept the possibility to invoke Article
5, in reaction to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 200145.

The 2003 EU-NATO Declaration46 paved the way to the so-called
development of a "strategic partnership" (Renard 2016b) between the EU
and NATO. This led to the Berlin Plus agreement, opening the opportunity
to the European Union to use NATO's command and control collective
structure and to institutionalise forms of cooperation and political
consultation between the two organizations in the field of crisis
management and capability development on fight against terrorism,
organized crime and cybersecurity.

In 2016, the need to foster better EU and NATO cooperation was in part a
reaction to two exogenous events. On the one hand, the potential wearing
down of transatlantic relations in the face of growing defence spending,
following the unilateral involvement of some allied countries in the
Syrian conflict and in military operations in the context of fight
against ISIS. On the other, due to a continuous ambivalence in relations
between the United States, the EU and NATO sourced in the political and
strategic narrative of American administrations against the development
of European defence integration. The notion of European Security and
Defence Identity or that of a NATO's European pillar47 prevailed over a
more autonomous European defence, while the very same administrations
pressed for a more independent operational output of European allies,
higher defence spending and stronger commitment of Europeans to NATO's
military operations.

Despite the potential for disagreement between the two organizations,
contextual events did prove their adaptability to the changing strategic
environment. NATO evolved from out-of-area to a new military stance with
the return to European and transatlantic core defence functions, after
the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The EU/CSDP, although without
abandoning its security interests towards the near neighbourhood, turned
its security focus to the protection of its citizens, to a more
efficient response to external crises and called for better commitment
towards regional security and capacity building of partners, leading to
stronger resilience and committed ownership.48 These almost simultaneous
processes of adaptation were accompanied by a closer relation among
allies, centred on the principle of "effective multilateralism" and
strategic complementarity, contradicting the idea of competition and
duplication between the two organizations. This is a reserve frequently
expressed among policy makers and analysts, although it has been
formally addressed and solved within both organizations.

From an early stage, EU actors have denied the idea of competing or
duplicating security and defence projects by stating that CSDP will act
"where NATO as a whole is not or does not wish to get involved", a
concern repeatedly underlined since the 2001 Laeken EU Council and
reiterated in the Lisbon Treaty (Treaty of Lisbon 2007). More recently a
statement adopted by the European Defence Agency assured that "no
capacity duplication with other institutions such as NATO" would happen,
stressing that PESCO would develop as a "coherent full spectrum force
package" (EDA 2018, p. 4) in complementarity with NATO. This intention
was also reiterated by the "Implementation Plan for Security and
Defence", by the "European Defence Action Plan" and by the "Notification
letter on PESCO to the Council and High Representative". This concern
with avoiding the idea of duplication is also mirrored at the bilateral
level among those which are strategically more capable. Recent
agreements between actors such as France and Germany, as in the case of
the Achen Treaty in its Article 4, emphasises that the bilateral
commitment to reinforce cooperation between France and Germany,
regarding European security and defence is taken "In light of their
obligations under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty of 4 April 1949
and of Article 42 (7) of the Treaty on European Union of 7 February
1992, as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon of 13 December 2007 amending
the Treaty on European Union" (Achen Treaty, 2019, Article 4 (1))
formally refuting any interpretations on duplication.

In July 2016, in Warsaw, the President of the European Council, the
President of the European Commission and NATO's Secretary General signed
an EU-NATO Joint Declaration on how to further cooperation between the
two organizations. This initiative was followed in December, of the same
year, by an agreement on a common set of proposals to implement "EU-NATO
Joint Declaration" (2016) by endorsing 42 proposals in the 7 areas
agreed: defence capabilities; capacity building; industry and research;
cyber security; hybrid threats, operational cooperation and exercises.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the 2016 agreement "a
milestone in our relations," recognising that "neither organisation has
the full range of tools" to address new security and defence challenges
unilaterally (NATO Meeting Ministers of Foreign Affairs 2016).

In December 2017 the Council of the European Union49 would underline the
necessity to implement the Joint Declaration reinforcing cooperation at
the strategic and operational levels between the EU and NATO. A
particular interest was placed on the collaboration between the European
Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats¸ staff level
cooperation on threat assessment regarding terrorism and on how to
counter terrorist threats. The identification of gender indicators and
assessments on how they could improve situational awareness, in support
of the UNSCR 1325 agreed in 2000, were also addressed. It was agreed to
promote EU and NATO staff presence in advisory and preparedness bodies
for missions of the respective organizations and better coordination of
EU-NATO exercises.

In 2018 a EU-NATO Joint Declaration was signed reiterating the interest
and noting the progress achieved on what regards military mobility,
counter-terrorism, cyber security, hybrid threats, resilience to
chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear related risks and
promoting the women, peace and security agenda. This was followed by the
attendance of the new High Representative Josep Borrell to NATO Defence
Ministerial meeting. At the operational level there is a continuous
cooperative effort in the Aegean Sea, where NATO has six ships helping
to implement the agreement between the EU and Turkey on the refugee
crisis, as well as support to Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean.50
This measures and actions reflect the particular security and defence
concerns of both organizations and how NATO and the EU may contribute to
mitigate them. Coherence, complementarity and interoperability remain
the three main drivers for EU-NATO cooperation and the only acceptable
and feasible in times of limited budgets and increasing new challenges
to security and defence.

However, the cumulative nature of the process of cooperation that result
from the EU-NATO Joint Declarations cooperation, rather than phased and
incremental, may be counterproductive for three reasons. First, for
reasons of capacity availability and funding. Second due to the length
of national legislative cycles, which may limit the political
willingness of Member States to pursue, in a sustainable manner, new
cooperative engagements once the political cycle has changed. Third, and
as Verbeke notes (2017, p. 5), structural projects such as those related
with states "Long term strategic interests or investments (such as
energy infrastructure or major defence platforms) are neglected in
favour of short-term tactical advantages or pet projects". This trend
may compromise the binding effect of more structural commitments, agreed
within multilateral arrangements, such as NATO and the EU.

Each Member State encloses very specific political, strategic,
diplomatic and security cultures, distinct historical legacies and
operational output. This may be determinant on how security and defence
cooperation moves forward and how Member States and participant states
accommodate alternative frameworks in multilateral, minilateral and
bilateral settings, adjusting to new processes of security governance.
Connected societies are as prone to accountability as they are to the
immediacy of results, a demand that fits poorly to the required
long-term test to which regional and international cooperation is
exposed to, in order to prove resilience to external challenges and
efficient output in the face of change.

5\. [[**Advantages** of]{.underline}]{.mark} EU-[**[NATO]{.mark}**
Cooperation]{.underline}

Despite considerable improvements leading to better institutionalization
of cooperation, between the EU and NATO, academic and policy debates are
still focused on traditional divides, which can be systematized in two
approaches: on how to address and manage security problems. Those that,
in the words of Glenn Snyder (1984:489), postulate the effectiveness of
"toughness and confrontation" and those who value a "strategy of
conciliation". This divide has been characterising the cooperative
stance between the two organizations for decades and those of Member
States foreign relations. To a certain extent, this dichotomy affects
both the analytical and strategic approach, when addressing
Euro-Atlantic security and defence relations. This varies from a
persistent concern with the division of strategic work among European
and non-European allies (Yost, 2000 and 2007); to the problem of
strategic and financial burden sharing (Kivimäki 2019; Jakobsen 2018;
National Defence Strategy 2018) and to the conditionality that results
in the fact European defence will only be welcomed by the United States
and by the more Atlanticist allies, if and when it strengthens NATO
(Brattberg 2018; BillonGalland and Thomson 2018; Leonard and Shapiro
2019). The specific concern with division of strategic work in a NATO
context and the reluctance of some Member States to embrace role
specialisation of certain security and defence tasks at the European
level, has evolved into a new perception on the disagreements registered
among allies on the Alliance collective share of risks and defence
expenses versus selective common investments in European security and
defence, through Permanent Structured Cooperation. The two moments of
strategic strain in 2003 and 2016, did not impair Euro-Atlantic
cooperation and despite concerns with duplication and competition,
developments have shown that complementarity between the two
organizations is valued the most.51

Several circumstances have been enabling better opportunities for
cooperation between the EU and NATO. First, contextual related reasons
such as the emergence of hybrid threats in the Eastern Europe, the
threat of potential and actual external interferences on allied
countries internal affairs, the consequences of the refugee crisis over
European unity and the uncertainties caused by the British referendum.52
To this already long list, one must add the internal and regional
consequences of the conflict in Syria, the position of President Donald
Trump regarding NATO and the EU creating a perception of existential
threat the long and well succeed transatlantic alliance. On the one
hand, it led to the claim that Europe should aim at a stronger role in
the security and defence of Europe. On the other, that that strengthened
position would only be supported if and when it reinforced NATO. In the
face of current security challenges, unforeseeable outcomes of
insecurity, limited resources and greater interdependency related with
the consequences of uncertainty, the development of cooperation, rather
than competition, is an expected outcome for relations among states and
within international organizations. The deterioration of insecurity in
North Africa, following the collapse of Muammar al-Gaddafi's regime in
Libya, the downfall of the so called Islamic state in the Middle East,
the consequences of revisionist foreign policies and the spread of
terrorist acts in Europe point to the diversity of sources of insecurity
and to the necessity for a more efficient and distinct form of security
and defence cooperation53, of which military cooperation is just a part.
Closer functional cooperation between the EU and NATO may help to better
deal with the uncertainties of systemic insecurity in Eastern Europe and
on the South and South-eastern rim of the Mediterranean, offering the
opportunity to safeguard distinct national and international security
interests. Decision makers and international bureaucracies should
endorse what Member States do better, whether that is crisis response or
conflict management, fight against terrorism, maritime security and
mitigation of cyber and hybrid threats, according to different strategic
cultures and interests, while fostering ownership and cooperation in
response to security challenges.

Second, [collaborative practice strives better in institutional
environments where international **socialization** among security and
defence actors is **high**]{.underline}. [In strongly connected
structures political, **[public scrutiny]{.mark}** may turn
**collaborative practice** into an instrument that [adds
**legitimacy**]{.mark}, [**better mobilizes public and political will**
and creates **more favourable conditions** to **resource**]{.mark}
security and defence agencies, such as **NATO**]{.underline} and the
EU-CSDP. NATO and the EU gather relevant strategic players, share a high
degree of membership overlap and their international security mandates
have a specific focus on European security and defence interests. This
brings into Euro-Atlantic collaborative practice both an element of
representativeness of interests and a dimension of legitimacy.

Third, power shifts in the international system may lead to changes in
the nature of security, opening up a new range of tasks for
international organizations beyond their original mandate, from military
missions to operations-other-than-war, to humanitarian relief, organized
crime eradication and disaster relief. This is reflected in new security
tasks, but also in new mobilizing arguments in the way security roles
are performed, such as preventive security, pre-emptive military action,
mitigation of hybrid threats and crisis response, rather than classical
military offensive, an option that governments and public opinions
appear to be less inclined to support. New role prescriptions not only
demand new military and non-military responses, but also a security
discourse that appeals to cooperative action, combining international
law, centred on value-based principles and arguments that serve national
interests, while suggesting further functional integration on security
and defence. Role specialisation may be an "asset" on demand given that
not all armed and security forces can afford to have the full spectrum
of capabilities required to mitigate current challenges and threats.

The institutionalisation of new forms of cooperative security, as
established between the EU-NATO, by the corresponding declarations on
cooperation of 2003, 2016 and 2018, underline the need to share risks
and responsibilities in specific security levels, notably in the context
of hybrid threats, maritime security to mitigate illegal trafficking of
human beings and search and rescue of irregular migrants at sea. A good
example of EU-NATO cooperation at the operational level was developed in
the Horn of Africa to counter maritime piracy54, together with missions
in land with the aim to develop capacity building on maritime security,
in coastal areas in the region. Other cooperative efforts were developed
in 2016, through Operation Sophia, with the aim to lessen the challenges
posed by the refugee crisis in the Aegean Sea, in combination with the
support given to the Turkish and Greek authorities and the support made
available by EU FRONTEX. In each of these missions and operations, both
NATO and the EU moved from traditional security and defence in the far
border, to counter-piracy and irregular migration in the near border.

The fourth advantage of enhancing security and defence cooperation
between the EU and NATO results from the fact that, [organizations and
the states that incorporate them commit to cooperative frameworks for
reasons of **[easier access to specialized knowledge]{.mark},
information [and resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Currently, the EU
[as]{.underline} already access to [**command** and **planning**
structures of **NATO**]{.underline}, under the Berlin Plus agreement and
in the future it can be envisaged an eventual access of NATO to the
EU-CSDP specific civilian proficiencies of the European crisis response
toolkit. The development of both the EU CSDP Civilian Compact (Council
of the European Union 2018) and the projects developed under Permanent
Structured Cooperation (Council Decision 2017) may contribute to develop
European actors roles, knowledge and experience on civilian crisis
management, while supplementing the amount of resources needed among
participant states in crisis prevention, conflict resolution and in
post-conflict situations.

[For cooperation to happen [**political will** and **trust** must be
present]{.mark}. These conditions are **[not mere technical
arrangements]{.mark}**, sometimes not even financial ones, they are a
choice that shapes the opportunity to engage collective. The
participation in new **[cooperative security frameworks]{.mark}** in
"conditions of confidence building, transparency, information
availability and knowledge"]{.underline} (Nunes 2006, p. 89), [[enable
**institutional mimetism**]{.mark} to strive among organizations, thus
**[facilitating coop]{.mark}eration** [or]{.mark} conversely
[creating]{.mark} a situation of [**perceived competition** for
**mandates** and **resources**]{.mark}. In the case of **NATO**, there
is a **growing appeal**]{.underline} among allies for it to perform
civilian security tasks for which the Alliance was not originally
created, as a political and military organization. In the case of
EU-CSDP, one observes an increasing institutionalization of conditions
aiming at a better operational deliver, following the approval of a
Security and Defence Action Plan (European Council 2016) and the
agreement on Permanent Structured Cooperation.55

Lastly, [[the fact]{.underline}]{.mark} both
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the EU [[are **politically
integrated** and **highly socialised**]{.mark}
organizations]{.underline}, bound by similar norms and interests,
[[makes]{.mark} political cooperation an opportunity and the prospect of
**[more efficient]{.mark}** operational [**collective engagement**
**more likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cooperation is [expected to
**work better**]{.mark} in an **interdependent security
environment**]{.underline}, where multiple memberships to organizations
are present and where resources scarcity or uneven distribution of
resources occurs [turning cooperation into a **more advantageous** and
**less costly** alternative]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- Norm-Setting

#### Counterplan forfeits NATO's [norm-setting power]{.underline}

[But **ad hoc** approaches also **pose challenges** to]{.underline}
organizations like **[NATO]{.underline}**. [Madeleine Albright warned
against]{.underline} the "three Ds" in the 1990s when she highlighted
[the risks of [**de-linking** from]{.mark}, or **duplicating [NATO
efforts]{.mark}**, as well as **discriminating** among
members]{.underline}.24 [These issues remain an important
concern---particularly in U.S. policy discussions -- when it comes to
more recent ad hoc or minilateral formats focused on European
defense]{.underline}. A more concerted NATO role in guiding flexible
efforts within the alliance could help address this concern to minimize
redundancies and buttress cohesion.

[NATO should work as much as possible with members]{.underline} and
partners [to ensure minilateral formats complement, rather than compete
with, the alliance]{.underline}. Moreover, NATO should consider how it
can more effectively apply the lessons of these formats to its
partnership policy to craft a more flexible approach. This includes
lessons from previous efforts to create flexible formats within the
alliance.

There are few metrics to evaluate a model's success. In many ways,
weighing the differences between minilateral arrangements outside larger
multilateral frameworks and flexible formats inside them is tantamount
to comparing apples and oranges. But there are a few factors that are
instructive, including mutual interest in cooperation, shared threat
perceptions and security priorities (which are often aligned with
geographic location), and a high level of ambition of all involved
participants. Moreover, on a procedural level, clear, defined goals and
a focus on outputs, coupled with regular consultations, can help drive
success. Ad hoc formats with lean and focused structures that are built
around voluntary participation allow for quicker responses---especially
in crisis situations---but they may be less suited to driving and
verifying success on long term deliverables and capability goals.

Flexible formats embedded within NATO, like the FNC and the NATO+N
model, or alongside NATO in the case of PESCO can increase agility for
member and partner cooperation. [But the **diminishing
enthusiasm**]{.underline} around the German FNC and challenges
surrounding PESCO funding [indicate **continued hurdles**]{.underline}.
The NATO+N model has proven effective in engaging two or three partners
around common regional security challenges (for example, NATO members,
Finland, and Sweden). Yet, [its limits [risk a **default
bilateralization**]{.mark}]{.underline} or trilateralization [of NATO's
engagement with partners [and]{.mark} may **[fail to leverage a broader
capacity]{.mark}** of partnerships]{.underline}.

In its effort to create greater political cohesion in Euro-Atlantic
defense, NATO cannot ignore the application and improvement of its
flexible partnership engagement. The [tendency of NATO
members]{.underline} and partners [to participate in various
**minilateral** formats [has **significant implications**]{.mark}. If
NATO cannot figure out how to engage partners more effectively and
flexibly, they and members may **increasingly** be **inclined** to
engage in various **minilateral** formats rather than NATO or simply
pursue **bilateral** ties. In this context, **[NATO]{.mark}**
partnerships could [end up as **little more than a "talk shop,"**
**forfeiting**]{.mark} the alliance's **[agenda-setting
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- Political Sustainability

#### Counterplan [tanks public support for NATO]{.underline} -- key to [sustain U.S. membership]{.underline}

and US Foreign Policy: Where's the Multilateralism?" International

[Policymakers tend to assume that foreign aid can attract public support
only to the extent that it is perceived to serve narrowly focused
national interests. Yet]{.underline}, the 1995 survey found that
humanitarian rationales for aid attracted the strongest support.
Americans were less inclined to favor aid programs designed to reward
friendly countries or to win economic benefits for US business.
**[[Military aid]{.underline}]{.mark}** was also **[[quite
unpopular]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But majorities ranging from 74% to 91%
wanted to maintain or increase aid devoted to ends such as child
survival, humanitarian relief, repairing the environment, family
planning, and long-term economic development. There existed strong
support for targeting aid toward the poorest countries. Americans were
skeptical, however, that aid actually reaches those who need it or
achieves humanitarian aims. Roughly 80% of respondents believed that too
much aid went to undemocratic regimes, that aid is plagued by waste and
corruption, and that foreign assistance programs often foster dependence
on the part of recipients.11

One obvious implication of these findings is that advocates for
increased foreign aid would do well to correct public misperceptions
that the United States is bearing a disproportionate burden as compared
with other aid-giving countries. Yet, research conducted by the Aspen
Institute suggests that the problem is more complicated: ''When
informants were confronted with such information, they showed momentary
surprise, and then reverted to their old patterns of reasoning. A core
rule of strategic frame analysis is at play here: if the facts don't fit
the frame, it is the facts that are rejected, not the frame'' (Bales
2001:8).

A better strategy for mobilizing public support for aid is to emphasize
America's shared responsibility to respond to human suffering in concert
with others. This approach shifts the focus from interests to values and
assures members of the public that the burden is not borne by the United
States alone. [Funneling [increasing]{.mark} proportions of US [aid
through **bilateral rather than multilateral** mechanisms]{.mark}
actually [**undercuts the appeal of aid** by reinforcing erroneous
**perceptions** that **America is on its own**]{.mark}]{.underline} when
it comes to fighting hunger, disease, and natural disasters. [[Placing
aid within a **multilateral context**]{.mark}, by contrast,
**[highlights the contributions of other states]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
A 2010 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey found that only 8%
supported the view that the United States should continue to serve as
the pre-eminent leader in responding to international problems. On the
other hand, only 19% felt that the United States should withdraw from
efforts to solve most international problems. Instead, a large
majority---71%---adopted the view that the United States should do its
share in cooperation with other countries.

More generally, [[**public support** for **multilat**]{.mark}**eral
engagement** [**rises** when the]{.mark} domestic [audience is primed
through]{.mark} exposure to **[cooperative
frames]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Framing involves the use of metaphors,
analogies, and symbols that serve to cue up desired associations among
audience members with respect to a given issue. Research conducted by
the Aspen Institute has found that, in comparisons with a control group,
respondent attitudes toward multilateral engagement abroad shifted in a
positive direction when previously exposed to statements stressing
interdependence, partnership, and shared norms among states and
societies. This research also suggested that policymakers must convince
members of the public that global problems are not intractable but
instead amenable to feasible solutions.

[Despite recent survey results pointing to declining support for
international engagement, the challenge for policymakers who seek to
overcome domestic obstacles to international engagement is less to
expand the breadth of public support for such initiatives than to deepen
the salience of multilateralism among members of the
public]{.underline}. [Passive and [**shallow majorities** in
favor]{.mark} of international cooperation [**do little to counter** the
influence of **mobilized interests who oppose multilat**]{.mark}**eral
engagement** or to overcome misperceptions among politicians who
mistakenly read the public as unilateralist. [A **president** **seeking
domestic support for a multilat**]{.mark}**eral [agenda]{.mark}** in US
foreign policy **[must]{.mark}** therefore **craft a compelling
narrative** that serves to awaken and **[mobilize]{.mark}** the latent
**[public support]{.mark}** that has to date remained dormant and
underutilized]{.underline}.

### T/N -- Miscalc

#### Counterplan's [signal]{.underline} of [subregional fragmentation]{.underline} causes [miscalc]{.underline} -- [escalates]{.underline} to global war

[[**No matter** how]{.mark} one might [assess **sub-regional force
balances**]{.mark}, the [**assumption** that]{.mark} an [aggression
against]{.mark} a **[NATO]{.mark}** ally [could be **limited to** a
**sub-regional war** seems **flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nevertheless, a narrow focus on sub-regional Russian geographical
advantages]{.underline} as to quick movements of land forces [has been
shaping the western discussion on military response
options]{.underline}.

[But launching a deliberate major aggression against an alliance that
disposes at superior conventional forces and positive security
guarantees by nuclear powers [would entail **incalculable risks**
of]{.mark} a **[global war]{.mark}**. This is not a plausible
scenario]{.underline}.

**[[This is why]{.underline}]{.mark}** the German government and
[western European allies during the Warsaw **[NATO]{.mark}**
Summit]{.underline}7 [in]{.underline} July [2016
[insisted]{.mark}]{.underline} that the purpose of an enhanced forward
presence is a limited one: It aims [[at **sending a strategic signal**
that the **alliance cannot be divided** **rather than**]{.mark} trying
to [engage in an **arms race** to win **sub-regional military
superiority**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, they rejected requests
to station several heavy brigades and to build-up new military
frontlines in contradiction to the restraint commitment enshrined in the
NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997.8

[The true core of the issue is that changing force postures and military
doctrines, forward deployment of new units and the **[increase of
military activities]{.mark}** such as large scale manoeuvres, snap
exercises [without prior notification]{.mark} and near border
reconnaissance flights [are]{.mark} a matter [of great concern]{.mark},
especially if accompanied by **[dangerous brinkmanship]{.mark}** which
[can **spin out of control**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This concern is all
the more relevant since a sense of a new confrontation is dominating
political discourses in East and West and the narratives on the root
causes of conflict have developed in opposite and incompatible
directions.

#### It's the nightmare scenario

The final scenario envisages [a more organic and fluid European security
system]{.underline}, evolving without the conscious architectural design
of the first three models, and [taking shape through a process of mutual
give and take]{.underline}. It is a model of a Europe of independent
nation-states, defending their national interests but [cooperating
together for mutual benefit, **[without]{.mark}** attempting to create a
[**hierarchical security architecture** or **overarching multilateral
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this scenario, European security
would [involve shifting patterns of **[bilat]{.mark}eral**,
**minilateral** and multilateral cooperation, with ad hoc groupings
('coalitions of the willing') forming to deal with specific problems,
and a '**variable geometry**' of **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation** developing across the continent. This [is a
vision]{.mark} of Europe [that **lacks many**]{.mark} **committed
[advocates]{.mark}**; indeed, it is one which is [**widely viewed** as
the **nightmare scenario**, involving]{.mark} a
'**[renationalisation]{.mark}**' [of security policy]{.mark},
**[multipolar instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and a situation in
which -- in Thucydides words -- the strong do what they will, and the
weak do what they must.
