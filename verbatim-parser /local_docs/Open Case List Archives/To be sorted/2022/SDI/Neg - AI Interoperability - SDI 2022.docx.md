### 1NC --- AI Leadership Advantage

#### 1. Allied governments will win the tech race---they have the culture of innovation on their side.

Emerging Security Challenges Division, "Building a resilient innovation
pipeline for the Alliance," Retrieved 6/12/2022 from

But before we get to commercialisation, we need to create the direction
of what it is we wish to see commercialised. **[[Technological
disruptive innovation does not just happen. It starts with a
mission-oriented vision, where]{.underline}]{.mark}** measuring risk is
impossible and **[only [uncertainty reigns. It requires bold
moves]{.mark}]{.underline}** that will signpost the future; **[[the
confidence to place big bets on tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology
**[[not yet invented; and an ability to pick winners -- all of which
must be underpinned by persistent engagement,]{.mark} encouragement and
enlightenment. [Since the end of the Second World War, only one entity
has taken-on such uncertainty: Allied governments]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(see image below).

#### 2. AI technologies are not key to military power.

Michael C. **Horowitz, 2018** (Professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, "Artificial Intelligence, International Competition, and
the Balance of Power," Retrieved 6/11/2022 from
<https://tnsr.org/2018/05/artificial-intelligence-international-competition-and-the-balance-of-power/>)

Emerging technologies primarily shape the balance of power through
military and economic means.37 Technologies can directly influence
countries' abilities to fight and win wars. They can also indirectly
affect the balance of power by impacting a country's economic power.
After all, countries cannot maintain military superiority over the
medium to long term without an underlying economic basis for that
power.38 Recall the decline of the Ottoman Empire or Imperial China.
However, **[[it is not yet clear how the invention of specific AI
applications will translate into military power. Despite continuing
investment, efforts to integrate AI technologies into militaries have
been limited]{.underline}]{.mark}**.39 Project Maven is the first
activity of an "Algorithmic Warfare" initiative in the U.S. military
designed to harness the potential of AI and translate it into usable
military capabilities. Still, many investments in the United States and
elsewhere are in early stages. As Missy L. Cummings writes:
**[[Autonomous]{.underline}]{.mark}** ground
**[[vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as tanks and transport vehicles
**[[are in development worldwide]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as are
autonomous underwater vehicles. **[[In almost all
cases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[the agencies developing these
technologies are struggling to make the leap from development
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** operational
**[[implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.40

#### 3. Chinese leadership allows for world peace and the solution to a host of international problems.

**Global Times, 2021** CHINA WINS INCREASING SUPPORT AT UN DURING 50
YRS, OPPOSING UNILATERALISM, PROTECTIONISM AND HEGEMONY. Oct. 22, 2021.

**[[Over the past 50 years, China has firmly upheld world peace and
security. China has been committed to]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
objective and just position, to **[[resolving differences through
dialogue and consultations,]{.mark}]{.underline}** and to the principle
of non-interference in each others\' internal affairs. **[[China firmly
opposes the willful threat or use of force in international
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the paper said. China has also made
vigorous efforts to promote global development, and has met the poverty
eradication target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10
years ahead of schedule. **[[China has firmly upheld the international
order underpinned by international law]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and fully
supported the UN in playing a central role in international affairs. On
October 25, 1971, the 26th UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758
with an overwhelming majority of votes, restoring all the lawful rights
of the People\'s Republic of China at the UN and recognizing the
representatives of its government as the only legitimate representative
of China at the UN. China will organize a conference marking the 50th
anniversary of the restoration of its lawful seat in the UN in Beijing
on Monday, and President Xi Jinping will attend the conference and
deliver important remarks. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
foreign diplomats and representatives of international organizations
will also attend the conference on site or via video, Zhao Lijian,
spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at Friday\'s media
briefing. The past 50 years were the golden 50 years for close
coordination and cooperation between China and the UN which has not only
smoothened relations between China and other countries, but also
enhanced the authority of the UN which has been undermined by the US\'
Cold War mentality and hegemony, analysts said. **[[Chinese analysts
said that China\'s international reputation as well as the UN\'s
reputation in resolving international disputes were enhanced with
deepened cooperation between China and UN, and China\'s concept of
seeking cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, upholding multilateralism
and acting as a responsible major country **[[has enabled the UN to take
more initiative and show more inclusiveness in dealing with global
issues of security, climate change, and health.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### 4. LIO doesn't cause peace, other factors explain peace, not LIO.

Charles L. **Glaser, 4/1**/20**19** (professor of political science and
international affairs and director of the Elliott School\'s Institute
for Security and Conflict, "A Flawed Framework: Why the Liberal
International Order Concept Is Misguided,"

However, **[[while the causes of Cold War peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and the end of the Cold War **[[have]{.underline}]{.mark}** fueled much
debate and **[[generated many competing explanations, the LIO is rarely
among them]{.underline}]{.mark}**.80 **[[Effective balancing by U.S.
alliances, deterrence supported by nuclear weapons, and bipolarity are
much more prominent explanations for the Cold War
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The economic effectiveness of capitalism
relative to Soviet communism, the overwhelming and increasing power
advantage that the West enjoyed by the 1980s, and the spread of ideas
about security requirements and cooperation are commonly identified as
contributing to the end of the Cold War.81 **[[If these factors are key,
then there is little left for the LIO concept to
explain]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### 5. Nationalism prevents China from playing a leading role in the international world order.

James Andrew **Lewis**, 11/30/20**18** (Senior Vice President and
Director, Strategic Technologies Program, "Technological Competition and
China," [https://www.csis.org/
analysis/technological-competition-and-china](https://www.csis.org/%20analysis/technological-competition-and-china),
Retrieved 8/11/2021)

U.S. difficulties in governance and in developing a new model for
innovation do not automatically cede leadership to China. **[[Inherent
tensions in Chinese policy make China's desire for a leading role in the
international order more complicated and
problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China is in the Western world, but
not of it, meaning its leaders reject the values and beliefs that
underpin global institutions when these are contrary to the ruling
party's interests. There are, of course, tensions within Chinese
politics over national versus international practice, but the ruling
party's political circumstances incline it toward a nationalism as a
source of legitimacy. **[[This emphasis on nationalism creates
complications if China seeks to play a guiding role on the world
stage]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

#### 6. US & China won't go to nuclear conflict.

James Andrew **Lewis**, 11/30/20**18** (Senior Vice President and
Director, Strategic Technologies Program, "Technological Competition and
China," [https://www.csis.org/
analysis/technological-competition-and-china](https://www.csis.org/%20analysis/technological-competition-and-china),
Retrieved 8/11/2021)

One touchstone for understanding this contest is the ruling party's
strong desire to avoid the fate of Gorbachev and the Soviet Union. The
Chinese diagnosis of the Soviet collapse blames the problems created by
corruption, exposure to damaging Western ideas, and by Soviet efforts to
match U.S. military spending. However, this diagnosis begs the question
of whether the Soviet system was fundamentally flawed and unsustainable
and whether any system derived from the Soviet model, no matter how
attenuated the connection, can be sustained. We can dismiss the idea of
a "Thucydides trap." It is not China's rise that creates tensions, but
the means China has used to achieve this rise. Putting asides its
idiosyncratic interpretation of the Peloponnesian War, **[[both China
and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[will seek to avoid]{.underline}]{.mark}** damaging and risky
**[[military conflict. The advent of nuclear weapons imposes a degree of
caution on even the most overconfident leaders when it comes to military
adventures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Clashes at the margins similar to
border fights with India and Russia might occur, but even low-level
clashes hold considerable risk of escalation that will restrain both
countries. Conflict and competition today will take new forms, and these
new forms of conflict are redefining U.S.-China relations.

### Extensions #1: Allies Will Win the Tech Race Extensions

#### Allied open democracies are better for innovation than other forms of government.

Rob **Murray,** 9/1/20**20** (head of the Innovation Unit in NATO's
Emerging Security Challenges Division, "Building a resilient innovation
pipeline for the Alliance," Retrieved 6/12/2022 from

The reason is simple: **[[the competition and creativity generated by
start-ups is good for the Allied defence ecosystem. Allied open
democracies and open educational models bring about levels of creativity
which other forms of government are unable to do. This maximises
disruptive innovation efforts and]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as such,

#### NATO's innovation fund solves the AFF.

Vivienne **Machi,** 11/3/20**21** (reporter based in Stuttgart, Germany,
"NATO ups the ante on disruptive tech, artificial intelligence,"

STUTTGART, Germany --- **[[NATO has officially kicked off two new

were formally agreed upon during NATO's meeting of defense ministers
last month]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Brussels, said Secretary-General
Jens Stoltenberg. Allies signed the agreement to establish the NATO
Innovation Fund and launch DIANA on Oct. 22, the final day of the
two-day conference, Stoltenberg said in a media briefing that day. He
expects the fund to invest €1 billion (U.S. \$1.16 billion) into
companies and academic partners working on emerging and disruptive
technologies. "New technologies are reshaping our world and our
security," Stoltenberg said. "**[[NATO's new innovation fund will ensure
allies do not miss out on the latest tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology
**[[and capabilities that will be critical to our
security."]{.mark}]{.underline}** "We need to ensure that allies are
able to operate the different technologies seamlessly, between their
forces, and with each other," he added. Seventeen allied countries
agreed to help launch the innovation fund. They include: Belgium, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Slovakia, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom.

#### The US leads in the AI tech race now.

Neil **Savage, 12/9**/20**20** (Neil Savage is a science writer based in
Lowell, Massachusetts, "The race to the top among the world's leaders in
artificial intelligence,"
<https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03409-8>, Retrieved
8/20/2021)

**[[As nations vie for leadership, AI research output is increasing
rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to our analysis of journal
publications and conference papers tracked by the Dimensions database,
the global output for AI research grew from just over 52,000 globally in
2000 to roughly 403,000 in 2019, representing an increase of more than
600%. Now the most popular specialization among computer-science PhD
students in North America, AI is set to continue its steep, upward
trajectory. Rising revenues **[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[has historically been the leader
in AI-related research output]{.underline}]{.mark}**, having accumulated
the highest number of publications over the past two decades. But China
has ramped up its output in recent years. In each year from 2016 to
2019, China produced more AI-related papers than any other nation,
according to Dimensions. Over this period, China's output of AI-related
research increased by just over 120%, whereas output in the US increased
by almost 70%. In 2019, China published 102,161 AI-related papers, and
the US published 74,386. India, which came in third, published 23,398.
Publication numbers aren't the whole story, says Jeffrey Ding, a PhD
student at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford,
UK, who studies China's AI strategy. In the AI Index Report, which uses
citation numbers to measure the quality of AI papers, papers from China
were cited about 20% less than the world average in 2019, whereas papers
from the US were cited about 40% more than average. "Just pumping out
raw numbers of papers that don't have a lasting impact isn't really
useful," says Ding. "It's more important to keep up with the technology
frontier." A Nature Index analysis for this supplement looked at the
number of AI-related articles published in the 82 high-quality
natural-science journals tracked by the index, which primarily concern
the application of AI to research in the broad fields of chemistry, the
physical sciences, life sciences, and Earth and environmental sciences.
Between 2015 and 2019, the US was the leader, with the UK, Germany and
China in second, third and fourth place, respectively. But China has
increased its output in journals tracked by the index. Although it was
the fourth-most prolific country in the index in 2015, with roughly half
as many AI-related papers as Germany, China crept up over the next three
years, then leapt to second place in 2019, showing an increase of 340%.
The US, UK and Germany slightly more than doubled their output over the
same period. **[[For the near future]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Ding says,
**[[the US is likely to remain the world leader in AI. "Though China has
some exceptional universities,]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as Tsinghua
University, **[[the US dominates in]{.underline}]{.mark}** terms of
maybe **[[the top 20 universities doing AI
research]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that is reflected in the quality of
the papers. **[[It's very unlikely that China will become the singular
innovation centre by 2030."]{.mark}]{.underline}** Many countries see AI
as providing a competitive edge, not only economically, but militarily,
says Husain. He likens **[[the competition in AI to the Space Race of
the mid-twentieth century,]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which the US and
the Soviet Union vied to be the first to achieve milestones in space
travel. "**[[The Space Race yielded contributions that differentiated
the American tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological **[[ecosystem from all
others for decades to come,]{.underline}]{.mark}**" says Husain. "If a
country invests heavily in this area, it will yield technologies that
will form the pillar of defence capability and economic differentiation
for the rest of the century." **[[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies
**[[that can be developed based on AI will indeed have both economic and
military benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}**, says Daniel Araya, a policy
analyst at the Center for International Governance Innovation, a think
tank in Ontario, Canada. "We're talking new weapons, data-driven
innovation for industry and automation, and redesigning how our society
works from the ground up." Husain points to Germany, which maintains a
strong economy that relies on exports of products such as machine parts
and automobiles, even though lower-income countries can provide low-wage
labour for manufacturing. Germany has been able to compete by using
automation to keep manufacturing costs down, while keeping quality and
productivity high. AI could reinforce this advantage by powering the
next generation of automation technologies. "Anybody that has mastery
over this technology and is investing in implementing it retains an
economic lead," says Husain. Institutions in Germany, such as the
Fraunhofer Society, Europe's largest application-oriented research
organization, have been emphasizing Industry 4.0, a national strategic
initiative from the German government to introduce more digital
innovation and advanced robotics into manufacturing and supply-chain
management. In China, the ability offered by AI systems to monitor
public spaces and scan Internet traffic in an effort to glean user
intentions may provide the state with improved tools for social control,
enhancing its capability for monitoring the population or censoring
information. Even in countries that don't officially track their
populaces, facial-recognition technology, such as that produced by New
York-based company, Clearview AI, is being used by law enforcement to
identify suspects. The technology has been met with deep concern by some
researchers, who say that biases built into its algorithms could result
in ethical and human rights abuses. Amid the controversy that surrounds
certain applications of AI, some groups are highlighting the good it can
do. In 2019, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial
Intelligence, a scientific society in Menlo Park, California, launched
its Artificial Intelligence for the Benefit of Humanity award, a
US\$1-million prize funded by Squirrel AI, an education technology
company based in Shanghai, China. The inaugural winner, Regina Barzilay
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, received the award in September 2020 for developing a
machine-learning algorithm that can examine mammograms and predict which
women are at a higher risk of breast cancer. Barzilay has also developed
a pattern-recognition algorithm that predicts which molecules might make
good candidates for new medications. Publishing in the journal Cell,
Barzilay and her colleagues described how their system identified a
molecule, dubbed halicin, as a potentially potent new antibiotic (J. M.
Stokes et al. Cell 180, 688--702; 2020). When the molecule was
synthesized and tested, it was found to kill antibiotic-resistant
bacteria. Barzilay continues to work on halicin and hopes to progress it
to clinical trials. Money to spend With an eye to the potential benefits
of AI-based technologies, the US National Science Foundation (NSF)
announced in August 2020 that it is establishing five new institutes
focused on different topics, each led by a different university, and
each to receive \$20 million over five years. One, led by the University
of Oklahoma in Norman, will use AI systems to improve climate
forecasting accuracy. Another, at the University of Texas at Austin,
will focus on the next generation of machine-learning algorithms. A
third, led by the University of Colorado Boulder, will apply AI
technologies to teaching and learning. The fourth, headed by the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will explore the discovery
and synthesis of new materials and drugs using AI systems. And a fifth,
led by MIT, will investigate how AI can improve research in fundamental
physics. The NSF has put out a call for proposals for eight more AI
institutes, which it plans to announce next year. "We have a long
history of supporting basic research in artificial intelligence," says
Erwin Gianchandani, the NSF's deputy assistant director for computer and
information science and engineering. In addition, the US Department of
Agriculture's National Institute of Food and Agriculture has committed
to funding another two institutes each with \$20 million over five years
to apply AI to questions of crop yield, pest resistance and food
distribution. Access to massive data sets on which to train
machine-learning systems is one advantage that both the US and China
have, says Araya. Europe, on the other hand, has stringent data laws,
which protect people's privacy, but limit its resources for training AI
algorithms. "So, it seems unlikely that Europe will produce very
sophisticated AI as a consequence," he says. "China is at the opposite
end of the spectrum, where it has few data protections, and huge access
to varied and diverse pieces of data." The NSF doesn't make decisions
based on global competition, says Rebecca Keiser, the organization's
first chief of research security strategy and policy. Her position is
designed to safeguard the security of federally funded research, while
promoting international collaborations. "We think of it more in terms of
the impact that our funding is going to have, rather than from a nation
perspective. The fact that it also contributes to US global science
leadership is fabulous," says Keiser. As for competing against China in
AI, she says, "We don't really know how much, and where, they're
investing, so it's hard to compete against that." With funding from
other major US agencies, including the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency and National Institutes of Health, **[[the US government
expected to spend almost \$5 billion on unclassified AI research in
2020]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Other countries are investing, too. The
UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council gave out nearly
£160 million (US\$212 million) in 2020. The European Commission, which
has been supporting research through its Horizon 2020 programme, says
public and private investment in AI should reach €20 billion (US\$23
billion) across Europe by the end of 2020. Even with other countries
placing emphasis on AI research, including Israel, Japan, Singapore and
Australia, the race comes down to China versus the US, Araya says. The
refinement of AI systems is driven not simply by academic questions, but
by applying the systems' intelligence to practical problems. Countries
will probably make advances by using AI in areas where they already have
expertise, says Ding, such as automation in Germany or robotics in
Japan. Having so many researchers around the globe tackling all aspects
of AI should advance the whole field, says Keiser. "It's always good to
have a bit of healthy competition."

[The U.S. long has been the global technology

much about the Chinese government's [ambition to
dominate](https://www.csis.org/analysis/made-china-2025) high-tech
industries such as 5G telecommunications, autonomous vehicles,
blockchain, and semiconductor chips.  In this light, as a horizontal
technology that can be applied across all sectors, artificial
intelligence (AI) has become a strategic priority and the [Chinese
focus](https://www.afr.com/technology/is-china-winning-the-ai-race-20200805-p55imu) on
superiority in this field is touted as something about which the U.S.

availability of large amounts of data is at the heart of AI
success]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is tempting to think that
less-democratic regimes that amass huge amounts of data about their
citizens and have scant regard for privacy can develop better AI systems
using that data. However, all other things being equal, better and
higher quality AI systems emerge from countries with strong data privacy
and data protection regulations because AI systems must undergo greater
scrutiny during their development and deployment. [An
example](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/innovation-spotlight-providing-adverse-action-notices-when-using-ai-ml-models/) of
this can be seen in the United States regarding fair lending practices
and consumer protection from credit bureaus. Further, the market for AI
is global, and such high-quality AI systems find buyers in other
countries as well. Around the globe, Big Tech's rising power has
resulted in calls for more oversight. In a drastic move that stunned the
industry and analysts alike, **[[the Chinese government [recently

In effect, China is vacating entire swaths of digital and creative
industries, arenas that serve as training grounds and talent factories
for other industries. **[[This more restrictive approach may not bode
well for China's AI industry in the long term.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
China may find itself constrained on the extent of automation and AI in
its manufacturing sector --- labor-intensive manufacturing remains
China's main strength, and a high degree of automation can result in job
losses, labor unrest, and instability. Meanwhile, there is bipartisan
support for AI in the United States. Former [President

Act](https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt617/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf#page=1215) of
2020 signaled a sense of urgency and suggested that several federal

to set the "rules of the road" for proper use of AI. [[**This will

#### AI is not key to military innovations.

It is important to distinguish these potential technological innovations
from military innovations. While military innovations are often linked
to changes in technology,41 it is not always the case. Military
innovations are significant changes in organizational behavior and ways
that a military fights that are designed to increase its ability to
effectively translate capabilities into power.42 The use of aircraft
carriers as mobile airfields by the United States and Japan is a
prototypical example. **[[While AI could potentially enable a number of
military innovations, it is not a military innovation itself, and no
applications of AI have been used in ways that would count as a military
innovation at this point]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

plates that underpin it are shifting, and little can be done to repair
and rescue it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, that order was destined to
fail from the start, as it contained the seeds of its own destruction.
The fall of the liberal international order horrifies the Western elites
who built it and who have benefited from it in many ways.1 These elites
fervently believe that this order was and remains an important force for
promoting peace and prosperity around the globe. Many of them blame
President Donald Trump for its demise. After all, he expressed contempt
for the liberal order when campaigning for president in 2016; and since
taking office, he has pur-sued policies that seem designed to tear it
down. **[[It would be a mistake]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[to

**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rder **[[is in trouble solely because of

funda¬mental problems are at play]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which account
for why Trump has been able to successfully challenge an order that
enjoys almost universal support among the foreign policy elites in the
West. The aim of this article is to determine why **[[the liberal world
order is in big trouble]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to identify the kind
of inter¬national order that will replace it. I offer three main sets of
arguments. First, because states in the modern world are deeply
interconnected in a variety of ways, orders are essential for
facilitating efficient and timely interactions. There are different
kinds of inter-national orders, and which type emerges depends primarily
on the global dis-tribution of power. But when the system is unipolar,
the political ideology of the sole pole also matters. Liberal
international orders can arise only in unipo-lar systems where the
leading state is a liberal democracy. Second, the United States has led
two different orders since World War II. The Cold War order, which is
sometimes mistakenly referred to as a "liberal international order," was
neither liberal nor international. It was a bounded or-der that was
limited mainly to the West and was realist in all its key dimen-sions.
It had certain features that were also consistent with a liberal order,
but those attributes were based on realist logic. The U.S.-led
post--Cold War order, on the other hand, is liberal and international,
and thus differs in fundamental ways from the bounded order the United
States dominated during the Cold War. Third, **[[the post--Cold War
l]{.underline}]{.mark}**iberal **[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**nternational
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**rder **[[was doomed to col-lapse, because
the key policies on which it rested are deeply flawed. Spreading liberal
democracy around the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[which is of
paramount importance for building such an order, not only is extremely
difficult, but often poisons rela¬tions with other
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** and sometimes leads to disastrous wars.
National¬ism within the target state is the main obstacle to the
promotion of democracy, but balance of power politics also function as
an important blocking force. Furthermore, **[[the liberal order's
tendency to privilege international in-stitutions over domestic
considerations,]{.underline}]{.mark}** as well as its deep commitment to
po-rous, if not open borders, **[[has had toxic political effects inside
the leading liberal states themselves, including the U.S. unipole. Those
policies clash with nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** over key issues
such as sovereignty and national identity. **[[Be¬cause nationalism is

barriers to global trade and investment, resulted in lost jobs,
declining wages, and rising income inequality throughout the liberal
world. It also made the international finan¬cial system less stable,

political problems, **[[further eroding support for the liberal

### East China Sea Defense

#### No Senkakus conflict---four reasons:

M. Taylor **Fravel**, 8/19/20**19** (Arthur and Ruth Sloan Professor of
Political Science and Director of the MIT Security Studies Program at
MIT), "Explaining Stability in the Senkaku (Diaoyu) Islands Dispute,"
<https://www.jcie.org/researchpdfs/Triangle/7_fravel.pdf>

The dynamics of the Senkaku Islands dispute since the 1970s present a
puzzle. At first glance, one might expect that this dispute should be
fraught with tension and even violence. Territorial disputes often serve
as proxies for broader conflicts of interests, especially between states
that might be characterized as enduring or strategic rivals, such as
China and Japan.21 Although the China-Japan economic relationship has
continued to deepen since the end of the Cold War, political relations
have oscillated between pe¬riods of heightened friction and relative
calm.22 At the same time, both sides see the islands as important real
estate, endowed with strategic significance and economic value,
characteristics that increase a state's willingness to use force in a
territorial dispute.23 China has also used force in other disputes over
offshore islands, most notably over the Paracels in 1974 and the
Spratlys in 1988 and 1994.24 Finally, given the history of Japan's
occupation of parts of China, one might expect territorial issues to be
especially prominent as a source of friction between the two countries
and one that leaders might manipulate to mobilize society, perhaps for
diversionary ends.25 Since 1949, however, China has never used force
against Japan over the Senkaku Islands, although it did display its
potential to use force once, in 1978, during the peace treaty
negotiations.26 The fact that armed conflict over the islands has been
avoided is a major accomplishment and one that deserves detailed
examination because, in many ways, it is unexpected. The analysis below
focuses mostly on China for several reasons. First---unlike
Japan---China, as noted above, has used force in its other territorial
disputes since the end of World War II and in half of its offshore
island disputes. Second, as the "challenger" in the Senkakus dispute,
force remains a vi¬able option for China to regain sovereignty of the
islands to improve its otherwise weak position or to compel concessions
from Japan. By contrast, because Japan already occupies and controls the
islands, force is not necessary to improve its claim and would only be
used to deter or prevent a Chinese attack. Nevertheless, even as the
"defender," the use of force for Japan remains a viable option under
certain conditions. In par¬ticular, because Japan already controls the
islands, it may be more willing to use force to arrest or reverse
decline in its position in the dispute in the face of increasing Chinese
provocations, such as the dispatch of mainland survey ships within the
territorial waters of the islands in December 2008. Indeed, reflecting
concerns about China's growing military power and naval activities in
the East China Sea, Japan's military drafted a contingency plan in
November 2004 "to defend the southern remote islands off Kyushu and
Okinawa from possible invasion."27 Explaining state inaction or the
absence of a particular outcome such as the use of force presents a
challenge for social scientists. One of the core problems is that
patterns of inaction or nonevents are likely to be overdetermined; that
is, they are consistent with multiple if not overlap-ping variables and
explanations. As a particular behavior is not observed, it is more
challenging to identify those factors that vary with inaction as opposed
to using force or offering to compromise. Nevertheless, **[[four reasons
help explain the absence of violent conflict in the Senkaku
dis¬pute]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1972: **[[deterrence, de facto
control, regional rivalry, and active dispute
management]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Deterrence **[[The first and most
important reason is deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Put simply,
**[[China has lacked the military means to execute a limited-aims
operation to seize and defend the islands from any
counterattack]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although China did clash with
South Vietnam in 1974 and Vietnam in 1988 in other offshore island
conflicts, those countries possessed very limited naval power and China
was able to achieve victory after short clashes. By contrast, **[[Japan
possesses the strongest]{.underline}]{.mark}** and most professional
**[[navy of any East Asian country]{.underline}]{.mark}**.28 **[[More
importantly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[the US alliance with
Japan has]{.underline}]{.mark}** arguably **[[deterred China from taking
any armed action]{.underline}]{.mark}** over the islands. Given Article
V, use of force over the Senkakus would run the very real risk of
conflict with the United States---conflict that China would prefer to
avoid. As discussed below in the section on dispute management,
**[[public US statements]{.underline}]{.mark}** regard¬ing its
commitment under the treaty that were issued during moments of tension
in the dispute **[[represent subtle deterrent
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[De Facto Control]{.mark} [The
continuous occupation of the disputed islands by Japan during the period
when their sovereignty has been contested is a second reason for the
absence of escalation. Continuous occupation]{.mark}]{.underline}** by
one state in a territo¬rial dispute significantly **[[increases the cost
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the other side (in this case **[[China) of
using force, as the international community would view any use]{.mark}
[of force as a clear sign of revisionist
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Occupation by one side, in other words,
reinforces the status quo bias of the international system. By contrast,
although China did use force in the Paracels and the Spratlys, it seized
islands and coral reefs that were claimed but not occupied by other
states and vacant real estate (with the exception of Pattle Island in
the Paracels). In disputes on its land border, China has not seized
large amounts of disputed territory through the use of force, especially
when contested territory has been occupied by other states. In its 1962
war with India over disputed areas along its southwestern frontier, for
example, China won a military victory but then withdrew to the line of
actual control that had existed prior to the outbreak of hostilities.29
**[[Regional Rivalry]{.mark} [A third reason for the absence of
escalation stems from the continuing competition between China and Japan
for diplomatic influence within East Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For
different reasons, **[[both countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely
**[[want to maintain reputations as]{.underline}]{.mark}** constructive
and **[[benign powers]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region.
**[[Escalation or use of force over the Senkakus would tarnish that
reputation. In particular, China's current diplomatic strategy revolves
around]{.underline}]{.mark}** the notions of "**[[peaceful
development]{.underline}]{.mark}**" and "reassurance."30
**[[Belligerence over territory would send a
signal]{.underline}]{.mark}** to most states in the region
**[[that]{.mark}]{.underline}** a more powerful **[[China
might]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[be]{.underline}]{.mark}** more
**[[aggressive]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus increasing suspicion and
uncertainty about China's long-term intentions. **[[Active Dispute
Management]{.mark}]{.underline}** A fourth and underexamined reason is
how **[[both sides have sought to manage the dispute to
avoid]{.underline}]{.mark}** unwanted spirals of hostility and
**[[tension that might culminate in the use of
force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Several aspects of dispute management must
be stressed, as they have received little attention in analyses of the
Senkaku dispute or, for that matter, in the international relations
scholar¬ship on territorial disputes. Even if China has been deterred by
US power, Japanese control of the disputed islands, or potential
reputational costs, the management of tensions in this dispute is also
important. **[[All three countries have played a role in the successful
management of the dispute]{.underline}]{.mark}**, where success is
defined as the absence of conflict. Limited Access **[[Perhaps the
leading source of friction in the dispute over the past two decades has
been efforts by citizen activists to land on the
islands]{.underline}]{.mark}** to demonstrate their countries'
sovereignty claims. These ac-tions then compel governments to get
involved in the dispute, increasing the potential for armed conflict. In
the 1990s, several crises over the is¬lands occurred when activist
groups from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan journeyed to the disputed
rocks. Japanese activists, most notably from the Japan Youth League,
frequently visited the islands in the 1990s to main¬tain a lighthouse on
Uotsuri (Diaoyu) Island that was first built in 1978.31 In response,
individuals from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mainland China sought to land on
the Senkakus to support China's claims. In 1996, a Hong Kong citizen,
David Chan, drowned as he attempted to land and plant a flag on one of
the islands.32 A number of other unsuccessful attempts have also been
made by groups supporting China's claim, but in 2004, activists from
Mainland China successfully landed on the islands. As a private citizen
owns three of the five main islands, the Japanese government was unable
(or perhaps just unwilling) to prevent its own citi¬zens from making
symbolic visits and increasing the potential for conflict in the
dispute. Since 2002, however, **[[the Japanese government has taken a
number of steps to]{.mark}]{.underline}** enhance its control over the
islands and **[[limit access by Japanese citizens, thereby reducing
incentives for Chinese patriotic groups to land on the
islands]{.underline}]{.mark}** in response. First, in April 2002,
**[[the Japanese government entered into a lease for the three islands
remaining outside of government control]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
placed all of the disputed features under the direct control of the
Japanese government, and because the government became a leaseholder, it
could both prevent the sale of the islands to activists who might seek
to make use of them for political goals and block activists from all
sides from landing on the islands.33 Second, just one month after the
first successful landing on the islands by Mainland Chinese activists in
March 2004, **[[the Japanese government decided to station two Coast
Guard vessels near the islands in order to prevent individuals from
landing on them]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the future.34 Third, in
February 2005, Japan further consolidated control over the islands when
it announced that it had assumed control of the lighthouse on Uotsuri
that had been built and maintained by the Japan Youth League. These
actions elicited sharp protests in Beijing and Taipei as they were
viewed as unilateral assertions of sovereignty over contested territory
and consolidation of Japanese control. Nevertheless, they lowered
tensions by removing perhaps the greatest irritant in the dispute, the
actions of activ¬ist citizens. In the past, the rationale for these
visits by Japanese activists was the need to maintain the lighthouses
and replace their solar-powered batteries. Indeed, according to public
news sources, no Japanese activists have successfully landed on the
islands since 2003.35 Although this has not prevented subsequent
attempts by Chinese and Taiwanese patriotic groups to land on the
islands, the Japanese government has been able to intercept these ships
rapidly through the deployment of Coast Guard ves¬sels in surrounding
waters. **[[Similarly, the Chinese government has sought to restrict the
activities of its own citizens around the
islands]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For most of the 1990s, only activists
from Hong Kong and Taiwan, not Mainland China, sought to land on the
islands in protest. In 2003, however, a mainland-based group, the China
Federation for Defending the Diaoyu Islands, began preparations for a
voyage to the islands.36 After several reconnaissance trips, the
federation landed seven members on Uotsuri in March 2004.37 These
individuals were detained by the Japanese Coast Guard and deported to
China 48 hours later. Although it is not clear what the Chinese
government's policy toward such groups was before this landing, since
then it has sought to prevent any further landings or maritime
excursions to the islands by its citizens from Chinese ports. In July
2004, local officials in Fujian prevented members of the federation from
using Chinese fishing vessels for noncommercial purposes such as
traveling to the islands.38 And, following anti-Japan protests in April
2005, the government raided the federation's offices in Beijing in July
2005.39 In October 2007, four members of the federation who had entered
Japanese territorial waters in an attempt to land on the islands were
placed under house arrest when they returned to China.40 Avoidance of
Social Mobilization **[[A second aspect of dispute manage-ment that
deserves mention is that China has avoided mobilizing the public around
the dispute]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, despite its potential to
rally people around the flag and its role in past patriotic education
campaigns, the Senkakus dispute rarely appears in official newspapers.
As figure 1 demonstrates, the total number of articles that refer to
"Diaoyu Dao" (Senkaku Islands) in the title that have appeared in the
People's Liberation Army Daily (Jiefangjun bao) and the People's Daily
(Renmin ribao) since 1987 is low. In some years, no articles appeared at
all. Moreover, as shown in figure 2, the frequency of articles on the
Senkakus is roughly one-tenth of those published on the Spratlys and an
even smaller fraction of those concerning Taiwan. No clear trend exists
in the frequency or timing of articles on the Senkakus either. Analysis
of individual news reports suggests that the publication of articles is
caused by events linked to the dispute, especially activists' attempts
to land on the islands as well as Japan's own administrative actions.

#### Japan won't escalate---they'll just give up the Senkakus:

The People's Republic of China is turning up the heat around Japan's
Senkaku Islands, which the Chinese also claim and call the Diaoyu
Islands. It is challenging Japanese control and has warned Tokyo not to
complain the next time a host of Chinese fishing boats swarm the area
with Chinese Coast Guard and PLA Navy ships providing cover. And this is
likely to happen sooner rather than later. Japan's defense minister,
Taro Kono, said at an early August news conference that the Japanese
Self Defense Forces (JSDF) "will act firmly when necessary while joining
hands with the Japan Coast Guard." Kono declined to provide details,
saying: "We do not want to show our cards." Many Western observers have
long assumed that if backed into a corner Japan would fight -- despite
its reticence about things military. The prospect of losing territory to
the Chinese is presumably such a corner. Map: Wikimedia And despite
their shortcomings, the Self Defense Forces -- particularly the Maritime
Self Defense Force (MSDF) with its highly professional surface,
submarine and anti-submarine forces -- have the capability to bloody an
opponent's nose. But maybe the assumption is wrong. It could be that in

it shoot?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Or would it reckon that the cost of
military confrontation with China would far exceed the value of "some
rocks"? Far-fetched? Maybe not. **[[A recently retired JSDF
officer]{.underline}]{.mark}**, unprompted, recently confided his belief
that, even if the Senkaku Islands are invaded by China, **[[the
"Japanese government will not choose war."]{.mark}]{.underline}** He

matters."]{.mark}]{.underline}** I take his point. The Japanese would
sort of resist but my own guess is that, **[[if the only way to remove
the Chinese were to shoot, Japan wouldn't do it]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
This assumes the Chinese don't start shooting first. If China just comes
in and parks itself and even lands some people on the Senkakus and says,
"wuddyugonnadoaboutit?," the government of Japan just might do nothing
much. Activists shout slogans and wave the Chinese flag aboard a vessel

within 20 km of the main island in the chain before they were warned off
by a Japanese patrol boat. Chinese writing on a banner reads: \"Japan

that the Barack Obama administration allowed the PRC to take de facto
control of the South China Sea without putting up a fight -- or much of
an argument. And back then the US military still had the advantage over
the People's Liberation Army. There are of course Japanese -- including
factions in the ruling LDP and most members of the JSDF -- who think
Japan should defend all of the territories it claims. But there were
also Americans who thought Obama should forcefully defend US partners
and interests in East Asia in the 2010s. If letting go is what Japan's
leaders are thinking of doing, they can't exactly publicly declare it.
For one thing, Japan's public might be outraged -- if public opinion
polls, overwhelmingly negative toward China, are anything to go by. But
the citizenry doesn't always matter much in Japan and the government can
always simply say, after the fact, "Shoganai" -- it couldn't be helped.
One suspects that **[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** Inc **[[might be in
the "Senkakus aren't worth a war" camp. The Abe administration recently
allotted US\$2 billion to help Japanese companies move operations out of
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**. However, a Japanese friend whom I trust
told me the other day that Keidanren -- Japan's powerful business
federation -- is soon to issue a call for deeper economic ties with
China, while citing the PRC's post-Corona V-shaped recovery. Toyota,
Japan's leading company, is planning to go all-in on electric vehicle
production in China. There is a precedent for Japanese business
interests shaping defense policy. In 2012 anti-Japanese riots broke out
in China -- over the Senkakus -- and targeted a Japanese supermarket
chain's stores in the PRC. Around the same time, a prominent official
close to Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda convinced the leader to
cancel an upcoming amphibious exercise near Okinawa that I was directly
involved with after the Chinese complained. The official's family owned
the stores being targeted in China. No doubt this isn't unique to Japan.
Wall Street and the American business community have pressured
successive US administrations to accommodate the PRC for decades.

**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}** is not ignoring defense. But it almost
**[[seems to be going through the motions -- hoping China is somehow
frightened off or loses interest.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Defense
spending doesn't increase much. Recruitment is lackluster. The services
can't easily operate together. Japan's home-built stealth fighter is
scheduled for operations in 2035. And the government still can't figure
out missile defense -- or offense. Closer to the Senkakus, the GSDF is
fortifying several of Japan's southern islands and is in the process of
installing anti-ship missiles and anti-aircraft systems. The MSDF and
Japan Coast Guard diligently patrol near the Senkakus, and the Japan Air
Self Defense Force intercepts intruding PLA jets intruding into Japanese
airspace. However, these activities are disjointed and reactive rather
than part of a coherent defense scheme. And Japanese forces are
increasingly outmatched numbers-wise by Chinese ships and aircraft. Nor
is Senkaku defense a fully joint US-Japan effort, even though the need
has been obvious for years. If Japan does give up the Senkakus it may
avoid an immediate problem, from Tokyo's perspective -- but that won't
be the end of Chinese demands. Chinese PLA Navy soldiers on a naval
vessel in a file photo. Photo: Twitter And where would this leave the
Americans? US forces have operated on the assumption that each side will
do its part to defend Japan's territorial integrity. Cede the Senkakus
and it raises doubts about Japanese reliability and commitment, as well
as complicating US and Japanese military operations in the East China
Sea and beyond. And the Americans might reasonably ask: Are there other
parts of Japan you intend to give away? Or other instances where you
will stand down? If the new American ambassador ever does arrive in
Tokyo, his first order of business should be to ask the Japanese what
they have in mind for the Senkakus. After 60 years of alliance, one
would think both sides would know by now.

### Heg Defense

#### Hegemony doesn't cause peace---defense spending statistics prove.

Christopher J. **Fettweis, 2017** (Associate Professor of Political
Science at Tulane University), SECURITY STUDIES, vol. 26 2017.

How does one measure polarity? Power is traditionally considered to be
some combination of military and economic strength, but despite scores
of efforts, no widely accepted formula exists. Perhaps overall
**[[military spending might be thought of as a proxy for hard
power]{.mark} capabilities]{.underline}**; perhaps too the amount of
money the United States devotes to hard power is a reflection of the
strength of the unipole. **[[When compared to conflict levels, however,
there is no obvious correlation, and certainly not the kind of negative
relationship between US spending and conflict that many hegemonic
stability theorists would expect]{.mark}]{.underline}** to see.
**[[During the]{.underline}]{.mark}** 19**[[90s]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[cut back on defense by about 25 per-cent,]{.mark}]{.underline}**
spending \$100 billion less in real terms in 1998 that it did in 1990.68
To those believers in the neoconservative version of hegemonic
stability, this irre¬sponsible "peace dividend" endangered both national
and global security. "No serious analyst of American military
capabilities doubts that the defense bud¬get has been cut much too far
to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace," argued
Kristol and Kagan at the time.69 **[[The world grew dra¬matically more
peaceful while the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[cut its
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, and stayed just as peaceful
while spending rebounded after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. **[[The
incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the military
budget was cut under]{.underline}]{.mark}** President
[**[Clinton]{.underline}**,]{.mark} in other words, and kept declining
(though more slowly, since levels were already low) as the Bush
administration ramped it back up. Overall US military spending has
varied during the period of the New Peace from a low in constant dollars
of less than \$400 billion to a high of more than \$700 billion, but war
does not seem to have noticed. [**[The same nonrelationship exists
between other potential proxy measurements for hegemony and conflict:
there does not seem to be much connection between warfare and
fluctuations in US GDP, alliance com¬mitments, and forward military
presence]{.underline}**.]{.mark} There was very little fighting in
Europe when there were 300,000 US troops stationed there, for example,
and that has not changed as the number of Americans dwindled by 90
percent. Overall, **[there does not seem to be much correlation between
US actions and systemic stability.]{.underline}** Nothing the United
States actually does seems to matter to the New Peace.

#### Hegemony doesn't cause peace---areas of the world where the US has little influence are still peaceful.

Christopher J. **Fettweis, 2017** (Associate Professor of Political
Science at Tulane University), SECURITY STUDIES, vol. 26 2017.

**[[Even the most ardent supporters of the hegemonic-stability
explanation do not contend that US influence extends equally to all
corners of the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The United States has
concentrated its policing in what George Kennan used to call "strong
points," or the most important parts of the world: Western Europe, the
Pacific Rim, and Persian Gulf.64 By doing so, Washington may well have
contributed more to great power peace than the overall global decline in
warfare. If the former phenomenon contributed to the latter, by
essentially providing a behavioral model for weaker states to emulate,
then perhaps this lends some support to the hege¬monic-stability case.65
During the Cold War, the United States played referee to a few
intra-West squabbles, especially between Greece and Turkey, and provided
Hobbesian reassurance to Germany's nervous neighbors. Other, equally
plausible explanations exist for stability in the first world, including
the presence of a com¬mon enemy, democracy, economic interdependence,
general war aversion, etc. The looming presence of the leviathan is
certainly among these plausible explana-tions, but only inside the US
sphere of influence. Bipolarity was bad for the non¬aligned world, where
Soviet and Western intervention routinely exacerbated local conflicts.
Unipolarity has generally been much better, but whether or not this was
due to US action is again unclear. **[[Overall US interest in the
affairs of the Global South has dropped markedly since the end of the
Cold War, as has the level of violence in almost all regions]{.mark}.
There is less US intervention in the political and military affairs of
Latin America compared to any time in the twentieth
century]{.underline}**, for instance, **[and also less conflict. Warfare
in Africa is at an all-time low, as is relative US
interest]{.underline}** outside of counter¬terrorism and security
assistance.66 [**[Regional peace and stability exist where there is US
active intervention, as well as where there is not. No direct
relationship seems to exist across regions]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Peace is unrelated to hegemony.

Christopher J. **Fettweis, 2017** (Associate Professor of Political
Science at Tulane University), SECURITY STUDIES, vol. 26 2017.

Despite a few persistent, high-profile conflicts in the Middle East,
[**[the world is experiencing an era of unprecedented peace and
stability. Many scholars have offered explanations for this "New
Peace]{.underline}**,]{.mark}" to borrow Steven Pinker's phrase, but few
have devoted much time to the possibility that US hegemony has brought
stability to the system. **[[This paper examines the theoretical,
empirical, and psychological foundations of the hegemonic¬stability
explanation for the decline in armed conflict. Those foundations are
rather thin,]{.mark} as it turns out,]{.underline}** and a review of
relevant insights from political psychology suggests that unipolarity
and stability are probably epiphenomenal. [**[The New Peace can in all
likelihood continue without US dominance and should persist long after
unipolarity comes to an end]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Hegemonic stability doesn't lead to peace.

Christopher J. **Fettweis, 2017** (Associate Professor of Political
Science at Tulane University), SECURITY STUDIES, vol. 26 2017.

**[[The Horn of Africa is hardly the only region where states are free
to fight one another today without fear of serious US involvement. Since
they are choosing not to do so]{.mark} with increasing frequency,
[something else is probably affecting their calculations. Stability
exists even in those places where the potential for intervention by the

The China-U.S. rivalry in the **[[South China Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**
is certainly growing, but **[[war is still some way
off.]{.underline}]{.mark}** By Hu Bo June 12, 2020 China-US Military

Nicholas V. Huynh No one doubts that the military competition and
frictions are real and serious between China and the United States in
the South China Sea, when they have rivalrous intentions, tit-for-tat
strategies, and daily operational confrontations. China is accused of
coercing U.S. allies and partners, militarizing disputed features, and
seeking regional hegemony, and the United States is considered to be
playing the South China Sea card and containing China's rise as a
maritime power. In the context of overall intensified strategic
competition between the two countries, the South China Sea is even less
likely to be an exception. But the question remains: how fierce will the
competition be? When every day is filled with news of maritime standoffs
between China and the United States, many may wonder, **[[will China and
the U.S. slip into military conflict?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Both sides
have reasons to maintain and expand their military presence in the South
China Sea. China is the largest littoral state of the South China Sea,
and has important interests at stake: territorial sovereignty,
jurisdictional waters, and sea lanes of communication. With China's
military modernization, it is natural that more and more military
platforms are active in the area. Meanwhile the United States thinks
highly of maritime predominance, freedom of navigation, and security
commitments to regional states. Thus, since the end of World War II, the
United States has maintained the most powerful military presence and
executed a variety of complex military operations in the South China
Sea. For a long time after World War II, due to China's weak naval and
air forces, there were not many chances for Chinese and American
military forces to encounter each other at sea. However, much has
changed in the past decade. On the one hand, China's capacity has
rapidly increased, and the progress of the navy and air force is
particularly impressive. On the other hand, the United States has grown
increasingly worried about China's rising power and significantly
strengthened its naval and air presence since 2009. U.S. aircraft
sorties increased by 100 percent to about 1,500, and surface ship
presence increased by 60 percent to around 1,000 ship days per year. In
this context, frequent military- to-military encounters are inevitable.
Neither side is comfortable with the changing situation. The U.S.
military is used to being unparalleled and unchallengeable in the South
China Sea and is not ready to accommodate China's maritime rise.
Although the People's Liberation Army is already very strong materially,
it is still a novice spiritually and in the process of learning how to
interact with its American counterparts as a mature power. But
**[[neither side seems to have much to offer other than peaceful
coexistence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If both sides develop normally, in
terms of power, the future of the South China Sea would be a bipolar
region, regardless what kind of intentions they have. Moreover, most
countries in the region are reluctant to take sides in the China-U.S.
power competition. Therefore, it is hard for either side to re-establish
a dominant order here. As the power distribution becomes more balanced,
the idea of a managed military conflict is fanciful. One side's
provocation will inevitably invite the other's retaliation, where spiral
escalation is highly possible. Considering that both sides have so many
weapon platforms and both are major nuclear powers, the feasibility of a
military solution has greatly diminished. The China-U.S. rivalry in the
South China Sea is certainly growing, but war is still some way off.
**[[There are several maritime encounters between the two sides every
day, and thousands every year. Most of them are professional and safe;
only a few have involved some risks]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The recent
pandemic has made both countries and militaries more sensitive, which,
to some extent, has heightened the tension of the situation. Because of
COVID-19, China and the United States are more concerned and anxious
about each other. In addition to maintaining daily operations in the
western Pacific, both sides have some new worries. The United States is
concerned that China would take advantage of the temporary power vacuum;
thus it has deliberately shown more force and given China more
diplomatic pressure. China feels that Washington's South China Sea
policy is increasingly desperate to the point that, even during the
pandemic, the United States has not forgotten to provoke China. Beijing
is also convinced that the U.S., motivated by power competition, is
focusing on China's activities and ignoring the actions of other
claimants. From mid-April to early May, the U.S. Navy dispatched several
warships, including USS America LHA-6, to the so-called standoff area
between the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the West Capella to deter China's
operations. The PLA Navy was believed to have a similar number of
warships there at the same time, which aroused heated discussion among
the media and experts. Another less publicized but more intense case was
the reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance of China's aircraft
carrier Liaoning formation when it was conducting open sea cross-region
mobile training while followed by American warships and multiple
military aircraft. An anonymous PLA Navy officer revealed that the
confrontation was so intense that one U.S. warship even once came within
100 meters of the Chinese carrier. Even so, **[[both sides have
remained]{.underline}]{.mark}** largely **[[professional and
restrained]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In fact, neither the Chinese military
nor the American military has increased its activity significantly
compared with the same period of 2019, despite the impression given by
most media reports and expert commentaries. The problem is that these
operations are over-exposed and over-focused. In the backdrop of power
competition, especially amid the pandemic, in order to show their
strength and determination, U.S. forces have given undue prominence to
covering and publicizing military activities, giving the media and the
public a lot to discuss and imagine. There are some hawks in both
countries who take advantage of this and exaggerate the situation.
Although most countries including the South China Sea claimants, do not
want to see China-U.S. military conflict, some individual countries are
indeed rejoicing over the growing competition between China and the
United States, which may lead to some opportunity for them to expand.
China-U.S. military confrontation or even war in the South China Sea has
a huge market. **[[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates are, of course, preparing for any kind
of military conflict and the worst scenarios in the South China Sea;
however, **[[there is no indication that the two sides want to resolve
their contradictions by using force]{.underline}]{.mark}** strategically
or operationally --- despite the repeated war rhetoric from some senior
American officials. In daily military interactions, there are really
increasing risks, but in the absence of a subjective desire for
conflict, these risks are highly likely to be controlled.

### Taiwan Defense

#### No China-Taiwan war---multiple reasons---

Harlan **Ullman**, 2/18/20**22** (Senior Advisor at the Atlantic
Council, "Reality Check #10: China will not invade Taiwan,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/reality-check/reality-check-10-china-will-not-invade-taiwan/>,
Retrieved 6/15/2022)

Despite Beijing's longstanding desire to invade and conquer Taiwan and
achieve "one China," [C**[hina simply lacks the military capability and
capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of
Taiwan]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[for the foreseeable
future.]{.underline}** With a potential defending force of 450,000
Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers
to defenders taught at war colleges, to undertake an invasion, China
would need over 1.2 million soldiers (out of a total active force of
over 2 million) that would have to be transported in many thousands of
ships. Although Beijing is unlikely to launch a full-scale invasion of
Taiwan, given China's strength, autocratic government, and ambitions,
the United States cannot totally ignore the risk of such an attack. At
the same time, however, Washington should develop an overall strategy
designed to deter the most likely scenarios---such as imposing economic
and financial embargoes on Taiwan, imposing a maritime blockade of the
island, or attempting a regime change from within---or prevail
militarily if deterrence fails. China does have many other options for
pressuring Taiwan. What's the issue? The Trump administration's National
Defense Strategy (NDS) was substantially predicated on preventing two
faits accomplis: a Russian invasion of the Baltics and a Chinese
amphibious assault on Taiwan. To what degree these scenarios will
survive the Biden administration's soon-to- be-released strategic review
remains to be seen. The most likely outcome is that "integrated
deterrence," Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's term---for now more a
slogan than a strategic concept that attempts a more "wholistic"
all-of-government effort---will become prominent, as will a greater
focus on the "deter" element rather than on "defeat" as was the last
NDS. Defining what defeat means and how it would be achieved remains
elusive. Some observers believe that how the United States handles the
Ukraine crisis will be closely watched by China. That is true. But, as
this paper argues, the Ukraine crisis will not influence Chinese
decisions on whether or not to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion
because, given the force demands, China simply lacks the capacity to do
so for the foreseeable future. The current and former heads of
Indo-Pacific Command have warned about China's building the necessary
forces to invade and conquer Taiwan, possibly by decade's end. Given
China's long-standing determination to make Taiwan part of the mainland
and achieve "one China," a military takeover of Taiwan sounds plausible.
However, this notion is based on a fundamental misperception regarding
China's capability to launch a major amphibious assault. If China were
to launch such a military attack on Taiwan, what would that take in
terms of forces and force levels? Does China possess the requisite
numbers and capabilities? If not, when, if at all, might it build those
forces that, if history counts, would number in the hundreds of
thousands of troops and thousands of ships and maritime assault
vehicles? Current and past studies do not successfully or specifically
address these questions. These studies focus on the how, but not on the
specific manpower requirements of what would be required to carry out an
invasion. The definitive document on what size force would be required
to seize Taiwan in a full-out landing was drafted by the US military in
the late stages of World War II in the Pacific. In 1944, Operation
Causeway was the US plan for retaking Formosa, as it was then called,
from 30,000 starving Japanese soldiers. The planned invasion force was
double the size of Operation Overlord, the Normandy landing: 400,000
soldiers and marines deployed on 4,000 ships. With a potential defending
force of 450,000 Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one
ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, **[[China would
need to deploy over 1.2 million soldiers]{.underline}]{.mark}** (out of
a total active force of over 2 million). [**[Many thousands of ships
would be required to land all those forces, and doing so would take
weeks. How many occupation forces would be required to pacify the
Taiwanese? Surely the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq are not lost on
the PLA leadership]{.underline}**. **[China possesses a small fraction
of the necessary ships to execute a landing of that size and lacks the
capacity to do so for the foreseeable future.]{.underline}**]{.mark} Nor
are there any current plans suggesting China is intent on procuring such
a force, though that could change. **[[Further, Taiwan is not conducive
to any form of amphibious assault]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A handful of
landing sites on the west coast are blocked by proximate mountainous
areas running the length of the 250-mile-long island, some approaching
10,000 feet in height. Defenders could fall back using this difficult
terrain to wage a guerrilla war. Moreover, Taiwan lacks the
infrastructure to support over a million invaders and their logistical
needs, most of which would have to come from the mainland. **[[Fixating
on an unlikely scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}**, no matter how compelling
it sounds, [**[skews US resources and force
levels]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Nevertheless, given China's size,
strength, autocratic government, ambitions, and commitment to "one
China," the United States cannot totally rule out the possibility of an
amphibious assault. Focusing US resources primarily on such a scenario
would be a grave mistake, however. If the danger of Chinese aggression
against, and indeed an invasion of, Taiwan is considered among the
likely or plausible scenarios, the response must be to plan to defeat
that outcome. Any military conflict with the United States beyond a
Taiwan scenario would be a home game for China and an away game for the
United States and those who might be persuaded to join the fight.
Substantial resources would be needed to compensate for the
disadvantages of geography and external lines of communications. Taiwan
is only 100 miles off the Chinese coast. With China's DF-21 and other
missiles with ranges of 1,500-2,000 miles, a reinforcing naval force
would come under fire for at least two or more day's steaming before
reaching the combat area. They would also have to avoid submarine and
other maritime threats. The same problem applies to aviation units that
would enter China's air defense zones. To complicate this matter of
reinforcement and coming to Taiwan's defense, some polls show that
Americans are more worried about a Chinese invasion than are the
Taiwanese. Defending a friend is more difficult when that friend is less
preoccupied or concerned with the threat than US citizens are. The
United States cannot be successful in defending Taiwan if it regards the
Chinese threat as more dangerous than the country it intends to protect.
Finally, fixating on an unlikely scenario, no matter how compelling it
sounds, skews US resources and force levels. An expeditionary force
designed to protect Taiwan may not fit more relevant roles such as
supporting formal treaty allies, responding to other contingencies, and
influencing China by force dispositions---especially if there is no
appetite to invade in the first place. It was no accident that Napoleon
and Hitler failed to cross the 25-mile wide English Channel! The United
States must consider and plan for many contingencies with respect to
Taiwan. China has options other than a full-scale amphibious invasion.
It could seize small islands belonging to Taiwan, such as Kinmen and
Matsu, to exert leverage. It could impose economic and financial
embargoes. It could impose a physical blockade with its maritime militia
physically denying access to the island. It could attempt a regime
change from within, using the equivalent of Russia's "Little Green Men"
who seized the Crimean Parliament in 2014. China could infiltrate the
political parties and Taiwanese government and use influence operations
to change public support. It could contrive or provoke a crisis to force
Taiwan to accept a settlement that could lead to annexation. It could
obliterate Taiwan under a rain of missiles. However, unless Taiwan were
to declare independence, it is very unlikely that---barring a
crisis---China would attempt any direct annexation. Moreover, an
amphibious assault is not now a serious or feasible option. Why does it
matter? Misunderstanding an adversary in developing a strategy leads to
failure, or worse. Hitler thought Russia would fold in 1941. The
Japanese thought Pearl Harbor would force an American capitulation. Gen.
Douglas MacArthur did not believe the Chinese would intervene in Korea
as his forces raced toward the Yalu River in late 1950. Washington
believed it could bomb North Vietnam into submission, that Iraq had
weapons of mass destruction, and that Iraqis could easily takeover
governing their country after Saddam Hussein had been overthrown. The
Pentagon's civilian leaders have declared China to be "the pacing
challenge for the US military." Many Americans are fearful that a rising
China's increasing diplomatic assertiveness, military buildup,
militarizing small islets in the China Seas, and pursuit of the
ambitious Belt-and-Road Initiative is a danger not only to the United
States, but to much of the world. However, the nature of the specific
threats is not clear. A possible Taiwan invasion must be plausible and
based on why and how China could or would embark on that course of
action. Thus far, no US administration has explained how such an
invasion would be carried out. This focus on a single contingency
distorts defense planning, especially given the Russian buildup around
Ukraine. The US Army and Marine Corps are pivoting to the Pacific.
However, neither service has justified this shift beyond pointing to the
rise of China; nor have they explained how China would be contained,
deterred and, if war comes, defeated. Without a rationale for a
substantial increase of land forces in the region, it is impossible to
judge the value of this redeployment. With the Marines eliminating tanks
and much of their heavy artillery, the traditional role of amphibious
operations will have to be redefined. The Navy has long considered the
Pacific its familial home. Under the Obama administration, the Navy had
planned to shift 60 percent of the fleet to Asia by 2020. Unfortunately,
because the size of the Navy did not meet its growth objectives, the
actual number of ships in the Pacific will be less than before the
pivot. Just as the Army and Marines have not specified the rationale for
this shift except in general terms, neither has the Navy. What is the
solution? 1 Understand China's true intentions and capabilities. The
first and most obvious solution is the most difficult to achieve: rely
on objective, unbiased, fact-based analysis of the likelihood of a
Chinese amphibious invasion and the measures required to deter or defeat
it. In today's fractured, contentious, and hyper-partisan political
environment, fact, truth, and objectivity have become casualties. For
example, the current debate should cover more details over what size
force China might require in these contingencies, although Operation
Causeway would seem to be the definitive guide. 2 Learn how to win wars,
not just battles. No matter how much effort is placed on developing
policy and strategy, successive US administrations have ignored the
following contradiction: The US military has become adept at winning
battles, but the United States has become adept at losing wars. This
must change. US policymakers and strategists should take account of the
failures of the last several decades and incorporate these lessons into
discussions of what a war with China would entail and how it might end.
3 US strategy to address the threat to Taiwan must change. The US
military is based on an offensive, firepower-intensive strategy that
requires highly expensive, often vulnerable, complicated systems for
command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance, as well as large platforms that can only be produced by
major defense contractors. Many are "legacy systems," meaning that their
use was important in the past but is less so today. Today's military may
not need some of these systems, contributing to a misallocation of
resources and taxing an overly strained defense budget. However, a
Taiwanese invasion scenario---implausible though it may be---plays to
sustaining the current force design and the weapons that are being
procured. Rather than persisting with an offensive-minded approach based
on costly and vulnerable platforms, US and Taiwanese planners must adopt
a Porcupine Defense and its Pacific variant, a Mobile Maritime Defense,
to keep China's military within the first island chain that runs from
Japan in the Pacific northeast through Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines,
Indonesia, and Vietnam. The concept has been detailed elsewhere,
including in References A and B. The purpose of the Porcupine and
associated defenses, like the metaphorical quilled creature, is to
counter the enemy's strategy and disrupt any attack by deploying
daunting defensive measures that would cause great pain to an assailant
and thus complicate and deter a possible attack. In the case of Taiwan,
the Porcupine Defense entails a combination of massive numbers of drones
and unmanned vehicles along with anti-air and armor missiles, such as
Stingers and Javelins, as well as sea mines, to disrupt any attack.
Major anti-command-and-control cyber and influence operations are
essential, along with heavy use of deception and misdirection to disrupt
and confuse any enemy attack. Such a strategy would greatly complicate
any future bid by China to take the island by force. But can Taiwan be
convinced to undertake this approach? Taiwan has chosen to buy systems
to attack China. This is a mistake. Taiwan will never have the capacity
to deter a Chinese assault by threat of retaliation. However, at lower
cost, this Porcupine capability can be bought. Takeaway The overriding
issue for the United States is whether it is able to develop an overall
strategy that will deter the most likely scenarios, or prevail
militarily if deterrence fails. Such a strategy must be affordable. If
not, the United States will be pursuing the wrong response to a highly
unlikely Chinese contingency, rather than a strategy based on current
and future reality. That is not a prescription for success.

## Conflict Resolution Answers

### 1NC --- Conflict Resolution Advantage

#### 1. [TURN: AI tech increases the risk of accidents]{.underline} and false alarms---leading to nuclear conflict.

James **Johnson, 2020** (Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the James
Martin Center for Nonprolifera¬tion Studies, WASHINGTON QUARTERLY,
"Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Warfare: A Perfect Storm of
Instability?")

**[[AI technology fused with advanced weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(potentially simultaneously across multiple combat zones) could allow
these systems to react at machine speed and boost the overall pace of
combat. Despite the tactical advantages of being able to react in real
time, especially in asymmetric contested environments, **[[experts warn
that massive increases in the speed of combat could result in machines
react¬ing to combat situations at a pace that surpasses human
comprehension---so much so that commanders might be unable to
control,]{.underline}]{.mark}** contain, or terminate
**[[events]{.mark}.]{.underline}**5 Because human commanders would be
unable to react quickly enough, the decision to delegate control to an
autonomous system would be a challenging ethical and tactical dilemma.
Thus, while AI-enabled autonomous early-warning systems would
theoretically allow defense planners to identify and monitor threats
faster and more reliably than before, **[[the lack of human judgment and
supervision]{.underline}]{.mark}** coupled with the inherent brittleness
(or lack of real-world common sense to deal with new situations) and
black box (or opaque and unex¬plainable) characteristics of AI
machine-learning algorithms **[[mean that the risk of destabilizing
acci¬dents and false alarms will likely rise]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As
strategist Thomas Schelling argued, "when speed is critical, the victim
\[in this case a nuclear-armed state\] of an accident or a false alarm
is under terrible pressure."6 This point is especially true of the time
pressures associated with AI. **[[Fear created by the unpredictability
and uncertainty of an enemy conducting warfare at machine speed may,
therefore, tempt nuclear states to automate their nuclear retaliatory
capability.]{.underline}]{.mark}** That is, all else being equal, a
nuclear-armed state less confident in its second-strike capabilities
(i.e., China, North Korea, Pakistan, and perhaps Russia) will be more
inclined to use automation. **[[The high speed associated with AI and
autonomy can have]{.mark} unexpected and [escalatory
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} For example, the 2010 stock
market flash crash---which reduced the stock market value by one
trillion dollars within a matter of minutes---was, according to the US
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enabled and amplified by the
use (or misuse) of autonomous financial trading algorithms.7 Unlike the
financial markets, however, there is no overarch¬ing authority in
international relations to enforce pre-programmed fail-safe mech¬anisms
based on a shared set of rules. Thus, the prospect of a flash crash-like
event occurring in adversarial, loosely regulated, offense-dominant, and
strategically competitive domains, such as cyberspace, missile defense,
or anti-satellite weapons (ASATs), is especially alarming. **[[Military
AI systems functioning at machine speed could push the pace of combat to
a point where the actions of machines eclipse the ability of human
decision-makers to control]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or even comprehend)
[**[events]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In extremis, **[[human commanders
might lose control]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the outbreak, course, and
termination **[[of warfare.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Were humans to
effectively lose (or pre-delegate) control of warfare to machines,
**[[inadvertent escalation pathways and crisis instability would
increase, potentially with catastrophic results]{.underline}]{.mark}**.8
Compelled by the speed and pre¬cision of AI to make decisions in a
compressed timeframe, [**[a state might accept higher risks and escalate
a conflict with the belief it was in a use it or lose it
situation]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or a lack of confidence in its ability
to guarantee the safety and control of its nuclear arsenals.9

Table 3. Nuclear disarmament and emerging technologies. CSVDisplay Table
Given that experts and policymakers agreed that emerging technologies
are unlikely to carry out strategic tasks, it is perhaps not surprising
that they also believed that emerging technologies are unlikely to
supplant nuclear weapons. This is reflected in the fact that **[[most
experts disagreed that]{.underline}]{.mark}** complete **[[nuclear
disarmament would occur when leaders believe emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies [will make nuclear weapons unnecessary. This
finding strongly suggests that the value of nuclear weapons goes beyond
their roles as deterrents]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Some decision-makers
agreed, noting that not only are nuclear weapons the "ultimate security
guarantor" (Interviewee F) but they are also seen as a guarantor of
independence and sovereignty (Interviewee B). **[[These views support
the existing literature: Scholars have long recognized the symbolic
value of nuclear weapons, going well beyond their military
utility]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Abraham, 1998; Harrington de Santana,
2009; Hecht, 2012; Sagan, 1996). The view that emerging technologies are
unlikely to supplant nuclear weapons also reflects the difficulty of
verifying and monitoring the nuclear weapon ban. These difficulties have
been broadly recognized. Some scholars are positive about the potential
future normative developments (Considine, 2019; Egeland, 2018; Ritchie,
2019), others see risks associated with looking at the nuclear weapon
ban and disarmament from an arms control perspective (Onderco, 2017;
Müller, 2020).

vulnerabilities and to achieve the first-mover advantage, China, Russia,
and the United States have continued to harden their AI cyber
defenses.16 For example, open sources indicate that Chinese analysts
view the vul¬nerability of China's nuclear command, control, and
communication (NC3) systems to cyber infiltrations as highly escalatory,
even if an attacker's objective was limited to cyber espionage.17
China's fear that its early-warning missile systems are inadequate to
respond to a disarming first strike by the United States has prompted
Beijing to prioritize mitigating false negatives, when early-warning
systems fail to warn of an imminent attack (as opposed to a false
positive that warns of an attack that does not exist).18 **[[AI-enhanced

#### 4. Arms control is already strong...The NPT has already created powerful norms against proliferation, strong verification systems, and has moved the world toward nuclear disarmament.

As we mark the 50th anniversary of **[[the NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s
entry into force, there is much to celebrate. Without the treaty,
**[[the powerful norm against proliferation it
created]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its associated controls on exports of
sensitive technologies, the rigorous International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) monitoring system, and the threat of sanctions for violating
nonproliferation obligations, **[[we would be living in the world of
many nuclear-armed states]{.underline}]{.mark}** that President John F.
Kennedy predicted. As Mike points out, **[[today there are only nine
countries with nuclear weapons, the same number as 25 years ago --- a
remarkable indication of the NPT's]{.underline}]{.mark}** durability and
its [**[contribution to international stability]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
**[[Without the treaty, and the confidence provided by its IAEA
verification system]{.underline}]{.mark}** that nuclear equipment and
materials would not be diverted to the production of nuclear weapons,
the widespread use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes would not
have been possible --- not just for electricity generation, but also for
the production of isotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, and
industry. While the NPT's central goal was to prevent additional
nuclear-armed states, it sought to assure non-nuclear weapon states (who
were required to renounce nuclear arms) that the asymmetry between them
and the five original nuclear powers (who were allowed to keep their
nuclear weapons) would not last forever. It therefore obligated the five
--- China, France, Russia, the U.K., and the U.S. --- to make "good
faith" efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate their nuclear
arsenals. **[[In the last 50 years, the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited

pursued nuclear arms limitations and reductions primarily because they
believed such arms agreements would serve their own security interests,
not because they were obliged to do so under the NPT. But Mike is also
right that the NPT helped create the stable strategic framework in which
such agreements were acceptable to the superpowers. And **[[the desire

### Extensions #1: Accidents

#### AI destabilizes nuclear stability---risking escalation to all out nuclear war.

James **Johnson, 2020** (Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the James

"Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Warfare: A Perfect Storm of
Instability?")

**[[The destabilizing conditions that AI could impose have the potential

**[[stability.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The concept of nuclear or
strategic stability emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century,
and despite being theoretically and politically contested to this day,
it has proven a useful intellec¬tual tool for analyzing the potential of
technically advanced weapons to under¬mine stability. While
**[[strategic stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** has no single,
universally accepted definition, contributing factors, or even
agreed-upon metrics to measure it,33 it **[[can be best thought of as a
situation wherein no country has incentives to launch a nuclear first
strike---thus reducing the danger of a crisis caused by
miscal¬culation]{.underline}]{.mark}** or misperception **[[escalating
into all-out war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.34 It is ultimately a product of
a complex interplay of political, economic, and military dynamics in
which tech¬nology performs several functions.35 [**[The role of
technological change and stra¬tegic stability is part of a complex
interaction of disruptive forces which, during periods of heightened
geopolitical rivalry]{.underline}**,]{.mark} great power transitions,
and strategic surprise, [**[may erode strategic stability and make
conflict more likely]{.underline}**.]{.mark}36 **[[Two existing
conditions for nuclear instability likely to be exacerbated by AI are
nuclear multipolarity and differing escalation risk
tolerance]{.underline}]{.mark}** between military powers. **[[The
coalescing of these conditions in the presence of the inherently
desta¬bilizing military AI systems]{.mark},]{.underline}** described
earlier, **[[will lead to an interplay of forces ripe for
mis¬calculations]{.underline}]{.mark}** and misperceptions between
nuclear-armed states, **[[increasing the dangers of escalation and
deterrence failure under the nuclear shadow.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### AI increases the risk of miscalculation.

Mark **Fitzpatrick, 2019** (former deputy assistant secretary of state
for non-proliferation, "Artificial Intelligence and Nuclear Command and
Control," Survival, June-July 2019)

The QuantumAI aspect of the exercise was one manifestation of what the
background paper described as **[[a 'black box model
extraction']{.underline}]{.mark}** vulner-ability. Such an extraction
**[[reverse-engineers an AI system to determine its
parameters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. An adversary may be able to use this
information to enhance the effectiveness of future operations against
the system by stealing intel-lectual property; identifying sensitive or
proprietary information related to the system's training data or
objectives; or developing 'adversarial inputs' to be covertly introduced
into the original AI system. **[[Such inputs confuse the system's
classifiers]{.underline}]{.mark}** or its pattern-recognition function,
**[[thereby causing it to miscalculate, misclassify or misinterpret
elements in its oper¬ational environment.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### AI capabilities in military situations increase the risk of inadvertent escalation and instability.

James **Johnson, 2020** (Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the James
Martin Center for Nonprolifera¬tion Studies, WASHINGTON QUARTERLY,
"Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Warfare: A Perfect Storm of
Instability?")

A broader point here is that under crisis and conflict conditions, the
deterrent effect of AI is predicated on the perceived risks associated
with a particular capa¬bility it enables or enhances. The higher the
uncertainty generated by a capacity, deploying AI-augmented capabilities
in a crisis might actually encourage an adversary to act more
cautiously, and in turn, bolster stability. Thus, the uncertainty caused
by the introduction of AI into a situation might incentivize states
(especially those facing a superior adversary) to delegate decisions to
machines for the per¬ceived deterrence effect.26 Because of the
diffi¬culty of demonstrating a posture like this before a crisis or
conflict, however, this implicit threat could equally worsen crisis
instability. **[[AI systems that are pro¬grammed to aggressively pursue
tactical]{.underline}]{.mark}** and operational
**[[advantages,]{.underline}]{.mark}** for example, **[[might
misperceive]{.underline}]{.mark}** (or ignore) **[[an adversary's bid to
deescalate a situation as prelude to an imminent attack. These dynamics
would increase the risks of inad¬vertent escalation and first-strike
instability.]{.underline}]{.mark}**27

#### AI won't have a stabilizing impact on nuclear relations between states.

James **Johnson, 2020** (Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the James
Martin Center for Nonprolifera¬tion Studies, WASHINGTON QUARTERLY,
"Artificial Intelligence in Nuclear Warfare: A Perfect Storm of
Instability?")

In a world of revisionist and dissatisfied nuclear-armed states, **[[it
seems improb¬able that improvements in intelligence
collection]{.underline}]{.mark}** and analysis **[[derived from advances
in AI would have a stabilizing impact]{.underline}]{.mark}**.43 **[[For
this to happen, equal access to intelligence and shared confidence in

Non-human decision-making **[[As AI systems become more integrated into

Furthermore, as Albert Wohlstetter found, [**[the threat of mutual

known instances of accidental war, there are historical examples of
unintended escalation, either in pre-conflict crises or once a conflict
is underway.12 Accidental escalation is when a state unintentionally
commits an escalatory act (i.e. due to technical malfunction, human
error, or incomplete control over military forces).13 Inadvertent
escalation can also occur, whereby a state unknowingly commits an
escalatory act (i.e., an intentional act that unknowingly crossing an

There has been an increase in debates on nuclear disarmament, spurred by
developments such as the Humanitarian Initiative giving rise to the
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Among deterrence experts,
these debates have ushered in discussions on **[[the conditions
necessary for nuclear disarm]{.underline}]{.mark}**ament. Roberts (2019)
notes that **[[some of these conditions include the resolution of
regional geopolitical conflicts that encourage adversarial states to
acquire nuclear weapons]{.mark},]{.underline}** more sophisticated
verification measures and increased transparency of nuclear
capabilities. The recent U.S.-led initiative on Creating an Environment
for Nuclear Disarmament echoes many of these views (Gibbons, 2019).
Müller (2020) argues that **[[nuclear disarmament "will lead to the
desired result only when it is embedded in a supporting institutional
framework]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (p. 151). Importantly, Müller
recognizes that in order for non-nuclear peace to be achieved "the real,
alleged or perceived war-prevention functions of nuclear deterrence"
would have to "be taken over by other means" (pp. 151--152). To be sure,
there is much less research on emerging technologies and nuclear
disarmament through the substitution path, even though the replacement
of nuclear weapons has been, as we indicated above, on the agenda for
decades.

### Extensions #3: Cyber-Attack Defense

#### No impact to cyber-attacks:

**Lewis 20** (James Andrew Lewis is a senior vice president and director
of the Technology Policy Program at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington, D.C \"Dismissing Cyber
Catastrophe,\" Center for Strategic and International Studies. August
2020. <https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe>)

**[A [catastrophic cyberattack]{.mark}]{.underline}** was first
predicted in the mid-1990s. Since then, predictions of a catastrophe
have appeared regularly and have entered the popular consciousness. As a
trope, a cyber catastrophe captures our imagination, but as analysis, it
**[[remains entirely imaginary]{.underline}]{.mark}** and is of dubious
value as a basis for policymaking. There has never been a catastrophic
cyberattack. To qualify as a catastrophe, an event must produce damaging
mass effect, including casualties and destruction. The fires that swept
across California last summer were a catastrophe. Covid-19 has been a
catastrophe, especially in countries with inadequate responses. With
man-made actions, however, a catastrophe is harder to produce than it
may seem, and for cyberattacks a catastrophe requires organizational and
technical skills most actors still do not possess. It requires planning,
reconnaissance to find vulnerabilities, and then acquiring or building
attack tools---things that require resources and experience. To achieve
mass effect, either a few central targets (like an electrical grid) need
to be hit or multiple targets would have to be hit simultaneously (as is
the case with urban water systems), something that is itself an
operational challenge. It is easier to imagine a catastrophe than to
produce it. The 2003 East Coast blackout is the archetype for an attack
on the U.S. electrical grid. No one died in this blackout, and services
were restored in a few days. As electric production is digitized,
vulnerability increases, but many electrical companies have made
cybersecurity a priority. Similarly, at water treatment plants, the
chemicals used to purify water are controlled in ways that make mass
releases difficult. In any case, it would take a massive amount of
chemicals to poison large rivers or lakes, more than most companies keep
on hand, and any release would quickly be diluted. More importantly,
**[[there are powerful]{.mark} strategic [constraints on]{.mark} those
who have the [ability to launch]{.mark} catastrophe attacks. [We
have]{.mark} more than two [decades of experience]{.mark}
with]{.underline}** the use of **[cyber]{.underline}** techniques and
**[op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}** for coercive and criminal
purposes and have a clear understanding of motives, capabilities, and
intentions. We can be guided by the methods of the Strategic Bombing
Survey, which used interviews and observation (rather than hypotheses)
to determine effect. These methods apply equally to cyberattacks. The
conclusions we can draw from this are: Nonstate actors and most
**[[states lack]{.mark} the [capability to]{.mark} launch attacks that
[cause physical damage at any level]{.mark}]{.underline}**, much less a
catastrophe. There have been regular predictions every year for over a
decade that nonstate actors will acquire these high-end cyber
capabilities in two or three years in what has become a cycle of
repetition. The monetary return is negligible, which dissuades the
skilled cybercriminals (mostly Russian speaking) who might have the
necessary skills. One mystery is why these groups have not been used as
mercenaries, and this may reflect either a degree of control by the
Russian state (if it has forbidden mercenary acts) or a degree of
caution by criminals. **[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}** enough
**[[uncertainty among]{.mark} potential [attackers
about]{.mark}]{.underline}** the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' **[[ability to attribute]{.mark} that
[they are unwilling to risk]{.mark} massive
[retal]{.mark}]{.underline}**iation in response to a catastrophic
attack. (They are perfectly willing to take the risk of attribution for
espionage and coercive cyber actions.) No one has ever died from a
cyberattack, and only a handful of these attacks have produced physical
damage. A cyberattack is not a nuclear weapon, and it is intellectually
lazy to equate them to nuclear weapons. Using a tactical nuclear weapon
against an urban center would produce several hundred thousand
casualties, while a strategic nuclear exchange would cause tens of
millions of casualties and immense physical destruction. These are
catastrophes that some hack cannot duplicate. The shadow of nuclear war
distorts discussion of cyber warfare. State use of cyber operations is
consistent with their broad national strategies and interests. Their
primary emphasis is on espionage and political coercion. The United
States has opponents and is in conflict with them, but they have no
interest in launching a catastrophic cyberattack since it would
certainly produce an equally catastrophic retaliation. Their goal is to
stay below the "use-of-force" threshold and undertake damaging cyber
actions against the United States, not start a war. This has
implications for the discussion of **[[inadvertent
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, something that has also **[[never
occurred.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The concern over escalation deserves a
longer discussion, as there are both technological and strategic
constraints that shape and limit risk in cyber operations, and the
**[[absence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of inadvertent escalation
**[[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}** a **[[high degree of control for
cyber]{.mark} capabilities by advanced states.
[Attackers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, particularly among the United States'
major opponents for whom cyber is just one of the tools for
confrontation, **[[seek to avoid]{.underline}]{.mark}** actions that
could trigger **[[escalation.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The United States
has two opponents (China and Russia) who are capable of damaging
cyberattacks. Russia has demonstrated its attack skills on the Ukrainian
power grid, but **[neither Russia nor China would be well served
by]{.underline}** a similar **[attack on the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. Iran is improving and may reach the point
where it could use cyberattacks to cause major damage, but it would only
do so when it has decided to engage in a major armed conflict with the
United States. Iran might attack targets outside the United States and
its allies with less risk and continues to experiment with cyberattacks
against Israeli critical infrastructure. North Korea has not yet
developed this kind of capability. One major failing of catastrophe
scenarios is that they discount the robustness and **[resilience of
modern [economies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These economies present
multiple targets and configurations; they **[[are harder to
damage]{.mark} through cyberattack]{.underline}** than they look,
**[[given]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[growing]{.underline}** (albeit
incomplete) **[[attention to cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**; and
experience shows that **[[people]{.underline}]{.mark}** compensate for
damage and **[[quickly repair]{.underline}]{.mark}** or rebuild. This
was one of the counterintuitive lessons of the Strategic Bombing Survey.
Pre-war planning assumed that civilian morale and production would
crumple under aerial bombardment. In fact, the opposite occurred.
Resistance hardened and production was restored.1

than it would be in today\'s climate. anthonydibelloAnthony Di Bello,

attacked our cyber systems for many of the same reason they haven't sent
nuclear-tipped missiles: They have no reason to unless the world is in a
serious crisis, not least because they know there would be a dangerous
counterattack from the U.S." Indeed, there is general agreement that
destructive cyber attacks are unlikely unless hostile nations are
heading into war -- an armed conflict. Cyber deterrence is working. They
(hostile nation states) haven't attacked our cyber systems for many of
the same reason they haven't sent nuclear-tipped missiles.
jasonhealeyJason Healey, senior fellow, the Atlantic Council "If any
large country truly becomes a national security threat to another large
country it may well be far more likely than it would be in today\'s
climate," Di Bello said. "Barring that, it would be unlikely." For that
reason, major cyber attacks are much more likely in areas where there is
already armed conflict, or the potential for it. Robert M. Lee,
cofounder of Dragos Security and a former U.S Air Force cyber warfare
operations officer, noted that the attack on Ukraine's grid, widely
attributed to Russia, was, "simply an extension of what was going on
with the military. That, he said, would increase the likelihood of
attacks between countries like North and South Korea, or between Iran
and Israel -- "traditional conflict areas," as he put it. Of course that
leaves out terrorist organizations that don't represent any nation state
and which give no indication that it would trouble them at all to take
down the world economy. \[ MORE: Protecting vital electricity

Management to the Next Level Here are 6 best practices for improving the
efficiency of your IT asset management strategy. But Lee and other
experts said this week that smaller organizations -- even lethal
terrorist groups like ISIS -- don\'t have the same capability as nation
states. They say while the U.S. grid and other industrial control
systems (ICS) have significant weaknesses -- and U.S. adversaries are
constantly probing those weaknesses -- launching an effective, sustained
attack is not as easy as some people, including high government
officials, suggest. "**[[It is significantly more difficult to do a
high-confidence attack on ICS than people think]{.underline}]{.mark}**,"
Lee said "It doesn't just involve the cyber component -- it's the
engineering piece as well." Al Berman, president of Disaster Recovery
Institute, agreed. He said one reason is that, over the past decade,
there has been "tremendous sharing" about threat information among
utility companies. The ICS ISAC (Information Sharing and Analysis
Center) is "enormously strong," he said. A second is that most ICSs are
not completely automated. "The big ones still require manual
intervention," he said. "There are manual bypasses occurring all the
time -- people are manning centers around the clock." That, he said,
makes it more difficult for attackers to get control of a system
remotely. Third, he said, is that most utilities are privately owned and
have different software, applications and system designs. That diversity
makes it much more difficult to launch a coordinated attack on multiple
systems. Dr. Paul Stockton, managing director at Sonecon, made that
point in a recent paper titled "Superstorm Sandy: Implications for
designing a post-cyber attack power restoration system." He wrote that
**[[the diversity of systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** would likely impede
recovery efforts after a major attack, but **[[would also have the
benefit of making large-scale attacks much more difficult in the first
place]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We're in an arms race. We continue to
strengthen resilience, but we need to accelerate our efforts to defend
and respond. paulstocktonDr. Paul Stockton, managing director, Sonecon
"**[[The enormous diversity of ICS software]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
control system components among utilities **[[greatly complicates the
task of conducting a 'single-stroke' attack to black
out]{.mark}]{.underline}** an entire interconnect or [**[the U.S. grid
as a whole]{.underline}**,"]{.mark} he wrote. And according to Lee, even
with all that diversity, critical infrastructure systems are relatively
simple to defend. "They are among the few networks on the planet that
are defensible," he said. Added to that, said Lila Kee, chief product
officer at GlobalSign, is that utility providers are very much aware of
the threats, and highly motivated to defend against them. "Grid
providers don't want to be any more regulated than they are, and they
understand if they don't address cyber security vulnerabilities, the
government will do it for them," she said. "It's also important to note
that grid providers have a self interest around protecting generation
and transmission systems." Grid providers have a self interest around
protecting generation and transmission systems. lilakeeLila Kee, chief
product officer, GlobalSign Berman contends that "the mundane things --
like cable backhoes -- cause us more problems than cyber." While the
risks are real, "I spend a lot of time with utility people," he said,
"and they are dedicated and understand where attacks are taking place. I
tend to be an optimist -- I'm not so sure we're as ill-prepared as
everybody thinks." All this, experts hasten to add, does not mean that
ICS defenses are adequate. As has been noted many times, they were not
originally designed to face the Internet. And the interconnection of ICS
networks to gain automation and efficiency has simply expanded the
attack surface. And, as both Lee and Stockton note, if there is a major
cyber attack, responding to it will be much more complicated than to a
natural disaster like Superstorm Sandy. In that case, other providers
who came to assist those that had been damaged by the storm, knew they
would not confront the same storm themselves. With a cyber attack, as
Lee put it, "the adversary will be fighting your responders," in much
the same way that terrorist groups sometimes detonate one bomb, wait for
others to rush in to assist victims, and then detonate another one. The
most crucial point, Lee said, is that, "everything that everyone is
talking about is speculation, because we've never seen it (a major
attack)." Another problem he sees is that there were no collective,
international warnings to the perpetrators of the Ukraine attack. "We
didn't even have to say we knew who did it," he said, "but we should
have said that whoever did it, be warned that this is an unacceptable
act that will bring severe consequences. "This was an attack on a
completely civilian infrastructure, and now it is seen as permissible.
It's going to embolden attackers." Stockton also warns that while
terrorist organizations may lack the capability to launch a crippling
cyber attack now, that may not always be true. "They have access to Dark
Web and zero days to increasing extent," he said. "And they are becoming
increasingly sophisticated. We're in an arms race. We continue to
strengthen resilience, but we need to accelerate our efforts to defend
and respond." Lee agreed, saying that while things are improving in
securing critical infrastructure, "it's not happening nearly as fast as
it should be."

### Extensions #4: NPT Solving Now

#### Extend that the NPT is solving now---there's been a tiny amount of proliferation and the major powers have massively slashed their arsenals...proving the status quo solves the case...

#### Nuclear proliferation is in check and the NPT is tightening its inspection regimes:

and Pakistan each likely possesses between 150 and 300, with Israel's
unconfirmed arsenal totaling almost 100 bombs. North Korea probably has
a couple dozen nuclear weapons, with enough fissile material to make a
few dozen more. **[[That said, the situation is not entirely
grim]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While nuclear proliferation continues, and
nine countries are known to possess nuclear weapons, **[[the fear once
expressed]{.underline}]{.mark}** by John F. Kennedy [**[that at least a

combat. An additional achievement]{.underline}**,]{.mark} for which a
few of my colleagues here deserve some of the credit, **[[is the
tightening of inspection regimens under the NPT]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
In particular, the so-called "Additional Protocol" has created the right
for inspectors to go to places where they suspect monkey business, even
if those sites are not officially declared by the country in question.
This arrangement tends to work only if national intelligence
capabilities, and/or whistleblowers, provide information about
suspicious activities. But at that point, **[[inspectors can be more
effective than in the years before the Additional Protocol concept was
developed]{.underline}]{.mark}** and legitimated. It has helped make the
nuclear inspections in the Iran nuclear deal much more effective (even
if other aspects of that deal have proven highly controversial). A
similar concept would almost surely be used in any nuclear deal with
North Korea in the years ahead.

## Solvency

### 1NC --- Solvency

#### 1. NATO standards are ineffective in establishing interoperability on AI.

Erica **Pepe, 2020** (Senior Coordinator for Research and Conflict,
Security and Development Analyst, "NATO and collective thinking on AI,"
<https://www.iiss.org/blogs/military-balance/2020/11/nato-artificial-intelligence>,
Retrieved 6/15/2022)

NATO could play an important role in establishing interoperability
standards and norms of use in the military application of artificial
intelligence. But will allies be able to adopt a common approach in the
use of AI for defence and security and keep the Western technological
edge? By the end of 2020, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** may have in
place broad thinking on artificial intelligence (AI) as part of a wider
implementation strategy on how to benefit from emerging technologies.
The Alliance **[[could play an important role in establishing
interoperability standards along with supporting norms of use in the
military application of AI. NATO, however, has not always been
successful in establishing standards, nor in getting member states to
comply.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This makes the recently set-up NATO
Innovation Board, and its intended year-end emerging-technologies
implementation strategy, potentially all the more important. An AI White
Paper, including a proposed five-year roadmap, is already with Alliance
governments, having been submitted in July. This could lead to a more
detailed NATO AI strategy emerging sometime in 2021. The AI challenge
The Alliance has the advantage of having 30 members spending some US\$1
trillion (2020) on defence. Its wide membership, however, is also a
possible weakness if even a top-level common approach to AI cannot be
agreed. The Innovation Board's chair, NATO Deputy Secretary General
Mircea Geoană, has the task of coordinating ongoing AI-related work
across the Alliance in attempting to shape a shared vision of how to
utilise AI. This will include working to identify capability needs and
potential projects for collaboration. NATO already has some AI-related
projects under way, including the Military Uses of Artificial
Intelligence, Automation, and Robotics project and the NATO Data Science
Centre. The former project is part of the United States-led
Multinational Capability Development Campaign and is intended to look at
possible applications in areas such as air and missile defence. The Data
Science Centre's aim is to bring together existing data-science
expertise within NATO under one structure. The Alliance views AI as one
of several of what it calls 'emerging and disruptive technologies',
which it considers will likely have the greatest impact in combination.
NATO's March 2020 'Science & Technology Trends 2020-2040' report pointed
to the mix of autonomy, big data and AI, for example being used to
generate decision-relevant information from vast quantities of raw data,
as having far-reaching implications for defence and security. The report
also identified an array of 'serious challenges' that NATO faces in
managing AI, including policy, legal, ethical and interoperability
issues. It further identified the need for a common approach to how the
performance of AI-software-based systems is verified, and in turn how
the verification process is itself validated. In some ways
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** might seem a natural forum for these
deliberations, not least in a transatlantic context. It also **[has a
lot of experience]{.underline}**, going back to the Cold War, **[[in
working towards standardisation and interoperability among
allies.]{.underline}]{.mark}** However, [**[the results achieved have
been mixed, which underscores the challenges the Alliance now faces: not
only 30 members with disparate levels of capability, but also a backdrop
of rapid tech]{.underline}**]{.mark}nological **[[advances where some of
its competitors and potential adversaries may hold significant
advantages. Interoperability issues may be
thorny]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but they need to be resolved if
AI-dependent capability gaps between members are not to widen. Early
discussions regarding the establishment of common technical standards on
the design and development of military-applicable AI would at least
reduce this risk.

### A2: Democracy Add-on

#### Studies prove that democratic peace theory is flawed:

Democratic peace theory is built on the assumption that
liberal-democracy has a pacifying effect on people, a socialization
process that is assumed to lack within autocracies. **[[This paper uses
an experimental approach to investigate the microfoundations of
democratic peace theory among decision-makers of the US, Russia and
China. It builds on]{.mark}]{.underline}** and extents **[[previous
experimental studies]{.underline}]{.mark}** by conceptualizing and
measuring the presence and influence of liberal norms, by controlling
for the perception of threat as induced by the conflict, and by testing
the influence of hawkishness. **[[The results show that the
microfoundations of democratic peace theories do not find support.
Neither regime-type, nor liberal norms are of influence on the
willingness to attack the opponent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and also the
assumed difference in liberal norms between individuals of different
regime types is unsupported. Moreover, **[[hawkish decision-makers are
more likely to go to war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The results show that
democratic peace theory, which aims to explain why democracies do not
fight with each other, cannot be used as has been done till today and
should be revised. The paper concludes with suggestions for new research
avenues.

The article "Flawed Logic of Democratic Peace Theory" by Sebastian
Rosato, offers a new perspective on the logic behind the **[[democratic
peace theory]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The author first explains the
literal definition behind the theory itself. Theorist believe that with
the increase of democracies, there will be a decrease of the probability
of war. They also believe that it is important to spread the ideology of
democracy. Reason for decrease of war relies on two main factors:
norm-externalization and trust and respect. Meaning that because they
trust and respect other democracies, they are willing to work with each
other to mend any conflicts. **[[Rosato debunks this myth by providing
historical examples like the Cold War and the Great
Powers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The Democratic Peace Theory continues on
to explain that non-democratic countries are neither trusted or
respected. Non-democratic countries are not respected because their
domestic system is deemed unjust in the eyes of democracies. "Extreme
lack of public respect or trust is one of the major features that
distinguishes re- lations between liberal and nonliberal societies from
relations among liberal societies." In addition, nondemocratic countries
are often more likely to extract power by attacking or using harsh
forces. An important yet tragic example of this was displayed in
Tiananmen Square in China. War was another topic that Rosato related
democratic peace theory to. Rosato explained that **[[democratic
countries will often fight non-democratic
counties]{.underline}]{.mark}** but they still remain at peace with one
another. Democratic Peace Theory also claims that there are far fewer
reasons to go to war when there are more democracies but it's important
to note that they justify war in cases where their country's safety is
at risk. Rosato debunks this claim by mentioning Germany and the United
States conflict in World War II. As Germany progressively changed their
beliefs and policies, the relationship between Germany and the United
States started to diminish. American leaders justified the war on
Germany because they stopped viewing Germany as a democracy. This
contradicts the claim of the Democratic Peace Theory. This proves that
whether or not a country was a democracy was not a determinant for
foreign affairs and relations. This also proves that **[[there is no
clear definition of a true "democratic" country because
affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}** and opinions **[[are constantly
changing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Rosato provides concrete details that
**[[war and opposing opinions are going to occur whether or not a
country is a democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. No two countries are in
fact the exactly the same, therefore they will not always come to an
equal verdict on issues, causing a repercussion that sometimes lead to
war, famine or new polices implemented. Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed
reading this article, in fact it is one of my favorites. The theory of
democratic peace comes from an idea with historical background. As a
logical thinker, I enjoy looking at supporting evidence when forming an
opinion. Thus, I enjoyed hearing Rosato argument. Rosato used **[[many
cases of historical evidence to support his claim that the Democratic
Peace Theory has no true supporting evidence.]{.underline}]{.mark}** I
also enjoyed how he mentioned that **[[public opinion is not a
determinate on whether or not democracies will go to
war,]{.underline}]{.mark}** because if democracies did care about public
opinion then they would care about being peaceful and having good
relationships with all countries not just other democracies. This is an
interesting point but also very valid. Often times **[[democratic
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** only communicate with other democratic
counties, and **[[if they do communicate with nondemocratic counties,
they do it in an effort of forcing their views on other
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Two great examples of this that I can
think of are Vietnam and more recently in Libya.

### A2: NATO Add-on

#### NATO doesn't solve conflict---just makes war more likely:

MEDEA **BENJAMIN,** 12/6/20**19** (co-founder of CODEPINK for Peace,
"Why NATO should be obsolete,"
<https://www.salon.com/2019/12/06/nato-should-be-obsolete_partner/>,
Retrieved 6/15/2022)

The three smartest words that Donald Trump uttered during his
presidential campaign are "[**[NATO is obsolete]{.underline}**."]{.mark}
His adversary, Hillary Clinton, retorted that NATO was "the strongest
military alliance in the history of the world." Now that Trump has been
in power, the White House parrots the same worn line that NATO is "the
most successful Alliance in history, guaranteeing the security,
prosperity, and freedom of its members." But Trump was right the first
time around: Rather than being a strong alliance with a clear purpose,
**[[this 70-year-old organization]{.underline}]{.mark}** that is meeting
in London on December 4 **[[is a stale military holdover from the Cold
War days]{.underline}]{.mark}** that should have gracefully retired many
years ago. NATO was originally founded by the United States and 11 other
Western nations as an attempt to curb the rise of communism in 1949. Six
years later, Communist nations founded the Warsaw Pact and through these
two multilateral institutions, the entire globe became a Cold War
battleground. When the USSR collapsed in 1991, the Warsaw Pact disbanded
but NATO expanded, growing from its original 12 members to 29 member
countries. North Macedonia, set to join next year, will bring the number
to 30. NATO has also expanded well beyond the North Atlantic, adding a
partnership with Colombia in 2017. Donald Trump recently suggested that
Brazil could one day become a full member. NATO's post-Cold War
expansion toward Russia's borders, despite earlier promises not to move
eastward, has led to rising tensions between Western powers and Russia,
including multiple close calls between military forces. It has also
contributed to a new arms race, including upgrades in nuclear arsenals,
and the largest NATO "war games" since the Cold War. [**[While claiming
to "preserve peace," NATO has a history of bombing civilians and
committing war crimes]{.underline}**.]{.mark} In 1999, NATO engaged in
military operations without UN approval in Yugoslavia. Its illegal
airstrikes during the Kosovo War left hundreds of civilians dead. And
far from the "North Atlantic," NATO joined the United States in invading
Afghanistan in 2001, where it is still bogged down two decades later. In
2011, NATO forces illegally invaded Libya, creating a failed state that
caused masses of people to flee. Rather than take responsibility for
these refugees, NATO countries have turned back desperate migrants on
the Mediterranean Sea, letting thousands die. In London, NATO wants to
show it is ready to fight new wars. It will showcase its readiness
initiative---the ability to deploy 30 battalions by land, 30 air
squadrons and 30 naval vessels in just 30 days, and to confront future
threats from China and Russia, including with hypersonic missiles and
cyberwarfare. But far from being a lean, mean war machine, **[[NATO
is]{.mark}]{.underline}** actually [**[riddled with divisions and
contradictions]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Here are some of them: French
President Emmanuel Macron questions the U.S. commitment to fight for
Europe, has called NATO "brain dead" and has proposed a European Army
under the nuclear umbrella of France. Turkey has enraged NATO members
with its incursion into Syria to attack the Kurds, who have been Western
allies in the fight against ISIS. And Turkey has threatened to veto a
Baltic defense plan until allies support its controversial incursion
into Syria. Turkey has also infuriated NATO members, especially Trump,
by purchasing Russia's S-400 missile system. Trump wants NATO to push
back against China's growing influence, including the use of Chinese
companies for the construction of 5G mobile networks---something many
NATO countries are unwilling to do. Is Russia really NATO's adversary?
France's Macron has reached out to Russia, inviting Putin to discuss
ways in which the European Union can put the Crimean invasion behind it.
Donald Trump has publicly attacked Germany over its Nord Stream 2
project to pipe in Russian gas, but a recent German poll saw 66 percent
wanting closer ties with Russia. The UK has bigger problems. Britain has
been convulsed over the Brexit conflict and is holding a contentious
national election on December 12. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,
knowing that Trump is wildly unpopular, is reluctant to be seen as close
to him. Also, Johnson's major contender, Jeremy Corbyn, is a reluctant
supporter of NATO. While his Labour Party is committed to NATO, over his
career as an anti-war champion, Corbyn has called NATO "a danger to
world peace and a danger to world security." The last time Britain
hosted NATO leaders in 2014, Corbyn told an anti-NATO rally that the end
of the Cold War "should have been the time for NATO to shut up shop,
give up, go home and go away." A further complication is Scotland, which
is home to a very unpopular Trident nuclear submarine base as part of
NATO's nuclear deterrent. A new Labour government would need the support
of the Scottish National Party. But its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, insists
that a precondition for her party's support is a commitment to close the
base. Europeans can't stand Trump (a recent poll found he is trusted by
only 4 percent of Europeans!) and their leaders can't rely on him.
Allied leaders learn of presidential decisions that affect their
interests via Twitter. The lack of coordination was clear in October,
when Trump ignored NATO allies when he ordered U.S. special forces out
of northern Syria, where they had been operating alongside French and
British commandos against Islamic State militants. The U.S.
unreliability has led the European Commission to draw up plans for a
European "defense union" that will coordinate military spending and
procurement. The next step may be to coordinate military actions
separate from NATO. The Pentagon has complained about EU countries
purchasing military equipment from each other instead of from the United
States, and has called this defense union "a dramatic reversal of the
last three decades of increased integration of the transatlantic defence
sector." Do Americans really want to go to war for Estonia? Article 5 of
the Treaty states that an attack against one member "shall be considered
an attack against them all," meaning that the treaty obligates the U.S.
to go to war on behalf of 28 nations---something most likely opposed by
war-weary Americans who want a less aggressive foreign policy that
focuses on peace, diplomacy, and economic engagement instead of military
force. An additional major bone of contention is who will pay for NATO.
The last time NATO leaders met, President Trump derailed the agenda by
berating NATO countries for not paying their fair share, and at the
London meeting, Trump is expected to announce symbolic U.S. cuts to
NATO's operations budget. Trump's main concern is that member states
step up to the NATO target of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic
products on defense by 2024, a goal that is unpopular among Europeans,
who prefer that their tax dollars go to nonmilitary items. Nevertheless,
NATOSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will brag that Europe and Canada
have added \$100 billion to their military budgets since
2016---something Donald Trump will take credit for---and that more NATO
officials are meeting the 2 percent goal, even though a 2019 NATO report
shows only seven members have done so: the U.S., Greece, Estonia, the
UK, Romania, Poland and Latvia. **[[In an age where people around the
world want to avoid war]{.underline}]{.mark}** and to focus instead on
the climate chaos that threatens future life on earth, **[[NATO is an
anachronism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It now accounts for about
three-quarters of military spending and weapons dealing around the
globe. **[[Instead of preventing war, it promotes militarism,
exacerbates global tensions and makes war more
likely]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This Cold War relic shouldn't be
reconfigured to maintain U.S. domination in Europe, or to mobilize
against Russia or China, or to launch new wars in space. It should not
be expanded, but disbanded. Seventy years of militarism is more than
enough.

#### NATO is obsolete---not necessary to solve conflict.

**[[Despite endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive
burden on U.S. taxpayers, NATO has failed to be of much use since
then]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As its boosters like to remind us, after
9/11, the alliance invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense provision on our
behalf. But action from America's allies did not follow the grandiose
gesture---the NATO mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on U.S. forces
and effectively failed. Today, the alliance's bureaucrats and some
member states spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the
organization alive, along with a laundry list of "train and equip"
missions. Yet NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a real sense
of danger from Russia or anyone else. Among the twenty-nine members,
only the United States is really serious about its Article 3 obligations
to defend itself, spending approximately \$700 billion or 3.5 percent of
its GDP on defense. No other NATO member comes close to this proportion,
and the vast majority fail even to meet the modest, self-imposed
requirement to devote at least 2 percent of GDP to defense. Britain and
Poland are rare members that meet the 2 percent requirement. One of the
worst free-riders is Canada, which spends just 1 percent of its GDP on
security, amounting to \$20 billion. Furthermore, Germany spends a
similarly pathetic 1.2 percent. Compare that to non-NATO members facing
real threats, some of which spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense.
These include Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who must
contend with Iran and spend nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel,
which faces the same enemy, adds \$15 billion to the equation. Despite
protestations of poverty at a time when their economies have never been
larger, NATO members are more than willing to rack up additional
liabilities, knowing America has their back. Last year, the alliance
welcomed Montenegro. It is now poised to admit the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, which would mean the United States is pledged to
defend a nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to its own
defense, not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police Department. But
**[[the reality is there is no truly capable Russian foe seriously
threatening the West. Russia has one million uniformed personnel in its
military]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the world's second-largest behind
America, **[[but the E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion **[[could easily afford to match that
with its combined \$17 trillion economy---ten times larger than
Russia's.]{.mark}]{.underline}** However, it needn't bother as Moscow
spends just \$61 billion on its overwrought military, which doubles as
an employment program. Russia's Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}** has
gotten the most from Russia's military, occupying parts of Georgia and
Ukraine and gaining influence in Syria by backing the Assad regime.
Still, his **[[success]{.underline}]{.mark}** in all three cases rested
heavily on surprises that Moscow [**[seems unlikely to be able to repeat
against prepared and adequately funded European
militaries]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Yer we should expect to hear none of
this nuance at the NATO summit, as poohbahs of the dying old European
political order gather to tut-tut President Trump in the alliance's
fancy new \$1.4 billion headquarters, funded predominantly by American
taxpayers. To get out of this abusive relationship, Trump should begin
the process of limiting America\'s role in NATO. A good model is that of
Sweden, which cooperates with NATO on some matters and not on others.
Such an approach could allow joint training, but end the practice of
having over-burdened U.S. taxpayers foot the bill for wealthy
Europeans\' security. As part of this plan, Trump could mothball U.S.
bases in Europe and shift most resources spent there and in the Atlantic
to the Indo-Pacific region, where China and Iran pose real threats to
America---and against which NATO is irrelevant. **[[Europe is prosperous

### A2: North Korea Add-On

[[What a difference two years makes]{.underline}]{.mark}. The spring and
summer of 2018 saw an extraordinary rapprochement between the two
Koreas, as their leaders held successive face-to-face meetings,
culminating in a landmark visit by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to
Pyongyang. **[The [flurry of diplomacy produced a number of joint
declarations, agreements, hotlines and other confidence-building
measures]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including an inter-Korean liaison
office in Kaesong, just 6 miles into North Korean territory from the
Demilitarized Zone. It was the first full-time communication channel and
served as a de facto embassy between the two sides, which are
technically still at war having not signed a peace agreement after the
Korean War ended in 1953. Much of the progress of the past two years
came crashing down this week when North Korea used controlled explosives
to destroy the liaison building, which had been largely unused since
January due to the coronavirus pandemic. The blast, powerful enough to
shatter windows of nearby buildings, was clearly designed to send a
message. "The decision to demolish the liaison center is significant in
the sense that it was done dramatically, and with finality," Frank Aum,
senior expert on North Korea at the United States Institute of Peace,
said in an email. Pyongyang could have simply mothballed the building,
he added, but the fact that it instead chose a path of no return
"certainly suggests there are more provocations coming down the pike."
The move comes amid renewed efforts by the North to escalate tensions on
the Korean Peninsula. On June 8, Pyongyang cut off all communication
lines with the South and announced that it would start treating its
neighbor as an "enemy." The supposed reason for its anger is a South
Korean campaign, largely run by activists and defectors from the North,
to send propaganda leaflets across the border via hydrogen balloons. The
leaflets, which often describe Kim as a cartoonish dictator squandering
his country's resources on nuclear weapons, are a genuine irritant for a
regime that views information control as paramount to its survival.
Pyongyang claims the campaign violates a 2018 agreement between Moon and
Kim to halt their respective propaganda efforts. In an effort to
preserve good relations, South Korea has promised a thorough crackdown
on those responsible, introducing a law to ban the leaflets and even
suing some of the activists. [The fact that those efforts did little to
mollify North Korea suggests that ultimately, [Kim is seizing on the
leaflets to manufacture a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} He has
been dissatisfied with the diplomatic process ever since his failed
Hanoi summit with President Donald Trump in February 2019, which
collapsed without a hoped-for deal to dismantle North Korea's nuclear
program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. "I don't think it's
surprising to see North Korea taking actions that demonstrate its
frustration with the current situation," Aum said in a recent interview.
"Pretty much since Hanoi, they haven't been able to achieve what they
want in terms of sanctions relief, in terms of some of the things that
they consider aspects of a hostile U.S. policy." He pointed to Seoul's
recent purchases of American-made military hardware like the RQ-4 Global
Hawk reconnaissance drones, which are equipped with powerful radar and
surveillance equipment, as an irritant for the North. "The decision to
demolish the liaison center is significant in the sense that it was done
dramatically, and with finality," suggesting that "there are more
provocations coming." Moon, who has staked his presidency on a policy of
engagement with North Korea, has tried to keep cross-border diplomacy
alive through various proposals to increase humanitarian aid and tourism
exchanges. On Monday, Seoul proposed sending two senior officials to
Pyongyang for talks. The North, which has long made clear that its
priority is major sanctions relief, rejected what it called the
"tactless and sinister proposal" and instead proceeded to blow up the
liaison office. It also announced it would redeploy troops to frontline
areas that were demilitarized two years ago, including Kaesong and Mount
Kumgang, both of which had previously hosted joint economic projects
designed to boost inter-Korean cooperation. [The public face of North
Korea's bellicosity is Kim's sister,]{.underline} Kim Yo Jong. Much of
the harsh rhetoric directed toward Seoul in state media has been
attributed to her, leading many analysts to suspect that she is being
positioned as a potential stand-in or even a successor to her
36-year-old brother, who is overweight and a heavy smoker, with a
history of health problems. He went missing from public view for several
weeks recently, only to reemerge last month, leading to swirling rumors
that he had suffered a medical emergency. Or it could simply be that Kim
Yo Jong is serving as attack dog so that her brother can easily step
back into the role of peacemaker should tensions subside in the future.
For now, though, **[[the Kim regime's hostility]{.mark} seems [aimed at
trying to stay in the headlines and force more
concessions.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Its harsh criticism of Moon, whom
Kim Yo Jong has mocked as a flunky of the Americans, may also be an
effort to capitalize on tensions between the United States and South
Korea due to Trump's demands that the Moon administration pay billions
of dollars more to support U.S. military bases in South Korea. [North
Korea is "always looking for ways to break up the Washington-Seoul
alliance,"]{.underline} David Maxwell and Matthew Ha, of the Foundation
for Defense of Democracies, wrote recently. "A violent act that will
leave some calling for retaliatory action and others looking to find
ways to calm Pyongyang down is a great way to do that."
[[Moon]{.underline}]{.mark}, who took office in 2017, has certainly
adopted one of the most accommodationist stances toward the North of any
South Korean president in recent memory. But he **[is still [unlikely to
do anything that would]{.mark} potentially [undermine relations]{.mark}
[with the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}**, particularly as he enters the
final stretch of his single 5-year term. And nuclear talks between
Pyongyang and Washington will probably remain stalled at least until
November, as Trump campaigns for reelection with cascading domestic
crises on his hands. With diplomacy in a holding pattern, then,
Pyongyang looks set to continue ratcheting up tensions. **[[A return to
testing nuclear weapons or intercontinental ballistic missiles seems
improbable,]{.mark} as that would provoke the ire of North Korean allies
like China and Russia,]{.underline}** whose assistance is all the more
critical as Pyongyang grapples with the fallout of COVID-19. Instead, a
test of a new submarine-launched ballistic missile, or more artillery
drills and short-range projectile launches, could be in the offing.
North Korea also has a long history of bloody provocations against the
South. In 2010, during a time of heightened tensions on the peninsula,
it sank a South Korean naval ship with a torpedo, killing 46 sailors.
That same year, it shelled a South Korean island near a disputed
maritime border, killing four people---including two civilians---and
injuring at least 18 more. While most analysts see such large-scale
attacks as unlikely in the current climate, the North has always been
willing to take extraordinary risks to achieve its objectives.
Alternatively, it could try a lower-grade attack along the lines of a
2015 incident, in which Seoul accused North Korean soldiers of sneaking
over to its side of the border and placing land mines near a South
Korean guard post, causing two soldiers to lose their limbs. North
Korean state media has also ramped up threats in recent weeks against
defectors in the South, threatening to "force the betrayers and human
scum to pay the dearest price for their crimes." Given Pyongyang's track
record of carrying out assassinations on foreign soil---most notably
using a powerful nerve agent to kill Kim's half-brother, Kim Jong Nam,
at a crowded airport terminal in Malaysia in 2017---it could try similar
tactics against defectors. South Korean authorities claimed to have
intercepted at least one such attempt in 2011 to kill Park Sang-hak, a
prominent defector and activist who was involved in the recent
propaganda leaflet campaign. [Looking ahead, [much will depend on how
Moon responds to the North's saber-rattling]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Defense Ministry in Seoul promised the North will "certainly pay the
price" should it follow through on threats of military action. But Moon
has invested tremendous amounts of political capital into a policy of
inter-Korean détente and peacebuilding. He could still try to find ways
to reconcile with the North, even as his dreams of a durable peace seem
to be collapsing---literally and figuratively---before his eyes.

[After weeks of ratcheting up tensions on the Korean
peninsula]{.underline}, including lodging near-daily threats against
South Korea in reaction to some of its citizens sending anti-Pyongyang
leaflets across the border, **[North Korea has decided to
pause.]{.underline}** On 24 June, **[[North Korean state media reported
that Kim]{.mark} Jong-un [opted to defer plans to take certain military
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}**, after considering an unspecified
"prevailing situation" during a virtual preliminary meeting of the
Worker's Party Central Military Commission over which he presided. For
now, one can only guess at the reasons for the sudden pause. Did
reported U.S. B-52 bomber flyovers near Japan on 24 June, coupled with
three U.S. aircraft carriers operating in the region, deter North Korea?
Did Seoul or even Beijing make a backdoor deal with Pyongyang to provide
aid in exchange for the pause? Did Kim feel that he had vented enough
frustration about the leaflets and decide to pace himself until the U.S.
presidential election? Or perhaps North Korea never intended to take the
calibrated military actions it had threatened in the first place. There
is always the risk of miscalculation that could trigger an inadvertent
and dangerous escalation. Whatever the case may be, the reasons why
North Korea escalated tensions have not dissipated. The regime remains
frustrated, though it remains unclear how it will channel these
feelings. Pyongyang may simply be waiting to see what Seoul and
Washington do before deciding on its next move, keeping tensions
simmering on the peninsula -- for domestic political purposes and to
gain leverage in any future negotiations -- until after the U.S.
election. Even so, and although Pyongyang's threats and demolition of
the inter-Korean liaison office on its side of the border on 16 June
appear to have been undertaken mainly for their shock value, there is
always the risk of miscalculation that could trigger an inadvertent and
dangerous escalation. Pyongyang might also abruptly engage in
confrontational actions during what appears to be a quiet time --
something it has done in the past. Beijing, Seoul, Washington and other
countries with an interest in stability on the Korean peninsula should
be prepared for all these scenarios during this uncertain period. On 17
June, North Korea's military announced that it was studying plans to
deploy soldiers and "firepower sub-units" to the Mount Kumgang tourism
area and Kaesong industrial zone, restore guard posts at the
demilitarised zone, deploy artillery units and troops to the "front
lines" (near or around the border) and conduct exercises there, and
provide military assistance for "scattering leaflets against the south".
Kim Jong-un's influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, also threatened to scrap
the 2018 inter-Korean military agreement to cease hostilities on land,
air and sea. **[A close look at these possible plans reveals that none
would pose physical harm to South Korea]{.underline}**. Arguably, Kim
might have opted for a pause precisely because he concluded there was
little to gain from moving forward with plans that he realised would
have minimal impact. After all, the Mount Kumgang tours and Kaesong
Industrial Complex have been shut down since 2008 and 2016,
respectively. [Remilitarising the demilitarised zone and sending
military forces to the "front lines" would expose North Korean troop
positions. **[Scattering fliers across South Korea would do no damage to
people]{.mark} or property.**]{.underline} Pyongyang's threatened
leaflet war was expected to kick off around the 70th anniversary of the
Korean War on 25 June. It was interrupted, however, by Korea's rainy
season and winds blowing from south to north that are common during the
summer. (Early summer tends to be when South Korean activists and North
Korean defectors float anti-Kim messages northward in balloons that also
contain information about the outside world and democracy, while North
Koreans typically send their propaganda fliers in the winter when wind
currents blow south.) Pictures of the North Korean materials released by
state media show a defaced image of South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
Scribbling on the face of its leader was aiming for South Korea's
jugular in the eyes of the North, where doing the same to Chairman Kim
would be viewed as an unforgivable insult. North Korea's declaration of
a "leaflet war" against South Korea may seem silly to the outside world.
But to Pyongyang, the information South Korean fliers convey, and the
way in which they counter regime propaganda directed at the North's
people, are most threatening. In her 17 June statement, Kim's sister
said the South Korean bulletins "dared defame the dignity of our supreme
leadership, our Chairman whom we hold most sacred as the central core,
and mocked at all our people at the same time". Against this backdrop,
the announcement of preparations to bombard South Korea with millions of
paper fliers may have been intended primarily to boost morale at home
and to shore up internal unity. While not necessarily a cause for
concern in the South, the move likely would have been well received by
North Korean elites who are Kim's key constituents. To retain power, Kim
needs to be attentive to domestic political objectives including
maintaining regime legitimacy, diverting attention from the country's
domestic policy failures and satisfying his constituents. North Korea's
justification for ramping up tensions was what it sees as broken
promises and hostile acts by South Korea. According to North Korean
media, Pyongyang rejected Seoul's 15 June offer to send a special envoy
to smooth over tensions, demanding actions rather than words. **[But
behind the rage appears to be a [North Korean leadership desperate to
find solutions for the]{.mark} [country's economic difficulties.
]{.mark}]{.underline}**Pyongyang's proximate reason for threatening
South Korea was the leaflets, which it saw as violating a prior
commitment. The two Korean leaders had agreed in their 2018 Panmunjom
Declaration to cease "as of May 1 this year ... all hostile acts and
eliminating their means, including broadcasting through loudspeakers and
distribution of leaflets, in the areas along the Military Demarcation
Line". The Moon government ended loudspeaker broadcasts, but for two
years has been unable to stop South Koreans from sending fliers. When
Kim Yo-jong publicly demanded a legal ban on leaflets, the Moon
government and ruling-party lawmakers vowed to prosecute and take legal
action against activist groups. [This response was met with harsh
domestic and international criticism that such actions would violate
South Koreans' constitutional rights and democratic
freedoms.]{.underline} Pyongyang evidently judged Seoul's promises
insufficient, proceeding to demolish the inter-Korean liaison office.
Destroying the liaison office was a symbolic and calculated move. The
office was of no unique value to Kim -- cross-border communications are
possible without it -- but it was the prized symbol of Moon's engagement
policy and cost South Korean taxpayers about 9.7 billion won (\$8.6
million). It was not functioning properly due to strained relations, was
vacant because of the pandemic, and was located in North Korean
territory. Pyongyang knew the explosion would not invite retaliation as
it was not an attack on South Korea. **[[At the core of recent threats
and building destruction is the regime's]{.mark} apparent [frustration
over its domestic difficulties]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Beyond the
leaflets, at the core of recent threats and building destruction is the
regime's apparent frustration over its domestic difficulties. The
North's economic stagnation, which started with post-2016 international
sanctions intended to pressure it to return to diplomatic negotiations
and to dry up funding for its nuclear weapons program, was unexpectedly
compounded by the pandemic. [The pandemic has halted nearly all trade
with China, which had been Pyongyang's most trusted lifeline, enabling
the regime until now to defy collapse in the face of famines, natural
disasters, sanctions and other challenges.]{.underline} The best way for
the regime to divert attention from Kim's performance at home is to
deflect his constituents' gaze outward. Placing blame on the virus
itself could be harder: it would not fit the regime's self-legitimising
narrative, which holds sanctions responsible for the country's economic
woes, or match Pyongyang's official position that COVID-19 has not
infected any North Koreans. Moreover, [[Pyongyang may want to avoid
possibly annoying Beijing]{.mark}, which might see blaming the virus as
a way of subtly pointing to the trade slowdown with China as the source
of North Korea's economic difficulties.]{.underline} Instead, **[[it is
easier to]{.mark} [take the traditional route of placing the onus on
sanctions]{.mark}, and easier still to target South Korea than to take
on the U.S., which holds the cards regarding North Korea's
future.]{.underline}** At the same time, North Korean statements for
over a year, taken together, suggest that Pyongyang feels betrayed by
Seoul's confident assertions that it could persuade Washington to relax
some sanctions and allow the beginning of cross-border economic
projects. The September 2018 Pyongyang Joint Declaration between the two
Korean leaders stipulates that **[[Pyongyang was willing to dismantle
nuclear facilities]{.mark} at its Yongbyon nuclear
complex]{.underline}** "as the United States takes corresponding
measures in accordance with the spirit of the June 12 U.S.-DPRK Joint
Statement" that resulted from the historic Singapore summit between Kim
and U.S. President Donald Trump. But five months later, Kim discovered
at the follow-up summit in Hanoi that the Trump administration was not
willing to trade the sanctions relief he was seeking for Yongbyon.
Against this backdrop, Kim is now increasing pressure on the South,
implying (however fancifully) that Seoul could persuade Washington to
lift sanctions by placing a higher priority on the pursuit of pan-Korean
nationalism -- something Moon has promised to do -- even at the expense
of the U.S.-South Korea alliance. North Korea might be taking a breather
at the moment, but Moon is still faced with one of the most serious
predicaments of his single-term presidency. His dream of inter-Korean
rapprochement and peace is in crisis. Moon will try to please both
Pyongyang and Washington unless one side or the other gives him no
option but to choose. Maintaining this balance will not be politically
easy, as Moon's nationalist supporters want him to privilege
inter-Korean ties over all else, especially because they blame
Washington for soured Korean relations. It will bolster their case if
Trump continues to pressure Seoul to pay more for hosting U.S. troops or
makes a flippant remark that makes the quiet undercurrent of
anti-American sentiment in South Korea erupt. On 24 June, Pyongyang
stressed that it had merely suspended its military plans, and not
cancelled them, warning that it could always "reconsider" the
postponement. While the tone of the statement in Korean was subdued, it
nevertheless raises the question of whether the world will witness a
North Korean "October surprise" that would destabilise the peninsula in
the run-up to the U.S. presidential election. While that possibility
cannot be excluded, North Korea's interests might point it in a
different direction. Pyongyang likely would prefer Trump's re-election
because the president has shown such personal interest in making a deal
with Kim. This preference would presumably lead it to refrain from
actions that would not only risk a harsh response from Washington but
could also highlight that Trump's negotiations with Kim have met with
little success (notwithstanding his earlier boasts to the contrary) and
confront him with a foreign policy crisis in advance of the November
polls. [[Pyongyang will also likely be prudent enough to avoid any act
that could result in South Kor]{.mark}ean [injuries or
casualties]{.mark}, since Seoul would almost certainly retaliate in
kind.]{.underline} That said, there is always a risk of miscalculation.
Still, Pyongyang might take other provocative measures -- including
testing weapons, firing artillery or other shows of force. Steps like
these are not always aimed at grabbing Washington's attention. [Often,
[Pyongyang is driven by domestic political objectives]{.mark}, military
imperatives relating to perfection of its weaponry,]{.underline} or the
desire to commemorate milestones such as the 75th anniversary of its
Workers' Party in October. Pyongyang might also take such actions to
send a message -- for example, to protest U.S.-South Korean joint
military exercises, including those scheduled for August, which Moon
also promised to end in his 2018 agreement with Kim. In virtually all
these cases, an overarching goal is to create divisions between the U.S.
and its regional allies and maintain tensions on the Korean peninsula
for leverage in any future negotiations, which seem unlikely to resume
until after the U.S. election. [Washington and Seoul will need to engage
in a delicate dance that avoids providing any pretext for North Korea to
act out militarily, while sustaining readiness and
deterrence.]{.underline} Until then, Washington and Seoul will need to
engage in a delicate dance that avoids providing any pretext for North
Korea to act out militarily, while sustaining readiness and deterrence
on the Korean peninsula and seeking opportunities to advance nuclear
negotiations. In this spirit, the Trump administration should continue
to express interest in diplomacy even as it and other governments
continue to enforce UN sanctions. Countries with influence over North
Korea and an interest in peninsular stability, starting with China,
should continue to call on Pyongyang to refrain from escalation and
instead engage in dialogue. Furthermore, if Pyongyang nevertheless takes
potentially destabilising steps, Washington and Seoul should have a game
plan for responding in a measured way; in particular, they should signal
that they will beef up joint military drills if Pyongyang escalates.
[Through these measures, the parties can serve their mutual interest in
promoting peninsular and regional stability while managing the security
situation during an uncertain time.]{.underline}

[The end of the Korean War and peace on the peninsula are no more likely
to occur as the result of a peace agreement than has North Korean
denuclearization occurred as the result of multiple denuclearization
agreements]{.underline}. Ultimately, North Korean objectives matter, and
real peace does not appear to be part of those objectives. [The North
Korean regime has been very clear that its two primary objectives are
regime survival and Korean unification controlled by the
North]{.underline}. The North Korean regime has reason to be worried
about its survival, given its many failures in the last several years,
to include the difficulties it is apparently facing in just feeding the
people of Pyongyang now. The regime seems to perceive that it can
overcome its third world, impoverished conditions if it can impose
unification on the South, perhaps the only justification for the
regime's building dozens of nuclear weapons. But first, the North must
help decouple the ROK/U.S. alliance. Without U.S. extended deterrence,
the South could be vulnerable to North Korean nuclear coercion and
attacks. While we seldom consider the Korean War ending with the North's
original objective of victory, Kim Jong-un appears to be hoping to
achieve that outcome. His insistence on the importance of unification
has been a recurring theme in his New Year's addresses. Despite Kim's
dream of controlling the peninsula, a unification imposed by North
Korean nuclear coercion or attack would be unlikely to really end the
Korean War. [Seeking dominance rather than unification, a North Korea in
charge of all of Korea would probably use its hallmark brutality in
purging ROK business]{.underline}, political, and military leaders,
replacing them with North Koreans loyal to the Kim Family but so lacking
in the knowledge and experience required to run South Korean business
that they could instead destroy those businesses. **[[The North's use of
nuclear weapons would]{.mark} also probably [lead to the imposition of
substantial]{.mark} [international trade
sanction]{.mark}s,]{.underline}** which when combined with North Korean
mismanagement could gradually strangle even the ROK economy which is
heavily export-oriented---a real trade war[. [The wealth of the South
would not last long in such extreme circumstances]{.mark}, leaving the
South Korean]{.underline} [people impoverished as the North might
expropriate their residual wealth. [This is not a picture of
peace]{.mark}.]{.underline} To end the Korean War, [[the North could
abandon its designs for dominating the South]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Doing so would allow the North to abandon its quest for a major nuclear
weapon force,]{.underline} instead of investing in the welfare of the
North Korean people. After all, North Korea has not needed nuclear
weapons to defend itself against U.S. attacks since 1953. The North's
saying so is simply an excuse for building an offensive nuclear weapon
force when no defensive force is needed. Both sides could then turn to
eliminating the hostility that each feels. But [[North Korea appears far
more hostile toward the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [than
vice-versa.]{.mark}]{.underline} After all, no U.S. indoctrination tells
its people that the North Koreans are the eternal enemies of the United
States, but North Koreans are trained that Americans are their eternal
enemies from a very young age. Can there be true peace on the Korean
peninsula if such behavior continues? [Many of the sanctions against
North Korea are condition-based]{.underline}. If the North constrains
and eventually reduces its nuclear weapon program, those sanctions will
be relaxed. And without nuclear weapon threats and those sanctions, both
sides could build toward ending the Korean War. But North Korea has to
decide that it seeks peaceful coexistence and not peninsula dominance.
Is it ready to do so?

### A2: Pandemics Add-On

#### Disease won't cause extinction---we'll adapt:

Amesh **Adalja**, 6/17/20**16** (infectious-disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh, "Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human
Race?" [https://www.theatlantic.com/health/
archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/%20archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/),
Retrieved 6/12/2021)

In other words, no, I wasn't worried---and not because I have a rosy
outlook on infectious diseases. I'm well-aware of the damage these
diseases are causing around the world: HIV, malaria, tuberculosis; the
influenza pandemic that took the world by surprise in 2009; the
anti-vaccine movement bumping cases of measles to an all-time
post-vaccine-era high; antibiotic-resistant bacteria threatening to
collapse the entire structure of modern medicine---all these, like
Ebola, are continuously placing an enormous number of lives at risk. But
when people ask me if I'm worried about infectious diseases, they're
often not asking about the threat to human lives; they're asking about
the threat to human life. **[[With each outbreak
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** a headline-grabbing emerging infectious
**[[disease comes a fear of extinction itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
The fear envisions a large proportion of humans succumbing to infection,
leaving no survivors or so few that the species can't be sustained.
**[[I'm not afraid of this apocalyptic scenario]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
but I do understand the impulse. **[[Worry about the end is
a]{.underline}]{.mark}** quintessentially **[[human trait. Thankfully,
so is our resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For most of mankind's
history, infectious diseases were the existential threat to
humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at killing
people: The 6th century's Plague of Justinian knocked out an estimated
17 percent of the world's population; the 14th century Black Death
decimated a third of Europe; the 1918 influenza pandemic killed 5
percent of the world; malaria is estimated to have killed half of all
humans who have ever lived. Any yet, of course, humanity continued to
flourish. **[[Our species' recent explosion in lifespan
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost exclusively **[[the result of the
control of infectious diseases through sanitation, vaccination, and
antimicrobial therapies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Only in the modern era,
in which many infectious diseases have been tamed in the industrial
world, do people have the luxury of death from cancer, heart disease, or
stroke in the 8th decade of life. Childhoods are free from watching
siblings and friends die from outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever,
smallpox, measles, and the like. So **[[what would it take for a disease
to wipe out humanity now?]{.underline}]{.mark}** In Michael Crichton's
The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the disease-outbreak genre,
an alien microbe threatens the human race with extinction, and
humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy organism.
Fortunately, outside of fiction, there's no reason to expect alien
pathogens to wage war on the human race any time soon, and my analysis
suggests that **[[any real-life domestic microbe reaching an extinction
level]{.underline}]{.mark}** of threat probably
**[[is]{.mark}]{.underline}** just as
**[[unlikely.]{.underline}]{.mark}** When humans began to focus their
minds on the problems posed by infectious disease, human life ceased
being nasty, brutish, and short. **[[Any apocalyptic pathogen would need
to possess a very special combination of two
attributes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First, **[[it would have to
be]{.underline}]{.mark}** so **[[unfamiliar]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
no existing therapy or vaccine could be applied to it. Second, **[[it
would need to have a high]{.underline}]{.mark}** and surreptitious
**[[transmissibility before symptoms occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
first is essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens
would, by definition, have family members that could serve as models for
containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical
disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute
clinicians. The three infectious diseases most likely to be considered
extinction-level threats in the world today---influenza, HIV, and
Ebola---don't meet these two requirements. Influenza, for instance,
despite its well-established ability to kill on a large scale, its
contagiousness, and its unrivaled ability to shift and drift away from
our vaccines, is still what I would call a "known unknown." While there
are many mysteries about how new flu strains emerge, from at least the
time of Hippocrates, humans have been attuned to its risk. And in the
modern era, a full-fledged industry of influenza preparedness exists,
with effective vaccine strategies and antiviral therapies. HIV, which
has killed 39 million people over several decades, is similarly limited
due to several factors. Most importantly, HIV's dependency on blood and
body fluid for transmission (similar to Ebola) requires intimate
human-to-human contact, which limits contagion. Highly potent antiviral
therapy allows most people to live normally with the disease, and a
substantial group of the population has genetic mutations that render
them impervious to infection in the first place. Lastly, simple
prevention strategies such as needle exchange for injection drug users
and barrier contraceptives---when available---can curtail transmission
risk. Ebola, for many of the same reasons as HIV as well as several
others, also falls short of the mark. This is especially due to the fact
that it spreads almost exclusively through people with easily
recognizable symptoms, plus the taming of its once unfathomable 90
percent mortality rate by simple supportive care. Beyond those three,
**[[every other known disease falls short of what seems required to wipe
out humans---which is, of course, why we're still
here]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And it's not that diseases are ineffective.
On the contrary, diseases' failure to knock us out is a testament to
just how resilient humans are. Part of our evolutionary heritage is
**[[our immune system]{.underline}]{.mark}**, one of the most complex on
the planet, even without the benefit of vaccines or the helping hand of
antimicrobial drugs. This system, when viewed at a species level,
**[[can adapt to almost any enemy imaginable]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Coupled to genetic variations amongst humans---which open up the
possibility for a range of advantages, from imperviousness to infection
to a tendency for mild symptoms---this **[[adaptability ensures
that]{.underline}]{.mark}** almost any infectious
**[[disease]{.mark}]{.underline}** onslaught **[[will leave a large
proportion of the population alive]{.underline}]{.mark}** to rebuild, in
contrast to the fictional Hollywood versions. While the immune system's
role can never be understated, an even more powerful protector is the
faculty of consciousness. Humans are not the most prolific, quickly
evolving, or strongest organisms on the planet, but as Aristotle
identified, humans are the rational animals---and it is this fundamental
distinguishing characteristic that allows humans to form abstractions,
think in principles, and plan long-range. These capacities, in turn,
allow humans to modify, alter, and improve themselves and their
environments. Consciousness equips us, at an individual and a species
level, to make nature safe for the species through such technological
marvels as antibiotics, antivirals, vaccines, and sanitation. When
humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by infectious
disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short. In many
ways, human consciousness became infectious diseases' worthiest
adversary. None of this is meant to allay all fears of infectious
diseases. To totally adopt a Panglossian viewpoint would be
foolish---and dangerous. Humans do face countless threats from
infectious diseases: witness Zika. And if not handled appropriately,
severe calamity could, and will, ensue. The West African Ebola outbreak,
for instance, festered for months before major efforts to bring it under
control were initiated. When it comes to infectious diseases, I'm
worried about the failure of institutions to understand the full impact
of outbreaks. I'm worried about countries that don't have the
infrastructure or resources to combat these outbreaks when they come.
But as long as we can keep adapting, I'm not worried about the future of
the human race.

#### Disease risk to humans is tiny---the disads outweigh:

KATHERINE J. **WU**, 4/15/20**20** (Ph.D. in microbiology and
immunobiology from Harvard, "There are more viruses than stars in the
universe. Why do only some infect us?"
<https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/factors-allow-viruses-infect-humans-coronavirus>,
Retrieved 6/12/2021)

An estimated 10 nonillion (10 to the 31st power) individual viruses
exist on our planet---enough to assign one to every star in the universe
100 million times over. Viruses infiltrate every aspect of our natural
world, seething in seawater, drifting through the atmosphere, and
lurking in miniscule motes of soil. Generally considered non-living
entities, these pathogens can only replicate with the help of a host,
and they are capable of hijacking organisms from every branch of the
tree of life---including a multitude of human cells. Yet, **[[most of
the time, our species manages to live in this virus-filled world
relatively free of illness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The reason has less
to do with the human body's resilience to disease than **[[the
biological quirks of viruses themselves,]{.underline}]{.mark}** says
Sara Sawyer, a virologist and disease ecologist at the University of
Colorado Boulder. These **[[pathogens are extraordinarily
picky]{.underline}]{.mark}** about the cells they infect, **[[and only
an infinitesimally small fraction of the viruses that surround us
actually pose any threat to humans.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Still, as the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic clearly demonstrates, outbreaks of new human
viruses do happen---and they aren't as unexpected as they might seem. To
better forecast and prevent outbreaks, scientists are homing in on the
traits that may explain why some viruses, and not others, can make the
hop into humans. Some mutate more frequently, perhaps easing their
spread into new hosts, while others are helped along by human encounters
with animals that provide opportunities to jump species. When it comes
to epidemics, "there are actually patterns there," says Raina Plowright,
a disease ecologist at Montana State University. "And they are
predictable patterns." Crossing the species divide Most new infectious
illnesses enter the human population the same way COVID-19 did: as a
zoonosis, or a disease that infects people by way of an animal. Mammals
and birds alone are thought to host about 1.7 million undiscovered types
of viruses---a number that has spurred scientists around the world to
survey Earth's wildlife for the cause of our species' next pandemic.
(Bacteria, fungi, and parasites can also pass from animals to people,
but these pathogens can typically reproduce without infecting hosts, and
many viruses are better equipped to cross species.) To make a successful
transition from one species to another, a virus must clear a series of
biological hurdles. The pathogen has to exit one animal and come into
contact with another, then establish an infection in the second host,
says Jemma Geoghegan, a virologist at Macquarie University. This is
known as a spillover event. After the virus has set up shop in a new
host, it then needs to spread to other members of that species. Exact
numbers are hard to estimate, but the vast majority of animal-to-human
spillovers likely result in dead-end infections that never progress past
the first individual. **[[For a new virus to actually spark an outbreak,
"so many factors need to align,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** says Dorothy
Tovar, a virologist and disease ecologist at Stanford University.

Those factors include how often a virus-carrying animal encounters
humans, the means through which a virus is spread, how long a virus can
persist outside of a host, and how efficiently a virus can subvert the
human immune system. A wrinkle at any step along the chain of
transmission could foil the pathogen's attempt to infect a new species.
Even factors that seem innocuous---like above-average rainfall, or a
local food shortage---can rejigger the dynamics of how humans and
animals interact. For a virus, one of most challenging aspects of
transmission is gaining entry to a new host's cells, which contain the
molecular machinery that these pathogens need to replicate. This process
typically involves a virus latching on to a molecule that studs the
outside of a human cell---a bit like a key clicking into a lock. The
better the fit, the more likely the pathogen is to access the cell's
interior. SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, engages with
the protein ACE2 to enter cells in the human airway. For any given host,
"there's a very small number of pathogens that are able to" break into
its cells this way, Sawyer says. **[[The vast majority of the
viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}** we encounter simply bounce off our cells,
**[[eventually exit]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[our bodies as harmless
visitors]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The many faces of viruses Sometimes,
however, a pathogen manages to slip through. More than 200 viruses are
known to cause disease in humans, and all are capable of breaking into
human cells. But they almost certainly didn't start out with that
ability. The host molecules that viruses glom on to, which are called
receptors, tend to be highly variable from one species to the next,
Sawyer says. "A key property of a virus that can accomplish a zoonosis
is that it can, with a small number of evolutionary steps, adapt to use
the human version of that receptor." Viruses with a lot of genetic
flexibility, and particularly those that encode their genomes as RNA
rather than DNA, are well-suited to crossing the species divide.
Compared to viruses and cells that rely on DNA, RNA viruses tend to be
sloppy when copying over their genetic code, introducing mutations at a
high rate. This error-prone process creates an immense amount of
diversity into populations of RNA viruses, allowing them to adapt to new
environments---including new host species---at a rapid pace, says Sarah
Zohdy, a disease ecologist at Auburn University. Of the pathogens that
have infected the human population in recent decades, the majority have
been RNA viruses, including Ebola, SARS, MERS, Zika, several influenza
viruses, and SARS-CoV-2. Some viruses can also change up their genetic
code through a second method that's a bit like sexual reproduction. When
two genetically dissimilar viruses infect the same cell, they may swap
segments of their genomes with each other as they replicate, yielding
hybrid viruses that differ from both their "parents." Flu viruses, which
rely on RNA, are among those that both mutate independently and
frequently mingle their genomes---traits that have helped influenza
shuttle back and forth between an entire menagerie of wild and domestic
species, including pigs, whales, horses, seals, several types of birds,
and, of course, humans. The "perfect" pathogen Neither mutation nor
viral interbreeding, however, can guarantee spillover---and viruses that
lack one or both traits can still infect a wide range of hosts. A few
years ago, Geoghegan and her colleagues identified a slew of other
characteristics common to viruses that cause disease in humans. Their
analysis revealed that viruses seemed to benefit from hiding in their
hosts for long periods of time without being lethal. Lengthier
infections, she says, likely give these stealthy pathogens more time to
adapt and spread to new species. Many of the pathogens that jump into
people do so from rodents, bats, and non-human primates, likely due to
some combination of these species' abundance, proximity to people, and
biological similarities to humans, Zohdy says. And of course, viruses
related to known human pathogens, such as new strains of influenza and
the novel coronavirus, are always possible threats. Although many of
these microbes end up being harmless to humans, a handful of genetic
changes can make them compatible with our cells. Viral traits alone
aren't enough to predict pandemics. But as scientists continue to
catalog the diverse viruses that inhabit our planet, knowing some of
these telltale traits can help them prioritize pathogens for further
study, says Tracey Goldstein, associate director of the University of
California, Davis' One Health Institute. After a candidate virus is
identified in the field, it can be brought into the lab to see if it's
actually capable of infecting and replicating in human cells.
Traditionally, many of these steps have been performed by different
groups of researchers, with some focusing their efforts on sampling
viruses in the wild, and others sticking mostly to characterizing
pathogens in the lab, Tovar says. However, scientists can't get a full
picture of the pathogens that could put us at risk without surveillance
in the field, and they can't confirm which ones pose the biggest threats
without laboratory experiments. "So many things need to come together,
and it all matters," Plowright says. But this complexity can work in
humans' favor: The more spillover factors that researchers identify, the
more opportunities they have to intervene. Eventually, with enough
information, we might even be able to stop outbreaks before they occur.
"The amount of information we've been able to get in such a short period
of time ... is incredible," Zohdy says. "That's already giving me hope."

survives this critical period of time\-\--we might live for billions of
years, our descendants might colonize billions of solar systems, and

Various forms of AI bias are detrimental, too. Speaking recently to the

said it goes well beyond gender and race. In addition to data and
algorithmic bias (the latter of which can "amplify" the former), **[[AI

researchers are primarily people who are male, who come from certain
racial demographics, who grew up in high socioeconomic areas, primarily
people without disabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Russakovsky said.
"We're a fairly homogeneous population, so it's a challenge to think
broadly about world issues." In the same article, Google researcher
Timnit Gebru said **[[the root of bias is social rather than
technological, and called scientists like herself "some of the most
dangerous people in the world, because we have this illusion of
objectivity."]{.underline}]{.mark}** The scientific field, she noted,
"has to be situated in trying to understand the social dynamics of the

used in Florida\'s criminal justice system labelled African-American
defendants as \"high risk\" at nearly twice the rate as white
defendants. A hiring algorithm used at Amazon penalised applicants from
women\'s colleges, while a chatbot trained on Twitter interactions
started to post racist tweets. **[[The concern is that real-life data
fed into machine-learning systems perpetuate existing human
biases,]{.underline}]{.mark}** and that - as humans tend to consider
computers to be rational - **[[these biases will effectively be
sanctioned, thereby entrenching prejudice further in
society]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore, AI trained on datasets
collected in one cultural context and deployed in another cultural
context might effectively enable cultural imperialism. In response to
these concerns, big tech firms have developed principles and guidelines,
and created research groups and divisions, on ethical AI. More recently,
however, scandals have emerged over big tech employees reportedly being
forced to leave their jobs for being too critical, heightening concerns
that these companies are not taking the issue seriously enough.

**[[Have you ever considered that algorithms could bring down our entire
financial system? That's right, Wall Street]{.underline}]{.mark}**. You
might want to take notice. **[[Algorithmic trading could be responsible
for our next major financial crisis in the
markets]{.underline}]{.mark}**. What is algorithmic trading? This type
of trading occurs when a computer, unencumbered by the instincts or
emotions that could cloud a human's judgement, execute trades based off
of pre-programmed instructions. These computers can make extremely
high-volume, high-frequency and high-value trades that can lead to big
losses and extreme market volatility. Algorithmic High-Frequency Trading
(HFT) is proving to be a huge risk factor in our markets. HFT is
essentially when a computer places thousands of trades at blistering
speeds with the goal of selling a few seconds later for small profits.
Thousands of these trades every second can equal a pretty hefty chunk of
change. The issue with HFT is that it doesn't take into account how
interconnected the markets are or the fact that human emotion and logic
still play a massive role in our markets. **[A sell-off of millions of
shares in the airline market could potentially scare humans into selling
off their shares in the hotel industry, which in turn could snowball
people into selling off their shares in other travel-related
companies,]{.underline}** which could then affect logistics companies,
food supply companies, etc. Take the "Flash Crash" of May 2010 as an
example. Towards the end of the trading day, the Dow Jones plunged 1,000
points (more than \$1 trillion in value) before rebounding towards
normal levels just 36 minutes later. What caused this crash? A
London-based trader named Navinder Singh Sarao first caused the crash
and then it became exacerbated by HFT computers. Apparently Sarao used a
"spoofing" algorithm that placed an order for thousands of stock index
futures contracts betting that the market would fall. Instead of going
through with the bet, Sarao was going to cancel the order at the last
second and buy the lower priced stocks that were being sold off due to
his original bet. Other humans and HFT computers saw this \$200 million
bet and took it as a sign that the market was going to tank. In turn,
HFT computers began one of the biggest stock sell-offs in history,
causing a brief loss of more than \$1 trillion globally.

KUALA LUMPUR and BERLIN, Feb 12 2019 (IPS) - Economic recovery efforts
since the 2008-2009 global financial crisis have mainly depended on
unconventional monetary policies. **[[As fears rise of yet another
international financial crisis, there are growing concerns about the
increased possibility of large-scale military
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**. More worryingly, in the current
political landscape, **[[prolonged economic crisis, combined with rising
economic inequality, chauvinistic ethno-populism as well as aggressive
jingoist rhetoric,]{.underline}]{.mark}** including threats, **[[could
easily spin out of control and 'morph' into military conflict, and
worse, world war]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Crisis responses limited The
2008-2009 global financial crisis almost 'bankrupted' governments and
caused systemic collapse. Policymakers managed to pull the world economy
from the brink, but soon switched from counter-cyclical fiscal efforts
to unconventional monetary measures, primarily 'quantitative easing' and
very low, if not negative real interest rates. But while these monetary
interventions averted realization of the worst fears at the time by
turning the US economy around, they did little to address underlying
economic weaknesses, largely due to the ascendance of finance in recent
decades at the expense of the real economy. Since then, despite
promising to do so, policymakers have not seriously pursued, let alone
achieved, such needed reforms. Instead, ostensible structural reformers
have taken advantage of the crisis to pursue largely irrelevant efforts
to further 'casualize' labour markets. This lack of structural reform
has meant that the unprecedented liquidity central banks injected into
economies has not been well allocated to stimulate resurgence of the
real economy. From bust to bubble Instead, easy credit raised asset
prices to levels even higher than those prevailing before 2008. US house
prices are now 8% more than at the peak of the property bubble in 2006,
while its price-to-earnings ratio in late 2018 was even higher than in
2008 and in 1929, when the Wall Street Crash precipitated the Great
Depression. As monetary tightening checks asset price bubbles, another
economic crisis --- possibly more severe than the last, as the economy
has become less responsive to such blunt monetary interventions --- is
considered likely. **[[A decade of such unconventional monetary
policies, with very low interest rates, has greatly depleted their
ability to revive the economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The implications
beyond the economy of such developments and policy responses are already
being seen. Prolonged economic distress has worsened public antipathy
towards the culturally alien --- not only abroad, but also within. Thus,
**[[another round of economic stress is deemed likely to foment unrest,
conflict, even war as it is blamed on the
foreign]{.underline}]{.mark}**. International trade shrank by two-thirds
within half a decade after the US passed the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in
1930, at the start of the Great Depression, ostensibly to protect
American workers and farmers from foreign competition! Liberalization's
discontents **[[Rising economic insecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
inequalities and deprivation **[[are expected to strengthen
ethno-populist and jingoistic nationalist
sentiments,]{.underline}]{.mark}** and increase social tensions and
turmoil, especially among the growing precariat and others who feel
vulnerable or threatened. Thus, **[[ethno-populist inspired chauvinistic
nationalism may exacerbate tensions, leading to conflicts and tensions
among countries, as in the 1930s]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Opportunistic
leaders have been blaming such misfortunes on outsiders and may seek to
reverse policies associated with the perceived causes, such as
'globalist' economic liberalization. Policies which successfully check
such problems may reduce social tensions, as well as the likelihood of
social turmoil and conflict, including among countries. However, these
may also inadvertently exacerbate problems. The recent spread of
anti-globalization sentiment appears correlated to slow, if not negative
per capita income growth and increased economic inequality. To be sure,
globalization and liberalization are statistically associated with
growing economic inequality and rising ethno-populism. Declining real
incomes and growing economic insecurity have apparently strengthened
ethno-populism and nationalistic chauvinism, threatening economic
liberalization itself, both within and among countries. Insecurity,
populism, conflict Thomas Piketty has argued that **[[a sudden increase
in income inequality is often followed by a great
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although causality is difficult to prove,
with wealth and income inequality now at historical highs, this should
give cause for concern. Of course, other factors also contribute to or
exacerbate civil and international tensions, with some due to policies
intended for other purposes. Nevertheless, even if unintended, **[[such
developments could inadvertently catalyse future crises and
conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Publics often have good reason to be
restless, if not angry, but the emotional appeals of ethno-populism and
jingoistic nationalism are leading to chauvinistic policy measures which
only make things worse. At the international level, despite the world's
unprecedented and still growing interconnectedness, multilateralism is
increasingly being eschewed as the US increasingly resorts to
unilateral, sovereigntist policies without bothering to even build
coalitions with its usual allies. Avoiding Thucydides' iceberg Thus,
**[[protracted economic distress]{.underline}]{.mark}**, economic
conflicts or another financial crisis **[[could lead to military
confrontation by the protagonists]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even if
unintended. Less than a decade after the Great Depression started, the
Second World War had begun as the Axis powers challenged the earlier
entrenched colonial powers. They patently ignored Thucydides' warning,
in chronicling the Peloponnesian wars over two millennia before, when
the rise of Athens threatened the established dominance of Sparta!
Anticipating and addressing such possibilities may well serve to help
avoid otherwise imminent disasters by undertaking pre-emptive collective
action, as difficult as that may be. The international community has no
excuse for being like the owners and captain of the Titanic, conceitedly
convinced that no iceberg could possibly sink the great ship.

**[[Others have suggested building safeguards around the AGI or
superintelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They've mooted measures of
varying degrees of complexity, from denying it access to the internet,
to restricting its contact with the outside world, to trapping it in a
series of concentric virtual worlds. [**[None of these safeguards
inspire confidence]{.underline}**.]{.mark} First, as Roman V.
Yampolskiy, Associate Professor of Computer Engineering and Computer
Science at the University of Louisville, noted, **[[every security
measure ever invented has eventually been
circumvented]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "**[[Signatures have been faked,
locks have been picked]{.underline}]{.mark}**, supermax prisons had

networks have been penetrated, computers have been hacked, biometric
systems have been spoofed, credit cards have been cloned,
cryptocurrencies have been double spent...CAPTCHAs have been cracked,
cryptographic protocols have been broken," he wrote. "**[[Millennia long
history of humanity contains millions of examples of attempts to develop
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological and logistical [**[solutions to
increase safety and security, yet not a single example exists which has
not eventually failed]{.underline}**."]{.mark} Any safeguards would
eventually be circumvented either by human hackers, or acts of nature
(for example, the tsunami that caused the radiation leak at the
Fukushima nuclear reactor). Whilst a certain failure rate may be
acceptable in an enterprise where the stakes are lower, it's
unacceptable where a single leak might be all the AI needs to end
humanity's dominance.

#### Safeguards will be circumvented by the AI itself.

Then, **[[there's the likelihood that any safeguards would be
circumvented by the AI itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Indeed, **[[any
security measures our best computer scientists could devise would be
laughable to a superintelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which by
definition would be many times smarter than any human. Imagine a human
being held captive by chimpanzees. Suppose that these are unusually
intelligent chimpanzees that use state-of-the-art monkey technology to
keep the human prisoner -- perhaps they manage to construct a
rudimentary cage out of sticks. Is there any doubt that the human
wouldn't eventually escape in ways the chimpanzees couldn't possibly
think of? Perhaps he'd dig a hole under the cage, or fashion tools out
of nearby objects to help him, or remove the bars of the cage and use
them as weapons, or make a fire that burns down a portion of the cage.
One way or another, it would only be a matter of time before he found a
way free. A superintelligence would be smarter than humans in a similar
fashion. In his article "Leakproofing the Singularity: Artificial
Intelligence Confinement Problem," Yampolskiy suggested that **[[a
superintelligence could easily manipulate a human guard into letting it
escape]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It could target a guard's weaknesses,
offering him power or immortality, or promising a cure for a loved-one
with a terminal disease. **[[It could also find a bug in the system and
exploit it]{.underline}]{.mark}** (something even human hackers do all
the time). Or pretend to malfunction, and then escape when its jailors
lower safeguards to investigate. **[[Or it could escape in ways humans
aren't even aware are possible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Insulated from
the outside world, Bostrom suggested, it might find a way to generate
radio waves by shuffling the electrons in its circuitry in particular
patterns. Of course, these are just the methods our puny human brains
can imagine -- an entity thousands of times smarter would be able to
come up with a lot more. **[[Effective safeguards]{.underline}]{.mark}**
are built around power -- **[[they're not possible against a being
that's smarter, and therefore more powerful, than us. Thinking we could
contain something like that would be hubris]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Interestingly, reduced versions of the decidability problem have
produced a fruitful area of re-search: formal verification, whose
objective is to produce techniques to verify the correctness of computer
programs and ensure they satisfy desirable properties (Vardi & Wolper,
1986). However, these techniques are only available to highly restricted
classes of programs and inputs, and have been used in safety-critical
applications such as train scheduling. But [**[the approach of

**[Superintelligent machines]{.underline}**]{.mark}, those Bostrom is

**[[are equipped with powerful sensors]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and have

**[[The most obvious way to keep a super intelligent AI from getting

Unlike most defense analysts, who are content to passively observe this
process, these authors contend that **[[the intensifying arms race in
lethal AI systems constitutes a "Pandora's box]{.underline}]{.mark}**
\[魔盒\]" **[[that could lead the world to "the
apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[终结时代\]." Great Western thinkers
and innovators from Stephen Hawking \[霍金\] to Elon Musk \[马斯克\] are
cited. It is indeed noted that Musk warned in fall 2017 that **[[an AI
arms race could even be the spark for World War
III.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Western experts may smirk at a Chinese
argument that involves discussion of human rights, but Xu and Ge
articulate concern that targeted killings by drones violate a "person's
right to a fair trial." Moreover, they view the characteristics of such
robotic systems as lacking in emotion or ethical reasoning and having
"psychological distance \[心里的距离\]" that will lead invariably to
"massacres and such humanitarian disasters \[滥杀等人道主义灾难\]."
Illustrating the important point that Chinese defense scientists are
also increasingly perturbed by the possibility escalation in an AI
strategic environment, Xu and Ge evince the concern that **[[AI weaponry
"significantly lowers the threshold of war]{.mark}]{.underline}**
\[这极大降低了战争的门槛\]."

### Impact -- Cooperation on Ethical AI Will Fail

#### Transatlantic cooperation on the ethical use of AI will fail.

Foreign Relations), ARTIFICIAL DIVIDE: HOW EUROPE AND AMERICA COULD

**[[Like-minded democratic states share an interest in guaranteeing that
AI is developed and used in accordance with liberal democratic
values]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both the US and Europe say they want to
ensure that everyone can benefit equally from AI, and that competition
does not create incentives that lead to an undercutting of standards.
However, **[[despite these shared interests, transatlantic cooperation
on ethical AI may not be as easy as it first
appears.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

## Politics Disadvantage

### Politics DA Link -- 1NC

#### There are political hurdles to effective interoperability of AI in NATO.

On that note [**[NATO]{.underline}**,]{.mark} or any other international
organization, **[[is not exempt from]{.underline}]{.mark}** these
**[[political hurdles]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As EDTs increasingly
become a focal point in the geopolitical space, **[[any approach of AI
governance in the international security environment will have global
political undertones. This will undoubtedly be a significant hurdle for
NATO as it balances responsible AI development and
Allied]{.underline}]{.mark}** coordination and
**[[cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a changing geopolitical
landscape. And certainly, [**[the political realities may well represent
the greatest challenge and disincentivize NATO to emerge as a leader in
responsible military AI]{.underline}**.]{.mark} Nevertheless, the three
pillars indicate that NATO is an institution with considerable
opportunity to shape responsible AI governance. More specifically, this
entails urging and facilitating Allied standards and policies to
establish foundations for emerging military technology built on informed
and ethical principles and enhance the international security
environment.
