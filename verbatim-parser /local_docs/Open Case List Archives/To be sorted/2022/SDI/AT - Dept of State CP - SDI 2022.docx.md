Terminology

[The two terms most commonly used today for assistance to foreign
military and security forces are "security assistance" and "security
cooperation." **Security assistance is the term most frequently used,
regardless of the agency** providing that assistance.]{.underline}

**[There is no State Department definition for security
assistance]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} annual **[State
Department]{.underline}** congressional budget justification (CBJ),
however, [lists six budget accounts under the heading "International
Security Assistance." These accounts, with their underlying **Title 22**
authorities (the 1961 **FAA** and the **AECA**), are **commonly
regarded** as the State Department's **security assistance**
portfolio]{.underline}.

[**DOD formally defines security assistance as** the group of State
Department 1961 **FAA** and **AECA** programs that a DOD organization,
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (**DSCA**), **administers**.
These include programs conducted under two of the State Department
international security assistance accounts and attendant authorities, as
well as programs conducted under four related 1961 FAA and AECA
authorities]{.underline}.

[[**DOD** uses the **overarching term** **"security cooperation"** to
denote]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark} Department [security
assistance]{.mark}** [**administered by DSCA**]{.mark}]{.underline}
through which the U.S. government furnishes defense articles, military
training, and other defense-related services, [**[as well as all other
DOD interactions]{.mark}** with foreign defense
establishments]{.underline}. The purposes of the interactions with
foreign defense establishments defined as security cooperation are to
"build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multilateral operations, and provide US forces with
peacetime and contingency access to a host nation."8

**Introduction**

The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). At that time, the Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day-to-day management
responsibilities of many security assistance programs authorized by the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export Control Act (AECA).
The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain Department of Defense
(DoD)-funded international programs along with their personnel and
associated resources. In order for U.S. government (USG) agencies, the
private sector, and foreign governments to better understand DSAA's
enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security assistance (SA),
DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs while also leading the wider USG security
cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation programs
continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs), or the military
departments (MILDEPs). Further complicating the management of security
cooperation was the in-country point of contact between the USG and the
host nation. This point of contact was either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA)- sponsored Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or the
DSCA-sponsored Security Cooperation Office (SCO). These two spigots of
security cooperation within a country required a broad knowledge and
skill baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD, its agencies and the
MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of in-country
security cooperation were generally resolved with the establishment of
the Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) having oversight
over both the SCO and DAO organizations.

On 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **[formal]{.mark}**]{.underline},
yet still very broad, [[**definition** of **security
coop**]{.mark}**eration** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} Joint Pub

> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation.

[**DODD 5132.03**, [**DoD Policy** and]{.mark} Responsibilities Relating
to Security Cooperation]{.underline}, 29 December [2016, further
**defines security cooperation** with assigned
responsibilities:]{.underline}

> [**All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments** to build

> for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to allied and partner nations.
> This **includes** **DoD-administered security assistance**
> programs]{.underline}.

[According to **Title 10 [U.S. Code]{.mark} Section 301**, the term
"**security cooperation**]{.underline} programs and activities of the
Department of Defense" [means **any program, activity (including an
exercise), or interaction of the DoD with the security establishment of
a foreign country** to achieve a purpose as follows: (A) To build and
develop allied and friendly security capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations. (B) To provide the armed forces with access to
the foreign country during peacetime or a contingency operation. (C) To
build relationships that promote specific United States security
interests]{.underline}. Other DoD policy statements [[identify
**DoD-**]{.mark}managed or **[administered security assistance]{.mark}**
programs [as **components of**]{.mark} **security
cooperation**]{.underline}.

The purpose of this first chapter is to [**provide definitions** of the
various programs within **security assistance** and [the **broader
area** of **security coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}.

House Armed Services Committee Report 114-102, accompanying
[the]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Act
([NDAA]{.underline}) for Fiscal Year 2016 (H.R.1735), [includes a
provision for us to report on an inventory of DOD **[security
coop]{.mark}eration** programs]{.underline} intended to build partner
security capabilities.3 [**[DOD defines]{.mark}** these programs [as
**including DOD-administered State security assistance**]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}. [According to DOD and State officials, no
sanctioned U.S. government inventory of security cooperation and
security assistance efforts exists]{.underline}.**[4]{.underline}** In
this report, we provide a fiscal year 2016 inventory of DOD security
cooperation and State security assistance efforts that may be used by
the U.S. government to build foreign partners' capacity to address
security-related threats, including each effort's name, description,
associated legal authorities, and agency involvement as required by the
associated authorities. This inventory includes efforts that have
building partner capacity (BPC) to address security-related threats as a
primary goal as well as efforts that may have BPC as an ancillary goal
or effect.

**\[FOOTNOTE 4\]**

**[4]{.underline}** [Various government and nongovernment entities have
compiled lists of security cooperation efforts, including security
assistance efforts administered by]{.underline} the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency ([DSCA]{.underline}), [but **none of the lists** are
sanctioned by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy as
both **current** and **complete**]{.underline}.

**\[/FOOTNOTE 4\]**

[To develop an inventory of]{.underline} BPC **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** and security assistance [efforts, we reviewed
data, documents, and reports from DOD, State, RAND, and the
Congressional Research Service (CRS); conducted searches of laws; and
reviewed prior GAO reports. We interviewed DOD, State, RAND, and CRS
officials about their research on, and listings of, security
cooperation]{.underline} and security assistance [efforts]{.underline}
used for BPC [and the efforts' associated authorities; the methodologies
they used; and the limitations they encountered]{.underline}. The
efforts we selected for our inventory comprise what our sources referred
to as "programs," "subprograms," "tools," "funding accounts,"
"authorities," or "activities." We used "efforts" as the most inclusive
possible term, because the DOD and DOD-sponsored sources we consulted
used undefined and varying terminology---for example, sometimes using
terms such as "programs" and "activities" interchangeably and sometimes
including funds and the names of authorities---and because these sources
and [DOD officials did not provide DOD-sanctioned definitions of the
program and subprogram levels for security cooperation
programs]{.underline}. We broadly defined building partner capacity to
include efforts that were intended solely to build partner security
capacity as well as those that could have a partial or ancillary effect
on partner security capacity. For example, [we **included** **military
exercises**, **training**, and **equipment** as well as]{.underline}
BPC-related [**personnel exchanges** and **military
contacts**]{.underline}. [To focus our inventory on]{.underline} BPC
efforts to address [**security**-related threats, we **excluded**
efforts whose sole purpose was **humanitarian**, **health**,
**disaster**, or **development** assistance]{.underline}. To eliminate
duplicative and expired efforts, we compared the data we obtained from
these sources and reviewed associated authorities. We worked with DOD
and State officials to resolve any discrepancies, to add additional
efforts, and to group subefforts with overall efforts when the officials
made such information available. See enclosure I for further information
about our objective, scope, and methodology.

We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to March 2017 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.

"Concurrence" vs. "Coordination." [[The **reality** of the **shift in
authorities** is **more complex** than a **simple erosion**]{.mark} of
State's traditional authority]{.underline}. The 1206 authority did
provide Defense with a "train and equip" [authority that had previously
been a State responsibility]{.underline} under Title 22, but the 1206
authority [did, as does]{.underline} the 2282 [authority now, require
State "concurrence" with the Defense-developed plan]{.underline}. [So
[while]{.mark} the responsibility for the planning and programming [has
shifted to Defense, **State**]{.mark} also **[has a
veto]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[In practice, this is **not profoundly
different** than a **State**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Title 22)
[**[authority]{.mark}**, such as FMS or IMET, which is **[implemented by
DoD]{.mark}** through DSCA]{.underline}. [Previously, many DoD
authorities had required either "coordination" or "consultation" with
the State Department, which constituted a relatively weak requirement in
practice, as those terms are poorly defined and could mean as little as
a phone call notification]{.underline}. [Concurrence, on the other hand,
is a relatively formal requirement usually requiring written
documentation. And [the trend is toward]{.mark} joint, or
"[concurrence]{.mark}" authorities, [where **State has a stronger
hand**]{.mark} in the planning]{.underline}.

The issue of [[**militarization** of **fo**]{.mark}reign
**[po]{.mark}**licy [is]{.mark} a common theme]{.underline}. One of the
New York Times 100 notable books of 2016 was Rosa Brooks How Everything
became War and the Military Became Everything. In the spring of 2016
Georgetown University Press published a collection of essays entitled
Mission Creep designed to explore the Militarization of US Foreign
Policy. As far back as 2003 Dana Priest, a journalist for the Washington
Post, wrote a book entitled The Mission which asserted that American
diplomacy was being outgunned by the military and that the United States
was becoming increasingly dependent on the military to manage its role
in world affairs. She claimed that "on (president Bill) Clinton's watch
the military slowly, without public scrutiny or debate came to surpass
its civilian leaders in resources and influence around the world".
Specifically she identified the regional combatant commanders. (In
Europe the Supreme Allied Commander Europe---SACEUR) as sources of
increasing diplomatic influence. In the introduction to her book she
assets that "U.S. leaders have been turning more and more to the
military to solve problems that are often, at their root, political and
economic." This shift she argues "has been going on for more than a
decade without much public discussion or debate." Ms. Priest describes a
world in which four star generals and admirals fly around the world in
large jet aircraft, accompanied by substantial staffs to engage in
diplomatic contacts not just with ministers of defense and force
commanders but with heads of state and government as well. She asserts
that they were eclipsing the role of hapless Ambassadors who lacked both
resources and access.

It was and is still true that the Combatant Commanders have at their
disposal substantial resources. They can offer foreign governments
materiel, training and in some cases development assistance. They are
also a remarkably well-educated and impressive group. Many have doctoral
degrees. All have over thirty years of military service. They are not
amateurs. In comparison, successive administrations of both political
parties have regarded diplomacy as an amateur business, reflected in the
fact that about a third of Ambassadors are appointed from outside the
career service, often to key posts. In this new Trump administration,
politicians or business friends of the President have already been
appointed to Moscow, Tokyo, Beijing and London, continuing a practice
which goes back across the last five or six presidencies. Even more
disturbing from a career Foreign Service point of view is the
Administration's decision to appoint a non-career Director General of
the Foreign Service, for the first time in the Department's history.

For all that, Ms. Priest [may have **[overstated]{.mark}** her case.
From **[interviews]{.mark}**]{.underline} which I and my colleague Dr.
Shoon Murray carried out last year [[with]{.mark} over 20 recently
retired **[ambassadors]{.mark} from all corners of the globe**, we found
that almost **[all]{.mark}** said they **[welcomed]{.mark}** these
**[military resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They [did **not**]{.mark}
feel that the occasional high visibility visits of combatant commanders
**[undermine]{.mark}d** [their **authority** or **access** to]{.mark}
the key players in [the **host**]{.mark} **government**]{.underline}.
They saw local officials on a regular, even daily basis, while the
combatant commander would come through the capital city once or twice a
year. Indeed, they saw these generals and admirals as allies in a common
cause. One general went so far as to require his senior staff to wear
buttons which proclaimed "One Team, One Fight" to ensure the
complementarity of the military and diplomatic roles. [There were, to be
sure, **[tensions]{.mark}**, but they [arose]{.mark} largely [from
**personal friction**]{.mark} between the Ambassador and the Combatant
Commander about style and **[not]{.mark}** over issues of regional or
bilateral **[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Nonetheless for at least 15 years **policy analysts** have been
**asserting** that this growth in military power and influence has
**harmed** American **fo**reign **po**licy. It is **currently
fashionable** to say that **if your only policy tool is a hammer, every
problem becomes a nail**. **Critics**]{.underline} of the status quo
[**assert** that the]{.underline} increasingly capable and well-funded
[military has become the **instrument of choice**]{.underline} when
action has to be taken [to deal with any crisis anywhere in the
world]{.underline}.

[What is certainly true is that the military and its parent the
Department of Defense have enjoyed resources far in excess of what the
State Department enjoys]{.underline}. Ten times as much in fact. [With
resources comes capability]{.underline}. Although in recent years the
Defense Department budget has been constrained, it has always been
vastly greater than the budget of the civilian foreign affairs agencies
including the State Department, the Agency for International
Development, The Voice of America and others. The current administration
intends to substantially increase funding for the military and to give
it even greater capabilities to respond to looming crises in North
Korea, Iran, Ukraine and the Middle East, to name only a few of the
front burner crisis situations that are engrossing the attention of
President Trump and his team. The military will get more hardware. Our
nuclear capabilities will be substantially modernized.

[At the same time Diplomacy is being marginalized]{.underline}. The
State Department and American Diplomacy face radical reorganization and
resource shortages, both in budgetary and human terms, which will surely
mean dislocations and in the short term loss of operational
effectiveness. In addition, The Trump administration has proposed a
thirty percent cut in its budget. Foreign assistance is to be greatly
reduced and USAID potentially abolished or folded into the State
Department. In terms of personnel over one hundred of our most senior
officers, both men and women have gone into retirement and several
hundred more are being offered buyouts to persuade them to take early
retirement. This hollowing out of the diplomatic capabilities of the
United States can will not bring us closer to peace or a resolution of
any of the most important crises which we face. Diplomacy, by its very
nature, involves using the skills of imagination, information and
engagement to create win-win solutions for all the participants. All of
this requires training and years of experience in the field. For the
military the outcome usually must be one-sided; victory for us, defeat
for them.

What has all this meant in practical terms in terms of the Washington
policy debate?

The Trump administration and to a large extent the Republican Party
regard the eight years of the Obama administration as one in which
America failed to exert its traditional leadership role. They were
horrified when Obama was quoted during the Libyan crisis as saying that
America would lead from behind; that is, behind our European allies.
They criticized his decision to pull combat troops out of Iraq as
premature and were critical when he seemed poised to do the same in
Afghanistan. These were not trivial concerns. [The **State** Department
was **seen** to be the **agent of a 'spineless' fo**reign **po**licy,
always ready to **compromise even at the expense of vital American
interests**]{.underline}. Republicans saw the nuclear agreement with
Iran as proof that diplomacy was an inadequate first line of defense for
the United States. The State Department and its political allies in the
Democratic party repeatedly called for greater use of diplomatic and
soft power tools to advance American national interests.

The result is that for a substantial number of American voters the
Democrats were seen as the party of weakness and withdrawal. President
Trump's call to "Make America Great Again" is a reflection of this view.
His slogan also implies that for America to regain its traditional
leadership role it will have to demonstrate that it has a more muscular
foreign policy. The military will be needed as never before.

At the National Security Council, where foreign and security policies
are coordinated and policy papers prepared for the President, the first
of Trump's national security advisors went out of his way to recruit
active duty military officers to fill many of the key positions. He made
it clear that what the President wanted was a policy staff with real
world experience of war, who understood the importance and uses of hard
power and who were capable of keeping at bay the limp-wristed forces of
compromise of the State Department's diplomats. It seemed that soft
power was out and hard power in.

In all fairness it should be noted that the Democrats were not always
champions of the Foreign Service. The numbers of political appointees to
ambassadorial positions reached a record high towards the end of the
Obama administration. The appointment of political appointees in the
Department went down five or six levels in the bureaucracy in order to
assure that the president's priorities would be carried out. If
Republicans tended to think that diplomats were limp-wristed and
liberal, the Democrats often saw them as doctrinaire conservatives
unwilling to move with the liberal currents of the time.

Ironically one of the greatest defenders of the Foreign Service was the
last general to be Secretary of State, Colin Powell. He pushed through a
diplomatic readiness initiative which substantially increased the number
of Foreign Service Officers and for the first time created a 'float'
that enabled more officer to receive training.

The overall situation, however, is not so clear. Two of America's most
distinguished diplomats Ryan Crocker and Nicholas Burns recently drew
attention to the hollowing out of American diplomacy in an article
earlier this week in the New York times. They pointed out that "the
United States is facing an extraordinary set of national security
challenges. While we count on our military ultimately to defend the
country, our diplomats are with it on front lines and in dangerous
places around the world. They are our lead negotiators as we work with
our European allies in NATO to contain growing Russian power on the
Continent. They are our lead negotiators seeking a peaceful end to the
wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Our diplomats are assembling the
coalition of countries in East Asia to counter the irresponsible regime
of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un."

They are almost certainly right.

The traditional view of decision-making is that civilians do policy
creation and definition and to a large extent carry it out. Only in
extreme situation is the military called in to execute the policy. But
what happens when both the Secretary of Defense, traditionally a
civilian, and the national Security Advisor are both military men. The
danger is clearly that military values and capabilities will come to
dominate [the policy [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}. This arrangement
[seems to **[imply]{.mark}** that **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline} men
[[will **seek military solutions**]{.mark} to problems that **need
diplomatic solutions**]{.underline}.

[[**However**, **many experts** point out]{.mark} that the military
worldview is essentially conservative]{.underline}. Historically
presidents have found it hard to persuade the military to take action.
[All too often the Pentagon raises issues of resources, timing,
capabilities and emphasizes the difficulty of taking action rather than
the desirability of rushing to engage]{.underline}. They will do what
they are told to do, but [they [are]{.mark} surprisingly **[risk
averse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The lessons of Vietnam, Iraq and
Afghanistan have not been lost on them. [They shy away from options that
require boots on the ground]{.underline}. Hence the paralysis of
American policy in Syria.

Pulling in the opposite direction is the revolution in military
capabilities and the more frequent use of remote technologies which put
few American lives at risk. Stand-off weapons facilitated by satellite
or drone control seem relatively safe and often are recommended to the
President as appropriate means of punishing international malefactors
and terrorists. These [**[rapidly evolving tech]{.mark}**nologies
probably [**contribute more** to]{.mark} the **[militarization]{.mark}**
of American **fo**reign **po**licy [than]{.mark} the question of
[whether those **in charge** wear **uniforms**]{.mark} **or
not**]{.underline}. President Trump's use of cruise missiles again a
single airfield in Syria was a sign of this trend.

The discussion of resources is, in fact, complex. The military
establishment frequently complains that it lacks the resources, whether
in terms of manpower or equipment to fulfill the many tasks which the
President wants it to carry out, particularly when the time frame for
action is short. Military doctrine calls for the capability to fight two
major wars simultaneously. That, of course, requires an ability to
deploy an extraordinary range of land, sea and air forces. That well may
be beyond the current capabilities of U.S. forces.

Yet civilians and diplomats, ambassadors in particular, also complain
bitterly about the dramatic shortage of resources available for
diplomacy. The dramatic decline in morale in the State Department
reflects the perception that the political elite does not value
diplomatic skills or the expertise which diplomats bring to the table.
One recently retired senior Foreign Service Officer told a group several
weeks ago that the atmosphere inside the State Department was one of
"chaos and fear". Hiring freezes, budget cuts, politicization of the
senior policy levels in the State Department all point to this decline
in respect for the core skills of diplomacy. Diplomats are, as I have
indicated, too often seen as politically biased and, in the present
context viscerally hostile to the President. The fact that last year
over one hundred retired Ambassadors signed a letter calling on the
American people to vote against President Trump only deepened the
perception of potential disloyalty. Several recent dissent memoranda
about the withdrawal from the Paris climate accords and of the failure
to list Burma, Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of countries employing
child soldiers have further fueled the distrust of the Foreign Service.

Nonetheless the senior military leadership and the top civilians at the
Pentagon continue to be outspoken in their support for more resources
for the State Department. They, unlike their political leaders, see
diplomacy as the first line of defense. The military knows that it will
be called in only when diplomacy has failed.

In sum, [[we are **not** facing]{.mark} a **[militarization]{.mark}** of
American **fo**reign **po**licy [but the **marginalization of
diplomacy**]{.mark} as the effective alternative to military
force]{.underline}. The [denigration and dismissal of soft
power]{.underline}, even when it is renamed smart power, [has led to a
**perception** of **diplomatic weakness** and the **concomitant rise of
military influence** on the policy process]{.underline}. It is a sad
reality that there are more and more hammers in the policy toolbox and
fewer alternative weapons. The result may be that a president anxious to
make America great again and to demonstrate the effectiveness of
American leadership and power may look for a place of his choosing to
demonstrate American power. President Trump does not seem
temperamentally interested in the prolonged and protracted process of
diplomacy. His recent tweet questioning the utility of Secretary
Tillerson's efforts to engage the North Koreans in dialogue is an
example of this skepticism. In these circumstances we should not be
surprised if the United States were to decide to choose a target of
opportunity in Iran or North Korea or Syria to show off its military
might. This will not reflect the institutional militarization of
American foreign policy but rather the emotional need of many Americans,
frustrated by our loss of global standing to demonstrate that America
can indeed be great again. Neither a resourced military nor a
marginalized diplomacy should want that to happen.

**Morton 18** Christopher A. Morton, Major, United States Marine Corps,
MA candidate, Security Studies, Naval Postgraduate School, BSBA, Ohio
State University, "How Does United States Security Assistance Affect
Host Nation Democratization?" MA thesis, June 2018,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1060022.pdf> /GoGreen!

This thesis asked the question: How does United States security
assistance affect host nation democratization in U.S. Central Command's
area of responsibility? Does it support, undermine, or have minimal
effect on host nation democratization? I also investigated what U.S.
security assistance (SA) is typically designed to accomplish, how those
policies came about, and how influential U.S. SA is compared to other
factors. I analyzed evidence from case studies on Lebanon and Pakistan
to find supporting points and counterpoints for the [three main
hypotheses: U.S. SA supports host nation democratization, U.S. SA
undermines host nation democratization, and U.S. SA has minimal
influence on host nation democratization]{.underline} compared to local
and regional actors. [I concluded that United States **[security
assistance has minimal effect on]{.mark} host nation
[democratization]{.mark}**]{.underline} compared to local and regional
actors, [because it is designed and resourced primarily to accomplish
security objectives, not to drive enduring institutional
reform]{.underline}.

[Generally speaking, there is **significantly more support** for the
third hypothesis in the democratization literature]{.underline}. The
case of Lebanon supported the third hypothesis, but it also supported
the "U.S. SA supports host nation democratization" argument to a lesser
degree. The case of Pakistan supported the third hypothesis, but it also
supported the "U.S. SA undermines host nation democratization" argument
to a lesser degree. It is evident that U.S. SA is capable of affecting
host nation governance either positively or negatively, but U.S. SA is
significantly less influential than the host nation's local and regional
actors. This is an important point, because [a common argument
throughout the literature is the belief that U.S. SA is capable of
significantly impacting the host nation's institutions, political
culture, civil society, etc]{.underline}. My view is that [the
[influence]{.mark} of U.S. SA on host nation governance [is]{.mark}
**frequently [over-stated]{.mark}**]{.underline}; but if it was
resourced more heavily and designed to emphasize institutional reform,
then it could better support host nation democratization.

Does U.S. SA support host nation democratization? I argue that U.S. SA
can help prevent democratic backsliding, but it does not actively
support democratization in the way that it is typically designed and
resourced. If the United States supported host nation democratization
via its inspirational democratic example (e.g., protecting human rights
and individual liberties), then U.S. SA was not the conduit for
broadcasting the U.S. democratic example. The evidence showed that two
spikes in U.S. SA (between 0.8% and 1.4% of host nation GDP) were
quickly followed by increases in democratization, but the largest spike
in U.S. SA (upwards of 1.52% of host nation GDP, and conditioned on
democracy-related reforms) did not increase democratization. 590 If aid
conditionality supports host nation democratization, then the case
studies indicate that the threshold is between 0.25% and 0.60% of host
nation GDP.591 The evidence in both cases supported the idea that U.S.
SA reinforced host nation security, which helped prevent state collapse
and democratic backsliding, though it did not increase democratization.
If U.S. security sector assistance generally supports host nation
security sector reform---which then improved its civil-military
relations and democratic governance---then the case studies indicated
the threshold is above 10.5% of annual U.S. SA to the host nation.592
Overall, the cases provided little evidence to support this argument and
plenty of evidence to undermine it.

Does U.S. SA undermine host nation democratization? I argue that U.S. SA
does not undermine democratization as it is currently designed and
resourced, but it could have an anti-democratic influence under the same
design with excessive funding. Does U.S. SA to oppressive
authoritarians' security apparatuses undermine democratization? The case
of Pakistan revealed two increases in democracy shortly after large
spikes in U.S. SA given to military dictators, and both of those SA
packages lacked democratic conditionality.593 If this mechanism is
generalizable, then the activation threshold is above 0.85% of host
nation GDP.594 Pakistan's positive public opinion of U.S. personal
freedoms in the 2000s undermined the argument that a bad U.S. democratic
example deters host nation democratization.595 Both cases undermined the
argument that Western foreign policy created a resistance toward Western
liberal democracy. Both gave ample evidence of domestic and regional
factors that can explain different forms of host nation democracy. I
found no evidence that either country feared a Western-sponsored
democratic revolution.

[The most compelling causal mechanism was that U.S. SA (especially when
it lacks democratic conditionality) creates an aid dependency dynamic.
If U.S. SA reinforces a rentier class in the host nation society, then
it likely undermined democracy]{.underline}. Before 2008, U.S. SA to
Pakistan was below 6.14% and was followed by democratization. 596 After
the 2008 increase in democracy, Pakistan's Freedom House rating stayed
at 4.5 through 2017; and from 2010--2014, U.S. SA averaged 7.37% of
Pakistan's government revenue. 597 This causal mechanism may activate
when U.S. SA is above 6.14% of host nation government revenue, but that
assumes that Pakistan has a notable rentier dynamic. If Pakistan does
have a rentier dynamic, then U.S. SA was a notable contributor to it. I
found that Pakistan's military economy predated U.S. SA, and so U.S. SA
may have entrenched it slightly, but it did not alter the fundamental
dynamic of state governance. In short, U.S. SA and other aid sources
were insufficient to create a rentier dynamic that did not already
exist.

I argue that U.S. SA has minimal influence on host nation
democratization compared to domestic and regional actors. It is designed
to accomplish U.S. security objectives. [The programs capable of driving
institutional reform are a meager share of overall U.S. SA. U.S. SA is
rarely integrated with a whole-of-government effort for supporting host
nation democratization, and when one could argue it is, the quantity and
duration of funding is inadequate to supersede the influence of domestic
and regional actors]{.underline}. When the host nation's security
interests diverge from those of the United States (e.g., post-9/11
Pakistan), the resulting agency loss increases the threshold of U.S. SA
necessary to have a significant influence. Despite the stated theme of
democracy promotion in U.S. policy documents, U.S. SA was primarily
designed to accomplish security objectives. By design it was not able to
compete with domestic and regional actors, and by quantity it is not
enough to significantly influence host nation democratization.

B. POLICY IMPLICATIONS

The United States can pursue its security objectives and democratization
agenda somewhat independently in accordance with its typical design and
resourcing of U.S. SA. [There is a continual **debate** in U.S. foreign
policy circles regarding whether or not to use **aid conditionality** to
**incentivize democratization** or to allow U.S. SA to focus solely on
security objectives without constraints relating to host nation
governance]{.underline}.598 [I found [**no evidence** that
**democracy-related aid conditionality** on]{.mark} "traditional" forms
of U.S. [**SA** **influenced host nation
democratization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which means that such
conditionality should be applied for other purposes (e.g., to satisfy
U.S. legal requirement or political sensitivities).

[If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [wants to decisively
support host nation democratization, then U.S. SA should go to
recipients with good democratic prospects in sufficient quantity for
adequate duration. U.S. [SA **would need to be**]{.mark} **designed as
[part of a whole-of-government]{.mark} support [package]{.mark} and
[implemented for a generation or more]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It [would
**need to exceed 1.5**]{.mark}**2[%]{.mark} [of host]{.mark} nation
[GDP]{.mark}** and increasingly emphasize defense institution building
programs and other programs that bolster host nation civil-military
relations]{.underline}. 599 [[**Anything less** is **unlikely** to
support]{.mark} host nation **[democratization]{.mark}**
decisively]{.underline}. How would a head of state decide where to
commit its resources to promote democracy if it cannot afford to take
this approach worldwide? I concur with Ottaway that there are two basic
choices. The United States can lower its democracy promotion policy
ambitions and settle for sub-standard democracies, or it can abandon
some countries in which democratic prospects are particularly dim and
focus its resources on countries that are more likely to democratize.600
U.S. SA would go to states that largely share U.S. security interests
(which reduces agency loss); have a high GDP, a history of democracy,
and some form of civil society (which supports democratic
consolidation); have neighboring democratic examples; have host nation
elites willing to democratize; and have the institutional capacity to
absorb the assistance.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall we have [seen]{.underline} a steady
outpouring of books and [articles lamenting the trend]{.underline} in
Washington [to see foreign policy through a military lens]{.underline}:
Rosa Brooks' How Everything Became War and the Military Became
Everything, Lorelei Kelly's Unbalanced Security: The Divide between
State and Defense, and Gordon Adams and Shoon Murray's Mission
Creep---The Militarization of U.S. Foreign Policy, among others.

Why might one have this view? Is it that the [**Defense** Department's
huge **budget**, **personnel** and other **capabilities** give it an
**advantage**]{.underline}? Is it due to how the military is
organized---with [geographic combatant commands]{.underline} that [have
**effective control** over policy and activities across their areas of
responsibility, whereas **[State's]{.mark} regional bureaus** are
**misaligned** with military counterparts and assistant secretaries deal
via **turf-conscious** bilateral ambassadors]{.underline} numbering up
to 40 or more, and have little say over how USAID spends its money?

Has [Foggy Bottom **[lost relevance]{.mark}** in the foreign affairs
arena [by emphasizing **soft-power social agendas**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., the creation of special envoys for various religions, LGBTQ, the
Holocaust, global youth and global women's affairs) that are distinctly
American [over hard-power national security interests]{.underline}
(e.g., strong international security and healthy economic systems that
protect allies and provide opportunities for American businesses)? Or is
it, perhaps, simply that the Foreign Service is either late in arriving
or missing from the field where the military is operating?

The answer, [of course]{.underline}, is **[all of the
above]{.underline}**. But there are two broad aspects of the problem
that I believe are fundamental: first, the proliferation of priorities
at the State Department following the end of the Cold War; and second,
the missed opportunities at State during the past 20 years of joint
operations with the military to institutionalize the kind of
professional and personal relationships that would enable the smaller
Foreign Service to exert leadership in the foreign policy arena at home
and abroad.

A Proliferation of Priorities

The end of the Cold War and the so-called "end of history" marked a
shift for the State Department. We hired a more diverse Foreign Service
that, in turn, took on a broader range of narrower activities that more
resemble small-picture social engineering than traditional, big-picture
diplomacy. At the same time, [State reallocated existing resources to
create an alphabet soup of new under secretaries, functional bureaus,
offices and special envoys]{.underline}. At its peak during the Obama
administration, there were [more than 50]{.underline} of the latter. As
Ambassador Jim Jeffrey observes in a March 3 piece in Foreign Policy,
neither the 2010 nor the 2015 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development
Review focuses on "traditional" diplomacy. [The department has
[**diffused its energy too broadly** to the **neglect of
fundamentals**]{.mark}, and [this]{.mark}, in turn, **[left a
vacuum]{.mark}** that [the **military has had to
fill**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

New State Department priorities include such things as this, for
example. In Muslim-majority Indonesia in 2014 and 2015, not long before
the deadly January 2016 extremist terrorist attack on Starbucks and
other locations rocked the capital, Jakarta, our consulate in Surabaya
produced impressive Hispanic heritage month YouTube videos of its
celebrations, which included spending money to bring Los Angeles artists
to paint murals on the walls of a local school and sponsor fun runs for
local girls. Similarly, in March the U.S. embassy in Macedonia---a
country with simmering interethnic tensions and endemic corruption that
hasn't had a government since elections in early December 2016---flew in
a lawyer from the Office of the Special Counsel to lecture locals on the
Hatch Act, even as refugees streamed north from Greece and European-born
Islamic State group fighters returned from Syrian battlefields.

A solely military response is not sufficient. We want to increasingly
involve other elements of the U.S. government and the international
community, recognizing that it is only through a combination of
capabilities that we will achieve and sustain our strongest deterrence
posture.

---General Joseph Votel,

Commander, U.S. Central Command,

March 9, 2017

In religiously conservative Uganda, a U.S. Army commander there to train
units in combating the Lord's Resistance Army and al-Shabaab in Somalia
had to deal with backlash from an angry counterpart when the U.S.
embassy flew the rainbow flag high over Kampala in a righteous response
to that country's persecution of the LGBTQ community. That subsequently
set back efforts to combat other forms of violent abuses of human rights
in eastern Africa.

One general commented, "If everything is a priority for the State
Department, nothing is."

[On its own, each example represents admirable [commitment]{.mark} by
the Foreign Service [to]{.mark} human rights, social progress and good
[governance]{.mark} policy efforts. But collectively, that commitment
[ignores the **opportunity cost** of]{.mark} not prioritizing activities
more immediate to countering violent extremism]{.underline}, promoting
economic prosperity [and strengthening the security necessary to address
higher-order human rights and civic goals]{.underline}.

[The [proliferation of activities that **pander** to]{.mark} U.S.
[**domestic special interests** and **divert resources**]{.mark} from
other work, and whose effectiveness cannot easily be measured, is one
aspect of the **[creeping irrelevance]{.mark}** of American
diplomacy]{.underline}. This problem has been [[compounded by]{.mark}

\*added \[overlooked\]

With dozens of treaty allies and a strategic priority of promoting the
sovereignty of weak states, [the U.S. **[military]{.mark}** has been
gradually **[shifting]{.mark}** from a force designed for confrontation
[to]{.mark} one intended to promote international
**cooperation**]{.underline}. To be sure, the U.S. military retains a
technical and doctrinal advantage as a warfighting entity. However, over
the past two decades, the military has been incorporating new
organizations, doctrine, and training to prioritize efforts to prevent
war [through **[security]{.mark} force
[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has shifted focus to weak
states where sub-national (e.g., gangs in Central America) and
trans-national security challenges (e.g., al-Qa'ida) jeopardize
sovereignty and regional stability.1 Consequently, countries such as the
Philippines, Georgia, Colombia, Uganda, and Pakistan have requested
security assistance from the United States. While level of support
varies, U.S. forces are enabling partner countries to combat challenges
that threaten their own stability.

[This shift in focus has **raised concerns** about the
"**militarization** of U.S. **fo**reign **po**licy,"]{.underline} which
began in the 1990s with the recognition that combatant commanders are as
much policy entrepreneurs as they are war fighters.2 Generals like Tony
Zinni or Wesley Clark epitomized the new breed of warrior-diplomat who
directly engaged with foreign heads of state.3 Far from rogue generals,
these military leaders were directed by President Bill Clinton to engage
with the world and promote security by assisting partners and assuring
allies in a security environment freed from the Cold War dynamic.
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama continued the
practice of using the military to assist almost every government of the
world. As Administrations from both parties came to value the military's
capabilities in peace and war, [some contended that defense overshadowed
(if not displaced) traditional diplomacy and development
efforts]{.underline}.4 Within defense circles, [critics assumed that
helping weak states **jeopardized** American **military dominance** and
**undercut preparations for major war**]{.underline}.5 More recently,
[critics highlight that in an era of declining budgets, the]{.underline}
United States [military cannot afford nor overcome **unintended
consequences** of attempting to be a "global force for
good."]{.underline}6 These are valid concerns, **[but]{.underline}** the
United States shows no signs of retreating from a global leadership role
and instead seeks partnerships as a key component of U.S. strategy.

With shared challenges of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and
shared goals of development and protecting human security, there are
unprecedented levels of international cooperation to share information,
target terrorists, and provide governments the tools they need to
confront national threats before they become regional ones. This is on
display in Afghanistan where 50 countries operate under the ISAF flag,
or in the Indian Ocean where 27 countries operate as Combined Maritime
Forces. At the center of the coalitions is a U.S.-sponsored framework to
enable partners to contribute to international security.

President Barack Obama intends to continue the American tradition of
enabling partners throughout the globe. As he noted in his second
inaugural address, "America will remain the anchor of strong alliances
in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that
extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. For no one has a greater
stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation." [By training
and equipping other militaries, the goal is to **reduce** U.S. American
**military presence internationally** and]{.underline} allow others to
provide for their own security. [This has **positive
benefits**]{.underline} not only for the U.S. defense budget (e.g., an
Afghan soldier costs hundreds per month compared to an American soldier
who costs thousands per month), but also [for **international
security**]{.underline}. While my earlier book Exporting Security
explains why the United States assists governments from Afghanistan to
Zambia, an overlooked area is security assistance provided to developed
countries.

CAPACITY MATTERS

As France recently learned in Mali, while it has capable ground forces
and aircraft, it has limited ability to sustain these forces just 2,000
miles from home. To support its foreign policy agenda, France needed the
United States Air Force to fly its forces and refuel its attack
aircraft. As the operation continues, the United States will probably
provide intelligence for French and African forces as they shift to
stability operations.

Counterterrorism can certainly explain U.S. intervention in Mali;
however, enabling French success explains the timeline. More
importantly, the case of U.S.-supported French intervention in Mali is
illustrative of the role the United States plays in supporting developed
countries. France is the latest developed country to need U.S.
assistance, but requests like this are common. This is true for almost
every one of the 50 countries serving in Afghanistan today, as it was
true with European countries in the Balkans, Australian forces in East
Timor, and British forces in West Africa. These examples highlight that
the foreign policy goals of many developed countries exceed their
military capacity, which requires them to rely on the U.S. military for
assistance. As developed countries' defense budgets fall further,
reliance on the United States is going to increase. This remains a
decades-old frustration. Most recently, the NATO Secretary General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, "There is a lower limit on how little we can
spend on defense, while living up to our responsibilities.\"7

Pragmatically, the United States would like its partners to do more, but
shared challenges and limited budgets will reinforce the value of
American logistics, combat experience, and intelligence capacity.
Further, American support of other countries reinforces the treaty
arrangements with 27 NATO countries and five Asian countries. Twenty
years ago, there seemed to be little relevance to these treaties and
security arrangements, let alone a rationale for invoking them or
expanding them. Yet, the opposite occurred. NATO increased its
membership three times from 16 to 19 in 1999, again to 26 in 2006, and
again to 28 in 2009. At the same time the number of NATO members
increased, NATO changed from its traditional mission of territorial
defense to one of global security engagement. With each expansion, new
members require training and equipping to NATO standards. With each new
operation, NATO countries require access to U.S. intelligence, critical
technology, and global logistics.

In addition to formal treaties of alliance, an additional dozen
countries are offered protection under the U.S. security umbrella either
by law, such as the Taiwan Relations Act or by policy such as United
States' support for Israel.8 These protections include provisions to
train and equip their militaries. Another dozen countries are offered
special security provisions through Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status.
MNNA does not confer a mutual defense relationship, but the largely
symbolic act implies a close working relationship with another
country\'s defense forces.9 It is more akin to a preferred buyer's
program allowing countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea access
to advanced weapons systems. With weapons purchases also come long-term
training and maintenance contracts. From a U.S. perspective, it has a
comparative advantage in defense exports; strategically, programs like
these are intended to overcome the free-rider problem the United States
faces with its partners.10 For every Joint Strike Fighter Japan buys,
the United States can deploy one less to northeast Asia.

Given the diplomatic nature of these security partnerships, the
Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs focuses these
activities, regulates the defense trade and arms transfers to reinforce
the military capabilities of friends, allies, and coalition partners,
and ensures that the transfer of U.S.-origin defense equipment and
technology supports U.S. national security interests. Further, the
Bureau promotes regional security through bilateral and multilateral
cooperation and dialogue, as well as through the provision of security
assistance to friendly countries and international peacekeeping efforts.
The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military balances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to Saudi
Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., South Korea), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old FARC insurgency). Historically, Israel has been
the largest recipient of security assistance and its neighbor Egypt
benefited from its recognition of Israel and the Camp David Accords.11
Given its proximity to the United States and challenges with drug
trafficking organizations, Mexico has recently emerged as a top
recipient of security assistance. Given the history of American military
interventions in Mexico, this has required new efforts to build trust to
reassure the government that it seeks to strengthen it and not undermine
it.12

One reason the United States concentrates assistance on just a few
countries is to promote particular countries as regional leaders. In
practice, this means that Jordan hosts an international special
operations exercise, peace operations training center, and an
international police training center. Or in Latin America, Colombia
provides helicopter training for regional militaries and El Salvador
hosts a regional peacekeeping institute, attracting military personnel
from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Given the significant
U.S. investment in Afghanistan's military and police training
infrastructure, it is likely that Afghanistan could eventually host
regional training if the insurgency subsides to acceptable levels. [This
approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also **reduces** the
need for American **presence** and the **negative attention** it
sometimes generates]{.underline}. We see the benefits of this today
where U.S.-trained Colombian pilots are training Mexican pilots in
Colombia.

**\[Table 1: Top Recipients of U.S. International Assistance (Account
150) OMITTED\]**

In addition to the Department of State budget for security assistance,
the [**Defense** Department]{.underline} directly funds security
assistance through section 1206/7 and other command funds such as
Commander's Emergency Response Program. This [**authority** did provoke
more **concern** about **militarizing fo**reign **po**licy;
**[however]{.mark}**, this **[only]{.mark}** makes up]{.underline} about
\$1 billion annually, which is [[**less than 15 percent** of]{.mark}
**security assistance** funded by the **[State]{.mark}** Department.
Further, U.S. **ambassadors must approve all programs**]{.underline}.
Thus, [the Department of **[State]{.mark} exerts considerable
[control]{.mark} of [programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels]{.mark}** through the embassy country team]{.underline}.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE MILITARY

With national security focused on weak states and persistent security
concerns among stable allies like South Korea, the U.S. military has
been changing over the last 20 years from a force of confrontation to
one of cooperation. [The military has learned that partnership is better
than clientism and is adapting its command structure once optimized for
waging major combat to one that is focused on conflict prevention. There
is **still a tremendous warfighting capability** in the U.S. military,
but coalition warfare is the norm and developing compatible warfighting
partners is a key goal of this cooperative strategy]{.underline}. In
some sense, [[this **turns the idea of militarization**]{.mark} **of
fo**reign **po**licy **[on its head]{.mark}**; the [Pentagon is **being
demilitarized**]{.mark} and valued for its ability to impart military
capabilities to U.S. partners]{.underline}.

Given the current structure of the international system and
technological advances, the United States does not need partners in the
same way as it did in the past where they provided direct benefits
through coaling stations, maintenance facilities, or large bases. While
the number of forward bases is still substantial, the number of forward
deployed forces are greatly reduced. More importantly, the nature of the
presence has changed; the United States aspires to create true partners
that can confront their own threats to internal stability (e.g.,
assistance to Colombia's military) or alleviate security dilemmas (e.g.,
future basing in Australia). It also seeks to foster independence by
training and equipping militaries to support the global demand for
peacekeepers.14 The United States certainly gets increased access to
countries around the world through these programs, but given the
overwhelming military dominance of the United States, it does not abuse
these relationships or ignore seemingly insignificant states. Instead,
it seeks to create partners where sovereignty is respected and all
parties derive benefits. The latest example of this is U.S. withdrawal
from Iraq as dictated by a U.S.-Iraqi agreement.

[[While]{.mark} the Defense Department's capacity certainly explains why
international [assistance]{.mark} missions **[increasingly have a
military face]{.mark}**, it is also essential to understand that **there
is a global demand** for U.S. security assistance. The
**[Defense]{.mark}** Department **[has recognized]{.mark} that there are
[limits]{.mark} to what it can do**; the military **[wants]{.mark}** and
needs [**partners** from **across**]{.mark} the **[government]{.mark}**,
[**allies** and **private**]{.mark} **organization[s]{.mark}**.
Unfortunately, these ideas remain]{.underline} stunted
[\[**[overlooked]{.mark}**\] [in the]{.mark} broader foreign [policy

/GoGreen!

[Much has been written on the "militarization" of US foreign
policy]{.underline}. Since 9/11, [the Department of Defense expanded its
non-combat activities into areas normally reserved for traditional
diplomacy]{.underline}. In 2005, it was given a mandate to build
"indigenous capacity for securing essential services, a viable market
economy, rule of law, democratic institutions, and a robust civil
society". While the initial focus was on Iraq and Afghanistan, it
allowed the Department to do the same in other regions.

In 2009, the Department's international mandate broadened to
"strengthening governance and the rule of law and fostering economic
stability and development". Congress added new authorities, most
recently allowing the US military to work with non-military security
forces. The Defense Department now manages a greater portion of security
assistance than the Department of State. The Trump Administration
continues to favor the use of the US military over US diplomacy to
address great-power competition. It has increased the defense budget
while slashing that for diplomacy; for 2020, it requested a 4.9%
increase for the Defense Department and proposed a 21% cut for the State
Department. Today, the Department of Defense plays an important role in
US foreign policy.

This expanded role is visible in Europe. Despite tirades by President
Donald Trump on the value of NATO, and finger-pointing on member
contributions, [US military engagement with NATO]{.underline} and in
Europe [continues]{.underline}, with broad Congressional and public
support. Through the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), [the US
military has increased its forward presence and exercises with allies
and partners]{.underline}. Through Operation Atlantic Resolve, the US
European Command added US troop rotations across Eastern Europe and
prepositioned equipment. The Defense Department also [boosted training
and assistance]{.underline} for Georgia and Ukraine. The increased US
military presence in Europe was triggered by Russia's invasion of Crimea
and aimed at reassuring allies along Europe's eastern frontier. Today,
it is part of a broader US and NATO deterrence posture vis-à-vis Russia.

The Defense Department has become involved in institution-building in
the region, normally the purview of diplomacy. Examples include
repairing schools, conducting anti-corruption workshops, and law
enforcement training. The gray zone challenges in Europe, especially
cyber and disinformation, are being addressed primarily by the Defense
Department. Whereas the State Department eliminated the office of the
Cyber Coordinator, the Defense Department broadened its networks and now
includes civilian authorities in exercises. [Whereas the State
Department has very little funding to fight Russian disinformation, the
Defense Department is expanding initiatives within EUCOM and [with
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The consequences of the increased militarization of US foreign policy
for transatlantic relations are threefold.

First, [US engagement in Europe appears more militarized]{.underline}.
The addition of US forces and the increased tempo of exercises has meant
that tens of thousands of US troops have moved across Europe visible to
all civilians. A publicity campaign has been waged to highlight this
commitment. New security agreements are being signed and celebrated,
including the new letter on security cooperation between the US, Finland
and Sweden. The increased US pressure on burden sharing, although not
always well received, has meant even more defense discussions.

[In contrast, US diplomatic engagement has decreased]{.underline}.
President Trump's negative rhetoric about Europe, the decision to
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran Nuclear Agreement
(JCPOA), and friction on issues such as Nord Stream II have disrupted
normal diplomatic discourse. There have been no US-EU Summits since
President Trump took office and subgroups on energy and cyber have not
met in several years.

Secondly, [joint **[efforts to address]{.mark} threats to
[democracy]{.mark}** in the region **[will likely be carried
out]{.mark}** or funded [by]{.mark} the **[Defense]{.mark}** Department.
The State Department simply does not have the resources]{.underline}:
for 2018, its budget for all of Europe and Eurasia was \$1.2 billion.
The budget for EDI alone was \$4.5 billion.

Thirdly, beyond Europe, [**US-European [coop]{.mark}eration** [is **more
likely** to advance in **military rather than**]{.mark} **in [policy
channels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On China, for example, where
policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic are unable to agree on a
comprehensive approach, defense officials are working together to
address China's new military muscle in forums such as the US France
Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue. In Africa, where US and EU policymakers
have vastly different strategies, military cooperation continues to
fight terrorism, crime and human trafficking.

[The enhanced position of the Defense Department in US foreign policy is
likely to continue]{.underline}. The US military has not sought this
role. Indeed, US military leaders have repeatedly called for restoring
balance between the use of military and diplomatic tools and for funding
the State Department. Despite these appeals, the Trump Administration's
preference for using the US military will further increase the
militarization of US foreign policy.

[For Europe, **leveraging defense ties** can help **balance diplomatic
disconnects** across the transatlantic]{.underline}. While there are
challenges in defense policy, [**[defense relations]{.mark}** may
[prove]{.mark} to be [the **steadier foundation for transatlantic
coop**]{.mark}**eration** in the near future]{.underline}.

The Price of Unity

Admittedly, [pursuing a tougher course of action on values and
principles comes with risks]{.underline}. [**[Even measured
steps]{.mark}** could **[create serious rifts]{.mark}** among allies,
with the potential of]{.underline} paralyzing **[\[[freezing]{.mark}\]
[the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Because NATO operates by
consensus, any punitive action on an ally could provoke retaliatory
action on other NATO business. In reaction to Norway's stark criticisms
against the Portuguese and Greek regimes at a June 1971 foreign
ministers meeting, then-NATO Secretary General Manlio Brosio warned that
"if we undermine our solidarity, we run the risk of undermining the
substance of our alliance."

Overcoming this dilemma between prioritizing values and preserving unity
requires a graduated, collective, and dispassionate approach. First,
NATO will need to be proportionate when dealing with an ally violating
trans-Atlantic values. Allies should start with discussions behind
closed doors rather than publicize the dispute. Open and frank dialogue
among allies should always be the first step before adopting restrictive
measures. [[If]{.mark} NATO [moves **too quickly**]{.mark} **or
aggressively**, it risks being [**counterproductive** by **widening
divisions**]{.mark} in the alliance]{.underline}. At the end of the day,
this progressive approach should have a deterrent effect on NATO
countries, especially on those that value their membership in the
alliance and do not want to be singled out as "bad allies."

Second, NATO's response should be as collective and resolute as
possible. [**[If pressure is applied by only a few]{.mark} NATO
[countries]{.mark}**, [the ally]{.mark} in question may **[not
take]{.mark} the warning [seriously]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} could
**[use]{.mark} the [divisions]{.mark} among allies [to avoid
accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If enough allies agree to lean on
a problematic NATO country, then accepting short-term disunity for the
sake of preserving trans-Atlantic values could be worth it. In 2019,
Turkey ultimately decided to lift its longstanding veto to the defense
plans of Poland and the Baltic states because it was facing a growing
and consistent pressure from numerous allies, including the United
States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The unity of the
members of the Quad was critical in that case and changed Ankara's
strategic calculus.

Last but not least, all allies must be subject to the same objective
criteria and scrutiny. Otherwise, [the backsliding ally [will]{.mark}
simply [**claim it is being singled out** and **dismiss**]{.mark} **the
charges**]{.underline}. The International Secretariat can be helpful
here by conducting an impartial, evenhanded assessment. Strong
involvement of NATO's secretary general will also be key in preserving
political cohesion through this thorny process. Recently, Secretary
General Stoltenberg played an instrumental role in easing the tensions
between Greece and Turkey through the establishment of a bilateral
de-confliction mechanism in which he did not assess blame but merely
facilitated dialogue to be informed by international rules and norms.

There are many good reasons to host such a gathering. It's smart
politics, fulfills a campaign commitment and counters the perception,
fostered by President Donald Trump, that America is no longer interested
in promoting democracy and human rights. But as a geopolitical
instrument, [**drawing lines between democracies and autocracies** is
not only **certain to disappoint** --- it's also a deeply flawed
organizing principle for America's approach to the world]{.underline}.

China and Russia, which Biden has also singled out for criticism, are
not the main causes of the weakening of democracies around the world.
Most of the backsliding, according to a recent study, has been caused by
erosion within the world's democracies, including the United States and
many of its allies. Indeed, the upcoming summit includes a number of
countries --- India, Brazil, the Philippines and Poland among them ---
marked by growing autocratic movements and infringements on freedom of
expression and a free press. And **[[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these and [**[other countries to reform]{.mark}** their political,
electoral or judicial institutions [**from the outside** is]{.mark} hard
if not **[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Biden isn't the first and won't be the last American president to make
democracy promotion central to his foreign policy. Woodrow Wilson wanted
to make the world "safe for democracy"; Franklin Roosevelt promulgated
the Atlantic Charter. The Clinton administration was present at the
creation of the Community of Democracies. George W. Bush had his Freedom
Agenda and talked about ridding the world of dictators. All found
democracy promotion a useful tool to advance U.S. values and interests.

Biden seems to genuinely believe that democrats and dictators are in a
do-or-die battle over who will own the 21st century. Though he insists
that he doesn't want a new cold war, some of his overcharged rhetoric
belies this view. In March, Biden announced his intention "to invite an
alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future," including
holding "China accountable to follow the rules" on issues such as
persecution of its Uyghur citizens and its territorial disputes with
Taiwan. Biden has said of China's President Xi Jinping that he "doesn't
have a democratic bone . . . in his body" and that Xi believes
"democracy cannot keep up with" China.

It is simplistic to believe, however, that Chinese and Russian foreign
policies are driven by the ideological impulse to spread autocracy. Both
countries see the United States as their main geopolitical adversary and
seek to undermine American influence and alliances wherever they can;
the Chinese are also bent on outcompeting the United States in
21st-century technologies.

But the Russians don't have an authoritarian model for export, and other
autocratic-minded governments don't need inspiration from Moscow to run
kleptocratic, corrupt, repressive and misgoverned regimes. Putin's
overriding priority is self-preservation and the preservation of his
regime. What evidence is there that he believes these objectives can be
achieved only if the rest of the world looks like Russia?

Likewise, Xi's main priority is maintaining his control and the Chinese
Communist Party's monopoly on power. He is all too happy to claim that
the Chinese government is outperforming America's dysfunctional system.
But it is simply not the case that he thinks these goals require Beijing
to actively spread authoritarianism with Chinese characteristics abroad.
And China's wealth and power, not to mention its social stability,
depend on competing effectively within the interdependent global
economic system, not toppling it.

[[Another **flaw**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Biden administration's
approach [[is the **presumption that all democracies think
alike**]{.mark} based on their shared commitment to democratic
values]{.underline}. If only it were that simple. [Values do shape a
nation's foreign policy, but history, geography, culture, political
ideology and material interests also matter]{.underline}. [It is
[**precisely for these reasons** that]{.mark} America's **[democratic
allies]{.mark}** and partners **[do not see eye to eye]{.mark}** on how
to deal with China or Russia --- and why they shouldn't be forced to
choose sides between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
the authoritarians]{.underline}.

rights, the United States continued to experience erosion in democratic
practices in 2020;over the past decade, America's score dropped from 94
to 83 out of 100, among the steepest falls of any country during this

Ch. 3\]

This finding or 'law' has not only been recognized by scholars of
international relations, but also found its way outside academia and has
influenced foreign policies to promote peace and democracy, most
prominently since the 1990s. However, [my book will not]{.underline}
draw conclusions based on '**[cherry-pick]{.underline}**ing' of specific
studies showing how peaceful democracies are, but on a systematic
overview of studies in this field. Therefore, [this book relies on **my
own database** with **[hundreds of]{.mark} different
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are relevant for each chapter;
the articles had to engage directly with the chapter's main research
question. The next section will provide more detailed information around
the selection criteria. This overview includes both highly cited and
recent articles which were selected in a systematic way.

Based on analyses of statistical studies around this topic of democracy
and war, it will become clear that the overall statistical support for
the democratic peace hypothesis is not strong at all. In the rest of the
chapter, I will spell out four reasons why [democracy does **not cause
peace**]{.underline}, and why [the **empirical [support]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} the popular idea of [democratic [peace]{.mark} is
**quite [weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}: (1) most [studies do [no]{.mark}t
find a **strong [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between democracy
and interstate war [[at]{.mark} the **[dyadic
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [they show that there are
**other---more powerful---explanations** for war and peace, or even that
the impact of democracy is a **spurious one**]{.underline}, (2) [the
**theoretical foundation** of the democratic peace hypothesis is
**weak**, and the causal mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}, (3)
[democracies are **not necessarily more peaceful**]{.underline} in
general, [and the [evidence]{.mark} for the democratic peace hypothesis
[at the **monadic level** is inconclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}, and (4)
the process of democratization is dangerous and living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country.

In my view, [it is]{.underline} difficult---if not
**[impossible]{.underline}**---[to support the democratic peace
hypothesis]{.underline} without any reservations. The key caveats should
not be ignored and certainly deserve more attention before we can
confidently argue that democracies are more peaceful than other types of
political systems. Please notice that I can already reveal that the
assumed link between democracy and intrastate war is problematic as
well, but this topic will be at the core of the next chapter (Chapter
4).

Selection of Articles: Democracy and War

The instrumental value of democracy cannot convincingly be found in
democracy's expected bond with peace. I have come to this conclusion on
the basis of an analysis of statistical studies, which will be discussed
in the rest of this chapter. So how did I select the articles for my
database?4

For this chapter and Chapter 4, I selected the articles that focused on
war and democracy. Using the online database Web of Science (formerly
known as Web of Knowledge), [I identified]{.underline} a total of almost
**[[8000 articles]{.underline}]{.mark}** published in the sampled
journals until the end of 2015. I identifed them by entering 'democr\*'
in the basic search field; this asterisk (\*)-based 'wildcard' allows
searching for terms including 'democratic', 'democracy', and
'democratization' (in both British and American spellings)
simultaneously, in the title, abstract and/or the keywords. As a next
step, I excluded articles in which 'democracy' is used as synonym for
state (e.g. analysis of the relationship between immigration policies
and unemployment in European democracies) or a specific political party
or movement (e.g. the 'Democrats' in the USA, or Uganda's People's
Democratic Army) or a specifc country (e.g. the Democratic Republic of
Congo). In addition, I identified them by entering 'war\*' in the basic
search feld. The words democracy (democr\*) and war (war\*) need to be
mentioned in title and/or abstract---and I also checked for equivalents
of 'war' like 'conflict' and 'dispute' and 'no peace'.5

As it is not feasible to analyse thousands of articles, it is necessary
to take a next step in the selection process. I decided to select these
articles, which will be part of the database for the third and fourth
chapter, in three different ways. The first method is to choose the
articles with the most citations. So, for example, in Chapter 3, the
articles which are cited more than a hundred times are included in this
first list. The article by Beck et al. (1998) has been cited more than
951 times, and as a consequence, this article is part of the database.
But also articles with a much lower number of citations (such as
Barbieri 1996, with 179 citations) are included in my analyses.

The second method is simply to include the most recent articles
published in the past five years, so since beginning 2011 until end
2015. The most recent articles can easily be overlooked by applying the
first method of most quoted articles. In my view, however, they still
need to be included as they present the most recent findings and engage
with the recent and innovative debates, which cannot be ignored in this
book. For example, recent studies on democracy and interstate war
(Chapter 3) have paid more attention to the mechanisms (see, e.g.,
Zeigler et al. 2014), and there is a growing attention for the impact of
political institutions in recent studies on democracy and intrastate war
(Chapter 4; see, e.g., Walter 2015). Those recent findings cannot be
ignored in any systematic analysis of statistical studies on this theme.

The third method is the most subjective approach of selecting articles,
as it is based on the 'snowballing method'. So it includes articles
which have not been selected by the first and second methods, but which
have been quoted extensively and regularly by the previously selected
articles. For example, the article by Bethany Lacina (2006) cannot be
selected based on having high citations (the first method) and it cannot
be included based on being a recent publication (the second method), but
it has been mentioned by key studies and hence surfaces via the
snowballing method (a third method). This article is important as it
**[clearly [distinguish]{.mark}]{.underline}**es [the]{.underline}
determinants of [**[conflict severity]{.mark}** from]{.underline} those
for **[conflict onset]{.underline}**, and [those [determinants
seem]{.mark} to be **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is
crucial information for Chapter 4.

In this way, my study presents and assesses the findings based on a big
pool of statistical studies in the published literature. Based on this
assessment, I will be able to draw clearer conclusions concerning the
significance of the effects of democracy on interstate war (this
chapter) and intrastate war (the next chapter). The Appendix shows more
detailed information of the selected articles.

The Democratic Peace Hypothesis, Its Roots and Supporters

The democratic peace hypothesis6 states that democracies never or seldom
go to war with one another. Where is this powerful idea of 'democratic
peace' coming from? Before discussing the main findings of the
statistical articles and before describing the four caveats of the
'democratic peace paradigm', we need to know a bit more around the
background and the roots of this idea.

Immanuel Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace has often been mentioned as
the foundation for this hypothesis. Kant believed peace was difficult to
achieve, since 'the natural state is one of war' (Kant 1795: 10). A
state of peace must therefore be established for---in his view---it is
certain that hostilities will be committed and people need to be
protected from each other. In such a world, each may treat his
neighbour, from whom he demands security, as an enemy. In a dictatorship
where 'the subjects are not citizens, a declaration of war is the
easiest thing in the world to decide upon, because war does not require
of the ruler, who is the proprietor and not a member of the state, the
least sacrifice of the pleasures of his table, the chase, his country
houses, his court functions, and the like. He may, therefore, resolve on
war as on a pleasure party for the most trivial reasons, and with
perfect indifference leave the justification which decency requires to
the diplomatic corps who are ever ready to provide it' (Kant 1795: 13).

In contrast, the situation is different in constitutional republics,
according to Kant. He argued that the majority of the people in
republics would never vote to go to war, except for pure self-defence.
Therefore, a world with only republics would be peaceful, since there
would be no aggressors. The republican constitution, which requires the
consent of the citizens to start a war, gives the positive prospect of
perpetual peace.

It is important to note that the ideas of Kant on the one hand and the
modern democratic peace scholars on the other hand are not completely
similar. For example, Kant talked about republics instead of democratic
states as the ideal states to achieve peace. He defined republican
states as states with representative governments, in which the
legislature is separated from the executive. Not
surprisingly---considering the epoch in which he lived---Kant did not
include universal suffrage in his definition, which is now seen as an
essential dimension of democracy, even of the most minimalist types of
democracy (Dahl 1971; see also Chapter 2). Moreover, Kant argued that
republics will be at peace in general, which means that such political
systems are expected to be not only in peace with each other, but also
with other non-republican systems. Nowadays, [**only few scholars**
would support]{.underline} this approach of [a '**monadic democratic
peace**']{.underline}. As will become clear at the end of this chapter,
[there is **[no]{.mark}t much [evidence]{.mark}** for the idea that
[democracies are **more peaceful in general**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the 1960s, most statistical studies have not focused on the
'monadic democratic peace hypothesis' but on testing the 'dyadic
democratic peace hypothesis'. This dyadic hypothesis states that it is
less likely that democracies fight with each other, compared to other
'dyads' or other pairs of different types of political systems. The
sociologist Dean Babst was the first scholar who started to build on
Kant's old idea in the 'dyadic' way, and decided to test it in
statistical studies (Babst 1964, 1972). He concluded that 'no wars have
been fought between independent nations with elective governments
between 1789 and 1941' (Babst 1972: 55). His study was not published in
one of the journals in the field of international relations, but in a
sociological journal and later in Industrial Research. Therefore, it was
not read by international relations scholars, and initially, it did not
get the attention it deserved in the field of international politics.

Babst's work was, for example, not cited by Melvin Small and J. David
Singer (1976), and their fndings seemed to contradict Babst's study.
However, Small and Singer did not compare the rates of war proneness for
democracies and dictatorships, but instead they focused on the question
whether wars involving democratic states have historically been
significantly different in length or in degree of violence compared to
wars involving only dictatorships. For length and degree of violence
during the wars, they did not find a difference between democracies and
dictatorships, so they concluded that types of political systems did not
matter.7 A few years later, Rudolph J. Rummel did cite Babst's work and
replicated Babst's idea in statistical tests, which were described in
the fourth book of his five-volume Understanding Confict and War (1975--
1981). He found clear support for his eleventh (of the 33) propositions
about causes and conditions of conflict, which stated that 'Libertarian
systems mutually preclude violence' (Rummel 1979: 279).

Eventually, those innovative studies from the 1970s helped to evoke the
interest in the democratic peace proposition, and in the expected
peaceful nature of relationships among democratic states. Since the
1980s, the number of quantitative studies has increased considerably,
accumulating into an impressive field of research in international
relations with its own 'empirical law' of democratic peace (Levy 1989:
270; see also Ray 1998).

This democratic peace hypothesis has not only received support from
political scientists, but also from politicians and policy makers.
Particularly since 1993, the idea of a democratic peace has inspired
American foreign policies aimed at the promotion of peace and democracy.
As the 42nd president of the USA (1993--2001), Bill Clinton was the
first politician who explicitly bridged the gap between these findings
in international relations on the one hand, and his foreign policy
strategy on the other hand, at least rhetorically. Anthony Lake, who was
Clinton's National Security Adviser, stated in 1993 that in order to
cope with America's foreign policy challenges, the expansion of
democratic states around the world would be essential because 'it
protects our \[U.S.\] interests and security' (see Henderson 2002: 20).
In his 1994 State of the Union, Clinton declared that 'Ultimately, the
best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack
each other'.8 Findings from research in the field of international
relations seemed to have a direct impact on policy making, and this move
of the Clinton administration can be seen as 'a textbook case of
arbitrage between the ivory tower and the real world' (Gowa 1999: 109).

Clinton's successor, George W. Bush, went one big step further in his
faith that democratic peace holds. He argued that efforts to turn Iraq
into a democratic country would have positive effects on Iraqi's
neighbours. The authoritarian regimes in the region would fall as domino
stones and follow the Iraqi example. They would start democratizing as
soon as they could, which would then result in achieving a peaceful and
stable the Middle East. The real motives for attacking Iraq may have
been different, but 'regime change' was at the heart of Washington's
rhetoric when the USA started to bomb Baghdad in March 2003. The
rhetoric of the Bush administration focused on toppling Saddam Hussein's
regime, and replacing the entire underlying dictatorial system with a
democracy.

Moreover, George W. Bush used the democratic peace idea to justify the
war in Iraq, declaring, 'The reason why I'm so strong on democracy is
democracies don't go to war with each other...I've got great faith in
democracies to promote peace. And that's why I'm such a strong believer
that the way forward in the Middle East, the broader Middle East, is to
promote democracy'.9 In 2004, the 43rd President of the USA said: 'If
you think you can have peace without democracy -- again - I think you'll
find that - I can only speak for myself, that I will be extremely
doubtful that it will ever happen'.10 In his second inaugural address,
he stated that 'the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends
on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world'.

Again, these are just words from speeches and can hence be seen as
rhetoric to defend military intervention (cf. Jervis 2003; Kaufmann
2004; Daalder and Lindsay 2005; Owen 2005; Lieberfeld 2005; Schmidt and
Williams 2008). Still, in the end, politicians have rationalized their
political decisions based on one of the most powerful ideas taken from
studies in the field of international relations, clearly showing the
influence of this academic idea in political practice.

Hence, the field of international relations seems to have its own law:
democracies rarely fight with each other. It cannot be denied that the
evidence supporting the democratic peace proposition is quite diverse in
character (see Ray 1998): the evidence has been epistemological (Rummel
1975), philosophical (Doyle 1986), formal (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
1992), historical (Weart 1994; Ray 1995; Owen 1994), experimental (Mintz
and Geva 1993), anthropological (Ember et al. 1992; Crawford 1994),
psychological (Kegley and Hermann 1995), economic (Brawley 1993; Weede
1996) and political (Gaubatz 1991). Still, there have been numerous
critical studies (see, i.e., Hayes 2011), and the general picture is
unclear. We do not yet know much about the overall findings from
statistical studies.

So far, it seems as if some quantitative studies---mainly within the
field of international relations---have found strong and robust evidence
which supports the 'democratic peace hypothesis'. Those studies show
that democracy has had a positive influence on international peace (see,
i.e., Rummel 1979; Ray and Russett 1996). In this sense, the idea of a
democratic peace seems to be confirmed. Political scientists such as
James Lee Ray are passionate supporters: 'No scientific evidence is
entirely definitive' but 'based on all the empirical evidence so far'
the more defensible of the two possible definitive answers to the
question "Does democracy cause peace?" is "Yes" (Ray 1998: 43). However,
based on my own analyses of the empirical studies with statistical
evidence, I cannot be as enthusiastic as those scholars; to the
contrary, I whole-heartily disagree with them, as a more systematic
analysis of the articles shows that there are four important weaknesses,
which seriously undermines the idea that peace is one of democracy's
instrumental values.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

While analysing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms (see next section, caveat 2), and hence seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this way, the
majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the idea
that democratic peace actually exists without testing this proposition.
However, **[no]{.underline}**ne of the [**studies** that **directly
test** the democratic peace]{.underline} hypothesis [found **strong
evidence** that democracy is the **most important factor** when
explaining interstate war]{.underline}. All democratic peace studies
have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace, such
as [economic development and growth, geographic distance and contiguity,
power status, alliance ties, militarization and political
stability]{.underline}. The findings show that it is not just democracy
which explains war, not at all. Within this group of studies, which
explicitly test the democratic peace hypothesis, four different types of
findings can be detected. I will discuss those results more in-depth in
the rest of this section.

First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Significant Too

The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically significant as well (Maoz and Russett
1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck et al. 1998;
Ray 2013). For example, some studies (e.g. Rousseau et al. 1996)
included alternative independent variables in order to test realist
arguments. They tested whether the distribution of power determines
decisions to use force, and measures each state's military capabilities
relative to its opponent. A state's military capability is the average
of three elements: number of troops, military expenditures and military
expenditures per soldier. They found that this realist variable was
strong, positive and statistically significant at the 0.001 level in
their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However,
not only a state's military capabilities appeared to be an important
explanation for peace. In addition, wealth, growth, alliances and
contiguity played a crucial role when explaining interstate war (see,
e.g., Maoz and Russett 1993: 632, Table 1).11 Moreover, [[when]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** are [included]{.mark}, the **impact of
[democracy]{.mark}** on the likelihood of international crises
[is]{.mark} **even [spurious]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett
1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141, see also p. 3).12 Still, scholars in
this group keep defending the democratic peace idea, despite the fact
that their own analyses showed the significance of alternative
explanations.

Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models

The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau 2013; Gartzke
and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate the spuriousness
of the statistical democratic peace pointed to [other
factors]{.underline} that, [when accounted for '**properly'**,
**eliminated**]{.underline} or dramatically reduced [the statistical
significance of shared democracy]{.underline}. Hence, the studies in
this second group did not find strong evidence for the democratic peace
hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were included in the
models.14

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that [there is **no democratic peace**, but a **capitalist
peace instead**]{.underline}. The settlement in Germany and Japan
succeeded because of the establishment of capitalist peace. Because of
economic support by the Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered
trade opportunities in practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe
and Japan would gain economically, resulting in 'economic growth,
prosperity, and, ultimately, free trade among most of the more
technologically advanced economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By
establishing and expanding free trade, the incentives for war would
quickly decrease among trading states, according to this approach. To
prevent new interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was
a far more important factor than the American promotion of democracy and
its political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014).
[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [peace]{.mark} **only [exists]{.mark}** [when
both]{.mark} democracies [have **high**]{.mark} **levels of economic
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when economic development is well
above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and **[the
[poorest]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4--5% of current [[**democracies**,
are]{.mark} **significantly [more likely]{.mark}** than other kinds of
political systems [to **fight each other**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Mousseau 2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies
involved has a very low level of economic development, then democracy
cannot prevent war.16 Still, there is a pacifying effect of [free trade
and economic interdependence]{.underline}, which [is **more important**
than the effect of democracy]{.underline}, because the former affects
peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development
and ultimately, democracy (see Weede 2004).17

Capitalist peace is not the only alternative explanation. Shared
interests in general, and political similarities in specific, can also
be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and peace
between countries (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997; Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999;
Henderson 2002). [Democracies are **not peaceful** to each other because
they are **democratic**, but rather because they are
**similar**]{.underline}. So the difference of the scores of both
countries also contributes to the conflict proneness of the dyad. If the
difference in levels of democracy is big, then the chance of conflict is
higher (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it difficult to distinguish
between the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the first scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefits of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger

This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for peace
(and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies in
the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically significant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war (Bremer 1992; Gelpi
1997; Oneal and Russett 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002; Peterson 2013;
Caselli et al. 2015).

Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that [democracy is
**not the most important factor**]{.underline}, while war is more likely
to occur between states that are geographically proximate, approximately
equal in power, major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly
militarized than between those that are not. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, [multivariate analyses revealed some
differences]{.underline}. Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that
some factors are far more important than others. [The existence of a
**dangerous, [war]{.mark}-prone dyad** can be **[best explained
by]{.mark}** the **presence of [contiguity]{.mark}**, the **absence of
an [alliance]{.mark}** and the **absence of more advanced
economy**]{.underline}. The absence of democratic polity and other
factors (absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of major
power) are less powerful. Overall, these findings suggest that our
research priorities may be seriously distorted and that we should not
focus too much on the perceived positive impact of democracy, but on
other factors (such as alliances and economic factors) instead.

Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions

The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors. The chance of
democratic peace depends not just on the specific historical period
(Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons 1991;
Weede 1984), but also the stage of the conflict (beginning, duration or
severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed 2000), and on the
neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the region; see Gibler
and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013). Despite the differences
between the studies, there is one common finding in all studies: when
explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on the impact of
democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some specific historical periods. Based on
this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War. For example, Henry Farber and
Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea that peace
between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the threat from
the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another (see
also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued that most of
the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after
World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which
can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and
maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
conflict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the
benefits of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). Moreover, jointly democratic
dyads are likely to be allied only after 1945 (see Gibler and Sarkees
2004); during the 1816--1944 time period, there is even a negative
relationship between democratic dyads and alliance formation.20 These
findings cast serious doubts on the idea of a general existence of
democratic peace.

Not only the historical period, but also [the ***stage*** of the
conflict is crucial]{.underline}. Some scholars in this group provided
evidence that [democratic peace is **not universal**]{.underline}, but
that it depends on the stage and whether we focus on the beginning,
duration or severity of the conflict. Although joint democracy has some
pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results suggest that
they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to war (see Reed 2000).
Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the neighbourhood
instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues over which to
contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region. Democracies only
seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours, and therefore
they can more easily choose favourable conflicts to escalate. The type
of political system does not predict conflict selection or victory once
controls are added for issue salience (Gibler and Miller 2013; see also
Park and James 2015). There is an interaction between joint democracy
and regional instability, which confirms the idea that the effects of
type of political system on continued conflict apply mostly to dyads in
peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see also Park and James
2015). [**Very democratic countries** might]{.underline} even [become
**more aggressive** and **faster** than other political systems, once
the **region** becomes more hostile]{.underline} (see, e.g., Baliga et
al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries (Table 3.1).

Caveat 2: What Are the Causal Mechanisms?

Most of the statistical studies on democratic peace seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war; based on this
assumption, they then decide to focus on the mechanisms. This is
problematic as none of the democratic peace studies found strong
evidence that democracy is the most important factor when explaining
interstate war (see the previous section). As a consequence, the next
step of looking for mechanisms is quite irrelevant and not necessary in
my view, but most studies nevertheless argue that the field lacks strong
theoretical foundations and robust empirical evidence that can reveal
convincing causal mechanisms.22 Those studies seem to accept the
correlation between dyadic democracy and peace, and then start
questioning whether democracy really causes peace before investigating
potential mechanisms.

VI\. THE INTERLOCKING CRISES

In this Part, we highlight how the vulnerabilities of democracy are made
salient as well as exacerbated by climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene. We also emphasize how [**climate change** and **other
problems** of the Anthropocene place **democracies** that attempt to
navigate them in a **particularly impervious Scylla and Charybdis**-like
situation]{.underline}.173 [The Scylla is **ineffective policy**; the
Charybdis is some **relaxation of** the core democratic principle of
**popular sovereignty**. Both options seem nearly **guaranteed** to
trigger **significant legitimacy challenges** to **liberal democratic
systems**]{.underline}.

Traditionally, two important sources of democratic legitimacy have been
beneficial consequences, in the utilitarian tradition, and consent, in
the social contract tradition.174 Whatever else may count as beneficial
consequences, the capacity to solve problems that threaten the physical
and social security of citizens is a central and important source of
democratic legitimacy.175 Call this the "public utility" view of
democratic legitimacy. And whatever else may count as consent, surely
the fact that the majority of citizens have expressed their preference
for a certain candidate, law, or policy is an important source of
democratic legitimacy as well.176 Call this the "expressed preference"
view of democratic legitimacy.

Consider public utility first. As we have pointed out, most
[contemporary **democracies** have]{.underline} thus far [**failed** to
address]{.underline} the **[emerging problems]{.underline}** of the
Anthropocene.177 Consequently, the sense of physical and social
insecurity grows more acute amongst citizens as the problems mount and
compound.178 The legitimacy of these democracies, and the supranational
institutions they have created, such as the European Union and the
United Nations, is thus compromised on public utility grounds.

Now consider expressed preference. [[The **global scope**]{.mark},
long-term reach, unprecedented features, [and **highly complex** nature
of **climate change** and **other problems**]{.mark} of the Anthropocene
[require]{.mark} democracies to make robust commitments to
**[multilateral coop]{.mark}eration**, **[long-term planning]{.mark}**,
significant deviations from the status quo, [and]{.mark} increased
reliance on **[expert knowledge]{.mark}** if they are to succeed in
managing these problems]{.underline}. 179 Citizens' expressed
preferences may be quite distant from this network of commitments and
activities,180 since the benefits of successfully managing a problem
like climate change would mostly accrue not to these citizens, but to
spatiotemporally distant people (i.e., the global poor and future
generations) and genetically distant (non-human) nature. 181 Attempting
to force such commitments, especially at a time when democracies are
already being accused of not being responsive enough to their citizens,
can further compromise legitimacy.182

[We thus face an apparent dilemma: **[if democracies fail]{.mark}** to
successfully address climate change and other problems of the
Anthropocene, [their **legitimacy will be challenged** on **public
utility**]{.mark} grounds. **[If they aggressively]{.mark} attempt to
[address them]{.mark}**[, their **legitimacy will**]{.mark} **likely [be
challenged]{.mark}** [on **expressed preference**]{.mark} grounds.
**[Either way]{.mark}**, we can [**expect** the **power** of
**populist**]{.mark} figures and **[movements to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The remainder of this Part illuminates this dilemma by discussing how
[climate change and other problems]{.underline} of the Anthropocene
[interact [with]{.mark}]{.underline} some further **[[democratic
vulnerabilities:]{.underline}]{.mark}** weak multilateralism,
short-termism, the profusion of veto players, the contested role of
experts, and self-referring decision making.

A. **[[Weak Multilateralism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Climate change cannot be successfully managed without a strong
commitment to international cooperation.183 For a climate regime to
succeed, it must be effective, perceived as at least not unfair by all
parties, and otherwise acceptable to each party.184 At various times,
the attempt to create a regime has foundered on each of these three
considerations.185

From the beginning of the negotiations that led to the adoption of the
FCCC in 1992 and in subsequent negotiations under the Convention, the
question of fairness has been unavoidable.186 When agreements have been
structured in ways that are acceptable to developing countries (e.g.,
the Kyoto Protocol) they have been perceived as unfair by the United
States.187 This has led to the weakening of commitments and to a regime
whose effectiveness is in question.188 The Paris Agreement, by putting
voluntary pledges at the center, was designed to avoid the problem of
perceived unfairness.189 It was reasonably thought that no party could
say that they had been unfairly treated when they have agreed to be
measured in relation to a commitment that they have voluntarily
undertaken and to which no sanctions are attached for non-compliance.
190 Nevertheless, that was exactly the claim made by President Trump in
announcing his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris
Agreement.191 Moreover, the cost of creating an agreement to which no
one could reasonably object was to create an Agreement whose
effectiveness was in question even before the United States announced
its intention to withdraw.192

While climate change is its own "full tragedy and weird comedy," 193
there are structural issues at work.194 As the world order attempts to
adjust to shifting power distributions following the emergence of new
giants such as China and India, when it comes to problems such as
climate change the cooperation of such countries is no longer just
desirable but essential.195 As their collaboration becomes more
valuable, the price for obtaining it rises accordingly.196 This
complicates negotiations, and the problem seems only destined to worsen
because this logic applies not only to presently emerging world powers,
but also to those that have already emerged and those that will emerge
in the future. As we observed in an earlier paper, "\[g\]lobal
governance in the Anthropocene is cooperation-hungry, and this increases
the price of obtaining cooperation from every country."197

In addition, [**democracies** have their own **particular problems**
when it comes to **multilateral agreements**. Except in the rare case
where they are able to steer multilateral agreements in the way they
prefer, democratic governments "[often **seek to avoid
compliance**]{.mark} with binding **multilateral decisions** if [this
**weakens their relationship to their
electorate**]{.mark}]{.underline}."198 [This is in fact what happened in
the case of]{.underline} President [Trump's repudiation of the Paris
Agreement]{.underline}.199 The stated reason was the agreement's
unfairness to the United States.200 However, the deeper reason was that
the Obama administration's decision to join, although admittedly an act
of national self-determination, was not in fact an authentic deliverance
of American popular sovereignty, at least in the eyes of Trump and his
supporters.201 According to Trump,

> \[t\]he Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of
> Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United
> States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American
> workers -- who \[sic\] I love -- and taxpayers to absorb the cost in
> terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly
> diminished economic production.202

In the same speech Trump reminded his audience that "I was elected to
represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."203

In democracies, it is ultimately citizens who empower their
representatives to bargain and strike terms of international
cooperation.204 Successfully addressing the problems of the Anthropocene
is likely to require unprecedented levels of multilateralism.205
Democratic states that attempt to rise to the challenge are likely to
face legitimacy challenges on expressed preference grounds. Those that
do not may face legitimacy challenges on public utility grounds.

B. **[[Short-termism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Short-termism can be defined as "the priority given to present net
benefits at the cost of future ones."206 Short-termism is a problem
whenever policy domains have an extended timeframe, as is the case with
climate change and other systemic problems of the Anthropocene.207 In
these cases, present net benefits may need to be curtailed (through
increases in taxes and regulations, for example) for the sake of
benefits that might materialize in the distant future. These future
benefits will then mostly advantage people other than those who have
borne the costs. Reasons for privileging the present in these cases
include pure time preference, uncertainty, and diminished or even null
moral concern for those who might benefit in the future.208 The
temptation, then, is to eschew the costs of the required policies and
"pass the buck" to future generations.209

Short-termism is not always irrational nor morally wrong.210 It has been
argued, however, that short-termism is both irrational and morally wrong
in the case of climate change.211 The sources of short-termism are
rooted in human psychology and can manifest in any kind of political
regime.212 However, it has been argued that democracies are particularly
vulnerable to short-termism.213

[One important reason for the short-termism of democratic political
regimes is that these regimes inherit, via voting and other forms of
popular influence, their citizens' biases in favor of the present.
**[Policies]{.mark}** may also]{.underline} reflect [citizens'
**[misinformation]{.mark}** about, or unawareness of, long-term
processes, risks, policy aims, and possible outcomes]{.underline}.214
[[To counter]{.mark} these tendencies, liberal democracies [typically
filter]{.mark} their citizens' inter-temporal biases, misinformation,
and unawareness [through]{.mark} such mechanisms as constitutions and
reliance on **[expert bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.215 [[Yet the **more
filtering**]{.mark} they do, [the **more likely**]{.mark} they
[are]{.mark} to incur **[legitimacy challenges]{.mark}** on expressed
preference grounds]{.underline}.216 This is a problem of
intra-generational legitimacy.217

There are also problems of inter-generational legitimacy.218 There is no
guarantee that long-term policies, if enacted, will achieve the
anticipated aims, or that they will indeed make future people better off
by achieving these aims.219 If things do not work out, these policies
might be deemed illegitimate on public utility grounds by the very
future people that they were supposed to benefit.220 In addition, such
policies may be deemed illegitimate by future people on expressed
preference grounds.221 Legitimacy on expressed preference grounds
typically requires some form of authorization by those who are affected
by policies, yet future people who will be affected by past policies
never authorize them, nor can they hold anyone accountable.222

[Another reason for democracies' short-termism is the scheduling of
participatory events]{.underline}.223 Democracy requires elections,
which must be relatively frequent in order to ensure that people can
regularly express their will, vote out politicians who are judged to
have failed in some important ways, and prevent rent-seeking behavior by
not giving politicians enough time to set up camp within
institutions.224 However, [the relatively **short duration of electoral
cycles** ensures that politicians are constantly concerned with their
own reelection, and this may prevent them from taking hard policy
decisions that require a great deal of political capital and do not
produce appreciable outcomes in time for the next
election]{.underline}.225 [Because most of the **[impacts]{.mark}** of
climate change will largely **materialize in the future** and be felt by
future generations, efforts at their alleviation must obey a clock that
is **[not in sync with the electoral clock]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Note that there is no need to assume that politicians are always and
necessarily motivated by only a thirst for power.226 In a democ- racy,
even politicians who are exclusively motivated by the aspiration to make
good long-term policy need to be elected or re-elected to do so.227 In
order to be elected, they need to harness the votes of the current
electorate.228 So, the problem of short-termism goes beyond a lack of
conscientious far-sightedness on the side of politicians: it is
structurally connected to the very fact of popular sovereignty---at
least as long as the majority of people discount the future.229

C. **[[Veto Players]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Any political system (with the possible exclusion of some forms of
anarchy) accords veto powers to some agent: a monarchy to the king, an
aristocracy to the nobility, a technocracy to the experts, a theocracy
to the religious leader, and so on.230 A veto player in a political
system can be understood as an agent who can prevent a departure from
the status quo.231 In democracies, veto players can be specified by
constitutions (e.g., the President and the Congress in the United
States), emerge from the political system (e.g., the Supreme Court in
the United States, political parties that are members of a government
coalition in Western Europe), or from civil society (e.g., powerful
industries, unions or other interest groups in many countries).232

In a democracy, veto players can protect minority interests, prevent
destabilizing change, and preserve important values and policies through
periods in which they are unpopular.233 More generally, veto players
prevent a democratic system from being excessively fluid and
flexible.234 This is attractive when the status quo is desirable or an
exogenous shock is beneficial; however, when the status quo is
undesirable or an exogenous shock disturbs a desirable status quo,
fluidity and flexibility are needed in order to respond quickly

and decisively.235 This is arguably the situation in the case of climate

change, which demands nimble political responses to which veto

players would have to acquiesce.

[The presence of many veto players threatens to delay or even block the
formulation and implementation of policy]{.underline}.236 Liberal
democracies, with their reliance on checks and balances generated by
institutional architecture or by competition among interest groups, seem
particularly vulnerable to such threats---and the more veto players in a
democracy the greater the degree of vulnerability.237

[An **especially high concentration of veto players** helps to explain
why a powerful, rich, technological leader like the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is **uncannily slow** to address consequential
public issues such as the politics of distribution, racial equality,
immigration, the proper balance between liberty and national security,
and of course climate change]{.underline}.238 The United States
Constitution separates powers in the federal government, reserves a
broad range of powers to states and includes a bill of rights that can
be viewed as effectively giving veto powers to individuals in some
circumstances. Practices have also developed through time that inhibit
action, such as requiring supermajorities for some political decisions.

[The profusion of **veto players** may be extreme in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [but it [is]{.mark} a feature
[common to]{.mark} many **[liberal democracies]{.mark}** that often
[makes]{.mark} political [action **elusive**]{.mark} even on relatively
minor policy issues]{.underline}.239 For every possible policy change,
there is always a "do-nothing" alternative (sometimes more respectably
presented as a "wait and see" alternative) that is invariably attractive
to some veto player.240

"Do-nothing" alternatives may sometimes be justified on grounds of
rational choice considerations relating to transition costs and
uncertainty about both the process of transition and the final pay-off
structure.241 Veto players give voice to such considerations, as well as
other considerations that we have already noted.242 But veto players may
also give voice to less rational tendencies, which are inevitably
present and, in democracies, are crystallized in votes. Among these
tendencies may be disproportionate attention to sunk costs, finding
refuge in "what has always worked," fear of regretting the changes made,
the desire to maintain and transmit a sense of control by not acceding
to the demands of new circumstances, and lack of trust in those who are
proposing the changes.243

Veto players tend to slow down or block deviations from the status quo,
and this makes it difficult to tackle climate change and other similar
problems of the Anthropocene.244 But veto players also reflect and
configure real structures of power, and protect and promote the needs
and interests of actual people.245 When the number of veto players or
the importance of specific veto players is altered, new power structures
emerge and this can raise legitimacy challenges on both utility and
expressed preference grounds.246 It is not obvious what veto players
should be eliminated or demoted in order to produce more nimble and
effective climate policy, and which ones should be given additional
power instead. Nor is it obvious who should decide the answers to these
questions (if not the people) and on what grounds (if not majority
rule).

Veto players configure systems of checks and balances, filters and
buffers, which are only partially exposed to popular influence.247 This
anti-majoritarian service is particularly precious to liberal
democracies, which rely on veto players to protect and promote the
rights of individuals and minorities---and, with that, the core liberal
principles of individual liberty and human rights. However, as a
consequence, if a majority exists that is overwhelmingly convinced by
climate science, totally in favor of leaving all remaining fossil energy
sources in the ground, and ready to embark on ambitious renewable energy
programs, this majority may still find it difficult to act. Liberal
democracies protect minorities of various kinds in varying degrees, and
these include climate change denialists and those who profit from fossil
fuels. Economically powerful and en- trenched economic minorities (the
"1%") are often extremely effective veto players.248 This can prevent
action that would benefit most people, thus increasing the risks of
legitimacy challenges.

D. **[Contested Role of Experts]{.underline}**

Climate change and other problems of the Anthropocene are unprecedented
phenomena whose complexity and implications are only beginning to be
understood by scientists and other experts. Climate change is a
multidimensional problem that concerns and connects ecology, demography,
development, production, consumption, resource use, trade rules, health,
security, urban planning, mobility, migration, and more, in novel
ways.249 It poses threats that are multi-scalar, probabilistic,
indirect, often invisible, spatiotemporally unbound, and potentially
catastrophic. These threats challenge our reason, emotions, and
imagination.250 If there were ever a complex problem that required
expert knowledge, it is climate change.

Liberal democracies make significant use of expert knowledge in
policymaking in various ways to protect liberal values, and to boost
their efficiency, equity, and political stability.251 Expert knowledge
is distinguished from non-expert opinion through such criteria as
experience, professional and educational qualifications, peer-review,
and rules of evidence.252

Still, in a democracy, differences in expertise do not translate to
differences in political authority, for much the same reason why
differences in lineage do not translate in this way. A democratic
citizen can recognize expertise and accept the science of, say, climate
change, and still object to the expert who counsels some course of
action: "You may be right, but who made you boss?"253 In a democracy,
expertise is always subservient to the voice of the people (pace Plato,
philosophers cannot be kings).254

For this reason, the relationships between experts and ordinary citizens
are always potentially fraught in a democracy. These relationships vary
from country to country, time to time, and issue to issue. Often, the
relationships are placid in good times and rocky in hard times. Major
policy failures, such as the global financial crisis of 2008 and the
spreading of terrorist radicalization in many European Union countries,
can lead citizens to question experts' knowledge and see them as just
another interest group seeking rents at people's expense.255

In the case of climate change, an additional element makes the role of
experts potentially unpopular. Climate science, in our present social
context, inevitably provokes fundamental questions about how we ought to
live and organize our societies, throwing doubt on the ways in which we
do so now. A particularly powerful and widespread attempt to avoid
cognitive dissonance through various forms of rationalization may thus
come into play. After all, if something potentially catastrophic such as
climate change can result from the very ways in which we live our
everyday lives---how we dwell, how we eat, how we make things, how we
move around---the nagging thought is that there might be something
fundamentally wrong about the ways in which we live. These are not
comfortable thoughts and can lead to resentment or worse towards those
who bear the message.

The incipient conflict and simmering resentment has been exploited by
powerful interests who look to be the immediate losers from a transition
to a more sustainable way of life. They stoke the dissonance and
encourage denialism. The most obvious manifestation of this is the
climate change denial campaign, directed towards preventing the
formation of a consensus for political action on climate change.256

The main strategy of climate change denialists has been to suppress both
belief in the science and belief that there is a scientific consensus on
the existence, anthropogenic nature, and dangerousness of climate
change.257 In its aims and strategies, climate change denialism has
replicated earlier forms of denialism involving tobacco smoking, acid
rain, DDT, and ozone depletion. 258

The rhetorical techniques adopted by climate change denialism have also
not been particularly original: versions of these techniques were used
in all the other cases mentioned above. These techniques include
attacking sources rather than discussing evidence, "moving the goalpost"
by requesting ever larger amounts of evidence, submitting false
evidence, suggesting false equivalences or analogies, confusing
ignorance about mechanisms or processes with ignorance about facts or
outcomes, cherry-picking anomalies, selective skepticism, quote mining,
and the so-called "Gish gallop"---overwhelming discussants or audiences
with unscientific claims to make it difficult to counter all the
misinformation at once.259

What is new about denialism in the Anthropocene is not its strategies or
tactics, but its amplification. Expertise denialism now travels through
social media, which allows for unfiltered instant communication among
citizens and between citizens and representatives. Traditional
intermediaries---political parties, intellectuals, and the professional
press---are increasingly made redundant by these technologies. Indeed,
to maintain their relevance (and market share), these traditional
intermediaries often seek to replicate the immediacy and excitement of
social media, compromising their own claims to epistemological or
institutional privilege.

One effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is an increased tendency to
brand political ideas and policy proposals and to market them as
products.260 The need to engage audiences with arguments and relevant
facts---and even to maintain consistency in one's opinions--- decreases,
while the need for a good, resonant, quick-win pitch increases. With
that, the importance of expert knowledge is downplayed to the advantage
of skilled branding and marketing.

Another effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is a polarizing fragmentation,
not just at the level of policy judgments, but also regarding the sets
of facts to which different individuals and groups make reference.
Social media allows for networked, yet highly fragmented, political
communication, making it harder to individuate and even debate a common
story.261

Much empirical work in psychology, economics, political science,
sociology, and communications has gone into trying to explain how and
why disagreement about facts can occur.262 The explanation seems to be
some sort of "biased assimilation," whereby people adjust their view of
facts with reference to their self-defining values, social identities,
and partisan allegiances.263 Experiments on reception suggest that
individuals selectively credit or dismiss information in a manner that
reinforces beliefs congenial to their values.264 These experiments found
that subjects were substantially more likely to count a scientist as an
authoritative "expert" when the scientist was depicted as taking a
position consistent with the subjects' cultural predispositions, than
when that scientist took a contrary position.265 Interestingly, these
tendencies seem to be directly, rather than inversely, related to levels
of science literacy and general education of experimental subjects: the
more equipped people are to know and understand the facts, the more they
disagree on them.266

In times of social media, these tendencies may be amplified, insofar as
individuals tend to gravitate towards and engage mostly with resonant
networks of "like-me's" that by and large reaffirm their own values and
perspectives.267 This may tribalize positions and impede constructive
democratic engagement and debate from ever taking off on many contested
issues. In addition, one can expect increasing polarization to also be
fomented by individuals and groups trying to secure loyalty to their
branded political ideas and policy proposals in this way.

The internet and other media, with their seemingly endless resources,
create the impression that expertise can be picked and chosen at will,
thereby feeding the perception of public life as a spectacle.268 Public
discussions, unfiltered by "moderators," unfold in a denuded space
stripped of epistemological norms.269 In the United States at least,
this has morphed into a generalized atmosphere of expertise denialism
writ large. Denialism about evolution, vaccines, economics, and more has
become commonplace.270

It is not an exaggeration to say that we are on the verge of adopting
epistemological nihilism as a public epistemology.271 No commitment to
facts, in the traditional sense, or even consistency of opinion, is
required.272 Truth is what the speaker says it is, here and now. In a
moment it may be different, depending on what the speaker can get away
with. In a democracy, it is up to elections or approval ratings to
resolve disagreements. It is a short step from here to other exercises
of power.

The nihilistic turn in public epistemology threatens the legitimacy of
democracy, for democracy cannot solve the problems it faces without
mobilizing epistemological authority that is itself hostage to popular
vote. As difficult as this challenge may be in favorable times, it is
greatly magnified in the face of climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene.

E. Self-referring Decision-making

What we have elsewhere called the "agency presupposition" is deeply
entrenched in modern democratic theory. This presupposition holds "that
the political community is constituted by agents who initiate and
conduct political action, and who themselves, and their interests and
welfare, are what matter politically."273 The agency presupposition
arose at a time in which democratic principles, norms and institutions
were being developed to govern relations between agents who lived in
close proximity to one another in space and time, and whose decisions
and actions had relatively direct impacts on each other. However, around
1950, a profound change occurred from a world of discrete but
interdependent states to a world of shared social space in which distant
events have localized impacts and vice-versa. In this globalized world,
the fates of nation-states and their peoples became not just effectively
interdependent, but also structurally interconnected, with social,
political, and economic activities, interactions, and infrastructures
stretching beyond political frontiers, leading to a deepening enmeshment
of the local and the global.274 Political decisions and actions taken
locally (in selected powerful countries, many of which were democratic)
now systematically had planetary implications, impacting for better or
worse the welfare and interests of people in all corners of the world.

With the Anthropocene disruption of earth's fundamental ecological
systems, including those that govern climate, political agents (living
humans who can initiate and conduct political action) have gained
unprecedented power over a vast universe of non-agents that comprises
animate and inanimate nature as well as those living on the periphery of
both space and time.275 The circle of affected nonagents has expanded
beyond cultural, genetic, and spatiotemporal boundaries to include
virtually everything on the planet, now extended indefinitely in
time.276 This establishes an enormous asymmetry of power. Those on the
periphery, and nature, cannot initiate and conduct political action:
they cannot reciprocate, they cannot participate, they cannot protest,
they cannot retaliate.277 In democratic terms, they do not matter---or
only matter derivatively, if political agents care about their fate. And
it is as undemocratic as can be, particularly if the democracy in
question is a liberal democracy, to force political agents to care if
they do not.278

A phenomenon like climate change creates ubiquitous tensions and
trade-offs between agents and non-agents---those who are governed, and
those who are affected.279 The latter will suffer most from climate
change, but a democracy responsive to the claims of future generations
(or those living beyond its borders, or nonhuman nature) may often have
to forgo opportunities for bringing beneficial consequences to those who
empower it with their votes.280 Instead, democratic leaders would have
to enact policies favoring the interests of those who do not vote
because they do not yet exist (or live in different countries or are not
human).

Democracies making policies that favor non-agents will expose themselves
to intra-generational legitimacy challenges on both public utility
grounds and expressed preference grounds.281 Even if the expected
benefits to non-agents were great, such non-agent-oriented policies
might not win the hearts, minds, and guts of living human agents who may
express their preference for themselves instead--- particularly in
democracies that are already being accused of not being responsive
enough to their citizens.282 Many believe that ignoring or heavily
discounting the welfare and interests of non-agents is morally wrong,
but if expressed preference is important, it may be a wrong that
democracies cannot avoid committing.283

The agency presupposition makes government responsive to those who are
governed but not to those who are affected beyond borders in space,
time, citizenship, or genetic make-up. A basic presupposition of liberal
democracy appears to be threatened by the very actions that would have
to be taken to express concern for all those affected by the
climate-changing and eco-altering actions of its citizens.

VII\. CONCLUSION

We began this Article by explaining the notion of the Anthropocene and
briefly telling the story of failed responses to climate change. We went
on to discuss the uneasy relationship between climate change and
democracy, focusing on liberal democracy in particular. We presented
some basic aspects of democratic theory and practice, and discussed some
of democracy's main vulnerabilities. We showed how in the Anthropocene
these vulnerabilities can magnify, leading to legitimacy challenges.

[These legitimacy challenges are not new. Democracy has always been
haunted by anxiety about its future]{.underline}. Some political
theorists have argued that [**[democracy]{.mark}** is the only form of
political organization that **[underwrites]{.mark}** the seeds of **[its
own destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.284 [Demagogues and extremists
who wish to blow up the state are allowed the same freedoms as those who
seek to manage it more fairly and effectively]{.underline}. [The risk of
a [**democratically enabled democide** is **not**]{.mark} an
[**abstract** or **counterfactual**]{.mark} risk: the executioners of
German democracy came to power through the rules and procedures of the
**Weimar Republic**]{.underline}.285 If we open our eyes, we may see
these stories going on around us today.

Modern democracy is, in many respects, the most sophisticated
articulation of the human capacity for social organization. It is also
the most hospitable environment for the expression of human values that,
through centuries of emancipatory struggles, have come to be regarded as
fundamental, such as individual liberty and political equality.286 Our
objective in this Article is not to write a requiem for democracy, but
rather to chart the seas that democratic theory and practice will have
to navigate in order to successfully address climate change and survive
the challenges of the Anthropocene. We have highlighted the
vulnerabilities of democracy in order to throw in sharp relief the many
challenges entailed by the voyage, not to discourage it. Democracy has
shown itself to be remarkably resilient in the past, and it may well
succeed in rising to these challenges as well. There are those who think
that democracy doesn't stand a chance.287 But many still believe that
the only solution to the problems of the Anthropocene lies in more,
better, or different democracy.288 And there are those who think that
even if democracy fails these challenges, democracy itself will not have
failed. For they see its value as intrinsic, and not just as a means to
better or more effective governance.289

It is difficult to sketch the nature of possible democratic solutions to
some of the issues that we have raised, and we will not try to do so
here. Instead, we will close with a summary of what seems to be the main
challenge ahead. The existing democratic deficits in liberal countries
will generally have to be reduced. Yet, in the case of climate change
and other problems of the Anthropocene, liberal democratic countries
will have to muster both the internal coherence and strength to better
resist populism, and the external coherence and strength to be more
cooperative partners within the framework of supranational institutions.
This is necessary because, in the Anthropocene, the global spills into
the domestic and vice-versa: a globally changing climate may have
pernicious local impacts on the territory and population of any given
country, while [[**political dysfunction in one country**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} cripple **[[\[halt\] efforts at global
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The democracies of the Anthropocene will have to work at multiple scales
in both space and time, incorporating the interests of the global with
those of the local, and those of the future with those of the present.
This seems to suggest, perhaps paradoxically, that the democracies of
the Anthropocene will have to be more democratic in some respects and
less democratic in others. The relation between popular sovereignty and
institutions that limit popular sovereignty while respecting it is a
tug-of-war in democratic theory and practice that has been going on for
millennia, and is now being put to unprecedented tests.

Liberal democracies, in particular, have an enormous amount at stake.
Liberal political theory has always recognized the right to resist and
even overthrow illegitimate political power.290 This right has been used
to justify historical events that liberals typically applaud, including
the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, and the American
Revolution.291 Despite their failures and excesses, these revolutions
forwarded liberal values and helped to entrench them in institutions.
Unable to find consistent responses to challenges to their own
legitimacy in the Anthropocene, liberal democracies may be in danger of
warranting revolutions against themselves and the very institutions that
should realize their values. They may become the ancient regime.

the Risks," Terrorism and Political Violence, vol. 33, no. 1,

[The likelihood that anyone **outside a war zone**]{.underline} [will be
killed by an]{.underline} Islamist [extremist terrorist is **extremely
small**. In the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, for example, [some]{.underline} **[six
people]{.underline}** [have perished each year since 9/11 at the hands
of such [terrorists]{.mark}---for an annual fatality rate of about **one
in 50 million**]{.underline} for the period.

This might be taken to suggest, as one writer has characterized it, that
"terrorism is such a minor threat to American life and limb that
[[it's]{.mark} simply **bizarre**---just **[stupefyingly irrational and
intellectually unserious]{.mark}**---to suppose that it could even
**begin** to justify]{.underline} the abolition of privacy rights as
they have been traditionally understood in favour of the installation of
a panoptic [surveillance]{.underline} state." 1 And [terrorism
**specialist**]{.underline} Marc Sageman [characterizes [the
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} terrorists present in the United States
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} "rather
**[[negligible]{.underline}]{.mark}**." 2 The vast majority of what is
commonly tallied as [terrorism]{.underline} has occurred **[in war
zones]{.underline}**, and this is especially true for fatalities.3 But
**[even]{.underline}** this [[has been
**exaggerated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by [conflating
**terror**]{.mark}ism [with **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}: civil war
violence that would previously have been seen to be acts of insurgency
are now often labeled terrorism.4

In order to put the numbers in some context, it has often been pointed
out that **[[far more]{.mark} Americans [are killed]{.mark} each
year]{.underline}** [not only by such]{.underline} highly
**[destructive]{.underline}** [hazards as **drug**]{.underline}
overdose**[s]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[automobile]{.underline}** accident**[s]{.underline}**, [but even
by]{.underline} such comparatively **[minor]{.underline}**
[ones]{.underline} as lightning, accident-causing
**[deer]{.underline}**, **[peanut]{.underline}** allergie[**s**, or
**[drowning in bathtubs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some comparisons are
arrayed in Table 1.

In recent years, however, critics have attacked what they call "the
bathtub fallacy." 5

First, they stress that it is important to keep in mind that bathtubs
are not out to kill you while terrorism is a willful act carried out by
diabolical, dedicated, and clever human beings. Thus, although the
number of people Islamist terrorists have been able to kill in the West
since 9/11 has thus far been quite limited, those terrorists, as they
plot and plan and learn from experience, may very well become far more
destructive in the future.

Second, the critics charge that the comparison of terrorism with bathtub
drownings is incomplete in that it doesn't consider the possibility that
the incidence of terrorist destruction is low precisely because
counterterrorism measures are so effective.

Third, it is argued that, unlike bathtub drownings, terrorism exacts
costs far beyond those entailed in the event itself. It damagingly sows
terror, fear, and anxiety; disturbs our

![Table Description automatically

height="3.976396544181977in"}

psychological well-being; undermines trust and openness within the
society; and reduces our sense of intrinsic moral worth even as it
increases a sense of helplessness. They maintain, fourth, that the
comparison is invalid because, unlike terrorism, bathtubs provide
benefit.

And finally, they contend that terrorism costs are peculiarly high,
particularly in a democratic society, because the fears it generates
will necessarily need to be serviced by policy makers, and this pressure
forces, or inspires, them to adopt countermeasures, both foreign and
domestic, that are costly and sometimes even excessive.

In this article, we examine these five propositions and find all of them
to be wanting. In the process, we conclude that terrorism is rare
outside war zones because, to a substantial degree, terrorists don't
exist there. In general, as with rare diseases that kill few, it makes
more policy sense to expend limited funds on hazards that inflict far
more damage.

Terrorism is willed and may well become more destructive

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg has suggested that "the fear of terrorism
isn't motivated solely by what terrorists have done, but what terrorists
hope to do." Bathtubs are simply not "engaged in a conspiracy with other
bathtubs to murder ever-larger numbers of Americans." However,
terrorists "in the Islamist orbit," he insists, "seek unconventional
weapons that would allow them to kill a far-larger number of Americans
than died on Sept. 11." 6 Or as Janan Ganesh of the Financial Times puts
it, "Bathroom deaths could multiply by 50 without a threat to civil
order. The incidence of terror could not." 7

Thus far, [9/11 stands out as an **extreme outlier**: scarcely any
terrorist act, before or after, in war zones or outside them, has
inflicted **even one-tenth**]{.underline} [as much]{.underline} total
[destruction]{.underline}. That is, contrary to common expectations,
[the attack has]{.underline} thus far [been an]{.underline}
[**aberration**, **not** a **harbinger**]{.underline}.8 And
[**[a]{.mark}**l-**[Q]{.mark}**aeda central]{.underline}, the group
responsible for the attack, [has]{.underline}, in some respects at
least, [[proved]{.mark} to resemble]{.underline} President John
Kennedy's assassin, [**Lee Harvey Oswald**---an entity
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[trivial proportions]{.underline}**
[that got]{.underline}]{.mark} **[horribly [lucky
once]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The tiny group of perhaps 100 or so does
appear to have served as something of an inspiration to some Muslim
extremists. They may have done some training, may have contributed a bit
to the Taliban's far larger insurgency in Afghanistan, and may have
participated in a few terrorist acts in Pakistan. In his examination of
the major terrorist plots against the West since 9/11, Mitchell Silber
finds only two---the shoe bomber attempt of 2001 and the effort to blow
up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs in 2006---that could be
said to be under the "command and control" of al-Qaeda central (as
opposed to ones suggested, endorsed, or inspired by the organization),
and there are questions about how full its control was even in these two
instances, both of which, as it happens, failed miserably.9 And,
although some al-Qaeda affiliates have committed substantial damage in
the Middle East, usually in the context of civil wars, their efforts to
carry out terrorism in the West have been rare and completely
ineffective.10 Even under siege, it is difficult to see why al-Qaeda
could not have carried out attacks at least as costly and shocking as
the shooting rampages (organized by other groups) that took place in
Mumbai in 2008 or at a shopping center in Kenya in 2013. Neither took
huge resources, presented major logistical challenges, required the
organization of a large number of perpetrators, or needed extensive
planning.

However, [there is of course no guarantee that things will
**remain**]{.underline} [that way, and the 9/11 attacks inspired the
remarkable **extrapolation**]{.underline} [that, because the
[terrorists]{.mark} were **successful with box cutters**, they might
**soon** be [able to **turn**]{.mark} **out weapons of mass
destruction**--- particularly **[nuclear]{.mark}**]{.underline}
ones---and then detonate them in an American city. For example, in his
influential 2004 book, Nuclear Terrorism, Harvard's Graham
**[Allison]{.underline}** [relayed]{.underline} his "considered
judgment" [that]{.underline} "on the current path, [a nuclear terrorist
attack on America in the **decade**]{.underline} ahead [is]{.underline}
more **[likely]{.underline}** than not." 11 Allison has had a great deal
of company in his alarming pronouncements. In 2007, the distinguished
physicist Richard Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an
American or European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per
year, which would work out to 91 percent over the elevenyear period to
2018.12

**[Allison's time is up]{.underline}**, and so is Garwin's.
[These]{.underline} oft-repeated [[warnings have
proven]{.underline}]{.mark} to be **[[empty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And
it is important to point out that [[not only]{.mark} have terrorists
**[failed]{.mark}** to go nuclear, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} as William
Langewiesche, who has assessed the process in detail, put it in 2007,
"[[The **best info**]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark} that **[no one has
gotten]{.mark} anywhere [near]{.mark}**]{.underline} this. I mean, if
you look carefully and practically at this process, you see that [[it
is]{.mark} an **enormous undertaking**]{.underline} [[full of
**risks**]{.mark} for]{.underline} the would-be
[terrorists]{.underline}." 13 [That process [requires trusting
**corrupt**]{.mark}ed foreign [**collaborators**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[**criminals**, obtaining]{.mark} and
transporting highly]{.underline} [[**guarded material**, setting
up]{.mark} a machine shop staffed with **[top
scientists]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technicians]{.underline}**, [[and **rolling**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[heavy]{.underline}**, cumbersome, and
**[[untested]{.underline}]{.mark}** finished
**[[product]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into]{.underline}
**[position]{.underline}** [to be detonated [by a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[skilled crew]{.underline}**]{.mark}, all the [while [attracting **no
attention**]{.mark}]{.underline} from outsiders.

[[Nor]{.mark} have terrorist groups been [able to steal]{.mark} existing
nuclear]{.underline} [[weapons]{.mark}---characteristically burdened
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[multiple [safety
devices]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} often [stored
in]{.underline} pieces at separate **[secure
locales]{.underline}**---from existing arsenals as was once much feared.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} [they certainly have [not]{.mark} been able
to [cajole]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[leaders]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
nuclear states [[to]{.underline} **[palm one off]{.underline}**]{.mark}
to them---though a war inflicting more death than Hiroshima and Nagasaki
combined was launched against Iraq in 2003 in major part under the spell
of fantasies about such a handover.14

More generally, [the **actual [terrorist]{.mark}**]{.underline}
"adversarie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in the **West**]{.underline}
**[scarcely]{.underline}** [deserve accolades for either **dedication**
or **prowess**]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that sometimes even
incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are
rare. [For the most part, terrorists in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[are a
**confused**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[inadequate]{.underline}**,
**[[incompetent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[blundering]{.underline}**,
and **[gullible [bunch]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [only]{.underline}
**[occasionally]{.underline}** [able to get their act together. Most
seem to be far [better at **frenetic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and often
**[self-deluded [scheming]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} at [actual
**[execution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A summary assessment by RAND's
Brian Jenkins is apt: "[their **numbers** remain **small**, their
**determination limp**, and their **competence poor**]{.underline}." 15
And much [the same holds for **Europe**]{.underline} [and the
**rest**]{.underline} [of the developed world]{.underline}.16 Also
working against terrorist success in the West is the fact that [almost
**[all]{.mark}** are **[amateurs]{.mark}**: they have never before tried
to do something like this. Unlike **criminals** they have **not been
able to develop street smarts**.]{.underline}

[Except perhaps for the use of vehicles to [deliver]{.mark}
mayhem]{.underline} (though this idea is by no means new in the history
of terrorism), [there has been]{.underline} remarkably **[[little
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terrorist weaponry or methodology
since 9/11]{.underline}.17 Like their predecessors, [they have continued
to rely on bombs]{.underline} (many of which fail to detonate or do much
damage) [and bullets]{.underline}.18

Cautions and Caveats

It is important to note that [scientific advances and]{.underline} the
[**emergence** of **new tech**nologies are **not** the only, or even the
**most important**, factors **influencing** the [**likelihood** of
**terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}** acquiring and **[using CBRN
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thankfully, the [[number of]{.mark}
terrorist [groups]{.mark} motivated to acquire these weapons [has been
limited, despite]{.mark} [many that have]{.mark}]{.underline} the
requisite [technical and financial [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.60
The [**[vast majority]{.mark}** of **terrorist** groups have been
[**satisfied** with **conventional**]{.mark} **weapons**]{.underline}
such as guns and bombs. The surprising rise of the Islamic State and
their repeated use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria, however, serve
as a reminder that it only takes one group with the intent and
capability to acquire and use CBRN weapons to pose a threat to
international security.61

In addition, the [[ability]{.mark} of a terrorist group to convert
CBRN-related material into a weapon [depends on]{.mark}]{.underline}
intangible factors such as **[[tacit knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(the unarticulated knowledge that can only be gained through hands-on,
trial-and-error experience or mentorship), the [**ability** of the group
to **create and share** such **knowledge**, [and its ability to
**assemble**]{.mark} and successfully **manage** **interdisciplinary
teams**]{.underline}.62 [Terrorist [groups]{.mark}, especially those
**facing pressure** from **law enforcement** and **intel**ligence
agencies, [have had **difficulties** **recruiting**]{.mark},
**retaining**, [and]{.mark} effectively [**utilizing** individuals
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [right **combination** of **scientific**,
**technical**, and **organizational [skills]{.mark}** to develop
effective CBRN weapons]{.underline}.

[Developing a CBRN weapon capable of]{.underline} causing [**mass
casualties** is also a **very complex** process. A scientific
[breakthrough that makes]{.mark} **developing** or acquiring **[one
component]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a weapon [[easier]{.mark} might [not
have any impact on]{.mark} the [other stages]{.mark} in the
weaponization process]{.underline}. Thus, the [impact of a single
scientific breakthrough]{.underline} or a novel technology on the
acquisition of a CBRN weapon [should not be exaggerated]{.underline}.
For example, [**[syn]{.mark}**thetic **[bio]{.mark}**logy might make it
easier]{.underline} for a non-state actor [to create]{.underline} a
pathogen, [but]{.underline} that technology [**[does not help]{.mark}**
terrorists improve their **[ability to disseminate]{.mark}** the
pathogen on a large scale]{.underline}.63

Likewise, it is important to assess the [specific contributions that a
particular technology can make to a specific aspect of]{.underline} the
[CBRN threat in practice, not just in theory]{.underline}. In the case
of [[3D printing]{.underline}]{.mark}, this manufacturing technology [is
**[not appropriate]{.mark}** for working with **[metals]{.mark}** that
[are **toxic** or **radioactive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
microreactors are well-suited to covertly producing small quantities of
highly pure chemicals, [they are **not well-suited** to]{.underline} the
[production of **most chemical warfare agents**]{.underline} and
precursors [due to **[excessive heat]{.mark}** generated]{.underline} by
their synthesis [[and]{.mark} by the **production** of **[solid
byproducts]{.mark}** that would **[clog]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[microfluidic [channels]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the heart of this
technology.64

Finally, [[advances in]{.mark} science and **[tech]{.mark}**nology
represent]{.underline} not just threats, but also [opportunities to
[make it harder]{.mark} for terrorist groups [to acquire]{.mark} CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nmanned
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial and ground
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [can be
[used for border security]{.mark}, CBRN weapon [detection, and]{.mark}
bomb [disposal]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the EU is sponsoring
the development of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to investigate
CBRN crime scenes under the ROCSAFE project.65 [[Biometrics]{.mark} and
radio frequency ID chips can be used to [improve **physical
security**]{.mark} **measures** and **inventory control** to prevent
unauthorized access to CBRN materials]{.underline}. Advances in science
and technology are also leading to **[improved
[sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [can be used to [detect]{.mark} the
**[production]{.mark}**, **transportation**, and **use** of CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. The [development of dedicated laboratories and new
techniques to analyze CBRN materials has also contributed to impressive
advances in nuclear, biological, and chemical forensics, which are
crucial for attribution]{.underline}.66

\*added \[overlooked\]

With dozens of treaty allies and a strategic priority of promoting the
sovereignty of weak states, [the U.S. **[military]{.mark}** has been
gradually **[shifting]{.mark}** from a force designed for confrontation
[to]{.mark} one intended to promote international
**cooperation**]{.underline}. To be sure, the U.S. military retains a
technical and doctrinal advantage as a warfighting entity. However, over
the past two decades, the military has been incorporating new
organizations, doctrine, and training to prioritize efforts to prevent
war [through **[security]{.mark} force
[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has shifted focus to weak
states where sub-national (e.g., gangs in Central America) and
trans-national security challenges (e.g., al-Qa'ida) jeopardize
sovereignty and regional stability.1 Consequently, countries such as the
Philippines, Georgia, Colombia, Uganda, and Pakistan have requested
security assistance from the United States. While level of support
varies, U.S. forces are enabling partner countries to combat challenges
that threaten their own stability.

[This shift in focus [has **raised concerns** about]{.mark} the
"**[militarization]{.mark}** of U.S. **fo**reign
**po**licy,"]{.underline} which began in the 1990s with the recognition
that combatant commanders are as much policy entrepreneurs as they are
war fighters.2 Generals like Tony Zinni or Wesley Clark epitomized the
new breed of warrior-diplomat who directly engaged with foreign heads of
state.3 Far from rogue generals, these military leaders were directed by
President Bill Clinton to engage with the world and promote security by
assisting partners and assuring allies in a security environment freed
from the Cold War dynamic. President George W. Bush and President Barack
Obama continued the practice of using the military to assist almost
every government of the world. As Administrations from both parties came
to value the military's capabilities in peace and war, [some contended
that defense overshadowed (if not displaced) traditional diplomacy and
development efforts]{.underline}.4 Within defense circles, [critics
assumed that helping weak states **jeopardized** American **military
dominance** and **undercut preparations for major war**]{.underline}.5
More recently, [[critics highlight]{.mark} that in an era of declining
budgets, the]{.underline} United States [military cannot afford nor
overcome **[unintended consequences]{.mark}** of attempting to be a
"global force for good."]{.underline}6 These are valid concerns,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States shows no signs of
retreating from a global leadership role and instead seeks partnerships
as a key component of U.S. strategy.

With shared challenges of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and
shared goals of development and protecting human security, there are
unprecedented levels of international cooperation to share information,
target terrorists, and provide governments the tools they need to
confront national threats before they become regional ones. This is on
display in Afghanistan where 50 countries operate under the ISAF flag,
or in the Indian Ocean where 27 countries operate as Combined Maritime
Forces. At the center of the coalitions is a U.S.-sponsored framework to
enable partners to contribute to international security.

President Barack Obama intends to continue the American tradition of
enabling partners throughout the globe. As he noted in his second
inaugural address, "America will remain the anchor of strong alliances
in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that
extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. For no one has a greater
stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation." [By [training
and equipping]{.mark} other militaries, the goal is to
**[reduce]{.mark}** U.S. American [**military presence internationally**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} allow others to provide for their own security.
[This [has **positive benefits**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only for the
U.S. defense budget (e.g., an Afghan soldier costs hundreds per month
compared to an American soldier who costs thousands per month), but also
[[for **international security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While my earlier
book Exporting Security explains why the United States assists
governments from Afghanistan to Zambia, an overlooked area is security
assistance provided to developed countries.

CAPACITY MATTERS

As France recently learned in Mali, while it has capable ground forces
and aircraft, it has limited ability to sustain these forces just 2,000
miles from home. To support its foreign policy agenda, France needed the
United States Air Force to fly its forces and refuel its attack
aircraft. As the operation continues, the United States will probably
provide intelligence for French and African forces as they shift to
stability operations.

Counterterrorism can certainly explain U.S. intervention in Mali;
however, enabling French success explains the timeline. More
importantly, the case of U.S.-supported French intervention in Mali is
illustrative of the role the United States plays in supporting developed
countries. France is the latest developed country to need U.S.
assistance, but requests like this are common. This is true for almost
every one of the 50 countries serving in Afghanistan today, as it was
true with European countries in the Balkans, Australian forces in East
Timor, and British forces in West Africa. These examples highlight that
the foreign policy goals of many developed countries exceed their
military capacity, which requires them to rely on the U.S. military for
assistance. As developed countries' defense budgets fall further,
reliance on the United States is going to increase. This remains a
decades-old frustration. Most recently, the NATO Secretary General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, "There is a lower limit on how little we can
spend on defense, while living up to our responsibilities.\"7

Pragmatically, the United States would like its partners to do more, but
shared challenges and limited budgets will reinforce the value of
American logistics, combat experience, and intelligence capacity.
Further, American support of other countries reinforces the treaty
arrangements with 27 NATO countries and five Asian countries. Twenty
years ago, there seemed to be little relevance to these treaties and
security arrangements, let alone a rationale for invoking them or
expanding them. Yet, the opposite occurred. NATO increased its
membership three times from 16 to 19 in 1999, again to 26 in 2006, and
again to 28 in 2009. At the same time the number of NATO members
increased, NATO changed from its traditional mission of territorial
defense to one of global security engagement. With each expansion, new
members require training and equipping to NATO standards. With each new
operation, NATO countries require access to U.S. intelligence, critical
technology, and global logistics.

In addition to formal treaties of alliance, an additional dozen
countries are offered protection under the U.S. security umbrella either
by law, such as the Taiwan Relations Act or by policy such as United
States' support for Israel.8 These protections include provisions to
train and equip their militaries. Another dozen countries are offered
special security provisions through Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status.
MNNA does not confer a mutual defense relationship, but the largely
symbolic act implies a close working relationship with another
country\'s defense forces.9 It is more akin to a preferred buyer's
program allowing countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea access
to advanced weapons systems. With weapons purchases also come long-term
training and maintenance contracts. From a U.S. perspective, it has a
comparative advantage in defense exports; strategically, programs like
these are intended to overcome the free-rider problem the United States
faces with its partners.10 For every Joint Strike Fighter Japan buys,
the United States can deploy one less to northeast Asia.

Given the diplomatic nature of these security partnerships, the
Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs focuses these
activities, regulates the defense trade and arms transfers to reinforce
the military capabilities of friends, allies, and coalition partners,
and ensures that the transfer of U.S.-origin defense equipment and
technology supports U.S. national security interests. Further, the
Bureau promotes regional security through bilateral and multilateral
cooperation and dialogue, as well as through the provision of security
assistance to friendly countries and international peacekeeping efforts.
The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military balances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to Saudi
Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., South Korea), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old FARC insurgency). Historically, Israel has been
the largest recipient of security assistance and its neighbor Egypt
benefited from its recognition of Israel and the Camp David Accords.11
Given its proximity to the United States and challenges with drug
trafficking organizations, Mexico has recently emerged as a top
recipient of security assistance. Given the history of American military
interventions in Mexico, this has required new efforts to build trust to
reassure the government that it seeks to strengthen it and not undermine
it.12

One reason the United States concentrates assistance on just a few
countries is to promote particular countries as regional leaders. In
practice, this means that Jordan hosts an international special
operations exercise, peace operations training center, and an
international police training center. Or in Latin America, Colombia
provides helicopter training for regional militaries and El Salvador
hosts a regional peacekeeping institute, attracting military personnel
from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Given the significant
U.S. investment in Afghanistan's military and police training
infrastructure, it is likely that Afghanistan could eventually host
regional training if the insurgency subsides to acceptable levels. [This
approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also
**[reduces]{.mark}** the need for American [**presence** and the
**negative attention** it]{.mark} sometimes
[generates]{.mark}]{.underline}. We see the benefits of this today where
U.S.-trained Colombian pilots are training Mexican pilots in Colombia.

**\[Table 1: Top Recipients of U.S. International Assistance (Account
150) OMITTED\]**

In addition to the Department of State budget for security assistance,
the [**Defense** Department]{.underline} directly funds security
assistance through section 1206/7 and other command funds such as
Commander's Emergency Response Program. This [**authority** did provoke
more **concern** about **militarizing fo**reign **po**licy; **however**,
this **only** makes up]{.underline} about \$1 billion annually, which is
[**less than 15 percent** of **security assistance** funded by the
**State** Department. Further, U.S. **ambassadors must approve all
programs**]{.underline}. Thus, [the Department of **State exerts
considerable control of programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels** through the embassy country team]{.underline}.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE MILITARY

With national security focused on weak states and persistent security
concerns among stable allies like South Korea, the U.S. military has
been changing over the last 20 years from a force of confrontation to
one of cooperation. [The military has learned that partnership is better
than clientism and is adapting its command structure once optimized for
waging major combat to one that is focused on conflict prevention. There
is **still a tremendous warfighting capability** in the U.S. military,
but coalition warfare is the norm and developing compatible warfighting
partners is a key goal of this cooperative strategy]{.underline}. In
some sense, [this **[turns the idea of militarization]{.mark} of
fo**reign **po**licy **[on its head]{.mark}**; the [Pentagon is **being
demilitarized**]{.mark} and valued for its ability to impart military
capabilities to U.S. partners]{.underline}.

Given the current structure of the international system and
technological advances, the United States does not need partners in the
same way as it did in the past where they provided direct benefits
through coaling stations, maintenance facilities, or large bases. While
the number of forward bases is still substantial, the number of forward
deployed forces are greatly reduced. More importantly, the nature of the
presence has changed; the United States aspires to create true partners
that can confront their own threats to internal stability (e.g.,
assistance to Colombia's military) or alleviate security dilemmas (e.g.,
future basing in Australia). It also seeks to foster independence by
training and equipping militaries to support the global demand for
peacekeepers.14 The United States certainly gets increased access to
countries around the world through these programs, but given the
overwhelming military dominance of the United States, it does not abuse
these relationships or ignore seemingly insignificant states. Instead,
it seeks to create partners where sovereignty is respected and all
parties derive benefits. The latest example of this is U.S. withdrawal
from Iraq as dictated by a U.S.-Iraqi agreement.

[While the Defense Department's capacity certainly explains why
international assistance missions **increasingly have a military face**,
it is also essential to understand that **there is a global demand** for
U.S. security assistance. The **Defense** Department **has recognized
that there are limits to what it can do**; the military **wants** and
needs **partners** from **across** the **government**, **allies** and
**private organizations**. Unfortunately, these ideas
remain]{.underline} stunted [\[**overlooked**\] in the broader foreign
policy community that gets **easily overwhelmed by the size of the
Defense Department's resources**. For critics, U.S. military activities
in permissive environments bring old memories of invasion or coup. For
them, U.S. foreign policy is on a dangerous militarization
path]{.underline}. While that part of U.S. military history is real and
still resonates in many parts of the world, [[it is **wrong**]{.mark} to
overlook the changes that have occurred over the last two decades.
Further, it is wrong to overlook the significant demands developed
countries place on the United States]{.underline}.

#### No impact -- wouldn't escalate

**Quinlan 9** Michael Quinlan, former British defence strategist and
former Permanent Under-Secretary of State, *Thinking About Nuclear
Weapons*, 2009, p.63-69 /GoGreen!

Even if initial nuclear use did not quickly end the fighting, [the
supposition of inexorable momentum in a]{.underline} [developing
exchange, with each side rushing to [**overreaction** amid]{.mark}
confusion and [uncertainty, is **implausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It
fails to consider what the situation of the decisionmakers would really
be. **[Neither side]{.mark}** could **[want
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both would be appalled at what was
going on. [Both would be desperately look]{.underline}ing [for
signs]{.underline} that [the other was ready to]{.underline} call a
[halt.]{.underline} Both, given the capacity for evasion or concealment
which modern delivery platforms and vehicles can possess, could have in
reserve significant forces invulnerable enough not to entail use-or-lose
pressures. (It may be more open to question, as noted earlier, whether
newer nuclear-weapon possessors can be immediately in that position; but
it is within reach of any substantial state with advanced technological
capabilities, and attaining it is certain to be a high priority in the
development of forces.) As a result, [neither side can have any
predisposition to suppose, in an ambiguous situation of fearful risk,
that the right course when in doubt is to go on copiously launching
weapons]{.underline}. And **[none of this analysis rests
on]{.underline}** [any **presumption of** highly subtle or pre-concerted
**rationality**. The rationality required is plain.]{.underline} The
argument is reinforced if we consider the possible reasoning of an
aggressor at a more dispassionate level. Any substantial nuclear armoury
can inflict destruction outweighing any possible prize that aggression
could hope to seize. A state attacking the possessor of such an armoury
must therefore be doing so (once given that it cannot count upon
destroying the armoury pre-emptively) on a judgement that the possessor
would be found lacking in the will to use it. If the attacked possessor
used nuclear weapons, whether first or in response to the aggressor\'s
own first use, this judgement would begin to look dangerously
precarious. [There must be at least a **substantial possibility** of the
aggressor leaders\' concluding that their initial judgement had been
**mistaken**---that the risks were]{.underline} after all [greater than
whatever prize they had been seeking, and that for their own country\'s
survival they must call off the aggression]{.underline}. [**[Deterrence
planning]{.mark}** such as that [of **NATO**]{.mark} was directed [in
the first place]{.mark} to **[preventing]{.mark} the initial
[misjudgement]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} in the second, **[if]{.mark} it
were [nevertheless made]{.mark}**, to **[compelling]{.mark}** such a
**[reappraisal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The former aim had to have
primacy, because it could not be taken for granted that the latter was
certain to work. But there was no ground for assuming in advance, for
all possible scenarios, that the chance of its working must be
negligible. [An aggressor state would itself be at huge risk if nuclear
war developed, as its leaders would know.]{.underline} It may be argued
that a policy which abandons hope of physically defeating the enemy and
simply hopes to get him to desist is pure gamble, a matter of who blinks
first; and that the political and moral nature of most likely
aggressors, almost ex hypothesis, makes them the less likely to blink.
One response to this is to ask what is the alternative---it can only be
surrender. But a more positive and hopeful answer lies in the fact that
the criticism is posed in a political vacuum. Real-life conflict would
have a political context. The context which concerned NATO during the
cold war, for example, was one of defending vital interests against a
postulated aggressor whose own vital interests would not be engaged, or
would be less engaged. Certainty is not possible, but a clear asymmetry
of vital interest is a legitimate basis for expecting an asymmetry,
credible to both sides, of resolve in conflict. That places upon
statesmen, as page 23 has noted, the key task in deterrence of building
up in advance a clear and shared grasp of where limits lie. That was
plainly achieved in cold-war Europe. 11 vital interests have been
defined in a way that is clear, and also clearly not overlapping or
incompatible with those of the adversary, a credible basis has been laid
for the likelihood of greater resolve in resistance. [It
was]{.underline} also sometimes [suggested]{.underline} by critics [that
whatever might be indicated by theoretical discussion of]{.underline}
[political will and interests, the military environment of nuclear
warfare]{.underline}---particularly difficulties of communication and
control---[would drive escalation with overwhelming probability to the
limit]{.underline}. [But it is obscure why matters should be regarded as
inevitably so for every possible level and setting of action. Even if
the **history** of war suggested (as it **scarcely** does) that military
decision-makers]{.underline} are mostly apt to [work on the principle
\'When in doubt, **lash out**\', the nuclear revolution creates an
utterly new situation]{.underline}. The pervasive reality, always plain
to both sides during the cold war, is \'If this goes on to the end, we
are all ruined\'. [Given that inexorable escalation would mean
catastrophe for both, it would be perverse to suppose them permanently
incapable of framing arrangements which avoid it.]{.underline} As page
16 has noted, NATO gave its military commanders no widespread delegated
authority, in peace or war, to launch nuclear weapons without specific
political direction. [Many types of weapon moreover had **physical
safeguards** such as PALs incorporated to reinforce **organizational**
ones. There were multiple **communication** and **control** systems for
passing information, orders, and prohibitions.]{.underline} Such systems
could not be totally guaranteed against disruption if at a fairly
intense level of strategic exchange---which was only one of many
possible levels of conflict--- an adversary judged it to be in his
interest to weaken political control. It was far from clear why he
necessarily should so judge. Even then, however, it remained possible to
operate on a general fail-safe presumption: no authorization, no use.
That was the basis on which NATO operated. If it is feared that the
arrangements which a nuclear-weapon possessor has in place do not meet
such standards in some respects, the logical course is to continue to
improve them rather than to assume escalation to be certain and
uncontrollable, with all the enormous inferences that would have to flow
from such an assumption. The likelihood of escalation can never be 100
per cent, and never zero. Where between those two extremes it may lie
can never be precisely calculable in advance; and even were it so
calculable, it would not be uniquely fixed---it would stand to vary
hugely with circumstances. That there should be any risk at all of
escalation to widespread nuclear war must be deeply disturbing, and
decision-makers would always have to weigh it most anxiously. But a pair
of key truths about it need to be recognized. The first is that the risk
of escalation to large-scale nuclear war is inescapably present in any
significant armed conflict between nuclear-capable powers, whoever may
have started the conflict and whoever may first have used any particular
category of weapon. The initiator of the conflict will always have
physically available to him options for applying more force if he meets
effective resistance. If the risk of escalation, whatever its degree of
probability, is to be regarded as absolutely unacceptable, the necessary
inference is that a state attacked by a substantial nuclear power must
forgo military resistance. It must surrender, even if it has a nuclear
armoury of its own. But the companion truth is that, as page 47 has
noted, the risk of escalation is an inescapable burden also upon the
aggressor. [The exploitation of that burden is the crucial route, if
conflict does break out, for managing it to a tolerable outcome---the
only route, indeed, intermediate between surrender and holocaust, and so
the necessary basis for deterrence beforehand.]{.underline} The working
out of plans to exploit escalation risk most effectively in deterring
potential aggression entails further and complex issues. It is for
example plainly desirable, wherever geography, politics, and available
resources so permit without triggering arms races, to make provisions
and dispositions that are likely to place the onus of making the bigger
and more evidently dangerous steps in escalation upon the aggressor who
wishes to maintain his attack, rather than upon the defender. (The
customary shorthand for this desirable posture used to be \'escalation
dominance\'.) These issues are not further discussed here. But
addressing them needs to start from acknowledgement that there are in
any event no certainties or absolutes available, no options guaranteed
to be risk-free and cost-free. Deterrence is not possible without
escalation risk; and its presence can point to no automatic policy
conclusion save for those who espouse outright pacifism and accept its
consequences. Accident and **[Miscalculation]{.underline}** Ensuring the
safety and security of nuclear weapons plainly needs to be taken most
seriously. Detailed information is understandably not published, but
such direct evidence as there is suggests that it always has been so
taken in every possessor state, with the inevitable occasional failures
to follow strict procedures dealt with rigorously. [Critics]{.underline}
have nevertheless from time to time [argued that the possibility of
accident involving]{.underline} [nuclear weapons is]{.underline} so
[substantial]{.underline} that it must weigh heavily in the entire
evaluation of whether war-prevention structures entailing their
existence should be tolerated at all. Two sorts of scenario are usually
in question. The first is that of a single grave event involving an
unintended nuclear explosion---a technical disaster at a storage site,
for example, or the accidental or unauthorized launch of a delivery
system with a live nuclear warhead. The second is that of some
event---perhaps such an explosion or launch, or some other mishap such
as malfunction or misinterpretation of radar signals or computer
systems---initiating a sequence of response and counter-response that
culminated in a nuclear exchange which no one had truly intended. [No
event that is physically possible can be said to be of absolutely **zero
probability**]{.underline} (just as at an opposite extreme it is absurd
to claim, as has been heard from distinguished figures, that
nuclear-weapon use can be guaranteed to happen within some finite future
span despite not having happened for over sixty years). [But human
affairs cannot be managed to the standard of]{.underline} either zero or
total [probability]{.underline}. [We have to assess levels
between]{.underline} those [**theoretical limits and weigh their
reality** and implications against other factors, in security planning
as in everyday life. There have]{.underline} certainly
[been]{.underline}, across the decades since 1945, many known
[**accidents** involving nuclear weapons,]{.underline} from transporters
skidding off roads to bomber aircraft crashing with or accidentally
dropping the weapons they carried (in past days when such carriage was a
frequent feature of readiness arrangements---it no longer is). A few of
these accidents may have released into the nearby environment highly
toxic material. [**None**]{.underline} however has [entailed a nuclear
detonation]{.underline}. Some commentators suggest that this reflects
bizarrely good fortune amid such massive activity and deployment over so
many years. [A]{.underline} more [rational deduction from the facts of
this long experience would however be that the **[probability]{.mark}**
of any accident triggering a nuclear explosion [is **extremely
low**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It might be further noted that the
[mechanisms needed to set off such an explosion]{.underline} [are
technically demanding, and that]{.underline} in a large number of ways
[the past sixty years have seen extensive **improvements in safety**
arrangements for both the design and the handling of
weapons]{.underline}. It is undoubtedly possible to see respects in
which, after the cold war, some of the factors bearing upon risk may be
new or more adverse; but some are now plainly less so. The years which
the world has come through entirely without accidental or unauthorized
detonation have included early decades in which knowledge was sketchier,
precautions were less developed, and weapon designs were less ultra-safe
than they later became, as well as substantial periods in which weapon
numbers were larger, deployments more widespread and diverse, movements
more frequent, and several aspects of doctrine and readiness
arrangements more tense. [Similar considerations apply to the hypothesis
[of nuclear war being **mistakenly triggered**]{.mark} by false
alarm]{.underline}. Critics again point to the fact, as it is
understood, of numerous occasions when initial steps in alert sequences
for US nuclear forces were embarked upon, or at least called for, by
indicators mistaken or misconstrued. In none of these instances, it is
accepted, did matters get at all near to nuclear launch---extraordinary
good fortune again, critics have suggested. But [[the]{.mark} rival and
[more logical inference from **hundreds of events**]{.mark} stretching
[over **sixty years**]{.mark} of experience presents itself once more:
that the **probability** of]{.underline} initial [misinterpretation
leading]{.underline} far [towards mistaken launch is **remote**.
Precisely because any nuclear-weapon possessor recognizes the vast
gravity of any launch,]{.underline} [release sequences have many steps,
and human decision is repeatedly interposed as well as capping the
sequences.]{.underline} [To convey that because a first
step]{.underline} was prompted [the world]{.underline} somehow [came
close to accidental nuclear war is **wild hyperbole**, rather like
asserting, when a tennis champion has lost his opening service game,
that he was nearly beaten in straight sets]{.underline}. [History anyway
scarcely offers any ready example of major war started by accident even
before the nuclear revolution imposed an **order-of-magnitude** increase
in caution.]{.underline} It was occasionally conjectured that nuclear
war might be triggered by the real but accidental or [unauthorized
launch]{.underline} of a strategic nuclear-weapon delivery system in the
direction of a potential adversary. No such launch is known to have
occurred in over sixty years. [The probability]{.underline} of it
[is]{.underline} therefore [very low. [But **even if it did**]{.mark}
happen, the **[further]{.mark} hypothesis** of its initiating a [general
**nuclear exchange**]{.mark} is far-fetched. It **[fails to
consider]{.mark} the [real]{.mark} situation of
[decision-makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as pages 63-4 have brought out.
[The notion that cosmic holocaust might be mistakenly precipitated in
this way belongs to science fiction.]{.underline}

\*added \[overlooked\]

With dozens of treaty allies and a strategic priority of promoting the
sovereignty of weak states, [the U.S. **[military]{.mark}** has been
gradually **[shifting]{.mark}** from a force designed for confrontation
[to]{.mark} one intended to promote international
**cooperation**]{.underline}. To be sure, the U.S. military retains a
technical and doctrinal advantage as a warfighting entity. However, over
the past two decades, the military has been incorporating new
organizations, doctrine, and training to prioritize efforts to prevent
war [through **[security]{.mark} force
[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has shifted focus to weak
states where sub-national (e.g., gangs in Central America) and
trans-national security challenges (e.g., al-Qa'ida) jeopardize
sovereignty and regional stability.1 Consequently, countries such as the
Philippines, Georgia, Colombia, Uganda, and Pakistan have requested
security assistance from the United States. While level of support
varies, U.S. forces are enabling partner countries to combat challenges
that threaten their own stability.

[This shift in focus has **raised concerns** about the
"**militarization** of U.S. **fo**reign **po**licy,"]{.underline} which
began in the 1990s with the recognition that combatant commanders are as
much policy entrepreneurs as they are war fighters.2 Generals like Tony
Zinni or Wesley Clark epitomized the new breed of warrior-diplomat who
directly engaged with foreign heads of state.3 Far from rogue generals,
these military leaders were directed by President Bill Clinton to engage
with the world and promote security by assisting partners and assuring
allies in a security environment freed from the Cold War dynamic.
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama continued the
practice of using the military to assist almost every government of the
world. As Administrations from both parties came to value the military's
capabilities in peace and war, [some contended that defense overshadowed
(if not displaced) traditional diplomacy and development
efforts]{.underline}.4 Within defense circles, [[critics assumed]{.mark}
that helping weak states **[jeopardized]{.mark}** American [**military
dominance** and **undercut preparations for major
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 More recently, [critics highlight that in
an era of declining budgets, the]{.underline} United States [military
cannot afford nor overcome **unintended consequences** of attempting to
be a "global force for good."]{.underline}6 These are valid concerns,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States shows no signs of
retreating from a global leadership role and instead seeks partnerships
as a key component of U.S. strategy.

With shared challenges of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and
shared goals of development and protecting human security, there are
unprecedented levels of international cooperation to share information,
target terrorists, and provide governments the tools they need to
confront national threats before they become regional ones. This is on
display in Afghanistan where 50 countries operate under the ISAF flag,
or in the Indian Ocean where 27 countries operate as Combined Maritime
Forces. At the center of the coalitions is a U.S.-sponsored framework to
enable partners to contribute to international security.

President Barack Obama intends to continue the American tradition of
enabling partners throughout the globe. As he noted in his second
inaugural address, "America will remain the anchor of strong alliances
in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that
extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. For no one has a greater
stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation." [By [training
and equipping]{.mark} other militaries, the goal is to **reduce** U.S.
American **military presence internationally** and]{.underline} allow
others to provide for their own security. [This [has **positive
benefits**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only for the U.S. defense budget
(e.g., an Afghan soldier costs hundreds per month compared to an
American soldier who costs thousands per month), but also [[for
**international security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While my earlier book
Exporting Security explains why the United States assists governments
from Afghanistan to Zambia, an overlooked area is security assistance
provided to developed countries.

CAPACITY MATTERS

As France recently learned in Mali, while it has capable ground forces
and aircraft, it has limited ability to sustain these forces just 2,000
miles from home. To support its foreign policy agenda, France needed the
United States Air Force to fly its forces and refuel its attack
aircraft. As the operation continues, the United States will probably
provide intelligence for French and African forces as they shift to
stability operations.

Counterterrorism can certainly explain U.S. intervention in Mali;
however, enabling French success explains the timeline. More
importantly, the case of U.S.-supported French intervention in Mali is
illustrative of the role the United States plays in supporting developed
countries. France is the latest developed country to need U.S.
assistance, but requests like this are common. This is true for almost
every one of the 50 countries serving in Afghanistan today, as it was
true with European countries in the Balkans, Australian forces in East
Timor, and British forces in West Africa. These examples highlight that
the foreign policy goals of many developed countries exceed their
military capacity, which requires them to rely on the U.S. military for
assistance. As developed countries' defense budgets fall further,
reliance on the United States is going to increase. This remains a
decades-old frustration. Most recently, the NATO Secretary General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, "There is a lower limit on how little we can
spend on defense, while living up to our responsibilities.\"7

Pragmatically, the United States would like its partners to do more, but
shared challenges and limited budgets will reinforce the value of
American logistics, combat experience, and intelligence capacity.
Further, American support of other countries reinforces the treaty
arrangements with 27 NATO countries and five Asian countries. Twenty
years ago, there seemed to be little relevance to these treaties and
security arrangements, let alone a rationale for invoking them or
expanding them. Yet, the opposite occurred. NATO increased its
membership three times from 16 to 19 in 1999, again to 26 in 2006, and
again to 28 in 2009. At the same time the number of NATO members
increased, NATO changed from its traditional mission of territorial
defense to one of global security engagement. With each expansion, new
members require training and equipping to NATO standards. With each new
operation, NATO countries require access to U.S. intelligence, critical
technology, and global logistics.

In addition to formal treaties of alliance, an additional dozen
countries are offered protection under the U.S. security umbrella either
by law, such as the Taiwan Relations Act or by policy such as United
States' support for Israel.8 These protections include provisions to
train and equip their militaries. Another dozen countries are offered
special security provisions through Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status.
MNNA does not confer a mutual defense relationship, but the largely
symbolic act implies a close working relationship with another
country\'s defense forces.9 It is more akin to a preferred buyer's
program allowing countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea access
to advanced weapons systems. With weapons purchases also come long-term
training and maintenance contracts. From a U.S. perspective, it has a
comparative advantage in defense exports; strategically, programs like
these are intended to overcome the free-rider problem the United States
faces with its partners.10 For every Joint Strike Fighter Japan buys,
the United States can deploy one less to northeast Asia.

Given the diplomatic nature of these security partnerships, the
Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs focuses these
activities, regulates the defense trade and arms transfers to reinforce
the military capabilities of friends, allies, and coalition partners,
and ensures that the transfer of U.S.-origin defense equipment and
technology supports U.S. national security interests. Further, the
Bureau promotes regional security through bilateral and multilateral
cooperation and dialogue, as well as through the provision of security
assistance to friendly countries and international peacekeeping efforts.
The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military balances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to Saudi
Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., South Korea), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old FARC insurgency). Historically, Israel has been
the largest recipient of security assistance and its neighbor Egypt
benefited from its recognition of Israel and the Camp David Accords.11
Given its proximity to the United States and challenges with drug
trafficking organizations, Mexico has recently emerged as a top
recipient of security assistance. Given the history of American military
interventions in Mexico, this has required new efforts to build trust to
reassure the government that it seeks to strengthen it and not undermine
it.12

One reason the United States concentrates assistance on just a few
countries is to promote particular countries as regional leaders. In
practice, this means that Jordan hosts an international special
operations exercise, peace operations training center, and an
international police training center. Or in Latin America, Colombia
provides helicopter training for regional militaries and El Salvador
hosts a regional peacekeeping institute, attracting military personnel
from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Given the significant
U.S. investment in Afghanistan's military and police training
infrastructure, it is likely that Afghanistan could eventually host
regional training if the insurgency subsides to acceptable levels. [This
approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also **reduces** the
need for American **presence** and the **negative attention** it
sometimes generates]{.underline}. We see the benefits of this today
where U.S.-trained Colombian pilots are training Mexican pilots in
Colombia.

**\[Table 1: Top Recipients of U.S. International Assistance (Account
150) OMITTED\]**

In addition to the Department of State budget for security assistance,
the [**Defense** Department]{.underline} directly funds security
assistance through section 1206/7 and other command funds such as
Commander's Emergency Response Program. This [**authority** did provoke
more **concern** about **militarizing fo**reign **po**licy; **however**,
this **only** makes up]{.underline} about \$1 billion annually, which is
[**less than 15 percent** of **security assistance** funded by the
**State** Department. Further, U.S. **ambassadors must approve all
programs**]{.underline}. Thus, [the Department of **State exerts
considerable control of programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels** through the embassy country team]{.underline}.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE MILITARY

With national security focused on weak states and persistent security
concerns among stable allies like South Korea, the U.S. military has
been changing over the last 20 years from a force of confrontation to
one of cooperation. [The military has learned that partnership is better
than clientism and is adapting its command structure once optimized for
waging major combat to one that is focused on conflict prevention.
[There is **still a tremendous warfighting capability** in the U.S.
military, but **coalition warfare is the norm** and
**developing**]{.mark} **compatible [warfighting partners]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} a **[key]{.mark}** goal of this cooperative
strategy]{.underline}. In some sense, [this **turns the idea of
militarization of fo**reign **po**licy **on its head**; the Pentagon is
**being demilitarized** and valued for its ability to impart military
capabilities to U.S. partners]{.underline}.

Given the current structure of the international system and
technological advances, the United States does not need partners in the
same way as it did in the past where they provided direct benefits
through coaling stations, maintenance facilities, or large bases. While
the number of forward bases is still substantial, the number of forward
deployed forces are greatly reduced. More importantly, the nature of the
presence has changed; the United States aspires to create true partners
that can confront their own threats to internal stability (e.g.,
assistance to Colombia's military) or alleviate security dilemmas (e.g.,
future basing in Australia). It also seeks to foster independence by
training and equipping militaries to support the global demand for
peacekeepers.14 The United States certainly gets increased access to
countries around the world through these programs, but given the
overwhelming military dominance of the United States, it does not abuse
these relationships or ignore seemingly insignificant states. Instead,
it seeks to create partners where sovereignty is respected and all
parties derive benefits. The latest example of this is U.S. withdrawal
from Iraq as dictated by a U.S.-Iraqi agreement.

[While the Defense Department's capacity certainly explains why
international assistance missions **increasingly have a military face**,
it is also essential to understand that **there is a global demand** for
U.S. security assistance. The **Defense** Department **has recognized
that there are limits to what it can do**; the military **wants** and
needs **partners** from **across** the **government**, **allies** and
**private organizations**. Unfortunately, these ideas
remain]{.underline} stunted [\[**overlooked**\] in the broader foreign
policy community that gets **easily overwhelmed by the size of the
Defense Department's resources**. For critics, U.S. military activities
in permissive environments bring old memories of invasion or coup. For
them, U.S. foreign policy is on a dangerous militarization
path]{.underline}. While that part of U.S. military history is real and
still resonates in many parts of the world, [[it is **wrong**]{.mark} to
overlook the changes that have occurred over the last two decades.
Further, it is wrong to overlook the significant demands developed
countries place on the United States]{.underline}.

#### No impact to readiness

**George 99** James L. George, former congressional professional staff
member for national security affairs, "Is Military Readiness Overrated?"
CATO, 5-27-1999,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/is-military-readiness-overrated>
/GoGreen!

Military readiness promises to be a major issue when Congress marks up a
defense bill later this year. Some members of Congress are already using
readiness as a reason to increase funding in the emergency spending bill
for the war in Yugoslavia. Most experts cite the initial stages of the
Korean War and the Hollow Force of the late 1970s as cautionary examples
of being ill-prepared. A closer look at both those examples, however,
shows that they really had little to do with readiness. Moreover, the
current crisis in Yugoslavia illustrates once again why
[[readiness]{.mark} may be **[overrated]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
funds better spent elsewhere. Although [often **used as a generic term**
for all military capabilities]{.underline}, readiness---defined as the
ability to respond with appropriate force with little or no warning---is
only one of four pillars of military preparedness. The other pillars are
force structure, modernization and sustainability. Thus, [an effective
military force [depends on **much more**]{.mark} than just
readiness]{.underline}. Interestingly, [the two favorite examples cited
by readiness [alarmists **fail to prove their
case**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The performance of [Task Force
Smith]{.underline}, an ill-prepared battalion quickly sent to the front
and fairly [easily routed by the North Koreans]{.underline} during the
initial days of the Korean War, is often cited as the worst case. "No
More Task Force Smiths" has become a mantra for the Army. However,
critics of Task Force Smith fail to point out that U.S. commanders made
the most basic of military mistakes---including grossly underestimating
the enemy and sending TFS to an exposed position. When such blunders
occur, the end result will be the same whether it is an ill-trained Task
Force Smith in Korea or well-trained Marines in Beirut or elite Rangers
in Somalia. [Moreover, critics also fail to mention that barely a month
later the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [stabilized the
situation in South Korea]{.underline}, and in another month the Marines
conducted their famous Inchon Landing. In fact, without the Chinese
intervention, the United States would have won the Korean War a few
months after it began. Not bad for a U.S. force that was supposedly
ill-prepared. [Similarly, the Hollow Force of the late 1970s was not
primarily a readiness problem but a combination of many
factors---including]{.underline} a military characterized by low morale
after Vietnam, [serious **drug** and **racial problems**, the erroneous
induction of too many mentally **substandard recruits** and **low pay**
eroded further by high inflation]{.underline}. At the same time, [major
structural changes]{.underline} were transforming the U.S. military,
including the introduction of women into the regular forces, [the switch
from a draft to an all-volunteer force and the initiation of the Total
Force Concept that placed more reliance on the Reserves]{.underline}.
Given all of that turbulence, no wonder we had a Hollow Force. [**Often
[overlooked]{.mark}**, however, is **[how quickly]{.mark} those
[problems were solved]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In some cases, solutions
were found without spending a dime. For example, Chief of Naval
Operations Adm. Thomas Hayward instituted his "Not in my Navy" program
of zero tolerance for drugs. The drug problem was solved almost
overnight. The induction of too many mentally substandard recruits by
mistake which had lowered standards, was identified and corrected. That
correction solved most other personnel problems (and should be a warning
to people who want to lower standards today). Some members of Congress
are now using the crisis in Yugoslavia to get more funds for readiness
by arguing that the military is now stretched "too thin." (Congress
doubled President Clinton's request for \$6 billion in emergency
spending for the war.) In fact, the situation is quite the opposite.
[Leaving aside the question of whether the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should even be involved]{.underline} in
Yugoslavia, the new Clinton Doctrine, which does not plan to use ground
troops ( a position that is supported by many Republicans), limits the
stress placed on the military. Those [[decisions are]{.mark} all
deliberate [political actions that **have absolutely nothing to do with
readiness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Under a well-conceived strategy, even
a modestly capable force will probably perform well; but under a
**poorly conceived strategy**, even a force with the highest degree of
readiness will probably have serious problems]{.underline}. The
experiences of Task Force Smith and the Hollow Force, as well as the
invocation of a Clinton Doctrine that eschews the use of ground forces,
have major implications. More forces, for example, could be placed in
the reserves and scarce funds spent elsewhere. In addition, the military
could switch to what Sen. John McCain (R- Ariz.) has called "Tiered
Readiness:" a few forces would be kept on expensive ready status and be
augmented by reserve forces that could be mobilized if a substantial
threat to U.S. security arose. Military readiness is certainly
important, and no one is suggesting a return to the truly shallow force
of the late 1940s or the Hollow Force of the 1970s. But a close look at
those forces shows that their difficulties involved much more than just
poor readiness.

#### No impact to readiness

Other Problems,\" in The Stupidity of War: American Foreign Policy and
the Case for Complacency, Chapter 7, 02/17/2021, pg. 183-184.

Over the course of the last several decades,
[[alarmists]{.underline}]{.mark} have [often [focus]{.mark}ed
[on]{.mark} potential dangers presented by]{.underline} **[[rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as they came to be called in the 1990s.
These were led by such devils du jour as Nasser, Sukarno, Castro,
Gaddafi, Khomeini, Kim Il-sung, Saddam Hussein, Milosˇevic´, and
Ahmadinijad, [[all]{.mark} of whom have since]{.underline} **[[faded
into history's dustbin]{.underline}]{.mark}**.66 Today [the alarm has
been directed at]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}** as discussed in
Chapter 6 [and]{.underline} also at **[North Korea]{.underline}** as
discussed in this one. However, [neither country really threatens to
commit]{.underline} **[major direct military aggression]{.underline}**.
[Iran]{.underline}, in fact, has **[eschewed]{.underline}** [the
practice for several centuries]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, it might make some sense to maintain a capacity to
institute containment and deterrence efforts carried out in formal or
informal coalition with concerned neighboring countries -- and there are
quite a few of these in each case. However, the [**[military
requirements]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[effective]{.underline} **[[containment]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by their
neighbors]{.underline}, by [the United States, and]{.underline} by [the
broader world community are far from monumental and]{.underline} **[[do
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily [**[require]{.underline}** [the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to
maintain]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[large
forces]{.underline}**]{.mark}-in-being [for the remote]{.underline}
[eventuality]{.underline}.

This is suggested by the experience with the Gulf War of 1991 when
military force was successfully applied to deal with a rogue venture --
the conquest by Saddam Hussein's Iraq of neighboring Kuwait. As noted
earlier, Iraq's invasion was rare to the point of being unique: it was
the only case since World War II in which one United Nations country has
invaded another with the intention of incorporating it into its own
territory. It scarcely appears, as laid out in Chapter 3, that Iraq's
pathetic forces required a large force to be thrown at them to decide to
withdraw: over a period of half a year, they did not erect anything
resembling an effective defensive system and, when the chips were down,
they proved to lack not only defenses, but strategy, tactics,
leadership, and morale as well.

[Countries]{.underline} **[opposed]{.underline}** [to provocative rogue
behavior do not need to have a]{.underline} **[large
force-in-being]{.underline}** [because there would be]{.underline}
[**[plenty of time]{.underline}** [to build]{.underline}]{.mark} [one
[up]{.mark}]{.underline} (should it come to that)
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} other measures such as **[economic
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[diplomatic
forays]{.underline}**]{.mark} (including appeasement) [[fail]{.mark} to
persuade]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- Capacity

#### No [capacity]{.underline} -- and their personnel reform plank just means incompetent contractors

firm, "U.S. Security Cooperation Review," February 2016,

Title 10 vs. Title 22. [[State **perceives** authority to have
shifted]{.mark} in]{.underline} two basic
[[ways]{.underline}]{.mark}: 1) **[new DoD authorities]{.underline}**
(i.e. 2282) [[that **undercut State's lead**]{.mark} **responsibility**
for security assistance planning, and]{.underline} 2) [new DoD
authorities that extend beyond assistance to "armed forces," whereby DoD
now has authority to train **non-security forces**]{.underline}.
Generally speaking, [Defense sees this as [a **necessary**
evolution]{.mark} of the security assistance system [given]{.mark} the
[shifting]{.mark} nature of **[global threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Specifically, Defense sees Title 22 authorities as diplomatic in nature,
focused on relationship building as they have always been. By contrast,
[DoD sees the new Title 10 authorities as **[critical to filling real
capability gaps]{.mark}** that have a direct connection to U.S. national
security interests]{.underline}. Moreover, they cite, [[in a time
of]{.underline}]{.mark} significant budget constraints, increasing
pressure and need to rely on partners and coalitions in this way.
Finally, a very real connection exists between Title 10 and Title 22
authority growth and the relative level of activity (or inactivity)
between the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees. State has not
seen an authorizations bill in a decade, and the evolution of their
authorities has not kept pace with the evolution of Defense committees.
Many of the State authorities are relatively outdated, but their
committees have not been successful in moving State authorization
legislation through the system. Finally, and [above all, Defense
continues to stress the **[pragmatic urgency]{.mark}** of the current
situation, [and **State's inability**]{.mark} (due to lack of resources,
not incompetence) [to do **industrial scale security
coop**]{.mark}**eration** work]{.underline}. For instance, [Defense
personnel typically concede that it is undesirable for U.S. military
forces to be training civilian security personnel, but that [this is
**better than it not being done**, or]{.mark} the training being **[done
by incompetent contractors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### DoS [internal turf wars]{.underline} gut solvency and thump the net benefit -- and reforms won't solve

/GoGreen!

**[[Who's in charge?]{.underline}]{.mark}** As the Obama administration
issued and then sought to implement Presidential Policy Directive 23 on
security sector assistance, and [as DoD's security assistance profile
has grown in recent years, debates both within and outside the
government have recently been asking the "who's in charge" question from
an interagency perspective]{.underline}. [Yet, the question
is]{.underline} equally---and perhaps
**[[more]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[**[important inside]{.mark}** the
**[State]{.mark}** Department itself]{.underline}.

[Responsibility for [**security assistance** is]{.mark} **muddled** and
**[disjointed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs (PM) leads a planning process]{.underline} around FMF and
International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs, [but the
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources makes final decisions about
funding allocations, and **[regional]{.mark} bureaus** exercise
substantial influence on how resources are divvied up within their
assigned regions]{.underline}. PM's power can seem to range somewhere
between facilitation [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} administration.

[Complicating matters further, other **[functional
bureaus]{.mark}**]{.underline}---such as the International Narcotics and
Law Enforcement Bureau and the Bureau for International Security and
Nonproliferation---[[control]{.mark} significant security assistance
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as program funding under the
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) and the
Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR)
accounts. Yet another major aid program, the Peacekeeping Operations
(PKO) account, is controlled by regional bureaus.

[[Developing **integrated**]{.mark}**, holistic [plans]{.mark}** for
**security assistance** across all these bureaus, which all report to
different undersecretaries, [is]{.mark} nearly
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are numerous countries in
which four or five different security assistance programs may be
[funding activities in the same general area (for example, maritime
security) [with]{.mark} **[competing objectives]{.mark}** and **[limited
awareness]{.mark}** of other activities]{.underline}. And, in the
current organization, [there is **[no one]{.mark}** sufficiently
empowered [to **arbitrate conflicts**]{.mark} between
bureaus]{.underline} below the level of deputy secretary, the #2
official in the department.

Even as the Trump administration considers major reforms to the State
Department bureaucracy, [this muddle is **[not expected to
improve]{.mark}** considerably. Disjointed, uncoordinated programming
[risks **strategic failure**, **redundancy**, and **waste**]{.mark}; the
question of who's in charge thus becomes critically
important]{.underline}. The committee would do well to press State
Department leaders to begin sorting out the answer.

America spends billions each year on **[[security
coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** and assistance programs, but the
results do not match the investment. To help improve efficiencies, [the
Center for American Progress recently proposed
**[consolidating]{.mark}** all these programs [within]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department]{.underline}.

[That would be [a **big mistake**]{.mark}, because it [would **minimize
the Pentagon's role**]{.mark} in shaping and directing security
assistance and]{.underline}, ultimately, the program's [[**military**
objectives]{.mark} would be **[subordinated]{.mark}** to State
Department interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and
humanitarian programs. Those are not the values by which such security
assistance programs should be solely judged.

Security sector assistance programs deliver arms, military training, and
other defense-related services to allies and partner nation governments
via grants, loans, credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these
programs [should **prioritize**]{.mark} national
**security**]{.underline}. To this end, reforms should enhance joint
State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in terms of
America's national strategic goals.

In the existing system, State consults with Defense on its security
assistance designs. Defense then implements State programs, as well as
its own security cooperation programs, such as multinational military
exercises and military training and advising.

The departments differ in the scope to which they apply security
assistance. [**Defense** programs target **[narrower]{.mark}** national
**[security objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the Maritime
Security Initiative, launched in 2015 to expand maritime domain
awareness. [**[State]{.mark}**'s programs]{.underline}, such as the
Central America Regional Security Initiative, [[emphasize]{.mark}
broader]{.underline} regional stability and **[[humanitarian
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Assistance programs can be better tailored to their objectives when
State shares directive authority and decision-making power with the
entity most relevant to each program's purpose]{.underline}. For
example, [[when the **objective** is **military
capacity-building**]{.mark}, the Defense Department should be an equal
partner]{.underline}; when the goal is justice system reform, the
Department of Justice should be a full partner.

Consider how the Philippines used American-sourced coast guard cutters
when responding to China's intrusions at Whitsun Reef earlier this year.
Given President Biden's emphasis on strategic competition with China,
strengthening partner nations to resist Beijing's maritime coercion
should be a no-brainer. In this context, State should ensure it ties the
objectives of its weapons sales program to Defense Department
priorities, such as improving maritime domain awareness, by enabling the
Philippines and, perhaps other countries, to increase patrols of
exclusive economic zones.

Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance in the Middle East
should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to military effects.
However, the report's recommendations are limited to counterterrorism
activities and a strategy of deprioritizing the Middle East in favor of
the Indo-Pacific. If [**[limiting]{.mark}** security assistance [to
**military purposes**]{.mark} would **[make programs more
effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a region of waning emphasis, it
stands to reason that [this should be the formative basis for all
security assistance programs]{.underline}, especially when strategy
calls for increased investment in the security capacities of partner
nations.

[Reforms to security assistance should push]{.underline} the agencies in
this direction, encouraging --- or compelling --- [State to design its
programs in closer coordination with the Pentagon and [in support
of]{.mark} Defense Department's **[operational needs]{.mark}**, such as
improving military forward presence, wartime [**resilience** and
**interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Congress should recognize and re-evaluate its role in these decision as
well, as legislative earmarks can limit State's directive agility and
responsiveness. But even the best-laid plans cannot succeed without
follow-through.

The relatively newly created Section 333 train and equip authority,

security force reform to the State Department, including the Afghanistan

fund

[This would result in a roughly \$7 billion transfer]{.underline},
significantly augmenting the State Department's budget and capacity to
