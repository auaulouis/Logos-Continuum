**[Defining Security Cooperation]{.underline}**28

[**Security Cooperation** is a]{.underline} Department of Defense
(**[DOD]{.underline}**) [term that refers to "...**all DOD
interactions** with foreign defense establishments]{.underline} to:

• Build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests;

• Develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
coalition operations, including allied transformation;

• Improve information exchange and intelligence sharing to harmonize
views on security challenges; and

• Provide U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access and en route
infrastructure."29

**[Security Cooperation is not the same as Security
Assistance]{.underline}**. [The latter term refers **only** to
programs]{.underline} such as Foreign Military Financing (FMF), Foreign
Military Sales (FMS), the International Military Education and Training
Program (IMET), and other programs [governed by the Foreign Assistance
Act and managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. The
Department of **State** plays a **key role** in **providing policy
direction** for **Security Assistance** programs]{.underline}.
[**Security Cooperation** is a **much broader** term that, **in addition
to Security Assistance**, includes such categories of activities as
combined **exercises**, combined **training**, combined **education**,
**mil**itary-to-**mil**itary **contacts**, humanitarian assistance, and
**info**rmation **op**erations]{.underline}.30 It also refers to the
planning process DOD organizations use to implement these activities.

In essence, the Security Cooperation planning process is a systematic
method for translating strategic guidance into programmatic objectives.
The Office of the Secretary of Defense issues annual Security
Cooperation Guidance (OSD SCG) to guide the planning and activities of
Unified and Specified Commands, the military services, and other DOD
agencies and actors.31 The SCG promulgates strategic objectives based on
security themes derived from the National Security and Defense
strategies. It also provides regional and country priorities,
objectives, and measures of effectiveness for assessment.32 The Unified
and Specified Commands, the services, and other DOD players develop
subordinate plans to execute Security Cooperation activities in support
of OSD's objectives. The Unified Commands, for example, develop regional
strategies and country plans to guide the implementation of security
cooperation activities in their Areas of Operation.33

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 The OSD SCG directs
that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with other elements of
national power...in order to achieve national security, defense, and
foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation, while helpful, obscures
two key facts. First, Security Cooperation includes activities that by
their very nature involve the simultaneous application of more than one
element of national power. Security Cooperation at a minimum requires
the combination of diplomatic relations, military assistance,
military-to-military contacts, and public diplomacy. In other words,
Security Cooperation is itself an application of at least three of the
classic elements of national power.36 Second, [**DOD is not the only
entity** in the USG that interacts with foreign governments to achieve
the stated objectives: relationships, capabilities, information and
intelligence, and access. The Department of **State**, the
**I**ntelligence **C**ommunity, and to a lesser extent, **other
departments and agencies**, conduct activities aimed at the
accomplishment of these objectives, broadly understood]{.underline}.
**[There is]{.underline}**, however, [**no common USG**, or interagency,
**definition**]{.underline} or concept [of **Security
Cooperation**]{.underline}.37 We will return to this issue in the final
section of this paper. For the purposes of the present discussion, [this
paper offers the following working **definition of Security
Cooperation:**]{.underline}

> [**Security Cooperation** refers to **all USG assistance** provided to
> **foreign law enforcement, security, and defense establishments** in
> support of national defense, security, and foreign policy
> objectives]{.underline}.**[38]{.underline}**

[This **expanded definition** of Security Cooperation]{.underline} will
[help us to see how the USG may leverage its programs and activities to
fight terrorism and related non-state threats]{.underline}.

The role of Security Cooperation in countering non-state threats is
clearly reflected in U.S. strategy. The NSS states that the U.S. will
cooperate with nations to counter terrorism and WMD proliferation,
assisting those that are willing but unable, and persuading those that
are able but not willing.39 The National Military Strategy (NMS)
develops the concept of forward defense, or "Countering Threats Close to
Their Source."40 This is the recognition that the United States' first
line of defense is abroad, and that it is necessary to "patrol strategic
approaches" and extend U.S. defensive capabilities beyond our borders to
create an active "defense in depth."41 [In this context, Security
Cooperation is best understood as a set of tools that can shape the
strategic battlespace by creating the conditions necessary to accomplish
U.S. security and defense objectives]{.underline}.42 As the NMS's focus
on forward defense indicates, these activities are by their nature
anticipatory, preparatory, and defensive.43 They are best used as part
of a long-term comprehensive strategy to put in place the relationships,
capabilities, information and intelligence, and access to facilitate
future offensive and defensive actions to counter non-state, as well as
more traditional, threats.

**\[FOOTNOTE 38\]**

**[38]{.underline}** The [application of the **Security Cooperation**
paradigm to the **entire USG** **requires a precise definition of
security**]{.underline}. [**Defined too broadly, Security Cooperation
would simply be a surrogate for foreign policy**. **Limiting** the
objectives to **specific enumerated** defense]{.underline} and security
[**objectives** and assistance to foreign establishments playing a role
in national security or defense is **necessary to circumscribe the issue
adequately**]{.underline}.

### SC = DoD Everything

#### Congress defines "security cooperation" as authorized, funded AND administered by DoD -- agencies each have their own, contradictory interpretations

A. "Security Sector Assistance" as an Umbrella Term

[The]{.underline} foundational and initial [task of
defining]{.underline} "security sector assistance" and the related terms
["security assistance" and "security cooperation" is not simple, with
**different** **branches** and **agencies** of the **U.S. government**
**defining** and applying **the terms differently**]{.underline}. [This
can **make it difficult to coherently discuss** the **respective
responsibilities** of the various executive **agencies**]{.underline} or
identify where TCA ends and statutory authorities begin.

As a starting point, presidential policy, defined "security sector
assistance" as any U.S. Government "policy, program, \[or\] activity"
used to:

Engage with foreign partners and help shape their policies and actions
in the security sector;

Help foreign partners build and sustain the capacity and effectiveness
of legitimate institutions to provide security, safety, and justice for
their people; \[or\],

Enable foreign partners to contribute to efforts that address common
security challenges. 129

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition, 130 encompasses DoS programs, but not
DoD or other executive agency programs. 131 In addition, [**Congress**
has **defined "security cooperation"** as **DoD specific**]{.underline},
132 [but it has **not defined "security assistance."**]{.underline}

The **[DoD]{.underline}** adheres to the presidential policy definition
and further [defines "security cooperation" as all its relationship
building and foreign partner development activities, including "security
assistance," which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation
that is funded and authorized by the DoS and administered by the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency]{.underline}. 133 [The **DoS**, on the other
hand, uses the term "security assistance" in a manner that **contradicts
the DoD's definition**]{.underline}, employing it to describe any DoS or
DoD assistance to foreign military or other security forces. 134

[To synthesize these definitions]{.underline}, and **[consistent
with]{.underline}** presidential **[policy]{.underline}**, this article
uses [the term "security sector assistance"]{.underline} to [mean:
(**1**) **DoS approved, funded, and administered "security
assistance;"** (**2**) **DoD approved, funded, and administered
"security cooperation;"** and (**3**) **hybrid security
assistance/cooperation**, **approved and funded by the DoS**, **but
administered by the DoD**]{.underline}. 135

The What, Why, and How of Security Assistance

[**"Security assistance"** refers to a specific set of programs
authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act and Arms Export Control
Act]{.underline}. These programs are [overseen by the **State
Department**]{.underline} in cooperation with the Department of Defense.
[**"Security cooperation"** describes separately authorized **Defense
Department**-led activities]{.underline} such as "global train and
equip" programs. The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which has
provided military aid to that country since 2016, is one such example of
these programs run by the Pentagon. I will use the more common term
here, security assistance, in reference to either type. When security
assistance works well, it gives partner nations the tools to address
internal instability and deter and defend against external adversaries,
reducing the likelihood that direct U.S. intervention will be called for
in the future. It also helps to ensure that the United States maintains
access, basing, and overflight privileges, strengthens interoperability,
and accrues the less tangible benefit of military-to-military personal
relationships.

#### It excludes other agencies

Department of Defense (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [**security cooperation**
activities]{.underline} support or are combined with other assistance
programs and often [are a part of nation assistance]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} often occurs in a manner that [may **appear
confusing** or convoluted]{.underline} to the joint warfighter. This
article portrays how the programs and activities converge. [Although the
various **terms** and activities in show in the accompanying figure
**appear** to have **simple names and meanings**, they **in fact** have
**strict definitions based on funding and authorities**]{.underline}.
While some of the activities directly support one another, others [have
**distinct boundaries** between their definitions and
functions]{.underline}. The joint community is beginning to address the
framework of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication,
Joint Publication (JP) 3-XX, Security Cooperation. [It is **important**
to embark with **clear definitions** and understanding of the complex
relationship among these terms to **facilitate
understanding**]{.underline} by the joint force.

![Security Cooperation
Framework](media/image1.jpeg){width="3.6956517935258093in"
height="2.5955358705161853in"}

Security cooperation is referred to in both joint professional military
education programs and joint staffs as a tool to be employed by
combatant commands. However, in other settings, it is a set of programs
managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of
joint doctrine and policy reveals that the definition of security
cooperation appears to encompass these areas and more. After expanding
our understanding of security cooperation, other terms such as security
force assistance, foreign internal defense, and security assistance
provide additional specificity for the tasks being conducted, yet some
of these actions fall outside security cooperation. [Even though
**security cooperation** spans the range of military operations and is
inclusive of large-scale operations conducted in support of foreign
nations, it is **not** all-encompassing of security related support from
U.S. **agencies other than DOD**]{.underline}.

Nation assistance is support rendered by foreign forces within another
nation's territory based on mutual agreements.1 While this term is used
to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other nations, the
definition associated with nation assistance has two limitations: it
does not encompass support to regional organizations, and it is only
assistance by foreign forces. A better, broader term is foreign
assistance, which is assistance to foreign nations ranging from the sale
of military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
survivors of natural and manmade disasters.2 When examining the current
definitions for foreign assistance and nation assistance, we find
significant overlap:

Foreign assistance to foreign nations \[ranges\] from the sale of
military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign assistance
takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance, and
security assistance.3

This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance
budget.

Nation assistance---assistance rendered to a nation by foreign forces
within that nation's territory based on agreements mutually concluded
between nations.4

The term nation assistance is not often used in policy or strategy. For
example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign
assistance three times but does not use the term nation assistance. The
first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term nation
assistance with foreign assistance in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0,
Joint Operations, and JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.

If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint
doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security
cooperation that falls outside the realm of nation assistance in
figure 1. [Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security
cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. **Security cooperation**
then **focuses strictly on the DOD contribution** to foreign assistance
and **encompasses all DOD interactions with foreign defense
establishments** to build both national and regional defense
relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests, develop
allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
contingency access to host nations]{.underline}.5

Having addressed the larger constructs, it is possible to review and
clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that
occur within them. First is [**security assistance** with a **specific
definition** in relation to both DOD and State. It refers to a group of
programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline} of 1961,
as amended, [and the Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} of 1976, as
amended. [These programs are **funded and authorized by State** to be
**administered by DOD** through the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency]{.underline}.6 This is the process by which the United States
provides defense articles, military training, and other defense-related
services. [That portion of **security assistance** **outside** of
**security cooperation**]{.underline} in figure 1 [reflects **State**
and other **civilian agency involvement**]{.underline}.

[Current doctrine states: "**Security cooperation** is the means by
which the Department of Defense encourages and enables countries and
organizations to work with us to achieve strategic
objectives."**16**]{.underline} The experience in the Global War on
Terrorism (GWOT) makes clear that the transnational nature of the
challenges the United States faces precludes achieving our strategic
objectives without the cooperation of allies and partners. To achieve
unity of effort, the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) proposes
that, "Whenever possible, the United States works with or through
others: enabling allied and partner capabilities, building their
capacity, and developing mechanisms to share the risks and
responsibilities of today's complex challenges."17 No one country can
solve GWOT problems; partnerships and cooperation with friendly nations
are essential to winning a "Long War" on terror.

**Introduction**

The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). At that time, the Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day-to-day management
responsibilities of many security assistance programs authorized by the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export Control Act (AECA).
The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain Department of Defense
(DoD)-funded international programs along with their personnel and
associated resources. In order for U.S. government (USG) agencies, the
private sector, and foreign governments to better understand DSAA's
enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security assistance (SA),
DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs while also leading the wider USG security
cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation programs
continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs), or the military
departments (MILDEPs). Further complicating the management of security
cooperation was the in-country point of contact between the USG and the
host nation. This point of contact was either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA)- sponsored Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or the
DSCA-sponsored Security Cooperation Office (SCO). These two spigots of
security cooperation within a country required a broad knowledge and
skill baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD, its agencies and the
MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of in-country
security cooperation were generally resolved with the establishment of
the Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) having oversight
over both the SCO and DAO organizations.

On 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **formal**]{.underline}, yet still
very broad, [**definition** of **security cooperation** in]{.underline}
Joint Pub 1-02[:]{.underline}

> [All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation.

[**DODD 5132.03**, **DoD Policy** and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation]{.underline}, 29 December [2016, further **defines
security cooperation** with assigned responsibilities:]{.underline}

> [**All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments** to build
> defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests,
> develop allied and partner nation military and security capabilities
> for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to allied and partner nations.
> This **includes** **DoD-administered security assistance**
> programs]{.underline}.

[According to **Title 10 U.S. Code Section 301**, the term "**security
cooperation**]{.underline} programs and activities of the Department of
Defense" [means **any program, activity (including an exercise), or
interaction of the DoD with the security establishment of a foreign
country** to achieve a purpose as follows: (A) To build and develop
allied and friendly security capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations. (B) To provide the armed forces with access to
the foreign country during peacetime or a contingency operation. (C) To
build relationships that promote specific United States security
interests]{.underline}. Other DoD policy statements [identify
**DoD-**managed or **administered security assistance** programs as
**components of security cooperation**]{.underline}.

The purpose of this first chapter is to [**provide definitions** of the
various programs within **security assistance** and the **broader area**
of **security cooperation**]{.underline}.

#### Who administers, NOT who oversees, is the bright-line

Finally, [in the U.S. government, **"security cooperation"** and
**"security assistance"**]{.underline}---which are the chief lines of
effort in the U.S. toolkit to help partners bolster their security and
work with the United States to support common security
objectives---[are]{.underline} overlapping but **[not]{.underline}**
necessarily **[interchangeable]{.underline}**. [The **distinction**
between **"security cooperation"** and **"security assistance"**
activities has to do with the **agency administering** the program: in
simplest terms, it is **either** an activity of the **D**epartment
**o**f **D**efense (**security cooperation**) **or** the **D**epartment
**o**f **S**tate (**security assistance**)]{.underline}.

DOD and the Department of State (DOS) have shared responsibility for
engaging with foreign partner militaries since the mid-twentieth
century, with the bulk of congressional security assistance funding
allocated to DOS. Any security assistance administered by DOD---whether
funded under Title 10 (Armed Services) or Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) of
the U.S. Code---is a "security cooperation" activity.21 After the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the legal framework for the
funding and administration of such activities evolved in response to
emerging threats. Congress increasingly granted funding and authorities
directly to DOD under Title 10 for security cooperation.22 Therefore,
while DOS security assistance programs can include DIB components, the
majority of DIB-specific programming is currently funded under and
implemented by the Department of Defense and is thus considered security
cooperation.

House Armed Services Committee Report 114-102, accompanying
[the]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Act
([NDAA]{.underline}) for Fiscal Year 2016 (H.R.1735), [includes a
provision for us to report on an inventory of DOD **security
cooperation** programs]{.underline} intended to build partner security
capabilities.3 [**DOD defines** these programs as **including
DOD-administered State security assistance** activities]{.underline}.
[According to DOD and State officials, no sanctioned U.S. government
inventory of security cooperation and security assistance efforts
exists]{.underline}.**[4]{.underline}** In this report, we provide a
fiscal year 2016 inventory of DOD security cooperation and State
security assistance efforts that may be used by the U.S. government to
build foreign partners' capacity to address security-related threats,
including each effort's name, description, associated legal authorities,
and agency involvement as required by the associated authorities. This
inventory includes efforts that have building partner capacity (BPC) to
address security-related threats as a primary goal as well as efforts
that may have BPC as an ancillary goal or effect.

**\[FOOTNOTE 4\]**

**[4]{.underline}** [Various government and nongovernment entities have
compiled lists of security cooperation efforts, including security
assistance efforts administered by]{.underline} the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency ([DSCA]{.underline}), [but **none of the lists** are
sanctioned by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy as
both **current** and **complete**]{.underline}.

**\[/FOOTNOTE 4\]**

[To develop an inventory of]{.underline} BPC **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** and security assistance [efforts, we reviewed
data, documents, and reports from DOD, State, RAND, and the
Congressional Research Service (CRS); conducted searches of laws; and
reviewed prior GAO reports. We interviewed DOD, State, RAND, and CRS
officials about their research on, and listings of, security
cooperation]{.underline} and security assistance [efforts]{.underline}
used for BPC [and the efforts' associated authorities; the methodologies
they used; and the limitations they encountered]{.underline}. The
efforts we selected for our inventory comprise what our sources referred
to as "programs," "subprograms," "tools," "funding accounts,"
"authorities," or "activities." We used "efforts" as the most inclusive
possible term, because the DOD and DOD-sponsored sources we consulted
used undefined and varying terminology---for example, sometimes using
terms such as "programs" and "activities" interchangeably and sometimes
including funds and the names of authorities---and because these sources
and [DOD officials did not provide DOD-sanctioned definitions of the
program and subprogram levels for security cooperation
programs]{.underline}. We broadly defined building partner capacity to
include efforts that were intended solely to build partner security
capacity as well as those that could have a partial or ancillary effect
on partner security capacity. For example, [we **included** **military
exercises**, **training**, and **equipment** as well as]{.underline}
BPC-related [**personnel exchanges** and **military
contacts**]{.underline}. [To focus our inventory on]{.underline} BPC
efforts to address [**security**-related threats, we **excluded**
efforts whose sole purpose was **humanitarian**, **health**,
**disaster**, or **development** assistance]{.underline}. To eliminate
duplicative and expired efforts, we compared the data we obtained from
these sources and reviewed associated authorities. We worked with DOD
and State officials to resolve any discrepancies, to add additional
efforts, and to group subefforts with overall efforts when the officials

TERMINOLOGY

[Discussions of U.S. Security Sector Assistance are often hampered by
confusion over **definitions** and terminology]{.underline}. This
[misunderstanding is improving, however, and a simple set of terms that
is becoming **increasingly utilized and accepted**
follows**:**]{.underline}

• Security Sector Assistance (SSA) is a modern umbrella term, codified
by Presidential Policy Directive 23 (PPD-23, below), which captures
aspects of both security assistance (State-led programs) and security
cooperation (Defense-led or -implemented) programs.

• Building Partner Capacity (BPC) is a modern term that refers to U.S.
efforts to enhance or create important capabilities within the military
and civilian institutions of a partner government. This term is broader
than security assistance, in that it can refer to non-security
assistance, but it is also narrower than security assistance, in that it
refers only to assistance designed to build real capability, which is a
subset of all security assistance.

• [**Security assistance** is a group of **State-led**
programs]{.underline} authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
as amended, and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, or
other related statutes by which the United States provides defense
articles, military training, and other defense-related services by
grant, loan, credit, or cash sales in furtherance of national policies
and objectives.

• [**Security cooperation** refers to activities undertaken by the
**Department of Defense**]{.underline} to encourage and enable
international partners to work with the United States to achieve
strategic objectives, which includes all DoD interactions with foreign
defense and security establishments, **[including all DoD-administered
security assistance programs]{.underline}**, that build defense and
security relationships and that promote specific U.S. security
interests, including all international armaments cooperation activities
and security assistance activities.

• Foreign internal defense is an older term referring to participation
by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action
programs taken by another government or other designated organization to
free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency,
terrorism, and other threats to its security.

• Security force assistance is a doctrinal term referring to DoD
activities that contribute to unified action by the USG to support the
development of the capacity and capability of foreign security forces
and their supporting institutions.

Of note, the U.S. military is updating its formal lexicon via a new
volume "JP 3-XX: Security Cooperation" in the Joint Pub series. Joint
Staff J7 and J5 are leading an effort to revise this doctrine, however
the work is reported to be well intentioned but struggling.

#### It includes all DoD interactions with foreign militaries

**Lopez 21** C. Todd Lopez, writer and editor at the U.S. Department of
Defense, **internally quoting Heidi Grant, Director, and Jedidiah P.
Royal, Deputy Director, of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency**;
"DOD Recognizes 50 Years of Security Cooperation," DOD News, 9-3-2021,
<https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/2764407/dod-recognizes-50-years-of-security-cooperation/>
/GoGreen!

There have been relations between America\'s military and the militaries
of other nations since the United States first became a country.
However, it wasn\'t until 1971 that the Defense Department created the
Defense Security Assistance Agency --- later renamed the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency --- to make security cooperation a formal
function of the Defense Department.

Now a half century later, as DSCA turns 50 years old, it is still
focusing on its original mission to build enduring partnerships between
U.S. and partner nation militaries, making both participants stronger.

There have been many changes over the past five decades, but the value
of Security Cooperation, or SC, to achieve our strategic goals has
endured, [according to **DSCA Director Heidi Grant**]{.underline}, the
first permanent SES civilian to lead the agency. \"Senior leaders across
the U.S. government turn to the SC enterprise for solutions to help
solve the most pressing U.S. defense and foreign policy challenges. In
this era of renewed strategic competition, DSCA must play a leading
role, guiding the SC enterprise into a new age of transformation and
innovation,\" she added.

[**Security cooperation** involves **all** the **DOD interactions,
programs and activities** carried out with foreign security forces and
their institutions. This **includes** **exercises**, **training**,
**armaments coop**eration, **info**rmation **sharing**, collaboration,
**foreign military sales**, ministry **advising** and **humanitarian
assistance**]{.underline}.

\"Security cooperation is one of the most potent tools we have to affect
U.S. national security interests and to influence the trajectory of the
security environment around the world,\" [said **Jedidiah P. Royal**,
the **deputy director**]{.underline} of the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency. It is DSCA that integrates activities across the entire security
cooperation enterprise, Royal said.

\"Security cooperation is our business,\" he said. \"That manifests in a
lot of different ways. But in particular, what we want to make sure is
that for any objective that we have with an ally or partner nation or
group of ally partner nations, that on a pragmatic, practical level, we
are servicing what we have committed to.\"

[That]{.underline}, he said, [**includes** **weapons sales**,
**follow-on training** and **material support**]{.underline}. DSCA
facilitates a lot of weapons and equipment sales to foreign allies and
partner nations. But those sales don't just materially benefit those
nations who buy American equipment --- that\'s only part of the plan.

\"I\'ve been really pleased to see just how much growth there has been
on doctrine level and on strategy development level, on the absorption
of [**logistics** and **sustainment**]{.underline} for these various
pieces of equipment that we might be supporting our allies with,
[building]{.underline} their **[institutional capacity]{.underline}**,\"
Royal said. \"In the past, it may have just been a little bit more
focused on individual pieces of equipment. Now we\'re really looking at
a relationship, a long-term relationship, and [making sure that we
attract allies and partners through not only a piece of equipment, but
for a full spectrum approach]{.underline}.\"

[**Education** for partner nation military personnel is a big part of
what DSCA does]{.underline}, Royal said, and in fiscal year 2020 there
were more than 27,000 students in the Defense Department\'s
international military education and training program --- helping the
service members of foreign militaries develop their own skills, while at
the same time learning how the U.S. military itself does business.

\"We want the individuals in the loop that are making decisions from a
strategy perspective or from a tactical perspective to be familiar with
the way the United States incorporates our values into our national
security enterprise,\" Royal said. \"We want to see them doing the same
things.\"

DSCA [isn\'t just facilitating training and development for officers and
leaders within the militaries of partner and allied nations. It\'s also
working to ensure development of enlisted personnel]{.underline}, said
Air Force Chief Master Sgt. Daniel Simpson, the senior enlisted advisor
to the director at DSCA.

While the United States military has a strong noncommissioned officer
corps, that isn\'t always the case with the militaries of other nations.
A stronger NCO corps is something DSCA would like to help allied and
partner nations develop for themselves as well, Simpson said.

\"The enlisted corps forms the backbone of any military force,\" Simpson
said. \"You can\'t fly the planes, you can\'t operate the tanks, you
can\'t operate any of the systems unless you have trained professionals
to maintain, sustain, and in many cases employ them.\"

In the U.S., he said, those trained professionals are most often
enlisted personnel. DSCA works to develop the enlisted forces or allied
and partner nations through professional military education as well as
through training and exercises, where the U.S. military services work
face-to-face with allied and partner nation militaries on things like
doctrine development, operations, maintenance and sustainment, said
Simpson.

Another thing DSCA does is work to [help partner and allied nations
build their human resources capacity]{.underline} to better support a
professional enlisted corps, Simpson said.

When it was first stood up on Sept. 1, 1971, the then-DSAA [**included**
the **Foreign Military Sales Credit** Program, the **Military
Assistance** Program; the **International Military Education and
Training** Program; and the **Foreign Military Sales**
Program]{.underline}. Back then, the new agency had only 90 employees
dedicated to security cooperation.

Today, DSCA has grown to more than 1,000 employees. And in 2019, DSCA
stood up the Defense Security Cooperation University as well --- a huge
milestone not just for the agency, but for the 20,000 security
cooperation professionals across the security cooperation enterprise.
DSCU and DSCA, have played a critical role in educating and
professionalizing the broader security cooperation workforce and
enterprise.

[DSCA schoolhouses, the **Defense Institute of International Legal
Studies** and the **Institute for Security Governance**]{.underline} now
fall under DSCU. DIILS serves as the lead U.S. defense security
cooperation resource for professional legal engagement with
international defense sector personnel. ISG was established as an
international schoolhouse focused on strengthening civilian control of
the armed forces and democratic governance, with particular emphasis on
emergent democracies worldwide. The realignment of these institutions
under DSCU enhances DSCA\'s Institutional Capacity Building programs.

\"The vision of the university is to bring the entire education element
and professionalization element of \[the\] security arm of the U.S.
government under a single entity,\" Royal said.

The university concept, he said, among other things, provides rigor to
security cooperation education and ensures more efficient and
complementary relationships between once stand-alone security
cooperation school houses.

Standing up DSCU, he said, was a \"significant, inspired vision.\"

Today, to further enhance development and professionalization of the
security cooperation workforce, Royal said DSCA is revising curriculum
at the university and looking to also incorporate concepts from the
Department of State as well.

\"We\'re trying to bring them in more to be able to speak to those
national security objectives \... and look for linkages between the
diplomatic arm of the U.S. government and the security cooperation
arm,\" he said.

Going forward, for the next 50 years, Royal said the agency is working
on a strategic transformation to further enhance how the U.S. military
does security cooperation.

\"[How we\'re moving forward is to focus our **security cooperation**
efforts on a **full spectrum, whole-of-nation approach** with allies and
partners]{.underline}, while simultaneously strengthening a diverse,
certified, adaptable and resilient security cooperation workforce,\" he
said. \"I think that\'s really the driving thought behind us looking
both externally and making sure that we are the tangible manifestation
of the security interests from the White House on down, but also making
sure that we\'re continuing to improve the overall workforce and our
ability to meet those objectives.\"

**Introduction**

The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). At that time, the Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day-to-day management
responsibilities of many security assistance programs authorized by the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export Control Act (AECA).
The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain Department of Defense
(DoD)-funded international programs along with their personnel and
associated resources. In order for U.S. government (USG) agencies, the
private sector, and foreign governments to better understand DSAA's
enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security assistance (SA),
DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs while also leading the wider USG security
cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation programs
continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs), or the military
departments (MILDEPs). Further complicating the management of security
cooperation was the in-country point of contact between the USG and the
host nation. This point of contact was either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA)- sponsored Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or the
DSCA-sponsored Security Cooperation Office (SCO). These two spigots of
security cooperation within a country required a broad knowledge and
skill baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD, its agencies and the
MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of in-country
security cooperation were generally resolved with the establishment of
the Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) having oversight
over both the SCO and DAO organizations.

On 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **formal**]{.underline}, yet still
very broad, [**definition** of **security cooperation** in]{.underline}
Joint Pub 1-02[:]{.underline}

> [All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments to build
> defense relationships]{.underline} that promote specific U.S. security
> interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
> self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to a host nation.

[**DODD 5132.03**, **DoD Policy** and Responsibilities Relating to
Security Cooperation]{.underline}, 29 December [2016, further **defines
security cooperation** with assigned responsibilities:]{.underline}

> [**All DoD interactions with foreign defense establishments** to build
> defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security interests,
> develop allied and partner nation military and security capabilities
> for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
> with peacetime and contingency access to allied and partner nations.
> This **includes** **DoD-administered security assistance**
> programs]{.underline}.

[According to **Title 10 U.S. Code Section 301**, the term "**security
cooperation**]{.underline} programs and activities of the Department of
Defense" [means **any program, activity (including an exercise), or
interaction of the DoD with the security establishment of a foreign
country** to achieve a purpose as follows: (A) To build and develop
allied and friendly security capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations. (B) To provide the armed forces with access to
the foreign country during peacetime or a contingency operation. (C) To
build relationships that promote specific United States security
interests]{.underline}. Other DoD policy statements [identify
DoD-managed or administered security assistance programs as components
of security cooperation]{.underline}.

The purpose of this first chapter is to [**provide definitions** of the
various programs within **security assistance** and the **broader area**
of **security cooperation**]{.underline}.

**Security Assistance**

Over the years, security assistance has included programs authorized by
the FAA or AECA. According to the FAA, as amended, [the term "Security
Assistance" means **military assistance**, **economic support funding**,
**military education** and **training**, **peacekeeping operations**,
**anti-terrorism assistance**, **sales** of defense articles or
services, **export to or for** the armed forces, police, intelligence,
or other international security forces of a foreign
country]{.underline}. [While many of these programs are **administered
by the DoD**]{.underline}, specifically by DSCA, they remain under the
general control of the Department of State (DoS).

**Foreign Military Sales**

The foreign military sales (FMS) program is a non-appropriated program
administered by DSCA through which eligible foreign governments purchase
defense articles, services, and training from the USG. The purchasing
government pays all costs associated with a sale. There is a signed
governmentto-government agreement, normally documented in a Letter of
Offer and Acceptance (LOA), between the USG and a foreign government.
Each LOA is commonly referred to as a "case" and is assigned a unique
case identifier for accounting purposes. Under FMS, military articles
and services, including training, may be provided from DoD stocks
(Section 21, AECA) or from new procurement (Section 22, AECA). If the
source of supply is new procurement, based on an LOA accepted by the
foreign government, the USG agency or MILDEP assigned cognizance for
this case is authorized to enter into a subsequent contractual
arrangement with U.S. industry to provide the article or service
requested.

FMS is a large program with the final FMS total for FY 2020 being \$50.8
billion. This includes \$2.69 billion in Title 10 grant assistance
programs.

**Foreign Military Construction Services**

Foreign Military Construction Services (FMCS) is a non-appropriated
program administered by DSCA and authorized by Section 29, AECA, which
designates the President to sell design and construction services to any
eligible foreign country or international organization. The construction
sales agreement and sales procedures generally parallel those of FMS and
are usually implemented by the MILDEP civil engineering agencies.

**Foreign Military Financing Program**

The Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP) is an appropriated program
administered by DSCA that has undergone a variety of substantive and
terminological changes over the years. At present, the program consists
of congressionally appropriated grants and loans, which enable eligible
foreign governments to purchase U.S. defense articles, services, and
training generally through FMS, or direct commercial sales (DCS) for
select countries. Foreign military sales credit (FMSCR) is authorized
under the provisions of Sections 23 and 24, AECA, and originally served
to provide credit (loans) as an effective means for easing the
transition of foreign governments from grant aid, e.g., Military
Assistance Program (MAP) and International Military Education and
Training (IMET), to cash purchases.

Prior to FY 1989, the USG variously identified this financing program as
the Foreign Military Sales Credit Program or the Foreign Military Sales
Financing Program. In the FY 1989 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act
(FOAA), Congress introduced a new title, the FMFP, and further
identified the forgiven loan/forgiven credit component of the program as
FMFP grants to distinguish them from repayable direct FMFP loans.
Additionally, the terms non-repayable loans or non-repayable credits are
often used by various security assistance organizations (including DSCA)
in place of the term "FMFP grants."

Beginning in FY 1992, the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (P.L.
101-508) changed the method of accounting and budgeting for all
government loans, including FMFP loans issued under the AECA. This
legislation provides a more accurate portrayal of the true cost of loans
by providing new budget authority only for the subsidy element of the
loan program and is the basis for the establishment of two new financial
accounts:

> • The first contains only the FMFP grant portion of the program
> administrative costs.
>
> • The second account provides the budget authority needed to fund the
> subsidy element of the proposed loan programs.

While there are previously authorized FMFP loans still being repaid to
the USG, the FMFP grant element (no repayment) has become the norm.

Over the past several years, per the Presidential Policy Directive 23 of
April 2013 (PPD 23), new FMF pilot programs have been established under
the authority of Section 23 of the AECA---the Foreign Military Financing
Challenge Fund (FMFCF) and Foreign Military Financing Regional Funds
(FMFRF). The FMFCF is intended to provide one-time investments for
special projects for a partner nation that has demonstrated political
will to pursue reform efforts, contribute to common goals, and build
lasting, self-sustaining capabilities. The FMFRF provides flexibility
and responsiveness in implementing portions of the FMF program based
upon geographic region. For example, in FY 2016, \$5 million was
provided for the FMF European Security Assistance Fund (ESAF). Through a
competitive proposal system, these FY 2016 ESAF funds are available for
countries in Europe and Eurasia that have received bilateral FMF within
the five fiscal years prior to submission.

FMFP funding for FY 2020 was \$6.15 billion. FMFP appropriations are
generally grants repayable or non-repayable loans.

**Leases**

Chapter 6, AECA, authorizes the President to lease defense articles to
friendly governments or international organizations for up to five years
(renewable). This non-appropriated program is administered by DSCA. The
law allows the lease of defense articles only for compelling foreign
policy or national security reasons, and stipulates the recipient, with
some exceptions, must bear the full cost of the lease. Furthermore, the
U.S. must not need the leased articles during the lease period, and the
U.S. retains the right to terminate the lease at any time. For the
recipient country, leases may be cheaper than purchasing the article
outright, and they provide a convenient vehicle for obtaining defense
articles for temporary use. Leases are executed through a lease
agreement, with an associated FMS case to cover repair, training, supply
support and/or transportation, if required.

**Military Assistance Program**

In FY 1990, the Military Assistance Program (MAP) was formally merged
with the FMFP as Congress adopted an administration proposal for
integrating all MAP grant funding into the appropriations account for
the FMFP. DSCA administered this appropriated program. However, Congress
has not appropriated MAP funds for subsequent fiscal years, and there is
no interest in seeking any such funds for the future. Therefore, this
legislative charge had the dual effect of causing existing MAP-funded
programs to lose their former identity and become FMFP-funded programs
and establishing the FMFP as the major U.S. financing program for the
acquisition of U.S. defense articles and services by foreign
governments.

MAP remains a current security assistance program because MAP-provided
articles remain throughout the world. As such, these articles retain
their End-Use Monitoring (EUM) requirements: their return to the USG
when no longer needed and the return to the USG any proceeds from
scrapping or sale to a third country.

**International Military Education and Training**

The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program
provides grant financial assistance for training in the U.S. and, in
some cases, in overseas facilities to selected foreign military and
civilian personnel. In earlier years, grant aid training of foreign
military personnel was funded as part of the MAP appropriation. Starting
with FY 1976, a separate authorization for IMET was established in
Section 541, FAA. DSCA administrates this appropriated program. Although
historically a relatively modest program in terms of cost, both the
President and Congress attach significant importance to this program.
The recipient countries, likewise, rely heavily on this grant program
and, in many cases, serve as the only method to receive training from
the U.S. military.

At a time of competition for resources, IMET advances U.S. objectives
globally at a relatively small cost. In many countries, having a core
group of well-trained, professional leaders with firsthand knowledge of
America will make a difference in winning access and influence for our
diplomatic and military representatives. Thus, a relatively small amount
of IMET funding will provide a return for U.S. policy goals, over the
years, far greater than the original investment.

In 1980, Section 644(m)(5), FAA, was amended to authorize IMET tuition
costing in terms of the additional costs that the USG incurs in
furnishing such assistance. Section 21(a)(1)(C), AECA, was also amended
to allow IMET recipients to purchase FMS training on an additional cost
basis. The practical effect of these changes was to reduce tuition costs
substantially for IMET-funded students, thereby increasing the amount of
training an eligible country can obtain by using both national funds for
FMS purchases and alloted IMET grant funds.

**Expanded IMET**

The FY 1991 Foreign Operations Appropriation Act (FOAA) introduced an
IMET initiative via a Senate-proposed earmark of \$1 million to be used
exclusively for expanded IMET courses for foreign officers. Congress
later allowed this initiative to include civilian managers and
administrators of defense establishments. The focus of such training is
on developing professional-level management skills, with emphasis on
military justice systems, codes of conduct, and the protection of human
rights. Congress amended Section 541, FAA to permit non-Ministry of
Defense civilian government personnel to be eligible for this program,
if such military education and training would do the following:

> • Contribute to responsible defense resource management
>
> • Foster greater respect for and understanding of the principle of
> civilian control of the military
>
> • Contribute to cooperation between military and law enforcement
> personnel with respect to counter-narcotics law enforcement efforts
>
> • Improve military justice systems and procedures in accordance with
> internationally recognized human rights

In FY 1993, Congress further extended this expanded IMET (E-IMET)
program to also include participation by national legislators who are
responsible for oversight and management of the military. Through
P.L.104-164, Congress again amended the E-IMET program authority in 1996
to also include non-governmental organization personnel.

In the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated \$111
million for IMET for 2019. In FY 2020, \$112 million was appropriated
and \$113 million in FY 2021 by the Further Consolidation Appropriations
Act of 2021.

**Drawdowns and Special Presidential Waiver Authority**

During a crisis, Section 506, FAA, authorizes the President to provide
USG articles, services, and training to friendly countries and
international organizations at no cost, to include transportation and
spares. There is a \$100 million ceiling per fiscal year on articles,
services, and training provided for military purposes and another fiscal
year ceiling of \$200 million for articles, services, and training
required for non-military purposes such as disaster relief,
nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, counternarcotics, refugee assistance,
and Vietnam War-era prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/MIA)
location and repatriation. When emergency support for peacekeeping
operations is required, Section 552(c)(2), FAA, separately authorizes
the President to drawdown up to \$25 million per fiscal year in USG
articles and services from any agency. Special drawdown authorities have
been annually legislated in the State Department and Foreign Operations
Appropriation Acts (S/FOAA). When the USG avails DoD defense articles,
services, or training via drawdowns, DSCA administers these
nonappropriated authorities.

**Economic Support Fund**

The Economic Support Fund (ESF) is authorized by Chapter 4 of Part II of
the FAA. ESF is an appropriated program administered by the U.S. Agency
for International Development (USAID). Congress established this fund to
promote economic and political stability in areas where the U.S. has
special political and security interests and where the U.S. has
determined that economic assistance can be useful in helping to secure
peace or to avert major economic or political crises. ESF is a flexible
economic instrument available on a grant basis for a variety of
purposes, including balance of payments support, infrastructure, and
other capital and technical assistance development projects in addition
to funding a variety of programs to enhance political stability. In
earlier years, the ESF program included concessional (i.e., low interest
rate) loans as well as grants; recently, all ESF funds receive
allocation as grant assistance. While a substantial amount of these ESF
grants are used to provide balance of payments, the ESF also provides
for programs aimed at primary needs in health, education, agriculture,
and family planning. Where long-term political and economic stability is
the primary concern, ESF finances projects that meet the basic needs of
the poor.

In the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated \$2.5
billion for ESF for 2019. The FY 2020 appropriations were \$3 billion
but decreased in FY 2021 to \$2 billion.

**Peacekeeping Operations**

Peacekeeping Operations (PKO) is an appropriated program authorized by
Chapter 6 of Part II of the FAA. For several years, PKO provided funds
for the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which implemented the
1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty and the U.S. contribution to the
United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP). Subsequent funding has been
provided to support peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans, East Timor,
sub-Saharan Africa, and the Darfur region of the Sudan, South Sudan, and
Somalia.

**Global Peace Operations Initiative**

Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI), which has become the
principal PKO program, was originally a Presidential initiative in
coordination with other G-8 countries to increase the capacity of
selected countries to deploy in support of international peacekeeping
operations. It was envisioned as a five-year program (FYs 2005--2009) to
train seventy-five thousand troops worldwide, with emphasis in the
Africa region and building an African command headquarters capability.
GPOI supports the deployment of peacekeepers by providing equipment,
transportation, training, and sustainment in the field. A DoS program
requiring DoD support, GPOI subsumed the previous SA-funded PKO Africa
Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program and the
FMFP- funded Enhanced International Peacekeeping Capabilities (EIPC)
program. The ACOTA term is still used when referring to the Africa
training component of GPOI.

In the 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated \$163
million for PKO for 2019. The FY 2020 Act appropriated \$457 million. In
FY 2021, this number decreased to \$441 million. All PKO appropriations
are grants managed by the DoS.

**International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement**

The International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) program
is an appropriated grant program which the DoS administers. Authorized
by Section 481, FAA, INCLE is intended to suppress the worldwide illicit
manufacture and trafficking of narcotic and psychotropic drugs, money
laundering, and precursor chemical diversion, and the progressive
elimination of the cultivation of any crops from which such drugs are
derived. Recently, the elimination of related narco-terrorism has been
included. This program can include the purchase of defense articles,
services, and training. This is similar to the authorized and funded
programs within DoD and the Departments of Justice and Homeland
Security.

The 2019 Consolidated Appropriations Act appropriated \$1.49 billion for
INCLE. The FY 2020 appropriations were slightly reduced to \$1.39
billion. The FY 2021 appropriations were further reduced to \$1.38
billion.

**Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs**

The DoS administers a series of appropriated grant programs collectively
known as the Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related
(NADR) programs. Part II, Chapters 8 and 9 of the FAA and Section 504 of
the FREEDOM Support Act authorize NADR. Additionally, Section 23, AECA,
for NADR focuses on demining activities, the clearance of unexploded
ordnance, the destruction of small arms, border security, and related
activities. Related defense articles, services, and training can be
provided through this program. U.S. funding support for the
International Atomic Energy Agency and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty Preparatory Commission is provided through this program. The
DoD role in this program is that DoS can purchase demining, unexploded
ordnance clearance, and anti-terrorism systems with this funding.

In the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated \$655
million for NADR for 2018. The FY 2019 appropriation was for \$864
million. In FY 2020, Congress appropriated \$895 million. In FY 2021,
Congress appropriated \$889 million.

**Direct Commercial Sales**

Direct Commercial Sales (DCS) are commercial exports of defense
articles, services, and training licensed under the authority of Section
38, AECA, made by U.S. defense industry directly to a foreign
government. Unlike the procedures employed for FMS, DoD does not
administer DCS transactions, and a DCS sale does not normally include a
government-to-government agreement. Rather, the DoS Directorate of
Defense Trade Controls (PM/DDTC) implements the required USG controls
through licensing. The International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
\[22 CFR 120-130\] contains the dayto-day rules and procedures for
Direct Commercial Sales.

The DoS grants regulatory approval for over \$136 billion worth of sales
requests per year. Of note, not all license approvals will result in
signed contracts and actual deliveries. Like FMS, DCS deliveries are
likely to take place years after U.S. industry obtains the export
license from PM/DDTC and the interested parties sign the commercial
contract.

**Other Security Assistance Programs**

***Excess Defense Articles***

Excess defense articles (EDA) identified by the MILDEP or DoD agency are
authorized for sale using the FMS authority in Section 21, AECA, and FMS
processes identified within the Security Assistance Management Manual
(SAMM) for property belonging to the USG. Prices range from 5 to 50
percent of original acquisition value, depending on the condition of the
article.

Additionally, Section 516, FAA, authorizes the President to transfer EDA
on a grant basis to eligible countries (annually identified within a
joint DoD/DoS letter to Congress). While EDA can be transferred at no
cost, the recipient must typically pay for any transportation or repair
charges. Under certain circumstances, transportation charges may be
waived, with the cost absorbed by DoD-appropriated funds.

***Third-Country Transfers***

Section 3(d), AECA, authorizes the President to manage and approve the
transfer of U.S.-origin defense articles from the original recipient
country to a third country. Requests for third-country transfers are
normally approved if the USG is willing to conduct a direct transfer to
the third country. Countries must obtain third-country transfer
authority in writing from the DoS in advance of the proposed transfer.
This applies to all U.S.-origin defense articles regardless of the
method of original transfer from the USG or U.S. industry. More can be
found on this subject in the chapter on End-Use Monitoring and
Third-Party Transfers.

**Security Cooperation**

[While all of the programs previously mentioned are authorized
under]{.underline} 22 U.S.C ([Title 22]{.underline}), and are under the
general control of the Department of State (DoS), the Department of
Defense ([DoD]{.underline}) [administers many of them]{.underline}.
Title 10 U.S. Code Section 301 defines security cooperation programs and
activities of DoD as any program or interaction of U.S.C. with the
security establishment of a foreign country to build capabilities,
provide access or build relationships. As such, [many of the previously
described FAA and AECA-authorized security assistance programs
administered by the DoD]{.underline}, in accordance with the SAMM, [fall
under the broad definition of security cooperation]{.underline}. The
following is a categorization of programs, and a brief explanation,
based upon a partial list presented in the 2016 DoD Guidance for
Security Cooperation. For more detail on the different programs that can
be found under each category, access and download the Security
Cooperation Programs book found on the DSCU website or use the SC
Programs Viewer on the Security Assistance Network Web (SANweb).

**Train and Equip/Security Cooperation: DoS Administered Title 22**

This category includes security assistance programs previously
identified and described, and these programs are normally implemented
and managed by DoS, USAID, or both. While under the authority of DoS,
DoD provides material assistance and related training to partner nations
to develop specific capabilities and/or capacities. These programs are
authorized by either the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) (22 U.S.C. 2151,
et. seq.) or the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2751, et.
seq.):

> • Direct Commercial Sales (DCS)
>
> • Drawdowns
>
> • Economic Support Fund (ESF)
>
> • Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI)
>
> • International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE)
>
> • Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related Programs
> (NADR)
>
> • Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)
>
> • Third-Country Transfers

**Train and Equip/Security Assistance: DoD-Administered Title 22**

This category includes security assistance programs previously
identified and described. While under the authority of DoS, DoD provides
materiel assistance and related training to partner nations to develop
specific capabilities and/or capacities. These programs are also
authorized by either the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) (22 U.S.C. 2151,
et. seq.) or the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) (22 U.S.C. 2751, et.
seq.):

> • Excess Defense Articles (EDA)
>
> • Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP)
>
> • Foreign Military Sales (FMS)
>
> • Foreign Military Construction Services (FMCS)
>
> • International Military Education and Training (IMET)
>
> • Leases
>
> • Military Assistance Program (MAP)

**Train and Equip/Security Cooperation: Title 10 Programs**

Under the authority of Title 10, Chapter 16, and/or the current National
Defense Authorization Act, DoD provides material assistance and related
training to partner nations to develop specific capabilities and/or
capacities. This is normally done using DoD Operations and Maintenance
(O&M) funding, but, in some instances, Congress appropriates additional
funding for DoD to conduct these programs. Although it is DoD funding,
these programs, and all security cooperation, must be coordinated with
DoS. Security Cooperation practitioners refer to these programs as
Building Partner Capacity (BPC) programs and execute them using a pseudo
Letter of Offer and Acceptance. All BPC programs require congressional
notification. Below are just a few examples. Examples with four digits
in quotes represent temporary authorities whose authorizations can be
found in various National Defense Authorizations Acts.

> • "1022" Authority to Provide Counterdrug (CD)-Funded Support to Law
> Enforcement Agencies
>
> • "1206" Training of Security Forces and Associated Security
> Ministries of Foreign Countries to Promote Respect for the Rule of Law
> and Human Rights
>
> • "1226" Support to Certain Governments for Border Security Operations
>
> • 333, Foreign Security Forces: Authority to Build Capacity
>
> • Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF)
>
> • European Deterrence Initiative (EDI)
>
> • Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF)
>
> • Counter ISIS Train and Equip Fund (CTEF)
>
> • Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative (MSI)

***Operational Support***

Operational support assistance programs are designed to enable partner
countries to participate in coalition operations by developing specific
capabilities needed for said operations. Alternately, they might focus
on enhanced interoperability among partner countries and sustain partner
operations in cases where partner countries cannot sustain operations on
their own. These are normally done using DoD O&M funding and
congressionally appropriated funds. These programs, and all security
cooperation, must be coordinated with DoS. Below are just a few
examples:

> • "1234" Logistics Support for Coalition Forces Supporting Certain
> U.S. Military Operations
>
> • "1207" Cross Servicing Agreements for Loan of Personnel Protection
> and Personnel Survivability Equipment in Coalition Operations
>
> • "1233" Coalition Support Fund (CSF)
>
> • 331, Friendly Foreign Countries: Authority to Provide Support for
> Conduct of Operations
>
> • Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)
>
> • Coalition Readiness Support Program (CRSP)

***Defense Institution Building (DIB)***

DIB, as per the 27 January 2016 DoD Directive 5205.82, is the
development and capacity building of partner nation defense
institutions, normally at the ministerial or chief of defense level, in
support of U.S. foreign policy and security cooperation goals. According
to this directive, DIB attempts to promote principles vital to the
establishment of defense institutions that are effective, accountable,
transparent, and responsive to national political systems, especially
regarding good governance, oversight of security forces, respect for
human rights, and the rule of law.

Some areas of focus for DIB are defense institutions, organizations and
processes that can ensure effective oversight, management, and execution
of logistics, personnel, budgets, policy, strategy, and doctrine for
effective development, employment, and sustainment of defense
capabilities.

DIB is authorized and funded under Title 10, Section 332, Friendly
Foreign Countries; International and Regional Organizations: Defense
Institution Capacity Building to bring into the Partner Nation (PN) both
full-time resident advisors and long-term, episodic Subject Matter
Expert teams. Funding from other programs can also be used for DIB
related training, education, and professional development.

***International Armaments Cooperation***

International Armaments Cooperation (IAC) can best be described as U.S.
bilateral and multilateral agreements with partner countries focused on
three cooperative areas. First, to share the costs associated with the
cooperative research, development, test, evaluation, and production of
mutually required weapons systems or components, defense technologies,
systems, or equipment; second, to foster joint production and follow-on
support of defense articles or equipment; and, third, to procure foreign
technology, equipment, systems or logistics support. Over time, a
variety of names have been applied to this area of cooperation to
include Armaments Cooperation, International Armaments Cooperation
(IAC), International Armaments Cooperation Programs (IACP), and Defense
Cooperation in Armaments (DCA). Chapter 13 of this book provides more
information on this topic. Below are just a few examples:

> • Information Exchange Program (IEP)
>
> • 311, Exchange of Defense Personnel Between United States and
> Friendly Foreign Countries
>
> • Test and Evaluation Program (TEP)
>
> • Foreign Comparative Testing (FCT) Program
>
> • Cooperative Research, Development, and Acquisition Programs
>
> • Defense Trade
>
> • Cooperative Logistics

***Humanitarian Assistance***

Humanitarian assistance consists of a group of security cooperation
programs designed to improve DoD access, visibility, and influence in a
partner nation (PN) or region and to build the capacity of the PN
government while addressing a humanitarian need. Combatant commands
(CCMDs) may carry out activities funded by Overseas Humanitarian,
Disaster and Civic Aid (OHDACA) across respective Unified Command Plan
(UCP) theaters, offering DoD another tool to promote regional stability
and security. Requests for OHDACA funds for any of these programs are
generally initiated by the in-country SCO. The CCMD then consolidates
and prioritizes before forwarding to DSCA for any required coordination
with DoS/USAID and the military departments. It should be noted that the
DoS has parallel programs generally managed by USAID in response to any
requests by the affected U.S. embassy responding to country
requirements. DoS and USAID annually receive even more funding for
overseas humanitarian, disaster, and migration assistance programs.
Below are just a few examples:

> • Center for Excellence in Disaster Management & Humanitarian
> Assistance (CFE-DM)
>
> • Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP)
>
> • Excess Property as Humanitarian Relief
>
> • Foreign Disaster Relief (FDR)
>
> • Humanitarian Assistance Transportation Program (HATP)
>
> • Humanitarian and Civic Assistance (HCA) during Military Operations
>
> • DoD Humanitarian Assistance (HA)
>
> • Humanitarian Daily Rations (HDR)
>
> • Humanitarian Mine Action (HMA)
>
> • Space-A Transport of NGO Relief

***Education***

There are many security cooperation programs that provide education
opportunities to PN military and civilian personnel. Training can take
place in the U.S., in the PN's country and in some cases in a third
country. Training can include professional military education, tactical
training, and/or technical skills training when they acquire new
equipment from the U.S. Below are just a few examples:

> • "1206" Training of Security Forces and Associated Security
> Ministries of Foreign Countries to Promote Respect for the Rule of Law
> and Human Rights
>
> • 342, Regional Centers for Security Studies (RCSS)
>
> • 345, Regional Defense Combating Terrorism and Irregular Warfare
> Fellowship Program (CTIWFP)
>
> • 346, Distribution to Certain Foreign Personnel of Education and
> Training Material and Information Technology to Enhance Military
> Interoperability with the Armed Forces
>
> • 347, International Engagement Authorities for Service Academies
>
> • 348, Aviation Leadership Program (ALP)
>
> • Attendance at the USCG Academy

***Exercises***

Combined exercises are exercises between the U.S. forces and those of
one or more countries. It is common error to refer to these exercises as
multinational, coalition, or joint operations, but this is doctrinally
incorrect. It should be noted that the term "joint" refers to two or
more services, e.g., Army and Air Force. Exercises can be both joint and
combined, while most combined exercises are singleservice combined
exercises. The primary purpose of combined exercises is the training of
U.S. forces, emphasizing interoperability and capability building,
though the host nation also benefits from the training as well. There
are three types of exercises that may fall under this title:

> • Field Training Exercises (FTX): These are the most realistic of
> exercises, taking the form of actual forces in the field, thus
> allowing all the moving parts to be tested. These are also the most
> resource intensive in money, manpower, material, and preparation time.
>
> • Command Post Exercises (CPX): An exercise in which the forces are
> simulated, involving the commander, the staff, and
> communications/coordination among the participating headquarters.
>
> • Table Top Exercises (TTX): Tabletop exercises are the least
> resource-intensive of these three types, ranging from a formal,
> detailed planning process to a simple discussion. TTXs are excellent
> when senior leaders want to explore a number for possible scenarios or
> possible futures.
>
> Below are just a few examples of security cooperation exercise
> programs and related activities:
>
> • "1251" Training for Eastern European National Security Forces in the
> course of Multilateral Exercises
>
> • 321, Training with Friendly Foreign Countries: Payment of Training
> and Exercise Expenses
>
> • 322, Special Operations Forces: Training with Friendly Foreign
> Forces
>
> • Defense Health Program
>
> • Exercise-Related Construction (ERC)
>
> • Joint Exercise Program

***Contacts***

There can be some confusion about the definition of contact events
and/or Military-to-Military (M2M) events. In the past, Section 168 of
Title 10 provided authorization for contact events and/ or Mil-to-Mil
events. However, part of NDAA 2017, Section 168, was repealed, and these
types of events are now authorized under Chapter 16 of Title 10,
specifically Subchapter II Military-to-Military Engagements. One of the
most important things to remember is that events conducted under this
authority should not cross into the training realm. They should be
designed to enable defense and military leaders to engage with partner
countries for discussions, exchanges of tactics, planning, and other
purposes that encourage democratic orientation of defense establishments
and military forces of other countries; but not training. Contacts are
largely conducted between U.S. military and civilian defense personnel
and the military and civilian defense personnel of a partner country but
may also include non-defense personnel of partner countries who play key
security roles. Events, normally, but not always, fall into one of these
categories:

> • Traveling contact teams
>
> • Familiarization visits
>
> • Military liaison teams
>
> • Seminars and conferences held primarily in a theater of operations
>
> • Distribution of publications primarily in a theater of operations
>
> • Personnel expenses of DoD personnel as they relate to above
> activities
>
> Below are just a few examples of the authorities under which DoD
> conducts contact events:
>
> • 311, Exchange of Defense Personnel between United States and
> Friendly Foreign Countries: Authority
>
> • 312, Payment of Personnel Expenses Necessary for Theater Security
> Cooperation
>
> • 342, Regional Centers for Security Studies (RCSS)
>
> • 344, Participation in Multinational Military Centers of Excellence

An organization that might be involved in supporting contact events is
the National Guard, which is part of the Department of Defense State
Partnership Program (SPP), which is authorized under 10 USC 341 (Title
10, Chapter 16, subchapter V). More on this later in this chapter.

***Exchanges***

There are a variety of options for conducting exchanges of military and
civilian defense personnel with partner countries that may be used to
develop familiarity with partner country systems, processes,
interoperability, and technical expertise. There can be exchanges of
civilian or military personnel between DoD and ministries of defense.
There can be exchanges of military personnel between units of U.S. armed
forces and foreign armed forces. There can also be exchange of personnel
on a nonreciprocal basis. Below are just a few examples of the
authorities under which DoD conducts exchanges:

> • 311, Exchange of Defense Personnel Between United States and
> Friendly Foreign Countries: Authority
>
> • Reciprocal, No-charge Flight Training School
>
> • Reciprocal, No-charge Professional Military Education (PME) Student
> Exchanges
>
> • Reciprocal, No-charge Unit Exchanges

**Security Force Assistance**

Lessons learned from the combat activities and subsequent foreign
government reconstitution efforts in Southwest Asia drove the Department
of the Army (HQDA) and U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) to
develop a new concept of operations titled Security Force Assistance
(SFA). HQDA FM 3-07.1, "Security Force Assistance," May 2009 (superseded
by FM 3-22, Army Support to Security Cooperation, 22 January 2013), is
the first document to define SFA as the unified action to generate,
employ, and sustain local, host-nation or regional security forces in
support of a legitimate authority. The following year, Department of
Defense Instruction (DODI) 5000.68 of 27 October 2010 titled "Security
Force Assistance" established DoD policy for SFA and assigned
responsibilities. The directive restated the definition of SFA to be DoD
activities that contribute to the unified action by the USG to support
the development of the capacity and capability of foreign security
forces (FSF) and their supporting institutions.

Moving from tactical to strategic levels, SFA is engagement at the
tactical and operational level, Defense Institution Building (DIB), as
part of Institutional Capacity Building (ICB), is engagement at the
operational (ministerial) level and Security Sector Assistance (SSA) is
engagement at the strategic, whole-of-government level.

According to the April 2013 Presidential Policy Directive 23 (PPD 23),
strategic-level SSA aims to strengthen the ability of the U.S. to help
allies and partner nations build their own security consistent with the
principles of good governance and the rule of law across their
government. The DoS has the lead on SSA and convenes the Interagency SSA
Oversight Board, which they co-chair with DoD. SSA objectives with a PN
should reflect the objectives of the respective U.S. embassy's
Integrated Country Strategy (ICS). In this respect, SSA is a coordinated
USG effort focused on helping countries fight alongside U.S. forces
countering terrorist and international criminal networks, participate in
international peacekeeping operations, and maintain law and order in
their respective countries.

SFA encompasses all of the activities required to develop a FSF,
identifying and generating needed functions from the leadership level of
the PN ministry of defense down to the entry-level private. The FSF and
the broader terms of the security sector encompass the military,
paramilitary, police, intelligence forces, border police, coast guard,
customs officials, prison guards, and correctional personnel that
provide security for a partner nation and its relevant population or
support a regional security organization's mission. U.S. DoD civilians,
contractors, conventional, and Special Operations Forces can be the
providers of SFA. As a subset of DoD security cooperation, SFA draws
from multiple security cooperation programs to include security
assistance (Title 22) for resources.

That said, there are parameters for what SFA is and, more clearly, what
does not qualify as SFA. 3-07.1 states that (1) the mere provision of
defense articles without related training is not SFA, (2) military
exchange programs are not SFA, (3) humanitarian assistance and civic
action are not SFA, and (4) joint exercises are not SFA. Combined
operations must include U.S. forces as advisors, mentors, partners, or
augmenters within FSF units to be SFA, and not U.S. units conducting
independent operations alongside FSF.

In summary, as part of security cooperation activities, SFA, DIB, and
SSA all work together at their respective levels with our partner
nations toward strengthening their FSF capabilities while also
supporting U.S. national security goals and achieving DoD security
cooperation end states.

**Department of Defense State Partnership Program (SPP)**

As previously mentioned, Section 341, Department of Defense State
Partnership Program (SPP) allows the National Guard of U.S. states and
territories to interact and exchange personnel with civil, military, and
emergency/disaster response personnel of friendly partner nations. Many
of these same partner nations will have an assigned Bilateral Affairs
Officer (BAO) from the National Guard state partner leading and managing
the SPP effort and coordinating other mil-to-mil events. The National
Guard partner may also conduct humanitarian assistance and training
events when authorized.

The National Guard's involvement reflects an evolving international
affairs strategy using the unique civil-military nature of the National
Guard to interact with both civil and defense personnel of foreign
countries. The state partners actively participate in a host of
engagement activities, e.g., bilateral familiarization and training
events, emergency management, environmental remediation exercises,
fellowship-style internships, educational exchanges, and civic leader
visits. All activities are coordinated through the CCMD and the U.S.
Ambassador's country team, and other agencies, as appropriate, to ensure
that National Guard support is tailored to meet both U.S. and country
objectives. Table 1-1 illustrates the partnerships.

All state National Guards have an SPP coordinator who manages the
program from the state National Guard headquarters. This program also
includes the exchange of authorized National Guard personnel with
military forces, security forces, or other government organizations of a
country whose primary functions include disaster or emergency response.

Typically, funding of SPP activities is not availed unless the activity
is jointly approved by the applicable combatant command and chief of
mission/ambassador. The National Guard members must be on active duty to
use these funds. National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs) issue
annual changes, and it is imperative to check with respective CCMDs for
the latest guidance.

**\[Table 1-1 OMITTED\]**

**Summary**

Security assistance has been part of our nation's history ever since the
Revolutionary War. Since World War II, the USG has progressively
institutionalized and leveraged security assistance as a tool to advance
U.S. interests in a global environment.

[The term **security assistance**]{.underline} itself [is **subject to
differing interpretations**]{.underline}. [The relatively
recent]{.underline} development and [use of the term **security
cooperation**, which incorporates DoD-managed security assistance
programs, **has become the standard** to describe **all DoD
international activities**]{.underline}.

If the past is any predictor of the future, security cooperation will be
in existence for many years to come. In this regard, the words of former
Deputy SecDef, William P. Clements, Jr., are as appropriate today as
when they were spoken years ago:

> Many contend that such a program \[as security assistance\] has
> outlived its usefulness and is an anachronism in these days of a trend
> towards détente. To do so is not only to misread the history of the
> past twenty-five years but to misinterpret the signs of the times. The
> record is open to all who care to consult it. That record fully
> substantiates the conclusion that the world situation in which we
> currently find new hope for the future would not exist if the people
> of the United States had earlier refused to concern themselves with
> the common defense of the Free World. Had we not become involved and,
> for more than two decades, supported and encouraged the efforts of
> allied and friendly countries to protect themselves against threats to
> their territorial integrity and internal security, the complexion of
> the globe might be dangerously different today, and the international
> climate far more hostile. \[Commander's Digest, July 12, 1973\]

The above 1973 historical quote highlights the evolution of SC and
underscores the extraordinary changes to SC issued by the FY 2017 NDAA.
The increasing scope of SC activities to include all DoD international
programs and those FAA/AECA-authorized programs administered by DSCA is
testament to increased DoD policy responsibilities and the imperative to
develop the SC workforce. Execution of foreign policy in terms of SC
reaches from the Secretary of Defense through DSCA to the CCMD, and
finally to the in-country SDO/DATT, DAO, and SCO. Increasingly, almost
every community within DoD and its respective leadership is recognizing
the role they play in SC and the pivotal role SC plays in achieving U.S.
foreign policy and national security objectives.

**Interagency Terminology**

Discussion of military and related assistance to foreign countries is
sometimes hindered by a lack of a standard
terminology.**[9]{.underline}** The following terms are frequently used
to describe assistance to foreign governments, security services, and
militaries:

- **[Security Assistance (Title 22)]{.underline}**. Although not defined
  in Title 22 of U.S. Code, [the term **security assistance** is
  commonly used to refer to the six budget accounts for which the
  **State Department** requests international security assistance
  appropriations and whose underlying authorities reside in the Foreign
  Assistance Act]{.underline} of 1961 (**[FAA]{.underline}**, P.L.
  87-195) [and Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} in 1976
  (**[AECA]{.underline}**, P.L. 90-629), as amended.**[10]{.underline}**

**\[FOOTNOTES 9-10\]**

**[9]{.underline}** [Some of the terms used by U.S. government officials
and defense observers include military assistance, security assistance,
security cooperation, security force assistance, train and equip, and
building partner capacity]{.underline}. Definitions of the respective
terms may be found in legislation, policy and guidance documents, and
statements made by U.S. government officials. [The **lack of standard
terminology has implications** for oversight over U.S. security
assistance programs]{.underline}. [A recent]{.underline} U.S. Government
Accountability Office ([GAO]{.underline}) [report noted that, according
to DOD officials, it is "not feasible" for "DOD to provide the
individual program amount and total amount of funding for all DOD
security cooperation programs intended to build partner security
capabilities due to]{.underline} "(1) [the **lack of agreed-upon
definition** and listing of these programs]{.underline} and (2) the
difficulty in identifying funding for programs that do not have a direct
line of funding." GAO, Building Partner Capacity: Inventory of
Department of Defense Security Cooperation and Department of State
Security Assistance Efforts, GAO-17-255R, March 24, 2017.

**[10]{.underline}** [**Security assistance** is also **used as a
generic term** used throughout the U.S. government to describe
assistance provided to foreign military and security forces, regardless
of the agency providing that assistance]{.underline}. The annual State
Department congressional budget justification (CBJ) identifies six
budget accounts under the heading "International Security Assistance,"
which are commonly referred to as the State Department's security
assistance portfolio.

[DOD also uses the term security assistance to refer specifically to a
group of State Department programs authorized by the]{.underline}
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961([FAA]{.underline}) [and]{.underline} Arms
Export Control Act ([AECA]{.underline}), [funded by State Department
appropriations and managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA)]{.underline}, an agency under the Office of the Secretary of
Defense for Policy (OSD)(P).

**\[/FOOTNOTES 9-10\]**

- **[Security Cooperation (Title 10)]{.underline}**. DOD uses [the term
  **security cooperation**]{.underline} to [refer to activities
  authorized by provisions in **Title 10** and National Defense
  Authorization Acts (NDAAs)]{.underline}. The FY2017 NDAA [defines
  security cooperation as "any program, activity (including an
  exercise), or **interaction** of the **Department of Defense** with
  the security establishment of a foreign country to achieve a purpose
  as follows:]{.underline}

- [To build and develop allied and friendly security capabilities for
  self-defense and multinational operations]{.underline}.

- [To provide the armed forces with access to the foreign country during
  peacetime or a contingency operation]{.underline}.

- [To build relationships that promote specific U]{.underline}nited
  [S]{.underline}tates [security
  interests]{.underline}."**[11]{.underline}**

- **Security Sector Assistance**. In April 2013, the Obama
  Administration issued Presidential Decision Directive 23 (PPD-23). The
  directive called for an overhaul of U.S. security sector assistance
  policy and for the creation of a new interagency framework for
  planning, implementing, assessing, and overseeing security sector
  assistance. The term security sector assistance refers to all State
  Department security assistance programs and virtually all DOD security
  cooperation programs, exercises, and engagements, as well as related
  activities of the USAID, DOJ, and other agencies.12

**collectively** referred to as "**Title 10
authorities**.")]{.underline}

[When **only Title 10 authorities are involved**, the term **"security
cooperation"** is used. Where possible, this report uses specific terms,
for instance, "military assistance" for programs that involve only
foreign military forces, or "humanitarian assistance" for DOD programs
that provide disaster relief and other forms of humanitarian aid to
foreign populations]{.underline}.

Legal and Institutional Framework

The current legal and institutional framework for assistance to foreign
militaries and other security forces has its origins in congressional
documents, legislation, and executive orders that, beginning in the late
1940s, established the respective roles and responsibilities of the
Department of State and DOD. A lead oversight role for the Secretary of
State has been a central and enduring feature for most of the time since
then, as has been DOD's major role in administering many security
assistance programs. Nevertheless, the legal and institutional basis for
State Department influence and oversight has evolved over time.

The Development of the Shared Partnership Legal Framework9

The principle of civilian leadership, influence, and oversight of
security assistance was a central feature of the first large-scale U.S.
foreign assistance (including military assistance) programs during the
post-World War II and early Cold War years. These early military and
security force assistance programs were first instituted to help foreign
governments build the capacity to defend against state-based foreign
threats, principally the Soviet Union. This assistance started with the
Greek-Turkish Aid Act, 1947, and the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of
1949, and continued through the Mutual Security Acts of the 1950s. For
most of that period, program direction and oversight of funds authorized
under these acts were vested in the Secretary of State by executive
orders, although for four years White House officials were in charge,
and for some of this early period, U.S. ambassadors played a major role.

The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (1961 FAA), Section 622(c), fixed the
Secretary of State's leadership role in statute for funds authorized by
the act, charging the Secretary with responsibility, under the direction
of the President, for the "continuous supervision and general direction"
of foreign assistance, including military assistance, education, and
training under the act. In 1968, Congress broadened the scope of this
responsibility to include all military assistance, regardless of the
source of authority. Under Section 623, Congress charged the Secretary
of Defense with responsibility for administering the FAA-authorized
military assistance programs (a function originally assigned to the
Secretary of Defense under Mutual Security Acts of the 1950s). Through
executive orders, the President delegated to the Secretary of State most
of the foreign assistance authority assigned to him by the 1961 FAA, but
retained the legislative mandate for State Department oversight and DOD
administration regarding military assistance.

Beginning in the 1980s, Congress began providing DOD with authority in
Title 10 of the U.S. Code and annual National Defense Authorization Acts
(NDAAs) (often referred to collectively as "Title 10 authorities") to
conduct a wide range of programs and activities funded by DOD
appropriations. Congress began providing such authorities in the 1980s
for counternarcotics and humanitarian assistance; authority for
nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs was subsequently added in
the 1980s and 1990s.

With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, U.S. government
assistance to and engagement with foreign militaries and security forces
has been employed to counter new threats, including those from non-state
actors. Many of the new authorities were provided to DOD, especially
after the terrorist attacks on the United States of September 11, 2001
(9/11).

As the United States undertook military action in Afghanistan in 2001
and then in Iraq in 2005, Congress provided a number of DOD crisis and
wartime authorities, some providing new global authority and some
specific to those conflicts. Most recently, DOD statutes have been added
regarding U.S. assistance to conflicts in Africa. [The Defense Institute
for Security Assistance Management (**DISAM**) **catalogues**
approximately **80 Title 10 security cooperation programs** and
authorities]{.underline};**[10]{.underline}** [**RAND**, using different
criteria, identifies **106 "core" Title 10 security cooperation**
statutes]{.underline}.**[11]{.underline}** [Although **not subject to**
1961 **FAA and AECA conditions**, **Title 10 security cooperation**
authorities may be **subject to NDAA and DOD appropriations conditions,
including conditions on human rights** observance]{.underline}.12

Hereinafter referred to as RAND: From Patchwork to Framework.

**\[/FOOTNOTE 10-11\]**

After U.S. military action began in Afghanistan and Iraq, Congress
provided several authorities for DOD to support partners in those
efforts. One was a broad authority for coalition assistance not limited
to those two conflicts. Others enabled assistance to (1) those countries
providing military forces to participate in those conflicts and (2)
bordering countries that providing assistance and other support for
those operations. Congress also provided new authorities to support
bilateral security assistance in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The growth of the Title 10 authorities has raised questions about the
historical division of responsibility between the Secretary of State and
the Secretary of Defense. [About **50 of the 80 security cooperation
statutes identified by DISAM specifically require the concurrence of the
Secretary of State** before the Secretary of Defense may
exercise]{.underline} his [authority]{.underline}. Some analysts state
that this proliferation of Title 10 authorities has muddled the
coherence of U.S. programs and policy and undermined the earlier clarity
of 1961 FAA Section 622(c) Secretary of State oversight
responsibility.13 Other analysts question the extent to which the
provision extends State Department oversight to noncombat aid and
activities authorized by Title 10 and NDAAs.14

Appendix B. Major DOD Security Cooperation Authorities/Programs23

This appendix describes [DOD **security cooperation**
programs:]{.underline}

- Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF). ASFF permits the Secretary of
  Defense to provide assistance to the security forces of Afghanistan,
  which may include provision of equipment, supplies, services,
  training, facility and infrastructure repair, renovation, and
  construction and funding. It also authorizes the Secretary of Defense
  to accept contributions to the ASFF from non-U.S. government sources,
  and to transfer ASFF funds to other accounts. ASFF is authorized by
  Section 1513 (FY2008 NDAA, P.L. 110-181), as amended.

- Afghanistan Infrastructure Fund (AIF). AIF allows the Secretary of
  Defense and Secretary of State jointly to develop and carry out
  infrastructure projects in Afghanistan. The authority expired on
  September 30, 2015, but FY2017 appropriations legislation (P.L.
  115-31) makes funds appropriated to the Afghanistan Security Forces
  Fund (ASFF) available for additional costs associated with existing
  projects funded under AIF. AIF was authorized by Section 1217 (FY2011
  NDAA, P.L. 111-383).

- **[Building Capacity of Foreign Security Forces]{.underline}**.
  [Commonly described as DOD's "Global **Train and Equip**"
  authority]{.underline}, the Secretary of Defense may build the
  capacity of a foreign country's national military forces to enable
  such forces to conduct counterterrorism operations or to support or
  participate in military, stability, and peace support operations that
  benefit U.S. national security interests. The Secretary may also
  authorize activities to enable a foreign country's maritime or border
  security forces, and other national-level security forces with
  counterterrorism responsibilities, to conduct counterterrorism
  operations.

- DOD's global train and equip activities were originally authorized by
  Section 1206 (FY2006 NDAA, P.L. 109-163), as amended. Section 1206 was
  the first major DOD authority to be used expressly for the purpose of
  training and equipping the national military forces of foreign
  countries worldwide. The authority was later codified as 10 U.S.C.
  2282 in the FY2015 NDAA (P.L. 113- 291). Activities permitted under 10
  U.S.C. 2282 have been incorporated into a new, broader global train
  and equip authority established by Section 1241(c) of the FY2017 NDAA:
  10 U.S.C. 333.24

- Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP). CERP authorizes U.S.
  military commanders in Afghanistan to carry out small-scale projects
  to address urgent humanitarian relief or urgent reconstruction needs
  within their areas of responsibility. CERP is authorized by Section
  1201 (FY2012 NDAA P.L. 112- 81), as amended.

- Combatant Commanders Initiative Fund (CCIF). CCIF provides
  discretionary funding for combatant commanders to conduct various
  activities, especially in response to unforeseen contingencies. A few
  permitted uses are related to foreign assistance. These include
  humanitarian and civic assistance, urgent and unanticipated
  humanitarian relief and reconstruction. Permitted activities also
  include force training, contingencies, selected operations, command
  and control, joint exercises, military education and training for
  military and related civilian personnel of foreign countries,
  including transportation, translation, and administrative expenses (up
  to \$5 million per year). Up to \$10 million per year may be spent to
  sponsor the participation of foreign countries in joint exercises. 10
  U.S.C. 166a authorizes the fund, but activities are carried out under
  other authorities.

- [**Cooperative Threat Reduction** (CTR)]{.underline}. The purpose of
  CTR is to (1) facilitate the elimination and safe and secure transport
  and storage of chemical, biological, or other weapons (and weapons
  components, related materials, and delivery vehicles), and (2)
  facilitate the safe and secure transport and storage of nuclear
  weapons, nuclear weapons-usable or high-threat radiological materials,
  nuclear weapons components, and delivery vehicles, as well as the
  elimination of nuclear weapons, components, and delivery vehicles. CTR
  also authorizes the Secretary to prevent the proliferation of nuclear,
  chemical, and biological weapons, components, and related materials,
  technology, and expertise, as well as of weapons of mass
  destruction-related materials. The FY2017 NDAA authorized \$325.6
  million to be available for obligation in FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019.
  CTR is authorized by Sections 1301-1352 (FY2015 NDAA, P.L. 113-291),
  as amended.

- [**Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund** (CTPF)]{.underline}. CTPF
  provides support and assistance to foreign security forces or other
  groups or individuals to conduct, support, or facilitate
  counterterrorism and crisis response activities pursuant to Section
  1534 of the FY2015 NDAA. Section 1534 of FY2015 NDAA stipulates that
  funds may be transferred to other accounts for use under existing DOD
  authority established by "any other provision of law." [**DOD may
  conduct CTPF activities only in** areas of responsibility of the U.S.
  **CENTCOM and AFRICOM**]{.underline}, unless the Secretary of Defense
  determines that authority needs to be applied elsewhere to address
  threats to U.S. national security.25 Section 1510 (FY2016 NDAA, P.L.
  113-235), as amended, authorizes the appropriation of funds for CTPF.

- [Coalition Support Fund]{.underline} (CSF). CSF Authorizes the
  Secretary of Defense to [reimburse key cooperating countries for
  logistical, military, and other support, including access, to or in
  connection with U.S. military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, or
  Syria]{.underline} and to assist such nations with U.S. funded
  equipment, supplies and training. Aggregate amount of reimbursements
  may not exceed \$1.1 billion between October 1, 2016, and December
  31, 2017. Additional reimbursement restrictions apply to Pakistan for
  certain counterterrorism activities and activities along the
  Afghanistan-Pakistan border region. CSF is authorized by Section 1233
  (FY2008 NDAA, P.L. 110-181), as amended.

- Defense Institutional Reform Initiative (DIRI). The Defense
  Institution Reform Initiative (DIRI) is conducted through the Office
  of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) Rule of Law program under 10 U.S.C.
  168, military-to-military contacts authority, and 10 U.S.C. 1051,
  developing country participation in multilateral, bilateral, or
  regional events. DIRI supports foreign defense institutions and
  related agencies by determining institutional needs and developing
  projects to meet them. DIRI both scopes out projects for execution
  under the MODA and conducts its own military-to-military informational
  engagements.26

- [**European Reassurance Initiative** (ERI)]{.underline}. ERI permits
  the Secretary of Defense to [provide assistance to reassure NATO
  allies and improve the security and capacity of U.S. partners. ERI
  permits an increased U.S. military presence in Europe, additional
  exercises and training with allies and partners, improvements to
  infrastructure to enhance responsiveness, prepositioning U.S.
  equipment in Europe, and increasing efforts to build partner capacity
  for new NATO members and other partners]{.underline}. ERI is
  authorized by Section 1535 (FY2015 NDAA, P.L. 113- 291).

- Iraq Train and Equip Fund (ITEF). ITEF authorizes the Secretary of
  Defense to provide up to \$630 million in assistance to Iraq and
  partner nations to defend against the Islamic State and its allies,
  which may include training, equipment, logistics support, supplies,
  services, stipends, facility and infrastructure repair, renovation,
  and sustainment. ITEF is authorized by Section 1236 (FY2015 NDAA, P.L.
  113-291), as amended.

- [Logistic Support for Allied Forces in Combined
  Operations]{.underline}: 10 U.S.C. 127d ([Global Lift and
  Sustain]{.underline}) authorizes the Secretary of Defense to [provide
  logistics, supplies, and services to allied forces participating in a
  combined operation with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
  as well as to a nonmilitary logistics, security, or similar agency of
  an allied government if it would benefit U.S. armed forces.27

- [Ministry of Defense Advisors Program]{.underline} (MODA). The MODA
  program allows the Secretary of Defense to assign civilian Department
  of Defense employees as advisors to foreign ministries of defense or
  security agencies serving a similar defense function to provide advice
  and other training and to assist in building core institutional
  capacity, competencies, and capabilities. MODA is authorized by
  Section 1081 (FY2012 NDAA, P.L. 112-81), as amended.28

- Regional Centers for Security Studies (RCSS). DOD Regional Centers for
  Security Studies function to provide bilateral and multilateral
  research, communications, and exchange of ideas involving military and
  civilian participants. 10 U.S.C. 184 authorizes the administration of
  Regional Centers. 29

- [Regional Defense Combating Terrorism Fellowship]{.underline} Program
  (CTFP). The program allows the Secretary of Defense to use funds
  appropriated to DOD to pay any costs associated with the education and
  training of foreign military officers, ministry of defense officials,
  or security officials at military or civilian educational
  institutions, regional centers, conferences, seminars, or other
  training programs conducted under the Regional Defense Combating
  Terrorism Fellowship Program. The total amount of funds spent under
  this authority may not exceed \$35 million per fiscal year. The
  program is authorized by 10 U.S.C. 2249c.

- Southeast Asia Maritime Security Initiative (MSI). MSI permits the
  Secretary of Defense to increase maritime security and maritime domain
  awareness of specific foreign countries along the South China Sea by
  providing assistance and training to national military or other
  security forces whose functional responsibilities include maritime
  security missions.

- [**Ukraine Security Assistance** Initiative (USAI)]{.underline}. The
  USAI permits the Secretary of Defense to provide up to \$300 million
  in FY2016 and \$350 million in FY2017 [for security assistance and
  intelligence support, including training, equipment, logistics
  support, and supplies and services to military and other security
  forces of Ukraine]{.underline}. USAI is authorized by Section 1250
  (FY2016 NDAA, P.L. 114-92), as amended.

- **[Wales (formerly Warsaw) Initiative]{.underline}** Fund (WIF). The
  WIF was formerly named the Warsaw Initiative Fund, but was renamed
  after the Wales NATO summit in September 2014. It [supports the
  participation of 16 developing countries in the State Department-led
  **Partnership for Peace** Program]{.underline}. This fund has enabled
  a wide range of assistance, including equipment and training, but is
  currently used primarily for defense institution building, according
  to DSCA officials. Activities funded by WIF are conducted using the
  authority of three statutes (10 U.S.C. 168, 10 U.S.C. 1051, and 10
  U.S.C. 2010).30

Appendix A. [**DOS/USAID Security Assistance** Programs]{.underline}20

This appendix describes the security assistance programs funded through
the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
(SFOPS) appropriations:

- [International Narcotics and Law Enforcement]{.underline} (INCLE). The
  INCLE account funds international counter-narcotics activities,
  anti-crime programs, and antihuman trafficking programs. In addition,
  activities conducted under INCLE include rule of law programs, such as
  law enforcement support and justice sector capacity building. For
  example, funds support efforts to enhance bilateral and regional
  cooperation to combat drug trafficking and organized crime in Mexico,
  drug interdiction and alternative development in Colombia and the
  Andean region, and judicial system reform and counter-narcotics
  activities in Afghanistan. [Although programs authorized under INCLE
  generally provide nonmilitary support, DOD may play a role if defense
  articles or services are provided through the Defense Security
  Cooperation Agency (DSCA)]{.underline}. State Department authority for
  counter-narcotics programs is contained in Chapter 8 of Part I of the
  FAA (22 U.S.C. 2291 et seq.).

- [Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related
  Programs]{.underline} (NADR). The NADR account funds a variety of
  State Department-managed activities aimed at countering proliferation
  of weapons of mass destruction, supporting anti-terrorism training and
  related activities, and promoting demining operations in developing
  countries. Programs conducted include border security activities and
  may involve law enforcement and military personnel. If necessary,
  [DOD, through DSCA, may provide defense articles and services for some
  NADR programs. DOD may also provide other support, including
  conducting DOD-funded programs in conjunction with NADR-funded
  programs]{.underline}.21 NADR is authorized by several provisions of
  law (Part I, §301, and Part II, Chapters 8-9, of the FAA; §23 of AECA;
  §504, FREEDOM Support Act (FSA) of 1992 \[P.L. 102- 511\]).

- [Peacekeeping Operations]{.underline} (PKO).The PKO account funds
  programs to provide articles, services, and training for countries
  participating in international peacekeeping operations, including
  United Nations (U.N.) and regional operations. Most support under PKO
  is provided to foreign militaries. PKO programs include efforts to
  diminish and resolve conflicts, address terrorism threats, and reform
  military establishments. In addition, PKO funds U.S. military
  participation in the Multilateral Force and Observers (MFO) in the
  Sinai.

- DOD sometimes uses its own funds to complement or assist PKO-funded
  programs. In addition, DOD provides support to the Global Peace
  Operations Initiative (GPOI) to train, equip, and support the
  deployment of foreign military troops and police for U.N. and regional
  peacekeeping missions. DOD, through DSCA, may also contribute defense
  articles and services to other PKO-funded missions such as maritime
  security and counter-poaching activities. PKO programs are authorized
  by FAA Sections 551-553 (22 U.S.C. 2348).

- Andean Counterdrug Initiative (ACI). The ACI account provided
  assistance from FY2002-FY2008 (although some obligations continue to
  flow) to Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and
  Venezuela to address drug trafficking and economic development issues.
  ACI was authorized by 22 U.S.C. 2291a-j (Chapter 8, Part I, §§481-490,
  FAA, as amended).

- [International Military Education and Training (IMET)]{.underline}.
  IMET provides grant financial assistance to selected foreign military
  and civilian personnel for training and education on U.S. military
  practices and standards, including democratic values. For example,
  IMET sends foreign personnel to the military service senior-level war
  colleges and the National Defense University, as well as to military
  service Command and Staff Colleges, where they take basic and advanced
  officer training. In 1990, the program was expanded (E-IMET) to
  provide opportunities for foreign civilian defense and related
  personnel to attend educational programs promoting responsible defense
  resource management, in addition to other purposes. [The State
  Department controls the funds and has policy authority; DOD, through
  DSCA, administers this program]{.underline}. IMET is authorized by FAA
  Sections 541-543 (22 U.S.C. 2347).

- [Foreign Military Financing (FMF)]{.underline}. The FMF program
  provides financing of the purchase of defense articles, services, and
  training (usually on a grant basis) through the Foreign Military Sales
  (FMS) system---the U.S. government's conduit for selling, weapons,
  equipment, and associated training to friendly foreign countries---or
  through Direct Commercial Sales (DCS). The State Department is
  primarily responsible for determining which nations are to receive
  military assistance. [DOD, through the Defense Security Cooperation
  Agency (DSCA), implements this program.]{.underline} FMF is authorized
  by Section 23 of the AECA (22 U.S.C. 2763).

- Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund (PCCF). Section 1224 (NDAA
  FY2010, P.L. 111-84), as amended, authorized the Pakistan
  Counterinsurgency Fund (PCF) and permitted the Secretary of Defense,
  with Secretary of State concurrence, to provide assistance for
  Pakistan's security forces to bolster their counterinsurgency efforts.
  Title III of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 (P.L. 111-32)
  appropriated \$400 million for PCF. After authorization expired, the
  Secretary of State assumed responsibility in subsequent fiscal years
  under the name Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund with funding
  from State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs appropriations.
  PCCF was authorized by 22 U.S.C. 2291, 22 U.S.C. 2311, 22 U.S.C. 2347,
  22 U.S.C. 2348, 22 U.S.C. 2349aa, and 22 U.S.C. 2763.

- [Global Security Contingency Fund]{.underline} (GSCF). [GSCF is a
  joint DOD-DOS fund]{.underline} to provide assistance to enhance the
  capabilities of a country's military or other national security forces
  to conduct border and maritime security, internal defense, and
  counterterrorism operations, or participate in military, stability, or
  peace support operations. It is also authorized to support the justice
  sector in countries where conflict or instability challenges the
  capacity of civilian providers. The GSCF authority provides authority
  for DOD to transfer up to \$200 million per fiscal year to the fund,
  but caps DOD contributions to each project at 80% of the cost. GSCF is
  authorized by Section 1207 (NDAA FY2012, P.L. 112-81), as amended.
  GSCF authority expired on September 30, 2017. 22

Capacity: Inventory of Department of Defense Security Cooperation and
Department of State Security Assistance Efforts," GAO-17-255R,
3-24-2017, <https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-255r.pdf> /GoGreen!

House Armed Services Committee Report 114-102, accompanying
[the]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Act
([NDAA]{.underline}) for Fiscal Year 2016 (H.R.1735), [includes a
provision for us to report on an inventory of DOD security cooperation
programs]{.underline} intended to build partner security capabilities.3
[DOD defines these programs as including DOD-administered State security
assistance activities]{.underline}. [According to DOD and State
officials, no sanctioned U.S. government inventory of security
cooperation and security assistance efforts
exists]{.underline}.**[4]{.underline}** In this report, we provide a
fiscal year 2016 inventory of DOD security cooperation and State
security assistance efforts that may be used by the U.S. government to
build foreign partners' capacity to address security-related threats,
including each effort's name, description, associated legal authorities,
and agency involvement as required by the associated authorities. This
inventory includes efforts that have building partner capacity (BPC) to
address security-related threats as a primary goal as well as efforts
that may have BPC as an ancillary goal or effect.

**\[FOOTNOTE 4\]**

**[4]{.underline}** [Various government and nongovernment entities have
compiled **lists of security cooperation** efforts, including security
assistance efforts administered by]{.underline} the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency ([DSCA]{.underline}), [but **none of the lists** are
sanctioned by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy as
both **current** and **complete**]{.underline}.

**\[/FOOTNOTE 4\]**

[To develop an inventory of]{.underline} BPC [security
cooperation]{.underline} and security assistance [efforts, we reviewed
data, documents, and reports from DOD, State, RAND, and the
Congressional Research Service (CRS); conducted searches of laws; and
reviewed prior GAO reports. We interviewed DOD, State, RAND, and CRS
officials about their research on, and listings of, security
cooperation]{.underline} and security assistance [efforts]{.underline}
used for BPC [and the efforts' associated authorities; the methodologies
they used; and the limitations they encountered]{.underline}. The
efforts we selected for our inventory comprise what our sources referred
to as "programs," "subprograms," "tools," "funding accounts,"
"authorities," or "activities." We used "efforts" as the most inclusive
possible term, because the DOD and DOD-sponsored sources we consulted
used undefined and varying terminology---for example, sometimes using
terms such as "programs" and "activities" interchangeably and sometimes
including funds and the names of authorities---and because these sources
and [DOD officials did not provide DOD-sanctioned definitions of the
program and subprogram levels for security cooperation
programs]{.underline}. We broadly defined building partner capacity to
include efforts that were intended solely to build partner security
capacity as well as those that could have a partial or ancillary effect
on partner security capacity. For example, [we included military
exercises, training, and equipment as well as]{.underline} BPC-related
[personnel exchanges and military contacts]{.underline}. [To focus our
inventory on]{.underline} BPC efforts to address [security-related
threats, we excluded efforts whose sole purpose was humanitarian,
health, disaster, or development assistance]{.underline}. To eliminate
duplicative and expired efforts, we compared the data we obtained from
these sources and reviewed associated authorities. We worked with DOD
and State officials to resolve any discrepancies, to add additional
efforts, and to group subefforts with overall efforts when the officials
made such information available. See enclosure I for further information
about our objective, scope, and methodology.

We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to March 2017 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.

#### "Security cooperation" encompasses "security assistance"

**Cooper 21** R. Clarke Cooper, nonresident senior fellow with the
Atlantic Council, former assistant secretary at the Department of State,
and US Army combat veteran, "American security cooperation needs an
'integrity check'," New Atlanticist, The Atlantic Council, 9-3-2021,
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/american-security-cooperation-needs-an-integrity-check/>
/GoGreen!

Since World War II, US presidents have understood the tremendous value
of security cooperation, prompting them to invest in alliances and
partnerships. These are, after all, significant components of US
national security, and as President Joe Biden recently noted, "America's
alliances are our greatest asset."

Yet successful **[security cooperation]{.underline}**---which [includes
**arms transfers**, **training**, **security assistance**, **treaties**,
or **agreements**]{.underline}---is built around two key principles:
trust and integrity of commitment, both of which are at risk today
thanks to the haphazard US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

#### It encompasses "security assistance" -- here is a diagram

security interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities
for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide U.S. forces
with peacetime and contingency access]{.underline} to a HN. Security
cooperation, security assistance, and FID are closely related. DOD
Directive 5132.03, DOD Policy and Responsibilities Relating to Security
Cooperation, sets the policy and assigns responsibilities under the GEF,
10 USC, 22 USC, Executive Orders, Guidance for the Development of the
Force, and policies relating to the administration of security
cooperation, to include security assistance. Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) Instruction 3141.01D, Management and Review of
Campaign and Contingency Plans, states that "The Joint Staff Director
for Strategic Plans and Policy, (DJ-5), is responsible for developing
recommendations on strategy, strategic concepts, and political-military
matters to include security cooperation, security assistance, and
stability, security, transition, and reconstruction operations."

1-23. The GEF consolidates and integrates DOD planning guidance into an
overarching document that supersedes security cooperation guidance. The
GEF transitions DOD planning from a contingency-centric approach to a
strategy-centric approach with a broader theater emphasis on the
regional ends as opposed to the means. The GEF places emphasis on
steady-state activities to achieve end states and objectives that
reflect the centrality of security cooperation activities listed in
national strategy documents. The centerpiece of the GEF is the
requirement for combatant commanders to develop joint campaigns that
translate national and theater strategy into "joint" operational
concepts to ensure steady-state activities and operations are integrated
and synchronized for achieving and attaining the regional or functional
end states specified in the GEF (JP 5-0, Joint Operation Planning).
Joint operation planning includes all activities that must be
accomplished to develop courses of action (COAs) for contingency or
anticipated operations---the mobilization, deployment, employment,
sustainment, redeployment, and demobilization of forces. Planners
recommend and commanders define criteria for the termination of joint
operations, and they link these criteria to the transition to
stabilization and achievement of the end state (JP 3-05, Special
Operations). The Joint Operation Planning and Execution System (JOPES)
process and the joint operation planning process promote coherent
planning across all levels of war and command echelons, easing the
transition to crisis action planning. Joint planning integrates military
actions with those of other instruments of national power (diplomatic,
informational, military, and economic) and multinational partners in
time, space, and purpose to achieve a specified end state. The
military's contribution to national strategic planning consists of joint
strategic planning and its three subsets---

 Security cooperation planning.

 Joint operation planning.

 Force planning.

1-24. The GEF provides goals and activities for specific regions and
provides the overarching framework for many FID-related activities.
[**Security cooperation** tools and resources are as
follows:]{.underline}

 [Multinational education]{.underline}.

 [Multinational exercises]{.underline}.

 Multinational experimentation.

 [Multinational training]{.underline}.

 [Counternarcotics assistance]{.underline}.

 [Counter/nonproliferation]{.underline}.

 [Defense and military contracts]{.underline}.

 [Defense support to public diplomacy]{.underline}.

 Facilities and [infrastructure projects]{.underline}.

 Humanitarian assistance.

 [Intelligence cooperation]{.underline}.

 [Information sharing]{.underline}.

 International [armaments cooperation]{.underline}.

 **[Security assistance]{.underline}**.

 Other programs and activities.

1-25. [Security assistance is a group of programs authorized by the
FAA]{.underline} of 1961 (as amended), [and the]{.underline} Arms Export
Control Act ([AECA]{.underline}) of 1976 (as amended), [or other related
statutes by which the United States provides defense articles, military
training, and other defense-related services by grant, loan, credit, or
cash sales in furtherance of national policies and
objectives]{.underline}. Figure 1-3, page 1-12, depicts the relationship
of security cooperation, security assistance, and FID. [Security
assistance is an element of security cooperation funded and authorized
by DOS to be administered by DOD and DSCA]{.underline}.

1-26. Security assistance is a principal instrument in the U.S. FID
effort. Like FID, [security assistance is a broad, encompassing topic
and includes efforts of civilian agencies, as well as those of the
military. Security assistance provides defense materiel, military
training, and other defense-related services by grant, loan, credit, or
cash sales]{.underline}. The express goal of the USG security assistance
is the expansion of U.S. national policies and objectives by enhancing
the ability of lesser-developed nations to remain secure from primarily
external, but also internal threats. The post-Cold War paradigm in
security assistance is for nations supported by the program to have
regional parity to maintain balances of power and internal stability.
Overall, only a portion (in terms of both numbers of programs and
budgets) of the security assistance effort encompasses FID, but that
portion is a large part of the overall FID effort. The FAA of 1961 (as
amended) and the AECA of 1976 (as amended) authorize the security
assistance program. The program is under the supervision and general
direction of the DOS. Figure 1-3 shows security assistance as a complete
subset of security cooperation.

DOS]{.underline}. DOD Manual 5105.38-M, Security Assistance Management
Manual (SAMM), and Army Regulation (AR) 12-1, Security Assistance,
Training, and Export Policy, describe the programs in detail. The major
types of DOD Army security assistance programs and activities are---

 FMS.

Note: FMS are either funded by the customer or through a
foreign-military financing arrangement, credit, or guaranteed loan.

 Foreign military construction services.

 FMS credit.

 Leases.

 Military Assistance Program.

 IMET.

 Drawdown.

The major types of DOS security assistance programs are---

 Economic support fund.

 Peacekeeping operations.

 International narcotics control and law enforcement.

 Nonproliferation, antiterrorism, demining, and related programs.

 Commercial export sales licensed under the AECA of 1976 (as amended).

1-28. The DOS provides financial support to international peacekeeping
operations, a subset of peace operations, through a peacekeeping
operations fund. These components, combined with the economic support
fund and commercial sales licensed under the AECA, are security
assistance tools that the United States can use to further its national
interests and support the overall FID effort.

#### "Cooperation" encompasses "assistance"

Affairs, Congressional Research Service, "Security Assistance and
Cooperation: Shared Responsibility of the Departments of State and

Terminology

[The two terms most commonly used today for assistance to foreign
military and security forces are "security assistance" and "security
cooperation." **Security assistance is the term most frequently used,
regardless of the agency** providing that assistance.]{.underline}

**[There is no State Department definition for security
assistance]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} annual **[State
Department]{.underline}** congressional budget justification (CBJ),
however, [lists six budget accounts under the heading "International
Security Assistance." These accounts, with their underlying **Title 22**
authorities (the 1961 **FAA** and the **AECA**), are **commonly
regarded** as the State Department's **security assistance**
portfolio]{.underline}.

[**DOD formally defines security assistance as** the group of State
Department 1961 **FAA** and **AECA** programs that a DOD organization,
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (**DSCA**), **administers**.
These include programs conducted under two of the State Department
international security assistance accounts and attendant authorities, as
well as programs conducted under four related 1961 FAA and AECA
authorities]{.underline}.

[**DOD** uses the **overarching term** **"security cooperation"** to
denote the **State Department security assistance** **administered by
DSCA**]{.underline} through which the U.S. government furnishes defense
articles, military training, and other defense-related services, [**as
well as all other DOD interactions** with foreign defense
establishments]{.underline}. The purposes of the interactions with
foreign defense establishments defined as security cooperation are to
"build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multilateral operations, and provide US forces with
peacetime and contingency access to a host nation."8

### SC = Includes Treaties

#### "Security cooperation" includes treaties

/GoGreen!

Since World War II, US presidents have understood the tremendous value
of security cooperation, prompting them to invest in alliances and
partnerships. These are, after all, significant components of US
national security, and as President Joe Biden recently noted, "America's
alliances are our greatest asset."

Yet successful **[security cooperation]{.underline}**---which [includes
**arms transfers**, **training**, **security assistance**, **treaties**,
or **agreements**]{.underline}---is built around two key principles:
trust and integrity of commitment, both of which are at risk today
thanks to the haphazard US withdrawal from Afghanistan.

In the realm of [**security cooperation** --- **peacetime** activities
undertaken by the U.S. armed services with other armed forces and
countries]{.underline} --- the U.S. Army's current planning process is
exceedingly complex, involving a multitude of actors, problematic
incentive systems, an incomplete information exchange, and a lack of
effective measures of effectiveness. Even some of the stakeholders
understand only certain aspects of the process and/or have only partial
visibility into it. The drivers and demanders of peacetime cooperative
activities undertaken by the U.S. Army with other countries and
militaries (Army International Affairs, or AIA) tend to have an
incomplete understanding of the resourcing problems and the tradeoffs
involved in making AIA choices. In turn, Headquarters, Department of the
Army (HQDA) --- the supplier of AIA resources --- has an incomplete
understanding of the benefits of AIA, and the Army's own resourcing
tools are not easily amenable to an in-depth understanding of the
resources it commits to AIA. The demand for AIA is fundamentally
predicated on the amount of AIA supply provided by HQDA, as opposed to
the latter being the product of policy, strategy, and resource guidance.
Indeed, incrementalism and continuity, rather than policy and strategy,
are the principal driving agents in the development of AIA resource
priorities. In the post-September 11 security environment, the planning
system of AIA needs greater flexibility and efficiency as a crucial
component of the global war on terrorism. The need to have flexibility
and adaptability in security cooperation, and to seize opportunities
that may be short-lived, has made reform of the security cooperation
planning and implementation process essential.

Definitions and Scope

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [**Official U.S. government definitions** of **security
cooperation** are **very broad**]{.underline}. One definition from [the
D]{.underline}efense [S]{.underline}ecurity [C]{.underline}ooperation
[A]{.underline}gency [states that security cooperation]{.underline}

> comprises all activities undertaken by the Department of Defense (DoD)
> to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United
> States to achieve strategic objectives. It [includes **all DoD
> interactions** with foreign defense and security
> establishments]{.underline}, including all DoD-administered Security
> Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense and security
> relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests, including all
> international armaments cooperation activities and SA activities;
> develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
> multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
> contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions **clearly include** almost **any security-related
activity** for **any purpose**]{.underline}. To scope the focus of the
study, [we reviewed official **state documents** and strategies and the
**literature** on security cooperation to identify]{.underline} 11 types
of activities**[:]{.underline}**

1\. **[military aid]{.underline}**, which includes funding through the
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles
program, and other grants and loans

2\. **[arms sales]{.underline}** and transfers,4 such as U.S. arms sales
through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) programs

3\. military capacity-building, such as U.S. activities under Section
1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and Sections and
2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the **[train and
equip]{.underline}** authority)

4\. **[education and training]{.underline}**, including international
military education and training (IMET), professional military education
(PME), and regional centers

5\. **[personnel exchanges]{.underline}**, such as U.S. activities under
the Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State Partnership
Program

6\. **[military exercises]{.underline}**, both bilateral and
multilateral and those that involve foreign partners

7\. access-related agreements, such as status of forces agreements
(**[SOFAs]{.underline}**) and agreements related to base access [and
**information-sharing**]{.underline}

8\. armament-related agreements, such as those for
**[co-development]{.underline}** of systems and for research,
development, test, and evaluation activities

9\. **[sustainment]{.underline}** of donor-nation equipment by the
donor, the partner, or third parties

10\. **[institutional capacity--building]{.underline}** to strengthen
the partner institutions that support security services

11\. [**humanitarian assistance** and **disaster relief**]{.underline}
(HA/DR), which offers support for efforts to relieve suffering.

[These categories offered a consistent template for gathering
data]{.underline} across our various study components. A major challenge
was that reliable and consistent data on each of the 11 categories were
not available for all the competitors---not even for the United States.
[**Especially** at the **unclassified** level, **there is simply no
comprehensive roster of security cooperation activities** by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, and neither China nor Russia
publishes inclusive data sets of its programs. An additional challenge
was that, in some cases, the different countries define the categories
somewhat differently, so we could not develop data on entirely
comparable sets of security cooperation activities.

C. Evolving Terminology for Peacetime Engagements

Military operations of any scale require precise language to communicate
information efficiently.\[82\] Common sense dictates that terms and
concepts applicable to a joint environment are standard and well-known
between the services in order to foster efficient communication.
Confusion and general misunderstandings result when military terms are
used improperly or when their evolving definitions outpace doctrine. The
[DoD recognizes the importance of standardizing its
terminology]{.underline} by instructing the military departments to
identify, delete, modify, and incorporate standard definitions.\[83\]
[Nonetheless, the **misuse** and **misunderstanding** of key terms
within **security cooperation** is **pervasive**]{.underline}.\[84\]

[Security cooperation is now a term that encompasses "any program,
activity]{.underline} (including an exercise), [or interaction of the
\[DoD\] with the security establishment of a foreign
country]{.underline} to achieve a \[strategic\] purpose . . .
\[.\]"\[85\] The DoD assigns such strategic importance to security
cooperation that, with the help of Congress, it created the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to direct and guide the execution of
all DoD security cooperation programs.\[86\] The DSCA helps administer
security cooperation, now a multi-billion dollar industry within the
annual Defense appropriation.\[87\] With all the money and strategic
brainpower pouring into security cooperation, [newcomers to the field
may **presume fully-vetted, standardized terms** and definitions.
However, this **could not be further from reality**]{.underline}.

[Members of the **DoD** **frequently mischaracterize** **security
cooperation** or **outright disagree** with respect to its **doctrinal
definition**]{.underline}.\[88\] For example, the 2010 National Security
Strategy (NSS) used the term security cooperation to include rebuilding
damaged infrastructure and establishing conditions necessary to end
military operations in Afghanistan.\[89\] [With the exception of combat
operations, it would seem that almost **any military action** could fit
under the]{.underline} 2010 NSS's [version of **security
cooperation**]{.underline}.\[90\] Nevertheless, if [**security
cooperation** is **in fact** **an evolving term in the
DoD**]{.underline}, making sense of the authorities under which the
military executes security cooperation events is even more
troublesome.\[91\] This is especially true when authorities are based
upon a set of specific terms. Hence, [with **doctrine lagging** behind
and accompanied by **undefined terminology**, **no authority in the
realm of security cooperation is more ambiguous** than the authority for
military-to-military contacts]{.underline}.\[92\] With ambiguity
surrounding military-to-military contacts, planners and lawyers should
defer to commanders to decide the best way to employ these strategic
interaction events. The fate of 10 U.S.C. §168 and its ultimate repeal
is illustrative of this point.

Today's **[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}** is no Cold
War alliance. Few developments illustrate NATO's capacity for adaptation
more than its 21st century role in Afghanistan.1 NATO allies invoked the
collective defense provision---Article 5---of its founding treaty for
the first and only time just one day after the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.2 Few present at the signing of the North Atlantic
Treaty in 1949 could have imagined it would be invoked by European
countries and Canada seeking to support the United States or that the
Alliance's largest and longest military operation would occur in central
Asia. Fewer still might have predicted NATO allies would agree to the
mission so soon after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, a crisis the
then US ambassador to NATO described as a "near death experience" for
the Alliance.3 Yet NATO assumed control of the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) in 2003 and has remained in Afghanistan for the
better part of two decades.

As the United States has begun negotiating a political settlement to the
Afghanistan conflict with a view to the eventual withdrawal of
international forces there, an assessment from the overall NATO
perspective will complement the national initiatives.4 This effort will
also support ongoing efforts to reassess NATO's priorities in the face
of other security challenges.5

Although NATO has undertaken formal studies of its activities in
Afghanistan, recent scholarship by Heidi Hardt, Jörg Noll, and
Sebastiaan Rietjens cast doubt on the efficacy of formal lessons learned
processes in international organizations generally and in NATO
specifically.6 This article offers an external and an unofficial
assessment of the Alliance's efforts and provides initial suppositions.
In sum, NATO's impact in Afghanistan may not have been enough to
mitigate national shortcomings or to achieve victory on its own, but it
was significant and positive. The Alliance's adaptability and highly
institutionalized character are at the root of these contributions.

Moreover, the mission in Afghanistan affected NATO in ways that promoted
allied political cohesion, organizational effectiveness, and military
interoperability. The chief implications of these findings are that
while national political leadership and strategy formulation remain
paramount in war, NATO remains a proven and effective instrument of
organizing and implementing coordinated multinational efforts. The most
important lesson learned from NATO in Afghanistan may therefore be about
NATO's more general value to the United States and other members.

NATO: Alliance and International Organization

[In contrast to national assessments, this analysis focuses on the
formal institutions of the Alliance. **NATO** is **unique among
alliances** in that it is **not only** a **treaty-based agreement among
member states**, **but also** an **international organization**---and a
**highly institutionalized** one at that]{.underline}. Since its early
years, [NATO has been **comprised of** a permanently staffed **formal
political headquarters** supported by a **network of military and
civilian organizations**]{.underline}. Particularly noteworthy is NATO's
integrated joint multinational military structure, a unique innovation
without equivalent among other alliances or international organizations.

This integration, capped by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium, extends through various echelons and included
the ISAF headquarters and other NATO structures in Afghanistan.7
[Thus]{.underline}, for this article, [**"NATO" refers to the various
formal institutions** and **not the group of allied
countries**]{.underline}. [Likewise, the **focus** is on the
**collaborative conduct**]{.underline} and not that of the United
States, other allies or partners, the government of Afghanistan, or
other regional actors. Nor does the article address the efficacy of
counterinsurgency warfare.

International relations theory would emphasize the formal institutions
of NATO have very weak independent power and agency.

But although NATO consists of such formal institutions, the Alliance
remains an alliance among states. [**All decisions** at NATO
Headquarters are taken by **consensus** among member states]{.underline}
(which will soon number 30). Politics among those countries happens, and
the relative influence of individual member states is closely associated
with their power. [**NATO's institutions matter** chiefly because of how
they facilitate and **structure the relations** among the
states]{.underline}. [Like any other international organization, states
may derive value from such institutions because they provide benefits
such as establishing predictable structures and routines for
decision-making; increasing information sharing; improving efficiency
and reducing transaction costs; and defining roles, status, and
identity]{.underline}. [The **most important questions**]{.underline}
for NATO [in the context of assessing its role]{.underline} in the
Afghanistan conflict [is whether and how well it has performed these
functions]{.underline}.

The first section will examine the value of NATO as a security partner
for Japan from the following four perspectives: 1) a political partner;
2) an operational partner; 3) as a means of cooperation with the US; and
4) a multilateral school. The second section will use a similar method
to examine the significance of security cooperation with the EU, viewing
it from the following three perspectives: 1) a political partner; 2) an
operational partner; and 3) as a "non-American" partner.

There are two things to be mentioned before going into substantial
discussions below. First, from the perspective of "mutually using the
other," it would be necessary to examine the value of Japan as a partner
for Europe. However, it goes beyond the scope of this article, which is
focused on the Japanese side of the story. That said, it needs to be
mentioned that it is necessary for Japan to be prepared and willing to
be used by Europe as long as Japan wants to use Europe and that letting
Europeans understand the value of Japan as a partner is in Japan's
interest.

Second, [this article focuses on **cooperation** **with
NATO**]{.underline} and the EU[; however, that **by no means implies**
that **security cooperation** **with individual countries**]{.underline}
such as the UK, France, and Germany [is insignificant]{.underline}. [For
a long time, the majority of]{.underline} dialogue and
[cooperation]{.underline} between Japan and Europe [in the areas of

result]{.underline}, the accumulation of knowledge and experience in
Japan with regard to [**cooperation** **with NATO**]{.underline} and the
EU [remain shallow **compared** to **bilateral** relations **with

will focus on NATO and the EU.

1\. NATO's transformation and the development of Japan--NATO
cooperation: How to use NATO9

\(1\) NATO as a political partner

From a Japanese perspective, NATO can be seen, first, as a political
partner, meaning a partner with which to have political dialogue. When
visiting NTO and addressing the North Atlantic Council (NAC), both
Foreign Minister Taro Aso (May 2006) and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
(January 2007) spent a great deal of time talking about the security
environment in Asia, including the abduction and other issues of North
Korea as well as China's military buildup.10 Abe directly requested the
understanding and support of NATO members concerning Japan's stance on
the North Korean abduction and other issues. This illustrates the fact
that, for Japan, dialogue with NATO is a new venue to acquire
understanding and support from Europe for its position on problems
related to politics and security in Asia.

With regard to political and security dialogue between Japan and Europe,
in addition to traditional bilateral frameworks between Japan and major
European countries like the UK, France and Germany, there is now a
channel between Japan and the EU (to be discussed later). Dialogue with
NATO provides a new venue for discussion. In addition to Prime Minister
and ministeriallevel visits to NATO (meetings with the NATO Secretary
General and the NAC) and dialogue with the NATO Secretary General during
his visits to Japan, at the officials' level there is the annual Japan
--NATO High-Level Consultation. Moreover, in addition to dialogue with
NATO officials ---the International Staff and the International Military
Staff--- ad hoc meetings are held from time to time between Japanese
officials and representatives of the member states' delegations to NATO
in the context of the Political Committees (PC), Policy Cooperation
Groups (PCG), and other frameworks depending on the topics to be
discussed, such as the security situation in East Asia, Central Asia,
and missile defense. In recent years, the NAC and the Secretary General
have issued statements condemning North Korea's nuclear and missile
tests, which Japan appreciates a lot, showing one aspect of NATO's value
as a political partner.11 NATO is a forum suitable for Japan to discuss
Asian security and other security-related issues mainly because many
security experts, both civilian and military, are assembled and deal
with various security problems on a daily basis.

Japan is not alone in seeing NATO as a political partner. NATO is often
described as the strongest and the most successful military alliance in
history and encompassing all major powers from North America and Europe.
Thus, NATO inevitably carries a unique weight in international security
and world politics. That weight may even be heavier than NATO itself is
aware.12 In fact, demand from non-members to conduct political dialogue
with NATO has been increasing. At the same time, countries that do not
necessarily have positive perceptions of NATO or that do not share
fundamental values with the Alliance often see the strengthening of
relations between NATO and non-members with concern and suspicion. For
instance, Russia and China often react with vigilance when Japan and
NATO cooperate. This partly comes from their genuine concerns over the
strengthening of concrete military cooperation between Japan and NATO,
but it also has to do with their recognition of NATO's political weight.
Moreover, these countries view Japan--EU and Japan --NATO cooperation
differently. Put simply, they react more negatively to the latter than
the former. This fact demonstrates that NATO carries a distinctive
profile as a political actor that differs from that of the EU.

Nevertheless, it goes without saying that NATO is a military alliance
based on collective defense. NATO is not supposed to be aiming to expand
its political and diplomatic influence as a political actor in
international relations. This is how NATO differs from the EU, which has
been trying to construct a common foreign, security, and defense policy.
At the same time, however, NATO is not an alliance that concerns
military affairs alone. NATO has long labeled itself a politicalmilitary
alliance, and even its founding North Atlantic Treaty emphasizes
political and economic cooperation among the Allies (Parties).13

\(2\) NATO as an operational partner

NATO today can be characterized as an "alliance in action." In addition
to large-scale operations in Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (ISAF), NATO
is currently conducting an antiterrorism operation in the Mediterranean
(OAE), antipiracy measures off the coast of Somalia, and a training
mission in Iraq (NTM-I). Furthermore, from March to October 2011, NATO
conducted an operation over Libya. Many non-NATO countries, as well as
NATO Allies, are contributing troops to those operations and missions.
In the case of ISAF, for instance, in addition to all of the 28 NATO
countries, a total of around 20 non-members are participating as
Non-NATO Troop Contributing Nations (NNTCNs). The presence of non-member
contributors has grown considerably in the context of ISAF over the past
several years.14 In the past, Australia and New Zealand had contributed
troops to NATO-led operations in the former Yugoslavia, such as in
Bosnia in the 1990s. However, the current level of non-members'
involvement in NATO-led operations is truly a new phenomenon. One reason
behind this is the expansion of NATO's operational commitments beyond
the capacity of its members. In other words, it is impossible for the
Alliance to conduct all the operations alone as a self-sufficient
entity. At the same time, as most former communist countries in Europe
have already become members of the Alliance, the weight of the countries
outside the Euro--Atlantic region that used to be referred to as contact
countries ---Japan, Australia, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, etc.---
is increasing instead. From NATO's point of view, cooperation with new
partners is in essence an "import of support" 15 and NATO naturally
welcomes countries with the will and capabilities to contribute to the
operations that it leads.

On the other hand, operational cooperation with NATO is often an
effective means for nonmembers in terms of enhancing their efforts in
international peace and security, not least in the context of
international peace operations. Most of these operations today are
conducted multilaterally. What is more, looking at global trends in
international peace operations, it is clear that the weight of United
Nations-led peacekeeping operations (PKO) has been relatively decreasing
in recent years. In its place is a growing presence of peace operations
led by regional organizations such as NATO, the EU, and the African
Union (AU).16 While the activities of the AU are limited to
intra-regional operations on the African continent, NATO and EU
operations (other than territorial defense mission by NATO) are
basically assumed to take place outside of their member states.17

As a result of the expanding operational engagements of NATO and the EU
outside of Europe, other countries including Japan often find themselves
in a situation where they need to cooperate with NATO and the EU whether
they like it or not. When the ISAF operation in Afghanistan was launched
at the end of 2001, it was commanded on a half-year rotation by
countries with the will and capacity to command. However, due to cost
and complexities related to the establishment and maintenance of the
headquarters, NATO took over command in August 2003.18 Furthermore, ISAF
later expanded its area of responsibility and came to cover the whole
country. As a result, those who were deploying troops in Afghanistan had
no choice but to cooperate with NATO as long as they wanted to continue
their engagement. Seen from a different angle, it can also be said that
countries can use NATO as a framework through which to participate in
international efforts. Without such a framework, small to medium-sized
countries may not able to make contributions.

Nevertheless, there are various ways to pursue operational cooperation
with NATO. Potential contributors could complete official procedures,
including concluding a participation agreement with NATO, become a
troop-contributing country, and then deploy troops under the ISAF
command, or they could cooperate locally via individual arrangements
made with other countries already active in the area (without having
official relations with NATO).19 Theoretically, at least, it is even
possible for those countries to conduct a completely independent
operation on its own in Afghanistan. However, regardless of how
self-contained the activities are, the necessity to coordinate on issues
such as the division of roles with ISAF will of course come up, and it
is practically impossible to assume that the countries that endeavor to
send troops to Afghanistan could conduct its own activities without
relying on the capabilities and various infrastructure of ISAF at all,
including in extremis support and security information. Furthermore,
even assuming it is feasible, it will not be the most efficient way to
use the limited amount of resources available. In sum, it is not only in
NATO's interest, but also non-NATO troop contributors' interest to
cooperate with each other. Former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop
Scheffer succinctly pointed out that, "NATO is a framework that they
\[nonmembers\] can use to make their own efforts more effective." 20
Furthermore, if a country completes official procedures with NATO and
takes position as an official ISAF troop contributing nation, they can
participate in various levels of ISAF meetings, receive more
information, and get more involved in policy-shaping.

For a number of constitutional, legal and domestic political reasons, it
is very difficult for the SDF to operate under the command of NATO.21
Short of coming under NATO's command, however, various options are
conceivable for the SDF to work with NATO in the areas where it
operates. At the same time, operational cooperation with NATO does not
need to be limited to the military domain alone. In Afghanistan, since
2007 Japan has provided humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in
cooperation with PRTs, and since 2009 has dispatched development experts
(civilian assistance teams) to the Lithuania-led PRT in Chaghcharan,
Ghor province.22 Assistance from Japan was of great value for Lithuania,
a country which does not have much funding and experience in development
assistance. From a Japanese point of view, the importance of this scheme
comes from the fact that it enables Japan to expand the geographical
reach of its development assistance beyond those areas where an Embassy
or the Japanese aid agency (JICA) are already present. Without the
cooperation of the Lithuania-led PRT, it is easy to imagine that Japan
would not have been able to operate in a remote province like Ghor.
Moreover, Japan and NATO concluded a security agreement in June 2010,
which allows Japan and NATO to share classified information with each
other.23 This is expected to be a foundation for deeper dialogue and
practical cooperation between Japan and NATO.24

\(3\) NATO as another venue of cooperation with the United States

The comparative advantage that [**cooperation** **with
NATO**]{.underline} offers Japan, [as **opposed** to **bilateral**
**cooperation** **with major European countries** and with the
EU]{.underline}, is the fact that the US, Japan's only formal ally, is
part of NATO. For all NATO Allies excluding the US, what NATO means is
essentially an alliance with the US. When NATO was founded within the
context of the Cold War, it was primarily seen as a means to secure US
commitment to defend Western Europe. Moreover, for former communist
nations that joined NATO after the end of the Cold War, the NATO
membership was synonymous with receiving a commitment from the US for
collective defense, exemplified by Article 5 of the North Atlantic
Treaty. For those reasons, NATO is usually conceived in the context of
policy toward the US in many countries.

### NATO = Members

#### "NATO" refers to [member countries]{.underline} -- the "North Atlantic Council" is the [institution]{.underline}

Established during the Cold War, [**NATO** is a transatlantic security
alliance **composed of** thirty **member countries**]{.underline},
including the United States.

NATO has focused on deterring Russian aggression in recent years, but it
has also conducted security operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and
Somalia.

Amid Russia's 2022 offensive in Ukraine, many NATO allies are providing
Kyiv with extraordinary quantities of military supplies, and the
alliance could expand to include Finland and Sweden.

Introduction

Founded in 1949 as a bulwark against Soviet aggression, [the **North
Atlantic Treaty Organization** (NATO)]{.underline} remains the pillar of
U.S.-Europe military cooperation. An expanding bloc of NATO allies has
taken on a broad range of missions since the close of the Cold War, many
well beyond the Euro-Atlantic region, in countries such as Afghanistan
and Libya.

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a nonmember, in early 2022 has
shaken Europe's security architecture and prompted a major reevaluation
of NATO members' foreign policies and defense commitments. The threat
from Russia has generated the greatest tensions with the alliance in the
post-Cold War era. It is driving up defense spending and pushing some
longtime NATO partners, namely Finland and Sweden, to seek formal
membership, which would mark another historic expansion of the alliance.

A Post--Cold War Pivot

After the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Western leaders intensely
debated the direction of the transatlantic alliance. Some in the Bill
Clinton administration initially opposed expanding NATO, wary it would
upset relations with President Boris Yeltsin's fragile government in
Russia and complicate other U.S. foreign policy objectives, such as
nuclear arms control. Others favored expansion as a way to extend NATO's
security umbrella to the east and consolidate democratic gains in the
former Soviet bloc.

European members were also split on the issue. The United Kingdom feared
NATO's expansion would dilute the alliance, while France believed it
would give NATO (and the United States) too much influence. Paris hoped
to integrate former Soviet states via European institutions.

As a first step, Clinton chose to develop a new NATO initiative called
the Partnership for Peace (PfP), which would be open to all former
Warsaw Pact members, as well as non-European countries. Seeing this
nonmembership framework as a means to allay some of Russia's concerns
about alliance expansion, NATO launched PfP at its annual summit in
1994. More than two dozen countries, including Georgia, Russia, and
Ukraine, joined in the following months.

However, Clinton soon began speaking publicly \[PDF\] about expanding
NATO's membership, saying in the Czech Republic just days after the
launch of PfP that "the question is no longer whether NATO will take on
new members but when and how." Yeltsin warned Western leaders at a
conference later that year that "Europe, even before it has managed to
shrug off the legacy of the Cold War, is risking encumbering itself with
a cold peace."

Beyond Collective Defense

Many U.S. officials felt that a post--Cold War vision for NATO needed to
look beyond its core defense commitments---Article V of the North
Atlantic Treaty states that "an armed attack against one or more
\[member states\] in Europe or North America shall be considered an
attack against them all"---and focus on confronting challenges outside
its membership. "The common denominator of all the new security problems
in Europe is that they all lie beyond NATO's current borders," said
influential U.S. Senator Richard Lugar in a 1993 speech.

The breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s and the onset of ethnic
conflict tested the alliance on this point almost immediately. What
began as a mission to impose a UN-sanctioned no-fly zone over Bosnia and
Herzegovina evolved into a bombing campaign on Bosnian Serb forces that
many military analysts say was essential to ending the conflict. In
April 1994, during Operation Deny Flight, NATO conducted its first
combat operations in its forty-year history, shooting down four Bosnian
Serb aircraft.

**[NATO\'s Structure]{.underline}**

Headquartered in Brussels, [NATO is a consensus-based alliance in which
decisions must be unanimous. **However**, **individual states** or
**subgroups** of allies **can initiate action** outside NATO's
auspices]{.underline}. For instance, the United States, France, and the
United Kingdom began policing a UN-sanctioned no-fly zone in Libya in
early 2011 and, within days, transferred command of the operation to
NATO once Turkey's concerns had been allayed. [Member states are not
required to participate in every NATO operation]{.underline}; Germany
and Poland declined to contribute directly to the campaign in Libya.

NATO's military structure comprises two strategic commands: the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, located near Mons, Belgium, and the
Allied Command Transformation, located in Norfolk, Virginia. The supreme
allied commander Europe oversees all NATO military operations and is
always a U.S. flag or general officer; U.S. Air Force General Tod D.
Wolters currently holds this position. Although the alliance has an
integrated command, most forces remain under their respective national
authorities until NATO operations commence.

NATO's secretary-general, Norwegian politician Jens Stoltenberg, is
serving a second four-year term as the bloc's chief administrator and
international envoy. However, NATO leaders extended his service for one
additional year (until September 2023) amid the war in Ukraine. [The
alliance's principal **political body** is the **North Atlantic
Council**, which is composed of high-level delegates from each member
state]{.underline}.

Human rights violations as outlined in broad terms in the 2011 World
Report, and pressure from organizations such as Human Rights Watch most
certainly add to the international pressure on NATO to intervene. This
has led to the discovery that military power may not be a useful
instrument in dealing with specific country by country issues in the
region. [**NATO** is a **group** of democratic **countries** who in turn
**each** have an **individual** agenda]{.underline} when dealing in the
Middle East and North Africa, and are tied to the region by their oil
dependency; but protection of human rights as justification for military
intervention must be across the board or not at all. Military
intervention in Libya was completed swiftly based largely on the
economic incentives of NATO's democratic powers, whereas in Syria, NATO
has been immobilized as more people die everyday.

[We **do not find any ambiguity**]{.underline} in KRS 341.070(1). It is
our opinion that [the key word]{.underline} in the statute [is the word
\"in,\"]{.underline} preceding the words \"each of three calendar
quarters\", and if the word is [accorded its ordinary and **common

employment.

[According to **Webster\'s**]{.underline} New International
[**Dictionary**, the word \"in,\" used with relation to a period of
time, means \"during the course of.\" The same meaning, expressed in
another way, would be \"**within the limits** or duration
of.\"]{.underline} Employing this meaning, the statute says that an
employer is subject to the Act if, during the course of, or within the
limits or duration of each of three calendar quarters, he had in covered
employment four or more workers, to each of whom the required amount of
wages was paid. This clearly means that the employment need not be
simultaneous.

**[Obviously, the word \"in\" does not mean
\"throughout\"]{.underline}** or \"for the entire period of,\" because
then there would be no point in adding the requirement of the payment of
a minimum of \$50 in wages. In these times, no worker employed for a
full calendar quarter would be paid less than \$50 in wages.

The appellant seeks to read into the statute the words \"at the same
time,\" following the words \"had in covered employment\". There is no
justification for this, unless the word \"in\" means \"during any one
period of time in.\" We are not aware of any authority for ascribing
such a meaning to the word \"in\".

What do prevalent definitions of artificial intelligence illuminate and
what do they hide? [The **most common** approach is defining
intelligence as what human beings do when they reason
cognitively]{.underline}. This conceptual strategy distinguishes between
human (or human and animal) activities and the activities of machines---
calling the latter "artificial." It then leans the concepts of
artificiality and intelligence against one another, apparently in the
hope that combining one confusing concept with another confusing concept
will result in a clear concept. [For example, the U.S. **Department of
Defense defines artificial intelligence as "the ability of machines to
perform tasks that normally require human intelligence."8**]{.underline}
Similarly, a highly regarded professional publication on the "State of
AI" defines AI as:

> A broad discipline with the goal of creating intelligent machines, as

What is Artificial Intelligence?

[**Artificial intelligence** is commonly defined as]{.underline} the
theory and development of [**computer systems able to perform tasks that
normally require human intelligence**, such as **visual perception**,
**speech recognition**, **decision-making**, and **translation** between
languages]{.underline}. [It can range from]{.underline} weak forms, such
as [**narrow** artificial intelligence, that **processes big data** to
answer basic questions and generate predictions]{.underline} (e.g.,
think of Waze helping you drive home or ad placements online)
[to]{.underline} strong [forms such as "**A**rtificial **G**eneral
**I**ntelligence"]{.underline} and "Artificial Super Intelligence" that
exceed human intelligence, creativity, and adaptability. [Military
applications range from]{.underline} finding optimal **[human-machine
symbiosis]{.underline}**, the centaur Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert
Work speaks about, to **[using increased computer processing power to
replace people]{.underline}** on the battlefield with **[autonomous
attack swarms]{.underline}**.

Short of the promise of driverless cars and robot servants, narrow forms
of artificial intelligence like **[machine learning]{.underline}** are
starting to change sectors ranging from healthcare to logistics. With
respect to public health, Flowminder, a Swedish NGO, uses narrow
artificial intelligence to predict the spread of diseases. In logistics,
machine learning is helping companies make supply chain adjustments,
optimize delivery routes, and design warehouse systems. Vehicle
developers, such as Volvo, apply artificial intelligence to improve
predictive maintenance. Volvo collects data with smart sensors on their
vehicles and applies machine learning techniques to conduct diagnostics
that reduce down time for services and better inform the resupply.

Artificial Intelligence for the Military

While many commercial applications of artificial intelligence are based
on identifying patterns and trends using big data, [most military
applications focus on **autonomous systems**]{.underline}. [Existing
**artificial intelligence** programs in the Department of Defense
include]{.underline} Navy [**unmanned undersea and aerial vehicle**
programs such as the Low-Cost Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Swarming
Technology (LOCUST), and]{.underline} Air Force/DARPA ventures such as
[the Gremlin anti-surface-to-air missile **drone** program]{.underline}.
The Gremlin program involves launching a large number of unmanned
systems from a transport plane that swarm to attack hard targets such as
mobile SAM platforms and C4ISR nodes. Within the Army, [labs are using
artificial intelligence to experiment with **autonomous
vehicles**]{.underline}. Concepts range from larger logistics convoys
composed of one manned vehicle and a large number of autonomous vehicles
to combat formations mixing manned and unmanned platforms.

While the private sector focuses on narrow artificial intelligence
applications that aid decision making and optimize business models, the
military's focus on autonomy arises from a technological bottleneck. A
more advanced version of artificial intelligence than exists today is
likely a necessary development before the military can field autonomous
systems able to adapt to complex, changing environments. This evolution
is especially important for land forces. Ground platforms have more
variables to address than air or naval systems. Jets and submarines do
not have to dodge potholes or jaywalkers. An autonomous system operating
in a future megacity would have to do both under fire. The result is
that autonomous combat vehicles will likely emerge in the air and
maritime domain faster than the ground domain. Yet, that should not stop
continued investment in and experimentation with artificial intelligence
by the Army.

The Army needs apps like Waze, the popular driving program, for war.
Instead of primarily focusing on artificial intelligence for autonomy,
the Army should position itself to leverage commercial applications that
optimize staff processes. Beyond self-driving convoys, which will take
longer than predicted due to legal and safety concerns, the Army [could
use **machine learning** applications across its existing warfighting
functions]{.underline}. [**Image recognition** software]{.underline}
could help intelligence analysts examine video feeds to identify IEDs
and establish patterns of life. Analysis of data sets describing past
enemy operations could provide [probabilistic **forecasts** of enemy
behavior]{.underline}. Software agents could anticipate supply
bottlenecks before they occur and recommend mitigation options. Data
already resident in the operational environment from both commercial
repositories [and]{.underline} data collected by platforms within Army
formations (e.g. [weather data]{.underline} from drones) offers
opportunities to examine factors that may affect operations. [**Natural
language processing** programs]{.underline} could filter social media
and local news outlets to identify common themes and messages. Many
[**administrative functions** could be automated]{.underline} to improve
record keeping and medical readiness. In the extreme, artificial
intelligence could produce a robot general staff capable of recommending
an operational approach, options for allocating resources against
different lines of effort, and ways to deceive the enemy.

[Note that **none** of these functions **would completely remove humans
from the loop**]{.underline}. Rather, the goal would be to super-empower
soldiers. The increase in capability would mean that the Army could
alter its staff organizations and force structure, producing an increase
in combat power despite a decrease in the number of personnel. Smaller,
streamlined staffs with new billets for data scientists could replace
large organizations.

## \*\*Biotechnology\*\*

### Biotech = Military Applications

#### "Biotechnology," in the context of the topic, is exclusively [military applications]{.underline}

**Nicklin 1** Dr. Steve Nicklin, Senior Fellow at the Defence Science
and Technology Laboratory, Ministry of Defence, UK, PhD Immunology,
University of Bristol, "Medical Issues: The Future Impact of
Biotechnology on Human Factors," NATO Research and Technology

France, June 11-13, 2001, <https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA403342.pdf>
/GoGreen!

[**Biotechnology** within the military context can be defined as the
"the exploitation and manipulation of biological systems to benefit
overall military capability]{.underline}". Recent years have witnessed a
massive advance in scientific knowledge and capability mainly through
the advent of molecular biology and genetic engineering techniques.
These techniques have already led to considerable military benefits in
the form of new countermeasures to chemical and biological warfare
agents, novel sensors for the detection of explosives and equipment for
bioremediation and environmental clean-up. In the future it is envisaged
that advances in biotechnology will continue to provide advances
particularly in the field of autonomous sensing systems and new and
unique products and materials.

#### Best [functional limits]{.underline} -- it's a ripe controversy in NATO SC, with a variety of AFFs and coherent NEG ground

**Melson 3** Ashley R. Melson, JD, RPT, "Bioterrorism, Biodefense, and
Biotechnology in the Military: A Comparative Analysis of Legal and
Ethical Issues in the Research, Development, and Use of Biotechnological
Products on American and British Soldiers," 2003,
<https://law.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1117&context=expresso>
/GoGreen!

Also affected on a global scale and, perhaps, ever-so-evident with the
recent threats of bioterrorism, are the opportunities
**[biotechnology]{.underline}** presents [in the military
context]{.underline},**[20]{.underline}** which [is defined as "the
exploitation and manipulation of biological systems to benefit overall
military capability"**21**]{.underline}. [According to a recent
report]{.underline} by the Information Assurance Technology Analysis
Center (IATAC), ["history has shown that an infusion of technology can
provide a **significant military advantage** to the side that first
realizes its potential and exploits it."]{.underline}22
[However]{.underline}, the [historical examples]{.underline} described,
namely invention of the tank, development of U.S. naval aviation
capabilities, and technologies emerging from the Information Revolution,
[fail to invoke the **legal and ethical complexities** presented by
**biotechnological** **research**, **development**, and **use** in the
military]{.underline}. Such concerns become [**particularly relevant**
in light of the **history of abuse** of civilians and service member
subjects in research conducted or sponsored by the **militaries** of
both the **U.S.**]{.underline}23 [and its **European
Ally**]{.underline}, the United Kingdom (U.K.).24, 25

Although legal and ethical requirements for human subject research
technically do not exclude military entities, [statutory and judicial
"**loopholes**" have emerged in the **U.S.**,]{.underline}26 while the
U.K. has been slow to develop binding legal safeguards for non-military,
much less military, research subjects27. As recently demonstrated by the
joint U.S.-U.K. support for an invasion of Iraq,28 these two countries
are strong **[Allies]{.underline}**. Their [respective domestic laws and
policies]{.underline},29 [as well as international
treaties]{.underline},30 [call for collaboration in major military
matters ranging from scientific R&D to the interoperability of
forces]{.underline}.

[However, **collaboration** presents **controversy** in the context of
**biotechnology**]{.underline}. [Concerning biotech R&D, which
inherently involves techniques such as stem cell research]{.underline}31
[and somatic cell nuclear transfer]{.underline},32 [questions arise as
to how the U.S., with its limit of federal funding to only existing stem
cell lines]{.underline}33 [and potential for banning any funding of
therapeutic cloning]{.underline},34 [can effectively collaborate with
the U.K., which already funds these techniques]{.underline}35.
[Considering the extent of federal funding allotted to military
research]{.underline}36 [in light of the collaboration required by both
domestic and international instruments]{.underline},37 [compliance with
the proposed **U.S. restrictions** becomes, at best,
**illusory**]{.underline}.

[Moreover, **joint operability** of U.S. and U.K. forces presumably
requires the use of jointly operable equipment and supplies, including
**biotech** products]{.underline}. Even if these products go through
testing and development in the more "liberal" U.K., they would, in
practice, be used on both British and American soldiers38. Oftentimes,
military matters demand the use of any product that could provide even a
potential advantage over the adversary, regardless of whether the
product has been fully tested.39 Possible side effects of usage,
especially long-term, are of little consequence in the face of a present
and pressing enemy.40

[Beyond research, development, and use issues surrounding biotechnology
in the military are related and equally complex privacy issues invoked
by, for example, the collection and storage of DNA samples from
individual service members]{.underline}41. Although knowledge of each
soldiers' genetic make-up may be relevant, if not crucial, to present
mission success,42 [that]{.underline} same knowledge [could later prove
disastrous for the individual service member if revealed outside the
military context]{.underline}43. [Allied collaboration efforts further
hamper confidentiality by allowing not only a service member's own
country, but potentially many foreign nations, access to the most
detailed information, health-related and other, regarding individual
service members]{.underline}.

Despite the legal and ethical concerns raised, biotechnology has, and
will continue, to offer countless opportunities for enhancing military
capabilities. As such, the research, development and utilization of
biotech products are present realities in the U.S. and abroad, both
within and outside of the defense context. However, testing and usage,
as well as [effective collaboration between Allies, calls for the
resolution of complex and pressing issues presented by this intersection
of science, technology, and human lives. Resolutions must take into
account the history of abuses in military research, existing domestic
and international legal and ethical safeguards, and a special respect
for those serving to protect their country]{.underline}. In the present
global "war on terrorism,"44 the U.S. and its Allies should heed this
caution:

> The military enterprise is at once ethical and unethical. Ethical from
> "our" point of view because the nation is protected from aggressors,
> defended when attacked, determined to win at all costs. Unethical,
> especially as seen through the adversary's eyes, because anything
> goes. The victimization of noncombatants, misinformation and
> disinformation, clever feints, deception and other ploys of elaborate
> trickery, are the stock-in-trade of the "other" side. "We", of course,
> resort to the same (and often more) to preserve the power position,
> strategic balance, operational gain, or tactical advantage. Might

> Not only does anything go; everything goes. The 'un-morality' of war

> developing new and more effective weapons systems.45

The United States and South Korea should expand their **[security
cooperation in biotechnology]{.underline}** in the areas of global
health, gene synthesis, and medical and pharmaceutical research.

There is an opportunity to expand **[security cooperation]{.underline}**
between the United States and South Korea [on issues related to
**biotechnology**]{.underline}, to [**focus on** both **deliberate** and
**natural** **biological threats**]{.underline}. The United States and
South Korea have been demonstrated leaders in [taking on the challenges
of **disease threats**]{.underline}. They have participated [in
**biosecurity** **scenarios** (e.g., Able Response, a whole-of
government **exercise**)]{.underline}; both countries [contributed
resources and]{.underline} considerable [financial assistance to end the
Ebola epidemic]{.underline} in West Africa; [and]{.underline} they
[participate in the Global Health Security Agenda, which aims to reduce
global disease risks and supports]{.underline} the [International Health
Regulations]{.underline} (2005).

Boosting the security quotient of the Global Health Security Agenda.
Since its inception in 2014, the GHSA has incorporated a multilateral
and multisectoral approach towards [strengthening global **capacity**
and nations' abilities to **prevent**, **detect**, and adequately
**respond** to **infectious diseases**]{.underline}.33 The Ebola
epidemic demonstrated how a lack of adequate public health
infrastructure could lead to an international crisis, in spite of the
International Health Regulations (2005), which call for nations to
provide for adequate public health infrastructure. To date, the GHSA has
focused on self-assessments (called Joint External Evaluations, or JEE)
and there is an opportunity to focus donor country attention where it is
most needed.

An unusual aspect of the GHSA---for an initiative that is largely
focused on public health---is that from its inception it has included
the need to prepare for deliberate threats. Nonetheless, this aspect of
the GHSA has not moved forward as much as was initially hoped; while
some nations include their departments of defense in GHSA activities,
most do not, and in the JEE, biosafety and biosecurity are somewhat
mixed together. There is an opportunity for South Korea and the United
States to collaborate on efforts that encourage more countries to take a
more multisectoral approach [through a variety of means, such as holding
**mil**itary**-mil**itary **conferences**]{.underline} with other
nations from Southeast Asia **[or]{.underline}** developing a JEE
supplement **[with a military focus]{.underline}**.

Biosecurity implications of gene synthesis. In the field of
biotechnology, DNA synthesis is a valuable research tool for many
applications---from medicine to manufacturing---but as with many
powerful technologies, it is vulnerable to misuse. One common fear is
that DNA synthesis technologies could be used by nefarious actors to
procure the genetic material of a variety of pathogens from a commercial
supplier, or acquire the capability to do that themselves.34 Once
synthesized, the genetic material could be "booted up" like a computer
program, becoming actively infectious. "That many viruses can be made
from scratch has been demonstrated repeatedly, including in the
construction of poliovirus, 1918 influenza virus, and most recently, the
virus that causes horsepox," which is a close cousin to the smallpox
virus.35

Over the past decade, measures have been taken to reduce the likelihood
of misuse.36 Several gene-synthesis commercial suppliers formed the
International Gene Synthesis Consortium to develop protocols designed to
allow "individual companies to screen ordered sequences as well as to
verify customers."37 Not all international gene-synthesis companies are
members of an industry organization that agrees to either customer
screening or sequence screening. There are opportunities for the United
States and South Korea to encourage other nations to promote
industry-wide screening standards, champion a common code of conduct for
suppliers of DNA, and develop mechanisms so that more of the
gene-synthesis market performs screening, and has a place to report
suspicious orders. There is also the potential for research in this
area, as there is no publicly available data about how valuable the
sequence screening can be in stopping misuse, or whether screening could
be improved.38

Advanced development of pharmaceuticals and other medical
countermeasures. There is a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between
the US Department of Health and Human Services, US National Institutes
of Health, South Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare, and the Korea
National Institute of Health in which all parties "signed a letter of
intent (2015) to enhance biomedical research collaboration, personnel
exchange and training cooperation in fields of mutual interest."39 This
can be applied towards the development of vaccines and therapies for
biosecurity and health security concerns, from early research and
development stages through manufacturing.

For example, there could be joint research projects and funding streams
to study a virus that is of mutual concern to the United States and
South Korea. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a
respiratory virus that caused a serious outbreak in South Korea in 2015,
could be a suitable candidate. Under the MOU, multiple vaccine
candidates could be tested in a collaborative fashion, or research tools
to help advance MERS-CoV research could be developed and jointly shared
between the United States and South Korea.

## \*\*Cybersecurity\*\*

### Cybersec = Excludes Offense

#### "Cybersecurity" [excludes offensive operations]{.underline} 

**Sternstein 11** Aliya Sternstein, Senior Correspondent at Nextgov,
reports on cybersecurity and homeland security systems, has covered
technology for more than a decade at National Journal\'s Technology
Daily, Federal Computer Week and Forbes, formerly reported for
Congressional Quarterly, "Auditors: Pentagon Cyber Budget Has Fuzzy
Numbers," Nextgov, 8-2-2011,
<https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2011/08/auditors-pentagon-cyber-budget-has-fuzzy-numbers/54736/>
/GoGreen!

[Federal auditors have told Pentagon officials to **define
\"cybersecurity\"** so the military services adopt the same
terminology]{.underline}, and by extension, calculate their cyber
spending plans in comparable ways. With a clear definition, the
department could avoid having to redo the math on its cyber budget,
something it was forced to do twice this year.

The order follows the disclosure of fuzzy math in the Defense
Department\'s cyber budget. After Nextgov questioned why the Air
Force\'s \$4.6 billion 2012 budget request for cybersecurity was \$2.3
billion more than Defense\'s service-wide spending proposal, Pentagon
officials upped their total figure from \$2.3 billion to \$3.2 billion.

Eventually, [a Pentagon spokesperson explained that the service\'s
estimate differed dramatically because the Air Force included \"things\"
that are **not typically considered**]{.underline} information assurance
or **[cybersecurity]{.underline}**.

A Government Accountability Office letter to the House Armed Services
Committee on Friday reveals Defense officials provided Congress with a
rejiggered sum on yet another occasion.

\"During February and March 2011, [**DOD** provided Congress with
**three different views** of its **cybersecurity** budget
estimates]{.underline} for fiscal year 2012 (\$2.3 billion, \$2.8
billion, and \$3.2 billion, respectively) [that **included different
elements** of DOD\'s cybersecurity efforts]{.underline},\" wrote Davi M.
D\'Agostino, GAO director for Defense Capabilities and Management, and
Gregory C. Wilshusen, information technology director.

[The source of confusion seems to be **the department\'s** **narrow
view** of **cybersecurity**]{.underline}. GAO officials found that the
budget [**excludes offensive op**erational costs such as **computer
network exploitations**, or the infiltration of adversaries\' systems
for intelligence gathering and **computer network attacks**, which is
the disruption of enemy networks]{.underline}. In addition, the military
has no agreed-upon definitions for all cyber activities.

\"[In the absence of]{.underline} such [definitions, there are differing
perspectives on the elements that constitute cyberspace operations in
DOD]{.underline},\" the GAO officials wrote.

The Pentagon currently is unable to centrally round up information from
the services to calculate a single cyber budget estimate. \"[DOD has
operationally merged defensive and offensive cyberspace operations with
the creation of U.S. Cyber Command]{.underline} in October 2010, but the
department still does not have a designated focal point or methodology
for collecting and compiling budget information,\" the pair added.

In responding to draft findings, Defense officials said they would
define what activities are cyber operations and establish a means of
accounting for all such activities.

### Cybersec = Broad

Cybersecurity Defined

[The **official definition** of **cybersecurity** is, "Prevention of
damage to, protection of, and restoration of computers, electronic
communications systems, electronic communications services, wire
communication, and electronic communication, including information
contained therein, to ensure its availability, integrity,
authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation." -- **DoDI
8500.01**]{.underline}

Mission Prevent damage, protect, restore

Cyber Items Computers, electronic communications and services, wire
communications, electronic communication info

To Ensure Confidentiality, integrity, availability (non-repudiation and
authentication)

DoDI 5000.90 requires that program protection planning include
cybersecurity. It also identifies two cybersecurity activities, Assess
and Authorize, that are applicable within the Defense Acquisition
System. DoDI 8500.01, Cybersecurity, 14 Mar 2014, defines cybersecurity
and describes types of DoD IT. The DoD IT descriptions are used to
determine the scope and applicability of the two cybersecurity
activities identified by DoDI 5000.82, the Cybersecurity Strategy and
the Cybersecurity Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD Information
Technology (IT).

A Cybersecurity Strategy is required for all acquisitions of systems
containing IT and is included as an appendix to the Program Protection
Plan (PPP). The Cybersecurity RMF is required for all acquisitions
containing IT. DoDI 8510.01, Risk Management Framework (RMF) for DoD
Information Technology, details policies and procedures for implementing
the RMF for DoD IT.

Foundational Pillars of Cybersecurity

[Cybersecurity has five foundational pillars. The key triad is known as
"CIA" -- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability]{.underline}.

[Confidentiality]{.underline} [Information is not disclosed]{.underline}
to system entities (users, processes, devices) [unless]{.underline} they
have been [authorized]{.underline} to access the information.

[Integrity]{.underline} The property whereby an entity [has not been
modified]{.underline} in an unauthorized manner.

[Availability]{.underline} Being [accessible and usable upon
demand]{.underline} by an authorized entity.

Non-Repudiation Assurance that the sender of information is provided
with proof of delivery and the recipient is provided with proof of the
sender\'s identity, so neither can later deny having processed the
information.

Authentication Verifying the identity or other attributes claimed by or
assumed of an entity (user, process, or device), or to verify the source
and integrity of data.

#### That [does NOT limit the means]{.underline} employed -- includes [physical protection]{.underline}, civilian [stakeholder engagement]{.underline} AND [offensive operations]{.underline}

In order to effectively apply national cybersecurity defense measures
against these cyberspace attacks, [the term
**cybersecurity**]{.underline} defense [must be **clearly
defined**]{.underline}. For example, at each level of government --
political, strategic, operational, and tactical, differing points of
view exist regarding strategic level cybersecurity defense.5 These
varying perspectives influence how cybersecurity defense is defined and
how national cybersecurity strategy is interpreted and implemented.
Moreover, [the terms national **cybersecurity** and **cybersecurity
defense** are **used synonymously** in U.S. policy discussions, which
further complicates classifying cybersecurity defense]{.underline}.
[This is an important distinction because **different definitions of
cybersecurity have significant implications** on the **actions** or
operations of cybersecurity defense **agencies** and **impacts** the
cybersecurity defense roles adopted by various levels of government
during national policy and strategy formulation]{.underline}.

[Analyses of twenty different cybersecurity strategies in]{.underline}
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (**[NATO]{.underline}**)
[National Cyber Security Framework Manual]{.underline}6 [reveal that
**diverging variations** of **cybersecurity** defense **definitions**
are **common**]{.underline}. [This manual advocates]{.underline} that
government organizations differentiate their cybersecurity defenses
activities based upon national cybersecurity perspective, unique network
capabilities, and or Federal agency partnerships.7 For example, several
cybersecurity strategies contained in this manual8 propose [the
integration of multi-dimensional cyber security efforts in which
government, society, and influential stakeholders work together in
cooperation to provide adequate levels of cybersecurity]{.underline}
defense.9 Exacerbating this situation, many of the cybersecurity defense
processes developed to support cybersecurity definitions hinder generic
government collaboration internally. [However, **to what end** is
**not** so **clearly identified** and **different cybersecurity
strategies** are based **uniquely** upon **different cybersecurity
definitions**]{.underline}. Within the complex conceptual framework of
cybersecurity defense, [the **U**nited **S**tates has established the
following three definitions **used interchangeably**]{.underline}
throughout the cybersecurity defense strategy formulation process.

[One]{.underline} cybersecurity defense paradigm [embraced by the U.S.
Department of Defense]{.underline} (**[DOD]{.underline}**) [is
characterized as **organizational actions required to ensure "security
of information in all its forms** -- electronic and physical, **and the
security of the systems and networks** where information is stored,
accessed, processed, and transmitted, **including precautions taken to
guard against crime, attack, sabotage, espionage, accidents and
failures**."]{.underline}10 **[This definition]{.underline}** is
especially useful for DoD operations, as it [**does not limit** the
departments' **actions** in mitigating potential cyber
threats]{.underline}. [Another]{.underline} cybersecurity defense
classification [is utilized by the U.S. military services and integrates
a Joint Operations point of view. This definition]{.underline} advocates
the use of Computer Network Defense (CND) actions to [include
"**protecting, monitoring, analyzing, detecting, and responding to
unauthorized activity within** Department of Defense (**DoD**)
**information systems and computer networks**]{.underline}."11
[**Again** the premise behind this classification is **freedom to
maneuver** regarding cybersecurity defensive actions]{.underline}.
[Lastly, U.S. Cyber Command (US**CYBERCOM**) uses a strictly operational
taxonomy to describe **cybersecurity**]{.underline} defensive operations
-- ["direct and synchronized actions to detect, analyze, counter and
mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities; to out maneuver adversaries
taking or about to take offensive actions; and to otherwise protect
critical missions that enable US freedom of action in
cyberspace."]{.underline}12 While all of the actions contained in these
definitions are fundamental to the successful defense of critical
national and federal network systems, t[he USCYBERCOM
explanation]{.underline} is the most directive in [implying a position
of **offensive action**]{.underline}.

**Updegrave 91** (W.C., "Explanation of ZIP Code Address Purpose", 8-19,
<http://www.supremelaw.org/ref/zipcode/updegrav.htm>)

More specifically, looking at the map on page 11 of the National ZIP
Code Directory, e.g. at a local post office, one will see that the first
digit of a ZIP Code defines an area that includes more than one State.
The first sentence of the explanatory paragraph begins: \"A ZIP Code is
a numerical code that identifies areas within the United States and its
territories for purposes of \...\" \[cf. 26 CFR 1.1-1(c)\]. [Note the
**singular possessive** pronoun \"its\", not \"their\", therefore
carrying the implication that it relates to the **\"United
States\"**]{.underline} [as a corporation domiciled in the **D**istrict
of **C**olumbia (in the singular sense), not in the sense of being the
50 States of the Union (in the plural sense).]{.underline} The map shows
all the States of the Union, but it also shows D.C., Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands, making the explanatory statement literally correct.

600; 44 Oil & Gas Rep. 214, Lexis)

On its face, the written instrument granting easement rights in this
case is ambiguous. The same sentence which refers to the right to lay a
14 inch pipeline (singular) has a later reference to \"said lines\"
(plural). The use of the plural \"lines\" makes no sense because the
only previous reference has been to a \"line\" (singular). [The writing
is]{.underline} additionally [ambiguous because]{.underline} other key
words which are \"also may change the size of its pipes\" are dangling
in that [the possessive pronoun \"its\"]{.underline} before the word
\"pipes\" [does not have any subject preceding, to which the possessive
pronoun refers]{.underline}. The dangling phrase is the beginning of a
sentence, the first word of which does not begin with a capital letter
as is customary in normal English \[\*\*\*10\]  usage. Immediately
preceding the \"sentence\" which does not begin with a capital letter,
there appears a dangling  \[\*236\]  semicolon which makes no sense at
the beginning of a sentence and can hardly relate to the preceding
sentence which is already properly punctuated by a closing period. [The
above deviations from accepted grammatical usage **make difficult, if
not impossible, a clear understanding** of the words used or the
intention of the parties]{.underline}. This is particularly true
concerning the meaning of a disputed phrase in the instrument which
states that the grantee is to pay damages from \". . . the relaying,
maintaining and operating said pipeline. . . .\" The instrument is
ambiguous as to what the words \". . . relaying . . . said pipeline . .
.\" were intended to mean.

#### It's a term of exclusion

**Frey 28** (Judge -- Supreme Court of Missouri, Supreme Court of
Missouri,

320 Mo. 1058; 10 S.W.2d 47; 1928 Mo. LEXIS 834, Lexis)

In support of this contention appellant again argues that when any
ambiguity exists in a will it is the duty of the court to construe the
will under guidance of the presumption that the testatrix intended her
property to go to her next of kin, unless there is a strong intention to
the contrary. Again we say, there is intrinsic proof of a  \[\*1074\] 
strong intention to the contrary. In the first place, testatrix only
named two of her blood relatives in the will and had she
desired \[\*\*\*37\]  them to take the residuary estate she doubtless
would have mentioned them by name in the residuary clause. In the second
place, if she used the word \"heirs\" in the sense of blood relatives
she certainly would have dispelled all ambiguity by stating whose blood
relatives were intended. Not only had  \[\*\*53\]  she taken pains in
the will to identify her own two blood relatives but she had also
identified certain blood relatives of her deceased husband. [Had it been
her intention to vest the residuary estate in her blood relatives
**solely**, she would certainly have used the **possessive pronoun**
\"my\" instead of the indefinite article \"the\"]{.underline} in the
clause, \"the above heirs.\"its is geographical.

#### It's exclusive

**Brent 10** (Douglas F. Brent, attorney, "Reply Brief on Threshold
Issues of Cricket Communications, Inc.," 6-2-2010,
<http://psc.ky.gov/PSCSCF/2010%20cases/2010-00131/20100602_Crickets_Reply_Brief_on_Threshold_Issues.pdf>)

AT&T also argues that Merger Commitment 7.4 only permits extension of
"any given" interconnection agreement for a single three year term. AT&T
Brief at 12. Specifically, AT&T asserts that because Cricket adopted the
interconnection agreement between Sprint and AT&T, which itself was
extended, Cricket is precluded from extending the term of its agreement
with AT&T. Id This argument relies upon an inaccurate assumption: that
the agreement (contract) between Sprint and AT&T, and the agreement
(contract) between Cricket and AT&T, are one and the same. In other
words, to accept AT&T's argument the Commission must conclude that two
separate contracts, i.e. the interconnection between Sprint and AT&T in
Kentucky ("Sprint Kentucky Agreement") and the interconnection between
Cricket and AT&T in Kentucky ("Cricket Kentucky Agreement"), are one and
the same. Upon this unstated (and inaccurate) premise AT&T asserts that
"the ICA was already extended"; id. at 14, and "the ICA Cricket seeks to
extend was extended by Sprint . . . ."; id. at 15, and, finally,
"Cricket cannot extend the same ICA a second time . . . ." Id. (emphasis
added in all). Note that in the quoted portions of the AT&T brief (and
elsewhere) [AT&T uses vague and imprecise language]{.underline} when
referring to either the Sprint Kentucky Agreement, or the Cricket
Kentucky Agreement, [in hopes that the Commission will treat the two
contracts as one and the same]{.underline}. But it would be a mistake to
do so. The contract governing AT&T's duties and obligations with Sprint
is a legally distinct and separate contract from that which governs
AT&T's duties with Cricket. The Sprint Kentucky Agreement was approved
by the Commission in September of 2001 in Case Number 2000-00480. The
Cricket Kentucky Agreement was approved by the Commission in September
of 2008 in Case Number 2008-033 1. [AT&T ignores the fact that these are
two separate and distinct contracts because it knows that the merger
commitments apply to each agreement]{.underline} that an individual
telecommunications carrier has with AT&T. Notably, Merger Commitment 7.4
states that "AT&T/BellSouth ILECs shall permit a requesting
telecommunications carrier to extend its current interconnection
agreement . . . . As written, [the commitment allows any carrier to
extend "its" agreement]{.underline}. Clearly, [the use of the pronoun
"**its**" in this context is **possessive**, such that the term "its"
means - that particular carrier's agreement]{.underline} with AT&T ([and
**not any other** carrier's agreement]{.underline}). Thus, the merger
commitment applies to each agreement that an individual carrier may have
with AT&T. It necessarily follows then, that Cricket's right to extend
its agreement under Merger Commitment 7.4 is separate and distinct right
from another carrier's right to extend its agreement with AT&T (or
whether such agreement has been extended).

### Substantial Protection = 50% From Baseline

#### Substantial increase in protection must be at least 50% increase in baseline coverage

Given the estimation model, these coefficients can be interpreted as
elasticities. For the employment outcome, this means that [a 1% increase
in the percentage of protected land]{.underline} in a town or city [was
associated with an approximate 0.03% increase in the number of people
employed]{.underline}. For example, for a town with 20,000 people
employed, **[a substantial increase in protection]{.underline}**, [from
10% protected to **15% protected**]{.underline} (**[or a 50%
increase]{.underline}**), would lead to an approximately 1.5% increase
(0.03 × 50) in people employed or 300 additional people employed. By
comparison, the peak-to-trough changes in employment for the economic
expansion from 2003 to 2008 and recession from 2008 to 2010 were \>6%

(1990). Although the tax court has held that [the definition of

**Maples 7** (Larry, "Pitfalls in Preserving Net Operating Losses", The

If a new loss corporation has substantial nonbusiness assets, the value
of the old loss corporation must be reduced by the amount of the
nonbusiness assets less liabilities attributable to those assets.
[\"Substantial\" is defined as one-third of total assets.]{.underline}
This is a difficult provision to interpret. IRC section 382(1)(4)
provides that a value reduction in the old loss corporation is required
if, just after an ownership change, the new loss corporation has
substantial nonbusiness assets. This language seems odd because the
purpose of IRC section 382 is to prevent loss trafficking, so it would
seem that the asset test ought to apply to the old loss corporation.

**[Substantial = 40%]{.underline}**

Iowa Law Review, January, 79 Iowa L. Rev. 273, Lexis)

n241 I am assuming here that \"foreseeable\" means \"probable,\" as in
\"more probable than not.\" This appears to be a safe assumption given
the proliferance of cases granting immunity to officials who offend the
Constitution. If this definition is correct, deterrence only works and
liability should only attach if one\'s conduct, viewed ex ante, is more
likely illegal than legal: the risk of illegality must be more than
fifty percent. In other words, one cannot face deterrence, and liability
will not attach, if the risk of illegality is less than fifty percent[.
(When viewed in this fashion, one might perceive a risk]{.underline} of
illegality but still not be deterrable because the risk [is **not
substantial, i.e., not greater than fifty percent**.).]{.underline}
Lawful conduct, of course, need not be probably lawful. That is what
risk is about. Situations might arise where the objective risk is that
conduct is unlawful, but ex post it is lawful. Lest judicial reasoning
be completely askew, a fairly strong correlation exists, however,
between action that is ex ante probably lawful and that which is lawful
ex post in the courts. If this is not true, then courts are reaching
objectively improbable conclusions, and the whole idea of reliance is
illusory.

The URAA and the SAA neither amend nor refine the language of
§ 1677(4)(C).  In fact, they merely suggest, without disqualifying other
alternatives, a "clearly higher/substantial proportion" approach. 
Indeed, the SAA specifically mentions that no "precise mathematical
formula" or "'benchmark' proportion" is to be used for a dumping
concentration analysis.  SAA at 860 (citations omitted); see also Venez.
Cement, 279 F. Supp. 2d at 1329-30.  Furthermore, as the Court of
International Trade noted, the SAA emphasizes that the Commission
retains the discretion to determine concentration of imports on a
"case-by-case basis."  SAA at 860.  Finally, [the definition of the word
"substantial" undercuts the]{.underline} CFTVC's [argument.  The word
"substantial" generally means "considerable in amount,]{.underline}
value or worth."  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280
(1993).  [**It does not imply a specific number or cut-off**.  What may
be substantial in one situation may not be in another
situation.]{.underline}  The very breadth of the term "substantial"
undercuts the CFTVC's argument that Congress spoke clearly in
establishing a standard for the Commission's regional antidumping and
countervailing duty analyses.  It therefore supports the conclusion that
the Commission is owed deference in its interpretation of "substantial
proportion."  The Commission clearly embarked on its analysis having
been given considerable leeway to interpret a particularly broad term.

The question then becomes whether the intended construction would
violate the restrictive covenant by \"substantially\" blocking the view
of the lake from plaintiffs\' home. The term \"[substantial\" is

[as]{.underline}: \"being of moment: important, essential\";
\"considerable in amount . . .\"; \"being that specified to a large

As said in 83 C.J.S. Substantial, page 762:

The word \"substantial\" is a relative, and not an exact, term. It has

blood **[levels]{.underline}** for omeprazole.\" 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS

[**By contrast** here]{.underline}, the claim language provides a point
of reference regarding what the term \"increase\" means by noting that
the level of active C1 esterase in the blood must \"increase\" to \"at

### Increase = Pre-existing

#### "Increase" means to make greater and requires pre-existence

**Buckley 6** (Jeremiah, Attorney, Amicus Curiae Brief, Safeco Ins. Co.
of America et al v. Charles Burr et al,
<http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/briefs/06-84/06-84.mer.ami.mica.pdf>)

First, the court said that the ordinary meaning of the word "increase"
is "to make something greater," which it believed should not "be limited
to cases in which a company raises the rate that an individual has
previously been charged." 435 F.3d at 1091. Yet the definition offered
by the Ninth Circuit compels the opposite conclusion. [Because
"increase" means "to **make something greater**," there must necessarily
have been an **existing** premium]{.underline}, to which Edo's actual
premium may be compared, [to determine whether an "increase"
occurred]{.underline}. Congress could have provided that "ad-verse
action" in the insurance context means charging an amount greater than
the optimal premium, but instead chose to define adverse action in terms
of an "increase." That def-initional choice must be respected, not
ignored. See Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392-93 n.10 (1979)
("\[a\] defin-ition which declares what a term 'means' . . . excludes
any meaning that is not stated"). Next, the Ninth Circuit reasoned that
because the Insurance Prong includes the words "existing or applied
for," Congress intended that an "increase in any charge" for insurance
must "apply to all insurance transactions -- from an initial policy of
insurance to a renewal of a long-held policy." 435 F.3d at 1091. This
interpretation reads the words "exist-ing or applied for" in isolation.
Other types of adverse action described in the Insurance Prong apply
only to situations where a consumer had an existing policy of insurance,
such as a "cancellation," "reduction," or "change" in insurance. Each of
these forms of adverse action presupposes an already-existing policy,
and [under **usual canons of statutory construction** the term
"increase]{.underline}" also [should be construed to apply to increases
of an **already-existing** policy]{.underline}. See Hibbs v. Winn, 542
U.S. 88, 101 (2004) ("a phrase gathers meaning from the words around
it") (citation omitted).

#### Plan creates [new types]{.underline} of restrictions \-\-- voting issue:

### Increase Excludes Creation Ext

#### "Increase" requires pre-existence

**Brown 3** -- US Federal Judge -- District Court of Oregon (Elena Mark
and Paul Gustafson, Plaintiffs, v. Valley Insurance Company and Valley
Property and Casualty, Defendants, 7-17, Lexis)

FCRA does not define the term \"increase.\" [The]{.underline} plain and
[ordinary meaning of the verb \"to increase\" is to make something
greater]{.underline} or larger. 4 Merriam-Webster\'s \[\*\*22\]
Collegiate Dictionary 589 (10th ed. 1998). The \"something\" that is
increased in the statute is the \"charge for any insurance.\" The plain
and common meaning of the noun \"charge\" is \"the price demanded for
something.\" Id. at 192. Thus, the statute plainly means an insurer
takes adverse action if the insurer makes greater (i.e., larger) the
price demanded for insurance.

[An insurer cannot \"make greater\" something that did not exist
previously]{.underline}. The statutory definition of adverse action,
therefore, clearly anticipates an insurer must have made an initial
charge or demand for payment before the insurer can increase that
charge. In other words, an insurer cannot increase the charge for
insurance unless the insurer previously set and demanded payment of the
premium for that insured\'s insurance \[\*\*23\] coverage at a lower
price.

#### Accurate application of statutory canons is the [biggest impact]{.underline} \-\-- it's the only way to determine the [purpose]{.underline} and [intent]{.underline} of writing

**Sentell 91** (R. Perry Jr., Talmadge Professor of Law -- University of
Georgia and LLM -- Harvard University, "The Canons of Construction in
Georgia: \"Anachronisms\" in Action", Georgia Law Review, Winter, 25 Ga.
L. Rev. 365, Lexis)

CONCLUSION\
Because the consideration of written communication is the cornerstone of
the judicial process, the technique involved in that consideration has
intrigued the ages. That technique, [judicial
interpretation]{.underline}, \[\*434\]  attempts a highly delicate
balance. On the one hand, it [acknowledges the]{.underline} legendary
[imprecision of language. On the other hand, it seeks to glean from that
language the elusive signals of purpose, meaning and intent. A
\"science\" so inexact]{.underline} incessantly [craves]{.underline} a
semblance of [constants \-- conventions assisting to **impose order**
upon understanding]{.underline}.\
Roman law, and subsequently the English common-law system, sought to
appease this insatiable desire by offering up the canons of
construction. [The canons, **fundamental maxims of**]{.underline}
compositional [**meaning**, have proved]{.underline} both vulnerable and
[venerable]{.underline}. Their existence has provided an irresistible
historic target for a labyrinth of denigrating commentary. Yet [the
courts]{.underline}, the construers themselves, [have
claimed]{.underline} the [canons]{.underline} as their own, affording
them [a **determinative role** in]{.underline} judicial
[decisionmaking]{.underline} which transverses the spectrum of
litigation. Accordingly, the [critics are left with little choice but to
concede the canons\']{.underline} existence and [shaping
influence]{.underline}, while pleading for caution in their invocation.\
From the canonical mass, the most popular and powerful maxims of meaning
are perhaps the three here selected for treatment: Noscitur a sociis,
Ejusdem generis and Expressio unius est exclusio alterius. Although
different, the three precepts are also similar \-- they counsel an
analysis of associating what is present with what is to be determined.
[The writer]{.underline}, they presume, [meant something by what he
expressed; that expression]{.underline}, or at least a portion of it,
they insist, [offers the **best hope** for resolving]{.underline} the
[ambiguity]{.underline} at hand. As they occasionally broaden,
frequently constrict and sometimes exclude, the maxims operate to propel
the interpreter toward an intent, meaning or purpose that will decide
the controversy.

\"increase\" is [used in relation to considerations to be taken into
account in the exercise of a function, rather than an objective in

**Resolved**

**[Resolved = Certain]{.underline}**

**Resolved requires certainty**

**Dafoe 12** \-\-- Allan Dafoe A dissertation submitted in partial
satisfaction of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
in Political Science in the Graduate Division of the University of
California, Berkeley, "Resolve, Reputation, and War: Cultures of Honor

(BJN)

Furthermore, based on my reading of historical crises, I believe that
concern for reputation is a substantively critical determinant of
resolve, and perhaps the most interesting component, analytically and
for policy. To see this, it is helpful to look at how the term resolve,
and synonyms, are actually used. The [Oxford]{.underline} English
Dictionary5 [defines resolve as]{.underline} follows (I only list the
more common usages): 1.a. The fact of having resolved upon a course of
action, stance, etc.; a firm intention. Also in pl. in same sense (now
somewhat arch.). 1.b. An act of resolving to do something; a resolution.
2. [Firmness or steadfastness of purpose]{.underline}; determination; an
instance of this\... And OED defines "resolved" as (I only list usages
related to human behavior): 1.a. Of the mind, etc.: **[freed from doubt
or uncertainty]{.underline}**; settled. Obs. 1.b. Of a person:
convinced, satisfied, or certain of something. Obs. 1.c. Of doctrine:
adopted or accepted after careful deliberation. Obs. 2.a. Of a person:
that has resolved to do something; having fixed intention; determined,
decided. 2.b. Of an action, state of mind, etc.: fully determined upon,
deliberate. 2.c. Of a person: staunch, dedicated; committed, confirmed;
that is thoroughly committed to the specified or implied course of
action, practice, religious belief, doctrine, etc. 3. Of a person, the
mind, etc.: characterized by determination or firmness of purpose;
resolute. 4. That has been decided or resolved on or upon. As is clear
from these definitions, the term resolve is often understood as
referring to the result of a process of deliberation, decision, and
commitment. One resolves to do something. In this sense, [resolve
is]{.underline} not simply a byproduct of a weighing of the pros and
cons of escalating, but is instead [a decision that one makes and then
**commits to.**]{.underline} When Pericles sought to persuade the
Athenians to reject the Spartan ultimatum, he argued that the decision
over whether to make even a trivial concession under coercion was a
"test of your resolution" (The Peloponnesian War , p. 1.140.5; under
Warner translation, "proof of your determination"). It was common
knowledge that the final Spartan demand---rescinding of a minor piece of
economic statecraft known as the Megarian Decree---was extremely modest
and of little material consequence to the Athenians. Pericles and other
Athenians were not concerned that they would get a reputation for having
a particular set of interests, such as not caring about the Megarian
Decree. It is, after all, largely futile for a democracy, such as
Classical Athens, to try to build a reputation for having certain
interests since the preferences of various groups are readily observed
through their democratic process of public deliberation. As Pericles
pointed out, what was at stake was Athens' reputation for committing to
its position, which in this case was the principle that Athens and
Sparta should treat each other as equals and overcome disputes through
arbitration. A reputation for resolve is not a reputation for wanting to
fight over many issues, but a reputation for being willing to fight for
those issues that one commits to.

**"resolved" is a motion - doesn't denote certainty or immediacy in this
context**

General Henry M. **Robert**, Chief Engineer of the Army, "Robert's Rules
of Order Revised", 19**51**, Page 34

[**A motion** is a proposal that the assembly take certain action,
or]{.underline} that [it]{.underline} express itself as
[hold]{.underline}ing [certain views. It is]{.underline} made by a
member's obtaining the floor as already described and saying, "I move
that" (which is [equivalent to]{.underline} [saying, **"I propose
that"),**]{.underline} and [then stating the action]{.underline} he
proposes to have taken. Thus a member "[moves]{.underline}" (proposes)
[that a resolution be adopted, **or amended**]{.underline}, [or referred
to a committee]{.underline}, or **[that a vote of]{.underline}** thanks
be **[extended]{.underline}**, etc.; or "That it is the sense of this
meeting (or assembly) that industrial training," etc. Every resolution
should be in writing, and the presiding officer has a right to require
any main motion, amendment, or instructions to a committee to be in
writing. [When a main motion is of such importance]{.underline} or
length as to be in writing [it is usually written in the form of a
**resolution**; that is, beginning with the words,]{.underline}
"**[Resolved]{.underline}**, That," the word "Resolved" being
underscored (printed in italics) and followed by a comma, and the word
"That" beginning with a capital "T." If the word "Resolved" were
replaced by the words "I move," the resolution would become a motion. A
resolution is always a main motion. In some sections of the country the
word "resolve" is frequently used instead of "resolution." In assemblies
with paid employees, instructions given to employees are called "orders"
instead of "resolutions," and the enacting word, "Ordered" is used
instead of "Resolved."

\"*Should*\" not only is used as a \"present indicative\" synonymous
with *ought* but also is the past tense of \"shall\" with various shades
of meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments
§ 121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
(1984); St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075,
1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge
quotation infra note 15. [Certain contexts mandate a construction of the
term \"should\" as **more** than merely indicating]{.underline}
preference or [desirability]{.underline}. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury
instructions stating that jurors \"should\" reduce the amount of damages
in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff
was held to imply an *obligation* *and to be more than advisory*);

(1990) (one of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring that a party
\"should devote a section of the brief to the request for the fee or
expenses\" was interpreted to mean that a party is under an *obligation*
to include the requested segment); State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215
(Mo. 1958) [(\"should\" would mean the same as]{.underline} \"shall\" or
[\"must\"]{.underline} when used in an instruction to the jury which
tells the triers they \"should disregard false testimony\").

**[Should is Mandatory]{.underline}**

**"Should" is mandatory**

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009
People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,
215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the
Arizona Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s
or commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty**
or **obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

**"Should" means must -- its mandatory**

**Foresi 32** (Remo Foresi v. Hudson Coal Co., Superior Court of
Pennsylvania, 106 Pa. Super. 307; 161 A. 910; 1932 Pa. Super. LEXIS 239,
7-14, Lexis)

[As regards the mandatory character of the rule, the word
\'should\']{.underline} is not only an auxiliary verb, it
[is]{.underline} also [the preterite of the verb, \'shall\' and has for
one of its meanings as]{.underline} defined in the Century Dictionary:
\"[Obliged or compelled (to); would have (to); **must**; ought (to);
used with an infinitive]{.underline} (without to) [to express
obligation, necessity or duty in connection with some act yet to be
carried out.\"]{.underline} We think it clear that it is in that sense
that the word \'should\' is used in this rule, not merely advisory. When
the judge in charging the jury tells them that, unless they find from
all the evidence, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant is
guilty of the offense charged, they should acquit[, the word \'should\'
**is not used in an advisory sense** but has the force or meaning of
\'must\', or \'ought to\' and carries]{.underline} \[\*\*\*8\] [with it
the sense of]{.underline} \[\*313\] [obligation and duty equivalent to
**compulsion**]{.underline}. A natural sense of sympathy for a few
unfortunate claimants who have been injured while doing something in
direct violation of law must not be so indulged as to fritter away, or
nullify, provisions which have been enacted to safeguard and protect the
welfare of thousands who are engaged in the hazardous occupation of
mining.

Other legislated DA earmarks in the FY2005 appropriations bill are
smaller and more targeted: plant biotechnology research and development
(\$25 million), the American Schools and Hospitals Abroad program (\$20
million), women's leadership capacity (\$15 million), the International
Fertilizer Development Center (\$2.3 million), and clean water treatment
(\$2 million). Interestingly, in the wording of the bill, Congress uses
the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.
[The **difference** between *shall* and *should* may have **legal
significance**---one is clearly **mandatory** while the other is a
**strong admonition**---but it makes little practical
difference]{.underline} in USAID's need to comply with the congressional
directive to the best of its ability.

[should]{.underline}    /ʃʊd/ Show Spelled\[shood\] Show IPA --auxiliary
verb 1. pt. of shall. 2. ([used to express condition]{.underline}): Were
he to arrive, I should be pleased. 3. must; ought (used to indicate
duty, propriety, or expediency): You should not do that. 4. would (used
to make a statement less direct or blunt): I should think you would
apologize. Use should in a Sentence See images of should Search should

confused:  could, should, would (see usage note at this entry ).
---Synonyms 3. See must1 . ---[Usage note]{.underline} Rules similar to
those for choosing between shall and will have long been advanced for
should and would, but again the rules have had little effect on usage.
In most constructions, would is the auxiliary chosen regardless of the
person of the subject: If our allies would support the move, we would
abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised at the
complexity of the directions. Because the main function of should in
modern American English is to express duty, necessity, etc. ( You should
get your flu shot before winter comes ), its use for other purposes, as
to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I
should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an
affectation to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite
common in British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would
) have called immediately. I should (American would ) really prefer a
different arrangement. As with shall and will, most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbook rule in making a
choice between should and would. [See also shall.]{.underline} Shall
