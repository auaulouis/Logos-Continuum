# Emerging Tech Innovation Aff

## Notes

### Explanation

#### This is an affirmative case that proposes increased U.S. security cooperation with NATO over emerging technology innovation. The plan proposes that the U.S. strengthen NATO's defense innovation hubs and research and development in AI, biotech, and cybersecurity. Specifically, it calls for the U.S. to increase its support of and participation in NATO's Innovation Fund and Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA). 

#### There are two advantages: RMA (Revolution in Military Affairs) and Alliance Fragmentation. The RMA advantage claims that the plan is necessary to maintain NATO's military superiority over its adversaries. This is critical to prevent great power war, deter Russia, and de-escalate global hotspots. 

#### The Alliance Fragmentation advantage claims that U.S. support for the NIF and DIANA is crucial to integrate the various allied defense innovation ecosystems. This is crucial to effectively counterbalance China because it unites the U.S.'s European and Asia-Pacific allies and bolsters their military capabilities.

#### This case has strong "U.S. key," "NATO key," and "U.S. security cooperation key" advantages. NATO is already moving ahead with its NIF and DIANA, but U.S. support has so far been only pro forma and perfunctory. The affirmative can therefore argue that the status quo links to generic "NATO Bad" and "NIF/DIANA Bad" DAs, but that the plan is crucial to solve the advantages.

Introduction

[[NATO and the West are experiencing a **reversed**]{.mark} **kind
of**]{.underline} revolution in military affairs
(**[[RMA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [with new tech]{.underline}nologies
[bearing far-reaching implications beyond the conduct of war. Past
revolutions in military spilled from the battlefield to the civilian
sector.]{.underline} They had an effect either by directly impacting the
result of a given conflict or through adoption of military technical
advantages in non-military aspects of life. [Today]{.underline}, [we see
an opposite trend brought by the private and non-military]{.underline},
[non-governmental actors. In their everyday lives, general publics and
governments alike face military-grade tech]{.underline}nologies
[developed and applied by the commercial sector. And it is the private
sector that enjoys exclusivity over these tech]{.underline}nologies
[while the military lags behind.]{.underline}

How information is gathered, processed, analysed, communicated,
distributed, and utilized has always underlined military planning and
assumptions for success in conflict. For example, the reconnaissance
strike complex introduced by the Soviets was based on real-time
intelligence gathering and underpinned by automated systems and fast
data processing. Similarly, NATO's deep attack concept assumed that
commanders "would be given the automated assessment means necessary to
rapidly analyse the enemy's force array."\[1\] Such concepts, however
innovative and tech-based, assumed a relatively limited amount of data
and relied heavily on the human factor. Today, in the era of cloud
computing and artificial intelligence, there is a clear shift towards
sensor-centric, automated processing. Reconnaissance and analysis are
becoming as important as firepower and kinetic effects. Humans are being
pushed out from the decision-making due to the quantity of information
gathered/coming from the battlefield. The hyper-speed warfare (or the
"hyper war," a term linking the intensity of conflict with cybernetics)
risks making the human factor almost obsolete. To a certain extent,
human presence in the loop will consequently become more a question of
morality and less of efficacy.

[None of this is science fiction]{.underline}, [as modern
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[enabling hyper war **already
exist**. The question]{.mark} for NATO and the West [is not
**whether**]{.mark} they choose [to adopt]{.mark} these
tech]{.underline}nologies [[but **how**]{.mark} they should adopt them
to their benefit.]{.underline}

The situation is even more complicated if we consider the myriad of
actors involved in international security. In the past, timing and
accuracy of decision-making depended on a system designed by the state,
was utilized on the state level, and made for the state's purpose.
Today, external entities such as corporations, non-state actors, groups
of citizens and individuals matter as well. They hold the power and the
technological means to exercise significant pressure over state affairs.
Some even have the ability to largely cripple the functioning of
governments and state services.

[[This]{.mark} development [poses a **significant challenge**]{.mark} to
NATO's ability to deliver on its core tasks. If the Alliance wants to
successfully continue its political-military adaptation, it will need a
new approach to decision-making, operational planning, and crisis
management.]{.underline}

This article addresses some of the key issues the Alliance needs to
consider as it navigates through the new kind of revolution in military
affairs: 1) the changing character of warfare; 2) the domination of the
private sector over the military in the deployment of commercial
technology with military potential; 3) and the interdependence of
decision-making and modern technology.

The Changed Nature of Warfare

[Modern tech]{.underline}nologies [are **changing the nature of
warfare**]{.underline}, [as they have throughout the human
history.]{.underline} In many instances, introduction of new weaponry
constituted for a tactical advantage on the battlefield, occasionally
reaching a strategic-level impact. An example of that can be the
introduction of the British longbow at the Battle of Agincourt. Other
technologies changed profoundly how militaries operate and wage war.
Among such examples are railroads, telegraph, radar, combustion engine,
jet engine, or radio frequencies-based communication equipment. The
revolutionary nature of these technologies usually brings about
significant changes in defence planning, command and control, and force
organization.

[For]{.underline} any institution, be it a nation state, a large
bureaucracy, or an international alliance such as [NATO, the ability to
adopt disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [is key.]{.underline} The
adoption usually leads to a larger structural adaptation: The use of
standardized calibres in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
allowed for greater flexibility and uniformity of the French forces. The
first use of Marconi's wireless telegraphy by the British armed forces
in the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) changed the way how military
communicated. The use of railroads in the 19th century wars had a
strategic effect on the mobility and supply of forces. Finally, the
deployment of radar technology during World War 2 improved both
defensive and offensive capacities of the militaries, and, as a result,
probably saved thousands of lives. In all these instances, the military
advancement of technologies spilled over to the civilian side as well.

In the past five decades, military science theorists have been dealing
with the evolution in warfare in more detail. Although the main focus
was dedicated to the then-ongoing Cold War, scholars from the field made
a number of predictions that have proven to be correct. They correctly
understood that technological advancement was gaining momentum and that
the upcoming changes were not going be evolutionary but would come in
leaps.\[2\]

Three concepts also emerged from this thinking: military technical
revolution (MTR), revolution in military affairs (RMA), and military
revolution (MR). Even though they stand individually, all three concepts
are closely interconnected. For example, technology or a weapon platform
that has reached the level of military technical revolution can, in the
end, reach the level of military revolution as long as it constitutes
considerable changes to organizational structure and operational art. In
several cases, the MTR, RMA and MR are seen as one concept
altogether.\[3\]

Military Technical Revolution, Revolution in Military Affairs, and
Military Revolution

An event has to meet several conditions to qualify as a MTR/RMA/MR. A
revolution is defined by a profound change in military systems,
operational art, and organizational adjustment. Simple introduction of
new technology or military platform does not constitute an MTR.

As Andrew F. Krepinevich, a defence policy analyst, writes,\[4\] a
real-world example of military technical revolution can be unmanned
combat vehicles and their role in conducting combat and ISR operations.
Another example are cyber defence/offense oriented forces that fulfil
the following criteria: technological change---introduction of new
military platforms; evolution of military systems; operational
innovation (e.g., cyberspace defence planning); or organizational
adaptation impacting force structure and organizational units.

[A military revolution in effect alters the way in which power is
projected. Apart from changing the shape and form of warfare, it spills
over from the military organizational structures and battlefields into
societal, economic, and political domains.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} above-mentioned [enablers of military
revolution]{.underline}, [such as a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence [and quantum tech]{.underline}nology
[applications]{.underline}, [show promising potential in changing the
current societal fabric and effectively impacting societal, political,
and military affairs.]{.underline}

[Among the decisive factors]{.underline}, [universal to all combat
operations]{.underline}, [is time. As the pace of
tech]{.underline}nological [advancement increases, [the]{.mark}
potential [effects of]{.mark} a [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[are
no longer the most important factor. Equally important is **the pace of
adaption**]{.mark}: how **fast** a tech]{.underline}nology [can be
utilized and how it recalibrates the relation between action and
reaction. As time remains of immense importance, the ability to share
info]{.underline}rmation [and move forces around based on that
info]{.underline}rmation [can be the decisive factor in conflict. The
speed of info]{.underline}rmation [sharing can thus be considered a
military revolution.]{.underline}\[5\] The introduction of combustion
engines and the changes it brought to operational art, manoeuvring, and
transport of forces, changed the time factor. Unparalleled sensory
awareness, communication, and automation have the same potential.

Consequently, time available for decision-making will continue to
shrink. Decision makers will have to be equipped with information and
intelligence as accurate as possible. The "speed of information" will be
critical to provide political guidance to commanders or even to conduct
a pre-emptive strike. There may be instances when the pace of combat
operations will increase to a threshold where defensive action will be
rendered useless.\[6\] Technology that can process this "speed of
information" will affect the entire decision-making algorithm and
broader perception of security and defence in society.

Militarization of Technology and the Role of Private Sector

The 21st century introduced an unparalleled speed of innovation and
dissemination of (digital) technology among the general population and
the private sector. It also hindered states' ability to remain the sole
proprietor of military grade applications. This is due to an
unprecedented redistribution of applied research from the government
level towards the private sector. Today, private entities commercialize
disruptive technologies and provide them directly to the customers,
unleashing military level applications into the wild. The governments,
namely national security and defence domains are lagging behind in
adoption of innovative technologies. This is evident from the spending
on military research and development, which is dim in comparison to its
private sector equivalents.\[7\] For example, in 2004, the global
spending on civilian research and development was approximately ten
times as large as global military research and development.\[8\]

[Emerging disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [are]{.underline} thus
[becoming **more accessible**. The interdependency between state
instruments of power (including armed forces) and civilian
tech]{.underline}nology [is growing and is expected to grow even
further. In the past, military platforms were developed by the private
sector, but their sole purpose was defined by the military. Today's
world brings the challenge of [dual-use tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
[that is researched, manufactured, and provided entirely by the private
sector]{.underline}, [while having military application. Which
effectively [impacts]{.mark} the [competitiveness on the
battlefield.]{.mark}]{.underline} With facial recognition, targeting,
and other artificial intelligence-powered applications (including micro
targeting on social networks), the interest of the private sector and
state actors overlap and are often blurred. [It is common for state
actors to be dependent on private sector providers.]{.underline}
Sometimes to the extent where the government is unable to adjust the
technologies' conditions for its purposes, as the usual customer base
lies in the civilian business world.

The rise of corporations and digital tycoons brought about
democratization of technologies and their global spread in an
unprecedented speed, resulting in a digital interdependency. States have
been replaced by private entities who hold the keys to information flow
and disruptive technologies. These technologies are often introduced to
the general public sooner than the governmental bodies even have a
chance to understand them.

[Tech]{.underline}nological [superiority has always played a significant
role in i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations[. It usually
derived from the use of force and was traditionally in the hands of the
state. In the past few decades, non-state entities started surpassing
the state's control. Tech]{.underline}nology [provided by corporations
paired with ideology and strategic interests of various state
actors.]{.underline} However, [[state actors]{.underline}]{.mark} were
not equipped with proper organizational structures and decision-making
processes to stay up to date. As result, they [[have been left behind
not to **lead**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[but to **react** to
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [progress and
[innovations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Quantum research on sensors\[9\] can be an example of the private
sector's success. Non-state actors currently both employ the leading
scientists in the field and conduct research in cooperation with
competing state interests. All that despite the efforts of the
governmental bodies and the military to fund innovative research.\[10\]
This substantially increases the prospects of quantum related
applications being provided to the general population before they are
utilized by the military, leading to a loss in competitiveness on the
battlefield.

The issue is caused by the inability of governmental entities to
appreciate the need to conduct basic and applied research competitively
with the private sector. In order for it to be done correctly, it would
require a substantial organizational change and the ability to
understand the potential impacts of disruptive technologies. That is
also necessary for proper resource allocation. Modern and disruptive
technologies are part of the non-conventional military risks and
destabilizing efforts that governmental structures fail to address. A
number of technological platforms, social networks, and digital enablers
have become tools of digital deceit. They have been used to target the
general population, which was unaware of being exposed to hybrid tactics
and military grade influence operations.\[11\] This was enabled by
overlaps of influence-operation techniques from the military field into
the private sector. Private companies also applied these techniques in
target group advertising.

[This is not the first time the West has had to deal with ideological
competitors trying to gain supremacy. The Cold War was about **both**
ideology and tech]{.underline}nology, with the stark example of
Operation Farewell.\[12\] Even then, [tech]{.underline}nological
[superiority was meant to promote ideological and strategic
interests.]{.underline} The combination of ideology and technology
continued to be a factor in the post-Cold War world. An example of that
can be terrorist organizations and their use of basic available
technology. The situation in 2021 is, however, starkly different from
the 1980's or the 2000s for a number of reasons:

\* As argued earlier, the character of warfare has changed profoundly;
technologically driven warfare has entered the soft power arena.

\* The pace of military operations and general interactions has
increased--- he human capacity is now limited not only by the speed of
events but also by the amount of information collected, processed, and
analysed from the battlefield. The ISR platforms are collecting so much
data and raw intelligence that it is necessary to automate processes
previously not constrained by human capacity or reaction speed demands.
The changes pushing the limits of human operators and analysts happen in
leaps and are fast paced.

\* What is more: private sector capacities play a significant role in
international power competition. Technological tycoons represent
stand-alone actors risen on the wealth and influence of the technology
they provide. They have also become the tools of state influence.
Understanding this shift is hard, as we tend to differentiate between
private entities, corporations with presence on the global markets, and
state actors. However, in many cases, the private corporations are bound
by national legislation, hiding as agents of influence in plain sight.

\* As a result, we see traditional technological powers (the West, led
by the United States, with Europe lagging behind) and democratic tech
tycoons, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, capitalizing on the
asymmetry provided by modern technologies. While China, Russia, and
India aspire to supersede them, this aspiration is evident from both
their official policies and their investment in new technologies and
defence modernization. What started as mainly intellectual property
transfer and theft\[13\] has now turned into a full-fledged
technological adoption race.\[14\]

Implications for NATO

So where does all this leave NATO? In 2021, as
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} has already begun to define its vision for
the next ten years, it [[faces]{.mark} three principle
[challenges:]{.mark}]{.underline}

1\. [[Ensuring]{.mark} that [decision-makers **understand the**]{.mark}
**sheer [potential]{.mark}** derived from emerging and disruptive
tech]{.underline}nologies [and **how they will [impact]{.mark}** the
Alliance's governance and decision models.]{.underline}

2\. [[Prioritizing **what** tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies, [[the
Alliance should pursue, **when**, and **how they fit** into
NATO's]{.mark} wider [posture;]{.mark}]{.underline}

3\. **[[Sharing the tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological [[burden
equally]{.mark} across the Alliance.]{.underline}

Raising awareness among political leaders about the new technologies'
impact on NATO may not be as simple as it seems. Currently, [there is a
**growing gap in perception** of the new tech]{.underline}nology['s
importance between the political and military level. Military
authorities of the Alliance have]{.underline}, [for a long
time]{.underline}, [been highlighting the need for innovation and
adoption of new tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}\[15\] [Trials
of innovative tech]{.underline}nological [solutions and new capabilities
have been part of NATO's military training and exercises.]{.underline}
For example, NATO now regularly tests unmanned systems in the maritime
area\[16\] and there is work being done in the area of Electronic
Spectrum warfare. Furthermore, adoption of new technologies in new
capabilities development has been encouraged through the NATO Defence
Planning Process (NDPP). In 2018, the Allied Command Transformation
developed Emerging and Disruptive Technologies Roadmap, which received
political endorsement at the meeting of defence ministers in June 2019.

[On the political front, the effort has been slower.]{.underline} Until
recently, the Allies themselves have maintained a rather declaratory
approach to technology and innovation. Later, in 2020, the Secretary
General appointed an innovation advisory group to provide counsel on
NATO's next steps in the tech area. A full political strategy on the
emerging and disruptive technologies was finally adopted at the Brussels
Summit in June 2021: "\[T\]his strategy seeks to preserve our
interoperability; safeguard our sensitive technologies; and actively
address the threats and challenges posed by technological developments
by others, both now and in the future. Drawing on the extensive
innovation expertise of all 30 Allies, we will further leverage our
partnerships, including with the private sector and academia, to
maintain our technological edge.\[17\]"

[The [Allies pledged to launch]{.mark}]{.underline} a civil-military
Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and]{.mark} to establish a
[N]{.mark}ATO [I]{.mark}nnovation [F]{.mark}und. The aim is to promote
interoperability, foster development and adoption of
tech]{.underline}nological [solutions, and to allow individual NATO
Members to support start-ups working on dual use emerging and disruptive
tech]{.underline}nologies [relevant to NATO's security.]{.underline} The
Allies also agreed to continue developing capabilities in the
technological domain and recognized the need for research and
development and innovation to meet the challenges emerging and
disruptive technologies pose. Some of the specific areas where new
capabilities must be acquired are air-to-air refuelling, training,
precision strike, munitions, air defence, CBRN defence, autonomous
systems, and next-generation rotorcraft capability.\[18\]

[[The process will require **effective prioritization**.]{.mark}
The]{.underline} afore-mentioned [NATO Defence Planning Process already
accounts for future tech]{.underline}nological [change in military
capability development. [Allies have a free reign in how they wish to
meet the target]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including what platform and
tech]{.underline}nology [they wish to choose. [The pitfall]{.mark} of
this approach [lies in]{.mark} the traditional view of military
tech]{.underline}nology [adoption and capability
development.]{.underline} More specifically, [the issue is [the
**government-centric model**]{.mark} that operates with significantly
longer lifecycles as well as the ownership structures that find no
applicable parallel in the private sector's current pacing and push out
of emerging and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[It will be up to NATO to use both its new and already-existing tools to
help navigate through these tech]{.underline}nologies [and decide on
which to adopt first. Together with the Allies and the private sector,
[NATO/DIANA should]{.mark} scan the horizon and [say which new
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[are to be integrated with highest
priority.]{.mark} NATO must then proceed with the integration into its
planning]{.underline} (both capability and civil emergency)[, training
and exercises]{.underline}, [as well as the Alliance's wider
consultation and decision-making.]{.underline}

[The [adoption must happen **systematically**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[at
the **highest political level**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Brussels
Summit should be an impulse for the Council to start incorporating more
technologically driven discussions into its deliberations.
Scenario-based discussions and NATO's high-level exercise program should
include situations where emerging and disruptive technologies play a
decisive role. [None of this requires any radical changes to the
decision-making procedures or new tools.]{.underline}

[[Although]{.mark} the NATO Innovation Fund is **[a step in the right
direction]{.mark}**, [it must reflect the **disparities**]{.mark} that
exist [among]{.mark} individual Member [States]{.mark} in this context.
[Many]{.mark} Allies [have **national assets**]{.mark} that fulfil
various tech innovation functions.]{.underline} For example, the UK's
jHub Defence Innovation helps integrate market-ready solutions into
military.\[19\] In 2020, Germany established an agency for innovation in
cyber security to promote technological innovation and solutions that
would enhance the country's security.\[20\] [[NATO should serve as a
platform where nations with]{.mark} **more [advanced structures,
know-how and capabilities come forward and share]{.mark}** some of these
solutions and findings with other Allies.]{.underline}

[[The N]{.mark}ATO [I]{.mark}nnovation [F]{.mark}und [should]{.mark}
also [facilitate **burden-sharing**]{.mark} in this area.
[Emerging]{.mark} and disruptive [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies
[[have]{.mark} so far [been **guarded** as a **national treasure**;
their]{.mark} application and [availability]{.mark} in multinational
context [has been **scarce**.]{.mark} In the future, not all Allies will
possess or have access to new tech]{.underline}nologies [shaping the
military capabilities and conduct. Some countries will be faster in
tech]{.underline}nological [adoption. Others may not be able to afford
new tech]{.underline}nologies, [if they are to meet all other
requirements for NATO's collective defence. [The Fund can be a mechanism
that **balances out these gaps** and **spreads the burden more
equally**]{.mark} among the Allies. NATO must now design a system of
allocation]{.underline}---currently envisioned on a voluntary
basis---[that will motivate the Allies to contribute to it. [This must
take into account **national requirements**]{.mark} that might be
limiting for some Allies [and **the danger of duplicity**]{.mark} **with
similar endeavours**.]{.underline}

[There are **several examples of sharing mechanisms** that NATO has
successfully adopted in the past and can now build on]{.underline}: 1)
Nuclear-sharing arrangements where non-nuclear members of NATO support
potential nuclear missions and the decision-making without possessing
the nuclear technology; 2) Common-funded capability models, such as the
Allied Ground Surveillance system or NATO's Ballistic Missile Defence,
where Allies fund and outsource the development of technology through
common / joint financial contributions; while both slightly different in
structure and funding, both are an example of technology funded by some
Allies, but made available to the entire Alliance. Both examples link to
previous revolutions in military affairs. Until now, the closest the
Allies have come to having a new technology sharing mechanism is the
Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies mechanism. It
allows the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) to request offensive
effects to be delivered on a designated target, without sharing the
technology with others.\[21\]

[All these examples have one thing in common: tech]{.underline}nological
[know-how and i]{.underline}ntellectual [p]{.underline}roperty [remains
in the hands of the capability providers. This gives NATO an opportunity
to **forge [new]{.mark} tech-sharing [arrangements]{.mark}** [that would
include **individual Allies** and **the private sector**]{.mark}. This
[could]{.mark} also **[prevent the tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological
[**[gap]{.mark} among Allies [from widening]{.mark}** any
further.]{.underline}

One specific solution could be creating a private sector parallel to
NATO's political partnerships. However, the criteria for such
partnerships might be hard to agree on. NATO would have to find a way to
satisfy some highly political questions, such as: What companies and
what technologies would be represented? Or would Allies even be able and
willing to generate funds to support a NATO-branded research &
development?

In the meantime, NATO must approach the prioritization of emerging and
disruptive technologies by employing its traditional strengths: define
its technological requirements through the prism of military
requirements and forge a consensus among thirty Allies on the general
technological pathway. [When NATO **sets the standards**, individual
Allies are usually very capable of delivering]{.underline}, [according
to their national preferences and legislation.]{.underline}

Lastly, [in its ongoing efforts to address the challenge of emerging and
disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies, [NATO must take into account
similar]{.underline}, [already existing or maturing projects and
structures.]{.underline} The European Union sees emerging and disruptive
technologies as a crucial issue and has developed mechanisms through
which they are tackled. The European Defence Agency recognizes
technological development as one of the main pillars of its work and
provides a useful platform for international cooperation. It aims to
support Member States in developing and improving capabilities on a
cutting-edge technological level of its Member States and shape their
national strategies in this area. The European Defence Fund deals with
both technological research and defence capability development and even
specifically allocates a part of its financial resources for disruptive
technologies.

[[A major task]{.underline}]{.mark} for the two organizations
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[be to]{.mark} find a way to
**[cooperate]{.mark}** on this issue [and **avoid**]{.mark}
**undesirable [duplication]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Alliance
and the EU must come up with a solution where the EuroAtlantic area is
capable of adapting to the ever-changing security environment and can
readily adopt fast-advancing technologies. What is more, both sides of
the Atlantic must be equally capable partners in this cooperation and
burden sharing.

Conclusion

[Tech]{.underline}nological [change is **real**, **fast paced**, and
**greatly affects** NATO's civilian-military structures. Never has the
Alliance faced so many tech]{.underline}nological [changes that would
reach beyond the traditional realm of security and defence.]{.underline}

In the 1990s, [the key political question for the future of
NATO]{.underline} was whether to adapt by going out of area (in terms of
operations and membership) or go out of business. The question for the
next couple of years is essentially the same; it [touches the very
purpose and existence of the Alliance and the utility of NATO: How to
make sure that NATO stays tech]{.underline}nologically [relevant so that
it can maintain its function and capabilities. [**Complacency** and
**general political statements** will not suffice.]{.mark} The private
sector]{.underline}, [which is the principal agent of the new kind of
r]{.underline}evolution in [m]{.underline}ilitary [a]{.underline}ffairs,
[is technologically advancing in leaps. If NATO is not able to keep up
with this change in organization of geopolitics and
tech]{.underline}nology, [it will have to change its organizational
structure. With modern and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies
[becoming more mainstream and moving into wider governance structures,
similar adjustments will be necessary in NATO's daily business
operations.]{.underline}

[[NATO **can** successfully navigate the]{.mark} new wave of
[r]{.mark}]{.underline}evolution in [[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ilitary
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}ffairs[; however, [it must]{.mark} first [change
its **political culture** and **overall approach**]{.mark} to modern and
disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies[. [It]{.mark} also [needs]{.mark}
to develop **[new tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology[**[-sharing
mechanisms]{.mark}** that will be fair to all Allies.]{.underline} There
may be different approaches to this change: a reform of NATO's
procurement agencies, a reform of financial mechanisms, or a partnership
reform. Either way, [any such effort will have to build on the **active
participation** of the private sector. [**Only then** will NATO]{.mark}
be able to **[maintain its tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological
[**[edge]{.mark} in the future**.]{.underline}

#### Failing to maintain NATO's technological superiority will cause [great power nuclear war]{.underline} --- out-competing Russia and China in the [EDT RMA]{.underline} is key.

New Tech Arms Race

[Many analysts believe the [emerging tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [of
the 4IR could profoundly affect military capabilities and operational
concepts.]{.underline}35 [New tech]{.underline}nology [[has had
**revolutionary effects**]{.mark} on warfare and international politics
**[throughout history]{.mark}** from the Bronze Age to the gunpowder and
nuclear revolutions.]{.underline}36

[New tech]{.underline}nologies [with direct military application are in
development]{.underline}, [including AI, quantum
info]{.underline}rmation [tech]{.underline}nology[, hypersonic missiles,
directed energy, additive manufacturing, and
biotech]{.underline}nology[. How exactly these technologies will affect
the future of warfare is still uncertain. The]{.underline} \[end page
64\] [National Defense Strategy Commission report charges that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [lacks clear operational
concepts for combat with Russia and China.]{.underline}37
[Still]{.underline}, [there is reason to believe these new
tech]{.underline}nologies [could have meaningful military applications
but perhaps not to the advantage of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its Allies and partners. At present, [Russia
and]{.mark} especially [China might transcend the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its
Allies]{.mark} and partners [in]{.mark} some [key]{.mark} 4IR
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[**AI** could transform]{.mark} the future of
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including through the development of
lethal autonomous systems.]{.underline}38 [These "killer robots" may
lower the threshold of conflict by allowing political leaders to take a
country to war without risking the lives of human soldiers. When
produced in large numbers, these drones could operate in swarms that
overwhelm enemy military platforms and targets.]{.underline}39

[A]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence [could also be
employed to rapidly sort through vast quantities of data, improving
i]{.underline}ntelligence, [s]{.underline}urveillance, and
[r]{.underline}econnaissance [and making it easier to track and target
enemy forces. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [retains
important advantages in AI]{.underline}, [including through its
world-leading university system. But China]{.underline}, [with its large
population and surveillance tactics]{.underline}, [has access to more
data to train its AI algorithms.]{.underline}40 [Beijing is also less
constrained by ethical and moral concerns and has the lead in some
applications of AI]{.underline}, [including facial-recognition
tech]{.underline}nology[.]{.underline}

[**Quantum computing** promises information advantages including the
ability to have secure, encrypted communications and to decode enemy
communications.]{.underline} In its 2021 Military Balance report, the
International Institute for Strategic Studies states, "the integration
of quantum technologies currently represents one of the most anticipated
advances for armed forces. ... [There is little doubt that they will
have disruptive effect when they are employed at scale.]{.underline}"41
[China may have the edge in this area]{.underline}, [as it was the first
country to conduct a successful test of a quantum
satellite.]{.underline}42

[[**Space** and **cyber** are increasingly important]{.mark} military
domains. Space-based weapons, sensors, defensive interceptors, and the
diffusion of counterspace capabilities will make space an increasingly
contested military environment.]{.underline}43 [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is relatively more dependent on space-based assets
and computers than its rivals]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} US
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [warns
Russia and China will likely employ cyber and counter- space attacks in
the early stage of any conflict with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [in a bid to disrupt US]{.underline} command,
control, communications, computers, intel- ligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance ([C4ISR]{.underline})[.]{.underline}44

**[Hypersonic missiles]{.underline}**, maneuverable and able to travel
at over five times the speed of sound, [could allow states to conduct
low- or no-warning attacks]{.underline} \[end page 65\] [and to evade
missile defenses.]{.underline}45 [These weapons could also execute
large-scale]{.underline}, [nonnuclear strategic attacks, the rate of
speed compressing the decision-making time leaders have to respond to
such attacks. Although the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[developed the initial concepts for these weapons, Russia and China have
prioritized their production, testing, and deployment. China has
conducted more hypersonic tests than any other nation]{.underline}, [and
Moscow and Beijing have deployed hypersonic weapons.]{.underline}46

[Many other emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [have military
applications. **Directed-energy microwaves and lasers** could allow
states to develop more effective integrated air and missile defense
systems or to degrade an enemy's command and control.]{.underline}47
[**Additive manufacturing** could greatly reduce the cost of producing
component parts of military platforms and creates the potential for
large and rapid quantitative increases in weapons systems]{.underline},
[from drones and tanks to submarines and nuclear weapons.]{.underline}48

**[[Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology [[could]{.mark} be exploited to
[produce "super soldiers."]{.mark} China has genetically engineered
beagles with three times the muscle mass of a typical canine, a
tech]{.underline}nology [that could possibly be applied to
humans.]{.underline}49 [Exoskeletons could provide soldiers with
superhuman strength]{.underline}, [and brain implants promise superior
cognitive performance. China employed exoskeletons in combat in its 2020
border conflict with India.]{.underline}50

[It is not yet clear how these new tech]{.underline}nologies, [when
combined with novel operational concepts]{.underline}, [will affect the
future of warfare, but it is likely they will. A future state
may]{.underline}, [for example]{.underline}, [be able to use additive
manufacturing to produce masses of inexpensive drones directed by new AI
algorithms to swarm and overwhelm adversaries.]{.underline}51 [The
attack might be preceded by cyber and counterspace attacks that blind an
adversary and disrupt its command and control.]{.underline}

[Following a successful advance, the country could then employ
directed-energy weapons, autonomous mines, and other advanced defenses
to lock in territorial gains and thwart enemy attempts to roll back its
aggression. It is possible that **[the first state to hone these
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies [and devise effective operational
concepts [will have a **military edge**]{.mark} over its
opponents.]{.underline}

Novel Applications

How will states use such a newfound advantage? Technology rarely
fundamentally changes the nature or objectives of states. More often,
[[states use tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to advance **preexisting
geopolitical aims**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Moreover, [[enhanced power can
result in greater ambition.]{.mark} Given the geopolitical
landscape]{.underline} described, [it is likely the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its Allies and partners at the
core]{.underline} \[end page 66\] [of the international system will
behave differently with new military tech]{.underline}nologies [than
will revisionist powers]{.underline}, [such as Russia and
China.]{.underline}

[[The spread of new tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its
Allies]{.mark} and partners [would]{.mark} likely serve]{.underline},
[on balance]{.underline}, [to **[reinforce]{.mark} the existing sources
of [stability]{.mark}** in the prevailing international
system.]{.underline} At the end of the Cold War, the United States and
its Allies and partners achieved a technological- military advantage
over its great power rivals, with the US using its unipolar position to
deepen and expand a rules-based system. They also employed their
military dominance to counter perceived threats from rogue states and
terrorist networks. The United States, its Allies, and partners did not,
however, engage in military aggression against great power,
nuclear-armed rivals or their allies.

[In the future, [these]{.mark} status quo [powers]{.mark} are apt to
[use military advantages to]{.mark} reinforce their position in the
international system and to [deter attacks]{.mark} against Allies and
partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. [These]{.mark} states [might
also]{.mark} employ military power to [deal with threats posed by
**terrorist networks** or]{.mark} by regional revisionist powers such as
[**Iran** and **North Korea**.]{.mark} But it is extremely difficult to
imagine scenarios in which Washington or its Allies or partners would
use newfound military advantages provided by emerging
tech]{.underline}nology [to conduct an armed attack against Russia or
China.]{.underline}

Similarly, [[Moscow and Beijing would]{.mark} likely use any newfound
military strength to advance their preexisting geopolitical
aims.]{.underline} Given their very different positions in the
international system, however, [these states are likely to
[employ]{.mark} new military [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[in
ways that are **destabilizing**.]{.mark} These states have made clear
their dissatisfaction with the existing international system and their
desire to revise it. Both countries have ongoing border disputes with
multiple neighboring countries.]{.underline}

[If [Moscow]{.mark} developed new military tech]{.underline}nologies
[and operational concepts that shifted the balance of power in its
favor, it [would]{.mark} likely use this advantage to [pursue
**revisionist aims**. If Moscow acquired]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}found
[ability to]{.mark} more easily [invade and occupy territory]{.mark} in
Eastern Europe]{.underline}, [for example (or if Putin believed Russia
had such a capability)]{.underline}, [[it is more likely Russia
would]{.mark} be tempted to [engage in aggression.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Likewise, [[if China acquired]{.mark} an enhanced ability through new
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[to invade and occupy Taiwan
or]{.mark} contested islands in [the E]{.mark}]{.underline}ast [[or
S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}eas, [[Beijing]{.mark}'s leaders [might]{.mark}
also [find this]{.mark} opportunity [tempting.]{.mark} If new
tech]{.underline}nology [enhances either power's anti-access,
area-denial network]{.underline}, then [its leaders may be more
confident in their ability to achieve a fait accompli attack against a
neighbor and then block a US-led liberation.]{.underline} \[end page
67\]

[[These]{.mark} are precisely the types of [shifts]{.mark} in the
balance of power that [can lead to **war**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As
mentioned previously, [the predominant scholarly theory on the causes of
war---the bargaining model---maintains that imperfect information on the
balance of power and the balance of resolve and credible commitment
problems result in international conflict.]{.underline}52 [New
tech]{.underline}nology [can exacerbate these causal mechanisms by
increasing uncertainty about]{.underline}, [or causing rapid shifts
in]{.underline}, [the balance of power.]{.underline} Indeed as noted
above, [[new]{.mark} military [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [and the
development of new operational concepts [have]{.mark} shifted the
balance of power and [resulted in]{.mark} military [conflict
**throughout history**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Some may argue emerging military tech]{.underline}nology [is more
likely to result in a new tech arms race than in conflict. This is
possible. But Moscow and Beijing may come to believe (correctly or not)
that new tech]{.underline}nology [provides them a usable military
advantage over the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its
Allies and partners. In so doing, they may underestimate
Washington.]{.underline}

[[If Moscow or Beijing attacked a]{.mark} vulnerable [US Ally]{.mark} or
partner in their near abroad]{.underline}, therefore, [[there would be a
risk of **major war** with]{.mark} the potential for [**nuclear
escalation**.]{.mark} The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
formal treaty commitments with several frontline states as well as an
ambiguous defense obligation to Taiwan. If Russia or China were to
attack these states, it is likely]{.underline}, [or at least
possible]{.underline}, [that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would come to the defense of the victims. While
many question the wisdom or credibility of America's global commitments,
[it would be difficult for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to]{.mark} simply [back down.]{.mark}
Abandoning a treaty ally could cause fears that America's global
commitments would unravel. Any US president]{.underline}, therefore,
[would feel great pressure to come to an Ally's defense and expel
Russian or Chinese forces.]{.underline}

[[Once the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and Russia or China are at war]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[there would be
a risk of **nuclear escalation**.]{.underline}]{.mark} As noted
previously, [experts assess the greatest risk of nuclear war today does
**not** come from a **bolt-out-of-the-blue strike** but from nuclear
escalation in a **regional, conventional conflict**.]{.underline}53
[[Russia]{.mark}n leaders [may]{.mark} believe it is in their interest
to [use nuclear weapons early in a conflict]{.mark} with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and NATO.]{.underline}54
[Russia possesses a large and diverse arsenal]{.underline}, [including
thousands of nonstrategic nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [to support this
nuclear strategy.]{.underline}

In the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, [Washington indicates it could
retaliate against any Russian nuclear "de-escalation" strikes with
limited nuclear strikes of its own using low-yield nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}55 [The purpose of US strategy is to deter Russian
strikes. **[If deterrence fails]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [[there
is **a clear pathway to nuclear war**]{.mark} between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia.]{.underline} \[end
page 68\] As Henry Kissinger pointed out decades ago, [there is no
guarantee that]{.underline}, [once begun]{.underline}, [a limited
nuclear war stays limited.]{.underline}56

[There are similar risks of nuclear escalation in the event of a
US-China conflict. China has traditionally possessed a relaxed nuclear
posture with a small "lean and effective" deterrent and a formal "no
first use" policy. But China is relying more on its strategic forces. It
is projected to double---if not triple or quadruple---the size of its
nuclear arsenal in the coming decade]{.underline}.57

[Chinese experts have acknowledged there is a narrow range of
contingencies in which China might use nuclear weapons
first.]{.underline}58 As in the case of Russia, [the US Nuclear Posture
Review recognizes the possibility of limited Chinese nuclear attacks and
also holds out the potential of a limited US reprisal with low-yield
nuclear weapons as a deterrent.]{.underline}59 [If the nuclear threshold
is breached in a conflict between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China, **the risk of nuclear exchange is
real**.]{.underline}

In short, [if [a coming r]{.mark}]{.underline}evolution in
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ilitary [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}ffairs
[[provides]{.mark} a [real or perceived]{.mark} battlefield [advantage
for Russia or China]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such a development [raises
the likelihood of **armed aggression against**]{.mark} **US regional
[allies]{.mark}**[, **major power war**, and]{.mark} **an increased risk
of [nuclear escalation]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Implications

Future scholarship should incorporate geopolitical conditions and the
related foreign policy goals of the states in question when theorizing
the effects of technology on international politics. Often scholars
attempt to conceptualize the effects of weapons systems in isolation
from the political context in which they are embedded.

Studies treat technology as disembodied from geopolitics and as exerting
independent effects on the international system. But technology does not
float freely. [Tech]{.underline}nology [is a tool different actors can
use in different ways. Bakers and arsonists employ fire in their crafts
to strikingly different ends. In the current international environment,
[Russia and China would]{.mark} tend to employ tech]{.underline}nology
[toward advancing revisionist aims. Tech]{.underline}nological [advances
in these countries are]{.underline} therefore [much more likely to
**[disrupt the]{.mark} prevailing [international order]{.mark}** [and
**nuclear strategic stability**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

This approach also suggests [the potential threat new
tech]{.underline}nology [poses to nuclear strategic stability is **more
pervasive** than previously understood. To undermine strategic
stability, new tech]{.underline}nology [need **not** directly impact
strategic capabilities.]{.underline} Rather, [[**any**
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[that promises to shift the]{.mark}
local [balance of power]{.mark} in Eastern Europe or the Indo-Pacific
[has]{.mark} the [potential to **threaten nuclear strategic
stability**.]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end page 69\]

[This understanding of this issue leads to different policy
prescriptions. If the tech]{.underline}nology [itself is the problem,
then it must be controlled and should not be allowed to spread to any
states. In contrast, the framework outlined here suggests a different
recommendation: preserve the prevailing balance of power in Europe and
Asia. [Tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [[change
that]{.underline}]{.mark}, [on balance]{.underline}, [[**reinforces**
the prevailing]{.mark} international [system should **strengthen**
stability.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Leading democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [therefore]{.underline},
[[should **increase investments in emerging
tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology **[[to maintain a
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological [**[edge]{.mark}** over their
adversaries.]{.underline} Export control and nonproliferation measures
should be designed to deny emerging military technology to Russia and
China. Arms control should be negotiated with the primary objective of
sustaining the current international distribution of power. [Making
progress in these areas will be difficult. But the [consequences of
failure could be **shifts in the**]{.mark} **international [balance of
power]{.mark}**[, **conflict among great powers**, and]{.mark} **an
increased risk of [nuclear war]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Giving]{.mark} our armed [forces]{.mark} the [proper
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [to perform their mission
[will]{.mark} ultimately [ensure]{.mark} that [**deterrence never
fails**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The key]{.mark} to effective deterrence for the transatlantic alliance
[is **speed**]{.mark}: speed of recognition of the Kremlin's malign
activities; speed of decision to start necessary deployments, movements
and related activities; and speed of assembly to move faster than the
Kremlin to pre-empt attacks and signal our preparedness to act.
Fortunately, a wide range of new tech]{.underline}nologies [are emerging
and evolving that can improve speed]{.underline}, [if they are properly
integrated into our armed forces and into our plans.]{.underline}

[[New tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [that have the greatest
potential to this end include a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[, machine learning, automated systems,
hypersonics, and cyber tech]{.underline}nologies, [among others. All
these tools [can enhance decision-making, improve
interoperability]{.mark} of mission command systems and logistics, help
[counter]{.mark} adversaries' [unmanned]{.mark} air and maritime
[systems, and]{.mark} facilitate material changes to [improve]{.mark}
military [mobility. Key to **maximizing the impact**]{.mark} of these
new tech]{.underline}nologies, [and to making the investment
worthwhile]{.underline}, [[is **coordination** among]{.mark} political
[decision-makers and **industry innovators**]{.mark} to understand
Allies' needs and meet capability requirements.]{.underline}

[Below are some examples of those needs and corresponding
tech]{.underline}nological [requirements.]{.underline} Though in need of
refinement, these provide an azimuth for innovators, policymakers and
industry leaders across the transatlantic community to improve our
collective speed and enhance effective deterrence.

[[Need for Speed of **Recognition**]{.mark}: Recognizing threats,
indicators, and warnings from our adversaries has become increasingly
difficult within the context of hybrid warfare. Unlike in the Cold War,
when the first indicator of an attack may have been T72 tanks coming
over the horizon, today]{.underline}, [the first indicator may be a
cyber-attack that shuts down transportation or financial systems. It
could be a dockworkers' strike in a Baltic port]{.underline}, [or even
attacks on transportation infrastructure by hypersonic missiles. [Being
able to see]{.mark} these [possibilities]{.mark} as they are taking
shape]{.underline}, **[[before they are
effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[is necessary to **prevent** or
**respond**]{.mark} to an emerging crisis.]{.underline}

[Requirement: [Tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[that can fuse]{.mark}
the wide range and variety of [intel]{.mark}ligence [and
info]{.mark}rmation [as part of]{.mark} NATO's [**indicators** and
**warnings network** are vital.]{.mark}]{.underline} A U.S. satellite
will most likely not be the first system to detect a hybrid threat or
activity. Instead, it could be a human source, perhaps a customs agent,
border guard, or member of a territorial force. But how does information
about a dockworkers' strike in a Baltic port turn into analysis, for
instance, that reveals this strike was created artificially by FSB
operatives to create a pretext for the Kremlin to interfere abroad? [The
key lies in the ability to quickly and accurately parse through all
available data and reports]{.underline} --- across national and
interagency boundaries, NATO and non-NATO nations, five-eye and
non-five-eye nations --- [using a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[, machine learning, and other fusion
capabilities. This also requires protecting]{.underline} information
[networks from hacks, malware, and other attacks]{.underline}, all the
[while facilitating the sharing of sensitive and classified
info]{.underline}rmation, [using **sophisticated cyber
defenses**.]{.underline}

[[Need for Speed of **Decision**]{.mark}: Authorizing movements and
actions to prevent or respond to an emerging crisis]{.underline},
[within a NATO context]{.underline}, [requires the unanimous consent of
all 30 member states. [Decisions]{.mark} to start moving capabilities,
pull ammunition]{.underline} such as Patriot "Interceptors" [out of
storage depots, and reprioritize military movements]{.underline},
[[demand]{.mark} high-level [decision-makers]{.mark} to [act quickly and
decisively]{.mark}]{.underline}, [despite the sensitive nature of these
activities. [The Kremlin]{.mark} is fully aware of NATO's
decision-making process, the requirement for unanimous consent, and the
political reluctance to delegate such decisions about movement to
operational commanders, and they [aim to **exploit that gap**]{.mark}
through their own centralized decision-making.]{.underline}

[Requirement: This means Allied and partner political decision-makers
need to have access to a variety of info]{.underline}rmation[, plans,
options, and shared courses of action to create appropriate signals and
communicate tasks to commanders in a timely manner. That's why [it's
critical to leverage tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [such as
synthetic environments and human augmentation]{.underline}, [[which can
enable]{.mark} Allied political [leaders to simulate]{.mark} complex,
multi-domain environments, [test]{.mark} time-sensitive decision-making,
and physiological responses, [and course-correct in advance]{.mark}
through sustained exercises and training.]{.underline}

[[Need for Speed of **Assembly**: NATO must demonstrate that allies are
able to move as fast]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[or faster
than]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Russia]{.mark}n Federation forces to
prevent or react to an emerging crisis. The key is signaling to the
Kremlin that any malign activities will either fail or be too costly to
attempt.]{.underline} Still, [NATO must do this in such a way that it
does not unnecessarily provoke or escalate tensions with Russia. [This
requires assembling]{.mark} key forces and capabilities [**quickly** and
**strategically**]{.mark} in pre-crisis or peacetime
conditions.]{.underline}

[Requirement: In order to assemble fast enough,
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[are needed to protect against
**cyber-attacks**]{.mark} against transportation and power-generation
infrastructure and reduce the weight and size of modern armored vehicles
which are difficult to move quickly across the continent to the
frontline. Using tech]{.underline}nology [to develop affordable bridging
assets necessary for the many river crossings in Europe]{.underline},
[as well as to protect against Russian unmanned systems and create a
NATO]{.underline} anti-access aerial denial ([A2AD]{.underline})
[bubble]{.underline}, [should be priorities. Automated
systems]{.underline} --- from robots and drones to active cyber defense
as well as new missile technologies --- [can play crucial roles in
protecting allied and partner deployments and critical
infrastructure.]{.underline}

At the end of the day, [deterrence depends on]{.underline} the women and
men of our [armed forces being trained and ready. Giving them the
[proper tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [to perform their mission
[will]{.mark} give them the advantages needed to [improve awareness,
preparedness, and speed and]{.mark}]{.underline}, ultimately,
[**[ensure]{.mark} that [deterrence never
fails]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Vladimir [Putin's]{.underline} "unprovoked, unjustified, unconscionable
[war]{.underline}" [has taken thousands of lives, destroyed much of
Ukraine's modern infrastructure and ancient landmarks, and created the
largest tidal wave of refugees in Europe since World War II. Yet amidst
all these horrors, there's a **flicker of hope**: The [NATO]{.mark}
alliance [is **more united** than]{.mark} at [any time since
9/11]{.mark} -- [and **more important** than]{.mark} at [any time since
11/9.]{.mark} This is the very opposite of what Putin
expected.]{.underline}

**[Common cause]{.underline}**

[Consider how the]{.underline} 30-member [alliance swiftly rejected
Putin's]{.underline} December [demands that NATO not expand to include
Ukraine, cease its deterrence operations in Eastern Europe and grant him
veto authority over the decisions of sovereign nations.
Then]{.underline}, as Putin massed more than 180,000 troops, hundreds of
tanks and dozens of warships on Ukraine's borders and coasts, [the
alliance set about the task of bolstering its easternmost
members.]{.underline}

The United States deployed B-52s to Britain; F-35s to Germany, Lithuania
and Estonia; F-15s to Poland and Estonia; F-16s to Romania; dozens of
AH-64 attack helicopters to the Baltics and Poland; Patriot air-defense
batteries and thousands of combat troops to Poland; an armored brigade
combat team of 7,000 soldiers to Germany; hundreds of troops to Hungary,
Bulgaria and Romania; and 800 combat troops to the Baltics. There are
now about 100,000 U.S. troops standing guard all across Europe.

In addition, Washington approved a long-delayed sale of 250 M1A2 tanks
to Poland, and surged the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman to join
carrier strike groups from Italy and France in a show of force in the
northern Mediterranean.

Britain has deployed hundreds of troops to Poland, sent warships to the
Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean, dispatched Challenger tanks to the
Baltics, doubled its troop commitment in Estonia, and based
fighter-bombers in Romania and Poland. Canada has deployed hundreds of
additional troops to augment its battlegroup in Latvia. Germany has sent
troops to reinforce its contingent in Lithuania. France has deployed
hundreds of troops to Romania. Germany and the Netherlands sent Patriot
batteries to Slovakia. Denmark rushed F-16s to Lithuania and sent a
frigate to the Baltic Sea. Dutch F-35s and Spanish Eurofighters deployed
to Bulgaria. NATO now has 130 warplanes on "high alert" in Central and
Eastern Europe, more than 200 ships forward-deployed in the waters of
the Arctic, North Atlantic, Baltic, Aegean, Adriatic and Mediterranean,
and tens of thousands of newly deployed or repositioned combat troops in
the region, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

[For the first time in history, NATO activated and deployed its
rapid-response force. And for just the second time in history,
Turkey]{.underline} -- acting under international authorities it was
granted by a 1936 treaty -- [closed the Black Sea to Russian
warships.]{.underline}

[NATO hasn't limited its response within its footprint. In
a]{.underline} ~~crippling~~ \[[crushing]{.underline}\] [blow to
Russia's economy, NATO members, the EU, Japan and other partners
disconnected Russian banks from SWIFT]{.underline}, the global messaging
system that enables financial transfers among 11,000 banks in 200
countries[. Britain, Canada and the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [joined the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and other partners in imposing "unprecedented export control measures"
to cut off Russia's access to high-tech products. The allies closed
their airspace to commercial and private Russian aircraft, seized
Russian assets, and cut off Putin's kleptocracy from the most of the
world.]{.underline}

Specific to Ukraine, before the invasion, the United States flew
reconnaissance flights over eastern and western Ukraine, shared
intelligence with Kiev, and formed an airbridge linking NATO bases with
Ukraine. This enabled delivery of defensive weapons from North America,
Britain and Europe.

When Russia started to fill Ukraine's skies with missiles and artillery,
NATO began delivering weapons overland. In the first six days of the
war, the alliance rushed 17,000 antitank weapons into Ukraine. The
United States has shipped tons of small-arms ammunition, mortar and
artillery shells, Javelin antitank systems, Stinger anti-aircraft
systems, and grenade launchers. Britain has delivered 3,615 antitank
systems, as well as Starstreak antiaircraft missiles. The Baltic nations
have sent antiaircraft missiles and antitank systems. Poland sent
antiaircraft weapons. Turkey has delivered ground-attack drones. In a
stunning reversal, Germany rushed 2,000 antitank weapons and 500
surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. Non-NATO member Sweden delivered
5,000 antitank systems to Ukraine's gallant defenders.

Challenges

[Even so, Putin's war on Ukraine has exposed challenges within
NATO.]{.underline} The most glaring of these revolve around Germany --
namely, Berlin's equivocation over the future of the Russia-to-Germany
Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and Berlin's decision to block delivery of
German-built weapons to Ukraine. These policies prompted some observers
to ask those eternal questions: "Is NATO broken, and is it worth the
trouble?"

The answer to that first question is found in the above paragraphs. It's
impossible to read Putin's mind, but the rapidity and unity of NATO's
response surely came as a surprise to the Russian strongman. Indeed,
NATO's response the past 70 days represents the very opposite of what
happened when Putin mounted his first invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

[The fact [that NATO didn't prevent Putin]{.mark} from moving against
Ukraine **[isn't a]{.mark} NATO [failure]{.mark}**[; it's a function of
the **harsh geopolitical reality**]{.mark} that Ukraine is not a member
of the most important, most enduring security alliance in
history.]{.underline} To be sure, [Europe will be more stable -- and
NATO more secure -- if Ukraine can somehow remain a sovereign,
democratically oriented nation. That explains why the alliance worked so
hard on the diplomatic and military front to make Putin think twice
about this criminal invasion.]{.underline}

[However, [the]{.mark} central [purpose]{.mark} of NATO [is to deter an
attack against]{.mark} its **[members]{.mark}** and, if necessary, to
defend its members from attack.]{.underline} Indeed, [the fact [that
Putin has attacked Ukraine **while keeping his hands off**]{.mark}
**NATO [members]{.mark}** Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland
[underscores that **he respects NATO's**]{.mark} **all-for-one [security
guarantee -- at least for now.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In these weeks of war, Ukraine has shown itself to be a nation of
warriors and a worthy ally. Its Churchillian leader and courageous
people have earned NATO's respect -- and if they survive the hell Putin
has unleashed, a seat at NATO's table. But Russia\'s sheer mass could be
enough to overwhelm Ukraine, especially as Putin employs the beastly
scorched-earth tactics he perfected in Chechnya and Syria.

Headaches

[As to whether the alliance is worth the headaches and heartburn it
causes -- especially for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[-- the answer to that question is found in both the historical record
and today's headlines.]{.underline}

To be sure, Germany's prewar resistance to sending defensive weapons to
Ukraine frustrated its NATO allies, and Germany\'s dependence on
Russia's natural gas has proven to be shortsighted. But it pays to
recall that [NATO overcame **far more worrisome internal challenges in
the past**. Consider the Anglo-French deceptions during the Suez crisis
in]{.underline} 19[56, France throwing out NATO's headquarters and
pulling out of NATO's integrated military command in]{.underline}
1966-19[67, open hostilities between Turkey and Greece in
the]{.underline} 19[70s and]{.underline} 19[80s, and France and Germany
waging a diplomatic war against the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Britain in]{.underline} 2002-20[03 over Iraq's
repeated violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.]{.underline}

[In spite of all of that, NATO **repeatedly proves its importance** to
America's security. Too many Americans forget or simply don't know that
[NATO is a **force-multiplier for U.S. power**, a **bridge to global
hotspots**, a **backstop against great-power war**]{.mark} **in
Europe**, [and a]{.mark} ready-made [structure where]{.mark} like-minded
[nations]{.mark} with shared values and high levels of military
interoperability **[build coalitions]{.mark}** to defend their freedom
and interests. These alliances within [the alliance helped]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[**liberate Kuwait**, **defend
Saudi Arabia**,]{.mark} **wage war and [keep peace in the
Balkans]{.mark}**[, **avenge 9/11**, **topple Saddam**]{.mark}**'s
regime** [and **respond to COVID**]{.mark}**-19**.]{.underline}

Moreover, Germany has now suspended Nord Stream 2. As noted, Germany has
rushed thousands of weapons systems to Ukraine. And in a truly
remarkable about-face, Germany is increasing its annual defense outlays
to 2% of GDP (something Washington and NATO have been begging Berlin to
do since 2006), creating a \$112.7 billion modernization and rearmament
fund, and building a strategic LNG reserve and new LNG terminals.

"The world," German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concludes, "will no longer be
the same as the world before." Or perhaps more accurately, [Europe and
the world are returning to what they were before 11/9, when the Berlin
Wall collapsed.]{.underline}

**[Insurance]{.underline}**

[Throughout the post-Cold War period, [the alliance served as an
**insurance policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [just in case Moscow reverted
to its old ways. And here we are.]{.underline}

[Insurance is a good way to understand NATO. Insurance]{.underline},
after all, [is about providing protection [against **worst-case
scenarios**.]{.mark} Prudent people hope they never have to use
insurance]{.underline}, [but they realize that paying a little each
month or each year protects them against having to pay a lot -- or
losing everything -- if disaster strikes. The same is true in the realm
of international security.]{.underline}

[The deterrent represented by Article V]{.underline} of the North
Atlantic Treaty [serves as **insurance against worst-case scenarios**.
For America, [NATO is a hedge against]{.mark} **another European
conflict** triggering **another [continentwide or worldwide
war]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} For NATO's other members, NATO is a security
guarantee backed by America. **[Without that guarantee, there's no
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as history has a way of reminding those
on the outside looking in, from Cold War Hungary to post-Cold War
Ukraine.

[Like all insurance policies, there are costs associated with
NATO.]{.underline} A recent study revealed that U.S. defense
expenditures earmarked for Europe amount to \$36 billion per year.
That's not a trivial amount of American taxpayers' money. [But consider
what [America gets]{.mark} in exchange for that insurance premium: [a
**hedge against another Argonne or Normandy**, a Europe **reinforced
against invasion**, and **economic benefits**]{.mark} that exponentially
exceed those premium costs.]{.underline}

[With Putin trying to reconstitute the Russian Empire and reverse the
settled outcomes of Cold War I, NATO is **proving its worth yet again**.
As]{.underline} Gen. James [Mattis puts it, "If we did not have NATO
today, we would need to create it."]{.underline}

#### The [NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline} (NIF) and [defense innovation accelerator]{.underline} (DIANA) are [good first steps]{.underline}, but [additional U.S. support]{.underline} is key to [actualize]{.underline} their benefits.

[[The]{.mark} Defense Innovation [Accelerator and]{.mark} NATO
Innovation [Fund]{.mark}]{.underline} announced at the NATO Summit [are
welcome developments]{.underline}, [but they [require **new
authorities** and **differentiated talent**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Swift tech]{.underline}nological [change has meant governments and the
military created new organizations and approaches to innovation and
rapid acquisition. Unfortunately, many do not have the necessary
authority, budget, or workforce to succeed]{.underline}, [meaning that
meaningful change and impact have been sacrificed for theater.
[For]{.mark}]{.underline} the newly announced Defense Innovation
Accelerator North Atlantic ([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- with
planned locations in Toronto and Cambridge, UK -- [[and
the]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO Innovation Fund
([[NIF]{.underline}]{.mark}) [to succeed, they [must address **authority
and budget concerns**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} then [bring in
the right personnel to lead and staff them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Authorities

[There are three key authorities that NATO must get right for DIANA and
NIF: reporting lines, patience]{.underline} (or willingness to accept
failure)[, and decision making.]{.underline}

\* First, [DIANA and NIF should operate independently with a direct line
into the most senior decision-makers]{.underline} (the Secretary
General, SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation --- SACT, etc).

\* Second, [they need to be allowed to fail. The most impactful defense
organizations]{.underline} (and indeed commercial organizations,
particularly in the startup world) [normalize taking big
bets]{.underline}, [with the knowledge that many will likely
fail]{.underline}, [and even the ones that succeed may take years to
realize their full impact.]{.underline}

\* Third and finally, [these new NATO bodies need to invest in or
provide support to initiatives and startups without requiring external
permission or consensus.]{.underline} At the same time, [[they]{.mark}
also [need a clear transition partner for promising capabilities to be
handed off to (**e.g. DARPA**]{.mark} **transitioning tech [to
the]{.mark} U.S. [D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense[**[)]{.mark}**, which can move from
development to deployment. [This will enable the Alliance to]{.mark}
more readily [**identify**, **develop**, and **deploy** e]{.mark}merging
and [d]{.mark}isruptive
[t]{.mark}ech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[[Similar efforts including]{.mark} the U.S. D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense['s [DARPA and
D]{.mark}]{.underline}efense [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nit[[,]{.mark} CIA's [In-Q-Tel, and]{.mark}
USAF's [S]{.mark}trategic [C]{.mark}apabilities
[O]{.mark}ffice]{.underline}, [[are effective]{.mark} because they exist
outside of traditional bureaucracies, leverage non-traditional talent
strategies, and have consistent budgets.]{.underline}

Budget

Allocating funding seems obvious, but too often limited forethought is
given to this issue. [To ensure success, organizational [funding must be
**significant**, **multi-year**, and **consistent**]{.mark} or include
inbuilt annual growth. A number of high-potential initiatives have
either been announced with no dedicated funding or have had sizable
funding gaps in subsequent years damaging their brand and relationships
with defense companies and startups alike. The NIF]{.underline} in
particular [will likely rely on the willingness of Alliance members to
make contributions beyond other NATO obligations. If so, **multi-year
commitments are crucial**]{.underline}, [as are success
metrics]{.underline}, [such as r]{.underline}eturn [o]{.underline}n
[i]{.underline}nvestment, [which are rarely used within NATO or national
government departments.]{.underline}

Talent

Finally, and most overlooked, is getting talent right. External talent
is crucial. It is not enough to simply construct new organizations
staffed in the traditional manner. [To realize their full potential,
[NATO must attract talent with startup and/or]{.mark}]{.underline}
venture capital ([[VC]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and pair them with top
subject-matter experts from R&D communities]{.underline}, [both
government]{.underline}, [and commercial. [This cannot be done with
NATO's current Byzantine]{.mark}, long, drawn-out hiring
[process]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which can last six months or even
longer]{.underline}, [and advantage insiders versus external
candidates.]{.underline} As such the Alliance must engage and attract
this talent. [The good news is [NATO has]{.mark} a number of potential
[examples to draw on for]{.mark} potential [hiring pathways.]{.mark} In
the U.S. [the D]{.mark}efense [D]{.mark}igital [S]{.mark}ervice
[hires]{.mark} design and technical [experts for]{.mark} one-to-two
"[tours of duty]{.mark}," using their skillsets and operate outside the
traditional civil service.]{.underline} In the UK, strategy and
technology professionals are seconded into the Ministry of Defence, the
Department of Trade, and intelligence organizations such as GCHQ, to
provide experience or skills that may not exist within the current civil
service workforce.

But providing pathways alone is not enough: attracting this talent to
apply and convincing them to join is just as important. This requires
identifying areas where they might work, including industry, academia,
and startups, and VC. At the same time, other steps are needed.
Upskilling existing NATO civilians -- among the international and
international military staff (IS and IMS) --- and Alliance service
members are needed to address this skill and understanding gap. To do
so, it is helpful to expose them to startup and VC environments.
Programs like Shift's Defense Ventures Program in the U.S. have
succeeded in building understanding between the Department of Defense's
civilian and military workforce and startups and VCs. They've done so by
bringing in high-performing defense personnel for eight-week immersions
with growing venture-backed startups or VC firms. This cultivates the
necessary connective tissue between startups, VCs, and the military.
NATO could readily follow a similar process by providing its highest
performers the opportunity to temporarily work alongside leading North
American and European startups and investors.

What's Next?

[Accelerating the development, deployment, and integration of emerging
and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [into the strategic and
tactical environments is at the core of future NATO operations. The
Alliance's move to build [DIANA and NIF]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[along
with incorporating]{.mark} the right [language into strategic documents
are **significant first steps**. But]{.mark} building [these
initiatives]{.mark} from scratch [will require **significant planning**
to establish the right **authorities**, **budget**, and **talent
environment**]{.mark} to enable these organizations to thrive. In order
to do so, [they need to build **outside of traditional NATO structures
and models**]{.mark} while creating a differentiated talent and
organizational culture.]{.underline}

#### [Specifically]{.underline}, increased [U.S. security cooperation with NATO]{.underline} is vital to NIF and DIANA effectiveness.

4\. [[The US should help NATO create **R&D centers** and]{.mark}
**defense [innovation hubs]{.mark}** [to harness emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies being developed by allies.]{.underline}

As was noted in the NATO 2030 Reflection Group, [[China is making
**rapid advancements**]{.mark} in telecom]{.underline}munications[,
space, cyberspace, and other new tech]{.underline}nologies [[with the
intent to be the world leader]{.mark} in AI by 2030 and the world's
leading global tech]{.underline}nological [superpower by
2049.]{.underline}96 [[In response, NATO]{.mark} issued its 2030 Agenda
that [seeks to **increase**]{.mark} **NATO [transatlantic innovation and
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological [[**edge** while
**preventing**]{.mark} **innovation [gaps]{.mark}** among
allies.]{.underline}97 Moreover, [the NATO Advisory Group
on]{.underline} Emerging and Disruptive Technologies ([EDT]{.underline})
[issued a]{.underline} 2020 [report citing pathways for NATO to become
an EDT-ready organization, recommending that NATO establish **a network
of innovation centers** \[or defense innovation hubs\] throughout NATO
with funding to match.]{.underline}98

[As a result, during the]{.underline} 14 Jun [2021 Brussels summit, NATO
issued a communique announcing the establishment of [a NATO Innovation
Fund]{.mark} to promote transatlantic startups [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
a Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark})[. Since DIANA [is intended to be NATO's
version of]{.mark} the US]{.underline} Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency ([[DARPA]{.underline}]{.mark})[[, **the US is
in**]{.mark} **a very good [position to promote]{.mark} transatlantic
[coordination]{.mark}** on **AI**, big-data processing, quantum-enabled
tech]{.underline}nologies[, autonomy, **biotech**]{.underline}nology[,
hypersonic weapons, and space.]{.underline}99 In addition, [[the US
could **support the Innovation Hub** by helping **pre-vet investors**
to]{.mark} ensure allied tech]{.underline}nology [would be
[protect]{.mark}ed [from **illicit transfers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}"100

Accordingly, [[the US should]{.mark} support NATO by [help]{.mark}ing
**[create R&D centers and]{.mark} defense innovation [hubs]{.mark}**
[that could **better harness emerging
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [to support NATO allies.
[These]{.mark} centers and hubs [would]{.mark} help **[accelerate
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology [[and **improve
coop**]{.mark}**eration [among]{.mark} NATO [allies and
partners]{.mark}** and would heavily rely on **partnerships** with
academia, researchers, industry, and start-ups.]{.underline}101
[[Linked]{.mark} to these NATO centers and hubs [would be
**universities**, **commercial**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end page 24\]
[[**sector**, and **allied**]{.mark} **countries'
[org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark}** that accelerate
tech]{.underline}nology [into the hands of the warfighter. For example,
[the US has several]{.mark} organizations, [such as **DARPA**,
**D**]{.mark}**efense [I]{.mark}nnovation [U]{.mark}nit**[, **AFWERX**,
**SPACEWERX**, **A**]{.mark}**rmy [F]{.mark}utures [C]{.mark}ommand**
[and **NavalX**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[that could **coordinate
closely**]{.mark} **with NATO centers and hubs** [to collaborate]{.mark}
on **similar problem sets and solutions**.]{.underline}

[Another important facet of these NATO centers and hubs is assessing how
the tech]{.underline}nology [will impact NATO's ability to **jointly
fight** in the future. [The]{.mark} NATO R&D [Center would need to be
**linked** to]{.mark} NATO's [A]{.mark}llied [C]{.mark}ommand
[T]{.mark}ransformation in]{.underline} Norfolk, [Virginia]{.underline},
[[to **identify**]{.mark} **potential [impacts]{.mark}** of the
tech]{.underline}nology [[on]{.mark} NATO's **[war-fighting]{.mark}
capabilities**.]{.underline} Accordingly, [[the US should **work
closely**]{.mark} **with NATO allies** [to ensure **integration** and
**interoperability**]{.mark} with these new
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}102

#### U.S. [expertise]{.underline} and [capabilities]{.underline} are key to quickly get required tech to the battlefield --- U.S. cooperation will [streamline]{.underline} NATO's innovation pipeline.

In a Feb. 26 Twitter post, Mykhailo Fedorov, [Ukraine's vice prime
minister]{.underline} and minister for digital transformation,
[asked]{.underline} the [SpaceX]{.underline} chief executive, Elon Musk,
[to provide Ukraine with Starlink terminals to enable satellite-based
communications. In less than 48 hours, Starlink user kits arrived in
Ukraine, immediately improving the command-and-control ability of
Ukraine's military.]{.underline}

[For those]{.underline} of us [who study the NATO acquisition process,
it is almost **impossible** to imagine the alliance identifying a
requirement and adopting a solution so quickly]{.underline}, [**no
matter how urgent the circumstances**. Among the many challenges would
be the alliance's elaborate, consensus-based governing
structure]{.underline}, [as well as the divergent interests and funding
mechanisms among the 30 member states. This is why]{.underline}, in
2016, [the International Board of Auditors concluded that NATO struggles
to provide commanders with required capabilities **on time** and
estimated that common-funded capabilities required an average of 16
years from development to delivery.]{.underline}

[The [complexity]{.mark} of modern weapons systems [and]{.mark} the
[challenges of interoperability mean]{.mark} that [any]{.mark} active
[engagement will lead to]{.mark} the [identification of new
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nical [[requirements]{.mark} for NATO. [The
alliance needs]{.mark} **the [processes and structures]{.mark} in
place** [to **rapidly** identify]{.mark} these requirements [and procure
solutions.]{.mark}]{.underline} This includes giving commanders the
authority to make decisions without the lengthy consensus-building
approach that may be reasonable, if slow, in peacetime but is not
effective during war.

First Steps

[[NATO **has**]{.mark} previously [sought to improve]{.mark} the
governance, speed, and efficiency of its capability-delivery process.
For example,]{.underline} in 2018 [NATO adopted a new governance model
for common-funded capabilities. It has undertaken efforts to enhance
collaboration between strategic commands]{.underline} (Allied Command
Operations in Mons, Belgium and Allied Command Transformation in
Norfolk, VA)[, called for the exploration of alternative acquisition
strategies to support tech]{.underline}nology [development, and created
the Office of the C]{.underline}hief [I]{.underline}nformation
[O]{.underline}fficer [to accelerate the delivery of computer and
info]{.underline}rmation [systems.]{.underline} Furthermore, in October
2021 [NATO launched [the]{.mark} first]{.underline} \$1.1 billion
**[[Innovation Fund]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
last month [announced the creation of the first ever **Defense
Innovation [Accelerator]{.mark}** for the North Atlantic to harness
cutting-edge tech]{.underline}nologies as part of the NATO 2030 agenda.

[These [are **valuable steps**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but they do
**not** address the **fundamental challenge** of rapidly acquiring
common capabilities.]{.mark} There are still many residual processes
where consensus-based control is inherently prioritized over speed,
flexibility, innovation, and the deployment of prototypes at the end of
their development phases.]{.underline}

[NATO leaders recognize the ongoing challenge.]{.underline} In a recent
speech to the North Atlantic Council, the supreme allied commander
transformation, Gen. Philippe Lavigne, stressed that one of his key
priorities is to ensure the timely delivery of new and critical
capabilities, adding that "we need to change the rules and make them
work for us, not against us." [But [NATO leaders **cannot** fix this
**alone** --- the]{.mark} alliance's **30 [member nations]{.mark}** are
the ones that will [**have to agree on the
solution**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Exploring alternatives and getting the
allies to agree on a solution will be difficult. It can happen on a
NATO-wide basis, or some subset of member nations can take on the
challenge and lead the effort, which may then be adopted by others.

What Works

[Access to adequate funding is a necessary starting point]{.underline},
[and NATO has a track record of funding common
capabilities.]{.underline} In 2021, NATO was implementing over 3,000
common-funded projects, worth approximately \$17 billion (of which the
United States funds about 22 percent). These include providing critical
technology that supports the planning and execution of all NATO air
operations, and the Air Situation Data Exchange that enhances
situational awareness at NATO's borders with partner nations, including
Ukraine.

[But the capability-fielding process is still subject to
delays]{.underline}, [which would be dangerous when addressing needs
identified during combat operations.]{.underline} To avoid this,
alliance members should commit to providing funds for a
rapid-acquisition organization on a preauthorized and discretionary
basis, in essence creating a bank account that can be drawn upon when
needed. Even if this were a credit line that members committed to,
rather than a standing pot of funds, it would limit setbacks caused by
the slow and political processes of identifying and appropriating
funding.

[Ensuring adequate funding is not the only answer. Commanders also need
the authority to streamline the identification of urgent needs and a
standing mechanism]{.underline}, not an ad hoc approach, [that can
provide the flexibility and authority to address them.]{.underline} This
exists for some alliance members on a national basis. The commander of
the Dutch Defense Materiel Organization's Computer Emergency Response
Team, for example, has a pre-authorized budget and the power to expedite
acquisitions of up to 500,000 euros for urgent cyber capabilities within
14 days. However, there is no NATO-wide approach.

[[offers]{.mark} a variety of [acquisition approaches]{.mark} that

the joint force commanders. There are also several

[organizations that have been stood up to address cross-service
challenges. This means that there are both joint department-wide and
service-level acquisition organizations procuring materiel to serve as
examples.]{.underline}

[Over time]{.underline}, [the [D]{.mark}]{.underline}epartment
[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}f [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense [[has]{.mark}
developed [processes to allow requirements identified on the battlefield
to be **quickly addressed**.]{.mark} Different parts of the department
have also embarked on different forms of organizational
innovation.]{.underline}

[[One example is the Air Force's R]{.mark}apid [C]{.mark}apabilities
[O]{.mark}ffice]{.underline}, [which was formed]{.underline} in 2003 [to
"expedite important]{.underline}, [often classified programs while
keeping them on budget."]{.underline} The office has a unique management
structure --- it reports to a board of directors that is chaired by the
undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment and includes
the most senior leaders of the Air Force and the under secretary of
defense for research and engineering. These senior leaders can both set
priorities for spending and work to find the necessary funding.
Furthermore, [acquisition experts at the Rapid Capabilities Office are
carefully selected to maintain a culture [where "**lean**, **agile**,
and **forward-looking** tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[development"
is possible.]{.underline}]{.mark} Along with the Air Force's new stealth
bomber, the B-21 Raider, the office oversees the X-37B Orbital Test
Vehicle, "an experimental test program to demonstrate technologies for a
reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform." The effectiveness of
the Rapid Capabilities Office is affirmed by the decision to put these
two extremely important programs there rather than within more
traditional Air Force acquisition organizations.

[Another concept comes from [the D]{.mark}]{.underline}efense
[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nit, [which
[was designed to]{.mark} work across the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [to [identify]{.mark} and
understand [critical]{.mark} national security [challenges that can be
solved with]{.mark} leading-edge [commercial
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [within 12 to 24 months. [The
D]{.mark}]{.underline}efense [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nit [[connects with]{.mark} non-traditional
suppliers in **[innovation hubs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [including
Silicon Valley]{.underline}, [and uses flexible acquisition models to
issue contracts in as little as 2 to 3 months.]{.underline} It then
publishes a catalog of commercial "solutions" ready for purchase from a
range of companies, many of whom are not traditional defense suppliers.
These include the Next Gen Explosive Ordnance Disposal Underwater
Response Vehicle, a remotely operated underwater vehicle that searches
for mines, and Hunt Forward, a set of tools for forward-deployed cyber
operations. Although implementation has not always been smooth, [the
D]{.underline}efense [I]{.underline}nnovation [U]{.underline}nit
[has]{.underline} nonetheless [provided battlefield commanders with **a
range of innovative solutions** that they can turn to.]{.underline}

[The R]{.underline}apid [C]{.underline}apabilities [O]{.underline}ffice
[empowers its leadership to finalize requirements and rapidly commit
funding, a crucial component of its success. The D]{.underline}efense
[I]{.underline}nnovation [U]{.underline}nit [focuses on creating a
pipeline of new tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline} And [these
organizations are not unique. There are others across the
services]{.underline}, [such as [**NAVALX**, the **Army Applications
Lab**, and **AFWERX**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that are aimed at
[adapt]{.mark}ing [innovations]{.mark} from both traditional and
non-traditional suppliers.]{.underline} The United Kingdom's Royal Air
Force has its own Rapid Capabilities Office, which has also shown
promise.

[These [**U.S. models** prove]{.mark} that [a bureaucracy]{.mark} as
[resistant to change]{.mark} as the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [[can still develop]{.mark} new
organizational [structures and processes.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Dutch
and British models show that attempts at organizational innovation are
not limited to the Pentagon. [NATO]{.underline} may choose to adapt one
of these or to develop its own unique approaches. The goal
[should]{.underline} be to [provide its commanders with the flexibility
and the authority to "validate requirements" ---]{.underline} that is,
[to formally approve what the warfighter needs to execute the fight ---
and to make resources available.]{.underline} The decision structure
could be a small rotating board of senior leaders, perhaps with time
limits for approving or rejecting requirements to force rapid decisions.

[[NATO]{.mark} also [needs]{.mark} a way [to connect with **industry
partners**]{.mark} **across the alliance**, capitalizing on innovations
from small businesses and startups using new and flexible contracting
mechanisms. [The alliance]{.mark} currently [lacks]{.mark} the [tools to
**rapidly adopt commercial
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[**[.]{.mark}** Two related policies
would help to enhance the ability of new tech]{.underline}nologies [to
connect with existing systems. To increase operational effectiveness,
[NATO should leverage **interoperability standards**]{.mark} that allow
different systems to operate seamlessly in a multi-domain environment. A
related approach would be to adopt **open systems architecture
approaches** for NATO weapons. This would provide design
info]{.underline}rmation [to companies for developing components [that
could work]{.mark} with existing systems [using a "**plug and play**"
approach.]{.mark} Both of these policies would build upon the
traditional NATO strength of developing standards while making these
standards relevant to innovative companies.]{.underline}

[All these process changes and organizational innovations will take
**effort** --- and the journey may be slowed by NATO's
consensus-building culture. Transformation takes time]{.underline}, [but
it only begins when there is a clear case for change. The scale and
scope of Russia's attack on Ukraine provides that case]{.underline},
[and the delivery of Starlink provides an example of what could be
possible if NATO had a more flexible approach to
acquisitions.]{.underline}

#### [Integrating]{.underline} the U.S. and NATO's [EDT innovation networks]{.underline} is key to [burden-sharing]{.underline} and [interoperability]{.underline} --- allies "say yes."

[The Defense Innovation Unit Experimental --- the Pentagon's signature
effort to engage commercial tech]{.underline}nology [startups ― is
**primed to go global**.]{.underline} In fact, [[DIUx could become a
**key platform**]{.mark} by which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and partners come together [to
address shared]{.mark} military [challenges]{.mark} ― if]{.underline}
its next managing director and [supporters in the Pentagon and Congress
are prepared to seize the moment.]{.underline}

Launched in 2015, [DIUx reflected a growing realization that the U.S.
military needs to more effectively leverage innovations developed in the
commercial tech]{.underline}nology [sector. Intended as a workaround to
a sclerotic defense acquisitions process, DIUx came to rely on an
obscure contracting authority to rapidly award prototype projects to
innovative companies ― a welcome change to the Pentagon business models
that never managed to align with the tech]{.underline}nology [industry's
far faster pace.]{.underline}

[By the end of the Obama admin]{.underline}istration, [DIUx]{.underline}
had [expanded beyond Silicon Valley to]{.underline} two other U.S.
innovation hubs --- [Boston and Austin.]{.underline}

Growth gave way to uncertainty following the 2016 presidential election,
with observers questioning whether the new team would support DIUx, and
Congress moving to restrict its access to funding. Since then, however,
DIUx has won the support of key stakeholders. Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis visited DIUx in mid-2017 and offered an unequivocal endorsement
of its mission to "accelerate commercial innovation to the war fighter."
Michael Griffin, the new undersecretary of defense for research and
engineering, has also expressed backing for DIUx, which falls within his
portfolio.

Congress has warmed somewhat to DIUx, though whether it will fund the
White House's requested plus-up remains uncertain. And DIUx has
demonstrated its ability to do more than fund prototypes ― transitioning
two projects into production contracts by the end of 2017.

[Engaging commercial tech]{.underline}nology [companies in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will ― and should ― remain the
primary focus of]{.underline} the next [DIUx]{.underline} managing
director[. However, with DIUx now on more solid political and
bureaucratic footing, [there is a unique opportunity to **broaden its
horizons**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Taking DIUx global could]{.mark} deliver multiple advantages. U.S.
commercial tech]{.underline}nology [companies do not hold a monopoly on
innovations relevant to solving vexing military challenges.]{.underline}
For example, Israel is a leading global provider of counter-drone
solutions. [A more internationally oriented DIUx could [improve]{.mark}
the [U.S.]{.mark} military's [access to
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [generated by companies located on the
soil [of]{.mark} its [allies and partners]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} simultaneously enable their governments to [more
effectively harvest U.S.]{.mark} commercial
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [for national defense
needs.]{.underline}

[Many U.S. [allies]{.mark} and partners [would **welcome the
opportunity**]{.mark} **to plug into DIUx**]{.underline}, [given the
diverse threats they confront ― from rising regional powers to terrorist
networks ― and constraints on the resources they can dedicate to
defense. At the political level, [cooperation]{.mark} around DIUx
[could]{.mark} help **[strengthen]{.mark} America's [alliances]{.mark}
and partnerships** at a time of uncertainty]{.underline},
[[while]{.mark} also **[bolstering]{.mark} future military
[interoperability]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Looking ahead, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will need
to identify **new and innovative ways to share the burden** with its
allies and partners to maintain its tech]{.underline}nological
[advantage.]{.underline} Although the Pentagon will see a budget
increase over the next two years, without legislative action, mandated
budget cuts will return in 2020. [[A more international]{.mark}ly
oriented [DIUx could]{.mark} help to **[spread the costs of
r]{.mark}**]{.underline}esearch **[[and
d]{.underline}]{.mark}**evelopment[[.]{.mark} Over the long
term]{.underline}, [[it could]{.mark} even [evolve into the
**cornerstone** of a **commercial innovation-oriented defense
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [**[network]{.mark}** spanning the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and
partners.]{.underline}

[[With traditional]{.mark} forms of **[security cooperation]{.mark}**
like large-scale r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment
[projects and f]{.underline}oreign [m]{.underline}ilitary
[s]{.underline}ales [[failing to keep pace]{.mark} with a rapidly
evolving threat environment, such [a network could]{.mark} enable the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and partners to
**[more effectively address shared]{.mark} national security
[challenges]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[DIUx has taken limited steps to engage U.S. allies and
partners.]{.underline} On the government side, these include welcoming a
United Kingdom liaison officer and, reportedly, plans to host an Indian
military representative. DIUx has also worked with a handful of foreign
commercial technology firms.

[Yet]{.underline}, beyond these initial steps, [significant opportunity
exists.]{.underline} To take DIUx global, the next managing director
could pursue multiple, mutually reinforcing options.

The easiest would be for personnel from DIUx and the military services
to conduct a series of roadshows to U.S. allies and partners. These
roadshows would serve a dual purpose: to showcase the portfolio of U.S.
firms that work with DIUx and to raise the awareness of DIUx among
overseas companies that typically do not consider the Pentagon as a
potential customer.

[A]{.underline} second [option would be to establish offices overseas in
order [to **embed DIUx in key ally**]{.mark} **and partner [innovation
hubs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These offices could take various forms ―
from a handful of DIUx personnel based in a U.S. embassy to a
bilaterally staffed organization funded in part by the host nation.

[DIUx offices overseas [could function as points of coordination]{.mark}
across U.S. alliances and partnerships]{.underline}, supporting efforts
like the "Five Eyes" Technical Cooperation Program, [but focus on
tech]{.underline}nologies [emerging out of the commercial sector in
addition to national lab]{.underline}oratorie[s.]{.underline} Some key
considerations for selecting a location would include a high density of
companies working on cutting-edge technologies with national security
relevance; commitment by ally and partner militaries to leverage
technology developed in the commercial sector; and willingness of ally
and partner governments to put up resources.

A third option would be to launch [dedicated [funds]{.mark} under DIUx
with financing contributed [from **both** the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[**[and]{.mark}** its [allies]{.mark} and partners]{.underline} to solve
joint challenges. Each fund would focus on awarding prototype projects
to companies with potential solutions to the challenge identified. This
option [[would]{.mark} allow the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and partners to **[share]{.mark}
defense [resources]{.mark}**[; provide **more revenue to**]{.mark}
**national security-relevant [startups]{.mark}** than the Pentagon could
on its own; [and **build interoperability up
front**.]{.mark}]{.underline} A clear area for such a fund would be
low-cost intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance coverage over a
vast maritime area ― a challenge that has long bedeviled the United
States and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region.

The next managing director of DIUx will have an unparalleled opportunity
to take it global. But she or he will need a mandate to do so ― ideally
from the secretary of defense. With that mandate, the next managing
director should quickly move to advance an ambitious agenda for
involving allies and partners more closely in the work of DIUx.
[[Announcing]{.mark} that [DIUx will open]{.mark} an office overseas
within a year [would]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [**[galvanize
ally]{.mark} and partner [interest]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 1AC --- Plan

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to strengthen defense innovation hubs and research and development in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and cybersecurity, including by substantially increasing its support for and participation in the NATO Innovation Fund and Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic. 

### 1AC --- Alliance Fragmentation Advantage

#### [Contention Two: Alliance Fragmentation]{.underline}

[To stay secure, [the transatlantic community must take on
e]{.mark}merging and [d]{.mark}isruptive
[t]{.mark}ech]{.underline}nologies [**[together]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Today's transatlantic security hinges on tech]{.underline}nology[. On
both sides of the Atlantic, our militaries, societies, economies, and
info]{.underline}rmation [systems require increasingly advanced
tech]{.underline}nologies [[to stay **better**, **faster**, and
**stronger** than]{.mark} our [adversaries and competitors. To retain
their advantage and address vulnerabilities, the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Europe
must **work in lockstep**]{.mark} to harness emerging and disruptive
tech]{.underline}nologies [for their collective defense. [The key is to
employ NATO and the]{.mark}]{.underline} European Union
([[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}) [**[in unison]{.mark}** for strategic
effect.]{.underline}

[NATO, the EU, and their member states have recognized the urgent need
to combine their complementary capabilities to contest Russia and
China]{.underline}, [especially in the tech]{.underline}nological
[domain.]{.underline} Just yesterday, [[NATO]{.mark} Secretary General
Stoltenberg [announced a]{.mark} new a [Defense Innovation
Initiative]{.mark} "to promote interoperability and boost transatlantic
cooperation on defense innovation" among allies -- 21 of which are
members of both NATO and the EU. NATO and the EU also share an
overlapping set of forces, capabilities, talent,
i]{.underline}ntellectual [p]{.underline}roperty[, and budgets for
defense investment and]{.underline} research and development
([R&D]{.underline})[. Under the 2016 Joint Declaration, [practical
NATO-EU coop]{.mark}eration [has been humming
along]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[despite **lingering political
obstacles**.]{.mark} Applying]{.underline} emerging and disruptive
technologies ([EDT]{.underline}), [such as]{.underline} artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.underline})[, autonomous systems, space
capabilities, hypersonics, quantum tech, and human
augmentation]{.underline}, [for defense has been a key focus area. This
has been underscored by]{.underline}, for example, [jointly supported
workshops at the]{.underline} European Center of Excellence for
Countering Hybrid Threats ([Hybrid COE]{.underline}) [and NATO-EU senior
military staff talks. As each organization has made EDT advances,
staff-level coordination and broad info]{.underline}rmation [sharing
have helped to better align their efforts. For instance, NATO's EDT
roadmap team, Innovation Hub, and Science and Tech]{.underline}nology
[Organization have engaged with the]{.underline} European Defense Agency
([EDA]{.underline})['s tech work.]{.underline}

[[**But staff-level coordination** can only bear **so much fruit** in
the absence of a **more robust political effort**.]{.mark} As strategic
and tech]{.underline}nological [competition with Russia and China has
intensified, [the stakes have risen **too high** to settle for
**incremental activities**. Avoiding the political battles required to
forge a **more meaningful joint NATO-EU approach**, nations have begun
exploring **other transatlantic forums**]{.mark} to address EDT issues.
The Canadian and French-led Global Partnership on AI, the U.S.-led AI
Partnership for Defense, and the European Commission's proposed
Transatlantic T]{.underline}ech and [T]{.underline}rade
[C]{.underline}ouncil [are a few examples. Each of these platforms is
useful in its own right, specifically for AI issues, and could benefit
from NATO and the EU joining to add their institutional weight. [The
risk]{.mark} with this approach]{.underline}, however, [[is **the rapid
fragmentation of transatlantic efforts**]{.mark} **on EDT**. If this
trend continues, [the result could be **a diffused smattering of
multilateral frameworks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [each focused on a
**particular tech issue** with a **different small group** of
countries.]{.underline}

[By opting for **outside platforms**, the transatlantic community misses
the point. [The **added value** of NATO and the EU is their ability to
**coordinate efforts**]{.mark} among **large groups** of like-minded
nations. [Both]{.mark} institutions [have]{.mark} a great deal of
[**experience** and **infrastructure**]{.mark} for doing so. [On]{.mark}
a [transformative]{.mark} set of [issues that require]{.mark}s [a
**comprehensive approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as the defense
application of EDT, [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and the EU have the
capacity to make **an enormous collective impact**.]{.mark} [Instead of
**scattering across alternative forums**,]{.mark} interested member
[nations must]{.mark} find ways to [drive their EDT work **through a new
NATO-EU mechanism**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Launching [an EU-NATO Strategic Dialogue on EDT could]{.underline} be an
important option to explore. Routine, higher-level meetings in this
format would [draw together senior representatives from each
institution]{.underline}, [as well as member states and the private
sector --- each of which plays vital roles in assessing vulnerabilities
and shaping requirements for EDT. [The scope should expand]{.mark}
beyond AI alone [to encompass]{.mark} consultations on the wider
security implications of EDT.]{.underline} Tentative [agenda items could
include **forging key principles for [tech governance]{.mark} around the
military applications of EDT**; addressing **[data-sharing]{.mark}
issues**; [coordinating]{.mark} **defense [R&D and investment]{.mark}
incentives**; [and]{.mark} establishing **more robust standards and
technical requirements** for EDT-enabled systems to enhance
[**interoperability**. This could]{.mark} potentially have positive
spillover in better aligning EDT aspects of the EU]{.underline}
Capability Development Plan ([CDP]{.underline})[, the]{.underline}
Coordinated Annual Review on Defense ([CARD]{.underline})[, and
the]{.underline} respective NATO Defense Planning Process
([NDPP]{.underline})[. It would also [create **synergies** for the EU to
leverage its **budgetary and legislative tools**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which NATO lacks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to]{.mark} more effectively
[reinforce the Alliance.]{.mark}]{.underline} Lastly, it could
strengthen the collective "annual review of vulnerabilities in alliance
critical infrastructure and technologies, including those stemming from
foreign ownership and influence", as the NATO Secretary General has
proposed.

The plethora of applications of emerging and disruptive technologies in
the defense realm is something that both militaries and policymakers are
dealing with on a daily basis. Developments are rapid but, at the same
time, require long-term engagement and vision from senior leaders. In
the end, EDT not only has implications for soldiers on the battlefield,
but also for political decision-makers. [In the near term, the COVID
crisis is occupying much of the bandwidth and institutional capacity
across NATO and the EU]{.underline}, [at the expense of accelerating the
dialogue in support of defense innovation. But [**urgent action** is
needed to]{.mark} grow the transatlantic community's fast-shrinking
tech]{.underline}nological [advantage in defense. It is paramount for
leaders to **diligently and [intensively focus]{.mark} on this
topic**]{.underline}, [[as opposed to simply **including it on the long
list of issues**]{.mark} for NATO or European Council
meetings.]{.underline} Through a structured EU-NATO Strategic Dialogue
on EDT, it could rightly become an integral part of the transatlantic
meeting cycle, not least to create a common understanding around future
defense implications. To this end, the NATO 2030 Reflection Group's
proposed NATO digital summit for governments and the private sector
should be extended to EU stakeholders and ultimately feed into this
strategic dialogue.

[To stay secure, the transatlantic community must take on
e]{.underline}merging and [d]{.underline}isruptive
[t]{.underline}echnologies [**together**. It should be at the forefront
of the [joint action]{.mark} by the EU and NATO, reflecting the pressing
need to act. This [is of **foundational importance** for maintaining the
Alliance's **strategic edge**, addressing **vulnerabilities**]{.mark} of
tech, [and defending]{.mark} the **[norms and values]{.mark}** it was
built to protect. As the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Europe renew their collective agenda at the dawn of the]{.underline} new
[Biden admin]{.underline}istration[, an EU-NATO Strategic Dialogue on
Defense Tech should be at the top of their list.]{.underline}

#### Insufficient U.S. support for [NIF]{.underline} and [DIANA]{.underline} is driving this fragmentation --- the plan is key to [supercharge]{.underline} NATO-EU cooperation on EDT.

2\. [Align EU-NATO work on defense innovation and find new formats of
engagement]{.underline}

[Both [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[EU have an interest in]{.mark}
investing in new and emerging defense tech]{.underline}nologies [and to
maintain [interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly in the
context of the U.S. tech]{.underline}nology [race with China. [The
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [through
AUKUS]{.underline}, [[has established a]{.mark}n innovation [partnership
with just]{.mark} one European ally, [the UK]{.mark} (for
now)[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Meanwhile, [[NATO]{.mark} has [launched
a]{.mark} new defense innovation [fund and]{.mark}]{.underline} a
defense innovation accelerator ([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark})[. The
UK]{.underline}, which post-Brexit has given itself the guidance to
'Think NATO,'\[7\] [was a supporter of the Fund, **[but the
U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[**and
France are not members**.]{.underline}]{.mark} At the same time,
[[France]{.mark} often [argues]{.mark} that [the EU should be in the
lead]{.mark} on emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [[and is pushing
for]{.mark} the creation of [a]{.mark}n Innovation Defense [Hub within
the E]{.mark}]{.underline}uropean [[D]{.underline}]{.mark}efense
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}gency[[. These]{.mark} defense innovation
[efforts **pursued in parallel by both
org**]{.mark}**anization[s]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} already [leading
officials to **complain** about]{.mark} NATO [duplicating]{.mark} the EU
and vice versa[. Both]{.mark} Americans and Europeans [should try to
**prevent**]{.mark} **a [rehashing]{.mark} of [this unproductive talking
point]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Parallel to the EU]{.mark} branching out into 'traditional' security,
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [broadening its]{.underline} own
[understanding of security to include newer domains]{.underline} such as
economic security, disruptive technologies, and disinformation.\[8\]
This development [[provides]{.mark} **clear [opportunities for
coop]{.mark}eration** between the two organizations]{.underline}, [[but
also]{.mark} presents [risks of **conflict** and **tension**.]{.mark}
NATO-EU cooperation today remains largely process-driven.
Inter-institutional exchanges are often focused on 'deconflicting'
rather than building genuine synergies]{.underline},\[9\] [and the
relationship suffers from long-standing political conflict between
Turkey and Cyprus and from newer tensions between the UK and France.
[The concurrent]{.mark} NATO [Strategic Concept and]{.mark} EU Strategic
[Compass]{.mark} processes [are an opportunity for the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark}
the [EU to **work together to improve NATO-EU coop**]{.mark}**eration
[on innovation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The next NATO-EU joint
declaration, which is scheduled to be published soon, could help by
acknowledging a new division of labor between the two institutions.

For instance, [[it would make sense]{.mark} for the two organizations
[to cooperate on **investment screening**, **research protection**,
and]{.mark} **initiatives to facilitate
[info]{.mark}**]{.underline}rmation[**[-sharing]{.mark} on dual-use
export and import controls** of critical

**Mundell 22** --- Ian Mundell, Innovation Reporter at
*Science\|Business*---a network of universities, companies, and research
and policy organisations promoting innovation, 2022 ("The Ecosystem: in
Europe, defence innovation is the new black," *Science\|Business*, June
7^th^, Available Online at

Accessed 07-03-2022)

[Suddenly]{.underline}, [it seems]{.underline}, [everyone cares about
Europe's defence innovation ecosystem. NATO is setting up]{.underline}
the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or
[DIANA]{.underline}, [with a significant presence in Europe. The
European Commission is working on the]{.underline} EU Defence Innovation
Scheme, [EUDIS. And]{.underline} last month, [Amazon Web Services
announced it is setting up a private defence accelerator in the
UK.]{.underline}

[But details of the [DIANA and EUDIS]{.mark} initiatives [have been
**slow**]{.mark} to emerge, [leading to]{.mark} concerns that [**gaps**
and **barriers**]{.mark} **to innovation** remain to be
addressed.]{.underline} EUDIS in particular leaves a lot of questions
unanswered.

["[It's **a step in the right direction**, but]{.mark} whether it is
enough is deeply debatable," said]{.underline} Nicholas [Nelson, senior
fellow with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center
for European Policy Analysis]{.underline} in Washington DC[. "And this
will not be figured out in the next year or two. It [will take **five or
ten years**]{.mark} to see what the impact is."]{.underline}

[This sentiment is echoed by]{.underline} Alain [De Neve, a specialist
in defence innovation at Belgium's Royal Higher Institute for Defence.
"EUDIS is a timely initiative for the EU member states, although from a
macro-strategic point of view **[there is still a long way to
go]{.mark}** for Europeans if they want [to build a competitive research
ecosystem]{.mark} on a more global scale," he said.]{.underline}

Detecting hidden threats

[EUDIS is intended to bring together all relevant EU initiatives that
support defence innovation and entrepreneurship.]{.underline} This
includes innovation-focused calls for proposals issued through the
European Defence Fund (EDF), such as a planned technological challenge
to test and mature technologies for hidden-threats detection, and a
four-year partnership for the development of defence medical counter
measures against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The Commission also plans a number of initiatives intended to structure
the European defence ecosystem. Some of these are still frustratingly
vague. There is to be a dual-use incubator to allow better spin-in and
spin-out between the civil and defence sectors, and to spur
technological maturation and adaptation. This project was first floated
in the EU's 2021 Action plan on synergies between civil, defence and
space industries, which suggested it might be a virtual network based on
close collaboration between the Commission, the European Innovation
Council and the European Defence Agency.

At that stage, the incubator's potential activities included screening
EU-funded research for results relevant to defence and proposing them
for follow-up funding or user uptake. It was also to support new
technologies with dual-use potential coming from start-ups, SMEs, and
research and technology organisations. But these details and partners
have vanished from the latest description of the incubator, and the
Commission says it has nothing more to add while preparations are
on-going.

Detail is also still lacking on the cross-border innovation networks
listed as part of the EUDIS toolbox. These are intended to test the
relevance of technologies from the civil sector in defence-specific
environments. Then there will be other supporting measures for
innovative companies, such as matchmaking with primes, investors and end
users; business coaching; and the organisation of hackathons.

Defence Equity Facility

[The most concrete EUDIS initiative unveiled so far is the Defence
Equity Facility]{.underline}, [which is intended to address the lack of
risk capital in the EU for start-ups and small and mid-size companies
developing innovative defence tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}
The Commission will put €100 million into the facility over the next
five years, which is expected to be augmented by the European Investment
Fund and private investors to reach a total of €500 million.

"Enabling a better access to equity funding for innovative defence SMEs
and mid-caps would support their growth and finally benefit to the
innovativeness of the European defence technological and industrial
base," the Commission says in the latest EDF work programme, released on
25 May. "It will also reduce their exposure to non-EU investors and
benefit to the EU's strategic autonomy." The creation of the facility is
also intended to send a positive message to private investors that the
EU's defence sector is an attractive proposition.

[Nelson thinks the Defence Equity Facility is a **good
start**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} again **[a lot of important
detail is still missing]{.underline}**, [such as how and on what terms
the equity will be awarded.]{.underline} An enlightened choice would be
to make non-dilutive investments, the approach used by Air Force
Ventures in the US. "It is not taking equity, it is investing alongside
private capital investors, because it views this as good for the
ecosystem," Nelson said.

But [Nelson is also concerned that the facility potentially appears open
to all-comers]{.underline}, [rather than targeting start-ups and
companies with a civilian background moving into defence. If confirmed,
this will **limit its impact**.]{.underline}

For example, a seed round for a defence start-up might typically be
around €2 million, with €500,000 from the Commission contribution
required to lead the round. So, if the facility is focused exclusively
on this early stage investment it might support 40 companies a year,
which is modest enough. But if the facility gets involved in series A
and B rounds, which might run to €5-7 million per round, its reach will
be severely constrained. "To be honest, it needs to have another zero on
the end per annum to have a catalysing effect," said Nelson.

Gundbert [Scherf, co-founder and managing director of Helsing, a German
start-up active in a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence
[and software-defined defence, thinks this **lack of focus** is already
holding back EDF. "Only **8%** of EDF funds to date have been allocated
to disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies[. Consortiums primarily feature
traditional primes instead of deep tech disruptors]{.underline}, [who
actually invest their own money into de-risking tech and hiring the
right talent," he said. "In reality we need to spend the majority of
funds on disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [and empower new defence
companies that are developing them. Only this will deliver the
innovation, disruption, speed, and quality we need."]{.underline}

Dual-use technologies

[Another aspect of [EUDIS]{.mark} that [is unclear]{.mark} is [how it
will line up with]{.mark} **NATO's [DIANA]{.mark} initiative**. This was
launched]{.underline} in April, [with a mission to bring industry,
start-ups and academia together to research new dual-use
tech]{.underline}nologies[. Initially it will run a network of more than
10 accelerator sites and over 50 test centres in innovation hubs across
NATO alliance countries. The UK and Estonia will host DIANA's European
accelerators.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [a complementary NATO Innovation
Fund will invest €1 billion in early stage start-ups and other deep tech
funds]{.underline}, over an unspecified period of time[.]{.underline}

[[The Commission says]{.mark} that [it will work with NATO]{.mark}
"[to]{.mark} ensure that we can [develop synergies]{.mark} when and
where possible". De Neve thinks [**this may not be so straightforward**.
"It would be difficult to imagine that these two]{.mark} cooperation
frameworks [could operate without any exchange]{.mark} between them," he
said. "[**However**,]{.mark} and [to the extent that **DIANA assumes the
contribution of the US**]{.mark}, [it seems difficult to imagine
interactions]{.mark} between these two institutions [that do not **clash
with the restrictive measures put in place by the US in terms of
transfer of sensitive
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[[."]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Beyond building collective capacity to operate more seamlessly in
response to today's crises, [the U.S. must]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[think more closely about [build]{.mark}ing [alliance innovation
ecosystems]{.mark} for the future. With China set to overtake the U.S.
in r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment
[spending]{.underline} --- it already spends more on R&D than Japan,
Germany, and South Korea combined --- [[the U.S. and]{.mark} its
[allies]{.mark} will [need to treat]{.mark} defense [innovation as a
**combined task**.]{.mark} Rising [techno-nationalism and]{.mark} the
[lack of allied]{.mark} innovation [networks will make this difficult
absent **intentional policy leadership**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Looking
forward, [[Washington should]{.mark} **further [expand]{.mark} new

[[rather than treating allies as an **add-on**]{.mark} to existing

Meeting the Challenge: Digital Technologies

[Due to the nature of the challenges that China poses to it, NATO's
priority should be to meet them at home. However, [in countering]{.mark}
the **economic**, **tech**]{.underline}nological[, and **security**
challenges that [China]{.mark} poses, [collaboration with **partner
countries** in the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} that are like-minded and have
valuable experience in countering Beijing's assertiveness [is]{.mark}
equally [important.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, as Secretary
General Stoltenberg has stated, NATO is unlikely to face the China
challenge by being physically present in the South China Sea or
elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region.25 to resource constraints and
other concerns, this remains unlikely in the near future. [[NATO can
best meet the tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[challenge]{.mark}
that [China poses through]{.mark} greater collaboration and
[coordination with]{.mark} regard to the digital space and
[e]{.mark}]{.underline}merging and [[d]{.underline}]{.mark}isruptive
[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}echnologies[[. While current]{.mark} NATO
[activity]{.mark} in EDTs]{.underline}, as well as in data management
and governance, [[is **a step in the right direction**]{.mark} to
protect domestic resilience and to enhance innovation capacities, there
are [further options]{.mark} to [strengthen the]{.mark} alliance's
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [[edge]{.mark} at home and [with
partners]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}

**[Expand NATO collaboration on EDTs to partners in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**

[[NATO is]{.mark} in the process of [developing]{.mark} the mechanisms,
funding, and strategy behind [DIANA and the N]{.mark}]{.underline}ATO
[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation [[f]{.underline}]{.mark}und, the
former aimed at launching in 2023 and the latter potentially totaling to
\$1 billion. [DIANA aims to be NATO's version of]{.underline} the United
States' [D]{.underline}efense [A]{.underline}dvanced
[R]{.underline}esearch [P]{.underline}rojects [A]{.underline}gency [and
to bring together transatlantic efforts on critical
tech]{.underline}nologies[, working with industry and academia on AI,
big-data processing, quantum-enabled tech]{.underline}nologies[,
autonomy, biotech]{.underline}nology[, hypersonic weapons, and
space.]{.underline} Subsequently, [the Innovation Fund will seek
initially to invest \$81]{.underline}.2 [million per year in
transatlantic startups.]{.underline} Importantly, [it will work with
pre-vetted investors to ensure that "the tech]{.underline}nology [will
be protected from illicit transfers."]{.underline}26

[While much is still left to be decided on both these efforts, [there
are clear areas for **practical coop**]{.mark}**eration** [with partners
in the Indo-Pacific; for example, with]{.mark} regard to the
Australia-United Kingdom-United States (**[AUKUS]{.mark}**) security
pact [and **the Quad**]{.mark}]{.underline}rilateral Security Dialogue
[joining Australia, India, Japan, and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[.]{.underline}

First, AUKUS aims to promote cooperation beyond the initially agreed
nuclear-powered-submarine program. The agreement seeks to foster "deeper
integration of security and defense-related science, technology,
industrial bases and supply chains."27 Trilateral collaboration will
focus on cyber capabilities, AI, quantum technologies, and additional
undersea capabilities.

Following the first in-person leaders' summit of the Quad in September
2021, leaders of the four countries put forth an initiative to partner
on emerging technologies, space, and cybersecurity, and to cultivate
next-generation talent.28 Exact timelines for these initiatives are
still unclear. With regard to the latter, the Quad Fellowship will
provide 100 scholarships per year for students in science, technology
engineering, and mathematics from the four countries to study in the
United States. Ultimately, the program will seek to develop a network of
science and technology experts among the Quad countries. On critical and
emerging technologies, the countries will work together to publish a
statement of principles that touches on the design, development,
governance, and use of technology; to establish a technical standards
contact group; to launch a semiconductor supply-chain initiative; to
support 5G deployment and diversification; and to monitor advances in
biotechnologies.29 The Quad countries will also collaborate on
cybersecurity issues and establish a space-related working group that
shares climate change-related satellite data, enables capacity-building
in space-related domains in other Indo-Pacific countries, and consults
on norms and guidelines.

[While the overlap is not exact, there are significant areas for
cooperation between NATO, AUKUS, and Quad countries. [Australia and
Japan are already NATO partner countries]{.mark} and cooperate
politically with the alliance on a variety of levels from parliaments to
heads of state, ministries of foreign affairs and
defense.]{.underline}30 **\[\[\[\*\*\*Start Footnote 30\*\*\*\]**
[NATO's]{.underline} "[global partners]{.underline}," such as Australia
and Japan, [are countries with whom the alliance engages politically and
have access to the same activities that NATO]{.underline} Individual
Partnership Cooperation Programme [countries receive. They work with
NATO on areas of common interest, such as cyber defence,
counterterrorism, non-prolif]{.underline}eration[, and resilience. In
some cases, NATO and its global partners cooperate through NATO military
operations or through defence capacity, training, and educational
programmes.]{.underline} See NATO, Relations with partners across the
globe, August 25, 2021. **\[\[\[\*\*\*End Footnote 30\*\*\*\]\]\]**
[[Bringing partner countries into]{.mark} NATO's programing on [EDTs
would not only increase]{.mark} the alliance's [innovative capacities
but also]{.mark} allow it to [align]{.mark} itself [with]{.mark} the
[priorities]{.mark} of partners [in the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} to a
greater extent.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} potential [stumbling block]{.mark} for such cooperation
[might be]{.mark} the recent [tensions between the EU]{.mark} (and
therefore some NATO members) [and]{.mark} the [AUKUS]{.mark} countries.
Transatlantic relations soured following the announcement of the
establishment of the security pact and the related cancellation of the
submarine deal worth \$90 billion between Australia and France. The
announcement of AUKUS also coincided with the publication of the EU's
Indo-Pacific strategy]{.underline}, [which highlights the ambition to
work with the Quad in the region.]{.underline}31 [There is thus a
potential risk that EU members that are also [NATO members]{.mark},
**[in particular France]{.mark}**, [may prioritize]{.mark}
tech]{.underline}nological [[development within]{.mark} an [EU rather
than NATO]{.mark} context.]{.underline}

[This risk may be overstated, however. The EU's Indo-Pacific strategy
focuses primarily on digital governance and partnerships]{.underline}:
the development of shared technological standards, alone and together in
coordination with like-minded partners, for areas such enhancing
governance around AI based on democratic principles and fundamental
rights. [The EU's practical engagement with its Indo-Pacific partners on
the development of EDTs is still limited. It only has agreements on
areas of practical cooperation and development with a select few
countries in the Indo-Pacific, such as India and Japan with which it has
agreed to deepen cooperation on 6G, standardization, AI, blockchain, and
quantum and other tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

Second, [the security and defense section of the EU's Indo-Pacific
strategy does not make any mention of cooperation with like-minded
countries in the Indo-Pacific on EDTs. The strategy's main
focus]{.underline} here [is on cooperation on disinformation, maritime
security, outer space, cybersecurity, peacekeeping, counterterrorism,
and arms control. As the EU's focus on EDTs is primarily on **standard
setting**, **governance**, **ethics**, and **civilian applications**,
there may be an opportunity to **collaborate** and **share the burden**
with NATO. [NATO could **work alongside the EU**]{.mark} to ensure
standards are set for EDTs in the defense and civilian realms [while
**taking the lead** on]{.mark} the development and adoption of
[**defense-related** EDTs.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Establish NATO standards on data governance together with partners in
the Indo-Pacific

In 2017, the commander of NATO's Allied Command for Transformation,
General Denis Mercier, stated that "data is now a main strategic
resource. Processes for collecting, sharing, exploiting and distributing
data are the main drivers to adapting organizations."32 This remains
true with regard to the military and civilian, public and private
sectors. If shared policies on data governance promote interoperability,
help to establish rules and norms, and secure data, then divergent
policies could have the opposite effect. If NATO aims to remain
competitive and to increase its innovation strengths in EDTs and digital
technologies, digital policy coordination should be an area of
discussion within the alliance.

In October 2021, NATO defense ministers agreed to the alliance's
first-ever strategy for AI, which includes an ambition to agree on
standards of data collection and use for AI. NATO also has standards and
processes related to big data produced by the alliance.33 However, if
NATO members and partner countries seek to cooperate and collaborate on
the development and adoption of emerging technologies and data-driven
innovation, then addressing data governance and trusted cross-border
data flows between allies and across partners is of importance. To date,
some NATO members are aligned through membership of the EU and its
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and through the European Data
Governance Act (subject to final approval by the European Parliament and
Council of the EU this year).34 However, other allies, such as the
United States, have taken different approaches to data governance and it
remains to be seen whether the new EU-US Trade and Technology Council
can find solutions for transatlantic cooperation in this area.35

Last, [if collaboration between the innovative economies of NATO allies
and their partners in the Indo-Pacific is a goal, then greater
like-mindedness and alignment of data-governance norms should be an area
of consideration in the future within the alliance and with countries
like Australia, India, and Japan.]{.underline}

[This undoubtedly falls outside of the realm of NATO's traditional area
of competence and more clearly a suitable role for the European
Commission. This is not an obstacle: NATO has agreed already to work
with the EU in areas where the latter has experience and
competence.]{.underline} Furthermore, [the EU is an active player in
bilateral discussions between member states and non-EU countries about
data sharing and data governance. Its Indo-Pacific strategy already
envisions a greater role for the EU in the region in areas of digital
governance through Digital Partnership Agreements with Japan, Singapore,
and South Korea.]{.underline} The EU has already deepened its digital
partnership with India in 2021 which seeks to promote 5G in line with
global strategies and develop joint visions for next generations of
information and communications technology, to promote digital
cooperation between private sectors in each country, and to ensure that
data regulation in India and the EU align with each other. Similarly,
the EU and Japan created the world's largest area of safe data flows in
2019 when the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision on Japan
for a data-sharing agreement.36

Conclusion

[While countering the challenges that China poses to NATO will not be
easy, the greatest challenge will be to find agreement and unity between
allies on how to address their shared concerns about China's rise. The
limitations on NATO's resources]{.underline}, particularly due to the
requirements of allies to focus on collective security and defense at
home, [will make it difficult for the alliance to counter the China
challenge in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} Though a show of commitment
by sending military assets to the region and NATO's partners there is
important, addressing the challenges that China poses to the alliance
and its partners alike should be done in more varied ways.

[[NATO should]{.mark} focus on [expand]{.mark}ing its current work in
the digital sphere to [coop]{.mark}eration and collaboration
[with]{.mark} partner countries in [the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} in order
[to build a strong ecosystem]{.mark} of like-minded digital actors. [By
cooperating on EDTs]{.mark} and sharing data [to ensure]{.mark} that the
[private and public sectors]{.mark} in allied and partner countries [as
well as institutions like the EU remain competitive, NATO]{.mark} and
like-minded countries [can take steps toward **bolstering**]{.mark}
**their [defense and security capabilities]{.mark}** [and **preparing
for competition as well as**]{.mark} **for
[conflict]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[American foreign policy]{.underline} after---indeed,
[during]{.underline}---[the Russo-Ukrainian War should promptly head to
the world's most decisive region: **Asia**. This will require that
American foreign and defense policy **genuinely put Asia first**---in
our **military investments**, in our allocation of **political capital**
and **resources**, and in our leaders' **attention**.]{.underline}

[Nothing that has happened since Russia's]{.underline} abominable
[invasion of Ukraine has changed a set of facts: Asia is the world's
largest market area]{.underline}, [and it is growing in global share.
Located in the middle of Asia is China which]{.underline}, [alongside
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [is one of the world's two
superpowers. [China's]{.mark} behavior has become [**increasingly
aggressive** and]{.mark} domineering and appears [oriented toward
establishing]{.mark} Beijing's [**hegemony over Asia**.]{.mark} If
Beijing achieves this goal, the resulting consequences for American life
will be **dire**.]{.underline}

[[Preventing]{.mark} China from establishing [this]{.mark} hegemony over
Asia [must]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[be the priority]{.mark} of
U.S. foreign policy---even in the face of what is happening in
Europe.]{.underline} The simple fact is that **[[Asia is more important
than Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and China is a **much greater
threat**]{.mark} than Russia.]{.underline} By way of comparison, [Asia's
economy is roughly twice as large as Europe's today---but within twenty
years it will likely be multiple times greater. China]{.underline}, in
the meantime, [has a GDP roughly **an order of magnitude** larger than
Russia's.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} current [trends continue, China appears **on a trajectory
to achieve its hegemonic ambitions**.]{.mark} Beijing has been building
a military distinctly not limited to territorial defense.]{.underline}
Rather, [[it will be capable of]{.mark} enabling Beijing's pursuit of
much larger and ambitious goals---first by **[ingesting
Taiwan]{.mark}**, [but **not ending there**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Indeed, [amidst the furor over the war in Ukraine, Beijing announced yet
again that it would increase its defense spending by 7 percent this
year.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [despite much talk, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has neglected its military
position in Asia]{.underline}, [while many of its allies---especially
Japan and Taiwan---have been laggard in maintaining their defenses. As a
result]{.underline}, [the military balance in Asia has continued to
shift markedly against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
our allies. In blunt terms, [we are]{.mark} now **[rapidly
approaching]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[if not already
in]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[**the window of opportunity** where China
might]{.mark} well decide to [**attack Taiwan**---**and we might
lose**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Avoiding this outcome must be the **top**]{.underline}, [**overriding
priority** for [U.S. policy]{.mark}. This does not mean Europe is
unimportant or that we should neglect or abandon it. We
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} actively support Ukraine with weapons and
other forms of support while [[remain]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[firmly
committed to NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, [albeit with our contributions
being more focused and narrow in scale. [But]{.mark} it does mean [Asia
must be our **priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and genuinely
so]{.underline}, [not just rhetorically as has so often been the case in
the past.]{.underline}

Because of these factors, [shifting our focus to Asia would make sense
regardless of how Russia's invasion of Ukraine fared. But]{.underline},
if anything, [the war in Ukraine and the reaction to it has made it even
more palatable for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to turn
to Asia. Moscow]{.underline}, [while still menacing and
dangerous]{.underline}, [has vividly demonstrated that its power is less
formidable than many of us had feared. Russia is very likely to try to
recover its strength]{.underline}, [but the losses of war and the impact
of sanctions are likely to make that process slow and difficult. At the
same time, Europe has stood up, announcing major increases in defense
spending, supporting Ukraine's own self-defense, and demonstrating an
unprecedented degree of cohesion in applying sanctions and other forms
of pressure on Russia.]{.underline}

[The result is that Moscow appears **less of a threat** than many of us
had supposed]{.underline}, [while Europeans are doing more to shoulder
their own defense.]{.underline} If anything, [this should make the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[more]{.underline}**, **[not
less]{.underline}**, [**ready to focus on Asia**.]{.underline} Indeed,
[in these circumstances, it is]{.underline} actually [hard to understand
the logic of increasing America's focus on Europe. Why would we double
down in Europe at the expense of Asia when there is less of a threat
from Russia and more European self-help---all while the danger in the
primary theater only increases?]{.underline}

[Yet many in the foreign policy and political elite seem to view the
Russo-Ukrainian War as an opportunity precisely to double down in
Europe.]{.underline} Even more, for some, it is a chance to try to turn
the foreign policy clock back to the globe-spanning liberal imperialism
of two decades ago.

[Washington must resist this temptation like the plague. The
breathtakingly hubristic foreign policies of the 2000s were unwise even
in the period of unipolarity]{.underline}, as we have found to our
chagrin. As American leaders sermonized on an end to evil, China rose at
our expense; our military expeditions in the Middle East ended in
frustration, when not failure; and we lost our military edge and many of
our economic advantages. [But such policies would be even more
extraordinarily ill-advised when [we are]{.mark} now [locked in a
**strategic rivalry** with a superpower China]{.mark} that is [**far
more powerful** than the **USSR**, **Germany**, or **Japan** ever were.
We]{.mark} simply [**do not have** the preponderance of power to waste
our resources]{.mark} anymore.]{.underline}

[[Time]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[to focus on]{.mark} the region and
the contest that really matters: [the effort to deny China's
dominance]{.mark} of Asia. [We are already]{.mark} well [behind]{.mark}
in that struggle]{.underline}, [[and **every day we neglect to
increase**]{.mark} **our [focus]{.mark}** [further increases the chances
of **crisis**, **war**, and **defeat**]{.mark}---with grievous
consequences for all Americans.]{.underline}

#### Strengthening allied power to counter China is the only way to prevent [great power war]{.underline} --- accommodation makes it [inevitable]{.underline}.

The Clash of Systems

[[The history of international order building is]{.mark} one of
**[savage competition between clashing systems]{.mark}**, not of
harmonious cooperation. In the best of times, that competition took the
form of a cold war]{.underline}, [with each side jockeying for advantage
and probing each other with every measure short of military force. [In
many cases]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [the [competition]{.mark}
eventually [**boiled over into a shooting war** and ended with one side
crushing the other.]{.mark} The victorious order then ruled until it was
destroyed by a new competitor---or until it simply crumbled without an
external threat to hold it together.]{.underline}

[Today, a growing number of policymakers and pundits are calling for a
new concert of powers to sort out the world's problems and divide the
globe into spheres of influence. But [the idea of an inclusive
order]{.mark} in which no one power's vision prevails [is a
**fantasy**]{.mark} that can exist only in the imaginations of
world-government idealists and academic theorists. **[There are only two
orders]{.mark}** under construction right now[---a **Chinese**-led one
and a **U.S.**-led one]{.mark}---and the contest between the two is
rapidly becoming a clash between autocracy and democracy]{.underline},
[as both countries define themselves against each other and try to
infuse their respective coalitions with ideological purpose. China is
positioning itself as the world's defender of hierarchy and tradition
against a decadent and disorderly West; the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is belatedly summoning a new alliance to check
Chinese power and make the world safe for democracy.]{.underline}

[[This clash]{.mark} of systems [will define the twenty-first
century]{.mark} and divide the world. China will view the emerging
democratic order as a containment strategy designed to strangle its
economy and topple its regime. In response, it will seek to protect
itself by asserting greater military control over its vital sea-lanes,
carving out exclusive economic zones for its firms, and propping up
autocratic allies as it sows chaos in democracies. The upsurge of
Chinese repression and aggression]{.underline}, in turn, [will further
impel the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies to
shun Beijing and build a democratic order.]{.underline} For a tiny
glimpse of what this vicious cycle might look like, consider what
happened in March 2021, when Canada, the United Kingdom, the United
States, and the EU sanctioned four Chinese officials for human rights
abuses in Xinjiang. The sanctions amounted to a slap on the wrist, but
Beijing interpreted them as an assault on its sovereignty and unleashed
a diplomatic tirade and a slew of economic sanctions. The EU returned
fire by freezing its proposed EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on
Investment.

[In the coming years, [the trade and tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
[[wars]{.mark} between China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates that began during the Trump administration [[will
**rage on** as both sides try to expand their]{.mark} respective
[spheres.]{.mark} Other countries will find it increasingly difficult to
hedge their bets by maintaining links to both blocs.]{.underline}
Instead, [[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will **push their partners to pick
sides**]{.mark}, compelling them to reroute their supply chains and
adopt wholesale the ecosystem of tech]{.underline}nologies [and
standards of one side's order.]{.underline} The Internet will be split
in two. When people journey from one order to the other---if they can
even get a visa---they will enter a different digital realm. Their
phones won't work, nor will their favorite websites, their email
accounts, or their precious social media apps. Political warfare between
the two systems will intensify, as each tries to undermine the domestic
legitimacy and international appeal of its competitor. East Asian
sea-lanes will grow clogged with warships, and rival forces will
experience frequent close encounters.

[[The standoff will end **only** when one side **defeats** or
**exhausts** the other.]{.mark} As of now, [the smart money is on the
U.S.]{.mark} side]{.underline}, [which has far more wealth and military
assets than China does and better prospects for future growth. By the
early]{.underline} 20[30s, Xi]{.underline}, an obese smoker with a
stressful job, [will be in his 80s]{.underline}, [if he is still alive.
China's demographic crisis will be kicking into high gear]{.underline},
[with the country projected to lose roughly 70 million working-age
adults and gain 130 million senior citizens between now and then.
Hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas Chinese loans will be
due]{.underline}, [and many of China's foreign partners won't be able to
pay them back. It is hard to see how a country facing so many challenges
could long sustain its own international order]{.underline}, [especially
in the face of determined opposition from the world's wealthiest
countries.]{.underline}

[[Yet it is]{.mark} also **[far from guaranteed]{.mark}** that the
U.S.-led democratic order will hold together.]{.underline} The United
States could suffer a constitutional crisis in the 2024 presidential
election and collapse into civil strife. Even if that doesn't happen,
the United States and its allies might be rent by their own divides. The
democratic world is suffering its greatest crisis of confidence and
unity since the 1930s. Nationalism, populism, and opposition to
globalism are rising, making collective action difficult. The East Asian
democracies have ongoing territorial disputes with one another. Many
Europeans view China as more of an economic opportunity than a strategic
threat and seriously doubt the United States' reliability as an ally,
having endured four years of tariffs and scorn from President Donald
Trump, who could soon be back in power. Europeans also hold different
views from Americans on data security and privacy, and European
governments fear U.S. technology dominance almost as much as they do
Chinese digital hegemony. India may not be ready to abandon its
traditional policy of nonalignment and back a democratic order,
especially when it is becoming more repressive at home, and an order
built around democracy will struggle to form productive partnerships
with autocracies that would be important partners in any alliance
against China, such as Singapore and Vietnam. [[Fear of China]{.mark} is
a powerful force, but it [might not be potent enough to paper over the
many cracks]{.mark} that exist [within the emerging anti-Chinese
coalition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[If that coalition fails]{.mark} to solidify its international
order]{.underline}, then [[the world will]{.mark} steadily [slide back
into **anarchy**]{.mark}, a struggle among rogue powers and regional
blocs in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they
must. Some scholars assume---or hope---that an unordered world will sort
itself out on its own, that great powers will carve out stable spheres
of influence and avoid conflict or that the spread of international
commerce and enlightened ideas will naturally maintain global peace and
prosperity. But peace and prosperity are unnatural. When achieved, they
are the result of sustained cooperation among great
powers---]{.underline}that is, [of an international order.]{.underline}

Doubling Down On Democracy

[[History shows]{.mark} that [eras of fluid multipolarity]{.mark}
typically [end in **disaster**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [regardless of the
bright ideas or advanced tech]{.underline}nologies [circulating at the
time. [The late eighteenth century]{.mark} witnessed the pinnacle of the
Enlightenment in Europe]{.underline}, [before the continent [descended
into the hell of the Napoleonic Wars. At the start of the twentieth
century]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the world's sharpest minds predicted an
end to great-power conflict as railways, telegraph cables, and
steamships linked countries closer together. [The worst war in
history]{.mark} up to that point quickly [followed.]{.mark} The sad and
paradoxical reality is that [international orders are vital to avert
chaos]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[yet]{.mark} they typically [emerge **only
during periods of great-power rivalry**. Competing with China]{.mark}
will be fraught with risk for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies, but it [might be **the only way to
avoid even greater dangers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To build a better future, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and its allies will need to take a more enlightened view of their
interests than they did even during the Cold War. Back then, their
economic interests dovetailed nicely with their geopolitical interests.
Simple greed]{.underline}, [if nothing else]{.underline}, [could compel
capitalist states to band together to protect private property against a
communist onslaught. Now]{.underline}, however, [the choice is not so
simple]{.underline}, [because standing up to China will entail
significant economic costs]{.underline}, [especially in the short term.
Those costs might pale in comparison to the long-term costs of business
as usual with Beijing]{.underline}---Chinese espionage has been
estimated to deprive the United States alone of somewhere between \$200
billion and \$600 billion annually---[to say nothing of the moral
quandaries and geopolitical risks of cooperating with a brutal
totalitarian regime with revanchist ambitions. Yet the ability to make
such an enlightened calculation in favor of confronting China may be
beyond the capacities of any nation, especially ones as polarized as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and many of its democratic
allies.]{.underline}

[If there is any hope, it lies in a renewed commitment to democratic
values. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies
share a common aspiration for [an international order based on
democratic principles and enshrined in international agreements and
laws]{.mark}. The core of such an order [is being forged in the crucible
of competition with China and could be built out into **the most
enlightened order the world has ever seen**]{.mark}---a genuine free
world. But [to get there, the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its allies will have to **embrace
competition with China**]{.mark} and march forward together through
another long twilight struggle.]{.underline}

#### [Nuclear escalation]{.underline} is likely --- urgently strengthening [allied coordination]{.underline} to send a [signal of resolve]{.underline} is the only way to prevent it.

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin has
placed his nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned
that any effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result
in "consequences you have never seen."]{.underline} Such saber-rattling
has understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. [But
if China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [came to Taipei's aid, the threat of escalation
could outstrip even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe.]{.underline}

[A recent war game]{.underline}, [conducted by]{.underline} the
[C]{.underline}enter for a [N]{.underline}ew [A]{.underline}merican
[S]{.underline}ecurity in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," [demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027]{.underline}, [with the
aim of examining how the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
China might act under a certain set of conditions. The game demonstrated
that [China's **mil**]{.mark}**itary [mod]{.mark}ernization** [and
**expansion of its nuclear arsenal**]{.mark}]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with
Taiwan---[[mean]{.mark} that]{.underline}, **[[in the real
world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[a fight between China and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[**could very
well go nuclear**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. If the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty
[decides to invade the island, its [leaders **may not be able to accept
failure** without]{.mark} seriously [harming]{.mark} the regime's
[**legitimacy**.]{.mark} Thus]{.underline}, [[the CCP might be willing
to take **significant risks**]{.mark} to ensure that the conflict ends
on terms that it finds acceptable. That would mean convincing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies that the costs
of defending Taiwan are so high that it is not worth contesting the
invasion. While China has several ways to achieve that goal, **[from
Beijing's perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[using nuclear weapons
may be **the most effective means**]{.mark} to keep the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [out of the
conflict.]{.underline}

Gearing For Battle

[China is several decades into transforming its]{.underline} People's
Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [into what]{.underline} the Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has called a "world-class military"
that could defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense.
China's warfighting strategy]{.underline}, [known as]{.underline}
"**[anti-access/area denial]{.underline}**," [rests on being able to
project conventional military power out several thousand miles in order
to prevent the American military]{.underline}, in particular, [from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, [[a **growing nuclear arsenal** provides]{.mark} Beijing with
[**coercive leverage** as well as]{.mark} potentially **[new warfighting
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} could [**increase
the risks of war and escalation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. [The]{.underline} U.S.
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
[projects that by 2030, China will have around 1,000 deliverable
warheads---more than **triple** the number it currently possesses. Based
on these projections, Chinese [leaders]{.mark} may [believe that **as
early as five years from now** the PLA]{.mark} will have made enough
conventional and nuclear gains that it [could fight and win a
war]{.mark} to unify [with Taiwan.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members of Congress, former
government officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of
senior national security decision makers in China and the United
States---[illustrated that [a U.S.-Chinese war could **escalate
quickly**.]{.mark}]{.underline} For one thing, [it showed that [both
countries would face **operational incentives** to strike military
forces]{.mark} on the other's territory.]{.underline} In the game, [such
strikes were **intended** to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both
sides tried to **walk a fine line** by attacking only military targets.
But [such attacks crossed red lines]{.mark} for both
countries]{.underline}, [[and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle**]{.mark}
**of attacks** [that broadened the **scope** and **intensity**]{.mark}
of the conflict.]{.underline}

For instance, in the simulation, China launched a preemptive attack
against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The attacks targeted
Guam, in particular, because it is a forward operating base critical to
U.S. military operations in Asia, and because since it is a territory,
and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as less
escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In response, the
United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and surrounding
facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland.
Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on their
home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii.

A New Era

[One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that [China
found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear **from the start**]{.mark}
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan.]{.underline} This
threat was repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland
China had been attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so
that it would back down from the fight received greater attention by the
China team than the invasion of Taiwan itself. [[But China had
difficulty convincing the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates that [its
nuclear threats were credible.]{.mark} In real life, China's significant
and recent changes to its nuclear posture and readiness may impact other
nations' views]{.underline}, [as its nuclear threats may not be viewed
as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its smaller but
burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making nuclear
threats. [This may push China to **preemptively detonate**]{.mark} **a
nuclear weapon** [to **reinforce the credibility of its
warning**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because
of **constraints** on its long-range conventional strike capabilities.
Five years from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to
launch conventional attacks beyond]{.underline} locations in the "second
island chain" in the Pacific; namely, [Guam and Palau. Unable to strike
the U.S. homeland with conventional weapons, China would struggle to
impose costs on the American people.]{.underline} Up until a certain
point in the game, the U.S. team felt its larger nuclear arsenal was
sufficient to deter escalation and did not fully appreciate the
seriousness of China's threats. As a result, China felt it needed to
escalate significantly to send a message that the U.S. homeland could be
at risk if Washington did not back down. Despite China's stated
"no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game resulted in Beijing
detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii as a demonstration.
The attack caused relatively little destruction, as the electromagnetic
pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the immediate vicinity
but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war game ended before
the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the first use of a
nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a response.

[The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China are different from
those that were most likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [feared a
massive]{.underline}, [bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack]{.underline},
[which would precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a
confrontation over Taiwan,]{.underline} however, [Beijing could employ
nuclear weapons in a more limited way to signal resolve or to improve
its chances of winning on the battlefield. It is unclear how a war would
proceed after that kind of limited nuclear use and whether the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives.]{.underline}

An Ounce of Prevention

[The clear lesson from the war game is that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs to
**strengthen its conventional capabilities**]{.mark} **in the
Indo-Pacific** to ensure that China never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move.]{.underline} To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks.

Moreover, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs]{.mark} to develop [an
**integrated network of partners**]{.mark} willing to contribute to
Taiwan's defense. [Allies are an **asymmetric advantage**]{.mark}: the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has them]{.underline}, [and
China does not. [The U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should **deepen strategic and
operational planning with key partners** to send a **strong signal of
resolve**]{.mark} to China.]{.underline} As part of these planning
efforts, the United States and its allies will need to develop
war-winning military strategies that do not cross Chinese red-lines. The
game highlighted just how difficult this task may be; what it did not
highlight is the complexity of developing military strategies that
integrate the strategic objectives and military capacities of multiple
nations.

Moving forward, [military planners in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} in Washington's [allies and
partners must grapple with the fact that]{.underline}, [in a conflict
over Taiwan, China would consider all conventional and nuclear options
to be on the table.]{.underline} And [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is **running out of time** to
**strengthen deterrence**]{.mark} and keep China from believing an
invasion of Taiwan could be successful. The biggest risk is that
Washington and its friends choose not to seize the moment and act: **[a
year or two from now]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**it might already be too
late**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Introduction

[[NATO and the West are experiencing]{.mark} a **[reversed]{.mark} kind
of**]{.underline} revolution in military affairs
(**[[RMA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [with new tech]{.underline}nologies
[bearing far-reaching implications beyond the conduct of war. Past
revolutions in military spilled from the battlefield to the civilian
sector.]{.underline} They had an effect either by directly impacting the
result of a given conflict or through adoption of military technical
advantages in non-military aspects of life. [Today]{.underline}, [we see
an opposite trend brought by the private and non-military]{.underline},
[non-governmental actors. In their everyday lives, general publics and
governments alike face military-grade tech]{.underline}nologies
[developed and applied by the commercial sector. And it is the private
sector that enjoys exclusivity over these tech]{.underline}nologies
[while the military lags behind.]{.underline}

How information is gathered, processed, analysed, communicated,
distributed, and utilized has always underlined military planning and
assumptions for success in conflict. For example, the reconnaissance
strike complex introduced by the Soviets was based on real-time
intelligence gathering and underpinned by automated systems and fast
data processing. Similarly, NATO's deep attack concept assumed that
commanders "would be given the automated assessment means necessary to
rapidly analyse the enemy's force array."\[1\] Such concepts, however
innovative and tech-based, assumed a relatively limited amount of data
and relied heavily on the human factor. Today, in the era of cloud
computing and artificial intelligence, there is a clear shift towards
sensor-centric, automated processing. Reconnaissance and analysis are
becoming as important as firepower and kinetic effects. Humans are being
pushed out from the decision-making due to the quantity of information
gathered/coming from the battlefield. The hyper-speed warfare (or the
"hyper war," a term linking the intensity of conflict with cybernetics)
risks making the human factor almost obsolete. To a certain extent,
human presence in the loop will consequently become more a question of
morality and less of efficacy.

[None of this is science fiction]{.underline}, [as modern
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[enabling hyper war **already
exist**. The question]{.mark} for NATO and the West [is not
**whether**]{.mark} they choose [to adopt]{.mark} these
tech]{.underline}nologies [[but **how**]{.mark} they should adopt them
to their benefit.]{.underline}

The situation is even more complicated if we consider the myriad of
actors involved in international security. In the past, timing and
accuracy of decision-making depended on a system designed by the state,
was utilized on the state level, and made for the state's purpose.
Today, external entities such as corporations, non-state actors, groups
of citizens and individuals matter as well. They hold the power and the
technological means to exercise significant pressure over state affairs.
Some even have the ability to largely cripple the functioning of
governments and state services.

[This development poses a **significant challenge** to NATO's ability to
deliver on its core tasks. If the Alliance wants to successfully
continue its political-military adaptation, it will need a new approach
to decision-making, operational planning, and crisis
management.]{.underline}

This article addresses some of the key issues the Alliance needs to
consider as it navigates through the new kind of revolution in military
affairs: 1) the changing character of warfare; 2) the domination of the
private sector over the military in the deployment of commercial
technology with military potential; 3) and the interdependence of
decision-making and modern technology.

The Changed Nature of Warfare

[Modern tech]{.underline}nologies [are **changing the nature of
warfare**]{.underline}, [as they have throughout the human
history.]{.underline} In many instances, introduction of new weaponry
constituted for a tactical advantage on the battlefield, occasionally
reaching a strategic-level impact. An example of that can be the
introduction of the British longbow at the Battle of Agincourt. Other
technologies changed profoundly how militaries operate and wage war.
Among such examples are railroads, telegraph, radar, combustion engine,
jet engine, or radio frequencies-based communication equipment. The
revolutionary nature of these technologies usually brings about
significant changes in defence planning, command and control, and force
organization.

[For]{.underline} any institution, be it a nation state, a large
bureaucracy, or an international alliance such as [NATO, the ability to
adopt disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [is key.]{.underline} The
adoption usually leads to a larger structural adaptation: The use of
standardized calibres in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars
allowed for greater flexibility and uniformity of the French forces. The
first use of Marconi's wireless telegraphy by the British armed forces
in the Anglo-Boer War (1899-1902) changed the way how military
communicated. The use of railroads in the 19th century wars had a
strategic effect on the mobility and supply of forces. Finally, the
deployment of radar technology during World War 2 improved both
defensive and offensive capacities of the militaries, and, as a result,
probably saved thousands of lives. In all these instances, the military
advancement of technologies spilled over to the civilian side as well.

In the past five decades, military science theorists have been dealing
with the evolution in warfare in more detail. Although the main focus
was dedicated to the then-ongoing Cold War, scholars from the field made
a number of predictions that have proven to be correct. They correctly
understood that technological advancement was gaining momentum and that
the upcoming changes were not going be evolutionary but would come in
leaps.\[2\]

Three concepts also emerged from this thinking: military technical
revolution (MTR), revolution in military affairs (RMA), and military
revolution (MR). Even though they stand individually, all three concepts
are closely interconnected. For example, technology or a weapon platform
that has reached the level of military technical revolution can, in the
end, reach the level of military revolution as long as it constitutes
considerable changes to organizational structure and operational art. In
several cases, the MTR, RMA and MR are seen as one concept
altogether.\[3\]

Military Technical Revolution, Revolution in Military Affairs, and
Military Revolution

An event has to meet several conditions to qualify as a MTR/RMA/MR. A
revolution is defined by a profound change in military systems,
operational art, and organizational adjustment. Simple introduction of
new technology or military platform does not constitute an MTR.

As Andrew F. Krepinevich, a defence policy analyst, writes,\[4\] a
real-world example of military technical revolution can be unmanned
combat vehicles and their role in conducting combat and ISR operations.
Another example are cyber defence/offense oriented forces that fulfil
the following criteria: technological change---introduction of new
military platforms; evolution of military systems; operational
innovation (e.g., cyberspace defence planning); or organizational
adaptation impacting force structure and organizational units.

[A military revolution in effect alters the way in which power is
projected. Apart from changing the shape and form of warfare, it spills
over from the military organizational structures and battlefields into
societal, economic, and political domains.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} above-mentioned [enablers of military
revolution]{.underline}, [such as a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence [and quantum tech]{.underline}nology
[applications]{.underline}, [show promising potential in changing the
current societal fabric and effectively impacting societal, political,
and military affairs.]{.underline}

[Among the decisive factors]{.underline}, [universal to all combat
operations]{.underline}, [is time. As the pace of
tech]{.underline}nological [advancement increases, the potential effects
of a tech]{.underline}nology [are no longer the [most important]{.mark}
factor. Equally important [is **the pace**]{.mark} **of adaption**: how
**fast** a tech]{.underline}nology [can be utilized and how it
recalibrates the relation between action and reaction. As time remains
of immense importance, the ability to share info]{.underline}rmation
[and move forces around based on that info]{.underline}rmation [can be
the decisive factor in conflict. The speed of info]{.underline}rmation
[sharing can thus be considered a military revolution.]{.underline}\[5\]
The introduction of combustion engines and the changes it brought to
operational art, manoeuvring, and transport of forces, changed the time
factor. Unparalleled sensory awareness, communication, and automation
have the same potential.

Consequently, time available for decision-making will continue to
shrink. Decision makers will have to be equipped with information and
intelligence as accurate as possible. The "speed of information" will be
critical to provide political guidance to commanders or even to conduct
a pre-emptive strike. There may be instances when the pace of combat
operations will increase to a threshold where defensive action will be
rendered useless.\[6\] Technology that can process this "speed of
information" will affect the entire decision-making algorithm and
broader perception of security and defence in society.

Militarization of Technology and the Role of Private Sector

The 21st century introduced an unparalleled speed of innovation and
dissemination of (digital) technology among the general population and
the private sector. It also hindered states' ability to remain the sole
proprietor of military grade applications. This is due to an
unprecedented redistribution of applied research from the government
level towards the private sector. Today, private entities commercialize
disruptive technologies and provide them directly to the customers,
unleashing military level applications into the wild. The governments,
namely national security and defence domains are lagging behind in
adoption of innovative technologies. This is evident from the spending
on military research and development, which is dim in comparison to its
private sector equivalents.\[7\] For example, in 2004, the global
spending on civilian research and development was approximately ten
times as large as global military research and development.\[8\]

[Emerging disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [are]{.underline} thus
[becoming **more accessible**. The interdependency between state
instruments of power (including armed forces) and civilian
tech]{.underline}nology [is growing and is expected to grow even
further. In the past, military platforms were developed by the private
sector, but their sole purpose was defined by the military. Today's
world brings the challenge of dual-use tech]{.underline}nology [that is
researched, manufactured, and provided entirely by the private
sector]{.underline}, [while having military application. Which
effectively impacts the competitiveness on the battlefield.]{.underline}
With facial recognition, targeting, and other artificial
intelligence-powered applications (including micro targeting on social
networks), the interest of the private sector and state actors overlap
and are often blurred. [It is common for state actors to be dependent on
private sector providers.]{.underline} Sometimes to the extent where the
government is unable to adjust the technologies' conditions for its
purposes, as the usual customer base lies in the civilian business
world.

The rise of corporations and digital tycoons brought about
democratization of technologies and their global spread in an
unprecedented speed, resulting in a digital interdependency. States have
been replaced by private entities who hold the keys to information flow
and disruptive technologies. These technologies are often introduced to
the general public sooner than the governmental bodies even have a
chance to understand them.

[Tech]{.underline}nological [superiority has always played a significant
role in i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations[. It usually
derived from the use of force and was traditionally in the hands of the
state. In the past few decades, non-state entities started surpassing
the state's control. Tech]{.underline}nology [provided by corporations
paired with ideology and strategic interests of various state
actors.]{.underline} However, [[state actors]{.underline}]{.mark} were
not equipped with proper organizational structures and decision-making
processes to stay up to date. As result, they [[have been left
behind]{.mark} not to **lead**]{.underline}, [but [to **react**
to]{.mark} tech]{.underline}nological [progress and
[innovations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Quantum research on sensors\[9\] can be an example of the private
sector's success. Non-state actors currently both employ the leading
scientists in the field and conduct research in cooperation with
competing state interests. All that despite the efforts of the
governmental bodies and the military to fund innovative research.\[10\]
This substantially increases the prospects of quantum related
applications being provided to the general population before they are
utilized by the military, leading to a loss in competitiveness on the
battlefield.

The issue is caused by the inability of governmental entities to
appreciate the need to conduct basic and applied research competitively
with the private sector. In order for it to be done correctly, it would
require a substantial organizational change and the ability to
understand the potential impacts of disruptive technologies. That is
also necessary for proper resource allocation. Modern and disruptive
technologies are part of the non-conventional military risks and
destabilizing efforts that governmental structures fail to address. A
number of technological platforms, social networks, and digital enablers
have become tools of digital deceit. They have been used to target the
general population, which was unaware of being exposed to hybrid tactics
and military grade influence operations.\[11\] This was enabled by
overlaps of influence-operation techniques from the military field into
the private sector. Private companies also applied these techniques in
target group advertising.

[This is not the first time the West has had to deal with ideological
competitors trying to gain supremacy. The Cold War was about **both**
ideology and tech]{.underline}nology, with the stark example of
Operation Farewell.\[12\] Even then, [tech]{.underline}nological
[superiority was meant to promote ideological and strategic
interests.]{.underline} The combination of ideology and technology
continued to be a factor in the post-Cold War world. An example of that
can be terrorist organizations and their use of basic available
technology. The situation in 2021 is, however, starkly different from
the 1980's or the 2000s for a number of reasons:

\* As argued earlier, the character of warfare has changed profoundly;
technologically driven warfare has entered the soft power arena.

\* The pace of military operations and general interactions has
increased--- he human capacity is now limited not only by the speed of
events but also by the amount of information collected, processed, and
analysed from the battlefield. The ISR platforms are collecting so much
data and raw intelligence that it is necessary to automate processes
previously not constrained by human capacity or reaction speed demands.
The changes pushing the limits of human operators and analysts happen in
leaps and are fast paced.

\* What is more: private sector capacities play a significant role in
international power competition. Technological tycoons represent
stand-alone actors risen on the wealth and influence of the technology
they provide. They have also become the tools of state influence.
Understanding this shift is hard, as we tend to differentiate between
private entities, corporations with presence on the global markets, and
state actors. However, in many cases, the private corporations are bound
by national legislation, hiding as agents of influence in plain sight.

\* As a result, we see traditional technological powers (the West, led
by the United States, with Europe lagging behind) and democratic tech
tycoons, including Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, capitalizing on the
asymmetry provided by modern technologies. While China, Russia, and
India aspire to supersede them, this aspiration is evident from both
their official policies and their investment in new technologies and
defence modernization. What started as mainly intellectual property
transfer and theft\[13\] has now turned into a full-fledged
technological adoption race.\[14\]

Implications for NATO

So where does all this leave NATO? In 2021, as [NATO]{.underline} has
already begun to define its vision for the next ten years, it [faces
three principle challenges:]{.underline}

1\. [Ensuring that decision-makers **understand the sheer potential**
derived from emerging and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [and
**how they will impact** the Alliance's governance and decision
models.]{.underline}

2\. [Prioritizing **what** tech]{.underline}nologies, [the Alliance
should pursue, **when**, and **how they fit** into NATO's wider
posture;]{.underline}

3\. **[Sharing the tech]{.underline}**nological [burden equally across
the Alliance.]{.underline}

Raising awareness among political leaders about the new technologies'
impact on NATO may not be as simple as it seems. Currently, [there is a
**growing gap in perception** of the new tech]{.underline}nology['s
importance between the political and military level. Military
authorities of the Alliance have]{.underline}, [for a long
time]{.underline}, [been highlighting the need for innovation and
adoption of new tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}\[15\] [Trials
of innovative tech]{.underline}nological [solutions and new capabilities
have been part of NATO's military training and exercises.]{.underline}
For example, NATO now regularly tests unmanned systems in the maritime
area\[16\] and there is work being done in the area of Electronic
Spectrum warfare. Furthermore, adoption of new technologies in new
capabilities development has been encouraged through the NATO Defence
Planning Process (NDPP). In 2018, the Allied Command Transformation
developed Emerging and Disruptive Technologies Roadmap, which received
political endorsement at the meeting of defence ministers in June 2019.

[On the political front, the effort has been slower.]{.underline} Until
recently, the Allies themselves have maintained a rather declaratory
approach to technology and innovation. Later, in 2020, the Secretary
General appointed an innovation advisory group to provide counsel on
NATO's next steps in the tech area. A full political strategy on the
emerging and disruptive technologies was finally adopted at the Brussels
Summit in June 2021: "\[T\]his strategy seeks to preserve our
interoperability; safeguard our sensitive technologies; and actively
address the threats and challenges posed by technological developments
by others, both now and in the future. Drawing on the extensive
innovation expertise of all 30 Allies, we will further leverage our
partnerships, including with the private sector and academia, to
maintain our technological edge.\[17\]"

[The [Allies pledged to launch]{.mark}]{.underline} a civil-military
Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and]{.mark} to establish a
[N]{.mark}ATO [I]{.mark}nnovation [F]{.mark}und. The aim is to promote
interoperability, foster development and adoption of
tech]{.underline}nological [solutions, and to allow individual NATO
Members to support start-ups working on dual use emerging and disruptive
tech]{.underline}nologies [relevant to NATO's security.]{.underline} The
Allies also agreed to continue developing capabilities in the
technological domain and recognized the need for research and
development and innovation to meet the challenges emerging and
disruptive technologies pose. Some of the specific areas where new
capabilities must be acquired are air-to-air refuelling, training,
precision strike, munitions, air defence, CBRN defence, autonomous
systems, and next-generation rotorcraft capability.\[18\]

[The process will require **effective prioritization**. The]{.underline}
afore-mentioned [NATO Defence Planning Process already accounts for
future tech]{.underline}nological [change in military capability
development. Allies have a free reign in how they wish to meet the
target]{.underline}, [including what platform and
tech]{.underline}nology [they wish to choose. [The pitfall]{.mark} of
this approach [lies in]{.mark} the traditional view of military
tech]{.underline}nology [adoption and capability
development.]{.underline} More specifically, [the issue is [the
**government-centric model**]{.mark} that operates with significantly
longer lifecycles as well as the ownership structures that find no
applicable parallel in the private sector's current pacing and push out
of emerging and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[It will be up to NATO to use both its new and already-existing tools to
help navigate through these tech]{.underline}nologies [and decide on
which to adopt first. Together with the Allies and the private sector,
[NATO/DIANA should]{.mark} scan the horizon and [**say** **which new
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[are]{.mark} to be integrated with
[**highest priority**.]{.mark} NATO must then proceed with the
integration into its planning]{.underline} (both capability and civil
emergency)[, training and exercises]{.underline}, [as well as the
Alliance's wider consultation and decision-making.]{.underline}

[The adoption must happen **systematically**]{.underline}, [[at the
**highest political level**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Brussels Summit
should be an impulse for the Council to start incorporating more
technologically driven discussions into its deliberations.
Scenario-based discussions and NATO's high-level exercise program should
include situations where emerging and disruptive technologies play a
decisive role. [None of this requires any radical changes to the
decision-making procedures or new tools.]{.underline}

[Although the NATO Innovation Fund is **a step in the right direction**,
it must reflect the **disparities** that exist among individual Member
States in this context. [Many]{.mark} Allies [have **national
assets**]{.mark} that fulfil various tech innovation
functions.]{.underline} For example, the UK's jHub Defence Innovation
helps integrate market-ready solutions into military.\[19\] In 2020,
Germany established an agency for innovation in cyber security to
promote technological innovation and solutions that would enhance the
country's security.\[20\] [[NATO should serve as a platform where
nations]{.mark} with **more advanced structures, know-how and
capabilities come forward and [share]{.mark}** some of these solutions
and findings with other Allies.]{.underline}

[[The N]{.mark}ATO [I]{.mark}nnovation [F]{.mark}und [should]{.mark}
also [facilitate **burden-sharing**]{.mark} in this area.
[Emerging]{.mark} and disruptive [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies
[[have]{.mark} so far [been **guarded** as a **national
treasure**]{.mark}; their application and availability in multinational
context has been **scarce**. In the future, not all Allies will possess
or have access to new tech]{.underline}nologies [shaping the military
capabilities and conduct. Some countries will be faster in
tech]{.underline}nological [adoption. Others may not be able to afford
new tech]{.underline}nologies, [if they are to meet all other
requirements for NATO's collective defence. [The Fund can]{.mark} be a
mechanism that **[balance]{.mark}s out these [gaps]{.mark}** and
**spreads the burden more equally** among the Allies. NATO must now
design a system of allocation]{.underline}---currently envisioned on a
voluntary basis---[that will motivate the Allies to contribute to it.
This must take into account **national requirements** that might be
limiting for some Allies and **the danger of duplicity with similar
endeavours**.]{.underline}

[There are **several examples of sharing mechanisms** that NATO has
successfully adopted in the past and can now build on]{.underline}: 1)
Nuclear-sharing arrangements where non-nuclear members of NATO support
potential nuclear missions and the decision-making without possessing
the nuclear technology; 2) Common-funded capability models, such as the
Allied Ground Surveillance system or NATO's Ballistic Missile Defence,
where Allies fund and outsource the development of technology through
common / joint financial contributions; while both slightly different in
structure and funding, both are an example of technology funded by some
Allies, but made available to the entire Alliance. Both examples link to
previous revolutions in military affairs. Until now, the closest the
Allies have come to having a new technology sharing mechanism is the
Sovereign Cyber Effects Provided Voluntarily by Allies mechanism. It
allows the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) to request offensive
effects to be delivered on a designated target, without sharing the
technology with others.\[21\]

[All these examples have one thing in common: tech]{.underline}nological
[know-how and i]{.underline}ntellectual [p]{.underline}roperty [remains
in the hands of the capability providers. This gives NATO an opportunity
to **forge [new]{.mark} tech-sharing [arrangements]{.mark}** [that would
include **individual Allies** and **the private sector**]{.mark}. This
[could]{.mark} also **[prevent the tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological
[**[gap]{.mark} among Allies [from widening]{.mark}** any
further.]{.underline}

One specific solution could be creating a private sector parallel to
NATO's political partnerships. However, the criteria for such
partnerships might be hard to agree on. NATO would have to find a way to
satisfy some highly political questions, such as: What companies and
what technologies would be represented? Or would Allies even be able and
willing to generate funds to support a NATO-branded research &
development?

In the meantime, NATO must approach the prioritization of emerging and
disruptive technologies by employing its traditional strengths: define
its technological requirements through the prism of military
requirements and forge a consensus among thirty Allies on the general
technological pathway. [When NATO **sets the standards**, individual
Allies are usually very capable of delivering]{.underline}, [according
to their national preferences and legislation.]{.underline}

Lastly, [in its ongoing efforts to address the challenge of emerging and
disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies, [NATO must take into account
similar]{.underline}, [already existing or maturing projects and
structures.]{.underline} The European Union sees emerging and disruptive
technologies as a crucial issue and has developed mechanisms through
which they are tackled. The European Defence Agency recognizes
technological development as one of the main pillars of its work and
provides a useful platform for international cooperation. It aims to
support Member States in developing and improving capabilities on a
cutting-edge technological level of its Member States and shape their
national strategies in this area. The European Defence Fund deals with
both technological research and defence capability development and even
specifically allocates a part of its financial resources for disruptive
technologies.

[[A major task]{.underline}]{.mark} for the two organizations
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[be to]{.mark} find a way to
**cooperate** on this issue and **[avoid]{.mark} undesirable
[duplication]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Alliance and the EU
must come up with a solution where the EuroAtlantic area is capable of
adapting to the ever-changing security environment and can readily adopt
fast-advancing technologies. What is more, both sides of the Atlantic
must be equally capable partners in this cooperation and burden sharing.

Conclusion

[Tech]{.underline}nological [change is **real**, **fast paced**, and
**greatly affects** NATO's civilian-military structures. Never has the
Alliance faced so many tech]{.underline}nological [changes that would
reach beyond the traditional realm of security and defence.]{.underline}

In the 1990s, [the key political question for the future of
NATO]{.underline} was whether to adapt by going out of area (in terms of
operations and membership) or go out of business. The question for the
next couple of years is essentially the same; it [touches the very
purpose and existence of the Alliance and the utility of NATO: How to
make sure that NATO stays tech]{.underline}nologically [relevant so that
it can maintain its function and capabilities. **Complacency** and
**general political statements** will not suffice. The private
sector]{.underline}, [which is the principal agent of the new kind of
r]{.underline}evolution in [m]{.underline}ilitary [a]{.underline}ffairs,
[is technologically advancing in leaps. If NATO is not able to keep up
with this change in organization of geopolitics and
tech]{.underline}nology, [it will have to change its organizational
structure. With modern and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies
[becoming more mainstream and moving into wider governance structures,
similar adjustments will be necessary in NATO's daily business
operations.]{.underline}

[[NATO **can** successfully navigate the]{.mark} new wave of
[r]{.mark}]{.underline}evolution in [[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ilitary
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}ffairs[; however, [it must]{.mark} first [change
its **political culture** and **overall approach** to]{.mark} modern and
disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies[. It also needs to develop **new
[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology[**[-sharing mechanisms]{.mark}** that
will be fair to all Allies.]{.underline} There may be different
approaches to this change: a reform of NATO's procurement agencies, a
reform of financial mechanisms, or a partnership reform. Either way,
[any such effort will have to build on the **active participation** of
the private sector. [**Only then** will NATO]{.mark} be able to
**[maintain its tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological [**[edge]{.mark} in
the future**.]{.underline}

#### Failing to maintain NATO's technological superiority will cause [great power nuclear war]{.underline} --- out-competing Russia and China in the [EDT RMA]{.underline} is key.

New Tech Arms Race

[Many analysts believe the [emerging tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [of
the 4IR could profoundly affect military capabilities and operational
concepts.]{.underline}35 [New tech]{.underline}nology [[has had
**revolutionary effects**]{.mark} on warfare and international politics
**[throughout history]{.mark}** from the Bronze Age to the gunpowder and
nuclear revolutions.]{.underline}36

[New tech]{.underline}nologies [with direct military application are in
development]{.underline}, [including AI, quantum
info]{.underline}rmation [tech]{.underline}nology[, hypersonic missiles,
directed energy, additive manufacturing, and
biotech]{.underline}nology[. How exactly these technologies will affect
the future of warfare is still uncertain. The]{.underline} \[end page
64\] [National Defense Strategy Commission report charges that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [lacks clear operational
concepts for combat with Russia and China.]{.underline}37
[Still]{.underline}, [there is reason to believe these new
tech]{.underline}nologies [could have meaningful military applications
but perhaps not to the advantage of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its Allies and partners. At present, [Russia
and]{.mark} especially [China might transcend the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its
Allies]{.mark} and partners [in]{.mark} some [key]{.mark} 4IR
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

Indeed, [[**AI** could transform]{.mark} the future of
[warfare]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including through the development of
lethal autonomous systems.]{.underline}38 [These "killer robots" may
lower the threshold of conflict by allowing political leaders to take a
country to war without risking the lives of human soldiers. When
produced in large numbers, these drones could operate in swarms that
overwhelm enemy military platforms and targets.]{.underline}39

[A]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence [could also be
employed to rapidly sort through vast quantities of data, improving
i]{.underline}ntelligence, [s]{.underline}urveillance, and
[r]{.underline}econnaissance [and making it easier to track and target
enemy forces. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [retains
important advantages in AI]{.underline}, [including through its
world-leading university system. But China]{.underline}, [with its large
population and surveillance tactics]{.underline}, [has access to more
data to train its AI algorithms.]{.underline}40 [Beijing is also less
constrained by ethical and moral concerns and has the lead in some
applications of AI]{.underline}, [including facial-recognition
tech]{.underline}nology[.]{.underline}

[**Quantum computing** promises information advantages including the
ability to have secure, encrypted communications and to decode enemy
communications.]{.underline} In its 2021 Military Balance report, the
International Institute for Strategic Studies states, "the integration
of quantum technologies currently represents one of the most anticipated
advances for armed forces. ... [There is little doubt that they will
have disruptive effect when they are employed at scale.]{.underline}"41
[China may have the edge in this area]{.underline}, [as it was the first
country to conduct a successful test of a quantum
satellite.]{.underline}42

[[**Space** and **cyber** are increasingly important]{.mark} military
domains. Space-based weapons, sensors, defensive interceptors, and the
diffusion of counterspace capabilities will make space an increasingly
contested military environment.]{.underline}43 [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is relatively more dependent on space-based assets
and computers than its rivals]{.underline}, [and the]{.underline} US
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [warns
Russia and China will likely employ cyber and counter- space attacks in
the early stage of any conflict with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [in a bid to disrupt US]{.underline} command,
control, communications, computers, intel- ligence, surveillance, and
reconnaissance ([C4ISR]{.underline})[.]{.underline}44

**[Hypersonic missiles]{.underline}**, maneuverable and able to travel
at over five times the speed of sound, [could allow states to conduct
low- or no-warning attacks]{.underline} \[end page 65\] [and to evade
missile defenses.]{.underline}45 [These weapons could also execute
large-scale]{.underline}, [nonnuclear strategic attacks, the rate of
speed compressing the decision-making time leaders have to respond to
such attacks. Although the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[developed the initial concepts for these weapons, Russia and China have
prioritized their production, testing, and deployment. China has
conducted more hypersonic tests than any other nation]{.underline}, [and
Moscow and Beijing have deployed hypersonic weapons.]{.underline}46

[Many other emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [have military
applications. **Directed-energy microwaves and lasers** could allow
states to develop more effective integrated air and missile defense
systems or to degrade an enemy's command and control.]{.underline}47
[**Additive manufacturing** could greatly reduce the cost of producing
component parts of military platforms and creates the potential for
large and rapid quantitative increases in weapons systems]{.underline},
[from drones and tanks to submarines and nuclear weapons.]{.underline}48

**[[Biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology [[could]{.mark} be exploited to
[produce "super soldiers."]{.mark} China has genetically engineered
beagles with three times the muscle mass of a typical canine, a
tech]{.underline}nology [that could possibly be applied to
humans.]{.underline}49 [Exoskeletons could provide soldiers with
superhuman strength]{.underline}, [and brain implants promise superior
cognitive performance. China employed exoskeletons in combat in its 2020
border conflict with India.]{.underline}50

[It is not yet clear how these new tech]{.underline}nologies, [when
combined with novel operational concepts]{.underline}, [will affect the
future of warfare, but it is likely they will. A future state
may]{.underline}, [for example]{.underline}, [be able to use additive
manufacturing to produce masses of inexpensive drones directed by new AI
algorithms to swarm and overwhelm adversaries.]{.underline}51 [The
attack might be preceded by cyber and counterspace attacks that blind an
adversary and disrupt its command and control.]{.underline}

[Following a successful advance, the country could then employ
directed-energy weapons, autonomous mines, and other advanced defenses
to lock in territorial gains and thwart enemy attempts to roll back its
aggression. It is possible that **[the first state to hone these]{.mark}
tech**]{.underline}nologies [and devise effective operational concepts
[will have a **military edge**]{.mark} over its opponents.]{.underline}

Novel Applications

How will states use such a newfound advantage? Technology rarely
fundamentally changes the nature or objectives of states. More often,
[[states use tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to advance **preexisting
geopolitical aims**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Moreover, [[enhanced power can
result in **greater ambition**.]{.mark} Given the geopolitical
landscape]{.underline} described, [it is likely the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its Allies and partners at the
core]{.underline} \[end page 66\] [of the international system will
behave differently with new military tech]{.underline}nologies [than
will revisionist powers]{.underline}, [such as Russia and
China.]{.underline}

[[The spread of new tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[to the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its
Allies]{.mark} and partners [would]{.mark} likely serve]{.underline},
[on balance]{.underline}, [to **[reinforce]{.mark} the existing sources
of [stability]{.mark}** in the prevailing international
system.]{.underline} At the end of the Cold War, the United States and
its Allies and partners achieved a technological- military advantage
over its great power rivals, with the US using its unipolar position to
deepen and expand a rules-based system. They also employed their
military dominance to counter perceived threats from rogue states and
terrorist networks. The United States, its Allies, and partners did not,
however, engage in military aggression against great power,
nuclear-armed rivals or their allies.

[In the future, [these]{.mark} status quo [powers]{.mark} are apt to
[use military advantages to]{.mark} reinforce their position in the
international system and to [deter attacks against Allies]{.mark} and
partners in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. These states might also employ
military power to [deal with]{.mark} threats posed by **[terrorist
networks]{.mark}** or by regional revisionist powers such as [**Iran**
and **North Korea**.]{.mark} But it is extremely difficult to imagine
scenarios in which Washington or its Allies or partners would use
newfound military advantages provided by emerging
tech]{.underline}nology [to conduct an armed attack against Russia or
China.]{.underline}

Similarly, [[Moscow and Beijing would]{.mark} likely use any newfound
military strength to advance their preexisting geopolitical
aims.]{.underline} Given their very different positions in the
international system, however, [these states are likely to
[employ]{.mark} new military [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[in
ways that are **destabilizing**.]{.mark} These states have made clear
their dissatisfaction with the existing international system and their
desire to revise it. Both countries have ongoing border disputes with
multiple neighboring countries.]{.underline}

[If Moscow developed new military tech]{.underline}nologies [and
operational concepts that shifted the balance of power in its favor, it
would likely use this advantage to pursue **revisionist aims**. [If
Moscow acquired]{.mark} a [new]{.mark}found [ability to]{.mark} more
easily [invade and occupy territory]{.mark} in Eastern
Europe]{.underline}, [for example (or if Putin believed Russia had such
a capability)]{.underline}, [[it is more likely Russia would]{.mark} be
tempted to [**engage in aggression**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Likewise, [[if China acquired]{.mark} an enhanced ability through new
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[to invade and occupy Taiwan
or]{.mark} contested islands in [the E]{.mark}]{.underline}ast [[or
S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}eas, [[Beijing]{.mark}'s leaders [might]{.mark}
also [find this]{.mark} opportunity [tempting.]{.mark} If new
tech]{.underline}nology [enhances either power's anti-access,
area-denial network]{.underline}, then [its leaders may be more
confident in their ability to achieve a fait accompli attack against a
neighbor and then block a US-led liberation.]{.underline} \[end page
67\]

[[These]{.mark} are precisely the types of [shifts]{.mark} in the
balance of power that [can lead to **war**.]{.mark}]{.underline} As
mentioned previously, [the predominant scholarly theory on the causes of
war---the bargaining model---maintains that imperfect information on the
balance of power and the balance of resolve and credible commitment
problems result in international conflict.]{.underline}52 [New
tech]{.underline}nology [can exacerbate these causal mechanisms by
increasing uncertainty about]{.underline}, [or causing rapid shifts
in]{.underline}, [the balance of power.]{.underline} Indeed as noted
above, [new military tech]{.underline}nology [and the development of new
operational concepts have shifted the balance of power and resulted in
military conflict **throughout history**.]{.underline}

[Some may argue emerging military tech]{.underline}nology [is more
likely to result in a new tech arms race than in conflict. This is
possible. But Moscow and Beijing may come to believe (correctly or not)
that new tech]{.underline}nology [provides them a usable military
advantage over the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its
Allies and partners. In so doing, they may underestimate
Washington.]{.underline}

[[If Moscow or Beijing attacked a]{.mark} vulnerable [US Ally]{.mark} or
partner in their near abroad]{.underline}, therefore, [[there would be a
risk of **major war** with]{.mark} the potential for [**nuclear
escalation**.]{.mark} The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
formal treaty commitments with several frontline states as well as an
ambiguous defense obligation to Taiwan. If Russia or China were to
attack these states, it is likely]{.underline}, [or at least
possible]{.underline}, [that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would come to the defense of the victims. While
many question the wisdom or credibility of America's global commitments,
[it would be difficult for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to]{.mark} simply [back down.]{.mark}
Abandoning a treaty ally could cause fears that America's global
commitments would unravel. Any US president]{.underline}, therefore,
[would feel great pressure to come to an Ally's defense and expel
Russian or Chinese forces.]{.underline}

[Once the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia or China
are at war]{.underline}, [there would be a risk of **nuclear
escalation**.]{.underline} As noted previously, [experts assess the
greatest risk of nuclear war today does **not** come from a
**bolt-out-of-the-blue strike** but from nuclear escalation in a
**regional, conventional conflict**.]{.underline}53 [[Russia]{.mark}n
leaders [may]{.mark} believe it is in their interest to [use nuclear
weapons **early**]{.mark} in a conflict with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and NATO.]{.underline}54 [Russia possesses a large
and diverse arsenal]{.underline}, [including thousands of nonstrategic
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [to support this nuclear
strategy.]{.underline}

In the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review, [Washington indicates it could
retaliate against any Russian nuclear "de-escalation" strikes with
limited nuclear strikes of its own using low-yield nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}55 [The purpose of US strategy is to deter Russian
strikes. **[If deterrence fails]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [[there
is **a clear pathway to nuclear war**]{.mark} between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia.]{.underline} \[end
page 68\] As Henry Kissinger pointed out decades ago, [there is no
guarantee that]{.underline}, [once begun]{.underline}, [a limited
nuclear war stays limited.]{.underline}56

[There are similar risks of nuclear escalation in the event of a
US-China conflict. China has traditionally possessed a relaxed nuclear
posture with a small "lean and effective" deterrent and a formal "no
first use" policy. But China is relying more on its strategic forces. It
is projected to double---if not triple or quadruple---the size of its
nuclear arsenal in the coming decade]{.underline}.57

[Chinese experts have acknowledged there is a narrow range of
contingencies in which China might use nuclear weapons
first.]{.underline}58 As in the case of Russia, [the US Nuclear Posture
Review recognizes the possibility of limited Chinese nuclear attacks and
also holds out the potential of a limited US reprisal with low-yield
nuclear weapons as a deterrent.]{.underline}59 [If the nuclear threshold
is breached in a conflict between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China, **the risk of nuclear exchange is
real**.]{.underline}

In short, [if a coming r]{.underline}evolution in [m]{.underline}ilitary
[a]{.underline}ffairs [provides a real or perceived battlefield
advantage for Russia or China]{.underline}, [such a development raises
the likelihood of **armed aggression against US regional allies**,
**major power war**, and **an increased risk of nuclear
escalation**.]{.underline}

Implications

Future scholarship should incorporate geopolitical conditions and the
related foreign policy goals of the states in question when theorizing
the effects of technology on international politics. Often scholars
attempt to conceptualize the effects of weapons systems in isolation
from the political context in which they are embedded.

Studies treat technology as disembodied from geopolitics and as exerting
independent effects on the international system. But technology does not
float freely. [Tech]{.underline}nology [is a tool different actors can
use in different ways. Bakers and arsonists employ fire in their crafts
to strikingly different ends. In the current international environment,
Russia and China would tend to employ tech]{.underline}nology [toward
advancing revisionist aims. Tech]{.underline}nological [advances in
these countries are]{.underline} therefore [much more likely to
**disrupt the prevailing international order** and **nuclear strategic
stability**.]{.underline}

This approach also suggests [the potential threat new
tech]{.underline}nology [poses to nuclear strategic stability is **more
pervasive** than previously understood. To undermine strategic
stability, new tech]{.underline}nology [need **not** directly impact
strategic capabilities.]{.underline} Rather, [**any**
tech]{.underline}nology [that promises to shift the local balance of
power in Eastern Europe or the Indo-Pacific has the potential to
**threaten nuclear strategic stability**.]{.underline} \[end page 69\]

[This understanding of this issue leads to different policy
prescriptions. If the tech]{.underline}nology [itself is the problem,
then it must be controlled and should not be allowed to spread to any
states. In contrast, the framework outlined here suggests a different
recommendation: preserve the prevailing balance of power in Europe and
Asia. Tech]{.underline}nological [change that]{.underline}, [on
balance]{.underline}, [**reinforces** the prevailing international
system should **strengthen** stability.]{.underline}

[[Leading democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}, [therefore]{.underline},
[[should **increase investments in emerging
tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology **[[to maintain a
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological [**[edge]{.mark}** over their
adversaries.]{.underline} Export control and nonproliferation measures
should be designed to deny emerging military technology to Russia and
China. Arms control should be negotiated with the primary objective of
sustaining the current international distribution of power. [Making
progress in these areas will be difficult. But the [consequences of
failure could be **shifts in the**]{.mark} **international [balance of
power]{.mark}**[, **conflict among great powers**, and]{.mark} **an
increased risk of [nuclear war]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### NATO EDT superiority will cement [effective deterrence]{.underline} --- quickly getting innovative tech [to the battlefield]{.underline} is key.

[[Giving]{.mark} our armed [forces]{.mark} the [proper
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [to perform their mission
[will]{.mark} ultimately [ensure]{.mark} that [**deterrence never
fails**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The key]{.mark} to effective deterrence for the transatlantic alliance
[is **speed**]{.mark}: speed of recognition of the Kremlin's malign
activities; speed of decision to start necessary deployments, movements
and related activities; and speed of assembly to move faster than the
Kremlin to pre-empt attacks and signal our preparedness to act.
Fortunately, a wide range of new tech]{.underline}nologies [are emerging
and evolving that can improve speed]{.underline}, [if they are properly
integrated into our armed forces and into our plans.]{.underline}

[[New tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [that have the greatest
potential to this end include a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[, machine learning, automated systems,
hypersonics, and cyber tech]{.underline}nologies, [among others. All
these tools [can enhance decision-making, improve
interoperability]{.mark} of mission command systems and logistics, help
counter adversaries' unmanned air and maritime systems, [and]{.mark}
facilitate material changes to improve military [mobility. Key to
**maximizing the impact**]{.mark} of these new
tech]{.underline}nologies, [and to making the investment
worthwhile]{.underline}, [[is **coordination** among]{.mark} political
[decision-makers and **industry innovators**]{.mark} to understand
Allies' needs and meet capability requirements.]{.underline}

[Below are some examples of those needs and corresponding
tech]{.underline}nological [requirements.]{.underline} Though in need of
refinement, these provide an azimuth for innovators, policymakers and
industry leaders across the transatlantic community to improve our
collective speed and enhance effective deterrence.

[[Need for Speed of **Recognition**]{.mark}: Recognizing threats,
indicators, and warnings from our adversaries has become increasingly
difficult within the context of hybrid warfare. Unlike in the Cold War,
when the first indicator of an attack may have been T72 tanks coming
over the horizon, today]{.underline}, [the first indicator may be a
cyber-attack that shuts down transportation or financial systems. It
could be a dockworkers' strike in a Baltic port]{.underline}, [or even
attacks on transportation infrastructure by hypersonic missiles. [Being
able to see]{.mark} these [possibilities]{.mark} as they are taking
shape]{.underline}, **[[before they are
effective]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[is necessary to **prevent** or
**respond**]{.mark} to an emerging crisis.]{.underline}

[Requirement: [Tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[that can fuse]{.mark}
the wide range and variety of [intel]{.mark}ligence [and
info]{.mark}rmation [as part of]{.mark} NATO's [**indicators** and
**warnings network** are vital.]{.mark}]{.underline} A U.S. satellite
will most likely not be the first system to detect a hybrid threat or
activity. Instead, it could be a human source, perhaps a customs agent,
border guard, or member of a territorial force. But how does information
about a dockworkers' strike in a Baltic port turn into analysis, for
instance, that reveals this strike was created artificially by FSB
operatives to create a pretext for the Kremlin to interfere abroad? [The
key lies in the ability to quickly and accurately parse through all
available data and reports]{.underline} --- across national and
interagency boundaries, NATO and non-NATO nations, five-eye and
non-five-eye nations --- [using a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[, machine learning, and other fusion
capabilities. This also requires protecting]{.underline} information
[networks from hacks, malware, and other attacks]{.underline}, all the
[while facilitating the sharing of sensitive and classified
info]{.underline}rmation, [using **sophisticated cyber
defenses**.]{.underline}

[[Need for Speed of **Decision**]{.mark}: Authorizing movements and
actions to prevent or respond to an emerging crisis]{.underline},
[within a NATO context]{.underline}, [requires the unanimous consent of
all 30 member states. [Decisions]{.mark} to start moving capabilities,
pull ammunition]{.underline} such as Patriot "Interceptors" [out of
storage depots, and reprioritize military movements]{.underline},
[[demand]{.mark} high-level [decision-makers]{.mark} to [act quickly and
decisively]{.mark}]{.underline}, [despite the sensitive nature of these
activities. [The Kremlin]{.mark} is fully aware of NATO's
decision-making process, the requirement for unanimous consent, and the
political reluctance to delegate such decisions about movement to
operational commanders, and they [aim to **exploit that gap**]{.mark}
through their own centralized decision-making.]{.underline}

[Requirement: This means Allied and partner political decision-makers
need to have access to a variety of info]{.underline}rmation[, plans,
options, and shared courses of action to create appropriate signals and
communicate tasks to commanders in a timely manner. That's why [it's
critical to leverage tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [such as
synthetic environments and human augmentation]{.underline}, [[which can
enable]{.mark} Allied political [leaders to simulate]{.mark} complex,
multi-domain environments, [test]{.mark} time-sensitive decision-making,
and physiological responses, [and course-correct in advance]{.mark}
through sustained exercises and training.]{.underline}

[[Need for Speed of **Assembly**: NATO must]{.mark} demonstrate that
allies are able to move as fast]{.underline}, [or [faster
than]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Russia]{.mark}n Federation forces to
prevent or react to an emerging crisis. The key is signaling to the
Kremlin that any malign activities will either fail or be too costly to
attempt.]{.underline} Still, [NATO must do this in such a way that it
does not unnecessarily provoke or escalate tensions with Russia. [This
requires assembling]{.mark} key forces and capabilities [**quickly** and
**strategically**]{.mark} in pre-crisis or peacetime
conditions.]{.underline}

[Requirement: In order to assemble fast enough,
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[are needed to protect against
**cyber-attacks**]{.mark} against transportation and power-generation
infrastructure and reduce the weight and size of modern armored vehicles
which are difficult to move quickly across the continent to the
frontline. Using tech]{.underline}nology [to develop affordable bridging
assets necessary for the many river crossings in Europe]{.underline},
[as well as to protect against Russian unmanned systems and create a
NATO]{.underline} anti-access aerial denial ([A2AD]{.underline})
[bubble]{.underline}, [should be priorities. Automated
systems]{.underline} --- from robots and drones to active cyber defense
as well as new missile technologies --- [can play crucial roles in
protecting allied and partner deployments and critical
infrastructure.]{.underline}

At the end of the day, [deterrence depends on]{.underline} the women and
men of our [armed forces being trained and ready. Giving them the proper
tech]{.underline}nologies [to perform their mission will give them the
advantages needed to improve awareness, preparedness, and speed
and]{.underline}, ultimately, [**ensure that deterrence never
fails**.]{.underline}

#### NATO deterrence prevents [global hotspot escalation]{.underline} and [great power war]{.underline}.

**\[\*\*\* Note: 9/11 refers to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
against the United States; 11/9 refers to the November 9, 1989 fall of
the Berlin Wall.\]**

Vladimir [Putin's]{.underline} "unprovoked, unjustified, unconscionable
[war]{.underline}" [has taken thousands of lives, destroyed much of
Ukraine's modern infrastructure and ancient landmarks, and created the
largest tidal wave of refugees in Europe since World War II. Yet amidst
all these horrors, there's a **flicker of hope**: The [NATO]{.mark}
alliance [is **more united** than]{.mark} at [any time since
9/11]{.mark} -- [and **more important** than]{.mark} at [any time since
11/9.]{.mark} This is the very opposite of what Putin
expected.]{.underline}

**[Common cause]{.underline}**

[Consider how the]{.underline} 30-member [alliance swiftly rejected
Putin's]{.underline} December [demands that NATO not expand to include
Ukraine, cease its deterrence operations in Eastern Europe and grant him
veto authority over the decisions of sovereign nations.
Then]{.underline}, as Putin massed more than 180,000 troops, hundreds of
tanks and dozens of warships on Ukraine's borders and coasts, [the
alliance set about the task of bolstering its easternmost
members.]{.underline}

The United States deployed B-52s to Britain; F-35s to Germany, Lithuania
and Estonia; F-15s to Poland and Estonia; F-16s to Romania; dozens of
AH-64 attack helicopters to the Baltics and Poland; Patriot air-defense
batteries and thousands of combat troops to Poland; an armored brigade
combat team of 7,000 soldiers to Germany; hundreds of troops to Hungary,
Bulgaria and Romania; and 800 combat troops to the Baltics. There are
now about 100,000 U.S. troops standing guard all across Europe.

In addition, Washington approved a long-delayed sale of 250 M1A2 tanks
to Poland, and surged the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman to join
carrier strike groups from Italy and France in a show of force in the
northern Mediterranean.

Britain has deployed hundreds of troops to Poland, sent warships to the
Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean, dispatched Challenger tanks to the
Baltics, doubled its troop commitment in Estonia, and based
fighter-bombers in Romania and Poland. Canada has deployed hundreds of
additional troops to augment its battlegroup in Latvia. Germany has sent
troops to reinforce its contingent in Lithuania. France has deployed
hundreds of troops to Romania. Germany and the Netherlands sent Patriot
batteries to Slovakia. Denmark rushed F-16s to Lithuania and sent a
frigate to the Baltic Sea. Dutch F-35s and Spanish Eurofighters deployed
to Bulgaria. NATO now has 130 warplanes on "high alert" in Central and
Eastern Europe, more than 200 ships forward-deployed in the waters of
the Arctic, North Atlantic, Baltic, Aegean, Adriatic and Mediterranean,
and tens of thousands of newly deployed or repositioned combat troops in
the region, according to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

[For the first time in history, NATO activated and deployed its
rapid-response force. And for just the second time in history,
Turkey]{.underline} -- acting under international authorities it was
granted by a 1936 treaty -- [closed the Black Sea to Russian
warships.]{.underline}

[NATO hasn't limited its response within its footprint. In
a]{.underline} ~~crippling~~ \[[crushing]{.underline}\] [blow to
Russia's economy, NATO members, the EU, Japan and other partners
disconnected Russian banks from SWIFT]{.underline}, the global messaging
system that enables financial transfers among 11,000 banks in 200
countries[. Britain, Canada and the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [joined the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and other partners in imposing "unprecedented export control measures"
to cut off Russia's access to high-tech products. The allies closed
their airspace to commercial and private Russian aircraft, seized
Russian assets, and cut off Putin's kleptocracy from the most of the
world.]{.underline}

Specific to Ukraine, before the invasion, the United States flew
reconnaissance flights over eastern and western Ukraine, shared
intelligence with Kiev, and formed an airbridge linking NATO bases with
Ukraine. This enabled delivery of defensive weapons from North America,
Britain and Europe.

When Russia started to fill Ukraine's skies with missiles and artillery,
NATO began delivering weapons overland. In the first six days of the
war, the alliance rushed 17,000 antitank weapons into Ukraine. The
United States has shipped tons of small-arms ammunition, mortar and
artillery shells, Javelin antitank systems, Stinger anti-aircraft
systems, and grenade launchers. Britain has delivered 3,615 antitank
systems, as well as Starstreak antiaircraft missiles. The Baltic nations
have sent antiaircraft missiles and antitank systems. Poland sent
antiaircraft weapons. Turkey has delivered ground-attack drones. In a
stunning reversal, Germany rushed 2,000 antitank weapons and 500
surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. Non-NATO member Sweden delivered
5,000 antitank systems to Ukraine's gallant defenders.

Challenges

[Even so, Putin's war on Ukraine has exposed challenges within
NATO.]{.underline} The most glaring of these revolve around Germany --
namely, Berlin's equivocation over the future of the Russia-to-Germany
Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline and Berlin's decision to block delivery of
German-built weapons to Ukraine. These policies prompted some observers
to ask those eternal questions: "Is NATO broken, and is it worth the
trouble?"

The answer to that first question is found in the above paragraphs. It's
impossible to read Putin's mind, but the rapidity and unity of NATO's
response surely came as a surprise to the Russian strongman. Indeed,
NATO's response the past 70 days represents the very opposite of what
happened when Putin mounted his first invasion of Ukraine in 2014.

[The fact that NATO didn't prevent Putin from moving against [Ukraine
**isn't a NATO failure**; it's]{.mark} a function of the **harsh
geopolitical reality** [that Ukraine is not a member]{.mark} of the most
important, most enduring security alliance in history.]{.underline} To
be sure, [Europe will be more stable -- and NATO more secure -- if
Ukraine can somehow remain a sovereign, democratically oriented nation.
That explains why the alliance worked so hard on the diplomatic and
military front to make Putin think twice about this criminal
invasion.]{.underline}

[However, [the]{.mark} central [purpose]{.mark} of NATO [is to
deter]{.mark} an [attack against]{.mark} its **[members]{.mark}** and,
if necessary, to defend its members from attack.]{.underline} Indeed,
[the fact [that Putin]{.mark} has [attacked Ukraine **while keeping his
hands off**]{.mark} **NATO [members]{.mark}** Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania
and Poland [underscores]{.mark} that **he respects [NATO's]{.mark}
all-for-one [security guarantee -- at least for
now.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In these weeks of war, Ukraine has shown itself to be a nation of
warriors and a worthy ally. Its Churchillian leader and courageous
people have earned NATO's respect -- and if they survive the hell Putin
has unleashed, a seat at NATO's table. But Russia\'s sheer mass could be
enough to overwhelm Ukraine, especially as Putin employs the beastly
scorched-earth tactics he perfected in Chechnya and Syria.

Headaches

[As to whether the alliance is worth the headaches and heartburn it
causes -- especially for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[-- the answer to that question is found in both the historical record
and today's headlines.]{.underline}

To be sure, Germany's prewar resistance to sending defensive weapons to
Ukraine frustrated its NATO allies, and Germany\'s dependence on
Russia's natural gas has proven to be shortsighted. But it pays to
recall that [NATO overcame **far more worrisome internal challenges in
the past**. Consider the Anglo-French deceptions during the Suez crisis
in]{.underline} 19[56, France throwing out NATO's headquarters and
pulling out of NATO's integrated military command in]{.underline}
1966-19[67, open hostilities between Turkey and Greece in
the]{.underline} 19[70s and]{.underline} 19[80s, and France and Germany
waging a diplomatic war against the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Britain in]{.underline} 2002-20[03 over Iraq's
repeated violations of U.N. Security Council resolutions.]{.underline}

[In spite of all of that, NATO **repeatedly proves its importance** to
America's security. Too many Americans forget or simply don't know that
[NATO is a **force-multiplier for U.S. power**, a **bridge to global
hotspots**, a **backstop against great-power war**]{.mark} **in
Europe**, [and a]{.mark} ready-made [structure where]{.mark} like-minded
[nations]{.mark} with shared values and high levels of military
interoperability **[build coalitions]{.mark}** to defend their freedom
and interests. These alliances within [the alliance helped]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[**liberate Kuwait**, **defend
Saudi Arabia**,]{.mark} **wage war and [keep peace in the
Balkans]{.mark}**[, **avenge 9/11**, **topple Saddam**]{.mark}**'s
regime** [and **respond to COVID**]{.mark}**-19**.]{.underline}

Moreover, Germany has now suspended Nord Stream 2. As noted, Germany has
rushed thousands of weapons systems to Ukraine. And in a truly
remarkable about-face, Germany is increasing its annual defense outlays
to 2% of GDP (something Washington and NATO have been begging Berlin to
do since 2006), creating a \$112.7 billion modernization and rearmament
fund, and building a strategic LNG reserve and new LNG terminals.

"The world," German Chancellor Olaf Scholz concludes, "will no longer be
the same as the world before." Or perhaps more accurately, [Europe and
the world are returning to what they were before 11/9, when the Berlin
Wall collapsed.]{.underline}

**[Insurance]{.underline}**

[Throughout the post-Cold War period, [the alliance served as an
**insurance policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [just in case Moscow reverted
to its old ways. And here we are.]{.underline}

[Insurance is a good way to understand NATO. Insurance]{.underline},
after all, [is about providing protection [against **worst-case
scenarios**.]{.mark} Prudent people hope they never have to use
insurance]{.underline}, [but they realize that paying a little each
month or each year protects them against having to pay a lot -- or
losing everything -- if disaster strikes. The same is true in the realm
of international security.]{.underline}

[The deterrent represented by Article V]{.underline} of the North
Atlantic Treaty [serves as **insurance against worst-case scenarios**.
For America, [NATO is a hedge against]{.mark} **another European
conflict** triggering **another [continentwide or worldwide
war]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} For NATO's other members, NATO is a security
guarantee backed by America. **[Without that guarantee, there's no
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as history has a way of reminding those
on the outside looking in, from Cold War Hungary to post-Cold War
Ukraine.

[Like all insurance policies, there are costs associated with
NATO.]{.underline} A recent study revealed that U.S. defense
expenditures earmarked for Europe amount to \$36 billion per year.
That's not a trivial amount of American taxpayers' money. [But consider
what America gets in exchange for that insurance premium: a **hedge
against another Argonne or Normandy**, a Europe **reinforced against
invasion**, and **economic benefits** that exponentially exceed those
premium costs.]{.underline}

[With Putin trying to reconstitute the Russian Empire and reverse the
settled outcomes of Cold War I, NATO is **proving its worth yet again**.
As]{.underline} Gen. James [Mattis puts it, "If we did not have NATO
today, we would need to create it."]{.underline}

#### The [NATO Innovation Fund]{.underline} (NIF) and [defense innovation accelerator]{.underline} (DIANA) are [good first steps]{.underline}, but [additional U.S. support]{.underline} is key to [actualize]{.underline} their benefits.

[[The]{.mark} Defense Innovation [Accelerator and]{.mark} NATO
Innovation [Fund]{.mark}]{.underline} announced at the NATO Summit [are
welcome developments]{.underline}, [but they [require **new
authorities** and **differentiated talent**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Swift tech]{.underline}nological [change has meant governments and the
military created new organizations and approaches to innovation and
rapid acquisition. Unfortunately, many do not have the necessary
authority, budget, or workforce to succeed]{.underline}, [meaning that
meaningful change and impact have been sacrificed for theater.
[For]{.mark}]{.underline} the newly announced Defense Innovation
Accelerator North Atlantic ([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- with
planned locations in Toronto and Cambridge, UK -- [[and
the]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO Innovation Fund
([[NIF]{.underline}]{.mark}) [to succeed, they [must address **authority
and budget concerns**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} then [bring in
the right personnel to lead and staff them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Authorities

[There are three key authorities that NATO must get right for DIANA and
NIF: reporting lines, patience]{.underline} (or willingness to accept
failure)[, and decision making.]{.underline}

\* First, [DIANA and NIF should operate independently with a direct line
into the most senior decision-makers]{.underline} (the Secretary
General, SACEUR, Supreme Allied Commander Transformation --- SACT, etc).

\* Second, [they need to be allowed to fail. The most impactful defense
organizations]{.underline} (and indeed commercial organizations,
particularly in the startup world) [normalize taking big
bets]{.underline}, [with the knowledge that many will likely
fail]{.underline}, [and even the ones that succeed may take years to
realize their full impact.]{.underline}

\* Third and finally, [these new NATO bodies need to invest in or
provide support to initiatives and startups without requiring external
permission or consensus.]{.underline} At the same time, [[they]{.mark}
also [need a clear transition partner for promising capabilities to be
handed off to (**e.g. DARPA**]{.mark} **transitioning tech [to
the]{.mark} U.S. [D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense[**[)]{.mark}**, which can move from
development to deployment. [This will enable the Alliance to]{.mark}
more readily [**identify**, **develop**, and **deploy** e]{.mark}merging
and [d]{.mark}isruptive
[t]{.mark}ech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[[Similar efforts including]{.mark} the U.S. D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense['s [DARPA and
D]{.mark}]{.underline}efense [[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nit[[,]{.mark} CIA's [In-Q-Tel, and]{.mark}
USAF's [S]{.mark}trategic [C]{.mark}apabilities
[O]{.mark}ffice]{.underline}, [[are effective]{.mark} because they exist
outside of traditional bureaucracies, leverage non-traditional talent
strategies, and have consistent budgets.]{.underline}

Budget

Allocating funding seems obvious, but too often limited forethought is
given to this issue. [To ensure success, organizational [funding must be
**significant**, **multi-year**, and **consistent**]{.mark} or include
inbuilt annual growth. A number of high-potential initiatives have
either been announced with no dedicated funding or have had sizable
funding gaps in subsequent years damaging their brand and relationships
with defense companies and startups alike. The NIF]{.underline} in
particular [will likely rely on the willingness of Alliance members to
make contributions beyond other NATO obligations. If so, **multi-year
commitments are crucial**]{.underline}, [as are success
metrics]{.underline}, [such as r]{.underline}eturn [o]{.underline}n
[i]{.underline}nvestment, [which are rarely used within NATO or national
government departments.]{.underline}

Talent

Finally, and most overlooked, is getting talent right. External talent
is crucial. It is not enough to simply construct new organizations
staffed in the traditional manner. [To realize their full potential,
[NATO must attract talent with startup and/or]{.mark}]{.underline}
venture capital ([[VC]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[experience]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and pair them with top
subject-matter experts from R&D communities]{.underline}, [both
government]{.underline}, [and commercial. [This cannot be done with
NATO's current Byzantine]{.mark}, long, drawn-out hiring
[process]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which can last six months or even
longer]{.underline}, [and advantage insiders versus external
candidates.]{.underline} As such the Alliance must engage and attract
this talent. [The good news is [NATO has]{.mark} a number of potential
[examples to draw on for]{.mark} potential [hiring pathways.]{.mark} In
the U.S. [the D]{.mark}efense [D]{.mark}igital [S]{.mark}ervice
[hires]{.mark} design and technical [experts for]{.mark} one-to-two
"[tours of duty]{.mark}," using their skillsets and operate outside the
traditional civil service.]{.underline} In the UK, strategy and
technology professionals are seconded into the Ministry of Defence, the
Department of Trade, and intelligence organizations such as GCHQ, to
provide experience or skills that may not exist within the current civil
service workforce.

But providing pathways alone is not enough: attracting this talent to
apply and convincing them to join is just as important. This requires
identifying areas where they might work, including industry, academia,
and startups, and VC. At the same time, other steps are needed.
Upskilling existing NATO civilians -- among the international and
international military staff (IS and IMS) --- and Alliance service
members are needed to address this skill and understanding gap. To do
so, it is helpful to expose them to startup and VC environments.
Programs like Shift's Defense Ventures Program in the U.S. have
succeeded in building understanding between the Department of Defense's
civilian and military workforce and startups and VCs. They've done so by
bringing in high-performing defense personnel for eight-week immersions
with growing venture-backed startups or VC firms. This cultivates the
necessary connective tissue between startups, VCs, and the military.
NATO could readily follow a similar process by providing its highest
performers the opportunity to temporarily work alongside leading North
American and European startups and investors.

What's Next?

[Accelerating the development, deployment, and integration of emerging
and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [into the strategic and
tactical environments is at the core of future NATO operations. The
Alliance's move to build [DIANA and NIF]{.mark}]{.underline}, [along
with incorporating the right language into strategic documents are
**significant first steps**. But building these initiatives from scratch
will require **significant planning** to establish the right
**authorities**, **budget**, and **talent environment** to enable these
organizations to thrive. In order to do so, they [need to build
**outside of traditional NATO structures and models**]{.mark} while
creating a differentiated talent and organizational
culture.]{.underline}

#### [Specifically]{.underline}, increased [U.S. security cooperation with NATO]{.underline} is vital to NIF and DIANA effectiveness.

4\. [The US should help NATO create **R&D centers** and **defense
innovation hubs** to harness emerging technologies being developed by
allies.]{.underline}

As was noted in the NATO 2030 Reflection Group, [[China is making
**rapid advancements**]{.mark} in telecom]{.underline}munications[,
space, cyberspace, and other new tech]{.underline}nologies [with the
intent [to be the world leader]{.mark} in AI by 2030 and the world's
leading global tech]{.underline}nological [superpower by
2049.]{.underline}96 [[In response, NATO]{.mark} issued its 2030 Agenda
that [seeks to **increase**]{.mark} **NATO [transatlantic innovation and
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological [[**edge** while
**preventing**]{.mark} **innovation [gaps]{.mark}** among
allies.]{.underline}97 Moreover, [the NATO Advisory Group
on]{.underline} Emerging and Disruptive Technologies ([EDT]{.underline})
[issued a]{.underline} 2020 [report citing pathways for NATO to become
an EDT-ready organization, recommending that NATO establish **a network
of innovation centers** \[or defense innovation hubs\] throughout NATO
with funding to match.]{.underline}98

[As a result, during the]{.underline} 14 Jun [2021 Brussels summit, NATO
issued a communique announcing the establishment of a [N]{.mark}ATO
[I]{.mark}nnovation [F]{.mark}und to promote transatlantic startups
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} a Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North
Atlantic ([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark})[. Since DIANA [is intended to be
NATO's version of]{.mark} the US]{.underline} Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency ([[DARPA]{.underline}]{.mark})[[, **the US is
in**]{.mark} **a very good [position to promote]{.mark} transatlantic
[coordination]{.mark}** on **AI**, big-data processing, quantum-enabled
tech]{.underline}nologies[, autonomy, **biotech**]{.underline}nology[,
hypersonic weapons, and space.]{.underline}99 In addition, [[the US
could **support the Innovation Hub** by helping **pre-vet investors**
to]{.mark} ensure allied tech]{.underline}nology [would be
[protect]{.mark}ed [from **illicit transfers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}"100

Accordingly, [[the US should]{.mark} support NATO by [help]{.mark}ing
**[create R&D centers and]{.mark} defense innovation [hubs]{.mark}**
[that could **better harness emerging
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [to support NATO allies.
[These]{.mark} centers and hubs [would]{.mark} help **[accelerate
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology [[and **improve
coop**]{.mark}**eration [among]{.mark} NATO allies and partners** and
would heavily rely on **partnerships** with academia, researchers,
industry, and start-ups.]{.underline}101 [[Linked]{.mark} to these NATO
centers and hubs [would be **universities**,
**commercial**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end page 24\] [[**sector**, and
**allied**]{.mark} **countries' [org]{.mark}anization[s]{.mark}** that
accelerate tech]{.underline}nology [into the hands of the warfighter.
For example, [the US has]{.mark} several organizations, such as
**DARPA**, **Defense Innovation Unit**, **AFWERX**, **SPACEWERX**,
**Army Futures Command** and **NavalX**]{.underline}, [t[hat could
**coordinate closely**]{.mark} **with NATO centers and hubs** [to
collaborate]{.mark} on **similar problem sets and
solutions**.]{.underline}

[Another important facet of these NATO centers and hubs is assessing how
the tech]{.underline}nology [will impact NATO's ability to **jointly
fight** in the future. [The]{.mark} NATO R&D [Center would need to be
**linked** to]{.mark} NATO's [A]{.mark}llied [C]{.mark}ommand
[T]{.mark}ransformation in]{.underline} Norfolk, [Virginia]{.underline},
[[to **identify**]{.mark} **potential [impacts]{.mark}** of the
tech]{.underline}nology [[on]{.mark} NATO's **[war-fighting]{.mark}
capabilities**.]{.underline} Accordingly, [[the US should **work
closely**]{.mark} **with NATO allies** [to ensure **integration** and
**interoperability**]{.mark} with these new
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}102

#### U.S. [expertise]{.underline} and [capabilities]{.underline} are key to quickly get required tech to the battlefield --- U.S. cooperation will [streamline]{.underline} NATO's innovation pipeline.

In a Feb. 26 Twitter post, Mykhailo Fedorov, [Ukraine's vice prime
minister]{.underline} and minister for digital transformation,
[asked]{.underline} the [SpaceX]{.underline} chief executive, Elon Musk,
[to provide Ukraine with Starlink terminals to enable satellite-based
communications. In less than 48 hours, Starlink user kits arrived in
Ukraine, immediately improving the command-and-control ability of
Ukraine's military.]{.underline}

[For those]{.underline} of us [who study the NATO acquisition process,
it is almost **impossible** to imagine the alliance identifying a
requirement and adopting a solution so quickly]{.underline}, [**no
matter how urgent the circumstances**. Among the many challenges would
be the alliance's elaborate, consensus-based governing
structure]{.underline}, [as well as the divergent interests and funding
mechanisms among the 30 member states. This is why]{.underline}, in
2016, [the International Board of Auditors concluded that NATO struggles
to provide commanders with required capabilities **on time** and
estimated that common-funded capabilities required an average of 16
years from development to delivery.]{.underline}

[The [complexity]{.mark} of modern weapons systems [and]{.mark} the
[challenges of interoperability mean]{.mark} that [any]{.mark} active
[engagement will lead to]{.mark} the [identification of new
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nical [[requirements]{.mark} for NATO. The
alliance needs **the processes and structures in place** to **rapidly**
identify these requirements and procure solutions.]{.underline} This
includes giving commanders the authority to make decisions without the
lengthy consensus-building approach that may be reasonable, if slow, in
peacetime but is not effective during war.

First Steps

[NATO **has** previously sought to improve the governance, speed, and
efficiency of its capability-delivery process. For example,]{.underline}
in 2018 [NATO adopted a new governance model for common-funded
capabilities. It has undertaken efforts to enhance collaboration between
strategic commands]{.underline} (Allied Command Operations in Mons,
Belgium and Allied Command Transformation in Norfolk, VA)[, called for
the exploration of alternative acquisition strategies to support
tech]{.underline}nology [development, and created the Office of the
C]{.underline}hief [I]{.underline}nformation [O]{.underline}fficer [to
accelerate the delivery of computer and info]{.underline}rmation
[systems.]{.underline} Furthermore, in October 2021 [NATO launched
[the]{.mark} first]{.underline} \$1.1 billion **[[Innovation
Fund]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} last month
[announced the creation of the first ever **Defense Innovation
[Accelerator]{.mark}** for the North Atlantic to harness cutting-edge
tech]{.underline}nologies as part of the NATO 2030 agenda.

[These are **valuable steps**]{.underline}, [[but they do **not**
address the **fundamental challenge** of rapidly acquiring common
capabilities.]{.mark} There are still many residual processes where
consensus-based control is inherently prioritized over speed,
flexibility, innovation, and the deployment of prototypes at the end of
their development phases.]{.underline}

[NATO leaders recognize the ongoing challenge.]{.underline} In a recent
speech to the North Atlantic Council, the supreme allied commander
transformation, Gen. Philippe Lavigne, stressed that one of his key
priorities is to ensure the timely delivery of new and critical
capabilities, adding that "we need to change the rules and make them
work for us, not against us." [But [NATO leaders **cannot** fix this
**alone** --- the]{.mark} alliance's **30 [member nations]{.mark}** are
the ones that will [**have to agree on the
solution**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Exploring alternatives and getting the
allies to agree on a solution will be difficult. It can happen on a
NATO-wide basis, or some subset of member nations can take on the
challenge and lead the effort, which may then be adopted by others.

What Works

[Access to adequate funding is a necessary starting point]{.underline},
[and NATO has a track record of funding common
capabilities.]{.underline} In 2021, NATO was implementing over 3,000
common-funded projects, worth approximately \$17 billion (of which the
United States funds about 22 percent). These include providing critical
technology that supports the planning and execution of all NATO air
operations, and the Air Situation Data Exchange that enhances
situational awareness at NATO's borders with partner nations, including
Ukraine.

[But the capability-fielding process is still subject to
delays]{.underline}, [which would be dangerous when addressing needs
identified during combat operations.]{.underline} To avoid this,
alliance members should commit to providing funds for a
rapid-acquisition organization on a preauthorized and discretionary
basis, in essence creating a bank account that can be drawn upon when
needed. Even if this were a credit line that members committed to,
rather than a standing pot of funds, it would limit setbacks caused by
the slow and political processes of identifying and appropriating
funding.

[Ensuring adequate funding is not the only answer. Commanders also need
the authority to streamline the identification of urgent needs and a
standing mechanism]{.underline}, not an ad hoc approach, [that can
provide the flexibility and authority to address them.]{.underline} This
exists for some alliance members on a national basis. The commander of
the Dutch Defense Materiel Organization's Computer Emergency Response
Team, for example, has a pre-authorized budget and the power to expedite
acquisitions of up to 500,000 euros for urgent cyber capabilities within
14 days. However, there is no NATO-wide approach.

[[The]{.mark} **U.S. [D]{.mark}**]{.underline}epartment
**[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f **[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
[[offers]{.mark} a variety of [acquisition approaches]{.mark} that
[**NATO could draw from**.]{.mark} The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has a model where the military services are
largely responsible for acquiring weapon systems and providing them to
the joint force commanders. There are also several
D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
[organizations that have been stood up to address cross-service
challenges. This means that there are both joint department-wide and
service-level acquisition organizations procuring materiel to serve as
examples.]{.underline}

[Over time]{.underline}, [the D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f
[D]{.underline}efense [has developed processes [to allow requirements
identified on the battlefield to be **quickly addressed**.]{.mark}
Different parts of the department have also embarked on different forms
of organizational innovation.]{.underline}

[[One example is the Air Force's R]{.mark}apid [C]{.mark}apabilities
[O]{.mark}ffice]{.underline}, [which was formed]{.underline} in 2003 [to
"expedite important]{.underline}, [often classified programs while
keeping them on budget."]{.underline} The office has a unique management
structure --- it reports to a board of directors that is chaired by the
undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment and includes
the most senior leaders of the Air Force and the under secretary of
defense for research and engineering. These senior leaders can both set
priorities for spending and work to find the necessary funding.
Furthermore, [acquisition experts at the Rapid Capabilities Office are
carefully selected to maintain a culture [where]{.mark} "**lean**,
[**agile**, and **forward-looking** tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
[[development" is possible.]{.underline}]{.mark} Along with the Air
Force's new stealth bomber, the B-21 Raider, the office oversees the
X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, "an experimental test program to demonstrate
technologies for a reliable, reusable, unmanned space test platform."
The effectiveness of the Rapid Capabilities Office is affirmed by the
decision to put these two extremely important programs there rather than
within more traditional Air Force acquisition organizations.

[Another concept comes from [the D]{.mark}]{.underline}efense
[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nit, [which
[was designed to]{.mark} work across the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [to [identify]{.mark} and
understand [critical]{.mark} national security [challenges that can be
solved with]{.mark} leading-edge [commercial
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [within 12 to 24 months. The
D]{.underline}efense [[I]{.underline}nnovation [U]{.underline}nit
[connects with non]{.underline}]{.mark}[-traditional suppliers [in
**innovation hubs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including Silicon
Valley]{.underline}, [and uses flexible acquisition models to issue
contracts in as little as 2 to 3 months.]{.underline} It then publishes
a catalog of commercial "solutions" ready for purchase from a range of
companies, many of whom are not traditional defense suppliers. These
include the Next Gen Explosive Ordnance Disposal Underwater Response
Vehicle, a remotely operated underwater vehicle that searches for mines,
and Hunt Forward, a set of tools for forward-deployed cyber operations.
Although implementation has not always been smooth, [the
D]{.underline}efense [I]{.underline}nnovation [U]{.underline}nit
[has]{.underline} nonetheless [provided battlefield commanders with **a
range of innovative solutions** that they can turn to.]{.underline}

[The R]{.underline}apid [C]{.underline}apabilities [O]{.underline}ffice
[empowers its leadership to finalize requirements and rapidly commit
funding, a crucial component of its success. The D]{.underline}efense
[I]{.underline}nnovation [U]{.underline}nit [focuses on creating a
pipeline of new tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline} And [these
organizations are not unique. There are others across the
services]{.underline}, [such as [**NAVALX**, the **Army Applications
Lab**, and **AFWERX**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that are aimed at
[adapt]{.mark}ing [innovations]{.mark} from both traditional and
non-traditional suppliers.]{.underline} The United Kingdom's Royal Air
Force has its own Rapid Capabilities Office, which has also shown
promise.

[These [**U.S. models** prove]{.mark} that [a bureaucracy]{.mark} as
[resistant to change]{.mark} as the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [[can still develop]{.mark} new
organizational [structures and processes.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Dutch
and British models show that attempts at organizational innovation are
not limited to the Pentagon. [NATO]{.underline} may choose to adapt one
of these or to develop its own unique approaches. The goal
[should]{.underline} be to [provide its commanders with the flexibility
and the authority to "validate requirements" ---]{.underline} that is,
[to formally approve what the warfighter needs to execute the fight ---
and to make resources available.]{.underline} The decision structure
could be a small rotating board of senior leaders, perhaps with time
limits for approving or rejecting requirements to force rapid decisions.

[[NATO]{.mark} also [needs]{.mark} a way [to connect with **industry
partners**]{.mark} **across the alliance**, capitalizing on innovations
from small businesses and startups using new and flexible contracting
mechanisms. [The alliance]{.mark} currently [lacks]{.mark} the [tools to
**rapidly adopt commercial
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[**[.]{.mark}** Two related policies
would help to enhance the ability of new tech]{.underline}nologies [to
connect with existing systems. To increase operational effectiveness,
[NATO should leverage **interoperability standards**]{.mark} that allow
different systems to operate seamlessly in a multi-domain environment. A
related approach would be to adopt **open systems architecture
approaches** for NATO weapons. This would provide design
info]{.underline}rmation [to companies for developing components that
could work with existing systems [using a "**plug and play**"
approach.]{.mark} Both of these policies would build upon the
traditional NATO strength of developing standards while making these
standards relevant to innovative companies.]{.underline}

[All these process changes and organizational innovations will take
**effort** --- and the journey may be slowed by NATO's
consensus-building culture. Transformation takes time]{.underline}, [but
it only begins when there is a clear case for change. The scale and
scope of Russia's attack on Ukraine provides that case]{.underline},
[and the delivery of Starlink provides an example of what could be
possible if NATO had a more flexible approach to
acquisitions.]{.underline}

#### [Integrating]{.underline} the U.S. and NATO's [EDT innovation networks]{.underline} is key to [burden-sharing]{.underline} and [interoperability]{.underline} --- allies "say yes."

commercial tech]{.underline}nology [sector. Intended as a workaround to
a sclerotic defense acquisitions process, DIUx came to rely on an
obscure contracting authority to rapidly award prototype projects to
innovative companies ― a welcome change to the Pentagon business models
that never managed to align with the tech]{.underline}nology [industry's
far faster pace.]{.underline}

[By the end of the Obama admin]{.underline}istration, [DIUx]{.underline}
had [expanded beyond Silicon Valley to]{.underline} two other U.S.
innovation hubs --- [Boston and Austin.]{.underline}

Growth gave way to uncertainty following the 2016 presidential election,
with observers questioning whether the new team would support DIUx, and
Congress moving to restrict its access to funding. Since then, however,
DIUx has won the support of key stakeholders. Secretary of Defense Jim
Mattis visited DIUx in mid-2017 and offered an unequivocal endorsement
of its mission to "accelerate commercial innovation to the war fighter."
Michael Griffin, the new undersecretary of defense for research and
engineering, has also expressed backing for DIUx, which falls within his
portfolio.

Congress has warmed somewhat to DIUx, though whether it will fund the
White House's requested plus-up remains uncertain. And DIUx has
demonstrated its ability to do more than fund prototypes ― transitioning
two projects into production contracts by the end of 2017.

[Engaging commercial tech]{.underline}nology [companies in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will ― and should ― remain the
primary focus of]{.underline} the next [DIUx]{.underline} managing
director[. However, with DIUx now on more solid political and
bureaucratic footing, there is a unique opportunity to **broaden its
horizons**.]{.underline}

[[Taking DIUx global could]{.mark} deliver multiple advantages. U.S.
commercial tech]{.underline}nology [companies do not hold a monopoly on
innovations relevant to solving vexing military challenges.]{.underline}
For example, Israel is a leading global provider of counter-drone
solutions. [A more internationally oriented DIUx could [improve]{.mark}
the [U.S.]{.mark} military's [access to
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [generated by companies located on the
soil [of]{.mark} its [allies and partners]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.mark} simultaneously enable their governments to [more
effectively harvest U.S.]{.mark} commercial
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [for national defense
needs.]{.underline}

[Many U.S. [allies]{.mark} and partners [would **welcome the
opportunity**]{.mark} **to plug into DIUx**]{.underline}, [given the
diverse threats they confront ― from rising regional powers to terrorist
networks ― and constraints on the resources they can dedicate to
defense. At the political level, [cooperation]{.mark} around DIUx
[could]{.mark} help **[strengthen]{.mark} America's [alliances]{.mark}
and partnerships** at a time of uncertainty]{.underline},
[[while]{.mark} also **[bolstering]{.mark} future military
[interoperability]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Looking ahead, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will need
to identify **new and innovative ways to share the burden** with its
allies and partners to maintain its tech]{.underline}nological
[advantage.]{.underline} Although the Pentagon will see a budget
increase over the next two years, without legislative action, mandated
budget cuts will return in 2020. [[A more international]{.mark}ly
oriented [DIUx could]{.mark} help to **[spread the costs of
r]{.mark}**]{.underline}esearch **[[and
d]{.underline}]{.mark}**evelopment[[.]{.mark} Over the long
term]{.underline}, [[it could]{.mark} even [evolve into the
**cornerstone** of a **commercial innovation-oriented defense
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [**[network]{.mark}** spanning the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and
partners.]{.underline}

[[With traditional]{.mark} forms of **[security cooperation]{.mark}**
like large-scale r]{.underline}esearch [and d]{.underline}evelopment
[projects and f]{.underline}oreign [m]{.underline}ilitary
[s]{.underline}ales [[failing to keep pace]{.mark} with a rapidly
evolving threat environment, such [a network could]{.mark} enable the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and partners to
**[more effectively address shared]{.mark} national security
[challenges]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[DIUx has taken limited steps to engage U.S. allies and
partners.]{.underline} On the government side, these include welcoming a
United Kingdom liaison officer and, reportedly, plans to host an Indian
military representative. DIUx has also worked with a handful of foreign
commercial technology firms.

[Yet]{.underline}, beyond these initial steps, [significant opportunity
exists.]{.underline} To take DIUx global, the next managing director
could pursue multiple, mutually reinforcing options.

The easiest would be for personnel from DIUx and the military services
to conduct a series of roadshows to U.S. allies and partners. These
roadshows would serve a dual purpose: to showcase the portfolio of U.S.
firms that work with DIUx and to raise the awareness of DIUx among
overseas companies that typically do not consider the Pentagon as a
potential customer.

[A]{.underline} second [option would be to establish offices overseas in
order [to **embed DIUx in key ally**]{.mark} **and partner [innovation
hubs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These offices could take various forms ―
from a handful of DIUx personnel based in a U.S. embassy to a
bilaterally staffed organization funded in part by the host nation.

[DIUx offices overseas [could function as points of coordination]{.mark}
across U.S. alliances and partnerships]{.underline}, supporting efforts
like the "Five Eyes" Technical Cooperation Program, [but focus on
tech]{.underline}nologies [emerging out of the commercial sector in
addition to national lab]{.underline}oratorie[s.]{.underline} Some key
considerations for selecting a location would include a high density of
companies working on cutting-edge technologies with national security
relevance; commitment by ally and partner militaries to leverage
technology developed in the commercial sector; and willingness of ally
and partner governments to put up resources.

A third option would be to launch [dedicated [funds]{.mark} under DIUx
with financing contributed [from **both** the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[**[and]{.mark}** its [allies]{.mark} and partners]{.underline} to solve
joint challenges. Each fund would focus on awarding prototype projects
to companies with potential solutions to the challenge identified. This
option [[would]{.mark} allow the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies and partners to **[share]{.mark}
defense [resources]{.mark}**[; provide **more revenue to**]{.mark}
**national security-relevant [startups]{.mark}** than the Pentagon could
on its own; [and **build interoperability up
front**.]{.mark}]{.underline} A clear area for such a fund would be
low-cost intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance coverage over a
vast maritime area ― a challenge that has long bedeviled the United
States and Australia in the Indo-Pacific region.

The next managing director of DIUx will have an unparalleled opportunity
to take it global. But she or he will need a mandate to do so ― ideally
from the secretary of defense. With that mandate, the next managing
director should quickly move to advance an ambitious agenda for
involving allies and partners more closely in the work of DIUx.
[[Announcing]{.mark} that [DIUx will open]{.mark} an office overseas
within a year [would]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [**[galvanize
ally]{.mark} and partner [interest]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### 1AC --- Plan

#### The United States federal government should substantially increase its security cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to strengthen defense innovation hubs and research and development in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and cybersecurity, including by substantially increasing its support for and participation in the NATO Innovation Fund and Defense Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic. 

### 1AC --- Alliance Fragmentation Advantage

#### [Contention Two: Alliance Fragmentation]{.underline}

[To stay secure, [the transatlantic community must take on
e]{.mark}merging and [d]{.mark}isruptive
[t]{.mark}ech]{.underline}nologies [**[together]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Today's transatlantic security hinges on tech]{.underline}nology[. On
both sides of the Atlantic, our militaries, societies, economies, and
info]{.underline}rmation [systems require increasingly advanced
tech]{.underline}nologies [[to stay **better**, **faster**, and
**stronger** than]{.mark} our [adversaries]{.mark} and competitors. To
retain their advantage and address vulnerabilities, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Europe must **work in
lockstep** to harness emerging and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies
[for their collective defense. [The key is to employ **NATO** and
the]{.mark}]{.underline} European Union ([[EU]{.underline}]{.mark})
[**[in unison]{.mark}** for strategic effect.]{.underline}

[NATO, the EU, and their member states have recognized the urgent need
to combine their complementary capabilities to contest Russia and
China]{.underline}, [especially in the tech]{.underline}nological
[domain.]{.underline} Just yesterday, [[NATO]{.mark} Secretary General
Stoltenberg [announced a]{.mark} new a [D]{.mark}efense
[I]{.mark}nnovation [I]{.mark}nitiative "to promote interoperability and
boost transatlantic cooperation on defense innovation" among allies --
21 of which are members of both NATO and the EU. NATO and the EU also
share an overlapping set of forces, capabilities, talent,
i]{.underline}ntellectual [p]{.underline}roperty[, and budgets for
defense investment and]{.underline} research and development
([R&D]{.underline})[. Under the 2016 Joint Declaration, [practical
NATO-EU coop]{.mark}eration [has been humming
along]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[despite **lingering political
obstacles**.]{.mark} Applying]{.underline} emerging and disruptive
technologies ([EDT]{.underline}), [such as]{.underline} artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.underline})[, autonomous systems, space
capabilities, hypersonics, quantum tech, and human
augmentation]{.underline}, [for defense has been a key focus area. This
has been underscored by]{.underline}, for example, [jointly supported
workshops at the]{.underline} European Center of Excellence for
Countering Hybrid Threats ([Hybrid COE]{.underline}) [and NATO-EU senior
military staff talks. As each organization has made EDT advances,
staff-level coordination and broad info]{.underline}rmation [sharing
have helped to better align their efforts. For instance, NATO's EDT
roadmap team, Innovation Hub, and Science and Tech]{.underline}nology
[Organization have engaged with the]{.underline} European Defense Agency
([EDA]{.underline})['s tech work.]{.underline}

[[**But staff-level coordination** can only bear **so much
fruit**]{.mark} in the absence of a **more robust political effort**. As
strategic and tech]{.underline}nological [competition with Russia and
China has intensified, [the stakes have risen **too high** to settle for
**incremental activities**. Avoiding the political battles required to
forge a **more meaningful joint NATO-EU approach**, nations have begun
exploring **other transatlantic forums**]{.mark} to address EDT issues.
The Canadian and French-led Global Partnership on AI, the U.S.-led AI
Partnership for Defense, and the European Commission's proposed
Transatlantic T]{.underline}ech and [T]{.underline}rade
[C]{.underline}ouncil [are a few examples. Each of these platforms is
useful in its own right, specifically for AI issues, and could benefit
from NATO and the EU joining to add their institutional weight. The risk
with this approach]{.underline}, however, [is **the rapid fragmentation
of transatlantic efforts on EDT**. If this trend continues, [the result
could be **a diffused smattering of multilateral
frameworks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [each focused on a **particular tech
issue** with a **different small group** of countries.]{.underline}

[By opting for **outside platforms**, the transatlantic community misses
the point. [The **added value** of NATO and the EU is their ability to
**coordinate**]{.mark} **efforts** among **large groups** of like-minded
nations. [Both]{.mark} institutions [have]{.mark} a great deal of
[**experience** and **infrastructure**]{.mark} for doing so. [On]{.mark}
a [transformative]{.mark} set of [issues that require]{.mark}s [a
**comprehensive approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such as the defense
application of EDT, [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and the EU have the
capacity to make **an enormous collective impact**.]{.mark} Instead of
**scattering across alternative forums**, interested [member nations
must]{.mark} find ways to drive their EDT [work **through a new NATO-EU
mechanism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Launching [an EU-NATO Strategic Dialogue on EDT could]{.underline} be an
important option to explore. Routine, higher-level meetings in this
format would [draw together senior representatives from each
institution]{.underline}, [as well as member states and the private
sector --- each of which plays vital roles in assessing vulnerabilities
and shaping requirements for EDT. [The scope should expand]{.mark}
beyond AI alone [to encompass]{.mark} consultations on the wider
security implications of EDT.]{.underline} Tentative [agenda items could
include **forging key principles for [tech governance]{.mark} around the
military applications of EDT**; addressing **[data-sharing]{.mark}
issues**; [coordinating]{.mark} **defense [R&D and investment]{.mark}
incentives**; [and]{.mark} establishing **more robust standards and
technical requirements** for EDT-enabled systems to enhance
[**interoperability**. This could]{.mark} potentially have positive
spillover in better aligning EDT aspects of the EU]{.underline}
Capability Development Plan ([CDP]{.underline})[, the]{.underline}
Coordinated Annual Review on Defense ([CARD]{.underline})[, and
the]{.underline} respective NATO Defense Planning Process
([NDPP]{.underline})[. It would also [create **synergies** for the EU to
leverage its **budgetary and legislative tools**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which NATO lacks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to]{.mark} more effectively
[reinforce the Alliance.]{.mark}]{.underline} Lastly, it could
strengthen the collective "annual review of vulnerabilities in alliance
critical infrastructure and technologies, including those stemming from
foreign ownership and influence", as the NATO Secretary General has
proposed.

The plethora of applications of emerging and disruptive technologies in
the defense realm is something that both militaries and policymakers are
dealing with on a daily basis. Developments are rapid but, at the same
time, require long-term engagement and vision from senior leaders. In
the end, EDT not only has implications for soldiers on the battlefield,
but also for political decision-makers. [In the near term, the COVID
crisis is occupying much of the bandwidth and institutional capacity
across NATO and the EU]{.underline}, [at the expense of accelerating the
dialogue in support of defense innovation. But [**urgent action** is
needed to]{.mark} grow the transatlantic community's fast-shrinking
tech]{.underline}nological [advantage in defense. It is paramount for
leaders to **diligently and [intensively focus]{.mark} on this
topic**]{.underline}, [as opposed to simply **including it on the long
list of issues** for NATO or European Council meetings.]{.underline}
Through a structured EU-NATO Strategic Dialogue on EDT, it could rightly
become an integral part of the transatlantic meeting cycle, not least to
create a common understanding around future defense implications. To
this end, the NATO 2030 Reflection Group's proposed NATO digital summit
for governments and the private sector should be extended to EU
stakeholders and ultimately feed into this strategic dialogue.

[To stay secure, the transatlantic community must take on
e]{.underline}merging and [d]{.underline}isruptive
[t]{.underline}echnologies [**together**. It should be at the forefront
of the [joint action]{.mark} by the EU and NATO, reflecting the pressing
need to act. This [is of **foundational importance** for maintaining the
Alliance's **strategic edge**, addressing **vulnerabilities**]{.mark} of
tech, [and defending]{.mark} the **[norms and values]{.mark}** it was
built to protect. As the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
Europe renew their collective agenda at the dawn of the]{.underline} new
[Biden admin]{.underline}istration[, an EU-NATO Strategic Dialogue on
Defense Tech should be at the top of their list.]{.underline}

#### Insufficient U.S. support for [NIF]{.underline} and [DIANA]{.underline} is driving this fragmentation --- the plan is key to [supercharge]{.underline} NATO-EU cooperation on EDT.

2\. [Align EU-NATO work on defense innovation and find new formats of
engagement]{.underline}

[Both [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[EU have an interest in]{.mark}
investing in new and emerging defense tech]{.underline}nologies [and to
maintain [interoperability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly in the
context of the U.S. tech]{.underline}nology [race with China. [The
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [through
AUKUS]{.underline}, [[has established a]{.mark}n innovation [partnership
with **just**]{.mark} one European ally, **[the UK]{.mark}** (for
now)[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Meanwhile, [[NATO]{.mark} has [launched
a]{.mark} new defense innovation [fund and]{.mark}]{.underline} a
defense innovation accelerator ([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark})[. The
UK]{.underline}, which post-Brexit has given itself the guidance to
'Think NATO,'\[7\] [was a supporter of the Fund, **[but the
U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[**and
France are not members**.]{.underline}]{.mark} At the same time,
[[France]{.mark} often [argues]{.mark} that [the EU should be in the
lead]{.mark} on emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [and is pushing for
the creation of an Innovation Defense Hub within the
E]{.underline}uropean [D]{.underline}efense [A]{.underline}gency[[.
These]{.mark} defense innovation [efforts **pursued in parallel by both
org**]{.mark}**anization[s]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} already [leading
officials to **complain** about]{.mark} NATO [duplicating]{.mark} the EU
and vice versa. Both Americans and Europeans should try to **prevent a
rehashing of this unproductive talking point**.]{.underline}

[[Parallel to the EU]{.mark} branching out into 'traditional' security,
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} has been [broadening its]{.underline} own
[understanding of security to include newer domains]{.underline} such as
economic security, disruptive technologies, and disinformation.\[8\]
This development [[provides]{.mark} **clear [opportunities for
coop]{.mark}eration** between the two organizations]{.underline}, [[but
also]{.mark} presents [risks of **conflict** and **tension**.]{.mark}
NATO-EU cooperation today remains largely process-driven.
Inter-institutional exchanges are often focused on 'deconflicting'
rather than building genuine synergies]{.underline},\[9\] [and the
relationship suffers from long-standing political conflict between
Turkey and Cyprus and from newer tensions between the UK and France.
[The concurrent]{.mark} NATO [Strategic Concept and]{.mark} EU Strategic
[Compass]{.mark} processes [are an opportunity for the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark}
the [EU to **work together to improve NATO-EU coop**]{.mark}**eration
[on innovation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The next NATO-EU joint
declaration, which is scheduled to be published soon, could help by
acknowledging a new division of labor between the two institutions.

For instance, [[it would make sense]{.mark} for the two organizations
[to cooperate on **investment screening**, **research protection**,
and]{.mark} **initiatives to facilitate
[info]{.mark}**]{.underline}rmation[**[-sharing]{.mark} on dual-use
export and import controls** of critical
tech]{.underline}nology[.]{.underline}\[10\] [These [joint]{.mark}
NATO-EU [initiatives could]{.mark} usefully [build on]{.mark} the [work
done by the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the EU
at the [T]{.mark}]{.underline}rade and [[T]{.underline}]{.mark}echnology
[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ouncil[[.]{.mark} On defense
tech]{.underline}nology [development, the Americans and Europeans could
explore different new formats of engagement.]{.underline} For instance,
the United States could expand AUKUS to include more European countries
with relevant defense innovation profiles, such as France or Estonia.
Or, if AUKUS remains too politically sensitive for Paris, the
transatlantic allies could explore the possibility of the United States
joining selected PESCO projects geared towards defense innovation. [[The
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[may]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[want to **reconsider its decision not
to join DIANA**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### [U.S. support and participation]{.underline} is key to [overall alliance coordination]{.underline} on EDT. 

**Mundell 22** --- Ian Mundell, Innovation Reporter at
*Science\|Business*---a network of universities, companies, and research
and policy organisations promoting innovation, 2022 ("The Ecosystem: in
Europe, defence innovation is the new black," *Science\|Business*, June
7^th^, Available Online at

Accessed 07-03-2022)

[Suddenly]{.underline}, [it seems]{.underline}, [everyone cares about
Europe's defence innovation ecosystem. NATO is setting up]{.underline}
the Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, or
[DIANA]{.underline}, [with a significant presence in Europe. The
European Commission is working on the]{.underline} EU Defence Innovation
Scheme, [EUDIS. And]{.underline} last month, [Amazon Web Services
announced it is setting up a private defence accelerator in the
UK.]{.underline}

[But details of the [DIANA and EUDIS]{.mark} initiatives [have been
**slow**]{.mark} to emerge, leading to concerns that **gaps** and
**barriers to innovation** remain to be addressed.]{.underline} EUDIS in
particular leaves a lot of questions unanswered.

["It's **a step in the right direction**, but whether it is enough is
deeply debatable," said]{.underline} Nicholas [Nelson, senior fellow
with the Transatlantic Defense and Security Program at the Center for
European Policy Analysis]{.underline} in Washington DC[. "And this will
not be figured out in the next year or two. It [will take **five or ten
years**]{.mark} to see what the impact is."]{.underline}

[This sentiment is echoed by]{.underline} Alain [De Neve, a specialist
in defence innovation at Belgium's Royal Higher Institute for Defence.
"EUDIS is a timely initiative for the EU member states, although from a
macro-strategic point of view **there is still a long way to go** for
Europeans if they want [to build a competitive research
ecosystem]{.mark} on a more global scale," he said.]{.underline}

Detecting hidden threats

[EUDIS is intended to bring together all relevant EU initiatives that
support defence innovation and entrepreneurship.]{.underline} This
includes innovation-focused calls for proposals issued through the
European Defence Fund (EDF), such as a planned technological challenge
to test and mature technologies for hidden-threats detection, and a
four-year partnership for the development of defence medical counter
measures against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats.

The Commission also plans a number of initiatives intended to structure
the European defence ecosystem. Some of these are still frustratingly
vague. There is to be a dual-use incubator to allow better spin-in and
spin-out between the civil and defence sectors, and to spur
technological maturation and adaptation. This project was first floated
in the EU's 2021 Action plan on synergies between civil, defence and
space industries, which suggested it might be a virtual network based on
close collaboration between the Commission, the European Innovation
Council and the European Defence Agency.

At that stage, the incubator's potential activities included screening
EU-funded research for results relevant to defence and proposing them
for follow-up funding or user uptake. It was also to support new
technologies with dual-use potential coming from start-ups, SMEs, and
research and technology organisations. But these details and partners
have vanished from the latest description of the incubator, and the
Commission says it has nothing more to add while preparations are
on-going.

Detail is also still lacking on the cross-border innovation networks
listed as part of the EUDIS toolbox. These are intended to test the
relevance of technologies from the civil sector in defence-specific
environments. Then there will be other supporting measures for
innovative companies, such as matchmaking with primes, investors and end
users; business coaching; and the organisation of hackathons.

Defence Equity Facility

[The most concrete EUDIS initiative unveiled so far is the Defence
Equity Facility]{.underline}, [which is intended to address the lack of
risk capital in the EU for start-ups and small and mid-size companies
developing innovative defence tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}
The Commission will put €100 million into the facility over the next
five years, which is expected to be augmented by the European Investment
Fund and private investors to reach a total of €500 million.

"Enabling a better access to equity funding for innovative defence SMEs
and mid-caps would support their growth and finally benefit to the
innovativeness of the European defence technological and industrial
base," the Commission says in the latest EDF work programme, released on
25 May. "It will also reduce their exposure to non-EU investors and
benefit to the EU's strategic autonomy." The creation of the facility is
also intended to send a positive message to private investors that the
EU's defence sector is an attractive proposition.

[Nelson thinks the Defence Equity Facility is a **good
start**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} again **[a lot of important
detail is still missing]{.underline}**, [such as how and on what terms
the equity will be awarded.]{.underline} An enlightened choice would be
to make non-dilutive investments, the approach used by Air Force
Ventures in the US. "It is not taking equity, it is investing alongside
private capital investors, because it views this as good for the
ecosystem," Nelson said.

But [Nelson is also concerned that the facility potentially appears open
to all-comers]{.underline}, [rather than targeting start-ups and
companies with a civilian background moving into defence. If confirmed,
this will **limit its impact**.]{.underline}

For example, a seed round for a defence start-up might typically be
around €2 million, with €500,000 from the Commission contribution
required to lead the round. So, if the facility is focused exclusively
on this early stage investment it might support 40 companies a year,
which is modest enough. But if the facility gets involved in series A
and B rounds, which might run to €5-7 million per round, its reach will
be severely constrained. "To be honest, it needs to have another zero on
the end per annum to have a catalysing effect," said Nelson.

Gundbert [Scherf, co-founder and managing director of Helsing, a German
start-up active in a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence
[and software-defined defence, thinks this **lack of focus** is already
holding back EDF. "Only **8%** of EDF funds to date have been allocated
to disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies[. Consortiums primarily feature
traditional primes instead of deep tech disruptors]{.underline}, [who
actually invest their own money into de-risking tech and hiring the
right talent," he said. "In reality we need to spend the majority of
funds on disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [and empower new defence
companies that are developing them. Only this will deliver the
innovation, disruption, speed, and quality we need."]{.underline}

Dual-use technologies

[Another aspect of [EUDIS]{.mark} that [is unclear]{.mark} is [how it
will line up with]{.mark} **NATO's [DIANA]{.mark} initiative**. This was
launched]{.underline} in April, [with a mission to bring industry,
start-ups and academia together to research new dual-use
tech]{.underline}nologies[. Initially it will run a network of more than
10 accelerator sites and over 50 test centres in innovation hubs across
NATO alliance countries. The UK and Estonia will host DIANA's European
accelerators.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [a complementary NATO Innovation
Fund will invest €1 billion in early stage start-ups and other deep tech
funds]{.underline}, over an unspecified period of time[.]{.underline}

[The Commission says that it will work with NATO "[to]{.mark} ensure
that we can [develop synergies]{.mark} when and where possible". De Neve

[Beyond building collective capacity to operate more seamlessly in

approach from inception**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[rather than treating

Meeting the Challenge: Digital Technologies

[Due to the nature of the challenges that China poses to it, NATO's
priority should be to meet them at home. However, [in countering]{.mark}
the **economic**, **tech**]{.underline}nological[, and **security**
challenges that [China]{.mark} poses, [collaboration with **partner
countries** in the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} that are like-minded and have
valuable experience in countering Beijing's assertiveness [is]{.mark}
equally [important.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, as Secretary
General Stoltenberg has stated, NATO is unlikely to face the China
challenge by being physically present in the South China Sea or
elsewhere in the Indo-Pacific region.25 to resource constraints and
other concerns, this remains unlikely in the near future. [[NATO can
best meet the tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[challenge]{.mark}
that [China poses through]{.mark} greater collaboration and
[coordination with]{.mark} regard to the digital space and
[e]{.mark}]{.underline}merging and [[d]{.underline}]{.mark}isruptive
[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}echnologies[. While current NATO activity in
EDTs]{.underline}, as well as in data management and governance, [is **a
step in the right direction** to protect domestic resilience and to
enhance innovation capacities, there are further options [to]{.mark}
[strengthen the]{.mark} alliance's [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological
[[edge]{.mark} at home and [with partners]{.mark} in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}

**[Expand NATO collaboration on EDTs to partners in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**

[[NATO is]{.mark} in the process of [developing]{.mark} the mechanisms,
funding, and strategy behind [DIANA and the N]{.mark}]{.underline}ATO
[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}nnovation [[f]{.underline}]{.mark}und, the
former aimed at launching in 2023 and the latter potentially totaling to
\$1 billion. [DIANA aims to be NATO's version of]{.underline} the United
States' [D]{.underline}efense [A]{.underline}dvanced
[R]{.underline}esearch [P]{.underline}rojects [A]{.underline}gency [and
to bring together transatlantic efforts on critical
tech]{.underline}nologies[, working with industry and academia on AI,
big-data processing, quantum-enabled tech]{.underline}nologies[,
autonomy, biotech]{.underline}nology[, hypersonic weapons, and
space.]{.underline} Subsequently, [the Innovation Fund will seek
initially to invest \$81]{.underline}.2 [million per year in
transatlantic startups.]{.underline} Importantly, [it will work with
pre-vetted investors to ensure that "the tech]{.underline}nology [will
be protected from illicit transfers."]{.underline}26

[While much is still left to be decided on both these efforts, [there
are clear areas for **practical coop**]{.mark}**eration** with partners
in the Indo-Pacific; for example, [with]{.mark} regard to the
Australia-United Kingdom-United States (**[AUKUS]{.mark}**) security
pact [and **the Quad**]{.mark}]{.underline}rilateral Security Dialogue
[joining Australia, India, Japan, and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[.]{.underline}

First, AUKUS aims to promote cooperation beyond the initially agreed
nuclear-powered-submarine program. The agreement seeks to foster "deeper
integration of security and defense-related science, technology,
industrial bases and supply chains."27 Trilateral collaboration will
focus on cyber capabilities, AI, quantum technologies, and additional
undersea capabilities.

Following the first in-person leaders' summit of the Quad in September
2021, leaders of the four countries put forth an initiative to partner
on emerging technologies, space, and cybersecurity, and to cultivate
next-generation talent.28 Exact timelines for these initiatives are
still unclear. With regard to the latter, the Quad Fellowship will
provide 100 scholarships per year for students in science, technology
engineering, and mathematics from the four countries to study in the
United States. Ultimately, the program will seek to develop a network of
science and technology experts among the Quad countries. On critical and
emerging technologies, the countries will work together to publish a
statement of principles that touches on the design, development,
governance, and use of technology; to establish a technical standards
contact group; to launch a semiconductor supply-chain initiative; to
support 5G deployment and diversification; and to monitor advances in
biotechnologies.29 The Quad countries will also collaborate on
cybersecurity issues and establish a space-related working group that
shares climate change-related satellite data, enables capacity-building
in space-related domains in other Indo-Pacific countries, and consults
on norms and guidelines.

[While the overlap is not exact, there are significant areas for
cooperation between NATO, AUKUS, and Quad countries. [Australia and
Japan are already NATO partner countries]{.mark} and cooperate
politically with the alliance on a variety of levels from parliaments to
heads of state, ministries of foreign affairs and
defense.]{.underline}30 **\[\[\[\*\*\*Start Footnote 30\*\*\*\]**
[NATO's]{.underline} "[global partners]{.underline}," such as Australia
and Japan, [are countries with whom the alliance engages politically and
have access to the same activities that NATO]{.underline} Individual
Partnership Cooperation Programme [countries receive. They work with
NATO on areas of common interest, such as cyber defence,
counterterrorism, non-prolif]{.underline}eration[, and resilience. In
some cases, NATO and its global partners cooperate through NATO military
operations or through defence capacity, training, and educational
programmes.]{.underline} See NATO, Relations with partners across the
globe, August 25, 2021. **\[\[\[\*\*\*End Footnote 30\*\*\*\]\]\]**
[[Bringing partner countries into]{.mark} NATO's programing on [EDTs
would not only increase]{.mark} the alliance's [innovative capacities
but also]{.mark} allow it to [align]{.mark} itself [with]{.mark} the
[priorities]{.mark} of partners [in the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} to a
greater extent.]{.underline}

[[A]{.mark} potential [stumbling block]{.mark} for such cooperation
[might be]{.mark} the recent [tensions between the EU]{.mark} (and
therefore some NATO members) [and]{.mark} the [AUKUS]{.mark} countries.
Transatlantic relations soured following the announcement of the
establishment of the security pact and the related cancellation of the
submarine deal worth \$90 billion between Australia and France. The
announcement of AUKUS also coincided with the publication of the EU's
Indo-Pacific strategy]{.underline}, [which highlights the ambition to
work with the Quad in the region.]{.underline}31 [There is thus a
potential risk that EU members that are also [NATO members]{.mark},
**[in particular France]{.mark}**, [may prioritize]{.mark}
tech]{.underline}nological [[development within]{.mark} an [EU rather
than NATO]{.mark} context.]{.underline}

[This risk may be overstated, however. The EU's Indo-Pacific strategy
focuses primarily on digital governance and partnerships]{.underline}:
the development of shared technological standards, alone and together in
coordination with like-minded partners, for areas such enhancing
governance around AI based on democratic principles and fundamental
rights. [The EU's practical engagement with its Indo-Pacific partners on
the development of EDTs is still limited. It only has agreements on
areas of practical cooperation and development with a select few
countries in the Indo-Pacific, such as India and Japan with which it has
agreed to deepen cooperation on 6G, standardization, AI, blockchain, and
quantum and other tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

Second, [the security and defense section of the EU's Indo-Pacific
strategy does not make any mention of cooperation with like-minded
countries in the Indo-Pacific on EDTs. The strategy's main
focus]{.underline} here [is on cooperation on disinformation, maritime
security, outer space, cybersecurity, peacekeeping, counterterrorism,
and arms control. As the EU's focus on EDTs is primarily on **standard
setting**, **governance**, **ethics**, and **civilian applications**,
there may be an opportunity to **collaborate** and **share the burden**
with NATO. [NATO could **work alongside the EU**]{.mark} to ensure
standards are set for EDTs in the defense and civilian realms [while
**taking the lead** on]{.mark} the development and adoption of
[**defense-related** EDTs.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Establish NATO standards on data governance together with partners in
the Indo-Pacific

In 2017, the commander of NATO's Allied Command for Transformation,
General Denis Mercier, stated that "data is now a main strategic
resource. Processes for collecting, sharing, exploiting and distributing
data are the main drivers to adapting organizations."32 This remains
true with regard to the military and civilian, public and private
sectors. If shared policies on data governance promote interoperability,
help to establish rules and norms, and secure data, then divergent
policies could have the opposite effect. If NATO aims to remain
competitive and to increase its innovation strengths in EDTs and digital
technologies, digital policy coordination should be an area of
discussion within the alliance.

In October 2021, NATO defense ministers agreed to the alliance's
first-ever strategy for AI, which includes an ambition to agree on
standards of data collection and use for AI. NATO also has standards and
processes related to big data produced by the alliance.33 However, if
NATO members and partner countries seek to cooperate and collaborate on
the development and adoption of emerging technologies and data-driven
innovation, then addressing data governance and trusted cross-border
data flows between allies and across partners is of importance. To date,
some NATO members are aligned through membership of the EU and its
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and through the European Data
Governance Act (subject to final approval by the European Parliament and
Council of the EU this year).34 However, other allies, such as the
United States, have taken different approaches to data governance and it
remains to be seen whether the new EU-US Trade and Technology Council
can find solutions for transatlantic cooperation in this area.35

Last, [if collaboration between the innovative economies of NATO allies
and their partners in the Indo-Pacific is a goal, then greater
like-mindedness and alignment of data-governance norms should be an area
of consideration in the future within the alliance and with countries
like Australia, India, and Japan.]{.underline}

[This undoubtedly falls outside of the realm of NATO's traditional area
of competence and more clearly a suitable role for the European
Commission. This is not an obstacle: NATO has agreed already to work
with the EU in areas where the latter has experience and
competence.]{.underline} Furthermore, [the EU is an active player in
bilateral discussions between member states and non-EU countries about
data sharing and data governance. Its Indo-Pacific strategy already
envisions a greater role for the EU in the region in areas of digital
governance through Digital Partnership Agreements with Japan, Singapore,
and South Korea.]{.underline} The EU has already deepened its digital
partnership with India in 2021 which seeks to promote 5G in line with
global strategies and develop joint visions for next generations of
information and communications technology, to promote digital
cooperation between private sectors in each country, and to ensure that
data regulation in India and the EU align with each other. Similarly,
the EU and Japan created the world's largest area of safe data flows in
2019 when the European Commission adopted an adequacy decision on Japan
for a data-sharing agreement.36

Conclusion

[While countering the challenges that China poses to NATO will not be
easy, the greatest challenge will be to find agreement and unity between
allies on how to address their shared concerns about China's rise. The
limitations on NATO's resources]{.underline}, particularly due to the
requirements of allies to focus on collective security and defense at
home, [will make it difficult for the alliance to counter the China
challenge in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} Though a show of commitment
by sending military assets to the region and NATO's partners there is
important, addressing the challenges that China poses to the alliance
and its partners alike should be done in more varied ways.

[[NATO should]{.mark} focus on [expand]{.mark}ing its current work in
the digital sphere to [coop]{.mark}eration and collaboration
[with]{.mark} partner countries in [the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} in order
[to build a strong ecosystem]{.mark} of like-minded digital actors. [By
cooperating on EDTs]{.mark} and sharing data [to ensure]{.mark} that the
[private and public sectors]{.mark} in allied and partner countries [as
well as institutions like the EU remain competitive, NATO]{.mark} and
like-minded countries [can take steps toward **bolstering**]{.mark}
**their [defense and security capabilities]{.mark}** [and **preparing
for competition as well as**]{.mark} **for
[conflict]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[American foreign policy]{.underline} after---indeed,
[during]{.underline}---[the Russo-Ukrainian War should promptly head to
the world's most decisive region: **Asia**. This will require that
American foreign and defense policy **genuinely put Asia first**---in
our **military investments**, in our allocation of **political capital**
and **resources**, and in our leaders' **attention**.]{.underline}

[Nothing that has happened since Russia's]{.underline} abominable
[invasion of Ukraine has changed a set of facts: Asia is the world's
largest market area]{.underline}, [and it is growing in global share.
Located in the middle of Asia is China which]{.underline}, [alongside
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [is one of the world's two
superpowers. [China's]{.mark} behavior has become [**increasingly
aggressive** and]{.mark} domineering and appears [oriented toward
establishing]{.mark} Beijing's [**hegemony over Asia**.]{.mark} If
Beijing achieves this goal, the resulting consequences for American life
will be **dire**.]{.underline}

[[Preventing]{.mark} China from establishing [this]{.mark} hegemony over
Asia [must]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[be the priority]{.mark} of
U.S. foreign policy---even in the face of what is happening in
Europe.]{.underline} The simple fact is that **[[Asia is more important
than Europe]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and China is a **much greater
threat**]{.mark} than Russia.]{.underline} By way of comparison, [Asia's
economy is roughly twice as large as Europe's today---but within twenty
years it will likely be multiple times greater. China]{.underline}, in
the meantime, [has a GDP roughly **an order of magnitude** larger than
Russia's.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} current [trends continue, China appears **on a trajectory
to achieve its hegemonic ambitions**.]{.mark} Beijing has been building
a military distinctly not limited to territorial defense.]{.underline}
Rather, [[it will be capable of]{.mark} enabling Beijing's pursuit of
much larger and ambitious goals---first by **[ingesting
Taiwan]{.mark}**, [but **not ending there**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Indeed, [amidst the furor over the war in Ukraine, Beijing announced yet
again that it would increase its defense spending by 7 percent this
year.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [despite much talk, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has neglected its military
position in Asia]{.underline}, [while many of its allies---especially
Japan and Taiwan---have been laggard in maintaining their defenses. As a
result]{.underline}, [the military balance in Asia has continued to
shift markedly against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
our allies. In blunt terms, we are now **rapidly
approaching**]{.underline}, **[if not already in]{.underline}**, [**the
window of opportunity** where China might well decide to **attack
Taiwan**---**and we might lose**.]{.underline}

[Avoiding this outcome must be the **top**]{.underline}, [**overriding
priority** for [U.S. policy]{.mark}. This does not mean Europe is
unimportant or that we should neglect or abandon it. We
[should]{.mark}]{.underline} actively support Ukraine with weapons and
other forms of support while [[remain]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[firmly
committed to NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}, [albeit with our contributions
being more focused and narrow in scale. [But]{.mark} it does mean [Asia
must be our **priority**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and genuinely
so]{.underline}, [not just rhetorically as has so often been the case in
the past.]{.underline}

Because of these factors, [shifting our focus to Asia would make sense
regardless of how Russia's invasion of Ukraine fared. But]{.underline},
if anything, [the war in Ukraine and the reaction to it has made it even
more palatable for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to turn
to Asia. Moscow]{.underline}, [while still menacing and
dangerous]{.underline}, [has vividly demonstrated that its power is less
formidable than many of us had feared. Russia is very likely to try to
recover its strength]{.underline}, [but the losses of war and the impact
of sanctions are likely to make that process slow and difficult. At the
same time, Europe has stood up, announcing major increases in defense
spending, supporting Ukraine's own self-defense, and demonstrating an
unprecedented degree of cohesion in applying sanctions and other forms
of pressure on Russia.]{.underline}

[The result is that Moscow appears **less of a threat** than many of us
had supposed]{.underline}, [while Europeans are doing more to shoulder
their own defense.]{.underline} If anything, [this should make the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates **[more]{.underline}**, **[not
less]{.underline}**, [**ready to focus on Asia**.]{.underline} Indeed,
[in these circumstances, it is]{.underline} actually [hard to understand
the logic of increasing America's focus on Europe. Why would we double
down in Europe at the expense of Asia when there is less of a threat
from Russia and more European self-help---all while the danger in the
primary theater only increases?]{.underline}

[Yet many in the foreign policy and political elite seem to view the
Russo-Ukrainian War as an opportunity precisely to double down in
Europe.]{.underline} Even more, for some, it is a chance to try to turn
the foreign policy clock back to the globe-spanning liberal imperialism
of two decades ago.

[Washington must resist this temptation like the plague. The
breathtakingly hubristic foreign policies of the 2000s were unwise even
in the period of unipolarity]{.underline}, as we have found to our
chagrin. As American leaders sermonized on an end to evil, China rose at
our expense; our military expeditions in the Middle East ended in
frustration, when not failure; and we lost our military edge and many of
our economic advantages. [But such policies would be even more
extraordinarily ill-advised when we are now locked in a **strategic
rivalry** with a superpower [China]{.mark} that [is **far more
powerful** than the **USSR**, **Germany**, or **Japan** ever were.
We]{.mark} simply **[do not have]{.mark}** the preponderance of [power
to waste our resources]{.mark} anymore.]{.underline}

[[Time]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[to focus on]{.mark} the region and
the contest that really matters: [the effort to deny China's
dominance]{.mark} of Asia. [We are already]{.mark} well [behind]{.mark}
in that struggle]{.underline}, [[and **every day we neglect to
increase**]{.mark} **our [focus]{.mark}** [further increases the chances
of **crisis**, **war**, and **defeat**]{.mark}---with grievous
consequences for all Americans.]{.underline}

The Clash of Systems

[The history of international order building is one of **savage
[competition between clashing systems]{.mark}**, not of harmonious
cooperation. In the best of times, that competition took the form of a
cold war]{.underline}, [with each side jockeying for advantage and
probing each other with every measure short of military force. [In many
cases]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [the competition eventually
**[boiled over into a shooting war]{.mark}** and ended [with one side
crushing the other.]{.mark} The victorious order then ruled until it was
destroyed by a new competitor---or until it simply crumbled without an
external threat to hold it together.]{.underline}

[Today, a growing number of policymakers and pundits are calling for a
new concert of powers to sort out the world's problems and divide the
globe into spheres of influence. But the idea of [an inclusive
order]{.mark} in which no one power's vision prevails [is a
**fantasy**]{.mark} that can exist only in the imaginations of
world-government idealists and academic theorists. **[There are only two
orders]{.mark}** under construction right now---a
[**Chinese**-led]{.mark} one and a [**U.S.**-led]{.mark} one---and the
contest between the two is rapidly becoming a clash between autocracy
and democracy]{.underline}, [as both countries define themselves against
each other and try to infuse their respective coalitions with
ideological purpose. China is positioning itself as the world's defender
of hierarchy and tradition against a decadent and disorderly West; the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is belatedly summoning a new
alliance to check Chinese power and make the world safe for
democracy.]{.underline}

[This clash of systems will define the twenty-first century and divide
the world. China will view the emerging democratic order as a
containment strategy designed to strangle its economy and topple its
regime. In response, it will seek to protect itself by asserting greater
military control over its vital sea-lanes, carving out exclusive
economic zones for its firms, and propping up autocratic allies as it
sows chaos in democracies. The upsurge of Chinese repression and
aggression]{.underline}, in turn, [will further impel the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies to shun Beijing
and build a democratic order.]{.underline} For a tiny glimpse of what
this vicious cycle might look like, consider what happened in March
2021, when Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the EU
sanctioned four Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang.
The sanctions amounted to a slap on the wrist, but Beijing interpreted
them as an assault on its sovereignty and unleashed a diplomatic tirade
and a slew of economic sanctions. The EU returned fire by freezing its
proposed EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment.

[In the coming years, [the trade and tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
[[wars]{.mark} between China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates that began during the Trump administration [[will
**rage on** as both sides try to expand their]{.mark} respective
[spheres.]{.mark} Other countries will find it increasingly difficult to
hedge their bets by maintaining links to both blocs.]{.underline}
Instead, [[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will **push their partners to pick
sides**]{.mark}, compelling them to reroute their supply chains and
adopt wholesale the ecosystem of tech]{.underline}nologies [and
standards of one side's order.]{.underline} The Internet will be split
in two. When people journey from one order to the other---if they can
even get a visa---they will enter a different digital realm. Their
phones won't work, nor will their favorite websites, their email
accounts, or their precious social media apps. Political warfare between
the two systems will intensify, as each tries to undermine the domestic
legitimacy and international appeal of its competitor. East Asian
sea-lanes will grow clogged with warships, and rival forces will
experience frequent close encounters.

[[The standoff will end **only** when one side **defeats** or
**exhausts** the other.]{.mark} As of now, [the smart money is on the
U.S.]{.mark} side]{.underline}, [which has far more wealth and military
assets than China does and better prospects for future growth. By the
early]{.underline} 20[30s, Xi]{.underline}, an obese smoker with a
stressful job, [will be in his 80s]{.underline}, [if he is still alive.
China's demographic crisis will be kicking into high gear]{.underline},
[with the country projected to lose roughly 70 million working-age
adults and gain 130 million senior citizens between now and then.
Hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas Chinese loans will be
due]{.underline}, [and many of China's foreign partners won't be able to
pay them back. It is hard to see how a country facing so many challenges
could long sustain its own international order]{.underline}, [especially
in the face of determined opposition from the world's wealthiest
countries.]{.underline}

[[Yet it is]{.mark} also **[far from guaranteed]{.mark}** that the
U.S.-led democratic order will hold together.]{.underline} The United
States could suffer a constitutional crisis in the 2024 presidential
election and collapse into civil strife. Even if that doesn't happen,
the United States and its allies might be rent by their own divides. The
democratic world is suffering its greatest crisis of confidence and
unity since the 1930s. Nationalism, populism, and opposition to
globalism are rising, making collective action difficult. The East Asian
democracies have ongoing territorial disputes with one another. Many
Europeans view China as more of an economic opportunity than a strategic
threat and seriously doubt the United States' reliability as an ally,
having endured four years of tariffs and scorn from President Donald
Trump, who could soon be back in power. Europeans also hold different
views from Americans on data security and privacy, and European
governments fear U.S. technology dominance almost as much as they do
Chinese digital hegemony. India may not be ready to abandon its
traditional policy of nonalignment and back a democratic order,
especially when it is becoming more repressive at home, and an order
built around democracy will struggle to form productive partnerships
with autocracies that would be important partners in any alliance
against China, such as Singapore and Vietnam. [Fear of China is a
powerful force, but it might not be potent enough to paper over the many
**[cracks]{.mark}** that [exist within the emerging anti-Chinese
coalition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[If that coalition fails]{.mark} to solidify its international
order]{.underline}, then [[the world will]{.mark} steadily [slide back
into **anarchy**]{.mark}, a struggle among rogue powers and regional
blocs in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they
must. Some scholars assume---or hope---that an unordered world will sort
itself out on its own, that great powers will carve out stable spheres
of influence and avoid conflict or that the spread of international
commerce and enlightened ideas will naturally maintain global peace and
prosperity. But peace and prosperity are unnatural. When achieved, they
are the result of sustained cooperation among great
powers---]{.underline}that is, [of an international order.]{.underline}

Doubling Down On Democracy

[History shows that [eras of fluid multipolarity]{.mark} typically [end
in **disaster**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [regardless of the bright ideas or
advanced tech]{.underline}nologies [circulating at the time. [The late
eighteenth century]{.mark} witnessed the pinnacle of the Enlightenment
in Europe]{.underline}, [before the continent descended into the hell of
[the Napoleonic Wars.]{.mark} At the start of [the twentieth
century]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the world's sharpest minds predicted an
end to great-power conflict as railways, telegraph cables, and
steamships linked countries closer together. The [worst war in
history]{.mark} up to that point quickly [followed.]{.mark} The sad and
paradoxical reality is that [international orders]{.mark} are vital to
avert chaos]{.underline}, [yet they typically [emerge **only
during**]{.mark} **periods of [great-power rivalry]{.mark}**[. Competing
with China]{.mark} will be fraught with risk for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies, but it [might be **the only way to
avoid even greater dangers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To build a better future, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and its allies will need to take a more enlightened view of their
interests than they did even during the Cold War. Back then, their
economic interests dovetailed nicely with their geopolitical interests.
Simple greed]{.underline}, [if nothing else]{.underline}, [could compel
capitalist states to band together to protect private property against a
communist onslaught. Now]{.underline}, however, [the choice is not so
simple]{.underline}, [because standing up to China will entail
significant economic costs]{.underline}, [especially in the short term.
Those costs might pale in comparison to the long-term costs of business
as usual with Beijing]{.underline}---Chinese espionage has been
estimated to deprive the United States alone of somewhere between \$200
billion and \$600 billion annually---[to say nothing of the moral
quandaries and geopolitical risks of cooperating with a brutal
totalitarian regime with revanchist ambitions. Yet the ability to make
such an enlightened calculation in favor of confronting China may be
beyond the capacities of any nation, especially ones as polarized as the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and many of its democratic
allies.]{.underline}

[If there is any hope, it lies in a renewed commitment to democratic
values. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies
share a common aspiration for [an international order based on
democratic principles and enshrined in international agreements and
laws]{.mark}. The core of such an order [is being forged in]{.mark} the
crucible of [competition with China and could be]{.mark} built out into
**[the most enlightened order the world has ever seen]{.mark}**---a
genuine free world. But to get there, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies will have to **embrace competition
with China** and march forward together through another long twilight
struggle.]{.underline}

#### [Nuclear escalation]{.underline} is likely --- urgently strengthening [allied coordination]{.underline} to send a [signal of resolve]{.underline} is the only way to prevent it.

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear
war]{.underline}, [as]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin has
placed his nuclear forces at an elevated state of alert and has warned
that any effort by outside parties to interfere in the war would result
in "consequences you have never seen."]{.underline} Such saber-rattling
has understandably made headlines and drawn notice in Washington. [But
if China attempted to forcibly invade Taiwan and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [came to Taipei's aid, the threat of escalation
could outstrip even the current nerve-wracking situation in
Europe.]{.underline}

[A recent war game]{.underline}, [conducted by]{.underline} the
[C]{.underline}enter for a [N]{.underline}ew [A]{.underline}merican
[S]{.underline}ecurity in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the
Press," [demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could escalate.
The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027]{.underline}, [with the
aim of examining how the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
China might act under a certain set of conditions. The game demonstrated
that [China's **mil**]{.mark}**itary [mod]{.mark}ernization** [and
**expansion of its nuclear arsenal**]{.mark}]{.underline}---not to
mention the importance Beijing places on unification with
Taiwan---[[mean]{.mark} that]{.underline}, **[in the real
world]{.underline}**, [[a fight between China and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[**could very
well go nuclear**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. If the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty
[decides to invade the island, its [leaders **may not be able
to**]{.mark} **accept [fail]{.mark}ure** [without]{.mark} seriously
[harming]{.mark} the regime's [**legitimacy**.]{.mark}
Thus]{.underline}, [[the CCP might]{.mark} be willing to [take
**significant risks**]{.mark} to ensure that the conflict ends on terms
that it finds acceptable. That would mean convincing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies that the costs
of defending Taiwan are so high that it is not worth contesting the
invasion. While China has several ways to achieve that goal, **[from
Beijing's perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[using nuclear weapons
may be **the most effective**]{.mark} **means** to keep the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [out of the
conflict.]{.underline}

Gearing For Battle

[China is several decades into transforming its]{.underline} People's
Liberation Army ([PLA]{.underline}) [into what]{.underline} the Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping [has called a "world-class military"
that could defeat any third party that comes to Taiwan's defense.
China's warfighting strategy]{.underline}, [known as]{.underline}
"**[anti-access/area denial]{.underline}**," [rests on being able to
project conventional military power out several thousand miles in order
to prevent the American military]{.underline}, in particular, [from
effectively countering a Chinese attack on Taiwan.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, [[a **growing nuclear arsenal** provides]{.mark} Beijing with
[**coercive leverage** as well as]{.mark} potentially **[new warfighting
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} could **[increase
the risks]{.mark} of war and escalation**.]{.underline}

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. [The]{.underline} U.S.
[D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
[projects that by 2030, [China]{.mark} will have around 1,000
deliverable warheads---more than **triple** the number it currently
possesses. Based on these projections, Chinese leaders [may believe
that]{.mark} **as early as [five years from now]{.mark}** the PLA will
have made enough conventional and nuclear gains that [it]{.mark} could
fight and [win a war]{.mark} to unify [with Taiwan.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members of Congress, former
government officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of
senior national security decision makers in China and the United
States---[illustrated that [a U.S.-Chinese war could **escalate
quickly**.]{.mark}]{.underline} For one thing, [it showed that [both
countries would face **operational incentives** to strike military
forces]{.mark} on the other's territory.]{.underline} In the game, [such
strikes were **intended** to be calibrated to avoid escalation; both
sides tried to **walk a fine line** by attacking only military targets.
But [such attacks crossed red lines]{.mark} for both
countries]{.underline}, [[and produced a **tit-for-tat cycle**]{.mark}
**of attacks** [that broadened the **scope** and **intensity**]{.mark}
of the conflict.]{.underline}

For instance, in the simulation, China launched a preemptive attack
against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The attacks targeted
Guam, in particular, because it is a forward operating base critical to
U.S. military operations in Asia, and because since it is a territory,
and not a U.S. state, the Chinese team viewed striking it as less
escalatory than attacking other possible targets. In response, the
United States targeted Chinese military ships in ports and surrounding
facilities, but refrained from other attacks on the Chinese mainland.
Nevertheless, both sides perceived these strikes as attacks on their
home territory, crossing an important threshold. Instead of
mirror-imaging their own concerns about attacks on their territory, each
side justified the initial blows as military necessities that were
limited in nature and would be seen by the other as such. Responses to
the initial strikes only escalated things further as the U.S. team
responded to China's moves by hitting targets in mainland China, and the
Chinese team responded to Washington's strikes by attacking sites in
Hawaii.

A New Era

[One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that [China
found it necessary to threaten to go nuclear **from the start**]{.mark}
in order to ward off outside support for Taiwan.]{.underline} This
threat was repeated throughout the game, particularly after mainland
China had been attacked. At times, efforts to erode Washington's will so
that it would back down from the fight received greater attention by the
China team than the invasion of Taiwan itself. [[But China had
difficulty convincing the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates that [its
nuclear threats were credible.]{.mark} In real life, China's significant
and recent changes to its nuclear posture and readiness may impact other
nations' views]{.underline}, [as its nuclear threats may not be viewed
as credible given its stated doctrine of no first use, its smaller but
burgeoning nuclear arsenal, and lack of experience making nuclear
threats. [This may push China to **preemptively detonate**]{.mark} **a
nuclear weapon** [to **reinforce the credibility of its
warning**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[China might also resort to a demonstration of its nuclear might because
of **constraints** on its long-range conventional strike capabilities.
Five years from now, the PLA still will have a very limited ability to
launch conventional attacks beyond]{.underline} locations in the "second
island chain" in the Pacific; namely, [Guam and Palau. Unable to strike
the U.S. homeland with conventional weapons, China would struggle to
impose costs on the American people.]{.underline} Up until a certain
point in the game, the U.S. team felt its larger nuclear arsenal was
sufficient to deter escalation and did not fully appreciate the
seriousness of China's threats. As a result, China felt it needed to
escalate significantly to send a message that the U.S. homeland could be
at risk if Washington did not back down. Despite China's stated
"no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game resulted in Beijing
detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii as a demonstration.
The attack caused relatively little destruction, as the electromagnetic
pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the immediate vicinity
but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war game ended before
the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the first use of a
nuclear weapon since World War II would have provoked a response.

[The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China are different from
those that were most likely during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [feared a
massive]{.underline}, [bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack]{.underline},
[which would precipitate a full-scale strategic exchange. In a
confrontation over Taiwan,]{.underline} however, [Beijing could employ
nuclear weapons in a more limited way to signal resolve or to improve
its chances of winning on the battlefield. It is unclear how a war would
proceed after that kind of limited nuclear use and whether the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could de-escalate the
situation while still achieving its objectives.]{.underline}

An Ounce of Prevention

[The clear lesson from the war game is that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs to
**strengthen its conventional capabilities**]{.mark} **in the
Indo-Pacific** to ensure that China never views an invasion of Taiwan as
a prudent tactical move.]{.underline} To do so, the United States will
need to commit to maintaining its conventional military superiority by
expanding its stockpiles of long-range munitions and investing in
undersea capabilities. Washington must also be able to conduct offensive
operations inside the first and second island chains even while under
attack. This will require access to new bases to distribute U.S. forces,
enhance their survivability, and ensure that they can effectively defend
Taiwan in the face of China's attacks.

Moreover, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[needs]{.mark} to develop [an
**integrated network of partners**]{.mark} willing to contribute to
Taiwan's defense. [Allies are an **asymmetric advantage**]{.mark}: the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has them]{.underline}, [and
China does not. [The U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should **deepen strategic and
operational planning with key partners** to send a **strong signal of
resolve**]{.mark} to China.]{.underline} As part of these planning
efforts, the United States and its allies will need to develop
war-winning military strategies that do not cross Chinese red-lines. The
game highlighted just how difficult this task may be; what it did not
highlight is the complexity of developing military strategies that
integrate the strategic objectives and military capacities of multiple
nations.

Moving forward, [military planners in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and]{.underline} in Washington's [allies and
partners must grapple with the fact that]{.underline}, [in a conflict
over Taiwan, China would consider all conventional and nuclear options
to be on the table.]{.underline} And [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[is **running out of time** to
**strengthen deterrence**]{.mark} and keep China from believing an
invasion of Taiwan could be successful. The biggest risk is that
Washington and its friends choose not to seize the moment and act: **[a
year or two from now]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**it might already be too
late**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## Case Backlines

### They Say: "Status Quo Solves"

#### This arg takes out [their disads]{.underline}, not [our case]{.underline} --- NATO has already committed to increase EDT innovation, but the [missing piece]{.underline} remains [increased U.S. security cooperation]{.underline}. That's the plan.

Investment challenges

As noted in the introduction, [[there is a **significant gap**
between]{.mark} overall [US and European]{.mark} defence spending
levels. This general pattern also holds for [defence
r]{.mark}]{.underline}esearch [[and d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment
[spending. In 2020,]{.underline} EU spending in this area amounted to €8
billion (EDA 2021). For [the US]{.underline}, with caveats as to
comparability, expenditure for 'research, development, test and
evaluation' [totalled]{.underline} approximately €90 billion3 in the
2021 fiscal year (from October 2020 to September 2021), or [about **10
times more**.]{.underline}

[Investment challenges go beyond issues of scale. [The US]{.mark} also
[has greater **experience** in the **setting up** and **operation** of
**structures** to promote]{.mark} both military and dual-use
[innovation.]{.mark} While the best-known institution is]{.underline}
the **[D]{.underline}**efense **[A]{.underline}**dvanced
**[R]{.underline}**esearch **[P]{.underline}**rojects
**[A]{.underline}**gency, [other US government structures are also
relevant in discussions on fostering innovation in AI for military
applications. A much-discussed example is **In-Q-Tel**]{.underline},
which was originally set up as the state venture-capital arm of the
Central Intelligence Agency. To illustrate the influence of the In-Q-Tel
example, one may note that both its current Chief Executive Officer,
Chris Darby, and one of its former Chief Executive Officers, Gilman
Louie, served among the 15 commissioners of the National Security
Commission on Artificial Intelligence.4 This was a temporarily created
expert commission mandated \[end page 17\] by the US Congress to provide
policy recommendations for a whole-of-government and whole-of-society
approach for US AI policy.5

[With In-Q-Tel, the idea is to **learn from private-sector practices**
in the area of venture-capital investment and repurpose them for state
needs and more patient time horizons. A supported company should pursue
product development strategies aimed at serving both civilian markets
and government needs.]{.underline} In this way, [rather than
**effectively taking** over a commercial company and **limiting its
growth potential** to future government contracts alone, the government
body encourages an **intermediate trajectory** made up of **mixed
revenue streams**]{.underline}, [in the hope that this will generate
greater returns to scale and higher efficiency thanks to the
disciplining effect of private-sector competition.]{.underline}
Conversely, [the advantage of this approach as compared to not
intervening at all is that the commercial company will **integrate
current and likely future government needs** into its product and
business-development strategy]{.underline}, [rather than ignoring them
and finding itself]{.underline}, [at a later date]{.underline},
[**unable to supply the government sector** according to the latter's
requirements.]{.underline}

[A related issue which falls between what can be achieved with new
investment instruments and new protections that can be assured through
the screening of f]{.underline}oreign [d]{.underline}irect
[i]{.underline}nvestment [is the provision of investment from **trusted
private investors** to the tech]{.underline}nology [sector. Certain
tech]{.underline}nology [companies that are not part of the traditional
defence industry may be developing dual-use products that are of
potential interest to the defence sector while having limited awareness
of national security concerns. This may make them **vulnerable targets**
for both licit and illicit attempts to acquire their
tech]{.underline}nologies [on the part of foreign state
actors.]{.underline} At the same time, [their business development needs
may lead them to seek investment from any potential source]{.underline},
[thus exposing them to potential risks. To respond to this challenge,
the US D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense
[has launched a scheme called the **Trusted Capital
Marketplace**]{.underline} (US Department of Defense
2021a)[.]{.underline}

[Building on these considerations]{.underline}, [the NATO Innovation
Unit has developed two new instruments for Allied use which were
announced]{.underline} to the public [in]{.underline} October
[2021]{.underline} (NATO 2021a; 2021b)[. Both instruments aim to foster
tech]{.underline}nological [innovation with a deliberate focus on
dual-use applications and on enterprises with mixed (potential) revenue
streams. The first instrument is]{.underline} the Defence Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic (**[DIANA]{.underline}**), [which is
a NATO instrument]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} is, it [involves the
participation of all 30 NATO Allies. The second instrument is the **NATO
Innovation Fund**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in NATO terminology
[is a 'multinational' instrument]{.underline}, namely one [that Allies
freely opt into.]{.underline}

[DIANA will aim to accelerate the adoption of dual-use
tech]{.underline}nological [solutions through several interlocking
components.]{.underline}6 First, [it will develop a network of national
organisations, in particular test centres and innovation
accelerators.]{.underline} Second, [it will competitively select
private-sector innovators and allow them to use national organisations
in the network to interface with military end users and military
capability-development specialists.]{.underline} Third, [it is envisaged
that DIANA will provide mentorship and education services for private
innovators to familiarise them with the opportunities and
responsibilities inherent to the defence and security
sector.]{.underline} Fourth, [DIANA will develop a database of trusted
financial investors from Allied nations and support matchmaking between
investors and innovators.]{.underline} Fifth and \[end page 18\]
finally, [DIANA will also provide expert advice on defence and security
innovation to all relevant stakeholders]{.underline}, [including
private-sector and academic entities.]{.underline}

[Regarding the N]{.underline}ATO [I]{.underline}nnovation
[F]{.underline}und[, 17 Allies had opted into the Fund as
of]{.underline} the date of its announcement in [October 2021. The
participating Allies will inject up to €1 billion into Allied innovation
ecosystems over the next 15 years. The Fund aims to attract additional
private investments due to the de-risking effect]{.underline}, [both
financial and tech]{.underline}nological, [thanks to state co-funding
and diligence and screening efforts. The funds are intended to be used
for long-term support of 'deep tech' innovative companies]{.underline},
that is, [for advanced research into AI, quantum and related
tech]{.underline}nologies [that may have both military and civilian
applications. Due diligence and security screening practices will aim to
ensure that both private investors and fund recipients are trusted
entities.]{.underline}

Conclusions

[[Much has already been achieved in]{.mark} terms of [**new
structures**,]{.mark} **new [initiatives]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **new
[policy developments]{.mark}** to support the collaborative adoption of
AI among NATO Allies and EU member states. In addition to pre-existing
structures and mechanisms at both the NATO and EU levels]{.underline},
[which have ensured that nations are not starting from scratch, national
defence institutions are already able to refer to common policy
commitments and to options]{.underline}, [whether through NATO or the
EDA]{.underline}, [for research or capability-development activities. At
the same time, ensuring a competitive edge in AI is a truly
whole-of-government effort which requires considerable cross-over
between the military and civilian realms.]{.underline}

[[**Large gaps** remain]{.mark} between the US and the EU on certain key
indicators. At the same time, the gaps pertaining to research are far
smaller. [To ensure greater]{.mark} European [performance]{.mark} and
relevance in AI in general]{.underline}, [and its defence applications
in particular]{.underline}, [it seems desirable to [focus on]{.mark} two
strategic priorities: [investment volumes]{.mark}]{.underline}, [both
public and private]{.underline}, [[which need to be significantly
increased]{.mark}; [and **the full use of collaborative mechanisms
involving the US**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[To that end]{.underline}, [[it would be beneficial for]{.mark} nations
on [both sides]{.mark} of the Atlantic [to ensure]{.mark} that [a
**clear and common vision**]{.mark} is set out in forthcoming strategic
documents]{.underline}, most notably the EU's Strategic Compass and
NATO's new Strategic Concept. [[This should include **clear political
commitments**]{.mark} to increasing investment]{.underline}, [both in
general and in instruments for promoting collaborative innovation. There
are opportunities for 'more Europe' through the EDA and the
E]{.underline}uropean [D]{.underline}efence [F]{.underline}und[. But
while pursuing those avenues]{.underline}, [[Europe]{.mark}an capitals
[should prioritise efforts that **complement** and **enhance**
transatlantic approaches]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[in recognition]{.mark}
of the reality [that **the US remains the indispensable ally**]{.mark}
**for Europe's security**.]{.underline}

The internet, microwaves, and synthetic rubber came into our lives as
products invented for military purposes. Even everyday things, such as
undershirts and concentrated fruit juice were created to improve the
combat readiness of armed forces. Though many people typically associate
the military with war and suffering, this industry has been a source of
incredible progress, producing inventions that made our lives longer,
healthier, and easier. These days, innovation is likely to run the other
way, with the military benefiting from inventions developed with private
funding.

[A symbiotic relationship between military needs and human
progress]{.underline} is not necessarily the default. Instead, it
[requires a well-oiled innovation ecosystem in which military and
civilian industries share their expertise and knowledge with one
another. [NATO has]{.mark} recently [announced several
initiatives]{.mark} to build on past success, **[but more are
needed]{.mark}**---particularly as members increase their military
funding.]{.underline}

[Virtually all alliance members are investing more in defense or are
soon planning to do so.]{.underline} Germany, for example, declared that
it would create a 100-billion-Euro fund and reach its 2% goal in 2022.
Poland, which shares the longest EU border with Ukraine, has taken in
more than 3.5 million Ukrainian refugees and promised to dedicate 3% of
its GDP to defense. Croatia ramped up its defense investment to 2.3% of
GDP.

[To ensure that this new investment spurs innovation and co-operation
between military and civilian industries as well as academia, NATO
announced]{.underline} in April the [D]{.underline}efense
[I]{.underline}nnovation [A]{.underline}ccelerator for the

deep tech]{.underline}nologies, [including a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[, big-data processing, quantum-enabled
tech]{.underline}nologies[, biotech]{.underline}nology[, novel
materials, and outer space.]{.underline} In addition, [17 NATO nations

In 1960, the U.S. accounted for 69 percent of global R&D investments,

spending.]{.underline} The bulk ([65%]{.underline}) [of U.S. investments
in defense-related R&D was financed from the federal budget. However, by
2019, the U.S. share of global R&D fell to 30%, and the share of federal
government investment in defense-related R&D fell from 65% to 21%,
whereas the share of business investment in R&D has grown from 33% to
71%. This leaves no doubt that [meaningful innovation is not possible

Russian president Vladimir [Putin's]{.underline} February [attack on
Ukraine was a strategic blunder. NATO had already established itself as
the most successful and longest-lasting military alliance in modern
history. Putin's invasion has only served to **strengthen NATO** by
rallying an unprecedented post-Cold War consensus within the alliance in
favor of military preparedness and a shared commitment to deter
aggression against any member.]{.underline} In addition, NATO member
states have strongly supported the economic sanctions and other
political measures to isolate Russia and raise the costs attendant to
Russia's continued fighting in Ukraine. Additionally, in May, political
leaders in Finland and Sweden announced their intention to apply for
NATO membership. The likely addition of two formerly neutral states to
the alliance will further add to Russia's discomfiture and NATO's
optimism about its ability to deter further aggression in Europe.

[In the aftermath of Putin's invasion and NATO's likely
expansion]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [**complacency** among
member states should be avoided. [Deterring Russia]{.mark} in the short
term **[understates the demands]{.mark}** that the international system
and European politics will impose [on]{.mark} an expanded [NATO]{.mark}
in the years to come. NATO's [**political cohesion**, **military
readiness**, and **escalation management skills** will be **essential**
for dealing with]{.mark} **a variety of challenges** and open questions.
Among these include what to do with [a **post-Putin Russia**;]{.mark}
deterring and defeating **transnational [terrorism]{.mark}**[;]{.mark}
the alliance's relationship with a **rising [China]{.mark}**[;]{.mark}
member states' ability to maintain **[stable democratic
regimes]{.mark}** within their own countries and **promote democratic
institutions** among non-NATO states; [and]{.mark} adapting the
alliance's **military strategy** to [a new world of
**tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [that privileges cognitive warfare,
space, and cyber capabilities.]{.underline}

The first issue is the political relationship between NATO and Russia
after Putin either retires or is removed from office. For much of the
1990s, there was considerable optimism that post-Soviet Russia would be
a more dependable strategic partner for NATO. Some even anticipated that
a more democratic Russia might evolve from the ruins of the former
Soviet Union. The whiff of optimism was soon dissipated, however, by
events during the end of the 1990s, especially after NATO's air war
against Serbia over Kosovo. When former Russian president Boris Yeltsin
resigned and turned over the presidency to Putin, the stage was set for
a return to a more traditional Russian view of geopolitics with respect
to the United States and NATO. Putin's support for the U.S. invasion of
Afghanistan in 2001 expedited cordial relations between the Russian
president and U.S. president George W. Bush. But, by the time Bush
departed from office, Putin had adopted a harder line toward NATO.
Russia's war with Georgia in 2008 marked a turning point that, with the
advantage of hindsight, was a foretaste of things to come during the
next fourteen years.

If Russia's war against Ukraine is eventually settled by diplomatic
negotiations following a protracted military conflict, then a postwar
regime in Russia---with or without Putin---will have several options.
First, it could maintain the revisionist stance toward the present
rules-based international order in Europe and elsewhere. Second, it
could adopt a more status quo-oriented policy that settles for a modus
vivendi with an expanded NATO, pocketing small gains obtained in the war
against Ukraine and, at least for the short term, gives up on the
ambition of regime change in other European countries. Or it may move
toward a détente with NATO and a more expansive policy of diplomatic,
military, and cultural engagement with leading NATO powers, including
the United States. The departure of Putin from office may push the lever
toward the latter two options, although that depends upon the power
struggle that follows him and the character of his successor.

A second issue for NATO will be its collective security agenda with
respect to international terrorism. NATO support for U.S. military
operations in Afghanistan was an essential component of U.S. combat and
non-combat responses to the challenges posed by the Taliban and other
non-state actors in that country. U.S. intelligence collaboration with
NATO allies and within the Five Eyes group---consisting of the United
States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand---is
supported by global deployments of American special operations forces
and other military and intelligence assets, including those of NATO
allies. A robust network of information sharing tracks the military
activities and communications of Al Qaeda and other major transnational
terror networks. Although Biden's national security strategy
acknowledges that the United States now faces the problem of emerging
peer competitors and the renewed threat of great power war, the threats
posed by domestic and international terrorists have not gone away. In
the wake of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan in August
2021, the Taliban, ISIS-K, and other groups with anti-American or
anti-Western agendas will find new sanctuaries and outside support.
These and other terrorist groups can use modern net-centric warfare to
radicalize individuals across the globe and direct them against U.S. or
allied targets. The possibility of a terrorist attack that uses weapons
of mass destruction should also not be discounted as a continuing
aspiration among radicals.

A third issue for NATO will be how to rethink its relationship with a
rising China. China's growing military and economic power challenges the
Eurocentric international rules-based order and creates several security
dilemmas for the United States and its allies. In addition to the
immediate threat posed to Taiwan, China also creates military and
political risks for Japan, South Korea, Australia, the Philippines,
Vietnam, and other states in Asia. China's long-range nuclear arsenal is
growing---by the end of this decade, it is expected to deploy a triad of
strategic nuclear launchers on land-based ballistic missiles,
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and long-range bombers. China's
sophisticated space program includes the ability to deploy satellites
capable of shadowing other satellites or, if necessary, destroying them.
Chinese cyberattacks against the United States and other countries
regularly succeed in stealing intellectual property and classified
government information. China's Belt and Road Initiative, driven by a
policy of buying up critical infrastructure for trade, manufacturing,
and shipping, has increased its leverage over other governments and
turned a much-ballyhooed form of globalization into a Chinese strategic
triumph over whipsawed competitors. China's continuing support for
Russia will also capture NATO's attention as Russia's war in Ukraine
continues to roil Europe.

A fourth issue that NATO must face is the fragility of democratic
politics in a complicated twenty-first-century tapestry of ideologies
and communications technologies. The twentieth century is a reminder
that democracies can be toppled from within by adverse economic,
political, and social forces. Timothy Snyder's exemplary research has
shown the potency of authoritarian appeals to a faux sense of
nationalism and a reconstructed history, including in Russia. Europe as
a collection of democratic countries based on consensual governments and
pluralistic policymaking processes cannot be taken for granted. In the
twenty-first century, a democratic Europe will face several challenges,
including the growth of nationalist parties with anti-democratic
agendas; changes in Western political cultures that privilege extremism
and tribalism; the adverse consequences of "globalization," including
breakdowns in supply chains, the spread of pandemics, the disruption of
markets, and the growth of an elite transnational class; and political
coercion and military pressure from authoritarian regimes against
democratic ones, within and outside of Europe.

Fifth, [[NATO will have to **adapt**]{.mark} **its strategies and
policies** [to emerging tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[for
deterrence or warfighting]{.mark} in the space and cyber domains,
human-machine interface, drone warfare, and unforeseen developments in
bioengineering, nanotech]{.underline}nology[, and cognitive science. If
the twentieth century was the apogee of mass destruction in the
industrial age, the twenty-first century will offer a variety of
unconventional conflict settings]{.underline}, [often combined with
kinetic action. Major powers will be defined not only by the size of
their military forces but also by how nimble and adaptive those forces
are.]{.underline} Ukraine's ability to defeat or slow the advances of
Russian forces has illustrated the priority of adaptive learning and the
superior use of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance to
support kinetic operations. Even future ground wars, notwithstanding
those at sea or in space, will move at light speed. Commanders may be
overwhelmed by mountains of data challenging their ability to separate
the wheat from the chaff. The smart systems designed to unravel the
chaos of battle will also contribute their own uncertainties to it.

[[How]{.mark} member [states deal with these]{.mark} challenges [will
determine whether NATO continues to be **the most successful**]{.mark}
**military [alliance in]{.mark} modern [history]{.mark}**[. This is
**not the time**]{.mark} for the alliance [to **lapse into
complacency**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[What happens when an alliance's competitors quickly improve their
tech]{.underline}nology [and capabilities to place the alliance at
increased risk?]{.underline} The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) addressed this dilemma during a recent summit in Brussels. At the
summit, the North Atlantic Council built upon NATO's 2030 strategic
outline and presented targets for increased technological collaboration
to counter growing threats from Russia, China, and non-state actors.
[While NATO's scientific and tech]{.underline}nical [superiority has
historically allowed it to outpace competitors, its adversaries are
**quickly closing the gap**.]{.underline}

NATO members still hold advantages in their development of new
technologies. According to the Global Innovation Index, seven of the top
ten most innovative countries globally are part of NATO, while the other
three are key NATO partners. Even so, [[NATO can do **more** to
harness]{.mark} the alliance's **[combined
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological [[**prowess** to **better compete
and win**]{.mark} in a future conflict. As China seeks to become the
world's innovation leader and Russia continues to undermine the
alliance's security, [NATO will need to **out-innovate its
competitors**]{.mark} and prepare for an **uncertain
future**.]{.underline}

Four areas where NATO can focus on improving its competitive edge are
developing its formal organizations, increasing public and private
sector collaboration, harnessing and countering Emerging Disruptive
Technologies (EDTs), and improving conventional military equipment.
[NATO must maintain its relative lead in tech]{.underline}nology
[sectors to defend its people and enhance its long-term strategic
position. [Improving]{.mark}]{.underline} science and technology
([S&T]{.underline}) [[innovation will **increase alliance
collaboration**,]{.mark} **strengthen public and private sector
cooperation**, [counter **hybrid threats**, **deter adversaries**, and
**harden defenses against attacks**.]{.mark} NATO's effectiveness in the
future will **heavily depend** on its ability to maintain and improve
its science and tech]{.underline}nology [capabilities.]{.underline}

A Changing Environment

[The global geopolitical situation has **changed significantly** over
the past decade. Although NATO remains the world's most successful and
powerful alliance, China and other adversaries are **quickly reducing**
NATO's military and scientific advantages.]{.underline} In just the past
year, China raised its defense budget by 6.8 percent and continues to
build global power projection capabilities in addition to its regional
defenses. [As part of]{.underline} what some call [a Fourth Industrial
Revolution, Beijing is rapidly investing in AI,
biotech]{.underline}nology[, robotics, and other new
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[Russia is also developing new tech]{.underline}nologies, [especially in
areas where it can exploit NATO's weaknesses.]{.underline} Russia's
ballistic missiles can reach anywhere in Europe, and Russia has placed
renewed emphasis on improved missile technology, such as recent
hypersonic advances. Russia has built a robust Anti-Access Area Denial
(A2AD) network on Europe's eastern flank while simultaneously expanding
military capabilities into its Arctic region. Both areas pose direct
security challenges to NATO, which the alliance's S&T efforts can help
mitigate.

Over the past decade, NATO has recognized the need for increased
innovation and technological advancements. In 2012, the alliance created
the Science and Technology Organization, taking on the former roles of
the NATO Research and Technology Organization, including its executive
function. It also incorporated the former NATO Undersea Research Center,
established the NATO Chief Scientist position, and outlined the unified
governance of NATO S&T. In 2020, NATO created an Innovation Board and an
Advisory Group on Emerging and Disruptive Technologies to provide
external advice to NATO on optimizing its innovation efforts.

[At the 2021]{.underline} Brussels [Summit, NATO agreed to
launch]{.underline} a civil-military Defense Innovation Accelerator for
the North Atlantic ([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark}) to "foster
transatlantic cooperation on critical technologies, promote
interoperability and harness civilian innovation by engaging with
academia and the private sector, including start-ups." [There are plans
to establish]{.underline} a NATO Innovation Fund
([[NIF]{.underline}]{.mark}), where allies "can support start-ups
working on dual-use emerging and disruptive technologies in areas key to
Allied security." [These [are steps in the right direction]{.mark},
[**but NATO can do more**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Expanding Technological Organizations

In conjunction with its newest additions, the DIANA and NIF, NATO can
expand the capacities of its Science and Technology Organization (STO)
to boost research and development (R&D) in artificial intelligence (AI),
missile and missile defense technology, space, cyber, and other EDTs.
The STO is the world's largest defense and security research forum,
employing over 6,000 scientists from allied nations. However, the STO
does not turn NATO defense spending into tangible products or equipment
for the alliance.

NATO could use the STO to streamline research and product development,
ensuring all allies are working toward a common goal and not spending
resources on identical R&D. For instance, each country could allocate
part of its defense budget to develop standardized systems like
integrated air, missile, and cyber defenses. Whether using the STO or
DIANA as its main innovation driver, [NATO must continue developing its
formal institutions to harness solutions that benefit the entire
alliance and help it achieve]{.underline} its three core tasks of
[collective defense, crisis management, and cooperative
security.]{.underline}

Public and Private Sector Collaboration

The Brussels Summit Communique also recommends continuing the R&D of AI
technologies and identifying alliance gaps in this critical focus area.
Many of these advancements occur in the private sector, and NATO must
find ways to use those technologies for the alliance. The U.S. National
Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence's March 2021 report
states that AI-enabled warfare is part of the near future. While the
United States and NATO are currently ahead in these technologies, other
countries will soon pass them unless they increase their R&D efforts.

In addition to boosting research through the STO and DIANA, [[NATO can
streamline]{.mark} the [acquisition of commercial sector]{.mark}
AI-focused [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [for national security
purposes [and create an alliance-wide process that acquires emerging
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[from the private
sector.]{.underline}]{.mark} The rapidly changing nature of emerging
technologies and the quantity and depth of innovation seen in the
private sector require an acquisitions system that is not only fast but
allows for the rapid integration of updated product iterations and
innovations. Autocratic competitors excel in private and public sector
integration, given the nature of their systems. [[Improving]{.mark} its
ability to apply privately developed tech]{.underline}nology [for
military uses rapidly [will ensure]{.mark} that NATO retains [its
**competitive edge**]{.mark} over its predominantly autocratic
adversaries.]{.underline}

Harnessing and Countering Emerging Disruptive Technologies

While emerging and disruptive technologies (EDTs) touch all aspects of
life and present exciting opportunities for the alliance, they also
present threats. Many of NATO's adversaries use EDTs against alliance
personnel and infrastructure, such as recent cyberattacks targeting
Polish politicians and the Colonial Pipeline. [Enhancing its
[innovation]{.mark} processes [will]{.mark} allow NATO to improve its
military tech]{.underline}nology [across all domains and boost its
**deterrence** and defense capabilities. NATO could then [better deter
**Russian and Chinese hybrid threats**]{.mark} in **cyber**, **space**,
**electronic warfare**, and **information domains**.]{.underline} For
instance, NATO can use its forthcoming Cyber Command to take collective
action and demonstrate cyberspace thresholds that will result in unified
offensive cyber or conventional responses if crossed by its adversaries.
[By strengthening its cyber abilities and adding new capabilities, NATO
can deter adversaries in the information space and take the offensive
against them. [NATO would]{.mark} then [rob Russia and China of
success]{.mark} in areas where they currently excel]{.underline}, [[and
better protect]{.mark} the alliance's people and
[**infrastructure**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conventional Military Improvements

[NATO can also use its tech]{.underline}nological [advancements to
improve its conventional military capabilities.]{.underline} One
critical area where NATO must focus is its integrated air and missile
defense. Russian nuclear weapons can reach anywhere in Europe and NATO
cannot adequately defend against new technologies like swarm warfare or
hypersonic missiles. Two of NATO's high-visibility modernization
programs focus on combating air and missile threats, but NATO must do
more to combat emerging and future adversary weapons.

As the United States continues R&D on a Patriot missile system
replacement, NATO countries could ingrate into its supply chain, like
that of the F-35 aircraft, or develop complementary systems that fill
gaps in the U.S. air defense system's effectiveness. The current NATO
Integrated Air and Missile Defense system uses mainly American-made
radars and missiles stationed in NATO countries. While effective, NATO
could harden its defenses by fielding European-developed systems that
are compatible with current and future U.S. systems, thus expanding its
anti-access area denial (A2/AD) bubble while simultaneously reducing air
and missile threats. Furthermore, the alliance can conduct more combined
military exercises to test new equipment and boost unit proficiency.
Improving its deterrence and defenses in critical areas will reduce the
military threats from NATO's adversaries as they seek to sow division
and destabilize the alliance. [When it couples military advances with
other areas of tech]{.underline}nological [improvement, NATO gains the
best chance of maintaining its competitive edge.]{.underline}

[NATO will still need to overcome **bureaucratic hurdles** across its
30-member alliance.]{.underline} As Nicholas Nelson of the Center for
European Policy Analysis (CEPA) notes, [for]{.underline} the [[DIANA and
NIF]{.underline}]{.mark} "[to succeed]{.underline}, [they [must address
**authority and budget concerns**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and then bring
in the right personnel to lead and staff them.]{.underline}" [Even so,
NATO is taking the proper steps to improve its scientific and
tech]{.underline}nological [capabilities. Its strategic documents
reflect the importance it is placing in these areas. By creating new
institutions, NATO is setting the foundation for further development and
expanded capabilities.]{.underline}

[Given the threats that adversaries pose to the alliance, maintaining
and improving its scientific and tech]{.underline}nological [prowess
will be **vital** to NATO's future success. [Strengthening]{.mark} these
areas [will boost **military effectiveness**, **deterrence**, and
**defense**]{.mark} and enhance private and public cooperative
advancements. [It will]{.mark} ultimately [give]{.mark} the alliance
[**more strategic flexibility** while improving]{.mark} NATO's
[**defenses** in]{.mark} areas **beyond the military**]{.underline},
[such as [**energy** and **cybersecurity**]{.mark} in the private
sector. [By continuing to **out-innovate**]{.mark} its
competitors]{.underline}, [[NATO will]{.mark} protect its **people** and
**infrastructure**]{.underline}, [and ensure that the alliance remains
prepared to [combat **any challenges from Russia or
China**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**military infrastructure** to facilitate rapid]{.mark} defense
[innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[including]{.mark} the adoption and
scaling of [emerging tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[. And [not all
that have]{.mark} such resources and knowledge [are **willing to share

allies]{.mark}---the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[, France,

Netherlands---**[already have national-focused approaches]{.mark}** to
the adoption of EDTs. By contrast, for most Central and Eastern
countries EDTs in defense are mainly a long-term prospect. Previous
challenges in integrating cyber capabilities into NATO operations,
persistent capability gaps among the allies, and slow standardization
procedures are a good indication of the magnitude of the
challenge]{.underline}, [which is acknowledged at the highest levels of
NATO decision-making.]{.underline}

[As Secretary-General Stoltenberg has stated, [a

[would **undermine interoperability** and **weaken**]{.mark} **alliance
[cohesion]{.mark}**[. In the context of the]{.mark} NATO AI and big data

military headquarters. Such agreement, when paired with improved
national capabilities, would contribute to deterrence by communicating
resolve to adversaries. [[Improved capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}

Participation of Other Allies

[[As an ally weighs a potential contribution]{.mark} to collective
defense]{.underline}, [[it is likely to consider **who else is
participating**.]{.underline}]{.mark}63 [Research on alliance
burden-sharing has focused on a mix]{.underline} \[end page 20\] \[Table
Omitted --- see URL\] [of rational calculations and the normative
considerations that states make.]{.underline} Some analysts have applied
collective action theory to explain why, during peacetime, smaller NATO
allies are likely to minimize contributions or freeride. If these allies
believe that others will provide collective defense---even if they do
not contribute---they have little to gain by burden-sharing. However,
this dynamic would be less applicable in the event of a conventional
Russian attack for two reasons. First, as detailed below, states that do
not contribute could be punished more harshly by other allies for
failing to respond to a Russian attack than they are in peacetime.
Second, each ally's contributions could materially affect the outcome if
the crisis were to escalate to a wider war.64 Put another way, in the
face of an overwhelming common security threat---direct conflict with
Russia---a freeriding approach could potentially be more costly for NATO
members than burden-sharing.65 \[end page 21\]

3.9. How to enhance EU-NATO complementarity on EDTs?

The [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} alliance [increasingly [sees itself as a
"**transatlantic forum**" on EDTs.]{.mark} This aim has been stressed
during the NATO 2030 reflection process. NATO fears that EDTs are
proliferating into the hands of adversaries]{.underline}, [and this is
eroding the alliance's military-tech]{.underline}nological [superiority.
NATO also recognizes that the growth of [EDTs pose]{.mark}s [a risk with
regard to **alliance cohesion** because **unequal development and
ownership**]{.mark} of EDTs [can lead to **lower interoperability** and
**higher tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[**gaps**.]{.mark} While the
alliance has a proven track record of developing standards, [NATO has
neither the **financial resources** nor **regulatory power** to take a
comprehensive lead]{.mark} on the question of EDTs. [This]{.mark}
situation [has]{.mark} even [given rise to]{.mark} new ideas such as a

The Issue

[Although U.S. strategic competition with China and Russia is often
presented as a challenge with **two separate fronts**,]{.underline} this
brief argues that [the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific theaters are
**increasingly linked**. Insofar as preserving a favorable balance of
power in these two regions hinges largely on **U.S.
power**]{.underline}, [and as long as they both continue to exercise a
significant pressure on U.S. defense resources]{.underline}, [their
alliance and deterrence architectures should be looked at from an
**inter-theater perspective**.]{.underline} Thus, [optimally managing a
two-front challenge would require a serious effort to **bridge U.S.-led
alliances** in both regions.]{.underline}

Introduction

[The war in Ukraine]{.underline}, [and the need to deter further Russian
aggression in Eastern Europe]{.underline}, [has triggered a debate about
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[' ability to adequately
resource a much-needed rebalance to Asia and prioritize strategic
competition with China.]{.underline} For some, Ukraine is a dangerous
distraction: the United States should avoid getting bogged down in
Europe, lest it incentivize Beijing to engage in opportunistic
aggression in Asia.1 According to this line of thinking, deterrence in
Asia, and the security of the United States' Indo-Pacific allies, hinges
on U.S. restraint in Ukraine and in Europe more broadly.2 Others,
however, argue that a hot war and the prospect of further military
aggression will inevitably compel the United States to strengthen its
posture in Europe in the foreseeable future.3 This does not mean that
Washington should take its eyes off China. Rather, it should prepare to
deter and win a war on two fronts simultaneously.4 A Russian failure in
Ukraine could conceivably change U.S. calculations over the medium term
and even lay the groundwork for a proper strategic rebalance to Asia.

Should the United States establish a clear priority between Russia and
China or go all in on both fronts? What are the implications of each
option for U.S. defense strategy? And where do the United States'
European and Asian allies come into the picture? U.S.-allied dominance
at sea and the preservation of favorable balances of power in Europe and
East Asia should be seen as interdependent concepts or parts of a
"geostrategic trinity" of power, upon which the open, rules-based
international system largely rests. [As long as preserving a balance of
power in Europe and East Asia hinges largely on U.S. power]{.underline},
[and as long as these two regions continue to exercise a significant
pressure on U.S. defense resources]{.underline}, [their alliance and
deterrence architectures will probably remain intertwined. The question
is **not** so much **which region matters most** or under which
circumstances. The [unraveling]{.mark} of the balance of power [in one
region would punch a hole in the]{.mark} U.S.-led forward [defense
perimeter]{.mark} in Eurasia, [endanger U.S.-allied dominance]{.mark} at
sea, [and]{.mark} eventually [threaten]{.mark} the balance in [the other
region.]{.mark} Hence the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates['
[European and Asian allies have a stake in]{.mark} the preservation of
favorable balances of power in [each other's region]{.mark} and in U.S.
maritime dominance more broadly. It is also why the [U.S.-led deterrence
and alliance architectures]{.mark} in Europe and Asia [should be looked
at from an **inter-theater perspective**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted the mobilization of countries
such as Japan, Australia, and South Korea]{.underline}, [who have joined
the sanctions imposed by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [and provided their
own support to Ukraine. Building on such political momentum would allow
to promote an inter-theater approach to deterrence and alliances in
Europe and East Asia.]{.underline} Critically, [such [an inter-regional
approach can]{.mark} allow the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and its allies to collectively navigate the two-front problem and
[adequately resource deterrence in Europe **and** East Asia]{.mark}
simultaneously. Even though mutual defense commitments may remain
intra-regional]{.underline}, [as opposed to inter-regional]{.underline},
[**[greater coordination between]{.mark} U.S.-led [alliances]{.mark} in
the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific** [could]{.mark} help [ensure]{.mark}
an **[optimal allocation of]{.mark} U.S. and allied [strategic
resources]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Specifically, both sets of
alliances should upgrade consultation mechanisms at the political and
military levels and apply an inter-theater lens to burden sharing, force
planning, and posture.

[[An inter-theater approach]{.mark} to capability development
[can]{.mark} help [preserve the **dominance of U.S.-led alliances** in
**both theaters**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even though some U.S.
capabilities are global, others will be theater-specific and require
adaptations. For instance, "theater-range" missiles may need to adapt to
specific range or platform requirements (i.e., sea-borne vs. land-borne)
depending on whether they are intended for Europe or Asia. This applies
to both offensive and defensive missiles. [[Including allies]{.mark} in
U.S.-led capability planning initiatives [can generate **economies of
scale**]{.mark} and make it easier for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to develop skeleton concepts that can draw on
allied support and participation to bring about appropriate adaptations
for each theater.]{.underline} Moreover, [[the need]{.mark} to preserve
dominance at sea and in other global commons [should]{.mark} also
[incentivize **inter-allied coop**]{.mark}eration [in developing]{.mark}
naval, air, cyber, and space [capabilities and
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Strengthening links between U.S.-led alliances in the Euro-Atlantic and
Indo-Pacific in the area of operational planning would give both sets of
allies greater insight into the military-strategic picture in each
other's region and how such a picture may affect U.S. and allied
planning in real time.]{.underline} It would also allow them to assess
possible implications for their home region and identify opportunities
to add value in each other's region, as well as in underpinning U.S. and
allied dominance at sea and in the other global commons. Thus, allies
could consider the establishment of permanent liaison officers from AP4
countries in Supreme Allied Command Europe and throughout NATO's command
structure, as well as a NATO liaison cell in U.S. Indo-Pacific Command,
and more joint exercises.42

Ultimately, [an effort [to **bridge U.S.-led alliances**]{.mark} in the
Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific [would]{.mark} help transcend the China
first vs. two-front war dilemma and allow the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies to [develop an optimal collective
strategy]{.mark} to underpin the geostrategic trinity of their power.
This becomes particularly relevant]{.underline} when the United States
and its allies face two strategic competitors in two distant regions
simultaneously and [[in light of **Sino-Russian strategic
coop**]{.mark}**eration**.]{.underline} Should one of those competitors
collapse, or should there be a breakdown in Sino-Russian ties, the need
for alliance bridging may indeed become less evident or urgent. Hence,
policymakers should pursue flexible and pragmatic approaches to bridging
allies that eschew creating new institutions and respect the primacy of
regional frameworks, which are arguably more lasting.

### 2AC --- No Strategic Autonomy Net-Benefit

#### [No Strategic Autonomy Net-Benefit]{.underline} --- it's [impossible]{.underline} and [counter-productive]{.underline}. 

**Davidson 22** --- Jason W. Davidson, Professor of Political Science
and International Affairs at the University of Mary Washington,
Nonresident Senior Fellow in the New American Engagement Initiative at
The Atlantic Council, holds a Ph.D. in Government from Georgetown
University, 2022 ("European Strategic Autonomy Is Dead," *The National
Interest*, June 28^th^, Available Online at
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/european-strategic-autonomy-dead-203222,
Accessed 07-15-2022)

On the eve of NATO's Madrid Summit, one fact of European security has
become increasingly clear: [[NATO is the only feasible guarantor
of]{.mark} the [security]{.mark} of European states
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}, [thus]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
European Union's ([EU]{.underline}) [objective of achieving [strategic
autonomy is **unlikely**]{.mark} **to become a reality [anytime
soon]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In the **early days** following Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}, [it would have been reasonable to expect the war
would provide the necessary impetus for the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [to finally achieve strategic autonomy.]{.underline}
Unity develops in response to a common threat and Russia's attack
demonstrated its aggressive intentions. Moreover, the Russian threat was
such a shock that it seemed to cause a "sea change" in defense policy
for many European governments. The Biden administration had already
rightfully signaled that it would welcome greater European
responsibility for defense and security, as it would allow the United
States to focus more on the greater threat posed by China. In a further
positive development, the EU published a "Strategic Compass," outlining
its plans for improved defense and security cooperation, only a month
after the Russo-Ukrainian War began.

[In **the months since**]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [it has
become clear that European strategic autonomy is **unlikely to come to
fruition anytime soon**: [the war]{.mark} has [**increased the stakes**
and **made apparent the risk**]{.mark} involved in forming an
alternative to NATO, major EU members [**France** and **Germany**
have]{.mark} acted in ways that [**cast doubt** on their ability to
lead, and **Sweden and Finland's NATO application** demonstrates]{.mark}
that **[the backing of the U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is **the only real
guarantee**]{.mark} against Russian aggression.]{.underline}

While European autonomy in defense and security has long been a goal,
President Donald Trump's criticism of NATO and expressed desire to
withdraw from the alliance, led many European policymakers to search for
alternatives to the Atlantic alliance. What do advocates of strategic
autonomy mean by the term? In a November 2019 interview with The
Economist Emmanuel Macron declared NATO's "brain death" and said "Europe
must become autonomous in terms of military strategy and capability,"
later claiming that "Europe has the capacity to defend itself." Within a
week of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Macron proclaimed that "Europe
must invest more in order to decrease its dependence on other continents
and to be able to decide for itself. In other words, it must become a
power that is both more independent and more sovereign." So, strategic
autonomy, in the view of its leading proponent, would mean an EU that is
capable of defending its members without assistance from the United
States.

Russia's attack on February 24, 2022, demonstrated aggressive intentions
fundamentally greater than anything it has done since the end of the
Cold War. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine suggested to Europeans
that a Russian attack on an EU or NATO member, while not likely, is no
longer unthinkable. Given this new reality, [the stakes of choosing the
right security architecture are higher than they have been for decades.
If European countries bet on [an]{.mark} unknown and [untested
EU]{.mark} for their defense]{.underline}, [they [would risk **attack**,
**territorial loss**, and]{.mark} even
[**subjugation**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Finally, while the early weeks of
the war demonstrated Russian military incompetence, experts warn that
Russia has learned from mistakes, retains destructive military
capabilities, and will likely use its oil and gas sales to rebuild its
war machine.

[[**France** and **Germany**]{.underline}]{.mark}---the EU's top two
economies, largest military spenders, and loudest advocates for
strategic autonomy---[[have]{.mark} acted in ways that have [made
strategic autonomy **less likely**.]{.mark}]{.underline} First, [many
European leaders]{.underline}---especially those bordering
Russia---[view French and German calls for Ukraine to make compromises
with Russia with great concern. From the perspective of those countries
most concerned with the Russian threat]{.underline}, [the appeal to a
diplomatic solution could mean they are forced to give up territory for
the sake of the greater good.]{.underline} When asked recently about
German mediation attempts, an Eastern European diplomat said "\[w\]e
don't need German protection; history proved it to be on the wrong side
of history." Second, [[there is a **well-documented gap** between the
military capacity]{.mark} of EU member states [and what they would need
to be]{.mark} truly [autonomous]{.mark} in defense. Despite **initial
indications** to the contrary]{.underline}, [it now seems increasingly
**unlikely** that Germany will engage in a significant change in its
defense spending and strategic culture]{.underline}, [which will thwart
the move towards European strategic autonomy.]{.underline} Aside from
the contribution Germany---as the EU's wealthiest member---will not make
toward enhanced European defense capacity, [its inaction will **signal**
to other Europeans that are still not bothered by the Russian threat
that it is fine to return to the pre-war levels of defense
spending.]{.underline} Finally, there is the issue of France's nuclear
arsenal. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has extended its
nuclear deterrent to cover NATO members]{.underline}, [whereas [France's
nuclear arsenal defends its territory]{.mark} and vital interests,
[**not the EU or NATO**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The recent decision by the governments of [**Sweden** and
**Finland**]{.mark} to apply for NATO membership [is the **death
knell**]{.mark} for EU strategic autonomy.]{.underline} Both countries
are EU members, so both should---in theory---be protected by the Lisbon
Treaty's Article 42 defense clause. Moreover, both countries understand
that the act of applying to NATO would draw Russia's ire and potential
coercive measures to keep them out of the alliance and impose costs on
them. They also knew that there would be at least a few months between
when they applied for membership and when they received the full
protection of NATO's Article V mutual defense clause (Turkey's
objections have extended that timeline). As such, [if they believed that
EU strategic autonomy could provide them with sufficient protection from
Russia in the near to medium term, it would have been rational to
continue to remain outside of NATO. But Sweden and Finland have chosen
otherwise.]{.underline} A May 2022 Swedish Foreign Affairs report
stated: "It is clear that there is a lack of political will among EU
Member States to develop collective defence within the EU." [While
[NATO]{.mark} certainly faces challenges, Sweden and Finland's
applications suggest the alliance [provides a **better security
blanket**]{.mark} against a Russian attack than the EU.]{.underline}

What if Donald Trump or a Trump-aligned, NATO-critical Republican wins
the 2024 U.S. presidential election? Wouldn't that outcome force
Europeans to return to strategic autonomy? First, given the American
public's bipartisan concern with the threat posed by Russia since its
attack on Ukraine, it would not be politically expedient for a
Republican nominee to emphasize criticisms of NATO in the way that Trump
did previously. Second, while Trump's rhetorical criticisms of NATO were
fierce, his administration's policies toward the alliance were quite
favorable. Finally, the Russo-Ukrainian War is likely to lead more NATO
states to meet the 2 percent of gross domestic product defense spending
goal, lessening one of Trump's most salient criticisms of the alliance.

[Given the **death** of EU strategic autonomy---and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [continued interest in
European security---[NATO will remain the **critical security
mechanism**]{.mark} for Europe. The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will have to **remain engaged in
Europe**]{.underline}, [even as it focuses more on Asia]{.underline},
[though it should be able to use the residual threat from Moscow to
leverage greater European contributions to their own
defense.]{.underline}

'Strategic autonomy'

So the second big piece of reframing has to involve European 'strategic
autonomy'. Long pursued by Macron, this has been given impetus by the
Zeitenwende (historical turn) declared by the German chancellor, Olaf
Scholz.

[[**Before** Putin attacked]{.mark} Ukraine, [one could argue that the
EU needed strategic autonomy]{.mark} because the US was no longer a
reliable ally, European capitalism needed to exert some sovereignty over
tech]{.underline}nology [and info]{.underline}rmation[, and the European
powers needed to 'take the strain' from America in deterring Russian
aggression. Europe would then find its own centre of gravity, in

[comply with]{.mark} criteria based on **civilian [safety
requirements]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} the most [common complaints.]{.mark}
Hence]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} current German procurement
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including industrial production
capacities]{.underline}, [[looks **ill-equipped to handle**]{.mark}
**even [more money]{.mark}** [without]{.mark} running the risk of

overall [absorption capacity **across all stages**]{.mark} of the
armament's life-cycle --- r]{.underline}esearch [and
d]{.underline}evelopment[, design, contractual negotiations, production,
certification, operation and maintenance, and disbursement --- [is
**limited**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Furthermore, and true to its roots, [Germany will likely retain its
restrictive arms-export policy.]{.underline} During the special
parliamentary session, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock not only used
her speech to explain why Germany greenlighted the arms exports to
Ukraine, but she also seized the opportunity to highlight the
exceptionalism of this decision. Societal pressure will grow as
increased domestic defense spending potentially alleviates export
dependencies and economic pressures for Germany's defense industry.
Moreover, as more and more E.U. and NATO allies are announcing national
spending increases, which traditionally generates strong demand for the
German defense industry, economic incentives for exports beyond E.U.,
NATO, and NATO-equivalent countries further decrease. Activists critical
of German arms exports have repeatedly urged Germany to focus on
domestic and allied markets, as further illustrated, for example, by a
recent study commissioned by Greenpeace. This is especially true as
German society and politicians are most critical of exports beyond
allied countries. However, [as seen in past years, [Germany's strict
export practice]{.mark}]{.underline} also **[[negatively impacts
multinational]{.mark} armaments [projects]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[resulting in **diplomatic grievances** with]{.mark} even its closest
[allies. The combination of these factors doesn't]{.mark} necessarily
[bode well for]{.mark} further defense industrial and armament
[coop]{.mark}eration [envisaged]{.mark}]{.underline}, [for

[NATO's]{.mark}]{.underline} new [Defense
[Accelerator]{.mark}]{.underline} for the North Atlantic, [which focuses
on intensifying transatlantic development in dual-use
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[Although important, [spending more]{.mark} on defense [is **not
enough**.]{.mark} For Scholz's Zeitenwende to deliver true change,
Germany needs to spend differently and embed the spending hike in a
broader national and international context.]{.underline}

A Fragmented, Applied Research

[The way the Italian defence establishment has managed
tech]{.underline}nological [innovation so far has a set of
implications.]{.underline} First, [the focus is on applied rather than
basic research]{.underline}, [usually involving an elevated]{.underline}
Technology Readiness Level ([TRL]{.underline})[.]{.underline} Secondly,
[[innovation is **fragmented across procurement
programmes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [thus [preventing]{.mark} both
[**cross-fertilization** and **economies of
scale**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thirdly, [[programmes are]{.mark} mainly
[attached to **one service**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as a result the
joint level inevitably receives less attention and
resources]{.underline}, [[to the detriment of **critical areas**]{.mark}
such as missile defence and the whole cyber domain including the
digitalisation of military equipment.]{.underline} Last but not least,
[the world of [defence]{.mark} in Italy [is]{.mark} relatively [globally
**closed to**]{.mark}]{.underline} Small and Medium Enterprises
(**[[SMEs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)[[, **start-ups** and
**mid-caps**]{.mark} companies operating in the civilian sector.
**[Overall]{.mark}**, because of this complex system where not all
incentives and priorities are aligned]{.underline}, [a long-term,
comprehensive strategy for defence [innovation is **very difficult** to
**achieve** and]{.mark}]{.underline}, [eventually]{.underline}, [to
[**implement**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The R&T funds not linked to a specific procurement are managed through
the Piano Nazionale di Ricerca Militare (PNRM). The PNRM is the Ministry
of Defence's national plan for military research: its budget is
extremely limited, about € 50 million per year, and it covers a
relatively high number of projects. \[end page 3\]

[[An additional factor complicates]{.mark} defence [innovation]{.mark}
in Italy: defence [investments are **split** between the MoD and]{.mark}
the [M]{.mark}inistry of [E]{.mark}conomic
[D]{.mark}evelopment]{.underline}, with the former allocating around €
2-2.5 billion per year to defence procurement involving Italian
industries. Such a funding does include R&T activities, but its exact
extent is unclear given that such activities are included in various
forms within single procurement programmes. [The two ministries have to
cooperate both at the political and practical level to finance projects

On March 12, U.S. president Biden, Japanese prime minister Suga, Indian
prime minister Modi, and Australian prime minister Morrison attended the
first leader-level summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or
Quad. The resulting joint statement pledged to deepen the nascent
grouping, which arose in response to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami but
lay dormant from 2008 to 2017, and to expand its focus beyond military
exercises and humanitarian aid. Notably, [the **Quad** leaders
established]{.underline} three [working groups to collaborate
on]{.underline} Covid-19 [vaccine distribution, climate action, and
**critical and emerging tech**]{.underline}nologies[. The
tech]{.underline}nology [working group is the latest of several recent
efforts to formalize cooperation among like-minded countries on
protecting, regulating, and developing strategic
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline} Since the election of President
Biden, such proposals have gained steam, ranging from new multilateral
bodies to narrowly scoped technical efforts. [Yet [there remain
**significant hurdles**]{.mark} to the sort of broad
tech]{.underline}nology [partnerships envisioned.]{.underline}

Q1: What is the impetus for cooperation on critical technologies?

A1: The United States and its allies have a history of joint research
and protection of critical technologies, dating back to British and
Canadian support for the Manhattan Project. Today, China's rapid
technological advancement and ambitious industrial strategy have raised
concerns in Washington and other allied capitals that Beijing will lead
the deployment of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence
and quantum computing, which could have problematic economic, strategic,
and human rights implications.

U.S. policymakers worry that Chinese government-backed firms could
undercut U.S. competitors, potentially pushing them out of business and
eroding the defense innovation base. In addition, the ongoing
semiconductor shortage and recurring fears that Beijing could limit
access to strategic minerals have bolstered calls for secure, resilient
supply chains. Finally, Washington and its allies have a shared interest
in ensuring that the development of emerging technologies, as well as
the evolving standards and regulations that govern them, align with
democratic values.

Q2: What is being proposed?

A2: Given the international nature of global technology supply chains
and talent, multilateral cooperation can more effectively address
concerns posed by China. The Biden administration has made such
coordination the cornerstone of its foreign policy agenda, and U.S.
allies and partners have similarly emphasized the need to work together.

The Biden administration's Interim National Security Strategic Guidance
released in early March envisions joining with "like-minded democracies
to develop and defend trusted critical supply chains and technology
infrastructure," as well as "promoting shared norms and forg\[ing\] new
agreements on emerging technologies." The U.S. Congress has taken
initial steps to support such cooperation. The 2021 National Defense
Authorization Act authorized two funds for joint development and
production of telecommunications and microelectronics technologies,
although these have yet to receive appropriations. Several pieces of
pending legislation would support broader cooperation. For example, the
bipartisan Democracy Technology Partnership Act would seek to align
standard-setting, data governance, tech transfer policies, supply chain
reorganization, and research and development (R&D) promotion among
advanced democracies.

U.S. allies have made other proposals in the spirit of cooperation. In
its December 2020 New EU-U.S. Agenda for Global Change, the European
Commission proposed an EU-U.S. Trade and Technology Council to
strengthen joint technological leadership. The United Kingdom's March
2021 Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign
Policy endeavors to "develop a new framework for international science
partnerships" and put technology at the core of alliances. Japan
maintains roughly 160 joint scientific research collaboration projects
with the United States and has been supportive of expanding the Quad
format to cover emerging technology.

Outside policy experts have also tabled various ideas, such as an
informal "Technology 10" forum that would coordinate on global standards
and supply chains with variable, issue-specific membership.

Q3: Where do the proposals diverge?

A3: While all under the aegis of allied technology cooperation, the
proposals differ on scope. Most cover technology protection and
standard-setting, but some also include joint development efforts and
even competition policy harmonization.

Among official proposals, the European Commission's Trade and Technology
Council is the broadest. The plan encompasses "developing compatible
standards and regulatory approaches for new technologies, ensuring
critical supply chain security, deepening research collaboration, and
promoting innovation and fair competition." Notably, the document links
trade and technology issues and emphasizes the imperative of "solving
bilateral trade irritants that weaken our strategic partnership." Unlike
other frameworks, the European Commission's proposes that competition
policy---a complicated subject for Washington---be discussed in a
"transatlantic dialogue on the responsibility of online platforms and
Big Tech."

The Biden administration has not yet put forward a detailed, public
vision for technology cooperation. Several senior White House officials
worked on technology collaboration frameworks before joining the
administration, and early reporting indicates that they will adopt a
flexible approach, organizing variable coalitions of industry-leading
countries. However, the specifics remain vague, with the potential scope
of such groups ranging from technical standard- and regulatory-setting
partnerships, technology-control coordination, alignment of supply-chain
management, and more ambitious joint R&D efforts.

[[The Quad]{.mark}'s emerging and critical tech]{.underline}nology
[working group represents the first concrete step toward a "tech
alliance," but it [has a **much narrower scope**]{.mark} than the EU and
U.S. proposals.]{.underline} The White House factsheet lists five areas
of focus: principles for technology design, development, and use;
technology standards development; telecommunications deployment and
diversification of suppliers; monitoring critical and emerging
technology trends and opportunities; and critical technology supply
chains. [At this point, the [action items are mostly
**dialogues**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and leaders will likely prioritize
the Quad's joint vaccine efforts in the short term.

Q4: [What are the **roadblocks** to deeper cooperation?]{.underline}

A4: Behind all the enthusiasm for cooperation, [[there are three primary
obstacles]{.mark} to a potential "tech alliance": [**different
interpretations** of]{.mark} the [challenges posed by **China**,
**existing policy irritants**, and **economic competition**]{.mark}
among U.S. allies and partners.]{.underline}

While [Washington and its allies]{.underline} share anxieties over
China's rise, they [view the specific challenges from different
perspectives.]{.underline} In his first speech on the Biden
administration's foreign policy vision, Secretary of State Blinken
labeled China "the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century" and
recognized that the bilateral relationship "will be competitive when it
should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must
be." Brussels adopted similar language in its 2019 Strategic Outlook on
China, which identified Beijing as simultaneously a cooperation partner,
negotiating partner, economic competitor, and systemic rival. Yet [the
transatlantic powers have prioritized **different aspects** of the
multifaceted relationship]{.underline}, [with Brussels concluding a
hard-fought comprehensive agreement on investment with
Beijing]{.underline} just [weeks before Blinken said he agreed
with]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline} administration's determination
[that the Chinese government is committing genocide in Xinjiang. Other
vital partners have been careful not to publicly oppose
China.]{.underline} While the readout of recent U.S.-Japan officials'
meetings heavily criticized Beijing's behavior, the summary of
U.S.-Korea meetings the following day did not mention China.

**[Existing policy [disputes and differences]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [if
left unresolved]{.underline}, [[will]{.mark} also **[hinder]{.mark}
efforts** at [coop]{.mark}eration. The E]{.underline}uropean
[C]{.underline}ommission's Trade and Technology Council agenda [urges
resolution of "**[bilateral trade irritants]{.mark}**,"
[refer]{.mark}ring [to **U.S. national security tariffs**]{.mark} on
European steel and aluminum and retaliatory duties over subsidies to
Boeing and Airbus. [A greater test]{.mark} for policymakers [lies with
reconciling **divergent visions of data governance and competition
policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which will shape the nature of emerging
tech]{.underline}nology [development.]{.underline}

Finally, [while [allies]{.mark} share strategic interests, they are also
fierce economic competitors. Countries in a potential tech alliance [are
**racing with each other** to lead]{.mark} in emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies, with large public investments in batteries,
artificial intelligence, and semiconductor manufacturing capacity, among
others. [[Such efforts could be interpreted as **discriminatory
industrial policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}; Brussels has already voiced
concerns that recent "Buy American" initiatives could violate World
Trade Organization rules.

While these challenges are significant, they are not insurmountable.
Views of China have been converging across key U.S. technology partners,
albeit at different speeds. There have been positive early indications
from the Biden administration that it is willing to compromise on
long-standing U.S.-EU irritants, such as a global digital services tax
and the Boeing-Airbus dispute. [Going forward, [how]{.mark} the
[Biden]{.mark} admin]{.underline}istration [[approaches **data
governance** and]{.mark} builds out its **["Buy American"]{.mark}
program** [could determine whether deeper]{.mark} allied
tech]{.underline}nology [[coop]{.mark}eration [is
possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}

One specific facet of U.S. China policy that also blurs the Trump-Biden
distinction is strengthening the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, known
as the Quad. Comprised of the United States, Australia, India, and
Japan, it emerged in 2007 as a brainchild of Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and held its first summit this March, after which its members
issued a joint statement. Following the conclave, U.S. Secretary of
State Anthony Blinken and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin
traveled to northeast Asia to maintain the momentum. Austin also added
India to his itinerary. Chinese officials promptly lambasted the Quad as
the real threat to peace and even warned smaller Indo-Pacific
countries---Bangladesh for one---not to cooperate with it, essentially
repeating the message it delivered to the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) last fall.

The Quad's emergence shouldn't surprise Beijing. Rising powers routinely
evoke countervailing coalitions, and shared anxiety about an adversary
can contribute to their cohesion---but that's just a starting point.
[The Quad's problem is it]{.underline} doesn't have much else to run on
and hence [will ultimately amount to U.S. power with a multilateral
veneer.]{.underline}

[Of the Quad's members, [**only** the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[can maintain a]{.mark} sizeable, strong,
and enduring [military presence]{.mark} in the E]{.underline}ast
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea [and]{.underline} the
[S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, the most
likely venues for confrontation with China. The U.S. military has power
projection forces, sea-based air support, surface ships and submarines,
and regional bases to support deterrence and warfighting. Beijing's
nuclear weapons may serve as instruments of coercion against Japan and
Australia, perhaps even nuclear-armed India, but won't be credible
against the United States, which has many more of them than China does.

In a nonnuclear clash with China, something no sane person should want,
the United States might win, or at least end the war, on favorable terms
(although war games suggest otherwise). But even if it could narrowly
prevail, in the last few decades, the People's Liberation Army has
acquired the muscle needed to ensure the United States pays a heavy
price in the event of a war; and this trend will continue. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will]{.underline} nevertheless
[remain a formidable adversary for China, but [the]{.mark} relevant
[question]{.mark}]{.underline} here [[is what the]{.mark} rest of the
[Quad can bring to the table. **Not much**]{.mark}**, [hype
notwithstanding.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[For example, in one standard measure of power, India's population
nearly equals China and because of a higher fertility rate will soon
surpass it. Although population size can be an asset, much depends on
the human capital developed with it. Unfortunately [for
India]{.mark},]{.underline} on that score, [[China is]{.mark} by most
measures]{.underline}---longevity, levels of education, technical skill,
caloric intake, and health---[[far ahead.]{.mark} Ditto for
**[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nology, [where the [gap will
**grow**]{.mark}: Not only does China's GDP exceed India's by a factor
of four, but Beijing devotes 2 percent of its GDP to
tech]{.underline}nological [r]{.underline}esearch [and
d]{.underline}evelopment [compared to India's 0.7 percent. On private,
governmental, and university r]{.underline}esearch [and
d]{.underline}evelopment [combined, India spends nearly \$48 billion
annually and has 156 million researchers per million people. The
equivalent sums for China are \$346 billion and 1,089 researchers.
[Compare]{.mark} the two countries in internet availability; the quality
of schools, universities, and infrastructure; and achievements in
[cutting edge tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies (robotics, artificial
intelligence, 5G, and supercomputers---of which China has nearly twice
as many as the United States), [[and China's **overwhelming edge**
becomes apparent]{.mark} again.]{.underline}

[These differences help explain China's clear advantages over India in
power projection and quality of armaments as well as reconnaissance,
target acquisition, and cyberwarfare systems. And because of its overall
tech]{.underline}nological [superiority and a military budget almost
four times bigger than India's, [China will **maintain** and]{.mark}
even [**increase** its lead.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, Indian
forces must travel more than 2,350 miles to reach the South China Sea
while Chinese troops sit atop India's vast northern frontier. [So [it's
hard to imagine]{.mark} precisely [how India can help]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[deter]{.underline}]{.mark},
**[[let alone defeat]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[China.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Perhaps no East Asian country (leaving aside Taiwan) worries more about
China's resurgence than Japan for obvious historical and geographical
reasons. Yet [Japan has some big advantages compared to
India.]{.underline} Although Japan's GDP is less than 40 percent of
China's, it still ranks third in the world and is 2.5 times greater per
capita. The quality of Japan's human capital is superb, and it is also a
front-rank technological power with a vast pool of skilled labor and
scientific expertise.

As for the military side of the ledger, [[Japan's]{.mark}
S]{.underline}elf-[D]{.underline}efense [F]{.underline}orces [are
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologically [[advanced]{.underline}]{.mark},
and critical assessments conclude its sophisticated defense industries
produce world-class high-tech armaments. [[Yet China spends **five times
as much**]{.mark} on the P]{.underline}eople's [L]{.underline}iberation
[A]{.underline}rmy, [which has many more weapons essential to success in
war.]{.underline} China's leaders also have pushed military
modernization relentlessly, and although Japan has increased its defense
budget for nine successive years, military spending has been less than 1
percent of GDP for nearly 60 years. Tokyo could, in principle, make the
political decision to increase this proportion substantially, but
there's no evidence of any such move on the horizon. If Japan opts for
continuity and joins an anti-China military coalition in East Asia, it
will be taking big risks.

Since Japan's Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security with the United
States doesn't obligate the Self-Defense Forces to help the United
States in a war with China regardless of the circumstances (note the
wording of Article V), Japan would risk exposure to Chinese missiles and
airstrikes if it went beyond its treaty obligations. Not surprisingly,
despite Washington's call for a common front, Tokyo has refused to
commit to help defend Taiwan, something Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga made clear following his April meeting with Biden and
despite the reference to Taiwan (an anodyne call for "peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait") in their joint statement. U.S.
officials were doubtlessly disappointed, but [[given **strategic
realities**, why would Japan roll the dice when it can count on U.S.
protection]{.mark} without doing so[?]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Quad's fourth member,
[[can't]{.mark} really [beef up the group either.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Its navy must sail more than 3,000 miles to reach the South China Sea,
500 miles more to get to Taiwan. Once there, it would have to contend
with China's missiles, submarines, and aircraft as well as Chinese
operations aimed at severing the sea lines of communication supplying
Australian forces. True, Australian warships have sailed the South China
Sea since World War I, but in the last few decades, China, no longer
weak, has transformed the local balance of power. Although Australian
naval vessels joined U.S., Indian, and Japanese ships for the Malabar
exercises (which started in 1992) on two occasions---2007 and
2020---Australia's navy lacks the punch to ensure maritime missions
against China are something other than a U.S. undertaking. The apparent
enthusiasm of Campbell and U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan
for a more expansive Australian naval strategy won't change that.
Although Australians increasingly distrust China and consider it a
threat, in a recent Lowy Institute poll, 57 percent wanted Australia to
stay out of any Sino-American conflict.

Perhaps it's wrong to judge the Quad in purely military terms; after
all, strategy doesn't reduce solely to brute force. Yet a wider view
doesn't change the overall picture. [[If the Quad is]{.mark} also
[to]{.mark} be a political partnership aimed at [counter]{.mark}ing
[China]{.mark}'s growing influence in East Asia, [**what exactly** will
it]{.mark}s members [do]{.mark} to achieve that goal]{.underline}, [[and
what will be the **division of labor**?]{.mark} How will the Quad
overcome ASEAN's evident reluctance to get sucked into the intensifying
rivalry between China and its adversaries? Perhaps the]{.underline}
United States' [Quad partners could help exert economic pressure on
Beijing, but given their dependence on Chinese trade and investments as
well as vulnerability to retaliation]{.underline}, [[it's hard to see
them doing that **except episodically and
delicately**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Australia, 39 percent of whose
exports go to China compared to less than 4 percent to the United
States, has already experienced such blowback after it banned Chinese
telecommunications giant Huawei from 5G projects, criticized Beijing's
behavior in Hong Kong and Xinjiang, and called for investigating the
origins of COVID-19. China imposed multiyear tariff hikes on key
Australian exports, including wine (more than 200 percent) and barley
(80 percent). Moreover, rock lobsters---96 percent of which was exported
to China---were blocked by inspections; several meat producers were shut
out; and ships carrying coal, barred from offloading their cargo, were
stranded for months. Australia didn't cave, but Beijing didn't expect
that. Its goal was to send a message---not just to Canberra.

[The Quad won't disappear]{.underline}; it will hold summits, issue
statements, and stage naval exercises. [But [those who want it to become
central]{.mark} to Washington's neo-containment strategy [are **deluding
themselves**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Japanese Prime Minister
Yoshihide Suga and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi received the
red-carpet treatment at the White House last week for the first
in-person meeting of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue. President
Biden's decision to host the summit comes about six months after the
Quad released a joint leaders statement pledging to "commit to promoting
a free, open rules-based order" in the Indo-Pacific region.

For Biden, the leaders' summit is a golden opportunity to elevate a
broad theme of his presidency: utilizing international partnerships to
manage the challenges of the 21st century, in particular China's quest
to become Asia's dominant power. But [if the Biden
admin]{.underline}istration [seeks to turn the Quad into an anti-China
balancing coalition or]{.underline}, more dramatically, [a new NATO in
Asia, it will be setting itself up for **disappointment**. While
Australia, Japan and India all have strong disagreements with China and
are growing increasingly concerned about Beijing's behavior in the
region, [none]{.mark} of these countries [seem]{.mark} especially
[interested in **allowing Washington to dictate**]{.mark} **its
[policy]{.mark}** in Asia. Unlike Washington, [the Japanese, Indians and
Australians]{.mark} live in the Indo-Pacific and [have to be
**especially careful before rocking the boat**]{.mark} with
Beijing.]{.underline}

As China's economic and military strength grows, the nation is getting
more assertive as it moves to protect its own interests. Last year,
Chinese naval vessels sailed in the waters of the Japanese-administered
Senkaku islands for 333 consecutive days, deployments that continue to
test Tokyo's defensive measures and response time. Japan's Defense
Ministry, in its most recent annual white paper, stressed that "Chinese
military trends...have become a matter of grave concern to the region."
India, meanwhile, is still facing off with tens of thousands of Chinese
soldiers on the other side of its disputed Himalayan border, where there
were clashes last year. China is also continuing its campaign of
economic pressure against Australia, adopting tariffs and import
restrictions on everything from Australian wine and barley to coal and
seafood.

These problems aside, [[Australia, Japan and India recognize their
friction with China would **get even worse** should they use the
Quad]{.mark} as a vessel [to confront]{.mark} Beijing. This is
especially true in New Delhi]{.underline}, [which is careful to avoid
picking sides between the world's two greatest powers. [Historically
paranoid about U.S.]{.mark} security [promises, India is
following]{.mark} a path of **[multi-alignment]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[which encourages the improvement of relations with as many countries as
possible in order to preserve flexibility, keep its options open, and
retain freedom of movement in a tricky region of the world. [For India
to follow Washington's lead]{.mark} or throw its weight fully in the
U.S. camp would rip that doctrine apart. It [would]{.mark} also [have
**dangerous economic consequences**]{.mark} for India at a time when its
trade relationship with China has reached record levels]{.underline}
(\$57.48 billion) in the first quarter.

[Japan]{.underline} has longstanding territorial arguments with Beijing
and [is no doubt becoming more outspoken about Taiwan]{.underline},
perhaps China's most sensitive issue. The Japanese defense budget has
also gotten larger every year for the last nine straight years, driven
in large part by China's saber-rattling. [Yet [just because the Japanese
are purchasing more F-35's,]{.mark} long-range [missiles and warships
doesn't mean Tokyo is looking for a fight]{.mark} --- especially a fight
[that would jeopardize the]{.mark} very export markets that undergird
Japan's \$5 trillion [economy.]{.mark} With China consuming more than 20
percent of Japan's total exports last year, Tokyo's limitations are
quite real.]{.underline}

[Australia is arguably the one member of the Quad that may be
sympathetic to using the multilateral forum to push back against
China.]{.underline} Canberra clearly had China in mind when it decided
to opt-out of a diesel-powered submarine deal with France in favor of
U.S. and British nuclear propulsion technology. While senior Biden
administration officials were insisting that the new AUKUS security pact
between the U.S., the U.K. and Australia wasn't about any one country,
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne all but stated openly
that China's behavior was the genesis of the arrangement.

[Even so, [Australia isn't in the position to compete]{.mark} with China
militarily --- certainly not [without substantial U.S.]{.mark} military
and logistical [assistance.]{.mark}]{.underline} The South China Sea is
roughly 3,000 miles away from Australia, which means the Australian navy
would need to go to extraordinary lengths just to become a serious
contributor to a hypothetical anti-China military coalition. The
economics of such a decision wouldn't be lost on the Australian
government; at \$245 billion, China accounted for 31 percent of
Australia's total trade last year. If China was willing to levy trade
restrictions in retaliation for Australia's call for an international
investigation into the coronavirus pandemic, it's not difficult to
envision Beijing taking even more strident action against the Australian
economy if Canberra outsourced its China policy to Washington.

[None of this is to argue that the Quad is **useless**. To the extent
common interests bind the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[,
Australia, Japan and India together]{.underline}, [a regional forum such
as the Quad can be a force multiplier]{.underline}, [providing all four
nations with the opportunity to collaborate and sync their approaches.
But [Biden would be wise to **avoid transforming this**]{.mark}
**multilateral [club into a formal]{.mark} security
[alliance]{.mark}**[. The other members **aren't interested in choosing
sides**.]{.mark} And [Washington **shouldn't force them to**]{.mark}
**do so**.]{.underline}

#### [Economic interdependence with China]{.underline} prevents Quad balancing.

Contradictory," *Time*, March 18^th^, Available Online at

[The clarity with which Biden is mending fences with traditional allies
is commendable. But the same can't be said of the fancy new Asian mega
alliance touted as the centerpiece of his Asia play.]{.underline} Biden
has cemented an informal grouping of four maritime democracies in the
Indo-Pacific region. After over a decade of dithering, the leaders of
the U.S., Australia, Japan and India summitted for the first
time---albeit virtually---as a strategic bloc last week.
[The]{.underline} so-called Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or
[Quad]{.underline}, [is supposedly an Asian Nato that will act as a
bulwark against a rising and assertive China. But [its **confusing
alliance logic**, **foundational contradictions** and **deliberate
ambiguity** make it]{.mark} more like that [king of **multilateral
duds**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [BRICS]{.underline} (Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa)[---a grouping of nations with nothing in common
besides an acronym plucked out of a Goldman Sachs report.]{.underline}

[The **[hype aside]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[Quad]{.mark} in reality
[bears no resemblance to Nato.]{.mark} The latter represented a grand
strategy of culturally similar Western nations with a mutual history of
trust and cooperation forged through conflicts and crises. Nato
countries equally shared a perception of Moscow as a
threat]{.underline}, [resulting in a clear strategy of countering and
containing the Soviet Union. Zero commercial entanglement between Nato
and the insular Soviet bloc made the goal of containment an
uncomplicated exercise.]{.underline}

[Contrast that with [Quad]{.mark}]{.underline}, or even the broader
Indo-Pacific region, [where all [countries share critical]{.mark}
economic [interdependence with China.]{.mark} China is Japan's largest
export market and trading partner]{.underline}, representing more than a
fifth of Japan's total trade. [China is also the largest trading partner
of Australia]{.underline}, accounting for about 30 percent of
Australia's trade with the world. Nearly 40 per cent of Australian goods
exports go to China, which in turn supplies 27 percent of all goods
imported into Australia. [Even for India]{.underline}, which has a live
boundary dispute with China that flared up in a bloody conflict in the
Himalayas last year, [China is the largest trading partner.]{.underline}
Total imports from China are more than India's combined purchases from
the U.S. and the U.A.E., its second and third largest trade partners.

**[[Intertwined economic interests]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[along with
the risk of]{.mark} a **[Chinese blowback]{.mark}** to perceived
encirclement]{.underline}, [[meant Quad never]{.mark} quite [took
off]{.mark} after it was established in 2004 as an ad hoc
group]{.underline} to deal with the devastation of the Boxing Day
tsunami. Championed by Japanese leader Shinzo Abe, it had its first
meeting in 2007 as an informal strategic group. The on-again, off-again
Quad was revived by the Trump administration in 2017, after a decade in
cold storage, as tensions between China and its neighbors mounted. But
[the old hesitancy lingers.]{.underline}

A joint statement was issued after the members met last Friday but it
made no mention of China---the very reason why the group supposedly
exists. A joint op-ed issued by the four leaders similarly danced around
the inconvenient topic of China, focusing instead on COVID-19, vaccines,
climate change and assorted generalities such as "challenges presented
by new technologies."

This week, while visiting Tokyo, [Secretary Bilken warned China against
using "coercion and aggression." But the U.S. is an exception. Other
[Quad members avoid attacking China directly]{.mark}]{.underline}, [or
even naming it as an adversary]{.underline}, [[lest it offends
Beijing.]{.mark} As a group, they take pains to make the
point---unconvincingly---that Quad is not aimed at any one
state.]{.underline} They use phrases like "rules-based regional order"
and "shared challenges" as codes to refer to China. But it begs the
question of how one tackles a problem if it can't even be plainly
identified or isn't pressing enough to rally against unequivocally. It
is also not clear why countries like Vietnam, the Philippines and
Indonesia have stayed away from Quad if a united front against a
domineering China is really the need of the hour for Asia.

[Unclear]{.underline} too [is the emphasis on "democratic values" as
Quad's binding ethos. Using democracy as the basis for alliance in one
region sits at odds with America's partnerships in]{.underline} other
parts of the world, notably [the Middle East.]{.underline} The Quad
summit, which came close on the heels of a considered decision by Biden
not to order action against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for
his murderous ways, only highlighted this duality.

The contradictions don't end there. [Even within the Indo-Pacific
region, well-entrenched democracies like [**South Korea** and **New
Zealand** are outside]{.mark} Quad. India]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [is a key member because its blue-water naval capacity outweighs
its increasingly shallow democratic credentials.]{.underline} Assaults
on civil liberties, political rights and minorities have increased
noticeably in recent years under the watch of Prime Minister Narendra
Modi's Hindu nationalist government. Only a day before the Quad summit,
Sweden's V-Dem Institute, which tracks rights and democracies worldwide,
declared in its latest report that India had turned into an "electoral
autocracy". Earlier in the month, US-based non-profit Freedom House
downgraded India from a free democracy to a "partly free" country. [The
presence of a country with rapidly shrinking freedoms doesn't do credit
to a bloc supposedly founded on democratic values and demanding a "free,
open and inclusive Indo-Pacific."]{.underline}

How an ill-defined intergovernmental grouping with credibility issues
and devoid of a clear mandate is perceived by the Chinese will become
evident as National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary Blinken
meet their Chinese counterparts Yang Jiechi and Foreign Minister Wang Yi
this week in Anchorage, Alaska for a new round of formal talks between
the two estranged powers. Quad may give the Biden Administration a
strong hand in the negotiations---if Beijing accepts the alliance as
proof of Washington's ability to still lead in Asia. But beyond that,
[it's difficult to see how the quad]{.underline}rilateral [is square
with Asia's needs.]{.underline}

[[China grumps that the Quad]{.underline}]{.mark}, a league of
like-minded Indo-Pacific democracies, [[is an "Asian NATO"]{.mark} or
"mini-NATO" hellbent on "containing" China.]{.underline}

**[[If only.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Now, Beijing is not entirely wrong to liken the Quad to the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. [Quad
governments]{.underline}---representing India, Australia, Japan, and the
United States---[sometimes do things reminiscent of the Atlantic
alliance.]{.underline} For instance, the four Quad navies just finished
up with this year's Malabar exercise in the Arabian Sea, showing they
can work together and push back as China tries to make itself a serious
if not dominant player in the Indian Ocean region. NATO navies commonly
maneuver together, casting a counterweight to Russian ambitions in the
Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas.

[But]{.underline} one of these things is not like the other. In reality,
[[the Quad is a **loose consortium**]{.mark}, [not a **standing
alliance** anchored by a **collective defense
treaty**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The arrangement bears more resemblance to
the pre-World War I "entente cordiale" than to NATO. In April 1904 the
French and British governments signed a series of agreements settling
long-standing colonial quarrels. Setting aside centuries of
on-again-off-again enmity, the two democracies drew together against the
common danger manifest in autocratic Germany.

Kaiser Wilhelm II and his lieutenants repeatedly sought to break the
entente in ensuing years, yet their bellicose diplomatic methods only
cemented it. French ally Russia ultimately joined in, and the "Triple
Entente" was on. As a result, a coalition---not a formal
alliance---squared off against imperial Germany and its allies in 1914.
Pre-war European alliance politics should come as cold comfort to
Beijing. It shows that an overbearing power can prompt its opponents to
make a common cause even when no mutual defense accord binds them to do
so.

It also shows they can win.

NATO itself is something of an anomaly, as indeed is the array of
alliances the United States has headed since 1945. Namely, the
protracted strategic competition known as the Cold War lurched into
being during the immediate aftermath of a system-shattering global war.
The victorious World War II allies fell out against one another in the
months after peace came. The Iron Curtain descended across Europe while
America sought to rally the noncommunist world to oppose Soviet
expansionism.

The anomaly is this. U.S. forces were already on the ground in
war-stricken parts of the world, helping enforce the peace and
reconstruct devastated countries. Allies did not invite America to
construct and garrison bases on their soil during peacetime. That would
have been a tough sell with host governments and peoples. U.S. forces
came as conquerors; they stayed to hedge against fresh aggression. Facts
on the ground simplified the challenge of forging Cold War alliances.

In a real sense, then, U.S. containment strategy was an artifact of
World War II.

Lord "Pug" Ismay, the first secretary-general of NATO, encapsulated the
alliance's rationale breezily but accurately: its reason for being was
to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down. Keep
being the keyword. The Americans were already in; they did not have to
be invited in. That made it politically easier for allied governments to
ask them to stay, helping keep the Soviets behind the Iron Curtain and
hold down new militarism in Germany.

The American presence was the status quo---not some radical break from
the status quo. And it's easier to defend an established status quo than
to disturb one.

Similar logic held in Asia, where the defeat of Japan splintered the
Japanese Empire into its constituent parts, many---including Japan
itself---under direct U.S. military occupation. The U.S.-Japan security
alliance was a kind of bilateral NATO meant to keep the Russians and
Chinese out, the Americans in, and the Japanese down. South Koreans
didn't need to be kept down. After being ravaged by World War II and the
Korean War, though, they consented to a strong U.S. military presence to
keep North Koreans and their communist backers out and Americans in.

Lord Ismay's quip furnishes a powerful instrument for evaluating
U.S.-led alliances past, present, and future. That instrument indicates
that the Quad stands apart from long-standing alliances. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is not an occupying power in
Quad members. Its presence in Japan long ago evolved into a mutual
arrangement.]{.underline} Indeed, the U.S.-Japanese duo is more an
alliance of equals by the day.

[[Australia is]{.mark} arguably [America's closest friend]{.mark} on the
planet [yet remains reluctant to permit a standing presence that might
entangle Canberra]{.mark} in adventures it prefers to
avoid.]{.underline} The Australian government does allow U.S. Marine
contingents to deploy to the northern harbor of Darwin on a rotating
basis. Still, the situation bears scant resemblance to Europe or East
Asia during the early Cold War.

[And [India? **Fuggedaboutit**.]{.mark}]{.underline} New Delhi pioneered
nonalignment during the Cold War. It had an occasionally fraught
relationship with the United States (and a cozy one with the Soviet
Union) whose legacy the partners are only now transcending. And [[a
tradition of autonomy is etched on Indian strategic culture. India
regards itself as a benign hegemon]{.mark} over the Indian Ocean region.
[No hegemon]{.mark} readily [submits to an alliance headed by
outsiders]{.mark}]{.underline}, [let alone allows outsiders to establish
a standing military presence on its territory.]{.underline} Only under
extreme duress would New Delhi break with strategic autonomy.

[[**The Quad is no NATO**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Avoiding the China Trap

The bottom line is this: [to endure and meaningfully solve problems,
[the Quad needs to shift]{.mark} its focus from its novel form of
dialogue [toward **joint functional action**]{.mark} by the group
[on]{.mark} the most [pressing priorities]{.mark} that [others in the
region]{.mark} now [face. If other countries]{.mark} in Asia [view the
Quad as]{.mark} **little more than [a talk shop to discuss]{.mark} the
looming risks posed by [China's rise]{.mark}** while occasionally
holding joint military exercises, [it is **unlikely**]{.mark} that other
[countries will see its utility or view it as a model]{.mark} for their
own choices and conduct.]{.underline}

Of course, Beijing's actions toward Australia and India over the last
year highlight the benefits of solidarity among like-minded partners.
But [[the rest of Asia is **less focused** on]{.mark} the Quad's
problems with Beijing and the [security]{.mark} dimensions of its
partnership [than]{.mark} on grappling with an array of daily challenges
and pressing, long-term [**development priorities**. To
lead]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the Quad]{.mark} countries [must
demonstrate in **deed**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[not just
word]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[that they are making]{.mark} major
[contributions to solving **the**]{.mark} **larger [economic,
transnational, and environmental challenges]{.mark}** [that
preoccupy]{.mark} nearly **[everyone else]{.mark}** in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}

If it does so successfully, the Quad can comprise the firm core of an
elastic regional architecture. Ultimately, [[the priority]{.mark} today
[should **not** be on countering China]{.mark} for its own sake but on
increasing areas of alignment and cohesion with a larger community of
potential problem-solving partners. That is the best path for advancing
the interests of the Quad countries, preserving security, and promoting
development in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}

[[India has expended]{.mark} a great [deal]{.mark} of [energy and

[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rab [[E]{.underline}]{.mark}mirates
[[announced]{.underline}]{.mark} on Thursday a pair of [[**massive
collaborative projects** in]{.underline}]{.mark} the fields of [[food
security and clean energy]{.mark} after they met]{.underline} at a
virtual summit [during]{.underline} US President Joe [Biden's visit to
Jerusalem.]{.underline}

Biden, Prime Minister Yair Lapid, UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed and
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made the announcement in a joint
statement their offices issued during their virtual meeting --- the
highest-level gathering to date of the new, US-formulated I2U2 forum.

In public remarks before the closed-door meeting, [the four [leaders
stressed the importance of working together to address global
challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"We need to think in new terms when it comes to energy, food security,
water tech, defense and trade," Lapid said. "In the 21st century,
challenges are local but solutions are global."

The Israeli premier highlighted the food security crisis in the wake of
Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling the emerging food corridor between
India and the UAE "a clear example of a solution to a problem we are all
facing."

Speaking after Lapid, Biden said the meeting is "about demonstrating the
importance of showing the practical impacts" of Israel's growing
integration.

"Our challenge together is to deliver real results that people can feel
in their everyday lives," he continues. "We can do a great deal if we
stick together," the president concludes, stressing that he intends to
stay engaged on the matter.

"Under the I2U2 framework, we have agreed to increase joint investment
in six important areas: water, energy, transport, space, health and food
security. It is clear that both the vision and agenda of I2U2 are
progressive and practical," Modi said.

"I also hope that our quartet will be a model for those who desire peace
and prosperity," bin Zayed said.

[US [National Security Adviser]{.mark}]{.underline} Jake [[Sullivan told
reporters]{.underline}]{.mark} en route to Israel on Wednesday [that
bringing together Israel, India and the UAE]{.underline}, particularly
to utilize their expertise to address food security challenges,
[fulfills Biden's vision of a "more integrated, more globally engaged
Middle East."]{.underline}

"[We think [I2U2 can become a feature of the broader
region]{.mark}]{.underline}, just as the Quad has become a central
pillar of the Indo-Pacific strategy of the United States," [Sullivan
said]{.underline}, referring to the security dialogue the US has with
India, Australia and Japan.

Thursday's joint statement said the four countries would aim to "harness
the vibrancy of our societies and entrepreneurial spirit to tackle some
of the greatest challenges confronting our world, with a particular
focus on joint investments and new initiatives in water, energy,
transportation, space, health and food security."

The I2U2 countries also will utilize their respective private sectors to
advance low carbon development pathways, improve public health and
access to vaccines, jointly create new solutions for waste treatment,
and promote the development of green technologies, the communique said.

The countries stressed their support for Israel's integration in the
region, drawing a connecting line between the Abraham Accords
normalization agreements and the formation of forums such as the I2U2.
They also welcomed other new regional groupings such as the Negev Forum,
which consists of Israel, the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and the US.

Notably, the joint statement made no mention of the Palestinians. The US
in the past has pressed for the inclusion of a commitment to advance the
two-state solution in such documents, though it might have been
outnumbered by the three other countries whose leaders have expressed
less interest in publicly promoting the issue.

The leaders "discussed innovative ways to ensure longer-term, more
diversified food production and food delivery systems that can better
manage global food shocks," the communique said.

As for the two projects announced Thursday, the first will see the UAE
invest \$2 billion to develop a series of food parks across India that
will incorporate green technologies to reduce food waste, conserve fresh
water and employ renewable energy sources.

The collaboration will see India provide land and integrate its farmers
into the project, and the US and Israel will encourage their respective
private sectors to offer their expertise for the initiative, which will
help address food insecurity in South Asia and the Middle East.

The second initiative will be the creation of a hybrid renewable energy
project in "India's Gujarat State of 300 megawatts (MW) of wind and
solar capacity complemented by a battery energy storage system," the
joint statement said.

The US Trade and Development Agency footed the bill for a \$330 million
feasibility study for the project and Emirati companies are exploring
investment opportunities, with the encouragement of the US and Israeli
governments. The project will help advance India's goal of achieving 500
GW of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and transforming the country into
a global hub for renewable energy.

[The I2U2 [leaders stressed that the]{.mark} two [projects were **only
the beginning** of a "long-term strategic partnership]{.mark} that...
improve the movement of people and goods across hemispheres and increase
sustainability...\[through\] collaborative science and
tech]{.underline}nology [partnerships."]{.underline}

the]{.mark} meet as [West Asia \'Quad\']{.mark}, [despite]{.mark} the
fact that **existing [geopolitical realities]{.mark}** work against such
nomenclature.]{.underline} Here\'s why:

Disagreement over Iran, China and Russia

In the ever-changing global politics where national interests seem to be
the driving factor of foreign policy, [the I2U2]{.underline} comes
across as a collection of unlikely [countries]{.underline} whose
[current foreign policies]{.underline}, if continued, [will create
divisions rather than unify them. Among the many [key foreign policy
issues that divide the group are]{.mark} how to deal with [**Russia**,
**China** and **Iran**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Russia question: Though the US has reiterated that the global food
crisis in the backdrop of the Ukraine conflict is going to be one of the
main topics of the I2U2, the US is likely to find itself isolated in
convincing the other members that Russia is behind the global food
crisis.

Apart from the US, none of the other three countries in the I2U2 ---
Israel, India and the UAE --- have followed the Western steps in
imposing sanctions on Russia. In fact, they have continued to maintain
\"good\" ties with Moscow. India specifically has increased its oil
purchases to tide over the high fuel prices. India has also abstained
from voting on either UN or UNSC resolutions against Russia.

Israel, in the meanwhile, has refused to sell its Iron Dome System to
Ukraine to protect Ukrainian cities and military establishments from
Russian attacks despite US approval.

The UAE, too, has abstained from voting against Russia in the UNSC
resolutions and has even welcomed Russian oligarchs in the country.

The China Question: The US and India, who are members of the Quad
Security Dialogue, a grouping dubbed as an anti-China alliance, are
bringing two important nations of West Asia --- Israel and UAE --- to
form a unique West Asian bloc. However, while the Quad\'s primary
objective is to work for a \"free, open, prosperous and inclusive
Indo-Pacific region,\" the I2U2 focus is limited to economic
collaborations in areas such as water, energy, transportation, space,
health, and food security.

[[The chances of any collaborations in]{.mark} terms of [defence and
security]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would qualify to term the bloc as a
West Asian \'Quad\' [[seem **nil**.]{.underline}]{.mark} The UAE is
already a part of China\'s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) while Israel
has been benefitting from the ban on US tech imports to China. It also
hopes to benefit from the BRI and act as a connecting point between
Europe and Asia. So, neither the UAE nor Israel stands to benefit from
any efforts at containing China\'s influence in the region.

The Iran question: Israel says India will strengthen the impact of the
Abraham Accords, but it has also made it clear that it is against Iran.
The two countries are involved in a proxy war for decades with Iran
supporting the Palestine Movement. The Abraham Accords, on the other
hand, are a worry for Iran as it has reduced the distance between the
Israeli Army and the Iranian border. The accords also allow other West
Asian nations to purchase American weapons they couldn\'t access
earlier.

Iran\'s proxy war against the UAE and Saudi Arabia is also a known fact.
Both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, who are friends with India, regularly
face drone attacks by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.

Despite the complexities of the region, India has managed to maintain
good ties with West Asian countries, especially Iran. New Delhi is
unlikely to break those ties and join an alliance against Tehran. And
for good reasons.

India breaking ties with Iran will benefit China, which has signed a
25-year cooperation deal with Tehran. It would also mean New Delhi
abandoning investments in the Chabahar port and other infrastructure
projects.

The eastern section of the North-South corridor in Iran connecting
Russia to India via Iranian rail has become operational. The first rail
transit carrying 39 containers from Russia reached Iran on Tuesday.
According to a report in Tehran Times, the cargo will be transported to
Bandar Abbas port in southern Iran through a 1,600 km rail route to
finally be sent to India\'s Nhava Sheva Port in Navi Mumbai via sea.

India is one of the largest investors in the Iranian oil and gas
industry as well. As Talmeez Ahmed, India\'s former ambassador to Saudi
Arabia, recently told PTI, \"There is no way India will join an alliance
against Iran.\"

India-Israel Defence Ties: Security Implications for Pakistan

[The defence and military partnership of India and Israel seems to be
enduring because of their mutual strategic interests and continuous
collaboration.]{.underline} Israel is facilitating India to acquire
requisite defence equipment's, defence production capability and
upgraded weapons to maintain their alliance and sustain its ambition to
be a major regional as well as a global power. [Sophistication in
military tech]{.underline}nology [with the help of Israel and the
allocation of high budget for defence purpose indicates that India wants
to counter the joint threat of Pakistan and China. Hence]{.underline},
[[India's]{.mark} regional and global hegemonic approach and growing
defence [coop]{.mark}eration [with Israel is]{.mark} not only
**[destabilizing the regional strategic balance]{.mark}** but also
carries severe consequences for the stability of South Asian
region.]{.underline} Their clandestine relations during the Cold-War era
and strong alliance after the Cold-War period proved to be a potential
threat especially for Pakistan's security. India's obsession with power
projection against strategically compatible Pakistan and strong rival
China tempts it to find a reliable defence partner and Israel comes in
handy.

In the last two decades, India has strengthened its defence partnership
with Israel by pursuing military modernization. Timothy Hoyt writes that
"military modernization is most advanced in states which are deeply
involved in regional political-military rivalries, or which boast
significant military and economic advantage over most of their
neighbors. Many developing states face potential external threats, from
regional neighbors or outside forces. These threats usually create a
demand for advanced military capabilities and an \[end page 156\]
expanded military-industrial base."79 Therefore, to enhance its
operational and deployment capabilities, India is continuously procuring
advanced missile defence system, sophisticated delivery mechanism and
advanced nuclear technology, which is ultimately raising the "level of
threat, insecurity and arms race in the region. Various agreements on
missile and defence cooperation with Israel have definitely enhanced
military superiority of India while disintegrating the balance of power
and compeling Pakistan to allocate extra resources on the defence
sector.80 Also, the development in air, naval, satellite and space
program has provided India with a strategic gain over Pakistan.

Moreover, the surveillance equipment (i.e., UAVs, cross-border sensors,
and Airborne Early Warning" Systems), which India is getting from
Israel,81 would help India in carrying out swift and quick operations or
strikes against Pakistan and to infiltrate Pakistan's territory.
February 2019 Balakot crisis between India and Pakistan is a recent
example that determines the pace of India-Israel defence partnership in
which India used Israeli weapons to launch strikes inside Pakistan's
territory.82 Such incident only increases the chances of war between
both the states albeit limited, intensify threat matrix for Pakistan and
destabilize the peace and stability in the region." Robert Fisk clearly
stated that the defence ties between India and Israel have strengthened
in the past few years which include sophisticated training \[end page
157\] and arms trade. According to him, "Israel has been assiduously
lining itself up alongside India's national BJP government\...while
India itself has now become the largest weapons market for the Israeli
arms trade."83 Hence, [[India-Israel]{.mark} strategic and defence
partnership [is an **existential threat to**]{.mark} **the national
security of [Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline} and affecting regional
security calculus as well.

For India, who is dreaming to become an "Asian giant," Israeli military
technology and security cooperation provides it with the finest way to
cope with its security issues. Governed by geostrategic and geopolitical
priorities, the strategic partnership with Israel is enabling India to
attain its greatest policy objectives, i.e. to gain regional hegemony.
It is being ensured by strengthening its defence sector, to expand its
military power beyond its region. The goals are wide-ranging and also
include geo-economic objective, blocking Pakistan's access to and
undermine its influence in the Middle East and Central Asian states. It
seeks to ultimately destabilize and weaken Pakistan's defensive balance
capability both at the eastern and western front and counter China's
influence in the region. India aspires to annex the illegally occupied
Kashmiri territory following Israel's annexation policy. In short,
[India-Israel strategic alliance]{.underline}, indeed, [is emerging as
the **major threat to strategic stability** "in South Asia and carries
far-reaching implications for Pakistan's security."]{.underline}

Analyzing the aspects of [[India-Israel]{.underline}]{.mark} growing
proximity and defence ties, it is noted that the strategic equilibrium
in the region is shifting in the favor of India. The progression in
their [relationship not only undermines the military balance of South
Asia but also **[destabilizes the conventional balance]{.mark}**
vis-à-vis Pakistan.]{.underline} Harsh V. Pant stated that "the \[end
page 158\] most immediate effects of this close defence relationship
between India and Israel can be seen in Pakistan's worry that the
strategic balance in the subcontinent is fast tilting against it. It
finds it difficult to match the conventional military capability of
Israel-India combined."84 Hence, the conventional and unconventional
military superiority of India is helping it to establish hegemony in the
region and destabilize Pakistan's security. Moreover, India and Israel
are constantly solidifying their military ties because it is not only
India who is apprehensive about the nuclear arsenals of Pakistan, but
Israel had also serious concerns about Pakistan's nuclear weapons
program.85 This specifies that [[India-Israel]{.mark}
defence]{.underline} and missile [cooperation [is not only activating an
**arms race**]{.mark} in South Asia [but]{.mark} also **[destabilizing
the deterrence equation]{.mark}** besides affecting the strategic
stability in the region.]{.underline}

Conclusion

[An [expansion]{.mark} of defence cooperation between India and Israel
along with the acquisition of military and nuclear capabilities by India
through its strategic partnership with Israel [would]{.mark} not only
undermine the regional balance but will also [have severe
consequences]{.mark} "[for]{.mark} the [stability]{.mark} of South Asia
in future.]{.underline} This cooperation reveals India's strong
commitment to dominance and "power projection in the broader Southern
Asian region that includes Indian Ocean and Malacca Straits. Moreover,
India considers Pakistan and China a major irritant in its quest for
hegemony. Therefore, the defence partnership with Israel is seen as the
guarantee to ensuring its ambitions.

All the major arms deal with Israel including the transfer of technology
and production of missiles are "part of Prime Minister Modi's Make in
India initiative." The steady progress and cooperation \[end page 159\]
in missile defence system with Israel under this initiative is
generating a regional security dilemma by endangering the security of
other states. Development and" acquisition of defence system, as well as
missile proliferation, is rigorously undermining the strategic stability
and has the potential to accelerate arms race in the region. In this
process India seems to have ignored that its [[actions are **worsening
the security dilemma**]{.mark}, increasing insecurity, [**intensifying
arms race** and provoking Pakistan to take
**countermeasures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which]{.mark} in turn [will
further deteriorate the security environment]{.mark} of South Asian
region.]{.underline}

Key Point: [If peace ever collapsed, [an Indian-Pakistani
conflict]{.mark} might not stay regional. Fall out from any nuclear
weapons use [would **devastate the entire world**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

While the United States is preoccupied by the threat of nuclear weapons
in the hands of potential adversaries such as Russia, China or North
Korea, [[the danger of nuclear conflict may]{.underline}]{.mark}
actually [[be greatest]{.mark} between]{.underline} two of its allies,
[Pakistan and India. The two nations have engaged in **four
wars**]{.underline} starting since their partition along religious lines
[in 1947. A fifth could be drastically more costly]{.underline}, [as
their nuclear capabilities continue to grow and diversify.]{.underline}

Several years ago I made the acquaintance of a Pakistani nuclear science
student in China. Curious about the thinking behind his country's
nuclear program, I asked if he really believed there was a possibility
that India would invade Pakistan. "There's still a lot of old-school
thinkers in the Congress Party that believe India and Pakistan should be
united," he told me.

[I doubt]{.underline} there are [many observers outside of
[Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline} who [believe India is plotting to invade
and occupy]{.underline} the Muslim state, [but a [feeling of existential
enmity persists.]{.mark}]{.underline} The third conflict between the two
countries in 1971 established India's superiority in conventional
warfare---not unexpectedly, as India has several times Pakistan's
population.

The bone of contention has always been the Indian state of Jammu and
Kashmir. At the time of partition, the predominantly Muslim state was
politically divided over which nation to join. When Pakistani-allied
tribesmen attempted to force the issue, the Hindu maharaja of the region
chose to accede to India, leading to the first war between India and
Pakistan. Ever since, the line of control between the Indian and
Pakistan side has remained bitterly contested, with artillery and sniper
fire routinely exchanged. Pakistan intelligence services have
infiltrated insurgents and plotted attacks across the border for
decades, and Indian security troops have been implicated in human-rights
violations and killings of the locals as a result of their
counterinsurgency operations.

[Pakistan does have to fear the potential of an Indian counterstrike
intended to retaliate for a terrorist attack]{.underline} by
Pakistani-aligned groups, such as the killing of 166 in Mumbai by
Lashkar-e-Taiba in 2008 or the attack on Indian parliament in 2001 by
Jaish-e-Muhammad. In both cases, the attackers had ties with Pakistani
Inter-Services Intelligence, and Islamabad has shown limited willingness
or ability to crack down on these groups. [Complicating matters,
[civilian control of the military is far from consolidated]{.mark} in
Pakistan]{.underline}, [and it would be quite possible for ISI or some
other agency to carry out such activities on its own initiative without
the knowledge or support of the head of state.]{.underline}

[[India's military has]{.mark} formulated [a "Cold Start"
doctrine]{.mark} to enable its forward-deployed land forces to launch an
armored assault into Pakistani territory on short notice in response to
a perceived provocation from Islamabad.]{.underline} This new strategy
was devised after the Indian Army's armored strike corps took three
weeks to deploy to the border after the attack on the Indian parliament
in 2001, by which time Pakistan had already mobilized its own troops.

[[Islamabad sees nuclear weapons as its deterrent]{.mark} against a
conventional attack]{.underline}, [and Cold Start]{.underline} in
particular. This is demonstrated by its refusal to adhere to a "No First
Use" policy. [Pakistan]{.underline} has an extensive plutonium
production capacity, and [is estimated to possess 130 to 140
warheads]{.underline}, a total that may easily increase to 220 to 250 in
a decade, according to a report by the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists.

Many of the new weapons are smaller, short-range tactical weapons
intended for targeting frontline troops. [To enable a second-strike
capability, Pakistan has also empowered local commanders to launch
retaliatory nuclear strikes in case the chain of command is
disrupted.]{.underline}

While battlefield nuclear weapons are less likely to cause the mass
civilian casualties that a strike against a densely populated city would
produce, they are deeply worrying in their own way: a state may be more
tempted to employ tactical nuclear weapons, and perceive doing so as
being intrinsically less risky. However, [many [simulations]{.mark} of
nuclear war [suggest]{.mark} that [tactical]{.mark}-nuclear-weapon
[usage **rapidly escalates**]{.mark} to strategic weapons.]{.underline}

Furthermore, tactical nuclear weapons are necessarily more dispersed,
and thus less secure than those stationed in permanent facilities. These
issues led the U.S. Army to at first reorganize its tactical nuclear
forces in the 1960s, and largely abandon them after the end of the Cold
War.

Pakistan fields nearly a dozen different types of missiles to facilitate
this strategy, developed with Chinese and North Korean assistance.
Ground based tactical systems include the Hatf I, an unguided
ground-based rocket with a range of one hundred kilometers, and the Nasr
Hatf IX, which can be mounted on mobile quad-launchers. Longer reach is
provided by Ghauri II and Shaheen II medium-range ballistic missiles,
which can strike targets up to around 1,600 and 2,500 kilometers,
respectively.

The Pakistani Air Force's American-made F-16 fighters are also believed
to have been modified to deploy nuclear weapons. The older F-16As and Bs
of the Thirty-Eighth Fighter Wing and the newer Cs and Ds of the
Thirty-Ninth are both believed to be based near nuclear-weapon storage
facilities. The PAF's five squadrons of Mirage IIIs, based in Karachi
and Shorkot, meanwhile, have been modified to launch the
domestically-produced Ra'ad nuclear Air-Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM),
with a range of 350 kilometers. New JF-17 fighters jointly produced with
China are also thought to be capable of carrying the Ra'ad ALCM.

The Pakistani Navy lacks a nuclear strike capability, but appears
interested in acquiring one. In January of this year, it released a
video claiming to show a test launch of a Babur-3 submarine-launched
cruise missile. The domestically produced Babur is similar to the
Tomahawk, and designed to approach its target at low altitude to avoid
detection. Pakistan already possesses land-based TEL vehicles to deploy
the nuclear-capable weapon.

Reflecting its superior conventional abilities, India does adhere to a
"No First Use" nuclear weapons policy. Its security posture is also
complicated by long lasting tensions with China, dating back to a border
war in 1962 in which Beijing seized territory in the Himalayas. Today,
China is closely allied economically and militarily with Pakistan, and
even has a naval base in Gwadar as part of a strategy to envelop India.
India, by contrast, continues to receive much of its weaponry from
Russia, but does not enjoy the same kind of military alliance. It has
instead dramatically expanded civilian nuclear cooperation with the
United States and other nations in the last decades.

India possesses a smaller number of nuclear weapons, estimated in 2015
to range between ninety and 120. However, New Delhi recently acquired a
full nuclear triad of air-, land- and sea-based nuclear platforms when
it deployed its first home-produced nuclear-powered submarine, the INS
Arihant. The Arihant is capable of launching a dozen K-15 Sagarika
submarine-launched ballistic missiles. However, these are limited to a
range of 750 kilometers, and are thus incapable of reaching the major
inland cities of Pakistan or China, a shortcoming India is attempting to
address with new K-4 missiles, derived form the land-based Agni-III. New
Delhi intends to produce three more nuclear submarines over the years,
while Pakistan is considering building one of their own.

India's chief nuclear arm is thought to lay in its Mirage 2000H and
Jaguar fighter-bombers, which can carry nuclear gravity bombs. In 2016,
India signed a contract for thirty-six nuclear-capable fourth-generation
Rafale fighters from France, further enhancing its aerial striking
power. India has also modified its Su-30 fighter-bombers to carry the
BrahMos cruise missiles with a range of five hundred kilometers. These
could theoretically carry nuclear warheads, though none are believed to
have been so equipped so far.

India also has its own array of ground-based nuclear ballistic missiles.
The most numerous are slow-firing Prithvi short-range ballistic
missiles. Twenty mobile Agni-1 ballistic missiles with a range of seven
hundred kilometers are also deployed along the border with Pakistan,
while ten heavier Agni-II systems with a range of two thousand
kilometers are situated in the northwest for potential strikes on China.
India also possesses a small number of rapid-deploying Agni III missiles
with a range of 3,500 kilometers, and is developing an Agni IV MRBM and
Agni VI ICBM with sufficient range to hit Chinese cities on the Pacific
coast.

If there is any silver lining to this steady escalation in nuclear
firepower, it's that neither India nor Pakistan appears to possess
chemical or biological weapons. (India completed the destruction of its
stock of mustard gas in 2009.) However, the potential for catastrophic
loss of human life if nuclear warheads rain down on the cities of the
Indian subcontinent is self-evident.

Indian prime minister Narendra Modi and Pakistani prime minister Nawaz
Sharif showed goodwill in a surprise meeting in 2015. Unfortunately,
neither state appears capable of shaking out of its intractable pattern
of conflict, driven by domestic political forces, which makes diplomatic
accommodation difficult. The struggle for Kashmir occupies an important
part of Pakistani national identity, and there has yet to be a civilian
head of state in Islamabad with the will and authority to bring an end
to cross-border infiltration and support for terrorist or insurgent
fighters. For its part, the Indian Army has failed to respect local
Kashmiri leaders and significantly improve its human-rights record.

In 2016 the killing of Kashmiri militant Burhan Wani led to an outbreak
of domestic civil unrest in Kashmir that resulted in dozens of civilian
deaths. After attackers killed seventeen Indian Army troops in Uri on
September 18, the Indian army launched a cross-border raid under murky
circumstances ten days later, followed by heavy exchanges of artillery
and sniper fire in October and November that killed or injured dozens of
civilians and soldiers on both sides of the Line of Control.

The United States sits awkwardly astride the two states. During the Cold
War, the United States tilted in favor of Pakistan due to India's good
relations with the Soviet Union. Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger,
against the advice of the State Department, even dispatched a carrier
task force in a futile attempt to dissuade India from its support of
Bengali independence fighters. However, in recent decades, U.S.
diplomacy has moved gradually in favor of democratic India, both due to
its potential as a future superpower and its role as a counterbalance to
Chinese influence. The role played by President Clinton in helping
negotiate the end of the Kargil conflict in 1999 stood as a key turning
point in the region---and marked one of the most dangerous
confrontations in recent history, as it two nuclear-armed states were at
risk of entering into full-scale conflict.

U.S. relations with Pakistan, meanwhile, have worsened despite a
continuing flow of American arms for the Pakistani military. This mutual
distrust is due to the presence of Islamic militant groups on Pakistani
soil and U.S. drone strikes targeting them. Washington and Islamabad
have genuinely diverging interests in regards to Afghanistan, the latter
desiring to control Afghanistan out of fear that it might otherwise fall
under Indian influence. Pakistan, however, can fall back on its
relations with China if the U.S. alliance collapses, leading to a
complicated diplomatic balancing act.

Despite diverging political agendas on the Indian subcontinent, there
should be a common interest in limiting the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and the likelihood of nuclear war. [[Growing arsenals]{.mark} in
India and Pakistan serve to **[increase the catastrophic human
cost]{.mark}** of a potential conflict between the too]{.underline},
[[without]{.mark} evidently [decreasing]{.mark} the [frequency of
inflammatory]{.mark} episodes of [violence]{.mark} that spike tensions
between the nuclear-armed states.]{.underline}

[[India and Pakistan]{.mark} will]{.underline} of course
[[retain]{.mark} their [nuclear arms]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
continue to [see them as **vital deterrents**]{.mark} to
attack.]{.underline} However, [for such policies [to **remain tenable in
the long run**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} longtime [adversaries
must]{.mark} seek to **[bring an end to a pattern of recurring
conflict]{.mark}** that is entering its seventh decade this
year.]{.underline}

### 2AC --- Plan Solves Israel-NATO Cooperation

to NATO," *Al-Monitor*, June 30^th^, Available Online at

Accessed 07-18-2022)

[Jerusalem is closely following the]{.underline} annual [NATO
summit]{.underline} convening this week in Madrid. The dramatic news of
an agreement with Turkey for Sweden and Finland to join the alliance has
far-reaching implications for the Middle East, Israel and beyond.
[[The]{.mark} new [Strat]{.mark}egic [Con]{.mark}cept]{.underline}
endorsed yesterday by NATO leaders [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[likely to]{.mark} affect its relations with its major non-member
partners such as Israel.]{.underline}

Diplomats in Jerusalem and Brussels told Al-Monitor this week that while
these geopolitical developments are expected to alter Israel-NATO
relations, [the changes could]{.underline} actually [benefit Israel and
[**make the partnership grow**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Israel realizes that the Russian invasion of Ukraine has undermined the
security order in Europe and that the European Union is facing a new era
of strategic conflict on the continent. Thus, Europe and NATO are now
looking east.

The Russian invasion took place on the backdrop of reforms NATO has been
undergoing for the past three years, ever since French President
Emmanuel Macron warned that the alliance suffering from \"brain death.\"
The Biden administration\'s commitment to resume its leading role in
NATO promises to bring about a healthy process of reforms.

In February 2021, the [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Secretariat [released
a proposed [road map]{.mark} for a series of reforms. They
[included]{.mark} addressing [emerging
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [threats such as cyber and
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence[, preparing the
civilian home front for unconventional weapons and confronting the
spread of global terrorism.]{.underline}

[[An]{.mark}other important [insight was]{.mark} the understanding
[that]{.mark} dealing with [innovation]{.mark} in the fields of
security, production of new strategic tools and confronting
tech]{.underline}nological [challenges all [require deeper
coop]{.mark}eration [with the private sector]{.mark}. That means not
only collaboration with military industries but also building a dialogue
with the software giants and social networks as well as with companies
that produce dual-use]{.underline} (civil/military)
[tech]{.underline}nologies[, all areas of extensive Israeli
experience.]{.underline}

[For Israel, the developments NATO has been and is undergoing are
important for two reasons.]{.underline}

[The first is the growing recognition in Jerusalem over the importance
of strengthening relations with the alliance. [Israeli
innovation]{.mark}, its capabilities in the fields of cyber,
intelligence, civilian/military interfaces, and the Israeli envelope
allowing high-tech to flourish]{.underline}, [[greatly interest
NATO.]{.underline}]{.mark} At the same time, [[Jerusalem is interested
in cooperating]{.mark} with the alliance]{.underline}, [which could
benefit both its defense systems and the private sector.]{.underline}
Israeli companies present at the May Eurosatory 2022 security fair in
Paris told Al-Monitor that NATO countries\' officials showed great
interest in Israeli technologies.

[The second is that beyond military and tech]{.underline}nology
[cooperation, NATO also serves as a significant diplomatic platform. The
alliance offers an arena through which Israel could strengthen its ties
with democracies and with Mediterranean countries]{.underline},
[including Turkey.]{.underline}

[[Israel has enjoyed a special relationship with NATO]{.mark} for over
three decades and was the third country to gain non-NATO alliance
status]{.underline} as early as 1989. Following the Oslo Accords, the
organization created the Mediterranean Dialogue Forum to serve as a
framework for regional cooperation for peace and to complement other
international efforts, such as the Barcelona Process of the European
Union and or the Mediterranean Initiative of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. Along with Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt,
Jordan and Morocco, Israel was invited to attend the first meeting of
the 1995 Mediterranean Dialogue Forum.

In the following two decades, Israel\'s relations with NATO focused
mainly on the Mediterranean Dialogue. But in the last few years, in
parallel with the profound changes within the NATO alliance, Jerusalem
has also begun to change direction.

Israel will not abandon the Mediterranean Dialogue, which offers it
opportunities for direct encounters with countries with which it does
not necessarily have political ties. However, [Jerusalem now believes
that Israel\'s value to the alliance (and vice versa) does not lie
exclusively on its geographical merits. This period of [changes]{.mark}
could]{.underline} actually [[present an opportunity for Israel to
**integrate into the alliance**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([[from the
outside]{.underline}]{.mark}, of course) [in a different
way.]{.underline} Thus, [Israel\'s geographical importance to NATO has
diminished, but [Israel\'s]{.mark} ability to contribute to NATO in
terms of intelligence and [tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology
[[turns]{.mark} the country [from a **consumer**]{.mark} of security [to
a]{.mark} potential [security **provider**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Still, [with NATO changing, Israel would also need to
change.]{.underline} Official [Israel]{.underline}, especially the
defense establishment, [knows how to work well with Israeli defense
companies and is accustomed to working with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as well as with Germany and the
U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom[. Trilateral and multilateral
cooperation and structured work with external parties such as NATO are
**not Israeli systems\' strong suit**.]{.underline}

**[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, it is important to note that [Israel has
recognized the strategic change that NATO has undergone from the outset
and the potential it holds for Israel diplomatically,
practically]{.underline} (the defense industries) [and strategically in
a very broad sense.]{.underline}

The changes in Israel-NATO relations are not only linked to large
geopolitical developments and to NATO reforms, but are also highly
affected by Israel's warming ties with Turkey. The deterioration of
bilateral relations between Israel and Turkey, especially since the Mavi
Marmara flotilla incident in 2010, was also reflected in NATO, with
Turkey vetoing Israel\'s continued participation in military activities
of the alliance. Only after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\'s 2016
apology was Israel invited to participate in the multilateral military
exercise \"Black Mountain.\"

The following year, Turkey agreed that Israel would open an office at
NATO headquarters. Israeli diplomats testify that NATO headquarters have
become in recent years a significant arena for the transmission of
messages between the two capitals.

In his paper for the Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies
MITVIM, analyst Roee Kibrik highlights the regional implications and
opportunities that warming up relations with Turkey now offers Israel.

[[The strategic benefit for Israel lies]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[in
**expanding the circle of
intel**]{.mark}**ligence-[sharing]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} For
example, the issue of Iranian terrorism and its emissaries is of great
interest to several NATO members. In general, Israel shares intelligence
with the Americans and there is also institutionalized cooperation with
some major European countries, but Israel shares more limited
intelligence with the other NATO members on a regular basis. Expanding
the circle means the inclusion of Israeli assessments in the
organization\'s publications, papers that eventually find themselves in
the defense ministries of all member states. It\'s a great way for
Israel to highlight strategic issues that are important to it.

In this context, [Israel's Ambassador to the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion [and NATO]{.underline} Haim [Regev told
Al-Monitor]{.underline}, [\"For Israel, the NATO alliance
is]{.underline} a diplomatic arena for receiving and transmitting
messages, but also [an important platform to help build the defense
establishment\'s capabilities and reveal diverse Israeli capabilities.
The challenges facing NATO and Europe in the wake of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine increase the perception of Israel as a significant
asset to the alliance and its member states against the background of
accumulated knowledge and experience.\"]{.underline}

Regev added, \"[[Israel\'s relations with NATO **keep growing and
deepening**]{.mark} in recent years.]{.underline} These relations are
based first and foremost on the common democratic values ​​that the
alliance represents. Israel is greatly recognized and appreciated for
its democratic values and for the experience and knowledge it is willing
to share.\"

[Jerusalem estimates that NATO is at **the beginning of a process** in
which the structure of the geographical partnerships transforms into a
system based largely on shared values ​​and capabilities]{.underline}.
Concerning technologies and security methodologies, say diplomats in
Jerusalem, Israel is probably closer to other NATO non-member partners
such as Austria, Australia and New Zealand than to North Africa.

U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, or
[DEVCOM]{.underline}, reaches across international borders to ensure
Soldiers have the best technology available by leveraging ITCs
strategically located around the world. The [ITCs seek opportunities to
partner with foreign companies on tech]{.underline}nologies [that
support the Army's key priorities.]{.underline}

"My main goal is to establish DEVCOM, AFC and the U.S. as the research
and development partner of choice for the highly innovative technology
companies located in this region. We are committed to ensuring U.S.
warfighters have access to the world's best technologies," said Col.
Mike Fleming, ITC-Mediterranean director.

[DEVCOM ITCs are located in Europe, Asia, South America, and North
America.]{.underline} The ITCs, which are managed by DEVCOM's three
Forward Elements -- DEVCOM Americas, DEVCOM Atlantic and DEVCOM
Indo-Pacific -- are part of the DEVCOM Global Enterprise. The
ITC-Mediterranean's area of responsibility includes Israel, Turkey,
South Africa, and United Arab Emirates.

["One of our biggest challenges was establishing relationships with the
Israeli M]{.underline}inistry [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense[,

The ITCs work closely with DEVCOM and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of
the Army for Defense Exports and Cooperation on the Army's Engineer and
Scientist Exchange Program, or ESEP, which pairs DOD civilian scientists
and engineers with embedded positions in partner nations. The yearlong
assignment creates opportunities to work collaboratively using
laboratories, personnel, facilities, equipment, and other partner
technology resources that support the Army's modernization priorities.

"While we continuously look for new ways to partner with industry, we
also identify research grant and cooperative agreement opportunities
with international scientists and across the Army research enterprise.
These partnerships form the basis of the Basic & Applied Research
mission," said James Mullis, ITC-Mediterranean technical director.

[In addition to scouting for foreign tech]{.underline}nology, [the
[ITC's facilitate]{.mark} the international armaments

[Traditionally]{.underline}, [India has been stone-cold in its responses
to the offers of engagement from]{.underline} the world's most powerful
military alliance -- the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
([NATO]{.underline})[. India's reluctance is rooted in its traditional
policy of non-alignment and its enduring strategic partnership
with]{.underline} the Soviet Union and later [Russia.]{.underline}

[India's stand-off attitude]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [faces
[a new context]{.mark} that at once [limits]{.mark} the possibility for
New Delhi's engagement with the alliance [and generates new imperatives
to engage NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The negative side of the ledger is the deepening conflict between
Russia and NATO after Moscow's aggression against Ukraine. As New Delhi
carefully navigates the complex dynamics between Russia and NATO, India
is unlikely to make a radical departure in its thinking. India's earlier
signals of a softening attitude towards NATO might be harder to pursue
amidst the war in Europe today.]{.underline}

[[New Delhi had]{.underline}]{.mark}, in fact, [[invited]{.mark} NATO's
Secretary-General]{.underline} Jens [[Stoltenberg]{.mark} to speak at
the Indian Foreign Office's premier international forum]{.underline} --
the Raisina Dialogue -- [in]{.underline} April [2021. This was the first
time the NATO leadership had participated in an official Indian
forum.]{.underline}

During his address, [Stoltenberg affirmed that "India was at the
forefront" of many shared security challenges]{.underline}, including
"Afghanistan, international terrorism, to maritime security". [[He
insisted that there was more that India and NATO "can do
together"]{.mark}, including "consult, coordinate and take concerted
action".]{.underline}

[Meanwhile]{.underline}, [the [ideological]{.mark} questions about
[non-alignment are]{.mark} becoming [less meaningful]{.mark} in the
prospects for engagement between India and NATO. India today is closer
than ever before to the Western world. New Delhi has a strong strategic
partnership with key Western countries, including the]{.underline}
United States ([US]{.underline}) [and France. India has also stepped up
security dialogue with the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion[.]{.underline}

[India has also shed some of its opposition to plurilateral arrangements
with the West. It is now an active member of the]{.underline}
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (also called the [Quad]{.underline})
that brings India together with Australia, Japan and the US. [However,
India has carefully avoided branding the Quad as a military
alliance]{.underline}, [as some of its activities have a significant
strategic and security orientation.]{.underline} India also conducts the
ever more sophisticated annual Malabar naval exercises with the US and
its Asian allies -- Australia and Japan.

Meanwhile, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has pushed two neutral states of
Europe -- Sweden and Finland -- into seeking NATO membership. In the
early decades of the Cold War, Sweden was an important partner of India
in developing collaboration between neutral and non-aligned states. No
ideology can be immune from changing circumstances. India's ideology of
non-alignment and opposition to military blocs has been steadily
modified in its post-Cold War international relations.

India actively participates in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation
(SCO), led by Russia and China, which has many military dimensions.
India is an active member of the SCO, which is designed to limit US
influence in inner Asia, but it is reluctant to engage NATO, underlining
the real but unstated pro-Russian bias in Indian security policy. It has
little to do with the ideology of non-alignment but everything to do
with the special relationship that New Delhi has built with Moscow over
the last few decades.

However, [[India's Russian partnership is increasingly
constrained]{.mark} by Moscow's growing tensions with the West as well
as its deepening strategic partnership with China. This coincides with
the steady deterioration of India's ties with China and the sharpening
conflict between Washington and Beijing.]{.underline}

[As balancing China becomes the dominant imperative for India, it has
embraced the idea of the Indo-Pacific, helped revive the Quad, and
welcomed the growing interest of the European powers, including France,
the U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom [and the EU]{.underline},
[in the region.]{.underline}

[[Although India has not formally welcomed NATO's]{.mark} growing
[outreach]{.mark} to the Indo-Pacific in recent years, [it has
no]{.mark} ostensible [reason to quarrel with it]{.mark} either. Any
additional pressure on China from Europe and NATO cannot but serve
India's interest in balancing Beijing.]{.underline} After all, in the
last few years, India has often tried to persuade Russia to tone down
its hostility toward the Indo-Pacific, if with little success.

[What we have seen is a tightening embrace of Russia and China that
complicates India's regional calculus.]{.underline} Moscow and Beijing
have drawn closer, especially after they unveiled a partnership "without
limits" and no "forbidden areas" just days before Moscow's invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022.

[This]{.underline}, in turn, [has intensified a drift towards the
integration of the Asian and European theatres]{.underline}, which were
long seen as separate. [The circle was closed at NATO's Madrid
summit]{.underline} in June 2022, [which saw the first ever
participation of the prime ministers of Australia, Japan and New Zealand
and the president of South Korea.]{.underline}

[As the new interactive dynamic between the Sino-Russian strategic
partnership and NATO's Asian engagement unfolds, [India cannot forever
take a segmented approach to Europe]{.mark} (and Russia) on the one hand
[and the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} (China) on the other. As New Delhi
recalibrates its strategy, [**engagement with NATO must inevitably
figure in India's geopolitical agenda**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Beyond the question of India adjusting to the shifting geopolitical
terrain, [there are significant immediate benefits for New Delhi in any
bilateral engagement with NATO.]{.underline} As a former senior US
official, A Wess Mitchell, put it, [India can gain substantially from a
partnership with NATO]{.underline}, [including military, strategic and
tech]{.underline}nological, [without in any way constraining its broader
strategic options.]{.underline}

Sceptics will keep their fingers crossed. However, optimists will point
out that [India has made many unprecedented changes to its international
relations in recent years -- if quietly and in an incremental manner.
[It will be **no surprise** then if India's attitude to NATO will
continue to evolve]{.mark} in the coming years.]{.underline}

[[Silicon Valley's frustration]{.mark} with the D]{.underline}epartment
[o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} both
well-known and [[well-founded.]{.mark} All too often]{.underline}, [the
department provides initial funding to develop a promising
tech]{.underline}nology, [only to fail to deliver funding adequate to
sustain a scaled capability. This gap between initial and sustained
funding is so well-known that it has nickname---the]{.underline}
so-called ["valley of death"---and it makes the Pentagon an unreliable
partner.]{.underline} It has gotten bad enough that when defense and
technology officials recently convened for the annual Reagan National
Defense Forum in California, investors and technologists made clear that
their collective tolerance for the Pentagon's inability to work
effectively with the defense innovation base is nearing the point of no
return.

[The [Defense]{.mark} Department is aware of this criticism and [has
sought to address it via]{.mark} meaningful
[reform.]{.mark}]{.underline} In a report from earlier this month on
competition in the defense industrial base, the DoD reports that these
efforts have achieved creditable success in increasing engagement with
small businesses through the use of tools like the "Other Transaction
Authority," the "Small Business Innovation Research," and the "Small
Business Technology Transfer" programs. The 2022 National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA) includes similar reform provisions instructing
the DoD to streamline contracting---especially of systems that enable
software development and adoption---and to expand engagement with new
and underused vendors. It also includes an important provision
establishing a committee to review and to make recommendations about how
to best revise the Planning, Programming, Budgeting & Execution Process
(PPBE), the means through which the Pentagon allocates its resources.

[[These]{.mark} measures are sensible but [should **not** be expected to
solve]{.mark} the DoD's difficulties acquiring the
tech]{.underline}nology [it needs to build a modernized military.
**[Process change]{.mark}** can reduce barriers to
acquisition]{.underline}, [but it [will **not** remove the **central
impediment**: The problem **isn't** that the DoD doesn't know **how** to
buy; it is that **it doesn't know what to buy**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Function-first acquisition

[The DoD's approach to tech]{.underline}nology [has its origins in the
Cold War.]{.underline} In the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower faced
the difficult problem of how to counter the Soviet Union's much larger
conventional forces without devoting the entirety of the federal budget
to defense spending. The solution was the concept of "offset," the idea
that the United States could find a way to compensate for its
disadvantage in the relative balance of forces in Europe. Eisenhower's
approach to offset, the "New Look" strategy, relied upon surpassing the
Soviets in the emergent technologies of the day---nuclear weapons and
the airplanes and missiles to deliver them. This would balance out the
Soviet Union's conventional advantage, and at manageable expense to the
U.S. taxpayer.

This first offset strategy lasted only as long as it took the Soviet
Union to achieve nuclear parity, and by the early 1970s the United
States once again needed a means of compensating for the Soviet
advantage in conventional assets. The second attempt at offset focused
not on increasing the kinetic power of individual munitions nor on
amassing the platforms to deliver them, but on ensuring that targets
could be reliably hit. The result was a revolution in precision warfare,
generated by investments in guided munitions and in the radar,
positioning, and communications networks upon which they rely.

In the 1990s, the second offset and the collapse of the Soviet Union
left the United States with a large arsenal more capable than ever
before of locating and destroying adversary hardware at distance and an
environment in which there was little pressure to evolve operational
concepts. If anything, the 1991 Gulf War and the air war in Kosovo
seemed to affirm existing concepts, and the long, consuming
counterinsurgency campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq in the 2000s
demanded use of current capabilities more than the development of new
ones. The Department of Defense thus was under little pressure to think
about technology as anything other than the constituent parts of large
platforms and systems designed to deliver kinetic force---a paradigm
that led to the procurement of the functionally dubious F-35 Lighting II
Joint Strike Fighter program in 2001 and the similarly troubled Gerald
R. Ford class of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers in 2008.

By 2014, however, a group of senior defense officials convinced that
growth in China's military capabilities was putting U.S. interests in
the Indo-Pacific at risk revived the idea of offset. This time, the idea
was that the United States could offset China's geographic advantage by
using modern technologies to enable the U.S. military to "project power
and to dominate force-on-force encounters." The thinking behind the
third offset influenced the 2018 National Defense Strategy and energized
the Pentagon's interest in modernization. It did not, however, break the
habit of defining modernization in terms of large, technology-laden
platforms capable of carrying out precision strikes from distance. This
fixation persists despite compelling analysis that now should temper
claims about the success of this type of high-tech warfare in Kosovo and
Iraq (both times).

Initial victories in these conflicts tempted many analysts to conclude
that technological prowess had given the United States a decisive
advantage. After-action assessments deflate these conclusions. In
Kosovo, the success of the air campaign was measured primarily in terms
of U.S. and NATO losses---outcomes determined more by rules of
engagement than by the technology used. In Iraq, assessing the impact of
precision-guided munitions at the outset of both invasions is
complicated by the fact that they often were used in conjunction with
less sophisticated, unguided ordnance. Nonetheless, enough data are
available for serious analysts of both wars to highlight the importance
of so-called "legacy" assets in completing critical tasks and to stress
that the capabilities of the adversary, the terrain, and even the
weather were particularly conducive to U.S. operations.

None of these conditions would be met in a conflict with China. China's
electromagnetic, air, cyber, and missile capabilities are formidable;
its surrounding seas and coastal terrain are not static, flat, and
featureless; and the PLA is well-trained and committed. These
characteristics reduce the value of large, centralizing platforms---like
aircraft carriers and the planned Joint all Domain Command and Control
(JADC2) system---and increase the return on investment in technologies
that promote flexibility, support mobility, and enable localized
decisionmaking.

The Marine Corps offers an example of what this kind of technology
pragmatism looks like. The Commandant's Planning Guidance from 2019, the
Force Design 2030 from 2020, and A Concept for Stand-in Forces from last
year together offer a cohesive, if still developing, description of what
the Marine Corps must be able to achieve in the near term and of how to
do so. Clarity about the functions the Marine Corps must fulfill begets
clarity about the role of technology, and so it is pursuing mobile,
expendable tools that enable small and dispersed elements to conduct
reconnaissance and to make timely, informed choices about maneuver and
engagement. These capabilities will be useful in a high-end warfight,
should that be necessary, and also in the conduct of daily
competition---used to detect unwanted adversarial behaviors short of war
and to mobilize to deter or rebuff them quickly. When faced with the
option of continuing to chase future funding for a next-generation
multifunctional drone system or to purchase the proven MQ-9 Reaper this
year, the Marines chose the latter, a decision that prioritized function
over form. The 2022 NDAA-mandated commission to review the PPB&E process
might take note of this as a demonstration of how coherent strategy
makes it possible to reconcile the tension between short-term budgeting
and long-term force planning.

Informed buyer

Technology firms often credit individual leadership with acquisition
successes. [[When]{.mark} there is [a buyer]{.mark} who [understands how
a tool will be useful]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} DoD [process
is]{.mark} a hurdle]{.underline}, [but **[not an
obstacle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [on the way to getting a deal done.
This does not require expertise in tech]{.underline}nology[. Knowing how
a tech]{.underline}nology [works is not prerequisite to understanding
how it can be used. Knowing what needs to be done]{.underline}, however,
[**is** prerequisite to understanding whether a tech]{.underline}nology
[will be useful.]{.underline}

[Today's tech]{.underline}nology [companies are especially good at
designing tools to fulfill clearly articulated functional needs. The
areas in which the greatest advances are being made are in capturing
data and in using sophisticated processing
techniques]{.underline}---like machine learning---[to enable people to
make more informed choices]{.underline}, [faster.]{.underline} The
imperative for the Services and Joint Staff therefore is not to seek
grand system-of-system solutions, but rather to identify common and
recurrent operational tasks for which the addition of information, or of
more timely information, will help forces know where to be, what to
expect when they get there, and how to maximize their likelihood of
mission success. For the defense-wide organizations, the imperative is
to identify business questions that currently go unanswered, to find
ways to reduce transaction costs, to enhance productivity, and generally
to make the experience of working for the DoD better.

[The DoD acquisition process is an easy target for Silicon Valley's ire.
Yet it is far from clear that process reform alone will make the DoD a
better buyer.]{.underline} It is not wrong, after all, for the process
to demand that fiduciaries of public money articulate functional goals,
define achievable requirements, set feasible milestones, fund at
realistic levels, and be held accountable to those plans. But in the
absence of pragmatic, clearly defined strategies to drive acquisition,
[[process reform **on its own** will never deliver]{.mark} the
modernized military that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[needs.]{.underline}

A Market Mindset

Supporting those priorities is another matter altogether. [The current
approach---with the government funding only limited research and the
private sector taking care of commercializing the results---isn't
working. [Too much government-funded research remains locked in the
lab]{.mark}, unable to make the leap to commercial
viability.]{.underline} Worse, [when it manages to leave U.S. government
labs, it often ends up in foreign hands]{.underline}, depriving the
United States of taxpayer-financed intellectual property.

[The U.S. government will need to take a more active role in helping
research make it to the market. Many universities have created offices
that focus on commercializing academic research, but most federal
research institutions have not. That must change.]{.underline} In the
same spirit, [[the U.S.]{.mark} government [should
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} so-called sandboxes---[[public-private
research facilities where industry, the academy, and the government can
**work together**.]{.underline}]{.mark} In 2014, Congress did just that
when it established Manufacturing USA, a network of facilities that
conduct research into advanced manufacturing technologies. A similar
initiative for microelectronics has been proposed, and there is no
reason not to create additional sandboxes in other areas, too.

The U.S. government could also help with commercialization by building
national data sets for research purposes, along with improved privacy
protections to reassure the people whose information ends up in them.
Such data sets would be particularly useful in accelerating progress in
the field of artificial intelligence, which feeds off massive quantities
of data---something that only the government and a handful of big
technology companies currently possess. Success in synthetic biology,
along with wider medical research, will also depend on data. Thus, the
U.S. government should increase the quantity and diversity of the data
in the National Institutes of Health's genome library and curate and
label that information so that it can be used more easily.

[All this [help with commercialization will be for
naught]{.mark}]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [[if]{.mark} the
[startups]{.mark} with the [most promising]{.mark}
tech]{.underline}nologies [[for national security cannot attract]{.mark}
enough [capital.]{.mark} Some of them run into difficulties at the early
and late stages of growth: in the beginning, they have a hard time
courting investors willing to make high-risk bets]{.underline}, [and
later on]{.underline}, [when they are ready to expand]{.underline},
[they find it difficult to attract investors willing to write large
checks. To fill the gaps at both stages, [the U.S.]{.mark} government
[needs **its own investment vehicles**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We work at the parent company of [[In-Q-Tel]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
[[offers a promising model]{.mark} for early-stage
investment.]{.underline} Created in 1999 by the CIA, [In-Q-Tel is an
independent, not-for-profit firm that invests in tech]{.underline}nology
[startups that serve the national interest.]{.underline} (One early
recipient of In-Q-Tel's investment was Keyhole, which became the
platform for Google Earth.) Now also funded by the Department of
Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and other U.S. agencies,
[In-Q-Tel identifies and adapts innovative tech]{.underline}nologies
[for its government customers.]{.underline} Compared with a federal
agency, a private, not-for-profit firm can more easily attract the
investment and technology talent required to make informed investments.
[There is every reason to take this model and apply it to broader
priorities.]{.underline} Even just \$100 million to \$500 million of
early-stage funding per year---a drop in the bucket of the federal
budget---could help fill the gap between what the private sector is
providing and what the nation needs.

For the later stage, policymakers could draw inspiration from the U.S.
International Development Finance Corporation, the federal agency
responsible for investing in development projects abroad, which in 2018
was first authorized to make equity investments. A late-stage investment
fund could be structured as an arm of that agency or as a fully
independent, not-for-profit private entity funded by the government.
Either way, it would provide badly needed capital to companies ready to
scale up their operations. Compared with early-stage government support,
late-stage government support would have to be greater, in the range of
\$1 billion to \$5 billion annually. To expand the impact of this
government investment, both the early- and the late-stage funds should
encourage "sidecar" investments, which would allow profit-seeking firms
and individuals to join the government in making, and potentially
profiting from, technology bets.

Government-sponsored investment funds like these would not only fill
critical gaps in private-sector investment; they would also allow
taxpayers to share in the success of research their money has funded.
Currently, most government funding for technology comes in the form of
grants, such as the Small Business Innovation Research grants
administered by the Small Business Administration; this is true even of
some programs that are billed as investment funds. This means that
taxpayers foot the bill for failures but cannot share in the success if
a company makes it big. As the economist Mariana Mazzucato has pointed
out in these pages, "governments have socialized risks but privatized
rewards."

[[Not-for-profit investment vehicles]{.underline}]{.mark} working on
behalf of the government would have another benefit: they [[would allow
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to
**play offense**]{.mark} when it comes to tech]{.underline}nological
[competition. For too long, it has played defense.]{.underline} For
example, it has banned the export of sensitive technology and restricted
foreign investment that might pose a national security risk---even
though these actions can harm U.S. businesses and do nothing to promote
innovation. Supporting commercialization with government-sponsored
equity investment will not be cheap, but some of the upfront costs would
likely be regained and could be reinvested. There are also nonmonetary
returns: investing in national priorities, including infrastructure that
could be exported to U.S. allies, would enhance the United States' soft
power.

Innovation Ever After

President Joe [Biden has]{.underline} pledged to "build back better" and
restore the United States' global leadership. On the campaign trial, he
laid out promising proposals to promote American innovation. He [called
for dramatically [boosting federal]{.mark} R & D
[spending]{.mark}]{.underline}, including some \$300 billion to be
focused on breakthrough technologies to enhance U.S. competitiveness.
[That [is a good start, but]{.mark} he could make this drive far more
effective if he first created a rigorous process for identifying top
tech]{.underline}nological [priorities.]{.underline} Biden said he
supports "a scaled-up version" of the Small Business Innovation Research
grants and has backed "infrastructure for educational institutions and
partners to expand research." [Even [greater opportunity lies in filling
the gaps in private-sector investment and]{.mark} undertaking a
long-overdue [expansion of]{.mark} government support for
[commercialization.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[On innovation]{.underline}, [if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [opts for **just [more of the
same]{.mark}**]{.underline}, its economy, [its security]{.underline},
and its citizens' well-being [will]{.underline} all [suffer. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[will]{.mark} thus further
**the [end]{.mark} of its [global leadership]{.mark}** and **the
unfettered rise of China**.]{.underline} Biden has the right instincts.
Yet [in order [to **sustain its tech**]{.mark}**nological
[dominance]{.mark}**[, the country will have to **fundamentally
reenvision**]{.mark} the why and how of
[innovation.]{.mark}]{.underline} Biden will no doubt be consumed with
addressing domestic challenges, but he has spent much of his career
promoting the United States' global leadership. By revamping American
technological innovation, he could do both.

### 1AR --- Domestic Innovation Reform Fails

#### Allied integration is the [only]{.underline} way for the U.S. to win the tech race --- the Cold War proves.

[Washington is awash in [proposals to enhance
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [[innovation]{.underline}]{.mark},
[while at the same time limiting the extent to which that innovation
spreads to competitors like Russia and China. As the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [cannot rely on massive economic advantage over its
adversaries]{.underline} (China, anyway), [tech]{.underline}nological
[innovation appears to be the way to maintain U.S. military advantages
worldwide. In this context, does it make more sense to focus on offense
(enhanced innovation) or defense (protecting that innovation from
snoopers)?]{.underline}

[Many of the proposals for enhanced innovation]{.underline}, whether in
legislation or in think tank projects, have a few things in common. They
[[involve]{.mark} developing [human capital]{.mark} to pursue high-tech
fields, [making it easier for government to]{.mark} consistently
[access]{.mark} high tech]{.underline}nology[, [improving]{.mark}
government [funding]{.mark} for primary and applied research, and laying
the infrastructural foundations for further
[r]{.mark}]{.underline}esearch [[and d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment[.
On the defensive side, they envision [better cybersecurity, tighter
export controls]{.mark} on advanced tech]{.underline}nologies[, [and
better monitoring of foreign investment]{.mark} in the
tech]{.underline}nology [sector.]{.underline}

[[None of these are bad]{.mark} things, [**per se.** It cannot be
overstated]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[however]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[that]{.mark} the question of military tech]{.underline}nological
[[supremacy is intimately tied]{.mark} both [to]{.mark} **overall
economic performance** and to [**global economic integration**. The
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[won
the]{.mark} tech]{.underline}nological [race in the [Cold War]{.mark} in
large part [because it created and]{.mark} then [could rely upon a
**global network** of trade and innovation.]{.mark} China's
export-driven economy has benefited immensely]{.underline}, [from a
tech]{.underline}nological [point of view]{.underline}, [from its
integration into **global supply chains**.]{.underline}

This is another way of saying that [the tech]{.underline}nological
[aspect of U.S.-China competition will **not** focus fundamentally on
the appropriation or theft of particular kinds of military
tech]{.underline}nology. That was certainly an aspect of the Cold War,
in large part because the technological preconditions of the U.S. and
the USSR were so radically different. [Defensive measures should not be
ignored]{.underline}, [but [enhancing]{.mark} the [productivity]{.mark}
of the defense industrial base [will bring **higher dividends** than
protecting]{.mark} its products.]{.underline} Rather, [both Beijing and
Washington need to focus on **creating the preconditions of consistent
military tech**]{.underline}nological **[innovation]{.underline}**,
[remaining attentive to but **not paranoid** about what the other side
is doing.]{.underline}

[It seems likely that tech]{.underline}nological [competition will
**not** play out in terms of a single sharp break]{.underline}, [with
the jagged edges then protected by walls of export controls and travel
restrictions.]{.underline} The political, social, and economic logics of
China-U.S. trade relations are too deeply twined together to allow a
relationship similar to that which held between the U.S. and the USSR in
the 1950s and 1960s. [[The **best defense**]{.underline}]{.mark}, it
seems, [[will be to **lay the foundations** of a]{.mark} healthy,
[productive]{.mark}, [and innovative d]{.mark}efense [i]{.mark}ndustrial
[b]{.mark}ase[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
