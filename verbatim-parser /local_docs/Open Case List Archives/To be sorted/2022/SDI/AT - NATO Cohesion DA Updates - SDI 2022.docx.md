Turkey will not ratify membership of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization for the applicants [[if they don't fufill their promises
to]{.mark} combat terrorism and [extradite suspects]{.mark}]{.underline}
under a memorandum of understanding reached at an alliance summit in
Madrid last week, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Monday.

"They have to comply with this document, if they don't then we won't
allow them to join NATO," Cavusoglu told NTV television.

NATO Expansion Moves Ahead With Finland, Sweden Agreement

All 30 allies signed accession protocols for Sweden and Finland at a
ceremony in Brussels on Tuesday, making the countries formal invitees
and allowing them access to almost all NATO meetings. The protocol then
has to be ratified by allies' parliaments before the countries become
members.

[NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters that he is
counting on all allies to ensure a speedy ratification, and expects the
process to take "months."]{.underline}

[[Despite the Madrid agreement, Turkey's]{.mark} lingering [threat could
still complicate the membership process.]{.mark} Turkish President Recep
Tayyip [Erdogan is facing]{.mark} presidential and parliamentary
[elections]{.mark} within less than a year. [Being seen as adopting a
tough stance could consolidate support]{.mark} in nationalist
circles.]{.underline}

Erdogan said last week that the Turkish parliament will not ratify
Sweden and Finland's applications if they don't keep their written
promises on Turkey's security concerns, adding that Sweden had recently
pledged to extradite dozens of people Turkey views as terrorists, and
hand them over to Turkish authorities for prosecution.

Promise

"Sweden promised us that it will give us those 73 people," Erdogan said.
"We will now follow it up and we will make our decision accordingly."

Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde told reporters in Brussels that
"there is no mention of any list or any numbers in the memorandum." She
added that "during negotiations in Madrid there was also no mention of
any number or any specific lists."

The deal signed by Turkey, Sweden and Finland stated: "Finland and
Sweden will address Turkey's pending deportation or extradition requests
of terror suspects expeditiously and thoroughly, taking into account
information, evidence and intelligence provided by Turkey, and establish
necessary bilateral legal frameworks to facilitate extradition and
security cooperation with Turkey, in accordance with the European
Convention on Extradition."

[[Sweden's Supreme Court has rejected a]{.mark} large [majority of
extradition requests from Turkey]{.mark} in the past decade, and the
government has said that authorities will continue to follow Swedish
laws as it examines any petitions.]{.underline}

Fighting Terrorism

"It is important that we work against terrorism, but obviously we do so
according to Swedish laws and international conventions," [Prime
Minister]{.mark} Magdalena Andersson told reporters on a visit to the
island of Gotland this weekend. "If you are not engaged in terrorism,
you have no reason to be concerned."

[[Andersson]{.mark}, who declined to comment on any specific number of
extradition requests, stressed that [according to the country's laws,
Swedish citizens can't be extradited]{.mark}. A number of the persons
that are reportedly on the list of people Turkey wants extradited have
previously had their cases heard before the Supreme Court, which
rejected the requests.]{.underline}

#### Erdogan renewed his threat to prevent Finland and Sweden to join NATO -- Turkey will only agree if their requests are met

Erdogan renews threat to block Sweden and Finland from NATO Membership,"

**[Turkish President Recep Tayyip [Erdogan]{.mark} on Monday [renewed
his threat to \"freeze\" the Nato membership]{.mark} bids [of]{.mark}
both [Sweden and Finland unless the]{.mark} military [alliance complies
with Ankara\'s conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. After weeks of
wrangling, [[Turkey announced]{.mark} last month [the signing of a
memorandum]{.mark} with Finland and Sweden that opens the way for the
two countries to become Nato members]{.underline}. The two nations have
dropped their history of military non-alignment and announced plans to
join Nato in response to Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine. But new
countries\' applications must be approved by all members and ratified by
their respective parliaments. [Their bids were headed for swift approval
until Erdogan voiced concerns in May over the countries' support for
Kurdish militant groups which Ankara considers terrorist
groups]{.underline}. In addition[, the Turkish leader demanded the
Nordic countries lift arms embargoes imposed in response to Turkey\'s
2019 military incursion into Syria]{.underline}. \"I want to reiterate
once again that **[we will freeze the process if these countries do not
take the necessary steps to fulfil our conditions,\" Erdogan
said]{.underline}** Monday, on the eve of his trilateral summit with
Russia and Iran. \"[We particularly note that Sweden does not have a
good image on this issue]{.underline},\" he added. A 10-point memorandum
signed by the three sides on the sidelines of the Nato summit at the end
of June appeared to address many of Erdogan\'s concerns[. Turkish
officials say they will seek the extradition of 33 \"terror\" suspects
from Sweden and Finland as part of the agreement]{.underline}, although
the deal did not include specific references to extradition. [Turkish
dissidents in Sweden have expressed their fears that the deal might lead
to their extradition]{.underline}. The 33 individuals named by Turkey
are all accused of being either outlawed Kurdish militants or members of
a group led by the US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen, who Turkey blames
for a failed 2016 coup. Yet **[[Erdogan told reporters]{.mark} after the
summit [that the]{.mark} new [memorandum did not mean Turkey would
automatically approve]{.mark} the two countries\'
[membership]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The three-hour negotiations between
Erdogan and his Finnish counterpart Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister
Magdalena Andersson of Sweden in Madrid were tense, according to a
source with knowledge of the meeting[. Erdogan made clear that his
participation in the negotiations was only possible thanks to Nato
secretary general Jens Stoltenberg's invitation]{.underline}, the source
told Middle East Eye. [[Turkish officials]{.mark} involved in the
technical talks before the meeting [were happy with the progress]{.mark}
they had made]{.underline}. One senior Turkish official appreciated
Sweden's efforts to amend their laws to combat terrorism more
forcefully, even though they predated Turkey's demands. [[Yet]{.mark}
[Erdogan was not satisfied]{.mark}, with images of PKK flags flown
freely in demonstrations on Stockholm\'s streets and interviews with YPG
leaders on Swedish state TV. Both Kurdish factions are considered
terrorist groups by Turkey.]{.underline} Before the memorandum, there
had even been a debate in Ankara over giving Finland the green light
while maintaining that further negotiations with Sweden were needed. In
Madrid, negotiators saw little sign of a conciliatory approach, as
Erdogan used his opening remarks to repeat his red lines: the PKK being
allowed free rein in Swedish and Finnish cities; suspects linked to the
group not being extradited; and aid given to the YPG. Both countries
were still blocking arms exports to Turkey, he noted. The United States
and some Nato states have worked closely with the YPG to combat the
Islamic State group since 2014, a move that substantially undermined
Ankara's trust in its western allies. **[Erdogan responded by saying
that Finland and Sweden's Nato membership was not a birthright but a
privilege, so they don't set the rules.]{.underline}** "I want you to
abide by our red lines," Erdogan repeated, bringing the negotiations to
a stalemate. Sources said one fundamental disagreement was whether the
YPG and the movement of Fethullah Gulen should be designated as
terrorist groups. Sweden and Finland refused to recognise them as such
and then the parties took a break to contemplate. The solution was put
forward by Turkish intelligence chief Hakan Fidan, who said [[Erdogan
wouldn't sign a deal unless Sweden and Finland made]{.mark} clear
[commitments on the YPG and the Gulenists]{.mark}.]{.underline} "Instead
of designating them as terror groups, both countries clearly said in the
text of the memorandum that they would not provide support to these
specific groups, which broke the deadlock," said a source.

**[[Turkey will freeze Finland and Sweden\'s]{.mark} NATO membership
[bids if the Nordic countries do not keep promises on
counter-terrorism]{.mark} made last month]{.underline}**, President
Tayyip [[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark} said on Monday, adding he
[[believed Sweden was \"not showing a good image\" for
now]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Finland and Sweden applied for membership of
the defence alliance]{.underline} in response to Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine, [but were met with opposition from Turkey, which accused the
Nordic countries of supporting groups it deems terrorists.]{.underline}
The three countries signed an accord at the NATO summit in Madrid last
month to lift Ankara\'s veto in exchange for pledges on
counter-terrorism and arms exports. [[Turkey has said it will closely
monitor the implementation]{.mark} of the accord to ratify their
membership bids.]{.underline}

### Aff --- Burden-Sharing and Ukraine Thumper

#### [Burden-Sharing and Ukraine Strategy Thump]{.underline} --- the Summit [didn't]{.underline} resolve these [core disagreements]{.underline}.

*Did the summit reveal a newfound sense of NATO unity?*

[[The summit was an impressive show of resolve]{.mark} to counter
Russia's aggression]{.underline}, [including through continued
diplomatic, economic, and military support for Ukraine. NATO pledged to
further expand its military support for its vulnerable allies along the
Russian frontier. In particular, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [announced that it will establish a permanent
headquarters for its V Corps in Poland. Most important was the
eleventh-hour agreement that Turkey reached with Finland and
Sweden]{.underline}, [by which Ankara lifted its objections to their
joining the alliance and allowed NATO to begin the accession
process.]{.underline}

[[**However, challenges remain**. Burden-sharing is a **perennial
issue**:]{.mark} Even after Russia's assault on Ukraine, the majority of
members fall short of their commitment to spend at least 2 percent of
their]{.underline} gross domestic product ([GDP]{.underline}) [on
defense. The laggards include]{.underline}, [most
importantly]{.underline}, [Germany]{.underline}, [although it has taken
steps recently to meet that target as a multiyear average.]{.underline}
Moreover, [in the weeks ahead, the alliance's [resolve will be
tested]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as strains over]{.mark} **rising
[inflation]{.mark}** [and concerns over **energy** and **food supply**
mount]{.mark} across the Euro-Atlantic region.]{.underline} In recent
weeks, [[France, Germany, and Italy]{.mark} have [expressed interest in
finding a **negotiated settlement**]{.mark} to the
conflict]{.underline}, [which would likely leave some seized Ukrainian
territory in Russian hands. [That]{.mark} position [is **vehemently
opposed** by Poland and the Baltic states]{.mark}]{.underline}, [among
others. [Though]{.mark} those [differences were pushed into the
background during this summit, **they have not gone
away.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
