# Emerging Tech Innovation Negative

## Notes

### Explanation

#### This is a case negative against the Emerging Tech Innovation aff. It includes four new counterplan options and case answers. Notes about the affirmative are included at the top of the aff file.

### User's Guide

#### The negative has the following off-case options against the Emerging Tech Innovation case: 

#### NATO Cohesion DA

#### DOD AM&E Tradeoff DA

#### AI Bad DA (from the AI case negative)

#### Bilateral CP

#### State Department CP

#### Germany and Italy CP (with internal net-benefit)

#### Quad CP (with internal net-benefit)

#### Trilateral Israel-India-U.S. CP (with internal net-benefit)

#### Unilateral/Domestic CP

#### Security K

#### Be careful when designing case frontlines. If you are reading one or more of the DAs, you should not read impact defense that would take out your DA impact(s). To prevent mistakes, the case frontlines in this file have intentionally omitted typical impact defense cards. During the season, the negative should attempt to construct negative strategies with more "external" impacts so they can fully challenge the 1AC's impacts. For now, that wasn't realistic. 

## Germany and Italy CP

### 1NC --- Germany and Italy CP

#### Next off is the [Germany and Italy Counterplan]{.underline}. 

#### The Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Italy should substantially increase their defense spending and joint defense investment, including investment in defense innovation hubs and research and development in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and cybersecurity, and should invite the French Republic to join these initiatives. 

#### The counterplan solves [emerging tech innovation]{.underline} and [European strategic autonomy]{.underline}.

[[European defence is a **team game**.]{.mark} Following Germany's
decision]{.underline} on 27 February [to massively increase its military
budget in response to Russia's all-out war on Ukraine, other European
countries need to catch up]{.underline} -- [by adapting their own
defence planning and spending accordingly. Italy was one of several EU
member states that]{.underline}, soon after Berlin announced this huge
shift in policy, [called for a hike in defence spending to 2 per cent of
GDP in line with its commitments as a NATO member. Yet]{.underline},
[despite the initial fanfare over the move]{.underline}, [the Italian
government is now **vacillating**.]{.underline} The leader of the Five
Star Movement, Giuseppe Conte, recently expressed reservations about the
increase in military spending, explaining that "the priority must be to
protect families and businesses from the crisis".

Conte's statement is questionable not only because he participated in
NATO summits at which Italy committed to more military spending but also
because it suggests that increases in the defence budget and support for
people's livelihoods are mutually exclusive. As research by the RAND
Corporation shows, the defence industry has a value that goes beyond the
protection of a country and its population from adversaries -- it also
creates economic opportunities. Therefore, [[Italy should
**follow**]{.mark} **in [Germany]{.mark}'s footsteps** [by **increasing
defence spending** and developing a **closer alliance with
Berlin**]{.mark} on military matters.]{.underline} Indeed, [[**joint
defence investment** could substantially contribute to]{.mark}
industrial development and [integration]{.mark} in Europe.]{.underline}

Defence industrial cooperation between Italy and Germany has two
promising fronts, both of them in the air domain. The first is fighter
jets. During his dramatic announcement of Germany's new strategy,
Chancellor Olaf Scholz indicated that his government would likely
acquire the F-35 Lightning II instead of the F/A-18 Super Hornet as
previously planned. From an Italian perspective, this is good news for
two reasons. Firstly, it means more work for the FACO industrial plant
in Cameri, where Lockheed Martin assembles F-35s. Secondly, and most
importantly for Italy, Germany now seems more open to procuring the
designated successor to the F-35, the Tempest. British firm BAE Systems
and Italian company Leonardo lead the Tempest project, while France,
Germany, and Spain are cooperating on the comparable Future Combat Air
System programme. Germany's new approach could encourage Paris to
support a merger between the two initiatives -- a move that Italy and
Germany have long advocated.

Political support for defence industrial cooperation

European defence companies are already exploring potential opportunities
for such cooperation. In a recent interview with Italian newspaper Il
Sole 24 Ore, Rheinmetall CEO Armin Papperger indicated his firm's
willingness to expand its industrial networks in Italy by increasing
investments and strengthening cooperation with Oto Melara, a subsidiary
of Leonardo. Papperger explained that, "to underline the long-term
nature of our commitment, we are also prepared to make a financial
commitment by acquiring shares in Oto Melara." In this way, the firm
could become a springboard for a new role for the German defence
industry in Italy.

Rheinmetall wants to be involved in the modernisation of the Italian
Army, including through the supply of new armoured fighting vehicles
such as its Lynx models. The company would like to be the medium through
which Italy participates in the Main Ground Combat System programme --
which is designed to develop a European-made, next-generation heavy
tank. Accordingly, there is considerable potential for Germany and Italy
to begin a new era of defence industry collaboration -- one
characterised by what Italian ambassador to Berlin Armando Varricchio
calls a "much more integrated dimension".

However, such a defence marriage can only take place with the blessing
of the government in Rome. The government controls both Leonardo and
Fincantieri. And it will have a say in the planned sale of Oto Melara
and Wass, another Leonardo subsidiary. German defence companies are
keenly aware of the need for Rome's backing. "I am open to creating a
partnership in Italy", Papperger remarked in the interview with Il Sole
24 Ore, "but, of course, we need the agreement of the government, to
which we have explained our position".

[Italian leaders should recognise the political benefits of **closer
security and defence cooperation** with Germany. [In recent
years]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[Italy and Germany have been **at
odds**]{.mark} in areas ranging from migration to structural economic
reform.]{.underline} Although Mario [Draghi's election as Italian prime
minister has eased the tension between the sides, he and Scholz disagree
on key policy issues such as the reform of EU debt rules. [Determined to
**overcome these differences**, Italy and Germany have pledged to sign
an action plan for coop]{.mark}eration by mid-2022. [By **including
defence industrial coop**]{.mark}**eration in this pact**]{.underline},
[[they could]{.mark} match France's leadership in the area and
**[sustainably promote European strategic
autonomy]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- an issue that is important to
policymakers in Rome and Berlin.

A bilateral foundation for pan-European cooperation

[German-Italian cooperation]{.underline} of this kind [will need to be
**outward-looking** if it is to avoid being perceived as a threat to
other European defence industries, particularly]{.underline} that of
[France. Historically sceptical of German rearmament, France could
regard such cooperation as a challenge to its leadership of EU defence
policy. [Germany and Italy should be open to expanding]{.mark} their
joint defence industrial projects [to **include
France**.]{.mark}]{.underline} To this end, [their [efforts]{.mark} in
the area [should]{.mark} aim to [promote **complementarity**
between]{.mark} European [defence industries, value chains, and
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}

As such, [**[initially bilateral coop]{.mark}eration** [could **drive
broader European security and defence
integration**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, any ambitious defence
initiative within the European Union will require the support of
multiple member states. [Undertakings such as the E]{.underline}uropean
[I]{.underline}ntervention [I]{.underline}nitiative [and
P]{.underline}ermanent [S]{.underline}tructured
[C]{.underline}ooperation [are valuable formats in which Italy and
Germany can engage with other European countries on operational and
industrial issues. As part of the effort, they should try to spur the
development of **[European defence consortia]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
[which [would]{.mark} create a promising avenue through which to
[strengthen European **strategic autonomy**.]{.mark} While much
tech]{.underline}nological [[innovation]{.mark} has traditionally
started in the military realm before entering the civilian sector, it is
now [increasingly]{.mark} common for such innovation to [begin with
private]{.mark} and non-state actors before reaching the military
domain. This trend [calls for **closer**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**more
[sustained coop]{.mark}eration** between the civilian and military
sectors across Europe]{.underline}, [covering both government-owned and
private companies. [This is]{.mark} one of [the **key way**]{.mark}**s**
in which [Europe]{.mark}an governments [can address]{.mark} the
[challenges of]{.mark} decreased state control of [emerging
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[By backing pan-European defence industrial cooperation, the EU can
boost both economic innovation and its credibility as a geopolitical
actor. There is no strategic autonomy without a strong defence
industry.]{.underline} And [[coop]{.mark}eration [between Italy and
Germany can **breathe new life** into]{.mark} long-running [attempts to
**integrate European defence industries**.]{.mark} Italian
leaders]{.underline} are right to consider how defence spending affects
society as a whole, but they should not forget its benefits beyond the
security realm. They [have much to gain from becoming **credible
leaders** in this increasingly important policy area.]{.underline}

#### European strategic autonomy is crucial to de-escalate [African]{.underline} and [Middle East]{.underline} wars.

**Borrell 20** --- Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European
Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Vice-President of the
European Commission, former Minister of Foreign Affairs for the
Government of Spain, former President of the European Parliament, holds
a Ph.D. in Economics from the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain),
2020 ("Why European strategic autonomy matters," European External
Action Service---the diplomatic service and combined foreign and defence
ministry of the European Union, December 3^rd^, Available Online at
https://www.eeas.europa.eu/eeas/why-european-strategic-autonomy-matters_en,
Accessed 07-13-2022)

[Why is strategic autonomy salient more than ever?]{.underline}

[Because the world has changed. It is difficult to claim to be a
"political union" able to act as a "global player" and as a
"geopolitical Commission" without being "autonomous".]{.underline} What
are then the factors that make this concept more relevant than ever?

The first is that [the weight of Europe in the world is
shrinking.]{.underline} Thirty years ago, we represented a quarter of
the world\'s wealth. It is foreseen that [in 20 years, we will not
represent more than 11% of world GNP, far behind China]{.underline},
which will represent double it, [below 14% for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and at par with India.]{.underline}

The next two decades are going to be crucial because China will use them
to become the first global power, before becoming itself confronted with
new demographic constraints, which will slow its rise. The relay could
then probably be taken over by India.

[The conclusion is straightforward. If we do not act together now, we
will **become irrelevant**]{.underline} as many have argued cogently.
[[Strategic autonomy is]{.underline}]{.mark}, in this perspective, [a
process of [**political survival**.]{.mark} In such a context, our
[traditional alliances]{.mark} remain essential. **However**, they [will
**not be enough**.]{.mark} Since power gaps are shrinking, the world
will become **more transactional** and all powers]{.underline},
**[including Europe]{.underline}**, [will tend to be more transactional
too. This is an unescapable truth.]{.underline}

[The second factor has to do with the transformation of economic
interdependence]{.underline} in which we, as Europeans, have invested a
great deal, particularly through the defence of multilateralism. Today
we are in a situation where [economic interdependence is becoming
politically very conflictual. And]{.underline} what was traditionally
called [soft power is becoming an instrument of hard power.]{.underline}

[The Covid]{.underline}-19 [crisis has revealed the fundamentally
asymmetrical nature of interdependence]{.underline}, [and the
vulnerability of Europe. Science, tech]{.underline}nology[, trade, data,
investments are becoming sources and instruments of force in
international politics.]{.underline}

This is a very important change, which should lead us to strengthen all
the instruments beyond security and defence, in particular those
competences and instruments of the Commission that we have at our
disposal, to defend our interests.

[Another important reason is the shift in the world\'s focus towards
Asia, particularly in US policy.]{.underline} This trend did not start
with the Trump administration. The Obama administration initially
decided to withdraw the last US tank in 2013. However, following the
crisis in Ukraine it decided to bring back, on a rotational basis, an
armoured brigade. Still, the wider point stands, as also the German
defence minister said recently: "Only if we take our own security
seriously, will America do the same." I cannot agree more.

Additionally, [[Europe is]{.mark} today [confronted]{.mark} on its
periphery [with]{.mark} a certain number of [conflicts or tensions in
the **Sahel**,]{.mark}]{.underline} in [[**Libya**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[the **Eastern Mediterranean**.]{.mark} In
these]{.underline} three [cases [Europe must act]{.mark} even
[more]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and **alone**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[because these problems **do not**]{.mark} **primarily [concern the
U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates**[[.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

As one Polish scholar wrote, ["[the US will no longer be engaged in
large-scale military operations in **Africa** and the **Middle East**
and will **leave to Europe** crises and conflict resolution]{.mark} in
the European neighbourhood".]{.underline}

[Therefore]{.underline}, [[we need to **close**]{.mark} **many
[capability gaps and loopholes]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} to **[be present
and active]{.mark}** in areas where our interests are at stake. [In
conflicts like **Nagorno-Karabakh**, **Libya** as well as
**Syria**]{.mark}, [we are witnessing]{.mark} a form of
"**[Astanisation]{.mark}**" of regional conflicts]{.underline} (in
reference to the Astana format on Syria) [[which leads to the exclusion
of Europe]{.mark} from the settlement of regional conflicts [in favour
of **Russia** and **Turkey**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Why is this? How can this be remedied? Should it be accommodated? These
real questions must be asked within the framework of strategic autonomy.
[**[On these issues]{.mark}**, the exclusive reference to [NATO is **no
longer enough**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Escalation causes [global wars]{.underline} --- they're [highly likely]{.underline} without [active conflict management]{.underline}.

The year [2011 was a watershed in the]{.underline} Middle East and North
Africa ([MENA]{.underline}) [as]{.underline} the [popular
uprisings]{.underline} that cascaded through the region [precipitated
the collapse of several regimes at astonishing speed. These developments
in turn triggered [**civil wars** in **Libya**, **Syria**, and
**Yemen**]{.mark} that converged in dangerous ways, [rais]{.mark}ing the
[potential for a **wider conflict between regional actors**]{.mark},
directly or through proxies, including potent armed groups supported by
powers external to the region.]{.underline}

[Over ten years later, Yemen is going from bad to worse]{.underline},
[but the big war in Syria is for now frozen.]{.underline} The Islamic
State in Iraq and Syria ([ISIS]{.underline}) [is a shadow of its former
self]{.underline}, [and the Libyan civil war isn't raging on as it used
to. [Some]{.mark} of the intersecting [disputes have calmed
down]{.mark}---**at least [for the moment]{.mark}**---as states in the
region direct greater energies toward diplomacy.]{.underline}

**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[the situation remains **fragile** and
**could turn at the merest incident**.]{.mark} This could be a rocket
fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen landing in Abu Dhabi or Riyadh; a
Hezbollah rocket striking a school in Israel; an Israeli raid on Iranian
assets in Syria to which Iran retaliates by attacking the U.S. military
base at Al-Tanf with drones; an accidental confrontation between the
Iranian and U.S. navies in Persian Gulf waters; or any event of similar
impact]{.underline}, including what may follow a possible Donald Trump
return to the White House in 2025.

[The **[complexity]{.mark}** of the region's conflicts [has created
**unprecedented challenges for conflict management and
resolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [because wars may have **more
than one fundamental driver**. Addressing one may aggravate
another.]{.underline} Take Libya, for example: a deal to end the
conflict by forming a unity government will likely come at the expense
of improving governance and accountability, thus potentially giving rise
to new popular protests. Or Iraq: when the United States and the Kurds
fought ISIS together, Iraqi Kurdish leaders felt empowered to try for
independence in 2017. But their bid escalated an old conflict over
secession with the central government in Baghdad and neighboring
countries, triggering a fight in disputed territories.

[External intervention also tends to **exacerbate conflicts** more often
than help resolve them. Such meddling **draws in competing
forces**]{.underline}, [directly or by proxy]{.underline}--- for
example, Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen, or the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) and Turkey in Libya. [Another challenge is that armed non-state
actors]{.underline}, [presenting themselves as state-like entities but
without the true trappings of states]{.underline}, [are less
accountable. Meanwhile, the region's states themselves often start to
**crumble** through their partial loss of territorial control,
sovereignty, and authority. An additional complicating factor is that
the "international community" as a whole is going through a period of
**severe turbulence,**]{.underline} [in which multilateral institutions
are increasingly driven by internal zero-sum competition and are
**losing legitimacy and influence**.]{.underline}

[The continuation of [conflicts]{.mark} in the MENA region without the
prospect of a durable resolution---**[even if]{.mark} they are
[temporarily stalled]{.mark}**---raises two critical dangers. One is
that any conflict [can **metastasize at any point**]{.mark},
[covering]{.mark} **even [larger territories]{.mark}** [and
involving]{.mark} **a [greater]{.mark} number of
[actors]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The second is that **[external power
interventions]{.mark}** in places such as Syria where their interests
collide [can generate **hair-trigger situations** that could **spiral
rapidly out of control**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [possibly [with **global
consequences**]{.mark}. That is in addition to [the constant presence of
**regional conflict drivers**]{.mark} such as the struggle between Iran
and the Gulf monarchies or the continued Israeli military occupation of
Palestinian territories]{.underline}, [which [prevent conflicts from
coming to a negotiated conclusion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Under these circumstances, there is no direct or optimal approach to
tackling the region's conflicts. What [we are left with is trying to
find]{.mark} ways [to **manage and contain conflicts before they
intensify**]{.mark}. This [will require **diplomatic efforts** and
**tactical deals**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[as well as]{.mark} the
creation of **[channels of]{.mark} communication and [dialogue]{.mark}**
between adversaries [that can help **prevent unintended and
uncontrollable escalations**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Top-Level + Net-Benefit Explanation/Extension

#### Instead of increasing U.S. security cooperation with NATO, the counterplan increases [German]{.underline} and [Italian]{.underline} defense cooperation. This [solves the case]{.underline} by boosting [European defense investment]{.underline} in emerging tech. German and Italian joint investment will jumpstart European [defense industry integration]{.underline}, cementing [interoperability]{.underline} and convincing [other European countries]{.underline} to follow-on. This also strengthens Europe's [strategic autonomy]{.underline}, but [only]{.underline} if Germany and Italy [take the lead]{.underline} and establish [credible defense leadership]{.underline} --- that's Antinozzi and Varvelli. 

#### Strategic autonomy is vital to [de-escalate conflicts]{.underline} in [Africa]{.underline} and the [Greater Middle East]{.underline}. The U.S. has ceded these regions to Europe, but its lack of [credible military power]{.underline} and an [independent foreign policy]{.underline} prevents effective conflict resolution. That causes [hotspots]{.underline} like the [Sahel]{.underline}, [Libya]{.underline}, [Syria]{.underline}, and the [Nagorno-Karabakh]{.underline} to escalate --- that's Borrell.

#### African and Mid-East conflicts are [fragile]{.underline} and [on the brink]{.underline} of [sudden escalation]{.underline}. This will spark [larger regional wars]{.underline} that draw in [external powers]{.underline}. Only [sustained conflict resolution]{.underline} can prevent these inevitable conflicts from [escalating globally]{.underline} --- that's Hiltermann.

#### This [turns the case]{.underline} --- it decimates [NATO security]{.underline} and helps [Russia and China]{.underline} win the global strategic competition.

"We, the Heads of State and Government of the 30 NATO Allies, have met
today to address Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the gravest threat
to Euro-Atlantic security in decades." In this solemn statement released
after an extraordinary summit in Brussels on March 24, 2022, [NATO
leaders sent a clear signal: Russia poses an unprecedented threat that
the alliance needs to address as a matter of priority. Beyond its
decisions to assist Ukraine and reassure frontline allies, NATO is also
preparing for the long-term implications of the return of war to the
European continent.]{.underline} Incidentally, this reorientation
coincides with the preparation of a new strategic concept that will be
adopted in Madrid.

The strategic concept is arguably NATO's most important political
document as it scans the international security context, identifies the
main threats and challenges to Euro-Atlantic security, and outlines an
approach to addressing such challenges. The previous strategic concept,
adopted in Lisbon in 2010, signaled a meaningful rebalancing among
NATO's so-called core tasks, namely collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security. Inter-state competition took a
back seat because the alliance still hoped it could strike a cooperative
relationship with Russia despite the invasion of Georgia in 2008. The
return of great-power competition in Europe---arguably best illustrated
by Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014---forced allies to put
collective defense once again at the center of NATO strategy. Russia's
full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 is further compounding
this shift. A renewed commitment to territorial defense will undoubtedly
be at the forefront of the Madrid strategic concept.

[However, this should not lead NATO to neglect other
priorities]{.underline}, [including stability in its southern
neighborhood. Spanning from **North Africa** and **the Sahel** to the
**Balkans** and the **Middle East**, [NATO's "South" remains
**fraught**]{.mark} with many challenges---[and is not impervious
to]{.mark} the [**larger competition** with Russia and China.]{.mark}
**The [stability]{.mark} of the South [remains critical for
Euro-Atlantic security]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet the war in
Ukraine and prioritization of deterrence should also incentivize NATO to
reimagine how it engages with the South. Instead of relying on
large-scale military interventions as it did in Afghanistan, the
alliance should invest in strengthening its partners' resilience so they
can better resist both pressures from competitors and transnational
challenges. Promoting "forward resilience" will require NATO to be
innovative and to deepen its cooperation with other organizations,
starting with the European Union.

The End of an Era

In many ways, the 2010 Lisbon strategic concept draws on the previous
one (adopted in Washington in 1999). It represents a crystallization of
NATO's experience in the post--Cold War era, a unique period
characterized by Western unipolarity and military-technological
supremacy, as well as the seeming absence of peer competitors. Since the
end of the Cold War, the United States and its allies enjoyed a rather
favorable position in the pivotal regions of Europe and East Asia. There
was still a widely-held belief that former adversaries such as
Russia---and even emerging great powers such as China---could somehow be
integrated in the rules-based order. This belief underpinned much of the
thinking that shaped the Washington and Lisbon concepts.

The power surplus the United States and its allies enjoyed gave the West
a freer hand---both politically and militarily---to engage in ambitious
out-of-area endeavors and leverage crisis-management operations and
collective-security initiatives to help stabilize the broader
Euro-Atlantic neighborhood and beyond. NATO's operation in Afghanistan
illustrates this paradigm, as well as its limitations. During this long
post--Cold War era, collective defense and deterrence took a back seat.
Even though such goals remained the fundamentals of Euro-Atlantic
security, they were considered almost superfluous in light of the West's
military-technological supremacy. Crisis management and collective
security ruled the day, as illustrated by allies' military engagement
(whether under the NATO umbrella or in ad-hoc coalitions) in
Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, the Sahel, and Syria.

But this world is gone. Great-power competition (also dubbed "strategic
competition") is back---as illustrated by Russia's illegal annexation of
Crimea in 2014 and its increasingly revisionist and aggressive behavior
since, as well as by China's strategic rise and assertiveness, including
in the Euro-Atlantic area. Peer competitors are once again challenging
the security, geopolitical architecture, and U.S.-led alliances in
Europe and the Indo-Pacific, but also the institutional and normative
fabric that underpins the so-called rules-based or liberal international
order.

Adapting the alliance to this competitive era will arguably be the main
purpose of the new strategic concept, especially in light of Moscow's
brutal invasion of Ukraine. This will not only require revamping NATO's
deterrence and collective-defense pillars, but also ramping up allied
efforts in technological innovation and strengthening the resilience of
NATO countries against hybrid interference in the form of, for example,
cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns.

In parallel, the United States and its European allies have experienced
a mounting "intervention fatigue," as illustrated by the abrupt
withdrawal from Afghanistan. In Iraq and the Sahel, allies are also
reducing their military footprint and privileging a more tailored
approach to the fight against terrorism. "Over-the-horizon" operations
based on air strikes and special-forces raids seem to be the preferred
modus operandi after years of large-scale and intensive interventions.

The Risks of Neglecting the South

[A de facto prioritization of collective defense over crisis management
and collective security is probably unavoidable---but it is not without
**risks**.]{.underline} Notably, [[NATO's south]{.mark}ern neighborhood
[remains **structurally vulnerable**. Transnational challenges such as
**terrorism**, **organized crime**,]{.mark} the
**[prolif]{.mark}**]{.underline}eration [[**of small weapons**,
and]{.mark} **irregular [migration]{.mark}** [will]{.mark} arguably
[remain **core drivers of instability and insecurity**]{.mark} across
the South. Despite years of international diplomatic, development, and
security engagement, the **Sahel** continues to face mounting extremist
violence, internal displacement, and food insecurity. In **Libya**, the
political process to solve a years-long civil war is still very fragile,
while **Tunisia** has recently experienced worrisome political turmoil.
Although the **Islamic State** has lost its territorial stronghold in
**Syria** and **Iraq**, it remains active and resilient. Even the
seeming stability of the **Western Balkans** is misleading]{.underline},
[as illustrated by deep]{.underline}, [longstanding political tensions
between **Serbia and Kosovo** and within **Bosnia and
Herzegovina**.]{.underline}

[[Instability]{.mark} across NATO's South [is likely to be]{.mark}
further [compounded by]{.mark} the war in [Ukraine.]{.mark} In the
Western Balkans, the conflict has heightened fears that Russia's actions
may embolden nationalists, potentially leading to violence. Countries in
[Africa and the Middle East are already facing **spillover
effects**]{.mark} ranging from higher energy prices to food insecurity.
These countries are **particularly vulnerable** to the sharp decrease in
Russian and Ukrainian **wheat exports**]{.underline}, [raising concerns
that diminishing grain supply could fuel **ongoing crises** in **Syria**
or **Ethiopia** and aggravate instability in **Egypt** and
**Lebanon**.]{.underline} As UN secretary general António Guterres
underlined, [Russia's aggression of Ukraine is "planting the seeds for
political instability and unrest around the globe."]{.underline}

[[NATO's south]{.mark}ern neighborhood [is]{.mark} also [**an
increasingly relevant theater** in]{.mark} the West's **[strategic
competition]{.mark}** with Moscow and Beijing. The expansion of Russia's
**diplomatic and military presence** in the South]{.underline}, [whether
**directly** (as in **Syria**) or **indirectly** via proxies and private
military companies (as in **Libya** and **Mali**)]{.underline}, [is an
issue of growing concern. This **increasing military footprint** is
already affecting allied counterterror]{.underline}ism
[efforts]{.underline}, [as recently witnessed in the
**Sahel**.]{.underline} Taking advantage of Mali's political
instability, Russia's Wagner Group has managed to entrench itself in the
country, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of French and European
troops in February 2022. Far from contributing to the stability of Mali,
Russian mercenaries have already participated in mass killings there, as
witnessed in the town of Moura at the end of March.

[[Russia's]{.mark} increasing military [presence]{.mark}---and the
prolif]{.underline}eration [of Russian weapon systems---[may]{.mark}
also [fuel **arms races**]{.mark} in the South [and **endanger NATO's
security**]{.mark} in more traditional ways.]{.underline} For instance,
[Russian capabilities deployed in Syria have created **[interdiction
bubbles]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or anti-access/area denial zones,
[[limit]{.mark}ing [NATO's freedom of action]{.mark} in the Eastern
Mediterranean.]{.underline} The French navy has observed a significant
increase in the Russian navy's activity in the Mediterranean since the
beginning of the invasion, forcing a French carrier-strike group
deployed in the area to adapt its posture to avoid any
misunderstandings. More broadly, [Russian arms sales and the
prolif]{.underline}eration [of
p]{.underline}recision-[g]{.underline}uided [m]{.underline}unition[s and
missiles may also fuel arms races in places such as North
Africa]{.underline}, thus incentivizing the alliance to look at the
South through a deterrence lens as well.

[[China's]{.mark} growing political and economic [influence]{.mark} is
also affecting NATO's interests. China's acquisition of digital
infrastructure across the South]{.underline}---and its de facto monopoly
on the development of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks in
Africa---[[represents a **long-term political and military
challenge**]{.mark} to NATO [and could complicate the alliance's ability
to **work with its partners**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Similarly,
[[China's]{.mark} massive [investments]{.mark} in transport and energy
infrastructure in southern Europe [could]{.mark} potentially
**[complicate NATO's military mobility and readiness]{.mark} during a
crisis**. Beijing is also progressively expanding its military presence
along NATO's southern flank]{.underline}, [as demonstrated by
Chinese-Russian naval drills in the Mediterranean.]{.underline}

[As the world enters into a new period of **instability** and **great
power competition**]{.underline}, [European security cannot be given for
granted anymore. The times when the US was fully committed to European
defense and the continent lacked any meaningful peer
competitor]{.underline}, besides transnational threats such as piracy
and terrorism, [are **over**.]{.underline} In particular, [the return of
**Russia**, **Turkey** and **China** as great powers pose **significant
security implications** for Europe. This is especially true in light of
the recent U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [strategic tilt to
the Indo-Pacific and on the containment of China]{.underline}, [which
implies a diminished availability of resources and a minor willingness
to engage in military operations for the defense of Europe. As a
result]{.underline}, [Europeans are being forced to spend more in their
armed forces and think more strategically to defend their national
security]{.underline}, [**without having to rely too much on
Washington**. [France and the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}ingdom, the two countries with the most powerful
militaries in Europe, [[do not seem **capable** and **willing**]{.mark}
of covering the **whole spectrum** of threats. Thus]{.underline}, [[the
rest]{.mark} of European countries [**should do more** and **increase
their share of responsibility**]{.mark} for European defense. While many
improvements have been reached in the last five years,]{.underline} such
as higher defense spending and the launching of PESCO and the European
Defense Fund to increase interoperability among the armed forces of the
continent and the development of military technology, [these efforts are
**not enough** to guarantee an acceptable level of European security if
two key countries]{.underline}, [[**Italy** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
especially **[[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [do not **fully commit**
their military and political institutions to this cause. Because of
their **geographical position** and **economic resources**, these two
nations [are **essential** to tackle the **present** and **future**
challenges]{.mark} to European security and prosperity.]{.underline}

[Due to its central location at the heart of Europe and as the biggest
economy]{.underline} of the continent, [[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark} in
particular, [[has always been **the cornerstone**]{.mark} **of European
stability and defense**.]{.underline} For centuries and for better or
worse, Germany's weakness or strength have decided the fate of the
continent. Nowadays, Berlin plays chiefly an economic role of
semi-hegemony with a high degree of political influence. However, unless
Germany also become a military power commensurate to its economic and
technological resources, and it assumes more security responsibility, it
cannot be regarded as a fully-rounded geopolitical power. And this is a
problem for European security, for [[a weak Germany]{.mark} also [means
a vulnerable Europe.]{.mark} As]{.underline} the [former foreign
minister of Poland]{.underline} Radoslaw [Sikorski said]{.underline} in
2011 during the Euro financial crisis, ["I fear German power less than I
am beginning to fear German inactivity. You have become **Europe's
indispensable nation**."]{.underline} This condition is primarily due to
its recent history in Second World War, after which German leaders have
developed a pacifist, economy-oriented and non-strategic attitude to
questions related to foreign policy and military affairs. This can be
clearly observed in the reluctance in engaging in military missions
abroad and in the precarious state of its armed forces.

[Germany]{.underline}, in fact, [spends only 1.4 % of its GDP in
military]{.underline}, compared to the NATO benchmark of 2 %, not to
speak of other countries such as the United States and Russia which
spend more than 3 %. [This lack of [funding and focus]{.mark} on armed
forces is also reflected on the level of readiness of the Bundeswehr and
on the number of troops and weapons available. They [are]{.mark} simply
**[not enough]{.mark}** in face of the security challenges the country
is called to face. Germany is also reluctant to lead Europe
geopolitically as this evokes its dark history]{.underline}, [and thus
preferring to let the French and the Americans take the lead in matters
of foreign policy and defense. Once a tech]{.underline}nologically
[powerhouse with arguably the best engineers and scientists in the
world, [Germany is also **lagging behind**]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and other countries [when it
comes to]{.mark} the development of **[new
tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nologies [and the digitalization of its
society. This relative absence of innovative spirit is partly related to
Germany's lack of great-power ambition and a reluctance to invest
significantly in high-risk military projects capable of overcoming the
so-called "the valley of death" and bring about new
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[Although Germany has only recently started to address these issues by
adopting a more assertive foreign policy, allocating more resources to
the military budget and developing future tech]{.underline}nologies[,
these changes **do not seem to be enough**. Berlin is set to reach the
2% NATO military expenditure only by the early 2030s and some parties
even question this goal;]{.underline} for several reasons, [[it is
**unlikely to catch up**]{.mark} **technologically** with the US and
China with regard to **new disruptive tech**]{.underline}nologies [such
as AI and quantum tech]{.underline}nologies[; and most importantly there
are not many signs suggesting an attitude change toward the use of the
armed forces for geopolitical goals. While this role of [Germany as a
"tamed power"]{.mark} allows its European neighbors to sleep well at
night, eventually it [makes Europe **weaker**, more dependent]{.mark} on
other countries [and more exposed to **external interference**]{.mark}
and **security challenges**.]{.underline} Conversely, [[a stronger
Germany would **reinforce**]{.mark} **the Western [deterrence against
Russia]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} it would [**discourage Turkey's aggressive
foreign policy**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, as Europe's economic
powerhouse but with a latent technological potential unexpressed,
[[Berlin]{.mark} **could and [should play a fundamental role]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the development of Europe's **[strategic autonomy]{.mark}**
and sovereignty in order to be **more competitive with the economic and
tech**]{.underline}nological [**superpowers** of the US and
China.]{.underline} Thus, [considering the American pivot to Asia and
the difficulties for the rest of European countries to provide for their
own security, Germany's leading economic role and security guarantees
are **needed more than ever**.]{.underline}

[Italy too]{.underline}, [has an important geopolitical role to
play]{.underline} even though this is not properly recognized most of
the times. A quick look at the geopolitics of Italy, its resources and
the security challenges toward Europe, one immediately understands the
strategic importance of the country. [Given]{.underline} the fact [that
it is the third largest economy in the EU]{.underline}, ranking second
in its manufacturing output in Europe after Germany [and]{.underline} it
[is situated in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea with deep
diplomatic, historical and cultural links to North Africa and the
Middle-East, [Italy is an **essential factor** in the **stabilization**
and **resolution of**]{.mark} **Europe's [security problems]{.mark}**
[in its **southern flank**.]{.mark} Libya and the management of
migration flow are certainly the most important areas where Italy plays
a fundamental role. Libya is becoming a contested area among great
powers, fostering further destabilization and driving large number of
migrants to Italian shores and successively to the rest of Europe. This
causes the rise of extremist political forces]{.underline}, [as well as
creating negative collateral effects for European cohesion and
stability.]{.underline} Hence, [[Rome should adopt a **more assertive
foreign policy**]{.mark} in Libya]{.underline}, including the use of
military forces, [so as [to **stabilize**]{.mark} the country and help
its recovery.]{.underline}

In addition, [with the rise of Turkey]{.underline}, despite being in an
economic crisis currently, [as an aggressive and revisionist regional
power that is willing to use military power for geopolitical goals and
to expand its sphere of influence in North Africa]{.underline} (e.g.
Libya) [and south-east Europe, Italy could also play an important role
in the balance of power against Turkey and other antagonistic powers in
the Mediterranean. [Rome]{.mark}]{.underline} has a bigger GDP than
Turkey, a similar population and a relatively strong navy that [[could
operate as]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**powerful deterrence** against
Ankara.]{.mark} [However,]{.mark}]{.underline} similarly to Germany,
[[Italy is hesitant]{.mark} to develop an assertive foreign policy and
to deploy military resources for geopolitical goals. Its defence
expenditure is only 1.6 % of]{.underline} the [GDP. [This **weakens the
southern front**]{.mark} of Europe [and leaves it open to **external
incursions**]{.mark} and the rise of other powers]{.underline}, [such as
Turkey.]{.underline} Different from Germany though, in the last three
decades Italy has been ravaged by a dysfunctional political and economic
system that is gradually eroding the country's geopolitical power.
Unless Rome fixes its structural problems, it will be difficult for the
country to regain international credibility and play a meaningful role
in European affairs and in the security of the continent.

Therefore, I argue that [[a **more active and assertive foreign policy**
by Germany and Italy]{.mark} in their respective areas [is warranted to
**strengthen European security and power**.]{.mark} The unwillingness of
these two countries]{.underline} and the Italian incapacity [to do so
affect **the whole continent**. Rome and Berlin should learn again how
to think strategically and how to use military power to reach political
ends and defend their national interests]{.underline}, in the same way
as other great powers do. [They should also embrace a **more innovative
and risk-taking spirit**]{.underline}, a characteristic of big powers,
[which allows constant innovation and growth]{.underline} of the economy
to happen. To do so, structural changes are needed in both cases,
especially for Italy. However, such a prospect is unlikely to
materialize in the short-medium term as strategic cultures and political
institutions persist through generations and they usually change only
after dramatic and historical events like a war, or with a shift in the
dominant narrative, which could slowly lead to a different zeitgeist.

Strengthening the Network

[Improving NATO and E.U. defense cooperation requires **looking under
the hood** to appreciate the role of these efforts. Scholars have
already pointed out that Europeans must recognize the minilateral
foundations of Europe's security architecture. This corresponds with my
experience as a **former defense official**. European
[ministries]{.mark} of defense **[do not always think in terms of
institutions like the E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [[**and NATO**.]{.mark} They have their
own considerations]{.underline}, [and [they are using **the framework
that fits their goals the best**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which can be
**NATO**, **the E**]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion[[, or **smaller formats**.
Starting]{.mark} an initiative [at this level is often **more
effective** and can provide results **more
quickly**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As I argue in my newly published book, [while these forms of cooperation
are not new, their recent proliferation is unprecedented in Europe's
history.]{.underline} Furthermore, [[they provide **the substance of
practical military coop**]{.mark}**eration in Europe**]{.underline},
[[which NATO and the E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [[can **build on**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
Thus, [comprehending the dynamics behind them is crucial to foster
**effective defense cooperation** moving forward.]{.underline} The
research in my book indicates that when European nations start new
defense collaborations, five structural and situational factors are
important to achieve success.

[A History of **Bilateralism** and **Minilateralism**]{.underline}

In a few months, NATO countries have deployed thousands of troops and
significant capabilities to enhance the defense of members on its
eastern flank. In a stunning transition, two traditionally militarily
non-aligned E.U. states, Sweden and Finland, re-evaluated their
geostrategic position and submitted applications to join NATO. [The
debate about boosting the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion['s
["**strategic autonomy**"]{.mark} has become even more
intense]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} once again, [member states are
discussing coordinating their defense spending via joint
procurements.]{.underline}

[These vital initiatives [could not work without]{.mark}
existing]{.underline}, [critical [lower-level
collab]{.mark}oration[s.]{.mark}]{.underline} For example, Russian
military actions over the last several years in Ukraine prompted NATO's
eastern-flank allies to work swiftly together with their bi- and
minilateral partners. The United Kingdom took on a leading role in
Estonia, building on the close relations the two countries developed
carrying out dangerous operations over a decade in Afghanistan's Helmand
province. Lithuania is a relevant defense market for Germany, and not
surprisingly, the Bundeswehr leads NATO efforts there. Thanks to
cultural similarity and extensive previous military cooperation, the
Czech Republic has sent the most troops to Slovakia and oversees the
international forces located there. For similar reasons, France deployed
500 troops to Romania. [Such [**comparatively low-key actions** were
crucial in developing the **necessary bottom-up relations**, **norms**,
and **experiences** upon which]{.mark} more recent [grandiose
announcements build.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Although Finland and Sweden intend to join NATO, they also found it
essential to sign bilateral mutual security deals with the United
Kingdom. This could happen quickly, mainly because Helsinki and
Stockholm have built trust with London working together in the
British-led Joint Expeditionary Force. The dynamics in the European
Union are the same as in NATO. For example, in 2017, the European Union
established the Permanent Structured Cooperation to strengthen defense
cooperation among its member states after the Russian occupation in
Crimea. However, most of its projects were based on existing bi- and
minilateral defense initiatives, and the participating states often just
rebranded them according to the new E.U. vocabulary.

[The fact that existing [bi- and minilateral relationships are **the
foundation of defense coop**]{.mark}**eration** in Europe is not a new
phenomenon. A survey of **[70 examples]{.mark}** of European defense
collaboration [highlighted]{.mark} that [most have five or fewer]{.mark}
participating [states]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and many are]{.mark}
purely [bilateral.]{.mark} These collaborations range from creating
multinational units to cooperating on armaments, training, logistics,
surveillance, operations, and/or command and control. More often than
not]{.underline}, [[these collab]{.mark}oration[s are **not part of
NATO** or the E]{.mark}]{.underline}uropean
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion, [**[but they can be rebranded as E.U. and
NATO projects quickly if]{.mark} it is
[necessary]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[States can]{.mark} also [use these collab]{.mark}oration[s to **shape
NATO and E.U. policies**. For instance, the NATO op]{.mark}eration [in
Libya]{.mark} in 2011 [was]{.mark} basically [an Anglo-French
war]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as France and Britain pushed for the
intervention and took the brunt of the fight. They used NATO's command
structure to coordinate their war effort and the limited military
support they gained from some NATO members helped fill their capability
gaps. The background of this was a historical and overarching
British-French bilateral defense agreement]{.underline}, the Lancaster
House Treaties, [which the leaders of the two European military powers
signed a year earlier.]{.underline} The launch of the European Union's
European Security and Defence Policy in 1999 also stemmed from a
British-French bilateral agreement in St. Malo in 1998 as well.

A Transatlantic Division of Labor in Crisis Management

Finally, [[allies should strengthen their ability to act rapidly
in]{.mark} the event of [a crisis in the south]{.mark}ern
neighborhood.]{.underline} In this regard, [allies should reckon with
the reality that]{.underline}, [despite Russia's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}, [China remains [Washington's]{.mark} "most
consequential strategic competitor" and a "[pacing challenge]{.mark}"
that [will inevitably require]{.mark} a [recalibration]{.mark} of the
U.S. presence in Europe and its vicinity in the medium term. [This will
compel]{.mark} European [allies to take up greater
responsibilities]{.mark} in security and defense.]{.underline}

[As Europeans step up their defense spending and efforts, NATO will
arguably remain their **main referent** when it comes to deterrence and
collective defense. **However**, [when it comes to **crisis management
in the South**, Europeans may prefer to act in **smaller coalitions** or

[But]{.underline}, German and Italian action sets the foundation for [future]{.underline} NATO adoption. Winning "follow-on" doesn't take out the DA link because it's an issue of [policy sequencing]{.underline} --- bilateral and minilateral policies must be adopted [first]{.underline} before being [scaled up]{.underline} to the multilateral level.

#### Multi-actor international fiat [in this context]{.underline} is good:

#### 1. [Topic Education]{.underline} --- the question of [who]{.underline} should act is [central]{.underline} in debates about NATO and transatlantic relations. Considering the [comparative]{.underline} strengths and weaknesses of the U.S. and its allies is crucial to [in-depth policy analysis]{.underline}. This outweighs minor fairness concerns because they're only a [means to the end]{.underline} of encouraging [deeper topic knowledge]{.underline} and [policy comparison skills]{.underline}. 

#### 2. [Neg Ground]{.underline} --- core generic arguments about [European strategic autonomy]{.underline} and [institutional alternatives to NATO]{.underline} aren't [strategically viable]{.underline} without international fiat. Excluding them hurts [fairness]{.underline} by artificially shielding the aff from [important literature-based disagreements]{.underline}. 

#### 3. [International Perspective-Taking]{.underline} --- international fiat forces students to [understand]{.underline} and [empathize with]{.underline} foreign perspectives. Their interp enforces a dangerous [American exceptionalism]{.underline} that limits our [policy imaginations]{.underline} and implicitly indoctrinates us with an [ethnocentric worldview]{.underline}. International fiat allows students to study Europe as an [actor]{.underline}, not just as an [object]{.underline} that the U.S. [acts upon]{.underline}.

If anything, [French President]{.underline} Emmanuel

[Commentators on both sides of the Atlantic have now jumped into the
fray to argue about the strength of the Alliance or the wisdom of such
public pronouncements by one of NATO's most important

Let's get hasty readings out of the way. Macron does not want NATO to be
"brain-dead." By replying "I don't know" to a question about whether
NATO's Article Five mutual defense clause was effective, he is not
signaling French reluctance to come to the aid of NATO allies. He is
rather taking stock of the current travails of the Alliance, of the lack
of coordination regarding Syria, and of the doubts cast by what he calls
the "guarantor of last resort": the United States.

Some commentators have seen the interview as a vindication of their
critiques of US policy towards NATO, and more broadly towards alliances,
under US President Donald J. Trump. Others have rushed to contradict
Macron's assessment, highlighting official statements, Congressional
action, and public opinion that demonstrate full support for NATO, as
well as pointing out the continued US presence in Europe (such as the
European Deterrence Initiative and the large scale exercise Defender
2020).

[But that is missing the point. This interview is not about NATO. It is
not even really about the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[. It
[is about **Europe**]{.mark}. About deep worries that it is gradually
[being on the **menu** of global power politics and]{.mark} about [the
means to ensure that it is **at the table
instead**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[What Macron sees is a world that is increasingly dangerous for
Europeans. A world in which authoritarian regimes are on the rise,
instability and terrorism persists in the vicinity of Europe, and
history returns in the form of great power competition. A world in
which]{.underline}, regardless of who sits in the White House, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [focus is moving away from
Europe. To face that world, he fears Europe is still a house divided,
has partly forgotten it is a political project and not a market,
and]{.underline}, most of all, [shies away from asserting its very real
power on the world stage.]{.underline}

This should not come as a surprise. This has been his constant worry,
from his 2017 Sorbonne speech to his August 2018 proposals about
deepening the EU's solidarity clause, to his calls for a European
Army---a call to be understood as powerful image, not read literally of
course---to his address this summer at the annual ambassadors meeting,
where he laid out his Russia policy.

And he offers some solutions. The first is strengthening European
military capabilities. As Macron puts it "these days, if you don't have
military credibility, in a world where authoritarian powers are on the
rise again" you don't get to sit at the table. Arguably, progress has
been made there, with the launch of the European Intervention
Initiative, the European Defense Fund, and the Permanent Structured
Cooperation. European defense budgets are on the rise. As the French
defense minister Florence Parly explained at the Atlantic Council last
March, France is quite clear-eyed about the long-term effort required to
address European shortfalls and about the value of US support.

The second strand to engage is Russia---because Europeans cannot ignore
their large neighbor. This does not mean, of course, being naïve about
Russian intentions. The third, and arguably most important piece of the
puzzle, is to get Europe to think geopolitically. The brunt of the
interview seemed to revolve around a call for Europe to wake up to its
potential on the world stage. Europe must think about issues such
digital policy, trade, or technology not solely through an economic
lens, but also realize that these are increasingly becoming instruments
akin to hard power---instruments that Europe, through the European
Union, is well placed to wield. Is that so different from Ursula von der
Leyen, the incumbent Commission president, presenting a "Geopolitical
Commission"? From Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte noting that "the EU
needs a reality check...if we only preach the merits of principles and
shy away from exercising power in the geopolitical arena, our continent
may always be right, but it will seldom be relevant"?

There are many entertaining discussions to be had about whether Macron's
interview epitomizes the return of Gaullo-Mitterrandism or is simply the
French equivalent of an early morning tweet. [There is certainly a
debate to be had about whether the form, wording, and timing of Macron's
comments were useful. But [Macron's argument is]{.mark} much [more about
**Europe's future** than]{.mark} simply a judgement on [**NATO's
present**. He is asking a **very important question**: "how can Europe
survive---and thrive---in a world of carnivores?"]{.mark} This is where
[those who care about the]{.mark} transatlantic [alliance should be
**engaging him**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### 4. [Functional Limits]{.underline} --- forcing the aff to win a "U.S. key" advantage --- *[not just "NATO key"]{.underline}* --- significantly limits the number of viable cases. This creates a more manageable research burden for [everyone]{.underline}, enabling and encouraging [higher-quality research]{.underline} and [case-specific preparation]{.underline}.

U.S. President Joe [Biden]{.underline} last month [made a historic trip
to Tokyo]{.underline}, [where he met with the prime ministers of the
other countries in the]{.underline} Quadrilateral Security Dialogue,
known as the [[Quad]{.mark}: Australia, India, and Japan. The four
[leaders reaffirmed]{.mark} their commitment to a free, open, inclusive,
and resilient Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, [as well as their [interest in
collaborating on]{.mark} critical and [emerging
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [such as]{.underline} artificial
intelligence ([AI]{.underline})[.]{.underline} 

[AI has taken **center stage** for the Quad. In the last five years, all
four countries have announced national AI strategies aiming to leverage
the tech]{.underline}nology [for societal development, economic
prosperity, and military power. Beyond national agendas and investments,
the [Quad countries]{.mark} also [see **multinational
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [**[collaboration]{.mark}** with
like-minded democracies [as key to responsible]{.mark} AI
[development.]{.mark} Promising to promote an accessible and secure
tech]{.underline}nology [ecosystem, [Quad-led]{.mark} AI [collaboration
could]{.mark} also [help **counter China's disruptive behavior**]{.mark}
in the region, particularly the country's malicious use of AI for
surveillance, censorship, and misinformation.]{.underline}

[While the Quad is not a formal alliance, [its flexible
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}, [atop a strong foundation of bilateral
and multilateral ties]{.underline}, [[allows room for
**experimentation** and **agility**]{.mark} in collective efforts.
During previous meetings, the Quad launched the Critical and Emerging
Tech]{.underline}nology [Working Group and released joint statements on
technology design, development, governance and use. At the Quad Summit
in Tokyo, they followed up with a number of initiatives]{.underline}
including the official launch of fellowships for leading STEM graduate
students, and a new memorandum of cooperation on 5G Supplier
Diversification and Open RAN. The Quad countries also introduced several
new initiatives, among them an Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime
Domain Awareness, a Quad Investors Network, a Quad Cybersecurity
Partnership, and an International Standards Cooperation Network to share
information on technical standards.

[**[But moving from statements to coordinated]{.mark} and [collective
action]{.mark}** [is no easy task.]{.mark} Regulatory barriers such as
differences on national data sharing laws can hinder the implementation
of joint initiatives.]{.underline} Moreover, [different geopolitical
priorities]{.underline}, [as illustrated by India's reluctance to join
the sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine]{.underline},
[could sour the relationship.]{.underline} In addition, [each of the
Quad countries has significant economic and trade ties with
China]{.underline}, [which could further complicate the group's
collaborative tech]{.underline}nology [agenda. ]{.underline}

The May 2022 summit therefore comes at an opportune time, as [[the
future of the Quad as a strategically important forum for
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[cooperation **hangs in the
balance**. ]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Our recent report]{.underline} from Georgetown University's Center for
Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) [examined trends in joint
AI-related research publications and investment in AI companies within
the Quad over the past decade. Our findings show that while Australia,
India, and Japan each have robust AI research partnerships and
investment ties with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[, the
three Indo-Pacific nations collaborate far less with one
another. ]{.underline}

Looking at internationally co-authored scholarly publications between
2010 and 2020, it appears that AI researchers in Australia, India, and
Japan collaborated with U.S. AI researchers at least five times more
often than they did with one other. Similarly, while the United States
is the largest foreign investor in Australian, Indian, and Japanese AI
companies, there is little AI investment activity between the three
Indo-Pacific countries. 

Moreover, despite increasing tensions with Beijing, each of the Quad
countries' AI ecosystems are closely intertwined with China's powerful
AI research apparatus and market. In fact, China is the top research
partner for the United States and the second leading partner for the
rest of the Quad members. And not only does the United States have far
more AI investment activities with China than with Australia, India, and
Japan individually, but each of these three Quad members have closer
ties to China than they do with one another. 

Scientific research collaborations and financial activities often
operate on a separate plain from national security imperatives. Indeed,
there is much to gain from an open scientific system and global flows of
investment capital. And in a sense, the Quad's close linkages with China
will hardly come as a surprise given that the country is a global leader
in scientific research and has a massive economy and technology market. 

That said, there are valid concerns about research integrity and
security, as well as overdependence on the Chinese market, technology,
and capital. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has launched numerous
simultaneous strategies to advance China's global position as a science
and technology powerhouse, including by relying on foreign technology
transfer and intellectual property theft from leaders in emerging
technologies such as the Quad countries. The CCP is also using
AI-enabled technologies for human rights violations against the
country's minority population, and exporting AI surveillance
technologies worldwide. 

[Over the past several years, the Quad countries have all launched
different initiatives to strengthen their domestic AI ecosystems, expand
research and investment ties with one another, and enforce greater
scrutiny over China's misuse of tech]{.underline}nology[.]{.underline}
For example, the governments of Japan and India signed the 2018
Japan-India Digital Partnership agreement to link Japanese venture
capital investors to Indian startups. The recently introduced Quad
Investors Network will bring together investors with the goal to
increase access to capital for emerging technologies within and across
the Quad countries.

Meanwhile, India and the United States launched the U.S.-India
Artificial Intelligence Initiative in 2021 to promote bilateral R&D
collaboration through networking and workshops, among others. As these
initiatives begin to take shape, tracking their progress will help
inform policymakers across the Quad countries of gaps and opportunities
to expand collaboration among all members.

[As the Quad agenda on tech]{.underline}nology [cooperation continues to
evolve, it\'s worth remembering that ad hoc groupings like the Quad work
best when the barriers to coordination between the countries involved
are low and the potential payoffs are high.]{.underline} In this vein,
one potentially promising area for collaboration is on
privacy-preserving machine learning techniques (PPML) that could enable
data sharing on commercial and non-commercial datasets without
triggering privacy concerns and could reduce cybersecurity risks by
protecting individual data while preserving its usefulness. The U.S.-EU
Trade and Technology Council has already initiated efforts to identify
common projects utilizing privacy-enhancing technologies. As for the
Quad, the four countries can co-fund joint research or coordinate
investments into PPML and other techniques like synthetic data and
advanced simulations that make personal data less relevant for AI
systems.

[The White House's Indo-Pacific Strategy is clear about the need for
U.S. allies and partners to strengthen their ties with one another.
[Boosting]{.mark} AI-related [collaboration between Australia, India,
and Japan can reassert the Quad as a pillar of stability]{.mark} in the
Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}, [[as well as help the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[achieve its
strategic objectives.]{.mark} With all eyes on the Quad, the group must
deliver on its promises.]{.underline}

#### Adopting the counterplan [alone]{.underline} is key to the Quad's [credibility]{.underline} and [effectiveness]{.underline} --- the perm poisons relations with [India]{.underline}, hamstrings allied [China policy]{.underline}, and [weakens NATO]{.underline}.

[[NATO is]{.mark} a shady organization]{.underline}. First, [it expanded
eastward in Europe]{.underline} -- [breaking all promises made to the
former Soviet Union that it will never do so]{.underline}, and now, [it
is [looking to make an entry into the Indo Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Mind you, [[NATO would have been welcomed with wide arms to the region
had it not been playing its dirty games against select
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, at the behest of the Biden
administration, [[NATO is looking to undercut the influence of India in
this crucial region. New Delhi will not tolerate
this]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Recently, after the G7 summit in Brussels, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida held talks with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
[[Stoltenberg said the bloc would work more closely with]{.underline}
["Asia-Pacific partners", which include "Japan as well as South Korea
and Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}[."]{.underline}

Where's India, Mr Stoltenberg?

There were two very stark anomalies. First, [the NATO Secretary-General
did not mention India]{.underline}. [What that means is that [NATO is
looking to expand its influence in the Indo-Pacific without
India]{.mark}. [NATO wants to undercut India's influence in the region,
and project it as a player which does not matter]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So, while every QUAD country figures prominently in NATO's Indo-Pacific
plans, India finds no name on the list.

Secondly, [the NATO chief referred to the Indo-Pacific as the "Asia
Pacific". This is the terminology that China uses for the
region]{.underline}. So it gives a clear picture of the catering deeds
that [Nato is currently into. How will NATO counter China when it cannot
even muster the courage to use the right terminology]{.underline}?

But wait, [[using the term "Asia Pacific]{.mark}" [cuts out India from
the picture even further]{.mark}! So, just [because India refuses to toe
the line of]{.mark} the Biden administration and [NATO on several
issues, the bloc has decided to alienate New Delhi.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But [[any strategy to counter China in the Indo Pacific will fail unless
India is onboard with it]{.mark}. France, which is by far the most
proactive European power in the Indo Pacific considers India a brother
in arms. The two have strong defense ties, and that is what China
fears.]{.underline}

[[India also has strong bilateral and strategic ties with Japan,
Australia, and South Korea]{.mark}. So[, if]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark}
chief [thinks he can swoop in and steal New Delhi's thunder]{.mark} in
the Indo Pacific, [he is in for a rude shock.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Biden Weakens Quad

Here's an interesting fact. The NATO chief is not side-lining India on
his own accord. His strings are actually being pulled by an old man from
within the White House. Quad was supposed to be a military alliance
against China. Yet, on the security front, it has not made much progress
ever since Biden took charge of the United States. The Quad has limited
its focus to the economic front.

But that was done strategically. [Biden always wanted to involve NATO in
the Indo-Pacific, minus India in order to deal militarily with
China]{.underline}. The Biden administration does not want to work with
India to counter China. [India is rather ruthless when it comes to
engaging with China]{.underline}. [For somebody who is scared of Xi
Jinping, that factor did not really play well with Biden]{.underline}.

[[Every Quad country except India is being pulled into NATO's security
net in the Indo Pacific]{.mark}. Biden is trying to replace Quad with
NATO. [What Biden does not know is that Japan, Australia, and even South
Korea will refuse to work against China unless India is back on
board.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Quad credibility is key to effective [disaster relief]{.underline}.

Do disaster management agencies in Quad member states communicate and
share information to improve each other's disaster preparedness, and how
effective has this been in reducing damage?

Since 2004, when the current Quad members had first come together as the
Tsunami Core Group, [they have collaborated on a bilateral or a
trilateral basis in disaster management]{.underline}. For example[,
[India and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [signed a
bilateral disaster relief initiative in July 2005]{.mark} to better
integrate their disaster response capabilities]{.underline}. [[India and
Japan signed a memorandum of cooperation in disaster management to
engage in disaster risk reduction]{.underline}]{.mark}. With Australia,
[India collaborates on the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative, where
reducing disaster risk is a major purview]{.underline}. The [United
States and Japan cooperate in the emergency response, and their foreign
development agencies (the U.S. Agency for International Development and
Japan International Cooperation Agency) have worked together on recovery
projects]{.underline}. The United States and Australia have a memorandum
of understanding to strengthen emergency management cooperation in
response to disasters. [Australia and Japan engage in joint exercises
and disaster relief operations through their Reciprocal Access
Agreement. Furthermore, the United States, Japan, and Australia conduct
disaster relief operations through the Trilateral Strategic Dialogue.
These countries also participate in India's Malabar naval exercises,
where HADR is the main component.]{.underline}

Indeed, communication is cardinal in all these collaborations, [as
information sharing is a key aspect of exchanges in disaster
management]{.underline}. Nonetheless, [[as individual entities, each
country has its own disaster management mechanism]{.mark}, and hence
there are bound to be discrepancies in structure, funding, and even
assistance programs. While [the existing cooperative mechanisms may
facilitate the Quad's engagement in disaster management]{.mark}, these
differences would also have to be accommodated]{.underline}. [Success
can only be gauged in terms of the ability of the Quad to effectively
provide coordinated responses in the event of disasters and enhance
preparedness in its member countries]{.underline}. So far, [[apart
from]{.mark} [its recent initiative of supporting Tonga's emergency and
recovery activities]{.mark} following the volcano eruption and tsunami
in January 2022]{.underline}, the only instance of the Quad countries
offering coordinated HADR [was as [the Tsunami Core Group in 2004, which
was a humanitarian as well as diplomatic success.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### That prevents [disease]{.underline} and [environmental collapse]{.underline} and [turns]{.underline} the Alliance Fragmentation advantage. 

**Brattberg, 13**

\[Erik, fellow at the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at
Johns Hopkins University, November 21, 2013, "The case for US military
response during international disasters", The Hill,
<https://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/190954-the-case-for-us-military-response-during-international/>,
accessed 7-15-2022, BB\]

The [scale of the [U.S. military's response to the disastrous Haiyan
Typhoon]{.mark} in the Philippines has been impressive]{.underline}. The
[deployment of USS George Washington along with other smaller vessels
has allowed for the delivery of over 600 tons of relief
supplie]{.underline}s. Moreover, [U.S. military transport has already
[moved thousands of humanitarian workers into the disaster-stricken
Tacloban and airlifted almost 5,000 survivors into
safety.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As [natural disasters and complex humanitarian emergencies are becoming
more common worldwide, the U.S. will increasingly be called in to assist
during other disasters]{.underline}. What's more, [[weak and fragile
states with inadequate emergency response capacities, infrastructure and
public health services are particularly vulnerable to severe natural
disasters]{.underline}]{.mark}. Here, [military response is crucial to
getting relief efforts up and running during the immediate post-disaster
phase.]{.underline}

{mosads}But [[military-led disaster relief is not only a humanitarian
imperative -- it can also serve a larger strategic imperative as a part
of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Compounding the strategic
importance of the US military's role in humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief]{.mark} are four key reasons]{.underline}.

First, and most obviously, [[providing disaster relief helps boost U.S.
soft power]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}. By [assisting in
humanitarian emergencies, the [U.S. military sends a message that it's a
global force for good]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [importance of [this
kind of 'soft-power diplomacy']{.mark}]{.underline} [[cannot be
underestimated]{.mark}, [especially]{.mark} in times [when the US is
perceived as losing influence in the Asia-Pacific region]{.mark} to
China]{.underline}. [[Responding to disasters can also lead to a more
positive attitude towards the U.S]{.mark}. -- as was the case following
U.S. assistance during the flood in Pakistan in 2010.]{.underline}

Second, [[disaster relief can help contain some of the negative
consequences of major disasters from spreading elsewhere in the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is particularly the case [in [weak
states]{.mark} where crises can easily [spill over national boundaries
in the forms of massive refugee flows, the spread of infectious
diseases, or environmental collapse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Case in point:
[[the robust U.S. intervention in Haiti after the earthquake in January
2010 prevented what could otherwise have been huge refugee flows to the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Third, [[disaster relief is also an opportunity for the U.S. military to
forge stronger multilateral security relationships with other countries'
militaries]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the Philippines, [U.S. troops have
worked alongside troops from several other countries.]{.underline} As
the [[U.S. looks to expand its presence in the Asia-Pacific]{.mark} in
the future, [these kinds of activities can serve a clear purpose of
building trust and developing military-to-military
ties]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Pentagon currently winds down its
military presence in Afghanistan, [relief efforts can also provide
essential real-life training opportunities for American
troops.]{.underline} Moreover, [[they can serve to legitimize US
military presence in certain parts of the world where it is currently
disputed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Quad Key To Disaster Response

#### The Quad is key for disaster preparedness and disaster response. 

**Bose, 22**

\[Sohini, Junior Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata
and a Nonresident Fellow at the National Bureau of Asian Research, July
2, 2022, "Quad Cooperation on Disaster Management Prospects for
Revitalizing the Partnership", NBR,
<https://www.nbr.org/publication/quad-cooperation-on-disaster-management-prospects-for-revitalizing-the-partnership/>,
accessed 7-14-2022, BB\]

At its meeting in May, the [[Quad]{.mark} highlighted several previous
focal points of policies and [explored new initiatives, including
frameworks of disaster management]{.mark}]{.underline}. This raises
questions about whether the political will exists for such
intergovernmental cooperation. Arsalan Ahmed spoke with Sohini Bose, a
junior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in Kolkata and a
nonresident fellow at NBR, about her work on natural disaster
management. She discusses how multilateral cooperation through the Quad
to mitigate the threat from natural disasters can be helpful for member
countries as well as the broader Indo-Pacific.

How did the Quad form out of the joint humanitarian assistance and
disaster relief (HADR) operations following the 2004 Indian Ocean
tsunami?

The [[Quad traces its origin to the ad hoc Tsunami Core
Group]{.underline}]{.mark}, [comprising India, the United States,
Australia, and Japan]{.underline}, which was created to deliver a
coordinated response after the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004, [one of the
deadliest disasters in modern history]{.underline}. Unfortunately after
its formation, [the Quad's overtly conventional strategic-security image
made it difficult for the grouping to function sustainably in the face
of Chinese discontent]{.underline}. As a result, [the Quad has begun
exploring other areas of collaboration for its survival]{.underline}.

The [[entire Indian Ocean region is referred to as the "world hazard
belt" due to frequent cyclones, tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, and
droughts]{.underline}]{.mark}. Meanwhile, [the [Ring of Fire]{.mark}
covers much of the rim of the Pacific Ocean, [mak]{.mark}ing [the region
prone to multiple volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, [[natural disaster
management seems to be a prime area of coop]{.mark}eration for these
like-minded Indo-Pacific countries.]{.underline}

In the four phases of disaster management (mitigation, preparedness,
response, and recovery), how can the Quad best serve as an avenue of
regional cooperation?

[Disaster management is operational at four stages, two of which are
particularly relevant for the Quad]{.underline}. These are [disaster
preparedness and disaster response]{.underline}.

With respect to disaster preparedness[, [all the Quad countries have
developed sophisticated systems of dealing with disasters]{.mark}, each
excelling in different ways.]{.underline} For example, [[Japan has an
efficient earthquake early-warning system, while India has a
tsunami-alert system for the Indian Ocean and Australia has the same for
the Pacific Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[United States has also
developed tools for mapping disaster vulnerability]{.mark}. From this,
there is ample space for information sharing, technical knowledge, and
best practices that are worth learning, and bad practices that must be
avoided]{.underline}.

The [Quad can thus engage in developing and coordinating better
early-warning systems and capacity-building initiatives by hosting
workshops and training programs]{.underline}. This would not only
enhance the prowess of its member states but [also benefit those
countries that might seek to partner with the Quad]{.underline}. As the
[fact sheet released by the White House in the buildup to the Quad
Leaders' Summit in Tokyo in May 2022 claimed, Quad partners will convene
technical experts to enhance cooperation for additional disaster
mitigation and HADR workshops]{.underline}. [They will also work
together to improve crisis preparedness and early warning]{.underline}.
In the same manner, the [Quad can host joint disaster management
exercises, which would train the participating countries in delivering
better disaster responses.]{.underline}

[[With regard to disaster response,]{.underline} [each of the member
countries is an internationally recognized provider of
HADR]{.underline}.]{.mark} Hence, [the [Quad can engage in search and
rescue or relief operations]{.mark}]{.underline} in the event of a
disaster. Some hiccups, however, could hinder such initiatives---for
example, [the disparity in HADR funding between countries]{.underline}.
[Australia's reliance on civilian forces and bilateral engagements for
[providing disaster relief might]{.mark} also [make it difficult to
involve a military-oriented approach to disaster
response]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, [[this avenue is worth exploring and may prove effective in
the event of another disaster as calamitous as the 2004
tsunami]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Quad emphasized building links
between response agencies of member states to provide timely and
effective HADR support to the region in its Joint Statement on Quad
Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, released in February 2022.
At the recently concluded May summit, leaders established the Quad
Partnership on HADR in the Indo-Pacific to strengthen their
collaboration and effectively respond to disasters in the region.

#### Vaccine development is key to resolve future pandemics, which will continue to multiply

Timothy **Huzar**, **21**. \[Timothy J. Huzar is an interdisciplinary
scholar whose work explores philosophical issues around politics,
violence, narration, and care. \"Scientists call for 'pan-virus
vaccines' to prevent next pandemic,\" Medical news Today,
https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/scientists-call-for-pan-virus-vaccines-to-prevent-next-pandemic\]//PJ

Pandemics have been increasing over the past 20 years. The swift
development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was in part due to the structure of
the virus. [[Future viruses that could cause pandemics may be]{.mark}
more "[evasion-strong]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Investing in the
development of **[vaccines that can respond to a wide variety of virus
mutations is key to preparedness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, scientists
argue. Scientists from the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, CA,
have published a commentary arguing that governments should invest in
new vaccine technology to help in the fight against future pandemics. In
the article, which appears in the journal Nature, the experts suggest
that vaccines that make use of "broadly neutralizing antibodies" could
target numerous strains of a virus family, such as coronaviruses or
influenza. This could offer comprehensive protection against
particularly dangerous viral strains that may emerge in the future.
Future pandemics The current COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of
the dangers that easily transmissible and potentially deadly viruses
pose to humans[. Scientists note that [pandemics have been increasing
over the last 20 years]{.mark}.]{.underline} Researchers suggest this is
driven in part by land-use change such as deforestation and intensive
farming practices. These can bring wild animals into closer proximity
with humans and livestock, increasing the risk of zoonotic viruses
crossing between species. And until the world's governments respond to
these underlying factors, pandemics will pose a significant risk.
'Evasion-strong' viruses However, in their new commentary, Dr. Dennis R.
Burton and Dr. Eric J. Topol argue that one way of dealing with this
threat is investing in vaccine technologies that can respond to a wide
variety of virus types. They claim this is particularly urgent because
the rapid development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was in part possible due to
the structure of the virus. **[[Future viruses may not be]{.mark} so
[amenable to rapid vaccine development]{.mark} using conventional
technologies]{.underline}**. SARS-CoV-2 has a large attachment site,
through which it replicates itself within the host organism's cells.
This structural quality means it is relatively easy to develop vaccines
that can stick to the virus's attachment site, stopping it from working.
[SARS-[CoV]{.mark}-2 [is]{.mark} in this sense ["evasion-lite," meaning
it does not rely on evading a person's antibodies to proliferate but by
quickly triggering the infection in a person before they have built up
an immunological response. However, **some viruses are more
"evasion-strong."**]{.mark}]{.underline} Dr. Burton and Dr. Topol
highlight HIV, which can stay hidden from a person's immune system for
years and generate a vast number of strains within the body. [[If a
respiratory virus with these properties emerges, it will take **far
longer to develop an effective vaccine**, while the potential **effects
of the virus could be far worse**]{.underline}]{.mark} [if allowed to
develop into a pandemic]{.underline}. New vaccine technology To account
for this, Dr. Burton and Dr. Topol argue there should be investment in
research around "broadly neutralizing antibodies." These antibodies are
able to effectively respond to a variety of strains of the same virus,
not just one particular strain. This means they could be valuable in
responding to new mutations of a dominant virus --- such as SARS-CoV-2
--- as well as potentially offering protection against novel strains of
particular virus families, such as coronaviruses.

#### Future pandemics could cause extinction

review: Eleftherios Phedias Diamandis, is a Greek Cypriot-Canadian
biochemist who specializes in clinical chemistry. He is Professor & Head
of Clinical Biochemistry in the Department of Laboratory Medicine and

Although we are made up of human cells, we have almost ten times that of
bacteria just in our guts and more on our skin. These microbes not only
affect locally but also affect the entire body. [[There is a balance
between]{.mark} the good and bad [bacteria, and]{.mark}]{.underline} any
change in the environment may cause this balance to shift, especially on
the skin, [[the consequences]{.underline}]{.mark} of which [[are
unknown]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Although most bacteria on and inside of us are harmless, gut bacteria
can also have viruses. If viruses don't kill the bacteria immediately,
they can incorporate into the bacterial genome and stay latent for a
long time until reactivation by environmental factors, when they can
become pathogenic. They can also escape from the gut and enter other
organs or the bloodstream. Bacteria can then use these viruses to kill
other bacteria or help them evolve to more virulent strains.

An example of the evolution of pathogens is the cause of the current
pandemic, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2). Several mutations are now known that make the virus more
infectious and resistant to immune responses, and strengthening its to
enter cells via surface receptors.

The brain

There is evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 can also affect the brain. The
virus may enter the brain via the olfactory tract or through the
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) pathway. [[Viruses can]{.mark}
also [affect our senses]{.mark}, such as a loss of smell and taste, [and
there could be]{.mark} other so far unknown [neurological
effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. The loss of smell seen in COVID-19 could
be a new viral syndrome specific to this disease.

Many books and movies have described [[pandemics caused by
pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[wipe out large populations and
cause severe diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the essay, the author
provides a hypothetical scenario where a gut bacteria suddenly starts
producing viral proteins. Some [[virions]{.underline}]{.mark} spread
through the body and [[get transmitted through **the human
population**]{.underline}]{.mark}. After a few months, the virus started
causing blindness, and within a year, large populations lost their
vision.

[[Pandemics can cause other diseases that]{.mark} can **[threaten
humanity's entire existence]{.mark}**. The COVID-19 pandemic brought
this possibility to the forefront. If we continue disturbing the
equilibrium]{.underline} between us and the environment, we don't know
what the consequences may be and [[the next]{.mark} pandemic [could
lead]{.mark} us [to **extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Quad Key To Laundry List

#### Quad is key to avoid a laundry list of extinction scenarios -- its credibility is key

**Oak, 21**

Over the years, the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue ([**[Quad]{.mark}**)
has [expanded its agenda to adapt]{.mark} itself [to]{.mark} [face the
gen-next threats]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific, [most notably]{.mark} the
[emerging technology]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Quad was created as an ad
hoc group to help the Indo-Pacific littoral states in the aftermath of
the Tsunami in 2004. Although the first iteration of the Quad in 2007
was short-lived, [the latest iteration promises that Quad is here to
stay for decades to come]{.underline}. This inference can be reached
based on the expansive agenda that the Quad has drawn for itself, which
looks beyond narrow security calculations in the region. The [first
in-person summit of the **[Quad leaders delved upon not only the
security situation in the Indo-Pacific but also multiple areas,
including the supply of COVID-19 vaccines, climate crisis, terrorism and
emerging technology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By [[making the emerging
technology one of the cornerstones of the grouping]{.mark}, the [Quad
has **shown its resilience to stay relevant in the fast-changing
strategic environment of the Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Therefore, [it is pertinent to look at the evolution of the second
iteration of the Quad and how the minilateral is seamlessly synergising
technology with its original agenda of security.]{.underline}

Evolution of the Quad

Amid the belligerent behaviour of China in the maritime continuum of the
Indo-Pacific and growing trust and comfort between the four democracies1
[, **[the Quad re-emerged on the sidelines of]{.mark}** the 31st
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (**[ASEAN) Summit]{.mark}** and
12th East Asia Summit in Manila,]{.underline} 2017. Four working-level
meetings---November 2017, June 2018, November 2018 and May
2019---involving officials from the foreign ministries of Delhi,
Washington, Tokyo and Canberra focused on "a free, open, prosperous and
inclusive Indo-Pacific region" benefitting all in the region and the
world at large.2 [[They]{.mark} also **[touched upon connectivity,
sustainable development, counter-terrorism, non-proliferation,
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR), cyber security and
ASEAN centrality]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 [The separate statements from
the four capitals also mentioned about the [respect for sovereignty,
equality and territorial integrity of all nations in a transparent,
economically viable and financially responsible
manner.]{.mark}4]{.underline}

In September 2019, the working-level meeting of the Quad was elevated to
the ministerial-level meeting when the United States (US) Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo hosted his counterparts from India, Japan and
Australia in New York. Although the leaders did not issue a joint
statement post meeting, the issues raised were similar to those raised
during the working-level meetings.[5 The first ministerial meeting saw a
limited expansion of the agenda as the Quad countries "conducted a
tabletop counter-terrorism exercise in November 2019 and convened a
meeting of cyber experts the following month".]{.underline}6 As COVID-19
gripped the world in early 2020, the senior officials' consultation of
the four countries ["underscored the importance of enhancing the
resilience of supply chains]{.underline}" and [[**added pandemic** **and
best practices** to deal with the same in the agenda of the
meeting]{.underline}]{.mark}.7 The [second ministerial meeting of the
Quad in Tokyo, held in October 2020, discussed "[post COVID-19
**international order**" and issues related to "**the resilience of
supply chains**" in addition to the maritime security issues of the
Indo-Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### They Say: "NATO Deficit/NATO Good"

#### CP solves and guarantees follow on --- Quad is key to innovation cooperation and countering China --- and Quad gets [other countries]{.underline} involved -- especially authoritarian countries

The [joint statement following the Quad leaders' virtual summit in March
2021 mentioned "critical technologies" three times]{.underline}. The
[[leaders resolved]{.mark} that the [Quad "will begin cooperation on the
critical technologies of the future to ensure that innovation is
consistent with a free, open, inclusive, and resilient
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}"]{.underline}.11 The minilateral group also
launched ["a critical- and emerging-technology working group [to
facilitate cooperation on international standards and innovative
technologies of the future]{.mark}".]{.underline}12 [Building on the
spirit of technological cooperation, the Quad took a holistic view of
the emerging technologies and associated issues]{.underline}. In the
realm of 5G mobile networks[, the Quad]{.underline}, during the
first-ever in-person summit in September 2021, [decided to deploy
"secure, open, and transparent 5G and beyond-5G networks" from
trustworthy vendors. The statement exuded confidence about coming up
with the "open, standards-based 5G technology". Individually, the Quad
countries devised formal and informal policies to deny entry to
untrustworthy telecom vendors]{.underline}.13 [The [leaders]{.mark} also
[announced sector-specific contact groups to develop technical standards
for emerging technologies]{.mark}. [They launched the Quad Principles on
Technology Design, Development, Governance, and Use]{.mark} with the
purpose of "[guiding not only the region but the world towards
responsible, open, high-standards innovation]{.mark}".14]{.underline}

[[Sensing]{.mark} the [vulnerabilities in the supply
chains]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[Quad leaders]{.mark} decided "to map
the supply chain of the critical technologies and
materials]{.underline}"15 and diversify the same. [Further, India, Japan
and Australia [launched]{.mark} Supply Chain Resilience Initiative
([SCRI) to counter Chinese dominance of the supply chains in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 The [need to diversify the supply chains
away from China was felt intensely in the light of deteriorating
relations between China and members of Quad]{.underline}. As Amitendu
Palit has argued, [[the repositioning of strategic supply
chains]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially in the field of semiconductors
and telecommunications, [[was part of a broader strategy to decouple
from China]{.mark} and "to develop a coalition of like-minded countries
for taking on an assertive China in the Indo-Pacific".]{.underline}17
[In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, the [Quad countries are
working with other like-minded countries for an initiative titled
"Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence]{.mark}"]{.underline}18
under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) that promotes inclusive and responsible use of
Artificial Intelligence.

Domestically, India is taking baby steps to shape the rules and norms
vis-à-vis emerging technologies such as 5G and Artificial Intelligence
on international platforms. The country is debating the issues related
to data sovereignty vigorously. It has also come up with an Approach
Document on Artificial Intelligence.19 Bilaterally, [India is
collaborating with like-minded countries in the field of emerging
technologies. India and Japan signed a Memorandum of Understanding in
January 2021, to enhance cooperation in Information and Communications
Technologies]{.underline}, covering 5G technologies, telecom security,
submarine optical fibre cable system to islands of India, and spectrum
management, among others.20 Similarly, India and Australia have set up
the India--Australia Joint Working Group on Cyber Security
Cooperation.21 The two countries have also signed the Memorandum of
Understanding on critical minerals.22 [[India is]{.mark} also
[cooperating with ASEAN for capacity building]{.mark} and knowledge
sharing in the areas of Internet of Things (IoT) and 5G,]{.underline}
among others, to achieve the ASEAN Digital Masterplan 2025 (ADM2025).23
[Separately, India and the US have resolved to "[revive the]{.mark} High
Technology Cooperation Group ([HTCG) in early 2022, to accelerate high
technology commerce in key areas]{.mark}".24 In October 2020, India
joined Japan and Five Eyes Alliance countries to demand access to
end-to-end encrypted communication from big tech
companies.25]{.underline}

Thus, in addition to its existing agenda of securing free and open
Indo-Pacific, [the [Quad is fast embracing the emerging technology as a
critical area to build upon]{.mark}]{.underline}. By [spindling around
the emerging technologies, the Quad is successfully expanding
horizontally.]{.underline} Similarly, [[with the initiatives such as the
Quad plus]{.underline}]{.mark}---[which [included the foreign
secretary-level meeting of New Zealand, Vietnam, South Korea and the
foreign ministers-level meeting of Brazil, South Korea, Israel]{.mark}
to discuss COVID-19---[the Quad is stretching
laterally]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As [authoritarian societies are better
equipped to extract data from their citizens than free
societies]{.mark}26 , the [Quad is trying to offer an alternative model
different from the coercive vision of the authoritarian states in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}. With the emerging technology
intruding into our daily lives and changing how nations create power and
wield it against one another27 , [the Quad is proving to be a prudent
minilateral to cope with the technological churn in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}

#### Its momentum is accelerating and it's expanding -- guarantees Asian support

Despite the protests from China, [the [momentum behind the Quad is
accelerating]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Cooperation has increased]{.mark},
and [there are talks surrounding the expansion of this arrangement to
include other regional powers]{.mark}]{.underline}. What does such
cooperation mean for the United States and its defense industrial base?

Following the recent Quad meeting, the [[White House]{.mark} [released a
statement addressing]{.mark} key areas of future [cooperation.]{.mark}
"Critical [and Emerging Technologies]{.mark}" were specifically
highlighted and the following topics were addressed.]{.underline}

It was announced that the "[[Quad will cooperate on technical exchanges
and testbed activity to advance interoperability and telecommunications
cybersecurity]{.mark}."]{.underline} Furthermore, [the Quad members
[launched a "consortium of investors that seeks to advance access to
capital for critical and emerging technologies within and across the
Quad]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Finally, the member nations launched a "Quad Cybersecurity Partnership"
that will "aim to prevent cyber incidents, prepare national and
international capabilities for potential cyber incidents, and/or respond
quickly and effectively to a cyber incident, when or should one occur."

#### Turns case --- India's membership is key to counter China without militarizing the Quad -- and CP is key to amend internal struggles between France and other NATO countries among other impacts

**Trivedi, 21**

\[Atman, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's South Asia
Center and has over twenty years of foreign policy and trade experience
with expertise in India and the broader Asia region, "A reinvigorated
Quad is becoming a key element of the new US administration's Asia
policy---just not in the way you expected.", Atlantic Council,

[[A reinvigorated Quad is becoming a key element of the new US
administration's Asia policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its
members---Australia, India, Japan, and the US---convened virtually in
March at the leader level. Amid multiple global crises, [they wisely
opted to focus on concrete ways to deliver for their people and the
region]{.underline}. The grouping sought to prove that democracy still
works, as President Biden likes to say. The Quad Leaders' communique set
the bar high: cooperation on "the defining challenges of our time."

Largely across US party lines, [the [consensus is building that China's
economic and military aggression]{.mark} ranks high among
[defin]{.mark}ing [global challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But rather
than construct an anti-China military alliance]{.mark}, the [Quad has so
far opted for a pragmatic and unifying focus on urgent global
problems]{.mark}.]{.underline} That [decision in part [acknowledges
India's reluctance to antagonize China]{.mark}, especially while their
border dispute remains unresolved]{.underline}. The smaller ASEAN
countries and, to a lesser extent, even linchpin US ally South Korea,
are wary of being jostled about by major power competition. More
fundamentally, [the [region wants to tackle pressing issues like the
pandemic and climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Hopes were high]{.mark} in the early spring that the Quad's ambitious
plan [for India to manufacture one billion
vaccines]{.mark},]{.underline} with financial and logistical assistance
from the others, could help bring the COVID-19 pandemic to a swift
conclusion. Southeast Asia was to be a primary beneficiary. But [[that
was before a catastrophic second wave struck India]{.mark}, and the
delta variant laid siege to unvaccinated Americans. The in-person Quad
Leaders summit should clarify where the promising vaccine partnership
stands]{.underline}.

[The [coalition also identified climate change as a top priority]{.mark}
back in March.]{.underline} Since then, [the [countries appear to have
stepped-up their cooperation in the last few months]{.mark}. For
instance, Special Envoy John [Kerry launched a new climate financing
mechanism while in India last week]{.mark}. With COP26 mere weeks away
and faith in global efforts wavering, the [Quad countries]{.mark} need
to [demonstrate their firm commitment to cleaner technologies and
support for emissions reduction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[partners]{.mark} will [also discuss progress related to critical
and emerging technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}---[now a significant
dimension of preserving free and open societies. They will exchange
views on [reducing escalating tensions over the Taiwan Strait and
addressing the tragedy unfolding in Myanmar]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While
defense ties are not the leading edge of the Quad, the [leaders may not
pass up the opportunity for discrete conversation about Western Pacific
and Indian Ocean security]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The [US and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban's
reemergence elevates longstanding security concerns for
India]{.underline}, in particular. [[New Delhi's dodgy neighborhood
has]{.mark} undoubtedly [grown more dangerous]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[India-focused terrorist groups are likely emboldened by the return of
an especially strict variant of political Islam to
Afghanistan]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the past, [the Taliban [provided a
playground for violent extremists targeting India and the
West]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[growing imperative for India to secure
continental borders]{.mark} could distract from Asian maritime
activities, [unless likeminded friends can help it manage the increasing
risk of terrorism.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [Quad Leaders will be meeting right after the big reveal of
AUKUS,]{.underline} a new Indo-Pacific coalition launched by Australia,
the United Kingdom, and the United States. AUKUS should complement the
Quad's early focus on non-military issues. Unlike it, the newcomer will
be focused squarely on defense, related science, and technology
cooperation. This [emphasis reflects Washington's serious determination
to work with allies to create a favorable balance of power to deter
China]{.underline}. Europe also remains critical to this project[. [It
is worth exploring whether India or Japan can use growing Indo-Pacific
cooperation with France to help smooth over Paris's recent public
disagreement with Canberra, Washington, and London]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [essential point remains this: In the past 18 months, China has
resorted to economic coercion against Australia and Europe, military
coercion against India, and elevated regional anxiety levels through
heightened sovereignty claims, often far from established
borders]{.underline}. [To the extent AUKUS can induce greater caution
and restraint from China around its periphery, that should be a welcomed
development for India, the Quad, and the region.]{.underline}

The [[Quad and likeminded democracies are all eagerly exploring
overlapping security arrangements in response to a shifting power
balance]{.underline}.]{.mark} While they do so, [[it is vital that these
liberal societies take the necessary steps to secure democratic
institutions against the polarizing forces of nationalism, populism, and
xenophobia]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Distracted or divided democracies
often have a way of letting domestic politics seep into foreign
policymaking, which can lead to national interests being defined more
narrowly to the detriment of international partners]{.underline}.

### They Say: "CP Doesn't Solve Quad Credibility"

#### The counterplan is vital to strengthen the Quad --- emerging technology cooperation is key.

cooperation]{.mark} [between the U.S. and]{.mark} its Indo-Pacific
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Whether it be info]{.mark}rmation

## Trilateral Israel-India-U.S. CP

### 1NC --- Trilateral Israel-India-U.S. CP

#### Next off is the [Trilateral Israel-India-U.S. Counterplan]{.underline}.

#### The United States federal government should establish a trilateral defense innovation partnership with the Republic of India and the State of Israel focused on artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and cybersecurity, including by establishing formal cooperation between India's Innovations for Defence Excellence, Israel's Directorate of Defense Research and Development, and the U.S.'s Defense Innovation Unit, creating a startup corridor by conjoining their nation's innovation hubs, establishing a seed fund with a substantial multi-year funding commitment, and expanding academic collaboration.

Sept. 3 [signed an agreement to co-develop air-launched unmanned aerial
vehicles as part of]{.underline} the Defense Technology and Trade
Initiative, [a bilateral cooperation mechanism for defense trade and
joint tech]{.underline}nology [development. Under the agreement, the
U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory will collaborate with India's Defence
Research and Development Organisation and air force for "design,
development, demonstration, testing and evaluation of systems" to
co-develop the UAV prototype.]{.underline}

[Capitalizing on this agreement]{.underline} on air-launched UAVs, [[the

communities**]{.mark} in Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv and Bengaluru, [it
will be a **crucial step** in materializing **a new kind of trilateral

The underlying assumption behind this potential collaboration is this:
[with the **breakneck speed** of advancements in emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies [like robotics, a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence [and quantum computing, **solo national
efforts** in developing and adopting them **won't go far**.]{.underline}

the "Framework for the U.S.-India Defense Relationship," a bilateral
defense pact]{.underline}. Under this agreement, they explored basic
technologies in the beginning, termed as "pathfinder projects." The
intent was to harness America's advanced defense industrial base to
India's desire to achieve self-reliance in defense technology through
the "Make in India" campaign.

[But despite their synergies]{.underline}, [both countries were unable
to make good on this collaboration as they discussed and explored many
projects in the next few years]{.underline}, [only to abandon them
later.]{.underline} Some of the initial projects included the RQ-11B
Raven unmanned aerial system, mobile electric hybrid power sources and a
digital helmet mounted display system.

[Therefore]{.underline}, [the present agreement on air-launched UAVs is
**significant** as it marks the first time that both countries appear to
have made progress beyond initial deliberations. It **leverages** the
U.S. and Indian governments' **defense research establishments** to
deliver the next-generation combat capability.]{.underline}

**[[Leveraging]{.mark} this [progress in bilateral defense
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology [**[coop]{.mark}eration**, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and India must look at ways to
**achieve more** from their partnership.]{.underline}

[One way to do this [is by shaping **trilateral
coop**]{.mark}**eration** [involving Israel]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[with a focus on emerging
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies[**[.]{.mark}** Such a partnership
would build on Israel's robust bilateral military ties with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and India. U.S.-Israel defense
cooperation already has a strong r]{.underline}esearch [and
d]{.underline}evelopment [component to innovate capabilities ranging
from missile defense to anti-tunnelling systems.]{.underline} Likewise,
[India and Israel have carved out a solid defense trade and R&D
partnership including the development and operationalization of the
Barak-8 air-and-missile defense system.]{.underline}

[U.S.-India-Israel [trilateral coop]{.mark}eration on emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies [[will **capitalize** and **expand
on**]{.mark} these existing bilateral [synergies. A focus on
**startups** and the **deep defense innovation**]{.mark} in Israel and
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[offers a **clear
pathway**]{.mark} to initiate and nurture this cooperation.]{.underline}

[The Pentagon has tapped into Silicon Valley's innovations by setting up
the **D**]{.underline}efense **[I]{.underline}**nnovation
**[U]{.underline}**nit[. It works closely with the **tech industry and
startups** to shortlist, fund and develop emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies [including AI, autonomous systems and
cyber.]{.underline}

[Israel]{.underline} too [has created a **thriving defense innovation
base** centered in Tel Aviv. This has made Israel a technologically
advanced military power and earned it the "**startup nation**"
nickname.]{.underline}

[India is following the lead set by Israel and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [in tapping startups for defense innovation. Under
a new flagship initiative called the]{.underline} "Innovations for
Defence Excellence" ([iDEX]{.underline}) [program, India is asking its
domestic startup ecosystem]{.underline}, [particularly in
Bengaluru]{.underline}, [to arm the Indian military with
tech]{.underline}nologies [like soldier protection systems, secure
hardware encryption devices, unmanned surface and underwater vehicles,
and AI-based satellite image analysis, among others. This is also
bringing **commercial participation from the U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [as many Indian startups have investments from
Silicon Valley venture funds]{.underline} like Artiman Ventures (Tonbo),
Accel and IDG Partners (Axio Biosolutions) and WRVI Capital
(ideaForge)[.]{.underline}

[[There is an opportunity to take]{.mark} this [**one giant step
forward** by creating a **startup corridor** that **conjoins the three
innovation hubs**]{.mark} of Silicon Valley, Tel Aviv and
Bengaluru.]{.underline}

[This corridor can potentially cover emerging tech]{.underline}nologies
[like quantum science, AI, drones, blockchain, autonomy and robotics,
5G/6G, additive manufacturing, and advanced battery
tech]{.underline}nology [and power sources.]{.underline}

[For many of these tech]{.underline}nologies, [Israel and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have **already** reached an
**advanced stage** of **research** and **cooperation**]{.underline},
[compared to India]{.underline} [which is still discussing the
implications of some tech]{.underline}nologies [like AI and quantum
computing]{.underline}, [and expanding its tech]{.underline}nological
[capabilities in others such as robotics. Their acquisition will
**augment options** for the Indian and American militaries in dealing
with an aggressive China.]{.underline}

[[Beijing]{.mark} has anchored its flagship national
policies]{.underline} such as "Made in China 2025" [on these strategic
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline} Beijing perceives them as
multi-use, thereby blurring the distinction between civil and military
applications. [It [has]{.mark} also [joined]{.mark} hands [with Moscow
to develop new tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[. As a
result]{.underline}, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, with
the largest spending on defense R&D among the democratic states, [no
longer enjoys the absolute tech]{.underline}nological [lead it earlier
had.]{.underline}

[China's determined pursuit of tech supremacy coincides with its
confrontationist attitude against neighbors and
adversaries]{.underline}, as seen most recently in the border standoff
with India in the Himalayas and escalated violations of Taiwan's Air
Defense Identification Zone. [[These]{.mark} developments [make it
**imperative** for the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to **bolster its**]{.mark} **existing
[R&D]{.mark} activities** in emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [[by
**enlisting**]{.mark} **allies** like [**India** and
**Israel**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The idea of trilateral cooperation is not new. In recent years, Indian
American diaspora associations and Jewish American associations in the
United States have repeatedly argued for creating a technology triangle
between the three countries. Even the governments have tried their hand.
In September 2020, Bonnie Glick, then-deputy administrator of the U.S.
Agency for International Development, mentioned that the three countries
had explored initial cooperation in 5G communication technology.

Against this backdrop, [[the three]{.mark} countries [can
initiate]{.mark} discussions for a **[formal collaboration]{.mark}**
between India's iDEX, Israel's D]{.underline}irectorate of
[D]{.underline}efense [R]{.underline}esearch and
[D]{.underline}evelopment [and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [DIU. [They can]{.mark} then [institute **flagship
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [**[programs]{.mark}** to develop
use-case scenarios.]{.underline} Alternatively, they can establish a
joint group to identify and monitor emerging technologies, before
deciding to collaborate.

[To enable partnerships between these defense innovation
ecosystems]{.underline}, [[the three]{.mark} countries [can create a
**seed fund**]{.mark} that offers initial funding to the startups'
ideas]{.underline}, [even before they reach the tech]{.underline}nology
[demonstration/prototype stage. The seed fund may take the form of [a
**multi-year commitment**]{.mark} from the three countries. An
additional layer will be an **[academic collaboration]{.mark}** among
the nations' premier tech institutions.]{.underline}

Another way to forge collaboration between startups is to hold
hackathons where teams representing the countries will work on problem
statements identified by their militaries. There is a precedent for
this. In 2008, the Indian and U.S. armies held an event called MAV08 in
India to develop feasible micro air vehicles technology.

[Steps such as these [will **facilitate collaboration on defense
innovation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The idea is not without its challenges. One principal obstacle is Israel
and India's defense relations with other countries. Among these are
India's Cold War-origin defense ties with Russia. India has veered away
from Russia in the last decade, with Israel and the United States
becoming principal weapons suppliers.

However, New Delhi continues to purchase major equipment from Moscow,
like the S-400 long-range surface-to-air missile system. This purchase
has caused considerable irritation in India-U.S. ties. India has
explained the rationale of acquiring this system to the U.S. government,
but Washington has clarified that New Delhi is not guaranteed to get a
waiver under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act,
which imposes sanctions against countries that engage in significant
transactions with the Russian security establishment. This issue is
expected to generate friction as the delivery of the S-400 is scheduled
to begin by the end of 2021.

Meanwhile, Israel's defense ties with China and Pakistan can be
problematic for trilateral cooperation. Israeli arms sales to China
began in the 1980s and flourished over the years. But by the late 1990s,
the United States, concerned by Chinese military modernization, began
vetoing these sales including a highly lucrative deal involving the
Phalcon airborne early warning radar system.

In 2005, the U.S. showed its resentment by imposing sanctions on Israel
over the latter's reported sales of Harpy drones to China. There have
been no additional sales to Beijing since then, but Israeli media has
reported instances of unofficial and illegal sales to China. It has also
reported similar sales to Pakistan, despite the absence of formal
diplomatic relations between the two countries.

These defense ties with other countries, overlooking the partners'
security interests, may complicate a potential trilateral teaming.
However, a frank dialogue addressing these differences and developing a
shared understanding of the threat environment can certainly enhance
compatibility.

[Rapid tech]{.underline}nological [advancements today will ensure that
those nations which harness and adapt them will be ahead of their
competitors. Hence]{.underline}, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates[, [India and Israel need to **join hands**
to **expand their advantage**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The logic of
undertaking such an effort becomes even more apparent in the face of the
challenge of a once-in-a-century pandemic of COVID-19, which has
strained economies and resource mobilization and distracted many
countries from their strategic goals.

[This trilateral partnership]{.underline}, therefore, [holds promise for
overcoming these trying times.]{.underline}

#### The counterplan [alone]{.underline} is key to strengthen trilateral relations --- the [signal]{.underline} of deeper U.S. support is key.

Time for a Trilateral

[The **growing strategic convergence** between Washington and Delhi
suggests an]{.underline}other [initiative that could help
advance]{.underline} the administration's notion of [shared
responsibility. [Few steps **signal shifting strategic intentions** more
than multilateral dialogues.]{.mark} They presage evolving networks of
relationships---particularly when the talks span multiple strategic
regions.]{.underline} In that respect, [[a trilateral dialogue]{.mark}
among India, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Israel
[would **draw**]{.mark} **the [attention]{.mark}** [from friends and
competitors]{.mark} alike.]{.underline}

[[U.S. participation]{.mark} in this dialogue [would demonstrate]{.mark}
that [the White House is thinking of the]{.mark} long [bridge that spans
vital U.S. interests]{.mark} and protection of the commons [across
the]{.mark} expanse of the [Indian Ocean. It would]{.mark} also
**[reassure]{.mark}** the other [participants Washington sees them as
**valued global strategic partners**---**not just regional
allies**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Here are]{.underline} five natural [issues where high-level
consultation among these like-minded nations could prove highly
productive.]{.underline}

Getting Serious About Cyber.

[[Cyber will]{.mark} unquestionably [be a cornerstone]{.mark} of the
U.S.-India strategic relationship. There are exciting opportunities for
both countries. Already a small-cyber power punching above its weight,
Israel fits in nicely between the interests and capabilities of the
other two countries.]{.underline}

Pondering One Belt One Road.

Hard thinking about the opportunities and challenges posed by China's
initiative ought to be paired with a discussion of what role the United
States should play in making its economic presence felt across the
expanse of the Indian Ocean. China's biggest tool these days is the
checkbook. What is Washington going to bring to the table, where and
why? Learning the perspectives of nations from different parts of the
commons linking East and West can help the United States develop the
right answers to these questions.

Countering Islamist Threats.

From terrorist attacks to Islamist ideology, the United States, Israel
and India have the same problem---stopping terrorist murderers,
dangerous ideologues and building common cause with the breath of the
Islamic world that rejects the violence and extremism that affects them
worst of all. Few topics merit joint discussions and action more.

Seeing the Sea.

Situational awareness in the maritime domain is a priority for all the
three countries. These are topics where sharing ideas make sense.

Defending the Free World.

[U.S.-Indian **[defense cooperation]{.mark}** is the face of the
future.]{.underline} F-16 production in India is one big idea on the
table. There are many more. [With global supply chains for major defense
equipment that might well include suppliers and manufactures across
multi-tiers in all three countries, discussing the possibilities
together at one table [might spark]{.mark} some
[innovations.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Start at the Start

[A trilateral dialogue might profitably address a long list of
topics]{.underline}, [from energy to a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[.]{.underline} The five ideas presented above
are a logical place to start. [[All that's needed is the **will** to get
a **high-level dialogue** going]{.mark}---a dialogue [that can move the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[to **the
next level of global diplomacy**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### That solves [the case]{.underline} and a [long list]{.underline} of [catastrophic risks]{.underline} including [terrorism]{.underline}, [global authoritarianism]{.underline}, the [LIO]{.underline}, [climate change]{.underline}, [water scarcity]{.underline}, [agriculture]{.underline}, [space]{.underline}, [energy]{.underline}, and [hybrid war]{.underline}.

Introduction

[India, Israel and the US have robust democratic systems and
share]{.underline}s [common values]{.underline}, [on which their
continual cooperation hinges. There was **constant upscaling** of
**bilateral** relations between India-US, India-Israel and US-Israel in
the past decades.]{.underline} The three countries conducted a
trilateral virtual summit in 2020 to discuss trilateral partnerships in
technology, strategic affairs and development. They are currently
cooperating to develop an open, reliable and safe to use next-gen 5G
technology.

[**However**, the three countries are yet to utilise their **full
potential** for a **strong and sustainable trilateral partnership** in
many areas. A **broader** and **close-knit defence cooperation network**
between these democracies is the need of the hour.]{.underline} This
Briefing Paper looks into the trilateral cooperation between the three
countries and the potential areas to collaborate trilaterally.

Background

India, Israel and the US have robust democratic systems and shares
common values, on which their continual cooperation hinges. The three
also boast of big free-market economies and thus, bilateral trade
between each of the countries has been significant since India opened up
its economy in the 1990s.

Since the last few decades, bilateral trade and cooperation between
Israel and India have scaled new heights. Apart from actively
cooperating in agriculture and academics, India has become the largest
importer of Israeli defence equipment. Israel has aligned itself with
the Make in India initiative programme and has set up bilateral sub-
working groups on Artificial Intelligence (AI), innovation, and
technology transfer.

On a similar note, India-US relations are at an all-time high, spanning
multiple areas of bilateral cooperation. Recent developments between
these countries include the US conferring India with the title of a
Major Defence Partner in 2016, India receiving Strategic Trade
Authorization-1 Status in 2018,i and co-development through the Defence
Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) mechanism since 2012. India and
the US have also deepened cooperation in information sharing,
interoperability and maritime cooperation.

Likewise, being the first country to recognise the statehood of Israel
in 1948 and Jerusalem as the capital of Israel in 2017, the US has
developed a strong bilateral relationship with Israel. The strategic
partnership between the US and Israel has been booming for decades and
successfully established a thriving defence technology corridor.

[Overall]{.underline}, [the three nations have robust bilateral
cooperation mechanisms in various areas]{.underline}, [including defence
and tech]{.underline}nology[. In addition to developing robust bilateral
ties, there has been progress in achieving trilateral cooperation in
recent years]{.underline}.\[end page 1\]

The three countries conducted a trilateral virtual summit in September
2020 to discuss partnerships in technology, strategic affairs and
development. During the summit, it was decided that the three countries
will cooperate in developing open, reliable and safe to use
next-generation 5G technology.

[However, the three countries are yet to utilise the **full potential**
for a **strong and sustainable trilateral partnership** in many areas.
The current times dictate the need for [a **broader and close-knit
defence coop**]{.mark}**eration [network]{.mark}** between these
democracies. The three countries share common interests in the Indian
Ocean region. The trilateral cooperation of the three [is vital in
**countering any threat**]{.mark} **to their common interests [by any
regional powers]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Apart from that]{.underline}, [[the]{.mark} three [countries face
threats of]{.mark} **Islamic [terrorism]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
**[rising authoritarianism]{.mark}** in Asia, Africa, Latin America, the
Middle East and Europe. [A trilateral]{.mark} strategic
[agreement]{.mark} on information and intelligence sharing between the
three countries [can be helpful in **coping with these
challenges**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

India and the US are already cooperating in trilateral initiatives in
African and Asian countries for global development on clean energy,
regional connectivity and disaster risk reduction. The US and Israel
have trilateral partnerships with countries such as Jordan. An
India-Israel-UAE trilateral partnership is also in the works.

[As countries believing in a **rules-based international order** where
all the countries develop and share the benefits of development
equitably, India, Israel, and the US have a responsibility to solve the
world\'s **developmental challenges** with transparent and open
activities. Therefore]{.underline}, [the three democracies should
**strengthen their resolve to cooperate trilaterally**.]{.underline}

Prospects of Trilateral Relationship

[It is essential to highlight that trilateral collaboration via
**start-ups** in Tel Aviv, Bangalore, and Silicon Valley will be highly
beneficial to circumvent the current lengthy defence equipment
acquisition process.]{.underline} Furthermore, it will provide an
opportunity for fledgling Indian, Israeli and American start-ups to
market their emerging technologies through a non-bureaucratic mode and
earn both profits and expertise.

Additionally, innovations in emerging and hybrid technologies can be
utilised for other non-defence and non-military purposes. [To achieve a
long-lasting partnership, a strategic path has to be followed by the
three nations]{.underline}, [starting with the initiation of a formal
dialogue]{.underline} between the DIU, iDEX and Maf'at [to identify
potential areas of research collaboration.]{.underline}

**\[\*\*\* Text Box Starts Here \*\*\*\]**

Lohia Aerospace Systems

Lohia Aerospace Systems is a key private defence sector player in India,
which combines Israeli and Indian defence technology. The group acquired
Israel-based Light & Strong Ltd, Israel's largest private producer of
aerospace focused carbon fibre composite components for Israel's
Aerospace and Defence industry. They leverage the Israeli know-how in
military technology manufacturing and bring high-end technologies in the
defence composites domain to India.

**\[\*\*\* Text Box Ends Here \*\*\*\]**

Next, [[the]{.mark} three [militaries should aim
**interoperability**]{.mark} to understand each other's force
structure]{.underline}, preferably [[through]{.mark} joint
exercises.]{.underline} Most importantly, [[a **joint start-up defence
tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [**[corridor]{.mark}** can be set up
in Tel Aviv, Bangalore and Silicon Valley [to **ramp up R&D** into
**hybrid warfare**]{.mark} **techniques**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Any such trilateral cooperation is set to encounter political
obstruction. To counter this, steady steps such as India inviting Israel
to the G-20 Summit in 2023, and US designating India as a major non-NATO
ally need to be implemented. This is easier said than done. But the
three nations should utilise this minuscule head start to accelerate
growth in hybrid defence technologies.

In short, [[this trilateral]{.mark} partnership between the **[defence
powerhouse]{.mark}s** [can be a **strong bulwark** against]{.mark} the
development of sophisticated tech]{.underline}nologies [in
[**authoritarian countries**.]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end page 2\]

With Israel and the US showing keen interest in India's Make in India
initiative, the loosening of domestic FDI restrictions, and increasing
the ease of doing business, potent defence entrepreneurial trilateral
bases can be set up in the start-up cities of the three countries.

The Covid-19 crisis and burgeoning aggression by the authoritarian
states have heightened the aspiration for faster innovation and better,
high-tech solutions to health, security, and environmental concerns.

Challenges to Trilateral Partnership

Trilateral cooperation has been discussed for quite some years, but
there are a few apparent challenges in the conceptualisation of this
partnership. Firstly, India retains some of its defence cooperation
deals with Russia (former the Soviet Union) and has recently ordered the
Russian S-400 missile defence system.

Considering that the US sanctions any country buying weapons from its
erstwhile Cold War adversary through the Countering America\'s
Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), India could be sanctioned
too. Furthermore, Israel has defence ties with adversaries of India and
the US, which could displease them. The US sanctioned Israel after it
supplied Harpy Drones to China in 2005.

Nevertheless, other challenges like strict FDI regulations and tax
burdens have been relaxed under the Defence Production and Export
Promotion Policy (DPEPP). Additionally, under the Defence Acquisition
Procedure (DAP) 2020, two kinds of lease agreements - - foreign and
Indian \-- have been devised to smoothen and shorten the foreign defence
acquisition process.

Moreover, the DPEPP has eased the burden on start-ups and MSMEs by
establishing the Defence Investor Cell (DIC) as an intermediary between
them and the central, state and other authorities.ii

Additionally, the sudden departure of former PM Benjamin Netanyahu and
the arrival of his political rival Naftali Bennet in Israeli politics
might have implications over Israel's relationship, both with the Biden
government in the US and the Modi government in India.

While Trump, Netanyahu, and Modi shared a rapport conducive to greater
integration between the three nations, it remains to be seen whether
Biden will maintain interest in a trilateral partnership with Bennett at
the helm.

Even before the pandemic, the US-Israel and US- India security and trade
architecture was fairly robust and integrated. The weak link in a
possible trilateral partnership is undoubtedly India-Israel. While in
the recent UN vote on Palestine, India's decision to abstain sent a
message of fluctuation.

It was necessary to convey that India would not move against Israeli
interests on the international stage. Nevertheless, India's soft stance
on the Palestinian issue might not bode well with the far-right Israeli
PM and the effects of this need to be closely monitored.

**[Potential Areas of Trilateral Collaboration]{.underline}**

a\) **[Defence Tech]{.underline}**nology

[The private defence manufacturers and start-ups in the three countries
can collaborate for defence innovation.]{.underline} Partnering with the
technical hub of the US \-- the Silicon Valley - by recruiting directly
from the valley and co-locating, the US Department of Defence's DIU
(Defence Innovation Unit) was able to produce a submarine-launched
unmanned aerial system in eight months, avoiding the lengthy
bureaucratic process of the Defence Department.iii

Taking inspiration from this success, India launched its own iDEX
programme to achieve collaboration with start-ups, academia and R&D
institutes to identify and implement new technologies. Israel has a
superior defence innovation industry centred around Tel Aviv. They
possess a close-knit network of military, academia, defence industry,
start-ups and investors synchronised through the Ministry of Defence's
Directorate of Defence Research & Development (Maf'at).iv

Currently, a strong defence industrial base exists in Bangalore and
Hyderabad where Israeli \[end page 3\] and American firms collaborate
with the local defense and aerospace start-ups.

The recent corporatisation of the Indian ordnance factory boards
provides ample opportunities for the private sector in the US and Israel
to collaborate with the newly created Defence Public Sector Undertakings
(DPSUs) in innovation and production of modern equipment and weapons.

[The three countries should collaborate on emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies, which utilise Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and blockchain technology, that can be used for cyber defence and
resilient communications and a defence Internet of Things.

b\) **[Health]{.underline}**

Even before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Israel and India
cooperated strongly in healthcare and worked together on augmenting the
quality of healthcare infrastructure.

The advent of pandemic has further strengthened the resolve to
cooperate, as both nations have suffered heavy casualties. This resulted
in India and Israel signing an agreement to cooperate in healthcare and
medicine on December 21, 2020.

Furthermore, there is extensive scope for further collaboration in the
field of healthcare. Israel has developed technologically superior
emergency healthcare infrastructure (ambulance riding emergency
responders) and entrepreneur Avi Jorisch has promised that "it is

c\) [**Digital Leadership** and **Innovation**]{.underline} (5G and
onwards)

In the recent virtual trilateral summit between the three countries, a
trilateral partnership in the areas of digital leadership and innovation
was announced. The collaboration would focus on "delivering the next
generation 5G technology in a way that is 'open, interoperable, reliable
and secure'"vi.

This trilateral cooperation in 5G-technology is a good start and would
help challenge the dominance of some authoritarian countries in the
realm of critical technologies. The cooperation should expand to other
digital space areas, such as creating a joint defense system against
cyber threats and hacking of critical supply chains.

The three countries can jointly explore the opportunities in the digital
economy space by focussing on the next-generation technologies such as
the blockchain technology. Collaboration in the areas of
technology-enabled innovations such as renewable energy, electric
vehicles, advanced robotics, and augmented and virtual reality will be
significant in the changing global context.

d\) [[Cooperation]{.mark} in Dealing with **Climate Change** and **Water
Scarcity**]{.underline}

[India, Israel, and the US [can]{.mark} collaborate to [develop
innovative solutions to]{.mark} tackle [**climate change** and]{.mark}
deal with [**water scarcity**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In Bangalore's Tech
Summit-2020, entrepreneur Avi Jorisch from Israel expressed hope that
Israel and India would produce sustainable energy.

He pointed out Israel's extraordinary achievement of becoming water
self-sufficient despite having 60 per cent desert land by leveraging
advanced technologies. For instance, Israel has perfected water
desalination, a project initially created in the US. It has built about
400 desalination plants, including one in California and another one in
Chennai.

Since bilateral cooperation in this arena is well underway,
[[the]{.mark} trilateral [partnership can]{.mark}]{.underline} work on
wastewater recycling, drip irrigation for Indian \[end page 4\] farmers
and crafting other innovative technological solutions to environmental
problems. It can [[make 'clean and affordable energy for all' a
reality]{.mark} in the three countries. This will help achieve SDG 7 and
contribute to the global efforts in tackling the issues arising due to
climate change.]{.underline}

e\) **[Agriculture]{.underline}**

[Ag]{.underline}riculture [is a vital sector where the three countries
should collaborate to install a modern and sustainable system with high
productivity. The use of [smart farming solutions]{.mark} such as
AI-enabled ag]{.underline}ricultural [tech]{.underline}nology[,
increasing ag]{.underline}ricultural [biodiversity, smart logistics for
post-harvest deliveries, adoption of automation and future
tech]{.underline}nologies [[are areas where the three]{.mark} countries
[can jointly undertake research]{.mark} and explore
opportunities.]{.underline}

[Collaborations between the agri-tech start-ups in the three countries
have to be encouraged. [The use of A]{.mark}]{.underline}rtificial
[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence [[in]{.mark} the [farming]{.mark}
sector]{.underline}, such as AI-enabled systems to detect pests and
weeds, agricultural robotics, in predictive analytics and precision
farming, in crop and soil health monitoring systems and in weather
forecasting to detect unpredictable weather conditions, [[will gain
further impetus]{.mark} through the collaborations of the
start-ups.]{.underline}

f\) [Skill Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship]{.underline}

The three countries can collaborate in initiatives aimed at skill
development, especially of the youth, in emerging technologies like
Blockchain, AI and Data science India and the US can share existing
frameworks like the 'Project Future Ready' launched by a partnership
between Dell Technologies, American India Foundation, National Skill
Development Corporation and the University of Mumbai.

This platform aims to equip the future workforce through "career
mentoring, leveraging online skilling platforms and providing market

aligned skills training for employability and inculcating
entrepreneurial mind-set"vii.

Israel and India have instituted similar initiatives like the
'India-Israel Global Innovation Challenge', which seeks to work on
innovative solutions in agriculture, health and digital health. These
research competitions encourage the youth to participate in
brainstorming solutions for common crises while providing an avenue for
upcoming entrepreneurs and innovators.

These positive bilateral partnership experiences can be taken forward in
the trilateral partnership for extracting greater value in developing
the future workforce and coming up with collaborative solutions.

Other areas in which the three countries, their specialised defence
agencies and start-up cities can collaborate include, and are not
limited to, quantum science, artificial intelligence, blockchain, UAV &
Drones and 5G/6G. All three nations have excellent facilities to pursue
R&D on these disruptive hybrid technologies.

For example, while Israel has developed an academic and industrial
consortium to research on quantum technology, the US' National Quantum
Initiative Act with a US\$1.2bn allocation and India's National Mission
on Quantum Technology and Applications are all engaged in studying the
applications of quantum technology. Blockchain is another beneficial
technology for cybersecurity and communications which India, US and
Israel can collaborate on, led by Israel's expertise.

Conclusion

[Through political changes, consensus and trust-building between the
three countries]{.underline}, [a trilateral partnership can be achieved
as win-win proposition. [Collaborating on defence]{.mark} innovation
[will **strengthen the relationship**]{.mark} by allowing each nation to
utilise their tech]{.underline}nological [pool of resources and highly
trained human resources in science and
tech]{.underline}nology[.]{.underline} \[end page 5\]

[[The]{.mark} trilateral [partnership has **a host of
strategic**]{.mark} **and pragmatic [benefits]{.mark}** for each of the
nations involved. The US, Israel and India share a common interest [in
combatting]{.mark} international **[terrorism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Towards this end, an effective and organised intelligence sharing
mechanism can be helpful for each of them. Furthermore, [the partnership
can assist in thwarting their unruly neighbours and rivals.]{.underline}

In addition, [this trilateral cooperation can also help add a new member
(unofficially) to the Indo-Pacific security architecture. The Quad is
growing steadily and might need extra military and logistical
support]{.underline}, [which Israel could provide.]{.underline}

Countries like China have been achieving steady progress in hybrid
defence technologies like AI, quantum computing, robotics and drones
through industrial strategies such as "Made in China 2025". [[The US'
**loss of competitive advantage**]{.mark} in hybrid defence
tech]{.underline}nologies like AI, quantum computing, robotics and
drones [because of the steady progress]{.underline} in these
technologies [in other countries [can be countered]{.mark} by a **joint
initiative** of the three countries.]{.underline}

[[India has much to gain]{.mark} from the trilateral cooperation [in
**multiple domains** such as **defence**, **space**,
**tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[**and
innovation**,]{.underline}]{.mark} in modern arenas of [[the]{.mark}
**digital [economy]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and in combating **[climate
change]{.mark}** by providing clean [and]{.mark} affordable
**[energy]{.mark}** to all.]{.underline} Israel could also capitalise on
a trilateral cooperation to gain unlimited access to the Indian market
and the markets of India's traditional allies in Asia and Africa.

### Top-Level + Net-Benefit Explanation/Extension

#### Instead of increasing U.S. emerging tech cooperation with *[NATO]{.underline}*, the counterplan increases U.S. cooperation with *[India]{.underline}* and *[Israel]{.underline}*. This [solves the case]{.underline} by uniting three leading tech democracies with [robust start-up ecosystems]{.underline} and [thriving innovation hubs]{.underline} --- that's Patil. 

#### This also creates a [strong trilateral alliance]{.underline} that prevents a long list of [global catastrophic risks]{.underline} including [terrorism]{.underline}, [global authoritarianism]{.underline}, the [LIO]{.underline}, [climate change]{.underline}, [water scarcity]{.underline}, [agriculture]{.underline}, [space]{.underline}, [energy]{.underline}, and [hybrid war]{.underline} --- that's Sabu and Dani. 

#### Adopting the counterplan *[alone]{.underline}* is key because it [signals]{.underline} strong U.S. support. This changes India and Israel's [perception]{.underline} that the U.S. will treat them as "[junior partners]{.underline}" and [supercharges]{.underline} trilateral cooperation [in other areas]{.underline} --- that's Carafano. 

#### This [outweighs]{.underline} and [turns]{.underline} the case. Catastrophic risks are [interlocking]{.underline} and [wide-ranging]{.underline}. Actively resist the [cognitive biases]{.underline} that write-off these "laundry list" impacts because they lack a "specific scenario."

**\[Note: GCRs = Global Catastrophic Risks\]**

4\. Sexy and unsexy risks

[Existential risks are sexy]{.underline}

[[Some]{.mark} global catastrophic [risks are sexier than
others.]{.mark} There is something about them that catches our
imagination. A meteor strike that consigns humanity to the fate of the
dinosaurs. An outbreak of a highly contagious, highly deadly disease
that spreads around the globe before we even know what is happening.
Hastily deployed nuclear weapons that precipitate a devastating nuclear
winter. The emergence of an all-powerful artificial superintelligence
that regards humans as a threat]{.underline}, or (say) as useful raw
materials for paperclip manufacture, [and decides to hunt down and kill
every last one of us. Sexy risks]{.underline}, I suggest, [are neat,
quick, and techy.]{.underline}

Epistemic neatness

Sexy risks have relatively clear disciplinary homes. It is not
particularly difficult to identify the academic fields that would be
best placed to understand these risks, even if multiple disciplines may
need to be involved in devising or implementing potential responses.
Astronomers are best placed to investigate the risk of asteroid and
comet impacts; likewise, epidemiologists and biologists in relation to
pandemics, physicists and meteorologists in relation to the risk of a
nuclear winter, and computer and neuro scientists together with
philosophers in relation to AI risks. One need not work in the field to
have a good intuitive grasp on where to look for the experts on sexy
risks. The reasonably transparent disciplinary ownership bypasses much
of the well-known difficulties in conducting inter- and multi-
disciplinary research, and is likely also conducive to public trust on
these experts. \[end page 7\]

Sudden onset

[[Sexy risks are]{.mark} expected to crystallise [abrupt]{.mark}ly,
[with obviously catastrophic outcomes]{.mark} from as little as a few
hours to]{.underline}, at most, [a few short years. There may be an
unexpected strike, or a tipping point; [suddenly all hell breaks
loose]{.mark}. Or at least]{.underline}, [this [is how]{.mark} we tend
to [imagine these]{.mark} risks to unfold.]{.underline} With the
arguable exception of long ago global pandemics21, we have no real
experience with these risks.

Technology is involved

Sexy risks have a close relationship with rather flattering ideas about
human ingenuity and intellectual prowess. Technological progress is seen
as either the cause (nuclear war, deadly AI) or the only plausible
solution (destruction or deflection of collision hazards in space, new
vaccines to solve pandemics; solar flare shields). For many of us there
is intrinsic intellectual appeal in thinking about potential
technological fixes that could swiftly save large numbers of people from
untimely death or untold suffering. Others may find even greater appeal
in thinking through the ways in which existing or anticipated future
technology could unleash powers we cannot control, to catastrophic
consequences; a fittingly Promethean punishment for humanity's titanic
inventiveness, perhaps.

[Collective action GCRs are unsexy]{.underline}

[[Unsexy risks]{.underline}]{.mark}, in contrast, [[are]{.mark}
conceptually disturbing]{.underline}, [["wicked"
problems]{.underline}]{.mark} (Head and Alford, 2015; Levin et al.,
2012) [that strain the mind's eye. [Among these]{.mark} risks [are
**climate change**,]{.mark}]{.underline}22 [[**topsoil degradation and
erosion**, **biod**]{.mark}iversity [**loss**, **overfishing**,
**freshwater scarcity**]{.mark}, mass un- and under- employment, fiscal
unsustainability, and]{.underline} last but not least, the black
elephant23 of [overpopulation.]{.underline}

[Unsexy risks arise [from gradual damage to collective goods]{.mark}
which are [indispensable to]{.mark} the [survival]{.mark} and
flourishing of human beings and human societies. The harm is neither a
matter of blameless bad luck]{.underline}, [nor blameable conduct by
villainous or blundering agents.]{.underline} Instead, [[the harm is
driven by **the aggregate impact over time**]{.mark} of human
populations]{.underline}, people behaving as they normally do, [going
about our individual lives in fairly ordinary ways. Unsexy risks are
messy, creeping, and politicised.]{.underline}

Epistemic messiness

[Unsexy risks resist precise definition and do not to map well onto
traditional disciplinary boundaries or institutional loci of governance.
Robust research into the causes of and possible solutions to unsexy
risks require the combination of perspectives from multiple wildly
different disciplines]{.underline}, [which is a daunting prospect to
many researchers and a poor match to how centres of research tend to be
organised and funded. For example, in order to achieve an in-depth
understanding of overfishing, it is not enough to understand the
biological processes involved]{.underline} (e.g. catching valuable
species at a higher rate than fisheries can replenish, the
disproportionate removal of mature fish with higher reproductive
fitness, etc)[. One must appreciate the all major facets of the problem,
including its drivers, whether demographic]{.underline} (population
growth generating greater demand for fish and a greater number of people
seeking livelihoods through fishing)[, economic]{.underline} (e.g.
drivers of over-capacity of in the fishing sector)[, or
behavioural]{.underline} (environmentally damaging fishing techniques
and practices) [as well as social factors complicating a
solution]{.underline} (e.g. the prevalence of pirate fishing and modern
slavery in certain countries' \[end page 8\] fishing fleets)[.
And]{.underline} last but not least, [one must be able to engage with
the ethical and legal framework to which any solution would need to
conform, as overfishing]{.underline}, [like all other unsexy
risks]{.underline}, [is closely related to people's freedoms and
livelihoods.]{.underline}

The epistemic messiness makes research inherently more complicated in
practice. It also reduces the chances of there being individual experts
able to advise policy-makers and productively engage with the public.
Instead, in relation to unsexy risks we tend to see fractional expertise
from individuals situated within non-overlapping silos (natural
scientists, philosophers, legislators, social scientists, economists,
activists), whereby most experts are only able to speak knowledgeably
about specific, disjointed aspects of the GCR. Those other aspects of
diagnosing or mitigating the risk which fall outside the expert's field
are liable to neglect, mischaracterisation or misunderstanding, for
example by misguided reliance on false or outdated received wisdom. Much
like the proverbial blind men patting seemingly different creatures and
struggling to conceptualise the overall elephant, these fractional
expertises can lead to contradictory pronouncements, undermining public
trust in experts while creating a misleading impression that the very
existence of the unsexy risk is a matter of subjective opinion.

Gradual build up

[The complexity of unsexy risks is not assisted by their incremental
onset. [These]{.mark} are ["**boiling frog**" phenomena]{.mark} that
[play out in **slow motion**]{.mark} -- at least as perceived by humans.
[The creeping nature]{.mark} of unsexy risks [obscures the **extent**
and **momentum** of **accumulated** and **latent damage**]{.mark} to
collective goods]{.underline}24, [[while **shifting
baselines**]{.underline}]{.mark}25 [tend to go unnoticed,
**[misleadingly reset]{.mark}**ting **our [perception of]{.mark} what is
[normal]{.mark}**]{.underline}26[[.]{.mark} Even where we recognise that
something is a problem, we may still not recognise the underlying,
catastrophic trendline, or just how much damage is already baked into
states of affairs that we come to regard as normal.]{.underline}

[Farmsteads slowly turning into desert]{.underline} (UNCCD, 2017;
Gomiero, 2016)[. Unusually mild winters and exceptionally hot summers
gradually becoming the norm]{.underline} (Hansen, Sato and Ruedy,
2012)[. Wildlife quietly vanishing]{.underline} (Dirzo et al., 2014;
Ceballos et al., 2017; Hallmann et al., 2017)[. First one, then another,
then several major cities facing major water shortages]{.underline}
(Welch, 2018; Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016)[. Commercial fishermen going
farther and farther afield to catch any fish]{.underline}, [and using
ever more extreme techniques]{.underline} (McKie, 2014; Roberts,
2012)[.]{.underline} Younger generations increasingly struggle to get
decent work, while public debt continues to balloon (ILO, 2018; WEF,
2017). [These are manifestations of unsexy risks, the symptoms of an
underlying ailment we do not quite comprehend]{.underline}, [or do not
want to acknowledge.]{.underline}

3\. Capitalising on Defence Innovation and a Start-Up Ecosystem

[**[Collaborating]{.mark}** and building on defence innovation
capabilities [is **key** to achieving]{.mark} a [**long-term advantage**
in]{.mark} defence [r]{.mark}]{.underline}esearch [[and
d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment[[.]{.mark} Therefore]{.underline}, [to
develop an India-Israel-U.S. defence tech]{.underline}nology
[partnership, the necessary [starting point must be]{.mark} the
**[existing]{.mark} defence [innovation bases or start-up
ecosystems]{.mark}** in Israel and the U.S. These have provided the
required tech]{.underline}nological [capabilities to their respective
militaries for years. India too has begun to harness the potential of
the start-up ecosystem as part of its broader efforts to achieve
self-reliance in defence.]{.underline}

In the U.S., compared with the initial technological innovation which
originated in government-funded research facilities, today the locus has
decisively shifted to the start-up ecosystem in Silicon Valley. This
shift happened due to:

1\. A decline in the defence R&D budget (from more than 1.2 percent of
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1976, to 0.8 percent of GDP in 2019).38

2\. Investment by the flourishing tech majors like Google and Amazon, in
innovative technologies such as robotics and quantum computing.39

3\. The enormous amount of venture capital investment in tech
start-ups.40

The 2017 National Security Strategy acknowledged that the private sector
had taken a lead over federal government agencies and underlined the
need for the federal government to tap into these private
capabilities.41 The Pentagon still spends a substantial amount of money
on R&D as compared to many other industrialised economies---\$59 billion
as per the 2021 budget request.42 However, its pace of R&D and
innovation is simply insufficient to maintain a lead over China, which
not only stole technologies from the West but also consistently expanded
investment in R&D over the last two decades and drafted its private
sector into this effort. These investments have intensified under the
"Made in China 2025" industrial strategy.44

One prime example of Silicon Valley's lead in emerging technologies is
quantum computing \[end page 15\] technology which can be applied to a
variety of defence applications such as navigation, radar systems and
sensing.45 Even as the U.S. plays catch-up up with China in quantum
research, American tech giants IBM and Google have already achieved
breakthroughs. In 2019, IBM unveiled Q System One, the first commercial
quantum computer.46 This was followed by Google, which claimed quantum
supremacy while unveiling Sycamore, its own quantum computer.47

[[The Pentagon has tried to tap into Silicon Valley]{.mark} innovations
[by setting up the]{.mark}]{.underline} Defense Innovation Unit
([[DIU]{.underline}]{.mark}, earlier known as DIUx)[.]{.underline}
Headquartered in Mountain View, California, in the heart of the Valley,
[DIU works closely with the tech industry and start-ups to shortlist,
fund and develop emerging tech]{.underline}nologies including AI,
autonomous systems, cyber, space, human systems, and advanced energy and
materials.48 [A key obstacle for engaging start-ups in the defence
sector is that start-ups view the defence establishment as bureaucratic
and its acquisition procedures as cumbersome.]{.underline}

[But by co-locating itself in the Silicon Valley and hiring staff from
the tech and start-up community, the Pentagon has attempted to align
itself with the vibrant start-up ecosystem and cut through traditional
bureaucratic red tape to develop new tech]{.underline}nology [and
integrate it into the military.]{.underline}49

[DIU has faced resistance from the risk-averse defence
bureaucracy]{.underline}, [but it promises to bring a
change.]{.underline} For instance, working with partners from the
Valley, the DIU developed and demonstrated a submarine-launched unmanned
aerial system within a record time of eight months from the project's
commencement in May 2019.50 By September 2020, this system had already
been deployed in the submarine fleet, something which typically takes
years in the Department of Defense's standard--- often described as
'antiquated'---acquisition procedure.51

[Compared to the U.S., [Israel takes a more organic approach]{.mark} to
defence innovation]{.underline}, [[by **synchronising** the
**military**, **academia**, **defence industry**, **start-ups** and
**investors**. This has created a **thriving defence innovation
base**]{.mark} centered around Tel Aviv and positioned Israel as a
tech]{.underline}nologically [advanced military power.]{.underline}
\[end page 16\]

There are multiple factors undergirding Israel's approach to defence
innovation.

• Foremost is the Jewish perception of 'siege mentality' --- a belief
that the world is predisposed to behave negatively towards them. Since
its creation, Israel has been surrounded by hostile neighbors, which has
led to the ingrained belief, in Israel's national and military
leadership, that the only way to overcome this hostile strategic
environment is by attaining a qualitative military edge over its
adversaries.53

• Another factor is a "double feeding" phenomenon --- whereby knowledge
about the military's technological requirements constantly circulates
through the ecosystem due to conscription or compulsory military
service. So, people who have served in the military become part of the
tech industry, academia and start-up ecosystem, and are well aware of
their military's requirements.54

• Conscription also means that most of Israelis get an exposure to
technology, either through the intelligence apparatus, coding or cyber
security.55 This creates a valuable tech-savvy resource pool for the
country's technological-industrial ecosystem.

• Funding is also important: Israel has consistently topped the global
charts for spending upwards of 4% of its GDP on R&D.56

[[These]{.mark} factors [make Tel Aviv the **second-best innovation
base**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [after Silicon Valley]{.underline},
[earning Israel the tag of "Start-up Nation".]{.underline}57

[Due to Israel's geography]{.underline}, [this ecosystem is close-knit
with most of the critical actors being co-located. [This **ingrained
advantage** has been utilised]{.mark}]{.underline} by the Israeli
Ministry of Defense's Directorate of Defense Research & Development
(also known as Maf'at), Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and the industry and
start-ups [[to apply emerging tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [for
defence use.]{.underline} For instance, the Iron Dome system developed
with U.S. assistance uses AI to analyse incoming missiles and determine
if people are in danger.58 Likewise, the IDF has used AI to understand
videos and read out the events taking place on the screen.59

The IAI too has sought to promote start-ups through an accelerator
track, which encourages select start-ups to develop new technologies
based on AI.60 \[end page 17\]

[India has begun to look at start-ups as a way to equip its military
with niche tech]{.underline}nology [capabilities.]{.underline} Drawing
from the U.S.' DIU experience, [[India launched]{.underline}]{.mark} a
Defence Innovation Organisation and Innovations in Defence Excellence
(**[[iDEX]{.underline}]{.mark}**) program in 2017 [[to work with]{.mark}
the [R&D institutes, academia, industry, start-ups and]{.mark}
individual [innovators to]{.mark} create solutions to [overcome]{.mark}
the military's tech]{.underline}nological
[[shortcomings.]{.underline}]{.mark}61 Early technologies identified by
iDEX for R&D include soldier protection systems, secure hardware
encryption devices, GPS anti-jam devices, unmanned surface and
underwater vehicles, and 4G/LTE tactical local area network, among
others.62 According to the government, more than 300 start-ups are
currently engaged by the iDEX program.63 To learn more from DIU
experience on engaging start-ups, India and the U.S. have also agreed to
assign Indian liaison officers to the DIU's unit in Silicon Valley.64

[[There is an opportunity to take this **one step forward** by **joining
hands**]{.mark} with Israel and the U.S. on emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies[. [This]{.mark} potential collaboration [must
**conjoin the three innovation hubs**]{.mark} of Silicon Valley, Tel
Aviv and Bengaluru [to capitalise on their **respective
strengths**]{.mark} and declared national tech]{.underline}nology
[priorities.]{.underline} As Table 2 shows, Bengaluru and Hyderabad,
separated by roughly 550 kms., have a vibrant defence industrial base65
with multiple defence public sector units, the Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO) research establishments, private sector
companies (including joint ventures with American and Israeli companies)
and several start-ups in the defence and aerospace sector which are
already contributing in various capacities to India's defence and space
needs. \[end page 18\]

\[Several tables omitted --- see URL; end pages 19-21\]

As evident, Israel and the U.S. have already reached an advanced stage
of research and cooperation for many of these technologies --- compared
to India which is still discussing the implications of some technologies
like AI and quantum computing, and expanding its technological
capabilities in others --- such as robotics.82

[These are disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [and will shape military
doctrines and direct the nature of future warfare.]{.underline} A
glimpse of this disruption was available during the fighting between
Armenia and Azerbaijan in September-November 2020 over the disputed
Nagorno-Karabakh territory. During the fighting, Azerbaijan deployed
armed drones (purchased from Israel and Turkey) and smart weapons to
inflict significant damage on Armenia, which relied on its air defences
and tanks.83 \[end page 22\]

This example, along with similar experiences from the battlefields in
Syria and Libya, demonstrates that "software-first" technologies like
AI-enabled drones and robotics will play a decisive role in determining
the outcomes of the wars of the future.84

This collaboration also offers opportunities for the Indian IT companies
which have done coding for the Indian military, to play a major role.
Companies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and HCL Technologies
can help the Indian military better identify global technological trends
and participate in defence innovation.

[These tech]{.underline}nologies [provide a good foundation for
[trilateral]{.mark} defence [coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}, [which
[will give a **tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [**[edge]{.mark}**
to their respective militaries. Acquisition of these [capabilities
will]{.mark} particularly [augment options for]{.mark} the Indian and
American militaries in **[dealing with an aggressive
China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[which has adopted]{.mark} a **[hybrid
warfare]{.mark} strategy** against its adversaries.]{.underline}

#### 2. [Catalyzes Private Sector]{.underline} --- trilateral cooperation [incubates]{.underline} and [accelerates]{.underline} emerging tech innovation.

("Shaping the Israel-India-US defense technology partnership," *The
Times of Israel*, June 14^th^, Available Online at
https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/shaping-the-israel-india-us-defense-technology-partnership/,
Accessed 07-14-2022)

[Israel-India defense ties have flourished since]{.underline}
establishing formal diplomatic relations in [1992. In]{.underline} July
[2017]{.underline}, Narendra Modi became the first-ever Indian Prime
Minister to visit Israel, signaling a full normalization of the
relationship. During Modi's visit, [the bilateral ties were upgraded to
a strategic partnership. A core element of this relationship is **robust
defense cooperation**.]{.underline}

[There is an opportunity to **take this bilateral cooperation forward**
and **expand it to [a trilateral]{.mark} one** by shaping a **[start-up
collab]{.mark}oration** between India, Israel and the US. Such a
potential collaboration [can **focus on emerging
tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [like robotics,]{.underline}
artificial intelligence ([AI]{.underline})[, and quantum computing. This
collaboration will build on the national tech]{.underline}nological
[priorities of these three like-minded, tech-savvy
democracies.]{.underline}

A shared threat perception of being surrounded by hostile neighbors has
driven Israel-India proximity. Israel's annual arms sales to India of an
average \$1 billion are the mainstay of this relationship. It has
supplied India drones, radar systems, satellite imagery, hand-held
thermal imagers and night vision devices, proving particularly valuable
in counterterrorism operations.

Both countries have co-developed and operationalized the Barak-8 missile
defense system. Israel has also participated in India's initiative of
developing a domestic defense-industrial capability. Israeli companies
like Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems
have established joint ventures with Indian partners to build niche
subsystems and homeland security systems. In fact, Israeli companies
have quickly identified and used the unique technological solutions
offered by Indian companies. A prominent example is Bengaluru-based
Tonbo Imaging, whose specialized electro-optics technology is part of
Israel's precision-guided bombs for years.

Just like Israel-India defense cooperation, India-US defense ties too
have flourished. Their collaboration spans defense sales and technology
co-development and co-production. Moreover, India's aerospace sector has
also become an active participant in the global supply chain of Boeing
and Lockheed Martin.

[Capitalizing on]{.underline} these [bilateral synergies, [the
three]{.mark} countries [can **come together** to advance their shared
tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nological [[goals.]{.mark} The rapid
development of emerging tech]{.underline}nologies [is making a **solo
national effort** to develop and adopt them **inadequate**. The **tech
lead** of the US and its allies has **diminished** in the last few years
as **China** and **Russia** have **collaborated** to attain a
**competitive advantage**.]{.underline}

[Israel and the US have already begun to collaborate on some emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies[. That collaboration has to expand to enlist
India, the principal US partner in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline} The
financial logic of such partnership becomes even more apparent with the
challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has strained economies and
resource mobilization and distracted many countries from their strategic
goals. [Such potential [coop]{.mark}eration [will enable cost-sharing
for innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[leading to **optimal use of
finite**]{.mark} **budgetary [resources]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} achieving
[**economies of scale**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The idea of trilateral cooperation is not unknown -- but it is
unfulfilled. In recent years, Indian American diaspora associations and
Jewish American associations in the US have repeatedly raised the idea
of a technology triangle between the three countries. Similarly, in
September 2020, Bonnie Glick, then Deputy Administrator of the United
States Agency for International Development, revealed that the three
countries had explored initial cooperation in 5G communication
technology.

[Establishing [a **startup corridor**]{.mark} involving Tel Aviv,
Silicon Valley, and Bengaluru]{.underline}, [which brings together the
existing defense innovation communities located in these
geographies]{.underline}, [[can be a **crucial step**]{.mark} in
materializing this trilateral partnership. This corridor can
cover]{.underline} eight [emerging tech]{.underline}nologies initially:
quantum science, AI, drones, blockchain, autonomy and robotics, 5G/6G,
additive manufacturing, and advanced battery technology.

In some technologies like AI and quantum science, Israel and the US have
already reached an advanced stage of research and cooperation, compared
to India, which is in the early stages of research. But all of these
technologies figure prominently in the three countries' national
technology priorities. Therefore, [they will provide a **good
foundation** for trilateral defense cooperation.
[It]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[promises to give a
**tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[**edge** to]{.mark} their
[militaries, develop **interoperability**, and reinforce]{.mark}
American and Israeli companies' [access to the Indian defense
market.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To take forward the idea of a start-up corridor, [the three countries
can initiate]{.underline} discussions for a [**[formal
collaboration]{.mark}** between India's D]{.underline}efence
[I]{.underline}nnovation [A]{.underline}gency[, Israel's
D]{.underline}irectorate of [D]{.underline}efense [R]{.underline}esearch
& [D]{.underline}evelopment [and the US's D]{.underline}efense
[I]{.underline}nnovation [U]{.underline}nit[. They
[can]{.mark}]{.underline} then [[institute **flagship
tech**]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [**[R&D programs]{.mark}** to develop
use case scenarios. The three countries can create [a **seed
fund**]{.mark} to enable partnerships [between]{.mark} the respective
defense [innovation ecosystems]{.mark}. Such a fund will offer initial
funding to the start-ups' ideas]{.underline}, [even before reaching the
tech]{.underline}nology [demonstration stage. The seed fund [may
take]{.mark} the form of [a **multi-year commitment**]{.mark} from the
three countries.]{.underline}

Another way to forge collaboration between start-ups is to hold
hackathons where teams representing the three countries will work on
problem statements identified by their militaries. [An additional layer
will be an **academic collaboration** among the three countries' premier
tech institutions. Potential partners can be the Indian Institutes of
Technology (India), Weizmann Institute of Science (Israel)
and]{.underline} the [M]{.underline}assachusetts [I]{.underline}nstitute
of [T]{.underline}echnology (United States)[.]{.underline}

Finally, India will host the G20 Summit in 2023. The G20 does not deal
with defense cooperation issues, but it is the world's most influential
economic multilateral forum. More importantly, its members include 11 of
the world's top 20 arms exporters. The host country can invite non-G20
members through the regional consultation mechanism process. India can
leverage this to make a symbolic gesture and invite Israel to attend the
G20 Summit. With its unique experience in start-ups and innovation,
Israel will fit the bill at the G20 meetings.

[Tech]{.underline}nology [has become the **main driver** of contemporary
i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations, [shaping emerging
potential alliances. Keeping up with this broader trend, [Israel, the

[[A **key dimension**]{.mark} shaping this trilateral partnership [will
be developing **interoperability**]{.mark} among the three militaries.
For this]{.underline}, [[the three]{.mark} partners [should
define]{.mark} their conceptions of interoperability [and
elaborate]{.mark} which elements of the force structure should be
interoperable.]{.underline} A useful definition of interoperability from
the U.S. Department of Defence is "The ability of systems, units, or
forces to provide services to and accept services from other systems,
units, or forces, and to use services so exchanged to enable them to
operate effectively together."86 [[The three]{.mark} militaries [should
also institute an **annual joint exercise**]{.mark} to develop and
understand the challenges in achieving interoperability.]{.underline}87
[Such an exercise should be [geared towards countering hybrid
warfare.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### They Say: "India and/or Israel 'Say No'"

[The Israeli Defence Minister]{.underline}, Benjamin
[Gantz]{.underline}, recently [concluded a]{.underline} long-pending
[visit to India. [Both]{.mark} countries [decided to expand their
defence coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} during his visit, [[focusing
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[emerging
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies[. Gantz and his Indian
counterpart]{.underline}, Rajnath [Singh]{.underline}, [signed the
'India--Israel Vision on Defence Cooperation' to put together a
comprehensive 10-year roadmap to identify new areas of collaboration.
The two ministers also exchanged a 'Letter of Intent' to enhance
cooperation on futuristic defence
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[This focus on tech]{.underline}nological [cooperation precedes the
robust ties in the defence and security sector]{.underline}, [spanning
arms sales, military exchanges, and counterterrorism
engagement.]{.underline} This article gives a broad overview of the
bilateral defence relationship and suggests a way forward for defence
technology cooperation.

Since establishing ties in 1992, India and Israel have traversed a long
path. Driven by the shared threat perception of being surrounded by
hostile neighbours, both countries deepened their exchanges in multiple
spheres, including extensive people-to-people contact. The defence and
security partnership provided the anchor for this bilateral interaction.
The Kargil War of 1999 cemented this cooperation when Israel was one of
the few countries to provide direct military assistance to India.
Notably, these robust ties precede the India--US defence cooperation
which materialised much later.

Defence trade

Since then, India has tended to rely more on Israeli technology and
equipment for border security and counterterrorism. This has made India
the largest purchaser of Israeli weapons in the last decade, surpassing
even the United States, Israel's principal military ally in West Asia
(see figure 1).

\[Graphic Omitted --- see URL\]

India's arms purchases have provided Israel's defence-industrial base
with steady and much-coveted access to a sizeable market. This passage
to the Indian market is even more significant for Israel's defence
industry since the United States, concerned with the qualitative upgrade
of Chinese military capabilities, had vetoed Israeli arms sales to China
in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

\[Graphic Omitted --- see URL\]

\[Graphic Omitted --- see URL\]

These equipment and platforms have undoubtedly strengthened the Indian
surveillance and operational capabilities, particularly in the Kashmir
Valley and on the borders. For example, Israeli sensors, Heron drones,
hand-held thermal imaging devices, and night vision imaging equipment
have proved advantageous for the Indian Army in checking infiltration on
the Line of Control and counter-insurgency operations in the Valley's
hinterland. Likewise, last March, the Indian Army leased four Heron
drones from Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) to deploy them on extended
surveillance missions on the Line of Actual Control, amidst the border
stand-off with China.

Defence technology cooperation

[Beyond defence trade, India and Israel have also been engaged in
defence tech]{.underline}nology [cooperation.]{.underline} The symbol of
their success is the Barak-8 air and missile defence system.
Co-developed by the IAI and India's Defence Research Development
Organisation (DRDO), Barak-8 is available in land and maritime versions.
It can intercept targets like fighter aircraft, drones, ballistic, and
cruise missiles up to 150 km. Further, IAI is also collaborating with
the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited to convert second-hand Boeing-767
civilian aircraft into mid-air refuellers for the Indian Air Force.

Building on the success of Barak-8, in September 2020, India and Israel
established a bilateral sub-working group on defence industrial
cooperation. This group is expected to facilitate further technology
transfers to India, enable utilisation of bilateral resources, and share
industrial capabilities.

Israel's participation in 'Make in India'

[Supporting the Indian government's focus on building national
defence-industrial capabilities, [Israeli companies have forged
partnerships with]{.mark} the [India]{.mark}n private sector. This
replicates the pattern followed by the major American aerospace
companies]{.underline}, [which too have built successful commercial
collaborations with their Indian private sector partners.]{.underline}

The IAI, Elbit Systems, and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems have set up
joint ventures with Bharat Forge, Tech Mahindra, Adani Group, and Tata
Advanced Systems to produce niche sub-systems and homeland security
systems. For instance, IAI's subsidiary, ELTA Systems, has a joint
venture with the Tata Advanced Systems, called Hela Systems, which
manufactures communications, electronic warfare, and homeland security
systems. Another collaboration between Elbit Systems and Bharat Forge,
called BF Elbit Advanced Systems, supplies artillery guns, guided
munitions, and mortar systems to the Indian military. Notably, Israeli
companies have quickly identified and utilised the niche technological
solutions offered by Indian companies. For instance, Bengaluru-based
Tonbo Imaging's specialised electro-optics technology has powered
Israel's precision-guided bombs for years.

Of course, a big challenge for these companies is uncertainties related
to India's protracted defence acquisition procedure. For instance, in
2019, Elbit Systems was declared the lowest bidder---L1, in the bid to
purchase towed artillery gun systems for the Indian Army. Yet, after
extensive price negotiations, the government shelved the order,
preferring indigenous alternatives. Similarly, plans to acquire an
additional fleet of Phalcon airborne warning and control system-enabled
planes have stalled for years.

Stepping-up defence collaboration

But beyond these usual challenges, [[there is]{.mark} a real
[opportunity]{.mark} for New Delhi and Tel Aviv [to **advance
coop**]{.mark}**eration**. The agreement on enhancing partnership in
futuristic defence tech]{.underline}nologies [is an effort in the right
direction. Given Israel's strong focus on R&D]{.underline}, [both sides
can collaborate on tech]{.underline}nologies [such as additive
manufacturing and advanced battery tech]{.underline}nology [and power
sources]{.underline}, [besides usual flagships such as
a]{.underline}rtificial [i]{.underline}ntelligence[, blockchain, and
robotics.]{.underline}

[To realise the true potential of this partnership]{.underline}, [[what
is needed]{.mark} now [is]{.mark} the [identification of **mutually
beneficial tech**]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies, [[followed by]{.mark} a
**[formal collaboration]{.mark}** between Israel's]{.underline} Maf'at
([D]{.underline}irectorate of [D]{.underline}efence
[R]{.underline}esearch & [D]{.underline}evelopment) [and India's DRDO
along with greater engagement [between]{.mark} their respective
[innovation ecosystems. This will create a **sustainable path for
collab**]{.mark}**oration** between the two tech-savvy
democracies.]{.underline}

#### [Status quo cooperation]{.underline} proves they'll both "say yes," but the counterplan is key to [formalize]{.underline} the partnership and make it [effective]{.underline}.

2\. [Imperative for a Trilateral Defence Tech]{.underline}nology
[Partnership]{.underline}

[Despite its flourishing tech]{.underline}nological[-industrial
innovation base, [the U.S.]{.mark} is now confronted with the reality
that it [no longer enjoys the absolute lead]{.mark} in many emerging
tech]{.underline}nologies, [especially in the defence sector such as
drones, robotics,]{.underline} artificial intelligence
([AI]{.underline})[, and quantum computing.]{.underline} Its principal
adversaries, [China and Russia]{.underline}, [have pursued the same set
of tech]{.underline}nologies [to reduce their capability gap with the
U.S. and attain competitive advantage.]{.underline} In 2017, Russian
President Vladimir Putin had declared that the country which takes the
lead in AI will rule the world.3 China has identified these technologies
as strategic technologies and anchored its flagship national policies
such as "Made in China 2025" industrial strategy on them.4 In the
Chinese Communist Party's conception, these technologies are multi-use,
which blurs the distinction between civil and military, thereby allowing
the Party to utilise these technologies not just for national governance
and industry, but for defence and security as well. Beijing has also
joined hands with Moscow to collaborate and innovate on these
technologies.5

[[China's]{.mark} confrontationist attitude against its neighbors and
adversaries]{.underline}--- as seen in the ongoing border standoff with
India in Ladakh---[coupled with its determined efforts to take the
[lead]{.mark} in emerging tech]{.underline}nologies, [[make it
imperative]{.mark} for India, the U.S. and other like-minded countries
[to bolster]{.mark} their existing [r]{.mark}]{.underline}esearch [[and
d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment [activities in such
tech]{.underline}nologies[. Though tech]{.underline}nological
[advancements are taking place at breakneck speed]{.underline}, [it is
clear that a solo national effort in developing and adopting critical
tech]{.underline}nologies [won't go far. Therefore]{.underline}, [[India
and the U. S. need to]{.mark} expand their effort and
[enlist]{.mark}]{.underline} another close partner,
[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to advance their
tech]{.underline}nological [goals.]{.underline} The financial logic of
such an effort becomes even more apparent in the face of the challenge
of a once-in-a-century pandemic of COVID-19, which has strained
economies and resource mobilisation, and distracted many countries from
their strategic goals. If [such cooperation]{.underline} is undertaken,
it [will enable **cost-sharing** for innovation]{.underline}, [leading
to optimal use of **finite budgetary resources** and achieving
**economies of scale**.]{.underline}6 \[end page 9\]

For the United States:

• [[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark} is a principal military ally in West
Asia. It [[is a tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologically [[advanced partner
for r]{.underline}]{.mark}esearch [[and d]{.underline}]{.mark}evelopment
[[in emerging tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [in defence and
cybersecurity]{.underline} and also other domains such as renewable
energy and food security.7 Israeli defence companies such as Israel
Aerospace Industries (IAI) have an extensive engagement with U.S.
defence companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. [Silicon Valley
majors]{.underline} such as IBM, Intel and Google [have tapped into Tel
Aviv's start-up ecosystem for years.]{.underline}

• [[India has emerged as a principal U.S. partner]{.mark} in the
Indo-Pacific and offers a large market for its defence
industry.]{.underline} The U.S. has developed a thriving defence and
security partnership with India since signing the "Framework Agreement
for Defence Cooperation" in 2005 (renewed in 2015).8 In 2020, the ties
were elevated to a "comprehensive global strategic partnership."9

For Israel:

• Substantial American foreign and military aid has enabled Jerusalem to
achieve a qualitative military edge over its quantitively superior Arab
neighbors.10 Israel has used American aid to innovate and develop
military hardware such as the Iron Dome and David's Sling missile and
air defence systems, providing its territory and population much-needed
protection from rockets and projectiles fired from neighboring
territories. As a Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) of the U.S., it gets
specific military benefits like advanced defence technologies on a
priority basis and intelligence-sharing.11 The high degree of mutual
trust between the two countries is also evident with Israel being the
only country to receive unfettered access to American military
technology and equipment such as the F-35 fighter jet.12

• India is the largest purchaser of Israel's weapons, which has provided
the latter's defence industry much-needed, stable access to a larger
market and funding for its R&D.13 There is also extensive
people-to-people contact between the two countries. Joining hands with
India in expanding the scope of bilateral defence cooperation to include
the U.S., will not only reinforce its access to the Indian market, but
also offer opportunities for exports to emerging markets in Asia and
Africa---India's traditional defence export destinations. \[end page
10\]

For India:

A potential [trilateral defence cooperation will build on the robust
bilateral defence and security cooperation developed in the last decade
with the U.S. and Israel. Both countries are major defence suppliers to
India. They have also taken the initial steps in joint R&D with India's
state-owned defence R&D base.]{.underline}

• Israel: Driven by the shared threat perception of being surrounded by
hostile neighbors, India-Israel relations have come a long way since the
establishment of diplomatic relations in 1992.14 Israel's annual arms
sales to India averages \$1 billion and is the mainstay of the bilateral
relationship. The purchase of various radar and missile defence systems
along with drones and avionics (see Table 4 in appendix) from Israel
have augmented the Indian military's surveillance and operational
capabilities.15 Israel has supplied India satellite imagery, hand-held
thermal imagers and night vision devices which have proved particularly
valuable in counterterrorism operations.16

Israel has aligned itself with the 'Make in India' initiative which has
prioritised the development of a domestic defence industry.17 Both
countries have co-developed and operationalised the Barak-8 air and
missile defence system.18 They have expanded this cooperation by setting
up a bilateral sub-working group on defence industrial cooperation, in
September 2020, to focus on technology transfer, co-development and
co-production, AI, innovation and joint export to friendly foreign
countries.19

[The three major Israeli defence companies]{.underline}---IAI, Rafael
Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems---[have
multiple]{.underline}, [long-term joint ventures with Indian private
sector companies]{.underline} including Bharat Forge, Tech Mahindra,
Adani Group and Tata Advanced Systems to produce niche sub-systems and
homeland security systems (see Table 5 in appendix). For instance, the
joint venture between Elbit Systems and Adani Defence and Aerospace
operates in Hyderabad, the only facility outside Israel which produces
the Hermes 900 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).20 In fact, Israeli
companies have been quick to identify and use the unique technological
solutions offered by Indian companies. A prominent example is
Bengaluru-based Tonbo Imaging, whose specialised electro-optics
technology has been part of Rafael and IAI's precision-guided bombs for
years. 21 \[end page 11\]

• United States: Since formalising defence cooperation, India has been
inching up the ladder in the U.S. defence bureaucracy: In 2016, it
acquired the unique status of 'Major Defense Partner' which opened
access to advanced American defence technology. In 2017, the updated
National Security Strategy described India as a "leading power and
stronger strategic and defense partner".22 This was followed by India
receiving the Strategic Trade Authorisation-1 status in 2018, enabling
it to access dual-use high technology items---a major breakthrough as
India had been denied these technologies for a long time.23

Defence trade and technology co-development and co-production are the
two most important dimensions of this relationship. Between 2005 to
2020, the bilateral defence trade was \$20 billion (see Table 4 in
appendix). 24 American defence equipment has added considerable value to
the Indian military's power projection and surveillance capabilities,
particularly in the Indo-Pacific domain.

Beyond defence trade, India's persistent efforts to achieve
self-reliance in defence have offered opportunities for bilateral
engagement in technology co-development and co-production through the
Defence Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI) mechanism, created in
2012.25 While the initial focus of this cooperation was on basic
technologies---identified as 'pathfinder projects',26 the approach has
evolved into a focus on customised technologies, which are mutually
beneficial. Current projects include co-development of air-launched
drones and lightweight small arms technology (see Table 1).27 Also as
part of the DTTI, the U.S. is working with India on aircraft carrier
design. These technologies are still in the exploratory phase and
therefore demonstrable progress is slow.

\[Table Omitted --- see URL\]\[end page 12\]

[[Through **commercial joint ventures**]{.mark} between American and
Indian companies, [India has built a substantial]{.mark}
defence-industrial [capability]{.mark}]{.underline}, [enabling domestic
players]{.underline}, like the Tata Group and Bharat Forge, [to
manufacture and export subsystems as an active participant of the global
supply chain]{.underline} (see Table 5 in appendix)[.]{.underline}28

[It is these existing bilateral partnerships that a [trilateral
coop]{.mark}eration will seek to synergise and expand. A focus [on
emerging tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies, [taking advantage of the
deep defence innovation in Israel and the U.S.]{.underline}, [[will
offer a **clear pathway** to **initiate** and **develop**]{.mark} this
cooperation.]{.underline}

[The idea of a trilateral cooperation is]{.underline} not unknown---but
it is [unfulfilled.]{.underline} In recent years, Indian American
diaspora associations along with Jewish American associations in the
U.S. have repeatedly raised the idea of a technology triangle between
the three countries.29 Similarly, in September 2020, Bonnie Glick, then
Deputy Administrator of the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID) revealed that the three countries had explored
initial cooperation in 5G mobile communication technology.30

### They Say: "Pakistan DA"

#### [Not Unique]{.underline} --- tensions and arms racing are [already]{.underline} high because of perceived India-Israel defense cooperation. 

**Arad 18** --- Shimon Arad, Ph.D. Candidate at the School of Political
Science at the University of Haifa (Israel), former Colonel in the

Accessed 07-18-2022)

[The [advancement of Pakistan's nuclear]{.mark}-missile [capabilities
and Israel's growing military ties with India are increasing]{.mark}
their respective military relevance for each other. In the absence of
formal diplomatic relations and against the backdrop of a prevailing
antagonistic public dialogue, the need for an effective and discreet
channel of communication between Islamabad and Jerusalem to mitigate
misunderstandings and misperceptions about each other's intentions is
growing.]{.underline}

An Antagonistic Dialogue

[A [high]{.mark} degree of [suspicion and mistrust exist]{.mark} between
Israel and Pakistan.]{.underline} In particular, [Pakistan seems to
presume the worst about Israel.]{.underline} At the end of December
2016, a fake-news story triggered a nuclear Twitter confrontation
between Israel and Pakistan. A website called "AWD News" claimed that
Israel's defense minister had threatened to destroy Pakistan with a
nuclear attack if it sent ground troops to Syria on any pretext.
Although clearly fake (the website misidentified the Israeli defense
minister as Moshe Ya'alon, who resigned in the previous May), Pakistan's
defense minister hastily tweeted a nuclear threat and warned Israel that
"Pakistan is a nuclear state too."

[The growing security [relationship between Israel and
India]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[serves to enhance conspiracy
theories]{.mark} about the existence of an Indo-Israeli alliance against
Pakistan.]{.underline} Thus, unsurprisingly the recent visit by Israel's
prime minister to India in January 2018 produced a bellicose Pakistani
response. The foreign minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, stated that
Pakistan could defend itself "despite this nexus between India and
Israel" that is based on their enmity with Islam. Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu wisely reacted by stating that "We (Israel) are not
enemies of Pakistan and Pakistan should not be our enemy either".

The latest decision by the U.S. administration to suspend most of the
military assistance to Pakistan has also given rise to suggestions that
the United States may be part of this anti-Pakistan allegiance. The
chairman of the Senate, Mian Raza Rabbani, recently warned that a nexus
between the United States, Israel and India is emerging and the Muslim
world needs unity to deal with that problem.

It is unclear to what extent this confrontational attitude truly
represents what Pakistan's leaders believe about Israel or to what
extent they based on internal and Islamic considerations and
constraints. Hussain Nadim recently claimed that among the high-ranking
security personnel, politicians and diplomats "there is a high
acceptance and willingness to engage with Israel", but they refrain from
doing so because of the fear of political and religious backlash.

The Significance of Israel-Indian Military Cooperation

[From a military perspective, [the Israeli-Indo]{.mark} security
relationship and the [modernization]{.mark} it brings to the Indian
armed forces [is understood by Pakistan to create vulnerabilities
in]{.mark} fundamental military areas undermining the conventional
[balance of power]{.mark} in South Asia.]{.underline} This security
relationship is perceived to have provided India with substantial
advantages in the modern aspects of warfare such as: network-centric and
electronic warfare capabilities; intelligence and information dominance;
day and night maneuverability; long-range modern strike capabilities
from the air and the sea that threaten Pakistan's strategic sites and
assets; and antiballistic missile defense systems that improve India's
ability to defend against Pakistani missiles.

[[To counter]{.mark} this, [Pakistan is looking to enhance its security
relationships with China and Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, given
its limitations in competing with India in a conventional arms race,
[[Pakistan is working to improve]{.mark} the integrity of [its
second-strike]{.mark} capabilities [and]{.mark} to [develop its nuclear
fighting]{.mark} capability [to offset India's]{.mark} conventional
[advantages.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[There is]{.mark} a lot of [concern that]{.mark} the [rapid
build-up]{.mark} in Asia of Chinese and American military power [will
make war more likely]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and that such a war between
nuclear-armed powers will be hugely destructive. In this view, arms
races are wasteful tragedies that unfold when adversaries fail to
negotiate security at a cheaper level of expenditures. Warnings about
arms races are also used by concerned anti-war groups]{.underline}, and
by China as part of its public diplomacy campaign. For example, Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesmen Zhao Lijian warned that "the US, the UK and
Australia's cooperation in nuclear submarines severely damages regional
peace and stability, intensifies the arms race."

[[**But arms races do not cause war**. Every]{.mark} case of [war that
followed an arms build-up was the consequence of the weakness of the
attacked party. Any caution]{.mark} by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies [in equipping for war will reduce
**deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and will]{.mark} set the
circumstances for whether there is a decision to go to war in Beijing.
It will [tempt]{.mark} Beijing with the prospect of [a successful fait
accompli attack]{.mark} against Taiwan and its outlying
islands]{.underline} of Kinmen, Wuqiu, Matsu, Pratas, Itu Aba, and
Penghu.

The Lessons Of History

No one can say for sure, but [[history suggests]{.underline}]{.mark}
that there is cause for [[optimism]{.mark}. During the [Kargil]{.mark}
War, India worked to contain the fighting to the regions around
Pakistan's original incursions and the war [concluded with no real
threat of nuclear escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Less than [two years later, the]{.mark} two countries plunged into
crisis]{.underline} once [again]{.underline}. In December 2001, five
terrorists from the Pakistan-based groups Lashkar-e-Tabia and
Jaish-e-Mohammed attacked the parliament building in New Delhi with
AK-47s, grenades, and homemade bombs, killing eight security guards and
a gardener. In response, India launched a mass military mobilization
designed to induce Pakistan to crack down on terrorist groups. As Indian
troops deployed to the border, terrorists from Pakistan struck again. In
May 2002, three men killed 34 people in the residential area of an
Indian army camp in Kaluchak, in Jammu and Kashmir. Tensions spiked.
India seemed poised to unleash a military assault on Pakistan. Several
embassies in New Delhi and Islamabad withdrew their nonessential
personnel and issued travel advisories. [The [standoff]{.mark} lasted
for several months, but [dissipated]{.mark} when it became apparent that
India lacked viable military options and that the long mobilization was
taking a toll on the Indian military]{.underline}'s men and materiel.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [also helped ease tensions
by urging both sides to start talking]{.underline}. India claimed
victory, but it was a Pyrrhic one, as Pakistan failed to sever its ties
with a range of terrorist organizations.

[[Other nuclear states have]{.mark} also [clashed without resorting to
nuclear weapons]{.mark}. In 1969, [China]{.mark}]{.underline}, then an
incipient nuclear weapons state, [[and the Soviet
Union]{.underline}]{.mark}, a full-fledged nuclear power, [[came to
blows over islands]{.mark} in the Ussuri River]{.underline}, which runs
along the border between the two countries. Several hundred Chinese and
Soviet soldiers died in the confrontation. Making matters worse, Chinese
leader Mao Zedong had a tendency to run risks and dismissed the
significance of nuclear weapons, reportedly telling Indian Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru that even if half of mankind died in a nuclear
war, the other half would survive and imperialism would have been razed
to the ground. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} despite Mao's views, [[the
crisis ended without going nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}, thanks in part
to the efforts of Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin, who took the
first step by travelling to Beijing for talks.

[There's reason to believe that [the current situation is similar.
Pakistan's]{.mark} overweening [military]{.mark} establishment
undoubtedly [harbors an extreme view of India]{.mark} and determines
Pakistan's policy toward its neighbor. [**The military**, however, **is
not irrational**]{.mark}. In India, although]{.underline} Prime Minister
Narendra [[Modi]{.mark} has a jingoistic disposition, he]{.underline},
too, [**[understands the risks]{.mark} of escalation**, [and]{.mark}
**he [has a firm grip on the]{.mark} Indian
[military]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Another source of optimism comes from]{.underline} what political
scientists call [the "nuclear revolution," the idea that the invention
of nuclear weapons fundamentally changed the nature of war. Many
strategists argue that [nuclear]{.mark} weapons' [destructive power is
so great that states understand the awful consequences]{.mark} that
would result [from using them---**and avoid doing so**]{.mark} **at all
costs**. [Indian and Pakistani strategists are no different]{.mark} from
their counterparts elsewhere. Even Pakistani Prime Minister]{.underline}
Imran [Khan]{.underline}, a political neophyte, [underscored the dangers
of nuclear weapons in his speech addressing the crisis]{.underline} last
week. And [Modi, for all his chauvinism, has scrupulously avoided
referring to India's nuclear capabilities]{.underline}.

[The decision by India and Pakistan to allow their jets to cross the
border represents a major break with the past. Yet so far [both
countries]{.mark} have taken only limited action. Their principal
[aim]{.mark}]{.underline}, it appears, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} what
the political scientist Murray Edelman once referred to as
[["**dramaturgy**"]{.mark}---theatrical gestures designed to please
domestic audiences. Now that both sides have gone through the motions,
**[neither is likely to escalate any further]{.mark}**. Peering into the
nuclear abyss concentrates the mind remarkably]{.underline}.

### They Say: "Permute: Do Both"

#### [Links To NATO Cohesion DA]{.underline} --- the counterplan [alone]{.underline} doesn't bring a controversial new proposal to NATO. 

#### [Doesn't Solve Trilateral Relations]{.underline} --- cooperating with NATO *[and]{.underline}* India and Israel perpetuates their treatment as [junior partners]{.underline} who always take a backseat to the U.S.'s "[main allies]{.underline}." Only the counterplan [alone]{.underline} signals the U.S.'s [serious commitment]{.underline} to the trilateral partnership. That's crucial to its [sustainability]{.underline} and [effectiveness]{.underline} --- that's Carafano. The impact is a long list of [global catastrophic risks]{.underline} that only a [stronger]{.underline} trilateral alliance can solve --- that's Sabu and Dani. 

## Unilateral/Domestic CP

### 1NC --- Unilateral/Domestic Innovation CP

#### Next off is the [Domestic Innovation CP]{.underline}. 

#### The United States federal government should:

#### • reform its EDT reprogramming and authorization restrictions and its DOD EDT review and procurement process;

#### • establish a National Security Innovation Committee;

#### • expand non-defense R&D funding in areas pertinent to national security, including semiconductors; 

#### • secure the American EDT pipeline; and

#### • collaborate with American universities to protect sensitive projects.

#### The first plank solves [EDT innovation]{.underline} and [tech leadership]{.underline} --- dual-path budgetary reform is key. 

**Zakheim 21** (Dov S. Zakheim, senior advisor at the CSIS, vice
chairman of the board for the Foreign Policy Research Institute, former
undersecretary of Defense and CFO for the DOD; \"Reform the Pentagon's
budget process, or lose our military and tech advantages\", 4-2-2021,

DOA: 7-15-2022)//ATJ

What do artificial intelligence, quantum computing, the Defense
Innovation Unit and reprogramming requirements have to do with one
another? The answer is, "Everything." For [[unless]{.mark} both
[**Congress** and]{.mark}]{.underline} Department of Defense
(**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [**seriously [reform]{.mark}** [the
manner]{.mark} in which [they move **funds** from one]{.mark}
appropriations [account to another]{.mark}, the [DOD's ability
to]{.mark} [introduce]{.mark} **new [tech]{.mark}**nologies rapidly
[will be]{.mark} **seriously [compromised]{.mark}** --- and with it,
potentially, the **nation's defenses.**]{.underline}

[The development and fielding of [new tech]{.mark}nologies
[involve]{.mark} a considerable amount of **[risk]{.mark}**. Not all
programs that are attractive on paper actually will succeed in the
laboratory. Not all that succeed when subjected to developmental testing
will succeed when put to the operational test. [The **earlier**
a]{.mark} potential cutting-edge [program is determined **unlikely
to**]{.mark} [**succeed**, the **sooner**]{.mark} its [funds should be
**transferred**]{.mark} to a different program, [via]{.mark} a system
termed "**[reprogramming]{.mark}**."]{.underline} Unfortunately,
**[[congressional restrictions render it]{.mark} exceedingly
[difficult]{.mark} to transfer funds from one new program to another
with any degree of alacrity.]{.underline}**

As currently mandated, [Congress [permits]{.mark} the Defense Department
to transfer **[only \$6 billion]{.mark}** from one appropriations
account to another [in any]{.mark} given fiscal
[year]{.mark}]{.underline}; [of that amount, [one
third]{.mark}]{.underline} --- termed Special Transfer Authority ---
[draws [from]{.mark} the **Overseas [Contingency]{.mark} Operations
[accounts]{.mark}.** The \$6 billion that can be transferred represents
[**less than 1 percent** of the department's]{.mark} **annual
[budget]{.mark}**. The chief financial officers of most corporations
have far more discretion when moving funds from one account to
another.]{.underline}

Congressional restrictions do not end there, however; indeed, they only
begin with a DOD proposal to move funds across accounts. [Above a
threshold that Congress has specified for programs in each appropriation
account, the [DOD must]{.mark} first [obtain **approval** from the
**O**]{.mark}ffice of **[M]{.mark}**anagement and **[B]{.mark}**udget,
and then from each of the four defense oversight committees: the
[**House** and **Senate**]{.mark} **Armed Services [Committees]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} the **[two]{.mark} defense [subcommittees]{.mark}** of the
House and Senate Appropriations Committees.]{.underline} ([[Any]{.mark}
transfer of **[intel]{.mark}**ligence-[related funding also
requires]{.mark} the approval of the **[two congressional]{.mark}
intelligence [committees]{.mark}**.]{.underline})

[The thresholds that Congress has set for programs can only be described
as risible.]{.underline} For example, [the Defense Department can only
move funds from a given research and development budget line item, or
one in the procurement account, without **prior committee approval**
from every one of the four committees if that line item totals **less
than \$10 million**, or **less than one-ten-thousandth** of the total
appropriations account.]{.underline} Moreover, [if the funds are
intended for starting a new program, the \$10 million threshold **cannot
be exceeded** over a **three-year period**. Should the department wish
to reduce a line item, it also must obtain **congressional approval**
for any actions involving cuts in **excess** of either \$10 million or
**a fifth of the program** in question, whichever is the smaller
amount.]{.underline}

If the congressional restrictions were not enough, [the [Defense]{.mark}
Department [has made life]{.mark} **more [difficult]{.mark} for itself**
[by conducting **only one review**]{.mark} of programs [in]{.mark}
between submission of its [annual]{.mark} budget
[requests]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2003, when serving as DOD
comptroller, I proposed adding "execution" to the planning, programming
and budgeting process, reflecting the so-called mid-year execution
review. It was in this review that funds from slow-spending programs
could be transferred to those spending more quickly, as long as the
congressional committees agreed to the transfers.

At the same time as I [proposed to codify "execution" into the
process]{.underline}, I also envisaged that the Defense Department would
conduct at least two execution reviews in addition to the long-standing
mid-term review. Sadly, [while this was incorporated into the system,
the additional reviews were not.]{.underline} By way of comparison, [[in
the **corporate world**, such reviews]{.mark}, and the **transfers**
they engender, [are]{.mark} held as frequently as **weekly** or even
**[daily]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The combination of congressional limitations and DOD inflexibility
undermine any effort to transfer funds rapidly, from a hi-tech program
that appears to be going nowhere to one that is far more promising. The
[rigidity]{.mark} of the system also [renders it]{.mark} more
[**difficult** for]{.mark} organizations such as [the
**D**]{.mark}efense **[I]{.mark}**nnovation **[U]{.mark}**nit [to
transfer funds]{.mark} from disappointing or slowly developing
commercial programs [to those of]{.mark} **greater [military
promise]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} also [offer]{.mark} more **[rapid
introduction]{.mark} in the field.**]{.underline}

[[If Congress is]{.mark} as [serious]{.mark} as it claims to be [about
ensuring]{.mark} that [America **secures**]{.mark} and **maintains [the
lead]{.mark} over China and Russia** [in]{.mark} artificial intelligence
and other **high-[tech]{.mark}**nology applications for military
operations, [it should]{.mark} revisit and [revise]{.mark} those
seemingly [**arcane budget rules** that **stifle innovation**
and]{.mark} **military [modernization]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And, in
parallel, the Defense Department should do all it can to ensure that the
funds it receives from Congress can be applied both quickly and
efficiently. [In this way both Congress and the DOD could most
[effectively **foster**]{.mark} and **reward** [the innovation that
would **ensure American** ]{.mark}**military [dominance]{.mark} on the
battlefield for many years to come.**]{.underline}

#### The other planks solve [EDT competition]{.underline} --- focus on [basic research]{.underline} is key to operationalizing future EDT benefits

- "war for talent"

- Avoids DoD O/S DA because the NSIC will provide a budget report to
  congress -- that means its priced in all the time

- NSIC solves businesses not wanting to invest in basic research --
  clarifies what the government wants to fund, giving stability to
  pursue it

I. Directing, Coordinating, and Incentivizing the NSIB

[The [tech]{.mark}nologies central to the 21st-century national security
landscape [are changing]{.mark} the future of competition and
[conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} These technologies [[include]{.mark}
advanced computing]{.underline}, quantum technology, artificial
intelligence (**[[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}**), autonomous capabilities,
**[[cyber]{.underline}]{.mark}**, advanced wireless communications (5G
and beyond), hypersonic weapons, [and **microelectronics**, among
others. In this dynamic technological environment, [to achieve]{.mark}
**competitive [advantage]{.mark}**, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[must]{.mark} strive to [be a "**first mover**"]{.mark} whenever
possible and a "fast second mover" if surprised by an opportunistic
competitor. The United States must also try to [protect **crucial
tech**]{.mark}nologies [by fostering]{.mark} their [development **in the
U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline} or allied nations and
providing safeguards to ensure they are secure and reliable. [Given the
nature of this open **competition**]{.underline}, however, [[the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates must also hedge against those
technologies that cannot be fully protected. We [should]{.mark}, in
essence, **[build higher fences around fewer
things]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Findings:

1\. [[The U.S.]{.mark} government **[lacks a]{.mark} formal
[structure]{.mark}** [that provides]{.mark} for more information sharing
and [**collaboration** among]{.mark} the **[disparate segments of the
NSIB]{.mark}**. This is the least developed and perhaps the most
critical function the government can carry out.]{.underline}

2\. [The [federal]{.mark} share of **total
[R&D]{.mark}**]{.underline}---at its lowest in over 60 years in
2018---[has **[decreased]{.mark}**, [giving]{.mark} way [to
**commercial**]{.mark}ly driven **[R&D]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12 [This
trend has [created]{.mark} both positive and [**negative consequences**
for]{.mark} the [NSIB]{.mark}. On one hand, this shift has increased the
total level of R&D funding in the U.S. marketplace. On the other hand,
[motivated by]{.mark} **short-term performance** and **[commercial
relevance]{.mark}**, U.S. [companies]{.mark} have [moved **away**
from]{.mark} the **[basic research]{.mark}** often [**necessary** to
drive]{.mark} generational **[tech]{.mark}**nological
**[advances]{.mark}** and instead focused on **shorter-term strategies**
tied to **quarterly earnings**.]{.underline}

[One manifestation of this trend is that today's biggest American
technology companies [focus more on **optimizing**]{.mark} **their
current [products]{.mark}** and services rather than investing in
**follow-on basic research**---the kind that earned American companies
**Nobel Prizes** in the past.13]{.underline}

3\. [[Universities are]{.mark} a **[critical]{.mark} node** of the NSIB.
Their [research in]{.mark} **sensitive areas**, including government
supported work on **[sensitive tech]{.mark}nologies**, is
[**vulnerable** to]{.mark} **foreign spying** and **[IP theft]{.mark}**.
At the same time, the openness and **attractiveness** of American
universities help promote **scientific innovation** and expand the
American knowledge base.]{.underline}

[USG outreach to academia should be coordinated across all agencies
supporting the NSIB.]{.underline} It should include better communication
of both the threats and the opportunities for those working within the
NSIB. [The partnership needs to be **integrated** between law
enforcement, counterintelligence, government labs, and policy
officials.]{.underline}

4\. USG engagement with companies and universities has helped raise
awareness of the challenge but faces limitations in information-sharing
and messaging.

• [**Inconsistencies** across USG agencies with regard to
**declassifying info**rmation about **Chinese activity** hamper the
ability to bring charges against **i**ntellectual **p**roperty
**thieves** and decrease the effectiveness of warnings about the scale
and effectiveness of China's efforts.]{.underline}

• [Even when information is declassified, the government lacks the tools
and resources to disseminate the information effectively.]{.underline}

Recommendations:

1\. [[Congress should authorize]{.mark} an interagency coordination
body---the "**[N]{.mark}**ational **[S]{.mark}**ecurity
**[I]{.mark}**nnovation **[C]{.mark}**ommittee"]{.underline}---[that is
responsible [for]{.mark} enabling, **[developing]{.mark}**, guiding, and
**safeguarding** the **[NSIB]{.mark}**. This entity would
[consolidate]{.mark} and elevate the **[existing]{.mark} agency lines of
[authority]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} create a [new]{.mark} layer of
[bureaucracy]{.mark}. Its work should be strategic and not
reactive.]{.underline}

• [The committee's goals would be to **foster innovation** in the United
States]{.underline} or among our close allies, [[protect **cutting-edge
innovation** from theft]{.mark} and exploitation by our strategic
competitors, and establish safeguards to ensure national security
applications are secure and reliable.]{.underline}

• The committee would aim to [facilitate common purpose and
**[coordinate]{.mark}d effort** among [the]{.mark} federated
[NSIB]{.mark} ecosystem, [from]{.mark} the **[traditional
defense]{.mark}** and national security community [to
**private**]{.mark}**-sector [innovation]{.mark} centers** and academia.
This effort should aim to [**focus** the NSIB]{.mark} ecosystem
[on]{.mark} the [innovations]{.mark} **most [important to]{.mark} the
national [competition]{.mark}**, [but **not**]{.mark} in a way that
dampens its greatest strength---dynamism---or [introduce]{.mark}s
**[bureaucratic obstacles]{.mark}**, which are the **enemy of
innovation**.]{.underline}

• The committee would [[**clarify** what the]{.mark} U.S. [government
**expects**]{.mark} of the NSIB, as the [private sector]{.mark} elements
of the ecosystem often [**struggle** to identify **sustainable**]{.mark}
**technological [investments in]{.mark} potentially [vulnerable
funding]{.mark} streams** over time.]{.underline}

• The committee would [formally designate the critical areas in national
technological competition and maintain an understanding of the dual-use
technologies being developed in the NSIB.]{.underline}

• Once identified, [these technologies must be prioritized with
long-term budgeting commitments.]{.underline} As such, [the [committee
should]{.mark} be responsible for coordinating and [submit]{.mark}ting
[a]{.mark} unified **[budget]{.mark} analysis** [to Congress **each
year**]{.mark} to evaluate all of the activities across the USG related
to the NSIB. This analysis will bring **clarity** to the **scope and
breadth** of investments in NSIB priorities and help policymakers
**rationalize** and **prioritize strategic investments**.]{.underline}

• The committee would have the responsibility to manage information
sharing across the government and the authority to task relevant
government agencies with developing and executing policies relevant to
the NSIB.

• The committee would provide a pathway for the private sector to
provide input on its work.

• [Congress would include an annual reporting requirement from the
committee, assessing the state of the U.S. NSIB]{.underline} and the
government's efforts to protect it.

• [The committee should be [**chaired** by the **DOD**]{.mark} and
include representatives from other government agencies with equities
related to national security innovation. [Members]{.mark} should
[include the **D**]{.mark}epartments **[o]{.mark}**f
**[C]{.mark}**ommerce, **[State]{.mark}**, and [**Treasury**]{.mark}
along with White House stakeholders such as [the **N**]{.mark}ational
**[S]{.mark}**ecurity **[C]{.mark}**ouncil, the **[O]{.mark}**ffice of
**[S]{.mark}**cience and **[T]{.mark}**echnology **[P]{.mark}**olicy,
the **[O]{.mark}**ffice of **[A]{.mark}**merican
**[I]{.mark}**nnovation, as well as other agencies]{.underline} as
Congress deems appropriate. Representatives from the various agencies
should be designated by the secretaries or agency heads but not below
the under-secretary level.

2\. [The [USG should **expand**]{.mark} **funding for [R&D]{.mark}** and
proposals [for **non-DOD arms**]{.mark} **of the
government**---[e]{.mark}.g., the Departments of **Homeland Security**,
**Energy**, and **Commerce**---[to ensure]{.mark} a strong U.S.-owned
and **[U.S.-based manufacturing]{.mark} center in key sectors, such as
semiconductors.**]{.underline}

[[Congress should]{.mark} authorize a new competitive grant program to
[fund **basic research** in]{.mark} areas important to 21st-century
competition, such as **[AI]{.mark}**, autonomy, quantum technology,
[or]{.mark} **advanced [computing]{.mark}**. The grant program should be
administered in coordination with the DOD to fill gaps in DOD
funding.]{.underline}

3\. While not sufficient to prevail in this competition,
[[protecting]{.mark} American technology and **[i]{.mark}**ntellectual
**[p]{.mark}**roperty [is]{.mark} a **[critical]{.mark}** part of the
U.S. approach. Efforts to **[secure the supply
chain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the recent Executive Order
securing the information and telecommunications supply chain, [and rules
establishing cyber protection standards [will]{.mark} be an important
part of [arrest]{.mark}ing [Chinese IP theft and
**counter**]{.mark}**ing one of [their]{.mark} greatest
[strengths]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Necessary, but not sufficient, steps
include the following:

• The U.S. government should establish, maintain, and publicly release a
list of academic institutions and other organizations that have a
history of improper technology transfer, IP theft, or cyber espionage,
or that operate under the direction of the PLA or Chinese intelligence
services. The government should ban individuals who are either members
of the PLA or affiliated with one or more of the organizations on this
list from obtaining an F visa or J visa to the United States.

• [The State Department should strengthen]{.underline} Security Advisory
Opinions ([SAOs]{.underline}) [for visas where there is potential for
the illegal transfer of sensitive or dual-use technology.]{.underline}
These SAOs, commonly known as Visas Mantis, should include a presumption
of denial for visa applicants flagged by the State Department as
potentially problematic. The State Department should inform companies in
critical technology areas when they are recruiting or hiring individuals
whose visa applications are flagged as such.

• [The USG needs new tools to combat economic and industrial espionage.
One such tool could be a new interagency committee and process to allow
victims of IP theft to confidentially report and provide evidence to
federal agencies to consider adverse action against foreign individuals
and entities the government determines have unlawfully acquired IP from
a U.S. person.]{.underline}

## RMA Advantage Answers

### 1NC --- RMA Advantage Answers

#### 1. [U.S. Wins Tech Race Now]{.underline} --- it [won't fall behind]{.underline} in defense R&D. 

**Sapolsky and Gholz 21**--- Harvey M. Sapolsky, Professor Emeritus at
MIT, the former Director of the MIT Security Studies Program, M.P.A. and
Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government at Harvard University, Eugene
Gholz, associate professor of political science at the University of
Notre Dame, served in the Pentagon as Senior Advisor to the Deputy

It is not that the United States cannot lag behind in some fields of
militarily relevant technology or be surprised on the battlefield.
[Technology advances on many fronts and is pioneered in many
places]{.underline}. Technological investment by potential adversaries
surely can raise the costs to the United States of blithely sticking to
operational concepts that previously promised great effectiveness at low
cost.8 [However, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has been
mobilized]{.mark} on such scale, for [so long]{.mark}, with a special
emphasis on applying its vast science and engineering resources to its
defense, [that it will not]{.mark} readily [fall]{.mark} [behind in
weapons tech]{.mark}nology or quality.]{.underline}

[The United States invests heavily in defense-related research and
development (R&D) activities]{.underline}. Figure 1 shows the past 40
years of history of U.S. inputs to defense research and development.
[Currently [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [invests more than 75
billion USD each year in defense R&D plus billions more in]{.mark}
Department of Energy [R&D investment for nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is about two-thirds of what all other
countries in the world, American friend or foe, spend on defense R&D.9
[[China is the]{.mark} only great [power that spends more on its entire
defense effort than the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [spends on just
defense R&D]{.mark}]{.underline}. Seventy-five billion dollars is more
than Russia, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, or Japan spends on
defense.10

#### 2. [AI Not Key To Military Power]{.underline} --- it has [no]{.underline} current military applications. 

**Horowitz 18** --- Michael C. Horowitz, professor of political science
and the associate director of Perry World House at the University of
Pennsylvania, received the 2017 Karl Deutsch Award from the
International Studies Association presented annually to a scholar under
age 40 who is judged to have made the most significant contribution to
the study of international relations and peace research, 2022
("Artificial Intelligence, International Competition, and the Balance of
Power," *Texas National Security Review*, May, Available Online at
https://tnsr.org/2018/05/artificial-intelligence-international-competition-and-the-balance-of-power/#article)

[It is [important to distinguish these potential technological
innovations from military innovations]{.mark}. While military
innovations are often linked to changes in technology,41]{.underline} it
is not always the case. Military innovations are significant changes in
organizational behavior and ways that a military fights that are
designed to increase its ability to effectively translate capabilities
into power.42 The use of aircraft carriers as mobile airfields by the
United States and Japan is a prototypical example. While [[AI]{.mark}
could potentially enable a number of military innovations, it is [not a
military innovation]{.mark} itself, [and no applications of AI have been
used in ways that would count as a military innovation]{.mark} at this
point.]{.underline}

Because AI research and technology are still in their early stages,
usage of AI in warfare is not even yet analogous to the first use of the
tank in World War I, let alone effective use of combined arms warfare by
the Germans in World War II (the military innovation now known as
blitzkrieg). [This limits analyses about [how narrow AI might one day
affect the balance of power and international politics]{.mark}. Most
research on technology and [international politics focuses on]{.mark}
specific, mature technologies, such as [nuclear weapons, or on military
innovations]{.mark}.]{.underline}43

#### 3. [China Won't Win The EDT Race]{.underline} --- it's too dependent on foreign innovation. 

**Frey and Osborne 20** --- [Carl Benedikt Frey]{.underline}, Oxford

[Decentralized [experimentation]{.mark} and decision-making
[will]{.mark} likewise [be critical if the world is to harness]{.mark}
the benefits of [a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence. [China is at
a disadvantage]{.mark} in this regard]{.underline}. The country's recent
surge in patent filings is often cited as evidence of its
innovativeness, but simply counting patents isn't a good way to measure
innovation: studies show that ten percent of patents account for roughly
90 percent of total patent value, meaning that the vast majority are of
little value. Patent citations offer a more useful indicator, and if we
look at the [100 most cited patents since 2003, not a single one comes
from China.]{.underline} Moreover, [[China's leading a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence [companies]{.mark}, including Tencent, Alibaba,
and Baidu, [are merely copies of Facebook, Amazon, and
Google]{.mark}]{.underline}, tailored to the Chinese market.

As the late economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron observed, [when a
country lags behind the technological frontier, [imitation and the
adoption of foreign technology can take it a long
way]{.mark}]{.underline}---and, in general, the further a country has
fallen behind, [the greater the role the state must play in driving
industrial catch-up.]{.underline} Thanks to state investment in mass
production technology, the Soviet Union grew rapidly during much of the
Cold War, as did [Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Indeed, numerous
scholars have attributed the ["Asian Miracle"]{.mark} to state-driven
industrial catch-up]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} while they were
successful in closing some of the gap, [these [countries never managed
to overtake the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike imitation,
which can be planned and coordinated, innovation is a voyage of
exploration into the unknown, to paraphrase the economist and
philosopher Friedrich von Hayek. [And switching from imitation to
innovation is hard: if it were easy, most countries would be innovating
at the technological frontier.]{.underline}

[By observing that [China is unlikely to overtake the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [in]{.mark} technological [innovation]{.mark}, we mean
in no way to downplay China's tremendous economic achievements since
Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978.]{.underline} China has plenty of
talent, but the fact remains that, so far[, [Chinese innovation]{.mark}
has mainly focused on incrementally improving [tech]{.mark}nologies that
were [conceived elsewhere]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese companies
currently lead the world in the development of 5G, for example, but
their work builds on several previous generations of telecommunications
technology. [What [Huawei demonstrates]{.mark} is [that China
has]{.mark} significant engineering [capabilities]{.mark}, just [like
Japan and]{.mark} indeed [the Soviet Union]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### 4. [No Global Hotspots Solvency]{.underline} --- NATO has [given up]{.underline} on out-of-area missions.

**Got 21** --- Antoine Got, Young Leader in Foreign and Security Policy
with the Global Fellowship Initiative at the Geneva Centre for Security
Policy (Switzerland), former Staff Officer in the Baltic Sea Region
Comprehensive Crisis and Operations Management Centre at the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (Belgium), former Staff Officer in
Crisis Response Systems and Exercises at NATO, 2021 ("Global NATO: What
Future for the Alliance's Out-of-area Efforts?," Geneva Centre for
Security Policy Strategic Security Analysis, Issue 18, December,
Available Online at https://dam.gcsp.ch/files/doc/ssa-18-december-2021,
Accessed 07-18-2022, p. 2)

Key Points

• [In recent years, the [out-of-area crisis-management
activities]{.mark} of]{.underline} the North Atlantic Treaty
Organisation ([NATO]{.underline}) [[have been **limited**]{.mark}
compared to the heyday of such endeavours in the]{.underline} 19[90s and
early 2000s.]{.underline} As the alliance prepares to unveil its next
Strategic Concept, questions have been raised over the future of its
out-of-area aspirations.

• Underpinning this is a debate framed, on the one hand, by calls for
NATO to revert to projecting more influence globally, while others argue
that the organisation should remain firmly anchored in the territorial
defence of its member nations, as seen since 2014 after Russia's
invasion of Crimea. It will be difficult for the next Strategic Concept
to reconcile these competing visions.

• However, this dichotomy is outdated in many ways. The (re)appearance
of great- and middle-power competition, the transnationalisation of
security challenges and transformations in the nature of warfare itself
are imposing new demands on NATO that in many ways will force the
organisation to look beyond its member nations' borders.

• [While existing out-of-area activities illustrate a desire not to
rescind NATO's role in the promotion of international -- as opposed to
strictly regional -- stability, [the alliance clearly remains hesitant
to reattempt ambitious crisis-management endeavours]{.mark} involving
large-scale troop deployments or combat operations abroad.
[After]{.mark} its experience in [**Afghanistan**, the threshold]{.mark}
for orchestrating military operations abroad [will likely remain
**high**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

• [This is unfortunate]{.underline}, because out-of-area crisis
management does not necessarily require large-scale, high-risk and
expensive foreign troop deployments, and a middle ground exists between
these types of deployments and the political costs of inaction. To
remain a prominent crisis-management actor, NATO must continue to apply
the wide array of non-Article 5 instruments at its disposal for the best
possible outcomes before, during and after conflict.

### Extend: "U.S. Wins Tech Race Now"

#### It's all political --- current weapons are enough 

**Sapolsky and Gholz 18** --- [Harvey M. Sapolsky]{.underline},
Professor Emeritus at MIT, the former Director of the MIT Security

**[The [complaints that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark}

process]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So are [[new]{.mark} government

are failing]{.mark} and need new initiatives. That is [how they gain
their budgets]{.mark}.]{.underline} And just as we have a thick
infrastructure to develop weapons, [we have also a thick network of
threat assessors worrying that we aren't worried enough]{.underline}

#### Allied open democracies are better for innovation than other forms of government.

Rob **Murray,** 9/1/20**20** (head of the Innovation Unit in NATO's
Emerging Security Challenges Division, "Building a resilient innovation
pipeline for the Alliance," Retrieved 6/12/2022 from

The reason is simple: [[the competition and creativity generated by
start-ups is good for the Allied defence ecosystem. Allied open
democracies and open educational models bring about levels of creativity
which other forms of government are unable to do. This maximises
disruptive innovation efforts and]{.underline}]{.mark}, as such, forces
incumbents (large companies) to compete with new, fresh thinking -- [[it
builds resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}.

**The U.S. is currently winning the AI race against China.**

The global competition between the United States and China continues
apace. **[[Technology is]{.underline}]{.mark}** rightly **[[seen as
providing unique leverage to win this geopolitical race]{.underline}.
[The U.S. long has been the global technology
powerhouse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but not surprisingly, we have heard
much about the Chinese government's [ambition to
dominate](https://www.csis.org/analysis/made-china-2025) high-tech
industries such as 5G telecommunications, autonomous vehicles,
blockchain, and semiconductor chips.  In this light, as a horizontal
technology that can be applied across all sectors, artificial
intelligence (AI) has become a strategic priority and the [Chinese
focus](https://www.afr.com/technology/is-china-winning-the-ai-race-20200805-p55imu) on
superiority in this field is touted as something about which the U.S.
should be concerned. [**[Some have gone so far as to conclude that [the
West has already lost the AI
race](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/why-china-will-win-the-global-battle-for-ai-dominance).
Don't believe the hype]{.mark}**.]{.underline} To be sure, [**[the
availability of large amounts of data is at the heart of AI
success]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is tempting to think that
less-democratic regimes that amass huge amounts of data about their
citizens and have scant regard for privacy can develop better AI systems
using that data. However, all other things being equal, better and
higher quality AI systems emerge from countries with strong data privacy
and data protection regulations because AI systems must undergo greater
scrutiny during their development and deployment. [An
example](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/innovation-spotlight-providing-adverse-action-notices-when-using-ai-ml-models/) of
this can be seen in the United States regarding fair lending practices
and consumer protection from credit bureaus. Further, the market for AI
is global, and such high-quality AI systems find buyers in other
countries as well. Around the globe, Big Tech's rising power has
resulted in calls for more oversight. In a drastic move that stunned the
industry and analysts alike, **[[the Chinese government [recently
rewrote](https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2021/11/08/xi-jinpings-crackdown-on-chinese-tech-firms-will-continue) the
rulebook for the country's technology industry.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
In effect, China is vacating entire swaths of digital and creative
industries, arenas that serve as training grounds and talent factories
for other industries. **[[This more restrictive approach may not bode
well for China's AI industry in the long term.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
China may find itself constrained on the extent of automation and AI in
its manufacturing sector --- labor-intensive manufacturing remains
China's main strength, and a high degree of automation can result in job
losses, labor unrest, and instability. Meanwhile, there is bipartisan
support for AI in the United States. Former [President
Trump](https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump) proposed [increasing
funding](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/482402-trump-budget-proposal-boosts-funding-for-artificial-intelligence-quantum) for
AI development through the National Science Foundation. The [National AI
Initiative
Act](https://www.congress.gov/116/crpt/hrpt617/CRPT-116hrpt617.pdf#page=1215) of
2020 signaled a sense of urgency and suggested that several federal
agencies create a national strategy on artificial intelligence[. **[The
Biden administration has formed the A]{.mark}**]{.underline}rtificial
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence **[[Research Resource Task
Force to develop a roadmap to foment AI research and spark innovation
nationwide.]{.underline} [There is draft legislation, at both the state
and federal level, to promote responsible use of AI and prevent its
misuse]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Strong objections to the use of facial
recognition and other AI systems by law enforcement in the U.S., raised
by civil liberties advocates, have led some local authorities, such as
the City of San Francisco, to [ban such
systems](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/business/facial-recognition-software-controversy.html?action=click&module=MoreInSection&pgtype=Article&region=Footer&contentCollection=Technology).
To use a Silicon Valley phrase, these debates are "not a bug, but a
feature." They shine a light on the limitations of AI systems and help
to set the "rules of the road" for proper use of AI. [[**This will
establish the U.S**. **as a global leader in AI**
]{.mark}**regulation**]{.underline}, once lawmakers and regulators do
their work. China, meanwhile, has faced strong [global
criticism](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/05/03/china-new-data-breach-exposes-facial-recognition-and-ethnicity-tracking-in-beijing/#5623644334a7) for

Uyghurs](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/technology/china-surveillance-artificial-intelligence-racial-profiling.html?module=inline.) in

principles](https://carnegieendowment.org/2022/01/04/china-s-new-ai-governance-initiatives-shouldn-t-be-ignored-pub-86127),
but the jury is still out on enforcement and how they function in
practice. The increasing number of AI research papers
and [patents](http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2021/12/22-Wake-Forest-J.-Bus.-Intell.-Prop.-L.-43.pdf) by
Chinese researchers is often cited as proof that China has caught up
with the United States in this field. The increased focus is good for
the Chinese AI ecosystem, and it will help them solve China-specific
problems. But dominance in this emerging strategic industry is not
guaranteed. [**[The U.S. has several strategic advantages, including:
the strengths of its higher education and research
institutes]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which attract the best STEM talent
from across the world; [**[the [largest venture capital

**[and the largest number of]{.underline}**]{.mark} technology unicorns

The current evidence and trajectory paint a clear picture: The
conditions for AI to flourish, such as incentives to experiment, freedom
to pursue opportunities without restrictions, and the coming guardrails
to prevent misuse, favor U.S. leadership. This is still the United
States's game to lose --- though maybe both countries could win through
collaboration. To solve planet-scale problems such as climate change, we
are going to need AI solutions from both competitors. 

#### Even if America were to share capabilities, allies still lags behind 

**Sapolsky and Gholz 18** --- [Harvey M. Sapolsky]{.underline},
Professor Emeritus at MIT, the former Director of the MIT Security
Studies Program, M.P.A. and Ph.D. in Political Economy and Government at

[[U.S. investment has created a thick infrastructure of
laboratories,]{.underline}]{.mark} test facilities, technology
[[**development centers**, and program analysis units]{.mark} that is
[unmatched]{.mark} anywhere]{.underline}. It includes government
agencies, universities, and firms, and it involves the efforts of
hundreds of thousands of individuals. It is an amazing system, devoted
entirely to developing better weapons, better ways of killing with
advanced technologies.

Three [[uniquely American factors drive the system]{.underline}]{.mark}.
First, there is [inter-service rivalry]{.underline}. [[Most nations have
a dominant service]{.underline}]{.mark}, their army or their navy,
determined by their geography. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, a
continent away from troubles, [has rivalrous services, each vying for
prominence and pushing for tech]{.mark}nologies that further its role as
America's best defender.]{.underline} Despite pledges of jointness, [we
have several armies]{.underline} (the Army, Marine Corps, Special
Operations)[, several air forces]{.underline} (the Air Force, Navy,
Army, Marine Corps), [and a Navy and a half]{.underline} (Coast Guard),
[and we have just added a Cyber Force and are talking about a Space
Force. Decentralization and competition spur innovation.]{.underline}

Another factor is the desire to avoid casualties. Surely people in all
countries love their children and wish to avoid having them killed in
wars, but [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} has done
something about it, perhaps because it fights mostly wars of choice, [is
very democratic, and [is very rich]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is surely
the drive behind our leadership in aviation, nuclear weapons and
precision weapons, drones, and robots. [[We are at the cutting edge of
tech]{.mark}nology [because we have to be.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Third, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is a nation of immigrants,
drawing talent from across the globe.]{.mark}]{.underline} Jewish
refugee scientists helped give U.S. nuclear weapons; German engineers,
our ballistic missiles. More recently, [[the Predator drone had
an]{.underline}]{.mark} Israeli [[immigrant father]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Yes, Silicon Valley and technology investors are impressive. But much of
what leads to very rapid success in the commercial sector has little to
do with defense. Many fast-growing companies, for example producers of
sports-related cellphone apps or new lifestyle concepts for food and
exercise, do not avoid defense work because they fear its bureaucratic
rules.

[In relevant technical areas, [there should be little fear that the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}]{.underline}tates [[won't set the
pace]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our major [defense contractors are skilled
systems]{.underline} integrators, used to brining complex technologies
together into viable weapon systems that can survive in difficult
battlefields great distances from our shores. Systems integrators have
two contracting faces, one to deal with complex government politics and
rules and the other to make commercial arrangements with "regular"
companies. They are skilled bridgers and brokers.

#### The US leads in the AI tech race now.

[[As nations vie for leadership, AI research output is increasing
rapidly]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to our analysis of journal
publications and conference papers tracked by the Dimensions database,
the global output for AI research grew from just over 52,000 globally in
2000 to roughly 403,000 in 2019, representing an increase of more than
600%. Now the most popular specialization among computer-science PhD
students in North America, AI is set to continue its steep, upward
trajectory. Rising revenues [[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[has historically been the leader in
AI-related research output]{.underline}]{.mark}, having accumulated the
highest number of publications over the past two decades. But China has
ramped up its output in recent years. In each year from 2016 to 2019,
China produced more AI-related papers than any other nation, according
to Dimensions. Over this period, China's output of AI-related research
increased by just over 120%, whereas output in the US increased by
almost 70%. In 2019, China published 102,161 AI-related papers, and the
US published 74,386. India, which came in third, published 23,398.
Publication numbers aren't the whole story, says Jeffrey Ding, a PhD
student at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford,
UK, who studies China's AI strategy. In the AI Index Report, which uses
citation numbers to measure the quality of AI papers, papers from China
were cited about 20% less than the world average in 2019, whereas papers
from the US were cited about 40% more than average. "Just pumping out
raw numbers of papers that don't have a lasting impact isn't really
useful," says Ding. "It's more important to keep up with the technology
frontier." A Nature Index analysis for this supplement looked at the
number of AI-related articles published in the 82 high-quality
natural-science journals tracked by the index, which primarily concern
the application of AI to research in the broad fields of chemistry, the
physical sciences, life sciences, and Earth and environmental sciences.
Between 2015 and 2019, the US was the leader, with the UK, Germany and
China in second, third and fourth place, respectively. But China has
increased its output in journals tracked by the index. Although it was
the fourth-most prolific country in the index in 2015, with roughly half
as many AI-related papers as Germany, China crept up over the next three
years, then leapt to second place in 2019, showing an increase of 340%.
The US, UK and Germany slightly more than doubled their output over the
same period. [[For the near future]{.underline}]{.mark}, Ding says,
[[**the US is likely to remain the world leader in AI.** "Though China
has some exceptional universities,]{.underline}]{.mark} such as Tsinghua
University, [[the US dominates in]{.underline}]{.mark} terms of maybe
[[the top 20 universities doing AI research]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
that is reflected in the quality of the papers. [[**It's very unlikely**
that China will become the singular innovation centre by
2030."]{.mark}]{.underline} Many countries see AI as providing a
competitive edge, not only economically, but militarily, says Husain. He
likens [[the competition in AI to the Space Race of the mid-twentieth
century,]{.underline}]{.mark} in which the US and the Soviet Union vied
to be the first to achieve milestones in space travel. "[[The Space Race
yielded contributions that differentiated the American
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[ecosystem from all others for
**decades to come**,]{.underline}]{.mark}" says Husain. "If a country
invests heavily in this area, it will yield technologies that will form
the pillar of defence capability and economic differentiation for the
rest of the century." [[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies [[that can be
developed based on AI will indeed have both economic and military
benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}, says Daniel Araya, a policy analyst at the
Center for International Governance Innovation, a think tank in Ontario,
Canada. "We're talking new weapons, data-driven innovation for industry
and automation, and redesigning how our society works from the ground
up." Husain points to Germany, which maintains a strong economy that
relies on exports of products such as machine parts and automobiles,
even though lower-income countries can provide low-wage labour for
manufacturing. Germany has been able to compete by using automation to
keep manufacturing costs down, while keeping quality and productivity
high. AI could reinforce this advantage by powering the next generation
of automation technologies. "Anybody that has mastery over this
technology and is investing in implementing it retains an economic
lead," says Husain. Institutions in Germany, such as the Fraunhofer
Society, Europe's largest application-oriented research organization,
have been emphasizing Industry 4.0, a national strategic initiative from
the German government to introduce more digital innovation and advanced
robotics into manufacturing and supply-chain management. In China, the
ability offered by AI systems to monitor public spaces and scan Internet
traffic in an effort to glean user intentions may provide the state with
improved tools for social control, enhancing its capability for
monitoring the population or censoring information. Even in countries
that don't officially track their populaces, facial-recognition
technology, such as that produced by New York-based company, Clearview
AI, is being used by law enforcement to identify suspects. The
technology has been met with deep concern by some researchers, who say
that biases built into its algorithms could result in ethical and human
rights abuses. Amid the controversy that surrounds certain applications
of AI, some groups are highlighting the good it can do. In 2019, the
Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, a scientific
society in Menlo Park, California, launched its Artificial Intelligence
for the Benefit of Humanity award, a US\$1-million prize funded by
Squirrel AI, an education technology company based in Shanghai, China.
The inaugural winner, Regina Barzilay from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, received the award in
September 2020 for developing a machine-learning algorithm that can
examine mammograms and predict which women are at a higher risk of
breast cancer. Barzilay has also developed a pattern-recognition
algorithm that predicts which molecules might make good candidates for
new medications. Publishing in the journal Cell, Barzilay and her
colleagues described how their system identified a molecule, dubbed
halicin, as a potentially potent new antibiotic (J. M. Stokes et al.
Cell 180, 688--702; 2020). When the molecule was synthesized and tested,
it was found to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Barzilay continues
to work on halicin and hopes to progress it to clinical trials. Money to
spend With an eye to the potential benefits of AI-based technologies,
the US National Science Foundation (NSF) announced in August 2020 that
it is establishing five new institutes focused on different topics, each
led by a different university, and each to receive \$20 million over
five years. One, led by the University of Oklahoma in Norman, will use
AI systems to improve climate forecasting accuracy. Another, at the
University of Texas at Austin, will focus on the next generation of
machine-learning algorithms. A third, led by the University of Colorado
Boulder, will apply AI technologies to teaching and learning. The
fourth, headed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will
explore the discovery and synthesis of new materials and drugs using AI
systems. And a fifth, led by MIT, will investigate how AI can improve
research in fundamental physics. The NSF has put out a call for
proposals for eight more AI institutes, which it plans to announce next
year. "We have a long history of supporting basic research in artificial
intelligence," says Erwin Gianchandani, the NSF's deputy assistant
director for computer and information science and engineering. In
addition, the US Department of Agriculture's National Institute of Food
and Agriculture has committed to funding another two institutes each
with \$20 million over five years to apply AI to questions of crop
yield, pest resistance and food distribution. Access to massive data
sets on which to train machine-learning systems is one advantage that
both the US and China have, says Araya. Europe, on the other hand, has
stringent data laws, which protect people's privacy, but limit its
resources for training AI algorithms. "So, it seems unlikely that Europe
will produce very sophisticated AI as a consequence," he says. "China is
at the opposite end of the spectrum, where it has few data protections,
and huge access to varied and diverse pieces of data." The NSF doesn't
make decisions based on global competition, says Rebecca Keiser, the
organization's first chief of research security strategy and policy. Her
position is designed to safeguard the security of federally funded
research, while promoting international collaborations. "We think of it
more in terms of the impact that our funding is going to have, rather
than from a nation perspective. The fact that it also contributes to US
global science leadership is fabulous," says Keiser. As for competing
against China in AI, she says, "We don't really know how much, and
where, they're investing, so it's hard to compete against that." With
funding from other major US agencies, including the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency and National Institutes of Health, [[the US
government expected to spend almost \$5 billion on unclassified AI
research in 2020]{.underline}]{.mark}. Other countries are investing,
too. The UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council gave
out nearly £160 million (US\$212 million) in 2020. The European
Commission, which has been supporting research through its Horizon 2020
programme, says public and private investment in AI should reach €20
billion (US\$23 billion) across Europe by the end of 2020. Even with
other countries placing emphasis on AI research, including Israel,
Japan, Singapore and Australia, the race comes down to China versus the
US, Araya says. The refinement of AI systems is driven not simply by
academic questions, but by applying the systems' intelligence to
practical problems. Countries will probably make advances by using AI in
areas where they already have expertise, says Ding, such as automation
in Germany or robotics in Japan. Having so many researchers around the
globe tackling all aspects of AI should advance the whole field, says
Keiser. "It's always good to have a bit of healthy competition."

### Extend: "AI Not Key To Military Power"

#### Agile bureaucracies, not the best technology, will win the global tech competition race.

[[Today, NATO's competition is a global one and the race is one of
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological [[adoption]{.mark}]{.underline} --
that is, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} acceptance, [[integration and use of
new technology in society. From a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence to quantum and everything in
between, [[governments are in a race to leverage these technologies at
scale and speed]{.underline}]{.mark} -- first adopter advantage for
emerging disruptive tech could not be more prevalent in the world of
geopolitics and deterrence. Indeed, [[the nations that win this race may
be those with the most agile bureaucracy rather those with the best
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology.

#### Technological innovation rarely influences the balance of power.

Michael C. **Horowitz, 2018** (Professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, "Artificial Intelligence, International Competition, and
the Balance of Power," Retrieved 6/11/2022 from
<https://tnsr.org/2018/05/artificial-intelligence-international-competition-and-the-balance-of-power/>)

[[**Decades of research** demonstrates that the impact of
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological change [[on global
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} --- whether it is change in economics,
society at large, diplomacy, or military power --- [[depends much more
on how governments]{.underline}]{.mark} and organizations [[make choices
about the adoption]{.underline}]{.mark} and use of new capabilities
[[than on the tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies
[[themselves]{.mark}.]{.underline}48 Scholarship on military innovation
by Barry Posen, Stephen P. Rosen, and others shows that
**[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological [[**innovation** alone **rarely
shapes the balance of power**]{.underline}]{.mark}.49 Instead, [[it is
how militaries use]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [[that makes a
difference]{.underline}]{.mark}.50 A military's ability to employ a
technology depends in part on the complexity of the technology, how
difficult it is to use, and whether it operates in predictable and
explainable ways. These factors influence the trust that senior military
leaders have in the technology and whether they use it.51 Additionally,
[[the more bureaucratically disruptive it is to adopt a
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology, [[the more challenging it can be for
older, more established organizations to do so]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
particularly if the organization is underinvested in research and
development designed to integrate new technologies and ideas.52

#### Competition for AI technology will be multilateral and not bilateral.

Michael C. **Horowitz, 2018** (Professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, "Artificial Intelligence, International Competition, and
the Balance of Power," Retrieved 6/11/2022 from
<https://tnsr.org/2018/05/artificial-intelligence-international-competition-and-the-balance-of-power/>)

[[The commercial drivers of AI technology, and the speed with which new
algorithms diffuse, would make competition much broader than it was
during the bilateral space race. **Competition is much more likely to be
multilateral**, featuring countries and companies around the world. A
better analogy might be to the competition surrounding the development
of Second Industrial Revolution technologies]{.underline}]{.mark} in the
late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[France, Germany, Britain, Japan,
the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[and
others vied for supremacy in steel production]{.mark}, chemicals,
petroleum, electricity, [and other areas]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### The AI technology itself is not key to military power---it is how it is used.

Michael C. **Horowitz, 2018** (Professor at the University of

the Balance of Power," Retrieved 6/11/2022 from
<https://tnsr.org/2018/05/artificial-intelligence-international-competition-and-the-balance-of-power/>)

Military and economic history suggests that the effect of narrow AI
could be quite large, even if suggestions of AI triggering a new
industrial revolution are overstated. Adoption capacity theory shows
that changes in relative military power become more likely in cases of
military innovations that require large organizational changes and the
adoption of new operational concepts. [[Even if the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[China, and
Russia were to end up with similar levels of basic AI capacity over the
next decade, the history of military innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}
from the phalanx to blitzkrieg [[suggests it is how they and others use
AI that will matter most for the future of military
power]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The Future of Transatlantic Cooperation

In addition to the effects [the [Afghanistan]{.mark} crisis might
have]{.underline} on Europe is the question of how it might change NATO
and transatlantic cooperation. Former UK prime minister Theresa May
[called for a "reassessment of how NATO operates,"]{.underline} echoing
President Macron's plea for reforming the transatlantic alliance.

[One likelihood is that this experience [will accelerate NATO's focus
**away from out-of-area crisis management**]{.mark} and toward
collective defense. [Even prior]{.mark} to the Afghanistan crisis,
[allies' political will]{.mark} to participate in costly, open-ended
missions outside of NATO's area of responsibility [was decreasing. Since
2014, NATO has **refocused on collective defense**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and several allies have simultaneously doubled down on national
security priorities]{.underline} (e.g., France on terrorism and Italy on
managing the consequences of illegal migration)[. As a result, [any
future out-of-area missions may have a **smaller footprint** and be
**low intensity**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Allies are]{.mark} also [likely to be **more discerning** about
**when** and **under what conditions** they join]{.mark}
operations]{.underline}, [particularly when they will be dependent on
U.S. assets.]{.underline} They may seek more specifics on the duration,
end-states, and exit plan of a mission; seek assurances in terms of
support; or demand a greater say in shaping or leading the mission. [A
sense of obligation or loyalty to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will **no longer be enough** to generate forces.
[This is **already perceptible** in Iraq]{.mark} where Europeans are
ready to take more responsibility in NATO's training mission on the
condition that Washington maintains some degree of military
backing]{.underline} (e.g., force protection, airlift, and
intelligence)[.]{.underline}

Finally, [[allies may gravitate toward **more agile coalitions of the
willing**.]{.mark} While NATO's consensus-based decisionmaking and
established force generation processes were once preferred because they
lent unity of purpose and staying power to a mission, [working through
NATO may now be viewed as]{.mark} at once [**more cumbersome** and
**less flexible**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[An important]{.mark} line of [action]{.mark} taken by NATO risks going
almost unnoticed because it is not clearly and explicitly included in
the Strategic Concept that the 30 leaders of NATO countries]{.underline}
have [just approved in Madrid.]{.underline}

[But it is implicitly included in the text of the document that will
guide transatlantic affairs over the next decade. It [is an initiative
to reinforce]{.mark} the defence organisation\'s commitment to science,
industry and [cutting-edge tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies[, a crucial
way [to maintain superiority in the face of]{.mark} the threat posed by
[Russia and]{.mark} the challenge from [China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

To prevent such a measure from being lost among the 49 paragraphs of the
document that defines the way forward for NATO, its Secretary General,
the Norwegian Jens Stoltenberg, wanted to bring his name to the fore at
the press conference that closed the first day of the summit of heads of
state and government held on 29 June in Madrid.

[The [NATO]{.mark} Council officially [endorsed]{.mark} the]{.underline}
so-called Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic
([[DIANA]{.underline}]{.mark})[. Its raison d\'être is to support the
creation in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[, Canada and
the European nations of the Alliance of a significant community of
public and private research teams, start-ups and test centres focused on
developing emerging dual-use tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline}

[As expressed in the Strategic Concept, the Allies are aware that
so-called deep and disruptive tech]{.underline}nologies [bring \"both
opportunities and risks\", that they \"alter\" the nature of conflicts,
that they are becoming increasingly strategically important and that
they are \"key\" in global competition between states. Thus, NATO
understands that \"tech]{.underline}nological [primacy is increasingly
influencing success on the battlefield\".]{.underline}

Artificial intelligence, the first priority

[What is the package of new future tech]{.underline}nologies [that the
Alliance is interested in pursuing? Seven were selected first and now
there are ten, the first of which is a]{.underline}rtificial
[i]{.underline}ntelligence[. NATO\'s top brass is concerned about
Beijing\'s significant investment in this new field of
tech]{.underline}nology, [so it is not surprising that it is high on the
Alliance\'s list of priorities.]{.underline}

[Next in importance are quantum tech]{.underline}nologies[; Big Data and
advanced computing; hypersonic tech]{.underline}nology[; bioengineering
and human capability enhancement; multiple space applications; novel
propulsion systems; new energy sources; innovative materials and
manufacturing processes; and autonomous land, naval and airborne
vehicles and weapons systems.]{.underline}

[[What is to be achieved is]{.underline}]{.mark} spelled out in
paragraph 24 of the newborn roadmap for the future NATO. It is [nothing
more than \"[promoting innovation and increasing investment in
e]{.mark}merging and [d]{.mark}isruptive
[t]{.mark}ech]{.underline}nologies [to maintain our interoperability and
military advantage\". It seeks to test, evaluate and validate new
tech]{.underline}nologies [that address critical defence challenges and
contribute to the Alliance\'s deterrence component.]{.underline}

[Among DIANA\'s objectives is to build and oversee an innovation
ecosystem of around 50 test centres to help emerging companies support
Alliance tech]{.underline}nology [needs through competitive grant
programmes.]{.underline} Specifically, [the]{.underline} new NATO
[roadmap aims to \"accelerate our digital transformation, adapt our
command structure to the information age and improve our cyber defence,
network and infrastructure capabilities\".]{.underline}

[NATO\'s Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security
Challenges]{.underline}, the Dutchman David [van Weel]{.underline}, [is
aware that \"innovation no longer comes from the defence sector as it
did until the end of the 20th century\". It comes from areas \"where we
are no longer present, so we have to reconnect\". The aim is to
strengthen transatlantic cooperation in critical
tech]{.underline}nologies [and to make a quantum leap forward with
respect to the Science for Peace and Security Programme]{.underline}
that the Alliance launched in 1958 and redefined in 2013[.]{.underline}

DIANA one site in the UK and one in Canada

[[More than 20 Allied nations have decided to pool resources and
invest]{.mark} around [1 billion euros over the next 15 years]{.mark} in
a venture capital fund dedicated to innovation]{.underline}, [with
grants of up to 200,000 euros. It is this group of nations that has
formed [the NATO Innovation Fund]{.mark}, the instrument that [will feed
DIANA]{.mark} with resources.]{.underline}

[The purpose of this multi-sovereign fund is to ensure that NATO
maintains its tech]{.underline}nological [edge over]{.underline} third
countries, namely [China and Russia. Each year, some 70 million will be
invested in exploring dual-use tech]{.underline}nologies [with direct
potential application in defence and security systems, equipment or
products.]{.underline}

[[the]{.mark} first-of-its-kind [fund will invest €1 billion]{.mark} in
startups and deep-tech funds [across 22]{.mark} participating
[nations]{.mark} over the next 15 years.]{.underline}

"Maintaining our technological edge has helped to keep our alliance
strong and our nations safe for more than 70 years. But today, nations
that do not share our values, like Russia and China, are challenging
that lead in everything from artificial intelligence to space
technologies," he said. "It is essential that we do everything in our
power to remain at the forefront of innovation and technology."

Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Turkey
and the U]{.underline}nited [K]{.underline}ingdom [all signed on to the

[The fund is meant to work alongside]{.underline} the Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic ([DIANA]{.underline}), mentioned in
the 2022 NATO Strategic Concept \[PDF\], [which brings together
governments, the private sector and]{.underline} academic
\[\[\[[academia]{.underline} --- fixed presumed typo\]\]\] [to bolster
its tech]{.underline}nological [edge.]{.underline}

[[DIANA will support the development of dual-use emerging
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies, [including AI and quantum-enabled
tech]{.underline}nologies[.]{.underline} During this week's summit,
[allied leaders pledged that innovators will be provided access to more

[DIANA "will support NATO's efforts to boost interoperability and ensure
that every Ally has access to cutting-edge tech]{.underline}nological
[solutions for military needs," according to a]{.underline} June 29
[White House fact sheet. "The U.S. will contribute by facilitating
access to U.S. entities]{.underline}, [such as test centers and
accelerator sites]{.underline}, [drawn from across the extensive and
diverse U.S. innovation sector."]{.underline}

[Also stated in the alliance's new concept]{.underline}, the first time
that document has been updated since 2010, [are plans to enhance
cybersecurity, an area that is "contested at all times." The concept
warns that a single or cumulative set of malicious cyber activities
could reach the level of armed attack.]{.underline}

"We recognise the applicability of international law and will promote
responsible behavior in cyberspace and space," according to the
strategy. "We will also boost the resilience of the space and cyber
capabilities upon which we defense for our collective defense and
security."

[[Leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} this week [[established a virtual rapid
response cyber capability]{.mark} to respond to malicious cyber
activities.]{.underline} The rapid response cyber capability was built
on lessons learned from the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the White House
stated. To that point, [[the US]{.mark} "[will offer robust national
capabilities as part of this support network.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

NATO has also decided on a "strengthened" package of support to Ukraine
meant to accelerate the delivery of non-lethal defense equipment,
improve its cyber defenses and support modernizing its defense sector,
the Madrid summit declaration states.

posed by China, which is a first.]{.underline}

[Despite the focus on Russia amid the ongoing war in
Ukraine]{.underline}, [[the Indo-Pacific has]{.mark} now [firmly entered
the NATO horizon. China's partnership with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline},
[together with Beijing's decision not to distance itself from Moscow
after the invasion]{.underline}, [have [played a key role in
**highlighting the linkages**]{.mark} between the European and
Indo-Pacific theaters. [This may lead to an **increased
presence**]{.mark} of individual NATO allies [in the
Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}, [in cooperation with regional
partners]{.underline}---an outcome that China had sought to prevent.

The China-Russia Factor

[[**All NATO allies** share a **growing concern** about China]{.mark}'s
geopolitical rise and power projection capabilities]{.underline}, [as
well as the impact that these may have on the rules-based international
order and the global balance of power.]{.underline}

Today, China is not only taking a central role in Indo-Pacific security
affairs, but it is also becoming an increasingly visible security actor
in Europe and its periphery. And Beijing's "strategic partnership" with
Russia, reaffirmed even in the face of Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
plays a key role in shaping many allies' threat perceptions. Joint
Sino-Russian military exercises in both Europe and East Asia over the
last few years have become a particular point of concern for nations in
both theaters.

NATO's role in confronting any security challenges posed by China in the
Euro-Atlantic area is evident. But what---if any---the alliance's role
in the Indo-Pacific should be has long been a contentious point.

Some NATO members, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and
France, maintain a regular military presence in the Indo-Pacific, while
others do not see the need to deploy to Asia now that Russia has
revealed itself as a clear and direct threat to Europe and/or do not
have the capabilities. But what seems clear is that the alliance will
not operate collectively in the Indo-Pacific any time soon. "There's no
way that NATO will move into the South China Sea," according to NATO
Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.

[How]{.underline}, then, [does the alliance plan to "stand up for our
shared values and the rules-based international order]{.underline},
[including freedom of navigation" in the face of China's "stated
ambitions and coercive policies"]{.underline}, [especially in the
Indo-Pacific?]{.underline}

Enter the Global Partners

[The answer is more about a **global approach** than a **global
presence**. And cooperation with NATO's global partners in the
Indo-Pacific region is a **central piece** of the puzzle.]{.underline}

[[The presence of the "**Asia-Pacific Four**" in Madrid is a step toward
this goal.]{.mark} It is also a clear sign that NATO allies and their
Indo-Pacific partners share the concerns over Russia and China's
behavior on the international stage.]{.underline}

While the security challenges that NATO allies face today are quite
different from those that partners in the Indo-Pacific must confront,
[[there seems to be]{.mark} a [realization on **both sides** that closer
coop]{.mark}eration [is the only way to effectively protect the
rules-based]{.mark} international [order.]{.mark}]{.underline} Asian
partners have condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine and have imposed
sanctions on Moscow in response. And in return, they seek to secure NATO
(including European) support for any potential conflicts in Asia.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida put it most plainly in Madrid, "I
feel a strong sense of crisis that Ukraine may be East Asia tomorrow."

Despite fears that the Western sanctions policy is bringing China and
Russia closer together, the fact is that [[**Sino-Russian alignment** is
also **unifying NATO** and moving Euro-Atlantic countries **closer
together** with]{.mark} their [allies]{.mark} and partners [in the
Indo-Pacific.]{.mark} Unintentionally]{.underline}, [Beijing and Moscow
have managed to **draw the linkages** between Euro-Atlantic and
Indo-Pacific security that they had long fought against.]{.underline}

#### 2. [Alliance Fragmentation Inevitable]{.underline} --- differing [threat perceptions]{.underline} and competing [national interests]{.underline} prevent closer NATO-Pacific alignment.

Mind the Divergences

[Despite this show of unity in Madrid]{.underline},
[however]{.underline}, [the newly forged [alignment]{.mark} on China
among NATO allies and with global partners [**should not be
overstated**.]{.mark} There may now be a common threat
perception]{.underline}, [but [when it comes to
responses]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[there is a **wide diversity** of
views]{.mark} and approaches.]{.underline}

[Within Europe]{.underline}, [[the perspective that]{.mark} systemic
[rivalry should be the dominant framework]{.mark} through which
relations with China are viewed [is **not fully shared**.]{.mark} And
[the US view]{.mark} of China as the "pacing threat" [has **many
opponents**]{.mark} within NATO]{.underline}, [especially in Central and
Eastern Europe]{.underline}, [for whom Russia is instead the main
challenge. Others]{.underline}, [like [Germany and
France]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[have **pushed back**]{.mark} against
attempts to lump together Russia and China]{.underline} (something
Chancellor Olaf Scholz' foreign policy advisor Jens Plötner warned
against publicly), [and to consider them as equal threats.]{.underline}

[[Divergences **also** exist **among**]{.mark} **NATO's [Indo-Pacific
partners]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[who have **very different** foreign
policies and views of China]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[as well as **their
own unique interests**]{.mark} in pursuing greater coordination with
NATO.]{.underline} Australia and Japan, both members of the Quad (the
others are the United States and India), are the most closely aligned
with Washington when it comes to relations with China, although they
have both emphasized the need to maintain stable ties with Beijing.

Attempts by the Chinese leadership to bring about a thaw in relations
with Australia after the election of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese
seem to be going nowhere, however, as Canberra has signaled a
continuation of the previous government's tough stance on China. Foreign
Minister Wang Yi's delivery of a list of demands to rebuild the
relationship---which included "regarding China as a partner rather than
a rival" and "not targeting any third party or being controlled by any
third party" (a clear reference to the US)---drew an immediate response
from Albanese who bluntly stated, "Australia doesn\'t respond to
demands."

And in Japan, Prime Minister Kishida Fumio has taken a harder stance on
China's activities in the region and continues to invest in Japan's
alliance with the US (which he has called the "cornerstone" of Japan's
security policy) in order to increase deterrence against China.

But while these two Quad members are seen in Beijing as being firmly on
the US camp, New Zealand and South Korea are a different story. Prime
Minister Jacinda Ardern's government has indicated that New Zealand has
no intention of joining any coalition targeting China. And the country's
close economic ties with China, alongside a longstanding principle of
maintaining an independent foreign policy, are likely to constrain any
potential shifts on China policy.

South Korea, meanwhile, sees China as less of a priority than North
Korea and its nuclear program or the protection of its economic
security. Newly elected President Yoon Suk-yeol has articulated a vision
for his country as a "global pivotal state" that will pursue a
values-based foreign policy, and he has announced that South Korea will
launch its own Indo-Pacific strategy by the end of this year. But while
Seoul is talking the talk, South Korea's \"pragmatic\" approach to
relations with Beijing, which seeks to avoid antagonizing China to
prevent economic retaliation, runs deep. Besides, the role of South
Korea-Japan tensions can't be underestimated: close cooperation on China
between Seoul and Tokyo still seems out of reach.

The Way Ahead

[**[Full alignment]{.mark}** on approaches to China (or Russia) within
NATO and with the alliance's Indo-Pacific partners [is **highly
unrealistic**. Not all]{.mark} countries [see China as an **equally
pressing** challenge. And]{.mark} even among those that do]{.underline},
[the [**policy prescriptions** vary]{.mark}]{.underline}, [ranging from
close alignment with the US as a deterrent against Chinese
aggression]{.underline}, [to attempts to maintain good relations with
Beijing in the hope of shaping its actions and encouraging China to
behave more responsibly.]{.underline}

#### 3. [Euro-Pacific Alignment Not Key To Counter China]{.underline} --- Asian partners are [sufficient]{.underline}, Europe's military [won't help]{.underline}, and Europe is [bogged down with Russia]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, [[**even though** the]{.mark} new [Strategic Concept sends
a strong signal]{.mark} of trans-Atlantic unity]{.underline}, [[it is
too early to conclude that it enables a joint and
well-coordinated]{.mark} U.S.-European [approach]{.mark} on China. [The
reason]{.mark} for caution [is **geography**.]{.mark} The U.S.-China
rivalry presents NATO with a different challenge than the U.S.-Soviet
one. During the Cold War,]{.underline} from its pivotal position in the
Eurasian heartland, [the Soviet Union constituted a threat to the entire
Eurasian rim]{.underline}, [from Europe all the way to the Far
East]{.underline}, [and it was a two-flank challenge to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[. Europe was the core area of
the Cold War strategic theater]{.underline}, [and this consolidated not
only a united threat perception among the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its European allies but also a common military
strategy. [China's]{.mark} geographic [position]{.mark}]{.underline},
[on the other hand]{.underline}, [**[does not preordain trans-Atlantic
unity]{.mark}** in a similar way.]{.underline}

[Moving from strategy to policy implementing the Strategic Concept, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and European NATO members will
find that the geopolitical logic of U.S.-China rivalry will shape a
new]{.underline}, [and not always easy]{.underline}, [trans-Atlantic
division of labor in three major ways.]{.underline}

First, [from its geographic position on the Asian rim facing the Pacific
Ocean, China represents a one-flank challenge to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[. [U.S. balancing]{.mark} of China [will]{.mark}
thus [be]{.mark} largely **[regional]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [focusing
on the Indo-Pacific with a lower priority for the trans-Atlantic
flank.]{.underline} In fact, the new U.S. National Defense Strategy
presented in March---after the Russian invasion of Ukraine had already
started---clearly states that priority will be given to deter the China
challenge in the Indo-Pacific. [One important outcome of the war in
Ukraine---and the consolidation of the European side of NATO with
Finland and Sweden as new members---is a more balanced burden-sharing
within NATO]{.underline}, [which allows the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to channel more resources to Asia over the long
term.]{.underline} Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the debate
had increasingly shifted toward putting Europe in a position to defend
itself. With Germany and other European countries committing to greater
defense expenditures in the wake of Russia's war, European defenses will
indeed be bolstered.

Secondly, [[balancing]{.mark} China in the Indo-Pacific theater [will
require the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[to lean more on]{.mark} Quad]{.underline}rilateral Security Dialogue
[members and other [Asian partners than on NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline} In
recent years, the larger European nations have eagerly deployed naval
vessels to sail in Asian waters, though some of these deployments have
been little more than symbolic. [[NATO is strengthening relations with
its]{.mark} formal [Asia-Pacific partners]{.mark}---Australia, Japan,
South Korea, and New Zealand---with an agreement to step up cooperation
in areas such as cybersecurity, other new tech]{.underline}nologies[,
and countering disinformation. Nevertheless, [it is]{.mark} still
[**nebulous** how]{.mark} exactly [European militaries will add
value]{.mark} to U.S. balancing efforts in Asia. [European navies have
been in **constant decline**]{.mark} since the end of the Cold
War]{.underline}, [whereas the Chinese navy has surpassed its U.S.
counterpart in terms of number of vessels. China is now building the
equivalent of the entire French Navy every four years.]{.underline}
Elbridge [Colby]{.underline}, co-founder of the Marathon Initiative,
[has suggested that it might serve the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [better to have Europe play to its strengths in the
Euro-Atlantic area, an opinion echoed by U.S. Defense
Secretary]{.underline} Lloyd [Austin.]{.underline} Commenting on the
British deployment of its new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, to
the Indo-Pacific region in 2021, Austin indicated that Britain is more
helpful closer to home than in Asia.

Finally, [due to its limited geographic reach across Eurasia, China will
remain a lesser threat to European security than Russia. With Russia an
openly belligerent threat for the foreseeable future, [European
resources will be **pinned down at home**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[impeding]{.mark} the implementation of [a joint trans-Atlantic
approach]{.mark} in the Far East.]{.underline} For instance, [NATO plans
to increase the strength of its rapid reaction force dedicated to the
defense of its Eastern European members nearly eightfold to 300,000
troops. Even though U.S. armed forces will remain engaged in Europe, the
bulk of NATO's increased presence along its Eastern European frontier
will have to be provided by European countries. And the [security
challenges in Europe's]{.mark} own [neighborhood are by no means limited
to Russia.]{.mark} At a time when the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is increasingly preoccupied in Asia, Europe faces
crumbling stability in the Middle East, North Africa and other regions
directly affecting Europe]{.underline}, [not least through potential
migration and refugee crises.]{.underline}

[[The Biden]{.mark} admin]{.underline}istration['s]{.underline}
long-awaited [Indo-Pacific [strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}, published on
February 11, [confirms]{.underline} what became evident in its first
year---[a clear shift of focus to the region and a push to strengthen
the collective capacities of US partners and allies there.]{.underline}
Coming almost five months after the announcement of the AUKUS security
pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States that
rattled most European countries, [the strategy [shows]{.mark} a clear
[effort to acknowledge the value an "engaged Europe" could bring to the
Indo-Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The document builds on the engagement of previous US administrations
with Asia and reflects a broad bipartisan consensus on the importance of
the Indo-Pacific as "vital for the security and prosperity" of the
United States. The goal is to work toward a free, open, connected,
secure, and resilient region by anchoring the United States more firmly
in it.

The strategy states clearly that a key driver of US engagement in the
Indo-Pacific is China's behavior. It asserts that the region faces
"mounting challenges, particularly from the PRC." It refers to China's
use of economic, diplomatic, military, and technological instruments as
it pursues a "sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific," often through
coercion and aggression. The strategy mentions economic coercion against
Australia, the conflict along the Line of Actual Control with India,
growing pressure on Taiwan, and tensions in the East and South China
Seas. Therefore, the US goal in the Indo-Pacific is not just to compete
with China, but to shape the strategic environment in which it operates
by building a "balance of influence."

Network of Partnerships

[The Biden]{.underline} administration's [strategy argues that
"investing at home" and "aligning approaches with allies and partners"
will allow the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to compete most
effectively with China. Given the changing strategic landscape and the
scale and scope of the challenges faced by the Indo-Pacific, any US
response will need to leverage partnerships in the region.]{.underline}
The strategy underlines that this is not just about US-China competition
or a unilateral US role in the region. In fact, the United States'
partners and allies "bear much of the cost of the PRC's harmful
behavior," and they have stakes and agency in how the region is shaped.

[The strategy therefore details how the US vision aligns with the
Indo-Pacific strategies of its most important partners]{.underline},
[including Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, the U]{.underline}nited
[K]{.underline}ingdom[, and]{.underline} the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations ([ASEAN]{.underline})[. In a nod to the EU's]{.underline}
recently released [Indo-Pacific strategy, the US document also notes
that,]{.underline} "[like France]{.underline}," [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [recognizes the "strategic value of an increasing
regional role for the E]{.underline}uropean
[U]{.underline}nion[."]{.underline}

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will
focus on]{.mark} building ["collective capacity"]{.mark} to deal with
challenges in the region [and]{.mark} on [fostering **interaction among
partners**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[**including between Asia and
Europe**.]{.mark} This would mean strengthening existing
alliances]{.underline}, [including with the likes Japan and South Korea,
investing in regional organizations, and building up the "latticework of
strong and mutually reinforcing coalitions]{.underline}, [including the
Quad"]{.underline} of Australia, India, Japan, and the United States.
[The utility of coalitions like the Quad]{.underline}, which allow
different countries to pool resources in a flexible manner, [is central
to US strategy in the region]{.underline}, as is investing in the
bilateral partnership with "a strong India."

Bridging the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic

[A lot of the points made in the Biden]{.underline} administration's
[strategy will not come as a surprise]{.underline} to observers of US
policy in the Indo-Pacific. [What is **new** is a **clear articulation**
of how the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [wants to work with
partners outside the region, particularly Europe. [One of the
goals]{.mark} in the strategy [is "**building bridges between the
Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic**."]{.mark} As the current
Russia-Ukraine crisis shows, this will not be an easy task.]{.underline}
It has led some to question how the United States' focus on the
Indo-Pacific can be sustained. The crisis has also highlighted the
challenge of dealing with an assertive Russia and an assertive China at
the same time. At least in the short term, the United States will need
to be a reliable partner in Asia and Europe simultaneously, including by
finding ways to link its partners there more closely. Japan's decision
to share surplus natural gas with Europe in the wake of the crisis is
just one example of how crucial such links are.

[[The]{.mark} new US Indo-Pacific [strategy]{.mark} contains the
beginning of this **bridge-building**. It not only stresses the
importance of European engagement in the region but also [encourages
**more interaction**]{.mark} among its Asian and European partners. The
good news for Washington is that [Europe has **already started
shifting**]{.mark} its regional focus away from China toward partners
like ASEAN, India, and Japan. Many in Europe have come to understand the
importance of flexible coalitions]{.underline}, [which the Biden
admin]{.underline}istration [has been emphasizing. Countries like
[France and Italy have instituted **trilateral dialogues**]{.mark} with
the likes of Australia, India, and Japan. [The]{.mark}]{.underline}
upcoming [[Indo-Pacific ministerial forum]{.underline}]{.mark} in Paris
[[will be a **major step**]{.mark} in sharpening the EU's strategy in
the region [and will see]{.mark} the announcement of **[concrete
projects]{.mark}** it will undertake there.]{.underline} While the
United States was not invited, its most important regional partners and
allies will participate. The inclusion of Australia in particular is an
important step in healing the rift caused by AUKUS.

[The priorities in the US and EU Indo-Pacific strategies also
**overlap**.]{.underline} For example, the United States aims at
promoting high-standards infrastructure and regional connectivity, and
the EU, with its Global Gateway plan, is an obvious partner with
resources and capacities to bring to the region. The EU and the United
States also focus on critical and emerging technologies as well as
"values-aligned technology standards." In the security sphere, the US
strategy includes civilian security challenges as well as building
maritime capacity and domain awareness, which are also the key thrust of
most European security engagement in the Indo-Pacific. The new US
strategy's call for "managing competition with China responsibly" while
offering a positive vision for the region will also strike a chord in
many European countries, which have taken a cautious approach toward
China.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
[[and]{.mark} the [EU have]{.mark} **already [instituted an Indo-Pacific
dialogue]{.mark}** to further explore these convergences. The bigger
challenge is to stitch together different conversations currently held
in various formats---from the Quad to the EU-US T]{.underline}rade and
[T]{.underline}echnology [C]{.underline}ouncil[---to drive outcomes,
offer public goods and alternatives, and avoid duplicating efforts in
the region.]{.underline}

#### Indo-Pacific cooperation with NATO strong now --- summit proves 

**Galic 22** --- Mirna Galic, senior policy analyst for China and East
Asia at the U.S. Institute of Peace, fellow of Foreign Relations-Hitachi
International Affairs at the Japan Institute of International Affairs,
served as a special advisor in the Executive Office of the
Secretary-General at the United Nations, 2022 ("Despite Ukraine Focus,

[Why are Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea being invited to
the NATO summit at the highest level?]{.underline}

NATO's endeavor to include its Asia-Pacific partners in the Madrid
Summit is part of a larger effort in recent years to streamline these
partners into NATO's structures and functions. [[Australia, Japan, New
Zealand and South Korea]{.mark} have been formal partners of NATO since
the early 2010s, part of a slate of "partners across the globe," but
they [are seen as an increasingly important]{.mark} subset of NATO's
global [partners]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is even an informal
nickname for these countries, the Asia-Pacific Four or AP4. [There are
[several]{.mark} key [reasons]{.mark} [for NATO's]{.mark} special
[interest]{.mark} in these partner countries]{.underline}.

[First is the character of the countries themselves]{.underline}. All
four are established democracies that share values with NATO allies, are
interested in mitigating international security threats, and have
sophisticated and capable militaries. Australia, Japan and South Korea
are also U.S. treaty allies, while New Zealand is a close U.S. partner.
There are a number of areas where cooperation and [[coordination between
NATO and the Asia-Pacific partners is mutually beneficial,
in]{.mark}cluding [e]{.mark}merging and [d]{.mark}isruptive
[t]{.mark}echnologies[, disinformation, cyber security]{.mark}, maritime
security, the rules-based international order and space.]{.underline}

[Second is the [growing importance of]{.mark} these partner countries'
broader region, [the Indo-Pacific]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Indo-Pacific
is one of the most dynamic regions in the world, and is expected to be
the driver of global economic and technological growth in the decades to
come[. It is also home to a great power, China, and this [takes on added
importance as strategic competition]{.mark} between the United States,
Russia and China [becomes]{.mark} increasingly [relevant]{.mark} on the
international stage.]{.underline} The significance of the Indo-Pacific
region and its impact on global affairs is increasingly realized not
only in the United States, but also in Europe.

[Third, and relatedly, is the [benefit]{.mark} to NATO [of having
interoperability]{.mark}, coordination [and info]{.mark}rmation sharing
[with]{.mark} countries embedded in the [Indo-Pacific]{.mark}
region]{.underline}, as well as the messaging and optics on unity this
provides. The Asia-Pacific partner countries have a long history of
living with China, balancing economic and security imperatives, pushing
back on violations of international law, deterring, and dealing with
coercive measures, all of which is immensely valuable insight for
European partners. Their intelligence and analysis regarding what is
happening in the region is likewise of great interest.

Perhaps most importantly, with the reemergence of great power conflict,
a strategic competitor sitting in each region, and an evolving
Russia-China relationship, there are many common strategic challenges
that European and Asia-Pacific partners are having to adapt to that
would be valuable for them to discuss together. These include, among
others, intermediate-range nuclear forces, missile defense,
inter-theater deterrence and defense, and how to push back on great
power use of force in contravention of international norms. The last is
certainly relevant to the Russian invasion of Ukraine but also has
parallels with China and Taiwan, which is why Ukraine is seen as more
than a European security issue.

Why do the leaders of Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea, in
turn, want to attend the NATO summit?

For many of the same reasons that NATO wants them to be there, not least
of all the need to adapt to common strategic challenges related to
changes in the international system. Just as NATO sees benefits to
engaging with partners in the [[Asia-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark} on
security issues, [Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea [see a
value to engaging with]{.mark} European partners]{.underline}.
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} gives them a convenient platform from which
to do that. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also [given many of these
countries a sense of vulnerability that European security dynamics have
not engendered in far-flung regions since the Cold War]{.underline}.
There is a clear cognizance that how the world reacts to Russia's use of
force against Ukraine will inform China's calculations in the region,
including on Taiwan. [[Attending]{.mark} a NATO [summit]{.mark} that
will heavily address Russia and Ukraine [is a way to project unity and
to manage]{.mark} the lessons that [China]{.mark} is learning from
Russia's actions and the international response [to
them]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One US official said Washington had pushed for Japan and the other three
nations to attend Nato as part of a strategy by President Joe Biden's
administration of building and expanding coalitions of like-minded
allies to counter China.

The US official said [[Japan wanted to expand and diversify its security
ties]{.mark} as an insurance policy to protect itself from
China]{.underline} in case the 2024 US election produced a president who
was weaker on the alliance with Tokyo. ["Japan is trying to build
capacity [outside of its relationship with the US,"]{.mark} he
said.]{.underline}

Christopher Johnstone, a Japan expert at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a US think-tank, said Kishida in particular felt
a keen sense of threat because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and
wanted Europe and Nato to be more attuned to the challenge from China.

[[Kishida]{.mark} had also [encouraged]{.mark} [British and
German]{.mark} naval [deployments to the Indo-Pacific]{.mark} over the
past year]{.underline}, said Johnstone, who until recently was in charge
of Japan policy at the National Security Council. "It fits a larger
pattern of diversifying relations," he said.

At the Madrid summit, Anthony Albanese, who was elected [[prime minister
of Australia]{.underline}]{.mark} in May, dismissed accusations that
Nato and its partners had constructed an "imaginary foe" in the form of
China.

Albanese [[pointed to Beijing's]{.mark} "no limits" partnership with
Russia and its [refusal to condemn the invasion of Ukraine.]{.mark}
"]{.underline}China must look at what is happening and look at the
resolve that is there from throughout the world and should be condemning
Russia's actions," he said.

[[South Korea's president]{.mark} Yoon Suk-Yeol]{.underline}, who made
his international debut at the summit, [[pledged]{.mark} his country
would play a bigger security role. "The co-operative [relationship
between]{.mark} South Korea and [Nato will become a cornerstone for
solidarity]{.mark}," Yoon said.]{.underline}

On the summit sidelines, Yoon met Kishida and Biden for the countries'
first trilateral meeting in nearly five years. The [[South Korean
leader used the occasion to signal willingness to repair ties with
Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} that have been badly strained by disputes
over historical issues and trade.

Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, concerns about how to contain
China's military ambitions had prompted a flurry of collective security
arrangements in Asia. [These include the Quad, which includes the US,
Japan, Australia and India, and the Aukus pact, under which the UK and
the US will help Australia acquire nuclear-powered
submarines]{.underline}.

Those [[multilateral security networks and existing bilateral defence
pacts have]{.mark} also [been complemented by]{.mark} regional
[economic]{.mark} [initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, unveiled recently by Biden.

### Extend: "Alliance Fragmentation Inevitable"

#### Closer Euro-Pacific alignment is [impossible]{.underline} because of [divergent security concerns]{.underline}.

Last week's North Atlantic Treaty Organization Summit was a landmark
event in trans-Atlantic relations, positioning Russia as the "most
significant and direct threat" to European security and agreeing to NATO
membership for Sweden and Finland, a previously almost unthinkable
outcome.

But [the Summit was]{.underline} also [significant for the Indo-Pacific:
the Alliance officially designated China as a "systemic challenge"
and]{.underline}, [for the first time]{.underline}, [all four NATO
partners from the Indo-Pacific attended: Australia, Japan, New Zealand,
and]{.underline} the Republic of [Korea.]{.underline}

NATO and its Indo-Pacific partners agree that we live in "a more
dangerous and unpredictable world", in the words of NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg. Most have already announced increases to their
defence budgets. Particularly noteworthy are Japan, which plans to
double its defence budget to 2 per cent of GDP, which would make it the
world's third largest; and Germany, which has dedicated a special fund
of EUR 100 billion (AUD 151.6 billion) to its armed forces. A
significant sum considering its annual defence budget is just half that.

The fact that these two aggressor-cum-pacifist states are rearming shows
just how different the world today is, even compared to a decade ago.

In 2010, NATO's Strategic Concept, which lays out how the Alliance
collectively assesses security challenges, China didn't warrant even a
passing reference. Cooperation with Russia was considered of "strategic
importance". It wasn't until 2019 that NATO first mentioned China. Then,
the Alliance spoke of the "opportunities and challenges" presented by
China's growing influence. Just two years later, the word
"opportunities" had been dropped.

It might be tempting to see this change as solely influenced by the
United States, which has identified China as "the most serious long-term
challenge to the international order". In reality, China only has itself
to blame for "losing" Europe. Russia's invasion of Ukraine immediately
following China's declaration of a "no limits" friendship with Russia
deeply worries Europe, as does China's continued diplomatic support of
Russia.

But a cooling of relations has been evident for some time. The EU has
long been concerned about China's abysmal human rights record, is
dissatisfied with Hong Kong's "authoritarian turn", has rallied against
what it describes as China's "discriminatory trade practices", and has
been angered over counter-sanctions applied to some its
Parliamentarians, which froze the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on
Investment.

[NATO members and their Indo-Pacific partners]{.underline} thus
[increasingly agree on where threats to the global order come from. In
this year's Strategic Concept, NATO warns that China's "stated ambitions
and coercive policies challenge \[NATO's\] interests, security and
values".]{.underline}

**[Still]{.underline}**, [[while]{.mark} the [strategic
convergence]{.mark} across many in the Euro-Atlantic and its
Indo-Pacific partners [is here to stay, **we should not confuse it with
complete overlap**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Japan and Germany are]{.mark} both [increasing]{.mark} their [defence
budgets]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but they do so [with different
adversaries in mind. While NATO is keeping an eye on China,]{.mark}
Stoltenberg has made clear [the Alliance **does not see it as an
adversary**]{.mark} for the defence pact. China is mainly seen through a
Russia lens]{.underline}, [with NATO taking aim at their "deepening
strategic partnership".]{.underline}

[The reverse is also true. While they are rallying behind Ukraine to
defend international norms, NATO's [Indo-Pacific partners are **sharply
focused** on]{.mark} the possible precedent Russia's brutal invasion
might set in [Asia]{.mark}]{.underline} (though New Zealand resists this
characterisation). [Japan has been a strong supporter of Ukraine,
warning that "Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow". Australia has
proudly proclaimed to be Ukraine's largest non-NATO supporter,
cautioning China to take lessons from Russia's pariah
status.]{.underline}

[Beyond NATO, the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [views China
as a "systemic rival" and economic competitor]{.underline}, [but [the
EU's]{.mark} Indo-Pacific [strategy is **less about balancing China's
power**]{.mark} in the region [and more about amplifying EU
engagement]{.mark} with]{.underline}, [and influence in]{.underline},
[Asia.]{.underline}

[[Nor]{.underline}]{.mark}, [despite growing concern about
China]{.underline}, [[is there consensus across EU member states]{.mark}
on how best to meet the challenge. While some]{.underline}, [like
[**Hungary** and **Greece**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[are still seeking
closer economic coop]{.mark}eration while keeping the security dimension
separate, others]{.underline}, [like [**Sweden** and
**Lithuania**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[are]{.mark} increasingly [looking
to limit Chinese presence]{.mark} and influence, seeing the relationship
through a security lens.]{.underline}

[These [differences were on display during]{.mark} **the [negotiations
for the Strategic Concept]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} [The
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}**ingdom
[[pressed for a **more forceful tone**]{.mark} on China [alongside **the
U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, [[while
**France** and **Germany**]{.underline}]{.mark}, where for some the idea
of Wandel Durch Handel (change through trade) remains alive and where
China plays an important role in the vital car industry, [[wanted to
**tone down language**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[In the end]{.underline}, [NATO not only included a reference to the
China "challenge"]{.underline}, [but also noted that it hoped for
"constructive engagement" on building transparency. Only time will tell
whether this is realistic or will seem just as outdated]{.underline},
[if not naïve]{.underline}, [as the idea of NATO cooperation with Russia
appears today.]{.underline}

[For NATO's Indo-Pacific partners,]{.underline} including Australia, [a
united Euro-Atlantic and willingness to push back against the
China-Russia entente is positive. So too is greater European engagement
in Asia. **Even so**, the task of [building]{.mark} a favourable
[balance of power]{.mark} in the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}, or what
Australia's new Foreign Minister, Penny Wong, calls a "strategic
equilibrium", [[largely will remain **the work of the
U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[and
its]{.mark} close [Indo-Pacific
partners]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[NATO's Asia-Pacific partner countries---Australia, Japan, New Zealand,
and]{.underline} the Republic of [Korea---are easily among the
Alliance's most undervalued assets.]{.underline} All four are
established democracies that share NATO's values and have contributed to
NATO initiatives. Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Australia are also
US treaty partners and boast some of the world's most sophisticated
militaries---outmatching those of the vast majority of NATO
allies---according to global military rankings. [Although NATO and these
partners have developed their relations over the past two decades,
**various [constraints]{.mark}** [have **limited**]{.mark} **the
[ambition and potential]{.mark}** of these relationships.]{.underline} A
recent report from a group of experts, charged by NATO Secretary General
Jens Stoltenberg with identifying ways to strengthen the Alliance for
the future, could lead to a change in this status quo.

The report calls on NATO to devote increased attention and resources to
the security challenges posed by China---a relatively new focus for the
Alliance---in part through deepened consultation and cooperation with
its Asia-Pacific partner countries. Engagement between NATO and these
partners on China is certainly important, but the increased attention
paid in this context toward the Asia-Pacific partners also serves as an
opportunity for both NATO and these countries to assess---and where
possible address---the constraints that have thus far limited their
relations. Doing so would enable NATO and its Asia-Pacific partners to
maximize the potential of these partnerships going forward---both in
regard to China and more broadly.

[The constraints from NATO's side include [its **partnership
program**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which [poses particular
challenges]{.mark} for the Asia-Pacific partners. These partners belong
to a catch-all "Global Partners" designation]{.underline} created for
countries falling outside of NATO's formalized, regionally based
partnership categories: Partnership for Peace, Mediterranean Dialogue,
and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative. [[NATO has not made space for
**meaningfully engaging**]{.mark} Global Partners in the partnership
activities that it offers]{.underline}, which are geared toward the
needs and interests of the countries in these formalized partnership
categories. [[Most]{.mark} partnership activities [are]{.mark} also
**held [in Europe]{.mark}**, limiting their accessibility to countries
in the Asia-Pacific.]{.underline} Increasing resources for NATO's
partnership program, as recommended in the expert-group report, could
help with these problems, but first the problems must be recognized and
solutions to address them prioritized.

[NATO [**military exercises** present a similar issue]{.mark}; although
many are open to Global Partners, they are also largely held in Europe.
Expanding formal NATO military exercises to other geographic areas more
readily accessible to Asia-Pacific partners]{.underline}---like the
Indian Ocean---[would require endorsement by the **NATO Military
Committee** and approval by the **N**]{.underline}orth
**[A]{.underline}**tlantic **[C]{.underline}**ouncil[. Such hurdles have
thus far been **too high** for an organization whose decisions are made
on the basis of **consensus** among thirty countries.]{.underline} A
less formal option, such as a smaller, ally-led exercise under a NATO
flag, would still require Military Committee approval but presents a
somewhat lower bar to entry. More feasible still may be sending NATO
observers to exercises held by Asia-Pacific partners. Such an option may
provide a useful starting point from which to build momentum for
addressing the accessibility aspect of military exercises more
thoroughly.

[The hurdle of **consensus** for military exercises highlights a deeper
problem for relations between NATO and its Asia-Pacific partners.
Despite NATO's outreach to and articulated support for these
partners]{.underline}, [and despite general acknowledgement of the
significance of the broader region in which they are
located]{.underline}, [[there has been **no agreement among allies** on
the **priority** of the Asia-Pacific]{.mark} Global [Partners]{.mark}
for NATO.]{.underline} That's the case even though these countries make
up the largest regional group within the Global Partners category. [NATO
[allies have been **split on their level of ambition**]{.mark} vis-à-vis
the Global Partners **[writ large]{.mark}** since the category
emerged]{.underline}, [with divisions breaking along intra-Alliance
fault lines between more globally oriented allies]{.underline}, [like
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and those favoring NATO's
traditional transatlantic character]{.underline}, [like
France.]{.underline} Russia's 2014 invasion of Ukraine, which
underscored the continued importance of European territorial defense,
added to the divisions among allies regarding Global Partners. If the
emphasis on Asia-Pacific partner countries in the expert-group report is
to find fertile ground rather than bumping up against these obstacles,
it may be necessary to lay additional political groundwork within NATO.

[The **lack of consensus** within NATO on the Asia-Pacific partners has
also hampered the Alliance's ability to craft a **strategic approach**
to these partnerships, resulting in a largely tactical one
instead.]{.underline} NATO has established the administrative and
political frameworks necessary to formalize its "bilateral" relationship
with each of the Asia-Pacific partners, including by finalizing
Individual Partnership and Cooperation Programme agreements, approving
national staff contributions to NATO headquarters and satellite
installations, and facilitating exchanges of visits between high-level
officials. The Alliance and its Asia-Pacific partners have also
undertaken operational cooperation on issues like piracy and the war in
Afghanistan. [NATO has made **uneven progress**]{.underline}, however,
[in deepening and further developing the potential of its individual
relationships with these countries]{.underline}, [which have progressed
largely on an **ad-hoc** basis. The Alliance has also lacked a strategy
for harnessing the potential of the Asia-Pacific partners as a
group]{.underline}, [instead favoring a hub-and-spokes
approach.]{.underline}

[NATO is not alone in these shortcomings; the [Asia-Pacific
partners]{.mark} all [have]{.mark} various **[individual
constraints]{.mark}** on their relations with NATO.]{.underline} In a
recent paper for the Japan Institute of International Affairs, I discuss
examples from Japan-NATO relations. Although further research on the
other partners is warranted, [some of the basic issues facing
Japan---[**personnel shortages**, **competing priorities**, and]{.mark}
only [a **nascent strategic vision**]{.mark} for relations with
NATO---[are mirrored]{.mark} in other Asia-Pacific partner countries.
The Asia-Pacific [partners have]{.mark} also [failed to take]{.mark}
adequate [advantage of **coordination**]{.mark} with one another as a
tool for advocacy with NATO.]{.underline} Such coordination could
amplify a regional voice in NATO and be a more effective method of
championing issues and activities relevant to the region than the
efforts of any single country. [The partners]{.underline}, however,
[would first need to determine jointly any shared goals and interests
regarding NATO]{.underline}, [as well as potential areas of
contention.]{.underline}

#### E.U won't follow on because of strategic autonomy

Rebalancing European and trans-Atlantic defense," Brookings Institute,

[The term ["strategic autonomy,"]{.mark} popular in some European
circles and anathema in others]{.underline}, stems originally from an
earlier discourse within the French strategic community [[to
describe]{.mark} France's [ambition to boost]{.mark} its military
[capabilities and reduce its dependencies so that it could act alone if
necessary to protect]{.mark} French [interests]{.mark},]{.underline}
beginning with crisis management operations in Africa and along Europe's
southern periphery. Of course, the European Union (EU) has been trying
to develop its capacity for military action for some decades. [Yet it
was [only in 2016 that the "strategic autonomy" term was lifted to the
EU level]{.mark}, with the publication of the bloc's Global
Strategy]{.underline}. The document "nurtures the ambition of strategic
autonomy for the European Union," but does not define the notion's
content or its implications.\[2\]

[In the years that followed[, the term gained traction]{.mark} in some
EU countries [as concerns]{.mark} in Europe [mounted about U.S.
reliability]{.mark} as an ally under President Donald Trump,
[China's]{.mark} rising technological and norm-setting
[challenges]{.mark}, and signs that the EU could be trampled as the
American and Chinese elephants collided]{.underline}. Debate was
[f[urther energized by signs of faltering European tech]{.mark}nological
[prowess]{.mark},]{.underline} and especially by the COVID-19 pandemic,
which exposed European dependencies across a number of health-related
sectors.

Over time, the term began to assume a far more expansive meaning.
European concerns have spawned a raft of related phrases, such as
"European sovereignty," "economic sovereignty," "health sovereignty,"
"technological sovereignty," "data sovereignty," "cybersecurity
sovereignty," even "digital strategic autonomy." The result, as one
European observer noted, is a "muddle of words."

European commentators and leaders cloud things further by interpreting
these assorted phrases very differently, according to their diverse
strategic cultures, threat perceptions, and calculations of
self-interest.

Taken together, however, this jumble conveys a shared and deeply-felt
anxiety among many Europeans that their grand experiment of integration
is being imperiled by internal weaknesses and external forces. In all of
its forms, [[the autonomy narrative is meant to generate EU-wide
consensus behind]{.mark} ambitious and often-costly [initiatives to
bolster the bloc's]{.mark} technological, industrial, and norm-setting
capabilities [in way]{.mark}s that their proponents believe can preserve
European competitiveness]{.underline}, [[lower strategic
dependencies,]{.mark} raise the EU's ability to resist geopolitical or
geoeconomic coercion, and give it more freedom to maneuver and shape its
environment.]{.underline}

### Extend: "Euro-Pacific Alignment Not Key"

#### European allies [can't help]{.underline} the U.S. counter China.

[So what does NATO plan on doing in the Asia-Pacific?]{.underline} If
[[Euro]{.mark}pean alliance [members]{.mark}]{.underline} still are not
serious about their defense from Moscow, they [[aren't likely to
confront a]{.underline}]{.mark}n even [more formidable [power
**thousands of miles away**]{.mark}]{.underline}, one [[with which
many]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[have **significant economic
ties**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[They do know the **talk**, however.]{.underline} The NATO 2022
Strategic Concept released in Madrid devoted two paragraphs to China.
The first complained that the PRC's "stated ambitions and coercive
policies challenge our interests, security and values." China was
accused of conducting "malicious hybrid and cyber operations," seeking
"to control key technological and industrial sectors, critical
infrastructure, and strategic materials and supply chains, using "its
economic leverage to create strategic dependencies and enhance its
influence," and subverting "the rules-based international order,
including in the space, cyber and maritime domains."

Moreover, "the deepening strategic partnership between the People's
Republic of China and the Russian Federation and their mutually
reinforcing attempts to undercut the rules-based international order run
counter to our values and interests."

The second paragraph detailed NATO's response to Beijing's activities.
Although open "to constructive engagement," members stated that they
"will work together responsibly, as Allies, to address the systemic
challenges posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security and ensure NATO's
enduring ability to guarantee the defense and security of Allies. We
will boost our shared awareness, enhance our resilience and
preparedness, and protect against the PRC's coercive tactics and efforts
to divide the Alliance. We will stand up for our shared values and the
rules based international order, including freedom of navigation."

[Nowhere did the 11-page statement explain **how** NATO would
**achieve** these objectives after members' awareness was suitably
boosted. [**No action steps were included**.]{.mark} The political
leaders of [Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea]{.mark}
attended]{.underline}, [but [received **no promises of practical
military support**]{.mark} if conflict erupted with China.]{.underline}
Indeed, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol rushed to assure the PRC
that the summit was "not about excluding a certain country."

Nevertheless, NATO's Pacific diversion did get Beijing's attention. And
China's response was sharp: "Nato's so-called Strategic Concept, filled
with cold war thinking and ideological bias, is maliciously attacking
and smearing China. We firmly oppose it." The PRC went on to warn: "When
it comes to acts that undermine China's interests, we will make firm and
strong responses."

[[**Beijing needn't worry**.]{.mark} Other than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, **[[only France and the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[K]{.underline}]{.mark}**ingdom [[can
credibly claim to have some combat capability]{.mark} in the region.
[Efforts by other members]{.mark} to exhibit military reach [have been
**pathetic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, enough to irritate China, but little
more. [[What Euro]{.mark}pean [government is going to invest
substantially in its navy and create an expeditionary
army]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with airpower]{.mark} to
match]{.underline}, [[to fight the PRC]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[when]{.mark} further [investments are **desperately needed in
Europe?**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Again, [consider the state of the UK military, one of Europe's
best.]{.underline} Reported the Times of London: "[The most likely war
British soldiers face now is in Estonia, a 24-hour, 1,500-mile journey.
Our ability to move large quantities of equipment and supplies across
such distances is untested even in peacetime. When our conventional
munitions run out, only the overstretched Americans]{.underline}, [or
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [stand between us and defeat. If Russia
can survive the first week, it wins.]{.underline}"

**[And the UK plans to take on the PRC too?]{.underline}**

[Asian and European democracies can cooperate against China in important
areas]{.underline}: promoting human rights, deterring cyber-attacks,
diversifying supply chains, addressing trade abuses, and rebuffing
economic coercion. Although the Strategic Concept mentions enhancing
NATO-European Union cooperation to address "the systemic challenges
posed by the PRC to Euro-Atlantic security," [European governments and
the EU, not NATO, should be the starting point on these issues for
friendly Asian states.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} transatlantic [alliance should focus on expanding
Europeans' capacity to defend themselves from Russia.]{.mark} If they
ever complete that process, then they could add Beijing to their
potential adversary list. [Until then they should **stop pretending to
be Asia-Pacific powers**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
