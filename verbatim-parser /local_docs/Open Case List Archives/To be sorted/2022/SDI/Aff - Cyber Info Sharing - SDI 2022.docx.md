[Info]{.underline}rmation [sharing has become]{.underline} such
[an]{.underline} overused but **[under-performing]{.underline}**
[concept]{.underline} that the term tends to provoke eye rolls within
the cyber security community. Yet, [most practitioners and [policymakers
agree]{.mark} that better [info]{.mark}rmation [sharing would **improve
defences** against]{.mark} **rapidly [evolving cyber
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Virtually
**[[every]{.underline}]{.mark}** relevant [panel, [study]{.mark}, or
review over the last 20 years [has recommended **increased**]{.mark}
**information [sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as a]{.underline} **[key
step]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [improving [cyber security.
The]{.mark} logical [question is]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[why]{.mark}
information [sharing has not increased]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [Its
lack remains a **barrier**]{.underline} [to]{.underline}]{.mark} [better
[cyber security]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether [[within
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} or the broader digital ecosystem.

This chapter will identify three faulty assumptions that have prevented
cyber threat information sharing from living up to its promise that
cyber threat information consists primarily of technical data, that
every organisation should consume this technical data, and that
information sharing is easy. It then establishes a framework for
updating the current approach to information sharing by distinguishing
the characteristics and value of different threat information types,
using relevance and comparative advantage as the basis for producing and
consuming threat intelligence, addressing key barriers to information
sharing, and identifying trust as a necessary component of effective
information sharing. Finally, the chapter explores the implications of
these changed assumptions for more effective information sharing,
including within NATO's information sharing ecosystem.

A. Technical Level Cyber Threat Information Sharing in NATO [[NATO
adopted **technical** cyber threat info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation
[[sharing]{.mark} early on through an instance of the open-source
Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)]{.underline} (NATO, 2013;
MISP, 2020a), [which the Alliance leverages to privately share
information with member states, industry partners, and national Computer
Emergency Response Teams (CERT) (]{.underline}Schrooyen, 2017). [NATO
uses MISP for the exchange of classified technical information with
tactical and operational value and information [sharing]{.mark} with
participating partners is filtered [according to its classification
level]{.mark}]{.underline} (Schrooyen, 2017). [Using MISP
**only**]{.underline} [for classified technical info]{.underline}rmation
[sharing]{.underline} [[**limits its value** because it
restricts]{.mark} the number of potential [partners]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[and excludes]{.underline}**]{.mark} other [[**valuable** types of
strategic and operational info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline}.
**[[Over-classification impedes]{.mark} info]{.underline}**rmation
**[[sharing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [something which NATO has
acknowledged]{.underline} (NATO, 2012).

NATO also maintains a best practice and threat information sharing
relationship with EU-CERT (NATO, 2016) and is building an Industry Cyber
Partnership (NICP) (NATO, 2020). These two programmes provide NATO with
the foundation needed to meet the challenges of information sharing
explored in this chapter. Key industry partners include Oracle (NATO,
2019a), RSA Security (NATO, 2017), FireEye (Fireye, 2016), Cisco (NATO,
2016), CY4GATE, Thales, Vodafone (NATO, 2018), BT, Minded Security,
Lockheed-Martin, Fortinet, and Symantec (Schrooyen, 2017). The NICP has
broad goals, including improvements to the sharing of best practices,
expertise, experience, and information 'including \[...\] on threats and
vulnerabilities' (NATO, 2020).

In parallel, the Alliance's efforts to operationalise a Cyber Security
Collaboration Hub by 2023 (NATO, 2019b), which will allow member states
'to quickly and securely share information with each other, and with the
\[Alliance\]' (NATO, 2019c), could address some of the challenges raised
in this chapter. However, this chapter argues that [[NATO should **shift
its approach**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to info]{.underline}rmation
[sharing]{.underline} [to assume a]{.underline} **[leadership position
in this area.]{.underline}**

2\. FAULTY ASSUMPTIONS: OVERPROMISING AND UNDERACHIEVING

[Underlying the slow progress on info]{.underline}rmation [sharing are
**three faulty underlying assumptions**]{.underline}: [(1) cyber threat
info]{.underline}rmation [consists primarily of technical data; (2)
every organisation should be producing and consuming technical cyber
info]{.underline}rmation; [and (3) sharing cyber threat information is
easy]{.underline}.1 These fallacies are implicit, rather than explicit,
and so have largely avoided critical review or academic assessment.
Further, they have resulted in counter-productive policy, misaligned
incentives, and ineffective cyber security. To address these
shortcomings, different foundational assumptions are needed. In turn,
using better assumptions can make information sharing a more effective
tool against cyber threats.

[**A. C**yber **T**hreat **I**nformation Consists Primarily of
**Technical Data**]{.underline}

Within the cyber security community, [the term 'information sharing'
primarily refers to the exchange of technical data that identifies
malicious activity]{.underline} such as malware and malicious domain
names. While several scholars (Friedman et al., 2015; Chismon & Ruks,
2015) acknowledge that such exchanges should also include other types of
information, the emphasis is on technical data in practice. For example,
the main use cases or core functionalities associated, respectively,
with the two commonly used cyber information sharing standards,
Structured Threat Intelligence eXchange (STIX) and the Malware
Information Sharing Platform (MISP), focus on technical information
(MITRE, 2012; MISP, 2020b). [**[C]{.mark}**yber **[t]{.mark}**hreat
**[i]{.mark}**nformation [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} 'primarily
[[focus\[es\] on]{.mark} sharing of **[indicators of
compromise']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sauerwein et al., 2017: p. 838),
[[leading to a situation in which]{.mark} the [activities of]{.mark}
almost [every]{.mark} established [sharing platform are '**comparable to
data warehousing'**]{.mark}]{.underline} (ibid: p. 849).
[Many]{.underline} [**[US]{.mark} government [programmes]{.mark}** and
existing statutes either **[explicitly]{.mark} or implicitly** [focus on
**this type** of info]{.mark}rmation [sharing]{.mark}; meanwhile,
companies are investing billions of dollars in an effort to consume and
analyse technical cyber threat information]{.underline} (Verified Market
Research, 2020).2

[[The assumption that cyber threat info]{.underline}]{.mark}rmation
[[is]{.mark} equivalent or primarily [composed of technical
data]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[severely limits]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} potential [[value of]{.mark}
info]{.underline}rmation [[sharing. Technical data]{.mark}, while
necessary, [is not the only form of info]{.mark}]{.underline}rmation
[that can provide value. For example, [a warning]{.mark} from
the]{.underline} US Federal Bureau of Investigation [(FBI) [that]{.mark}
a specific Chinese [cyber group is targeting a]{.mark} US [company with
cyber]{.mark}-enabled [theft]{.mark}]{.underline} of intellectual
property [[would be a useful piece of **non-technical
intelligence**]{.underline}]{.mark} for that company. [Written
advisories about vulnerabilities and associated patches are critical to
organisations using vulnerable software or hardware]{.underline}; in
fact, [[such info]{.mark}rmation [is **far more useful**]{.mark} to most
organisations [than technical data]{.mark} on]{.underline} one of [the
many variations of the LockerGoGo malware. [The]{.mark} most [common
interpretation of info]{.mark}rmation [is **too
narrow.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[B. Every Organisation]{.underline}** Should Produce and **[Consume
Technical Data]{.underline}**

If the underlying assumption is that information sharing means technical
information, then it logically follows that [most policies]{.underline},
infrastructure, and programmes [for sharing are built around the idea
that]{.underline} most [organisations]{.underline} should [produce and
consume **technical information**]{.underline}. If everyone were to
collect, share, and consume such data, the thinking goes, security would
improve across the ecosystem[. The problem with this logic is that [most
organisations are **lousy** at]{.mark} collecting, producing, and
[consuming technical data]{.mark}]{.underline}[---**[and always will
be]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Most companies **do not have the
capability** to identify a malware binary, analyse it, and use the
resulting information, nor would they know how to]{.underline} handle a
malicious domain name. As a practical matter, [this situation will **not
change**]{.underline}; [**[no country]{.underline}** [will have enough
cyber security professionals]{.underline}]{.mark} [for every
organisation to have this capacity]{.underline}. **[Small and medium
businesses]{.underline}** [do not and will not have the resources
[to]{.mark} collect, [process]{.mark}, share, and consume [technical
data]{.mark} regularly.]{.underline} [This limitation does not mean such
organisations would not benefit from c]{.underline}yber
[t]{.underline}hreat [i]{.underline}nformation [sharing]{.underline};
**[rather [they need different info]{.mark}rmation.]{.underline}**

Neither is this approach economically efficient. Most organisations do
not need access to technical data in real-time. Despite the rapidly
changing nature of cyber threats in a technical sense, for most
organisations, cyber security requirements and best practices do not
change much from day to day. In addition, not every business has
in-house technical accounting or legal skills---why should cyber
security be different? [[Current practice does not]{.mark} sufficiently
[differentiate between]{.mark} organisations in terms of [what
info]{.mark}rmation [they]{.mark} should [share]{.mark} under what
circumstances and how frequently]{.underline}.

**[C. Information Sharing is Easy]{.underline}**

In January 2008, [[the US government started the]{.mark} Comprehensive
National Cybersecurity Initiative ([CNCI]{.mark}),]{.underline}
formalising it in National Security Presidential Directive 54 / Homeland
Security Presidential Directive 23 (The White House, 2010). '[Connect
the Centers,' one of CNCI's twelve lines of effort, focused on
information sharing with the goal of linking the US
government's]{.underline} cyber [centres into one common operating
picture]{.underline}; over the long-term, it was intended to incorporate
the private sector. [Everyone assumed that this element would be the
easiest to implement]{.underline} and the first to be completed.
**[[However]{.mark}, thirteen years later]{.underline}**, [[this
element]{.mark} is]{.underline} arguably one part of the CNCI vision
that **[[remains unrealised]{.underline}]{.mark}** [as the cyber
security centres are not seamlessly connected and many silos remain
stubbornly in place.]{.underline}

A similar situation has played out in the private sector with the
creation of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). The
assumption was that companies would eagerly join these organisations,
share what they knew and consume the information shared by others. Yet,
more than twenty years after the concept was formalised into national
legislation, many sectors are just now forming an ISAC and, even in the
most successful of them, the percentage of participants that actively
share information is widely understood within the industry to remain
low.

Public sector efforts to share information with the private sector have
suffered analogous problems. [The US government created]{.underline} the
[Automated]{.underline} Indicator [Sharing]{.underline} (AIS) programme
[as a free service]{.underline} for general businesses, but few
organisations have signed up and even fewer contribute to the programme
(Marks, 2018). This is unsurprising if we look at what is being shared;
[a US government [report]{.mark}]{.underline} from 2018 [[suggested that
just **two**]{.mark}]{.underline} or three [[out of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the **[[11,447 indicators]{.underline}]{.mark}** submitted to AIS by the
Department of Homeland Security [[were]{.underline}]{.mark} 'malicious
and related to [cyber [incidents]{.mark} \[... while\] many of the
indicators received were false positives or redundant
information']{.underline} (DHS Office of Inspector General, 2017: p.
15).

[The]{.underline} three [examples highlight that information sharing is
difficult]{.underline} for a variety of reasons. Simply [creating
programmes and establishing [sharing mechanisms is insufficient]{.mark}
[without addressing]{.mark} obstacles to sharing actionable information.
These include underlying factors such as **[over-classification,
reputational risk, and legal concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[as well as **operational hurdles**]{.underline} [around validation,
standardisation, timeliness, and automation]{.underline} (Zibak &
Simpson, 2019).

3\. REBUILDING INFORMATION SHARING: NEW IMPERATIVES

[[These]{.underline} **[incorrect assumptions]{.underline}**
[have]{.underline} **[undermined info]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[rmation
[sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[as a]{.mark}n effective
[tool]{.mark}]{.underline} [[against cyber threats]{.underline}]{.mark},
yet policies, structures, and processes must be based on assumptions
about the overall environment in order to function. As a replacement for
the faulty assumptions explained above, this chapter proposes four
alternative presumptions to enable effective information sharing. First,
cyber threat information consists of multiple information types across
different levels, with distinct value to different consumers, meaning
that information sharing needs to be tailored and nuanced. Second, for
this reason, relevance and comparative advantage should drive sharing
activities. Third, effective information sharing efforts must overcome
context-specific technical, economic, legal, and cultural barriers; and
fourth, trust is a necessary component of information sharing. The rest
of this section will explore these alternative presumptions in greater
detail.

Von Clausewitz might have lived through the Napoleonic wars, but he
could just as well have been writing about the present state of affairs
[in cyberspace]{.underline}. The fact is that [[the multitude of
threats]{.mark} that populate the virtual eco-system [is]{.mark} so
**[all-embracing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that it is **[impossible to
defend]{.mark}**]{.underline} against every form of attack (Symantec,
2015). [The unfortunate reality is that **[every system can]{.mark}
eventually [be compromised]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[no computer is safe]{.underline}**. Furthermore, America\'s
[electronic infrastructure is so riddled with vulnerabilities and there
are so many adversaries out there, that \"cybersecurity\" is a
**relative term**]{.underline} indeed (Brasso, 2016).

[Adversaries]{.underline} in cyberspace [range from state-sponsored
hackers to the professional perpetrators of cybercrime, to any person
with a grudge and an internet link.]{.underline} Moreover, [because of
the proliferation of adversaries and the inescapable vulnerability of
the U.S. critical infrastructure, [cyberattacks]{.mark} on its various
elements [are a **daily fact of life.**]{.mark}]{.underline} For
instance, the Industrial Control Systems-Computer Emergency Response
Team (ICS-CERT) reports that the U.S. industrial control systems were
attacked at least 245 times over a 12-month period (OAS, 2015). In other
parts of the world, [a 2015 attack on Ukraine\'s power grid left 700,000
people without electricity for]{.underline} several [hours]{.underline}
\[Brasso, 2016). And the perpetrators of the Ukrainian attack were
observed conducting similar attacks against the U.S. energy sector
(Brasso, 2016). Though there was never any actual disruption, many
experts believe that [those [exploits]{.mark} were a reconnaissance
[for]{.mark} future moves on]{.underline} the U.S.
[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark} (Brasso, 2016). So **[they [are
still out there]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[The reason why this topic is so worrisome is that [a **successful
digital Pearl Harbor type cyberattack**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
electrical infrastructure [[would leave the U.S. **cloaked in
darkness**]{.underline}, [with]{.underline}]{.mark} [its
[people]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[unable to
communicate]{.mark}]{.underline}** with each other [and without **any
form of twenty-first century transport**]{.underline}[. [It
would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely **[[kill]{.mark} many]{.underline}**
thousands of citizens, perhaps **[[millions]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
either [[through **civil unrest,**]{.mark} **failure of public systems,
or [mass starvation]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Brasso, 2016). [This could
be the **foreseeable situation**]{.underline} if hackers successfully
shut down the U.S. power grid. Consequently, in the larger sense, [[the
key question]{.mark} is, \"[Could a catastrophic
cyberattack]{.mark}]{.underline} in the U.S. infrastructure [[ever
occur]{.mark}?]{.underline} The National Security Agency\'s former
Director, Mike Rodgers, made his own evaluation of the possibility of a
successful attack against critical infrastructure when he said;
\"**[[It\'s a matter of, when, not if]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" (Smith,
2014).

To illustrate the reason why something as unthinkable as a digital Pearl
Harbor could happen, the non-profit Privacy Rights Clearinghouse reports
that we have lost over one BILLION records over the past decade and
these are just the losses that were REPORTED. Since most companies do
not like to publicize their security failures that number could be, and
probably is, much higher. The running average of 100 million records
lost per year has been subject to some variation overtime and the source
of breaches has changed in common-sense ways as the technology has
evolved. Nonetheless, the number of reported incidents rose annually
from 108 in 2005, to 607 in 2013 (PRC, 2015). The important point to
note is that while losses have increased at a rate of fifty-percent per
year over the same period corporate budgets for security have increased
at the rate of fifty-one percent (Symantec, 2014).

Consequently[, it is]{.underline} probably [safe to say that
[cyberattacks **are going to happen**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [no matter
how much money we throw at the problem. At the same time]{.underline},
notwithstanding the clear recognition of the disastrous nature of a
successful cyberattack, [**[none]{.underline}** [of the
industries]{.underline}]{.mark} [in our current national infrastructure
[have developed an effective]{.mark} standard [strategy]{.mark} to
protect themselves]{.underline} (Brasso, 2016). [[This
includes]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Chemical]{.mark} Sector;
[Commercial]{.mark} Facilities]{.underline}**: Communications; Dams;
**[the [Defense]{.mark} Industrial Base]{.underline}**; Emergency
Services; **[[Energy]{.mark}: [Financial]{.mark} Services; [Food]{.mark}
and Agriculture]{.underline}**; Government Facilities;
**[[Healthcare]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Public Health; Information
Technology; **[[Nuclear Reactors]{.mark}, Materials, and Waste;
Transportation; [and Water]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Wastewater
**[[Systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** (PPD-21, 2013, p.2).

So, [what [we are suggesting]{.mark} here is that the paradigm [we
adopted]{.mark} long before the internet needs to be seriously
rethought. Right now, we secure systems at the logical points of
access]{.underline}. Even defense-in-depth, which is the modern doctrine
for doing that, simply involves several increasingly rigorous
perimeters. **[Instead]{.underline}** of throwing our resources into
defending the system at all points of attack, perhaps [we should devise
ways to ensure that the system assets]{.underline} that [we cannot
afford to lose are unconditionally protected]{.underline}. In concept,
this strategy would narrow the attack surface to the point where
absolute assurance within available resources could be guaranteed, while
reducing the impact and recovery time of non-essential assets. [This
selective versus universal approach to security is what sums up the
difference between [a **cyberresilient strategy**]{.mark}, and one that
is based on cybersecurity.]{.underline}

2\. Cyber resilience versus cybersecurity

It is important to make a distinction between present ideas about
cybersecurity and the approach we are suggesting. Cyber resilience is a
much narrower strategic vision than the more diffuse activities that
fall under the generic heading of \"cybersecurity.\" At its heart,
cybersecurity ensures against unknown, or unwanted penetrations of
protected space. In that respect, a cybersecurity solution deploys a
comprehensive set of defenses to ensure against unauthorized access to
protected objects, either from external or internal sources. To
accomplish its mission, cybersecurity deploys a targeted set of
protection measures at all viable points of entry, along with the
appropriate detection mechanisms to respond to known forms of
unauthorized access. Whereas, cyber resilience attempts to create a
security architecture that will ensure the continuous effective
functioning of just the organization\'s core functionality.

Thus, cybersecurity focuses on access control, while cyber-resilience
focuses on identifying and securing just those assets that the
organization can\'t live without. In many respects, the cyber-resilience
concept is comparable to locking up just those critical resources that
an organization needs to survive. Those critical resources are then put
into a safe within the building. This is in direct contrast with a
strategy that attempts to protect every asset of value within the entire
building. It should be evident that these are two entirely different
approaches, especially from a resource utilization standpoint.

Ideally these two approaches work in tandem to create a secure
organization. Both are important and neither works as effectively as it
should if the other is missing. [[Cyber resilience is an emerging
concept]{.mark} and there are already several institutionally sponsored
approaches to creating a cyber resilient organization. These methods
develop comprehensive enterprise architectures with the aim of building
in greater resiliency]{.underline}. The methodology centers on and is
driven by assessment and metrics. The assessment characterizes and then
seeks to improve the resiliency of the enterprise\'s existing
architecture. The goal is to understand the organization\'s practical
ability of uninterrupted functionality, as well as the ability to
recover within an acceptable period. The metrics of this entire process
are meant to ensure continuous improvement. The approach itself, is
deliberate and incremental and is a broad-scale strategic development
process in the sense that the requisite capabilities are phased into
existing enterprise processes in a planned and rational fashion.

3\. Creating a cyber resilient architecture

[Cyber [resilience is not]{.mark} just [a matter of building
higher]{.mark} and thicker [walls]{.mark}. Cyber [resilience involves
the creation of]{.mark} a set of well-defined [processes, which are
designed to react to]{.mark} successful [penetrations]{.mark} of the
organizational perimeter, affecting secure space. Cyber [resilient
processes prevent the attacker from ever reaching]{.mark} and harming
the organization\'s [most critical assets]{.mark}]{.underline} and they
do not fortify every access point beyond basic access control
countermeasures.

[Cyber [resilience is founded on **classification, prioritization,
and**]{.mark} comprehensive **[strategic policy-based
deployment]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a rigorous set of real-world
security controls. The security controls strictly ensure the achievement
of just the organizational purpose. Therefore, less resources are
required. These controls are both electronic and behavioral and they are
designed to protect key assets, as well as ensure optimum recovery of
the overall system in the event of successful attack. Figure 1 below
shows the cyber resiliency process. The process is embodied in seven
generic principles and are as follows:

1\. Classify: You can\'t protect things that you don\'t know exist.
Therefore, all the organization\'s assets must be identified, labeled,
and arrayed in a coherent baseline of \"things.\" This baseline
describes all potential protection targets and it is maintained under
strict configuration management. This is comparable to the
\"Classification\" phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST,
2014).

2\. Risk: Resiliency requires appropriate situational awareness.
Therefore, a broad-spectrum risk assessment must be performed that
characterizes all known threat scenarios as they apply to the identified
asset base. This is a risk assessment process comparable to the
\"Security Assessment\" phase of NIST SP 800-53a (NIST SP 800-53A Rev.4,
2014).

3\. Rank - the assets that the organization absolutely can\'t afford to
lose are selected, evaluated and a provably effective countermeasure
response is deployed for each of the chosen assets. Organizational
resources are focused on only assuring those critical things. The
resources that are left over are then allocated to ensuring the
protection and recovery of the rest of the organization\'s
functionality. This is comparable to the \"Select\" phase of the NIST
Risk Management Framework (NIST, 2014).

4\. Design/Deplov: Resilience must be baked-into the architecture so
that critical functions are assured given a generally successful attack.
This is a design/control deployment exercise comparable to the
\"Implement\" phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST, 2014).

5\. Test: Architectural resilience needs to be assured. This is a
planning and oversight function that characterizes critical control
performance against stated mission goals. Methods like penetration
testing apply here. This is an assessment process comparable to the
\"Assess\" phase of the NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST, 2014).

6\. Recover: Well-defined processes need to be documented and
established to ensure that all enterprise functions are fully restored
within requisite parameters. This is comparable to the
\"Plan-Purpose-Scope-Relationship\" recommendations embodied in NIST SP
800-34 Rev. 1 (NIST, 2010).

7\. Evolve: the organization dynamically adjusts its cyber-resilient
architecture based on lessons learned. This is comparable to the
implementation of the NIST Cyber Security Framework process (NIST-CSF,
2014).

4\. Principle 1: Classify

In some respects, cyber resilience is nothing more than an ultimate
defense-in-depth and continuity management solution rolled into a
highly-limited protection mission. [The core aim of
cyber-[resilience]{.mark} is to [maintain critical business
functionality at all costs]{.mark}. Thus, the decisions that come out of
the cyber-resilience design process will determine how the business will
invest its precious time and resources and build its
architecture.]{.underline} The key to cyber resilience is understanding
what constitutes core functionality. Cyber resilience assumes that all
systems will eventually be compromised. Given this assumption, the cyber
resilience function ensures a robust array of specifically targeted
controls to ensure that only the subset of functions essential to the
continuing operation of the business are completely protected, even if
all other system activities are compromised. In conjunction with the
goal of ensuring the survival of core functionality, the cyber
resilience process also defines clear, straightforward and practical
paths to restore any lower priority functions that might have been lost
in the actual compromise. The seven stages of cyber resilience are
designed to achieve those two specific goals.

All computerized systems are complex and highly interdependent so, the
essence of success lies in the identification of just those fundamental
processes and relationships that deliver a given desired outcome. The
identification process is perhaps the most important step in creating a
cyber-resilient organization because the outcome of the classification
process will drive every subsequent protection action. In practical
terms, if an organization does not understand what assets they have, it
is almost impossible to intelligently protect them. Only eighteen
percent of organizations reported being effective in classifying mission
critical information assets (EY, 2014). The majority of surveyed
organizations reported that they were minimally effective or did not
know how effective they were (EY, 2014). Thus, a deliberate, formally
executed and documented classification activity is the key starting
point. This is an organization-wide exercise whose aim is to understand
the criticality, sensitivity, and priority of all items in the asset
base. It involves all stakeholders because buy-in is an essential
condition for embedding changes in the organization.

5\. Principle 2: Risk

[Risk assessment provides timely and accurate understanding of the
threat status of all components of the asset base [and is essentially a
**situational awareness function**]{.mark}. The Risk stage employs
**[situational awareness]{.mark}** practices to **[drive the
decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[about the best way to ensure critical
assets]{.mark} and services will **[continue to function]{.mark}** as
desired]{.underline}. The aim is to fully understand every conceivable
hazard in the threat environment that might affect a critical asset. The
term \"hazard\" denotes a threat or an incident, natural or manmade,
that warrants action to protect against harm and to minimize disruptions
of the mission. This includes natural disasters, cyber incidents, acts
of terrorism, sabotage, and destructive criminal activity targeting
critical components of the enterprise infrastructure (PDD-21, 2014).

The outcome of this phase is a detailed map of the threat environment
sufficient to support decision making with respect to organizational
priorities. No decisions are made until the entire threat assessment is
mapped. There is obviously a potential that meaningful threats might be
missed, or that a new threat might appear after the original risk
assessment is completed. Therefore, there also should be a comprehensive
plan to ensure subsequent systematic risk assessments against any
potential attack that might occur against assets viewed as critical.
Since the architecture will be altered to respond to those threats it is
also crucial that a process exists to rapidly respond to those risks.
The outcome is reasonable confidence that all conceivable risks to a
given asset and its dependencies have been identified, characterized and
ranked for likelihood and impact.

6\. Principle 3: Rank

This is the second most important aspect of the cyber-resilience
process. Once the organization\'s assets have been identified and
baselined and the threat environment characterized, the criticality of
all assets in the asset baseline is ranked. This is an organization-wide
ranking process involving all stakeholders. \"Assets\" comprise all of
the people, processes, technologies, and facilities required to achieve
the organizational purpose. However, some assets are more critical than
others. The ranking process identifies, documents, and assures only
those assets ranked as \"critical\" to the organization\'s mission,
vision, values and purposes (PDD-21, 2014).

Unfortunately, ranking can often turn into a political free-for-all
where various stakeholders attempt to enforce their own agendas.
Obviously, this can\'t be allowed to happen, if the eventual
architectural solution is going to be truly resilient. Therefore,
criticality must be understood based on a clear map of functions and
dependencies, which are referenced in an objective and rational way to
the mission and goals of the organization. Therefore, an asset can only
be labeled \"critical\" if it provably underwrites some aspect of the
organization\'s core functionality.

A rigorous set of protection requirements are specified for just those
assets that directly enable the organizational mission. Rigor is defined
as the ability to resist any known or conceivable method of attack
(PDD-21, 2014). Relevant stakeholders are assigned to supervise and
maintain each asset. Effective communications linkages are established
between those stakeholders and documented. Then the protection
requirements, access links, and the requisite permissions are enabled as
a coherent set of electronic and behavioral controls.

7\. Principle 4: Design/deploy

Design deploys the controls required to ensure a critical asset. This is
a strategic governance process. Design creates an infrastructure of
substantive controls to effectively satisfy its stated mission, goals
and objectives. Thus, this phase identifies the explicit control
objectives for each critical asset. It prioritizes those objectives and
implements targeted control actions to most effectively achieve priority
objectives. Then it analyzes and assesses the deployed control set to
ensure that the resultant infrastructure satisfies the critical purpose.
If documented control objectives are not satisfied, then the Design
process undertakes the necessary analysis to modify controls, or plug
gaps.

8\. Principle 6: Recover

Organizations need to understand how resilient its critical services
are. This is essentially the continuity management principle. The goal
of recovery planning is to ease the impact of disruptive events by using
well-established plans to ensure predictable and consistent continuity
of the critical services (PDD-21, 2014). To do this, the critical
service\'s operating environment is studied to identify all potential
failure modes and then a proper strategy to recover from all possible
breakdowns, or disruptions is devised.

The goal is to create a complete and consistent recovery process that
will address all conceivable types of system compromise. The plan for
incident recovery must be explicit for every asset and lessons learned
are compiled to develop improvement strategies. This requires an
operational plan capable of identifying, analyzing, responding to,
escalating and learning from all adverse incidents. A well-defined
process for assigning roles and responsibilities and managing and
tracking resolutions.

9\. Principle 7: Evolve

The Evolve stage serves as the formal basis for identifying and
deploying process and technology responses and improvements across the
organization. This evolution is required to meet the organization\'s
cyber resilience goals as the threat picture changes. In this stage,
measurable improvements that could increase the resilience of critical
assets are identified, analyzed, and systematically deployed. The
effects of currently deployed processes and technology improvements are
measured and the effectiveness of the selected process improvement is
characterized. The five functions that must be executed mirror those of
the NIST Cyber Security Framework (NIST-CSF, 2014).

Evolution is driven by the collection and analysis of data from lessons
learned about the operation of the day-to-day execution of the
resilience process. Improvement recommendations are supported by data
obtained from the deployment of prior process and technology controls.
Nevertheless, because this is essentially a \"maintenance,\" activity
this type of analysis involves ongoing testing and risk estimation.
Lessons-learned typically involve objectively evaluating the performance
of deployed processes against plans, objectives, standards, and
procedures; as well as the outcomes of organizational innovation and
deployment process.

10\. Conclusion

[We understand that systems will never be 100% secure and there are
simply **too many threats**]{.underline} to ever make that declaration.
[Organizations are far more exposed to a wider range of unknown, or even
unknowable, attacks]{.underline} (EY, 2014). [Given the existence of a
myriad of unknowable elements in the cyber-threat environment,
[organizations must be able to **detect**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[respond]{.underline}**]{.mark} creatively [[to
threats]{.mark} to their basic operation. The]{.underline} response
encompasses all forms of attack; electronic, behavioral, and physical.
[Thus, the concept of cyber-[resilience goes]{.mark} far [beyond]{.mark}
the classic boundaries of [better hardware]{.mark} and software access
controls]{.underline} (EY, 2014). [Instead, organizations need to
establish a \"cyber resilience strategy\" that gives them ability to
withstand and recover rapidly from disruptive events]{.underline} (EY,
2014).

Practically speaking, organizations have to start rethinking
strategically and given the large number of threats and the limited
resources available to counter them, concentrate their resources where
they will make the most difference. This means that businesses should
stop viewing security as an access control and incident response
problem. Instead they should approach the problem as a comprehensive,
fully integrated, strategic management commitment; aimed at ensuring
survival and easing recovery. This goal requires that a robust set of
concrete controls are embedded in the enterprise architecture. The
umbrella term for this approach is, \"cyber resilience\"

[Cyber [resilience recognizes that adversaries will
succeed]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are too many advanced hacking tools
to prevent sophisticated attackers from finding the cracks in even the
most robust cyber-security system (Lois, 2015).

[Accordingly, cyber resilience must be an organizational
condition]{.underline} rather than a deployed set of explicit
countermeasures. [Cyber resilience should be integrated into the
\"**bones\" of the organization**]{.underline} and requires the
organization to spend whatever it takes to develop a well-defined,
explicit architecture of controls to ensure cyber resiliency. The
controls must assure provable protection of core functionality and its
various interdependencies to include every form of electronic, human and
physical threat inside and outside the enterprise\'s eco-system (EY,
2014).

Cyber resilience is not a traditional defensive stance focused on
detecting network intrusions or fixing malware. Instead, [the
[resilience]{.mark} concept [emphasizes]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[practical [survival and recovery]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the system
in the face of all conceivable forms of attack. Effective implementation
of a cyber-resilient enterprise architecture requires strategic vision.
It also requires day-to-day engagement across the enterprise to assure
and optimize that vision. Unfortunately, this perspective is new, and it
will require a change in culture to accomplish.

In general, our belief is that [the only way organizations are going to
effectively prevent the inevitable digital Pearl Harbor is to amalgamate
cyber security and cyber resilience concepts into a **single
strategy**]{.underline}. [The increased presence of advanced cyber
threats makes it inevitable that all targeted organizations will
ultimately be compromised]{.underline} (Trend Micro, 2015).
[Nevertheless, at its fundamental root the organization needs to survive
and every organization\'s critical systems must be assured
safe]{.underline}, assuming any realistic set of conditions. [Lost data
or ancillary functionality can be restored after the attack, but the key
functions of the organization must be protected. Cyber resilient
organizations can \"tough-out\" cyber-attacks and continue to accomplish
the fundamental mission]{.underline}. [Therefore, it is incumbent on
decision makers to redesign or update their essential systems for
[resilience]{.mark}. This condition should [make attacks less likely to
succeed, minimize the consequences]{.mark} when they do succeed,
increase the work-factor cost and uncertainty for the adversary,
[and]{.mark} possibly [act as a deterrent against future
attacks]{.mark}. Consequently, investment in building [cyber resilience
is]{.mark} **[strategic investment in]{.mark}** organizational
**[survival]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

conceptual models of SG vulnerabilities are presented to address the
issue of the vulnerability of SG control systems against cyber-attacks.
Different scenarios of cyber-attacks are then dealt with in SG control
systems to enhance their resilience.

1\. INTRODUCTION

[[The main security issues]{.mark} of SG control systems [against
cyberattacks are]{.mark}]{.underline} given in Figure 1. These issues
are divided into four categories:

 **[[Identifying]{.mark} different
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** and scenarios for attacking SG
control systems and trying to prevent it

 **[[Providing strategies to detect]{.underline}]{.mark}** and identify
the attack

 [Recombining and using control [tools to **reduce the
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline} of the attack and increase the system\'s
selfhealing properties

 [[Improving]{.mark} cyber [security management]{.mark}]{.underline} in
SG control systems

2\. CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF CONTROL SYSTEMS VULNERABILITIES IN SMART GRID

Controlling of SG in energy systems has the task of directing and
controlling physical processes. They usually consist of a set of
multiple components including sensors, operators, data processing units
such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), communication networks,
and central computers. There are several general models for elucidating
the structure of smart control systems \[1, 2\]. A conceptual model of
SG control system vulnerabilities is presented in Figure 2. As can be
seen from the Figure 2, the vulnerabilities of the SG control system are
divided into six categories:

1- Field equipment vulnerabilities

2- Field equipment communication network vulnerabilities

3- Local controller vulnerabilities such as remote terminal units (RTUs)
and PLCs

4- Vulnerabilities of control network communication protocols

5- Local area network (LAN) control vulnerabilities

6- Vulnerabilities of cooperative and financial-commercial networks

The layered structure of this conceptual model emphasizes that the types
of vulnerabilities of each layer of SG control system are different, and
therefore each layer requires different security measures.

3\. IDENTIFY DIFFERENT VULNERABILITIES AND SCENARIOS OF CYBER-ATTACK IN
SMART GRID CONTROL SYSTEMS

[With the advancement of control and protection systems in
SGs]{.underline} as well as their use of the same software, hardware and
network platforms and having the same standards, [it is possible for
unauthorized persons to access the internal layers of these
systems]{.underline}. In general, an attacker who intends to attack a
cyber-attack and damage an intelligent control system faces two major
challenges:

 Identifying, penetrating and accessing the system

 Taking full or partial control of the process and damage it

So [[the first step in securing smart grid control systems is to
**identify vulnerabilities and access points**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
can be divided into two major areas of communication equipment and
protocols. The devices used in smart grid control systems also fall into
two categories:

1- Equipment used solely for control systems, such as sensors,
actuators, RTUs, and PLCs

2- IT equipment used in other systems and networks such as switches and
computers

In this section, we first discuss a number of articles addressing the
vulnerabilities of communication protocols of the SG control system and
their solutions. Then, considering the extent of equipment
vulnerabilities and articles in this field, first class equipment
vulnerabilities are discussed. Finally, four categories of scenarios for
attack on control systems in SGs are investigated.

3-1- Communication vulnerabilities and attempts to prevent intrusive
influence

[Nowadays, many protocols are used in intelligent control systems. Most
of these protocols are designed to increase efficiency]{.underline},
reliability in real-time operations, and support for economic and
operational requirements. [**[Unfortunately]{.underline}**,
[most]{.underline}]{.mark} [of these [protocols have ignored]{.mark} any
unnecessary [security features]{.mark}]{.underline} such as
authentication and cryptography to enhance performance. Many have been
developed by others to use the Ethernet protocol and connect to the
Internet. [[Therefore]{.mark}, the [communication protocols]{.mark} of
industrial control systems [are **very vulnerable** ]{.mark}**and
exposed**]{.underline} many attacks \[3\]. According to the American Gas
Association reports, there are about 150 to 200 supervisory control and
data acquisition (SCADA) protocols. [The integration of these protocols
in recent years [has resulted in the attackers obtaining **very accurate
information**]{.mark}]{.underline} on their function and structure. [In
this way, attackers can identify and modify data packets by identifying
vulnerabilities in these protocols]{.underline} \[4\]; like the attack
on Queensland\'s Australian Water and Wastewater Control System in 2000
when an attacker was able to infiltrate the field\'s communications
network and bring 800,000 liters of sewage into the city\'s safe water
cycle by having complete information about the attacking protocol. The
vulnerabilities of these protocols have been investigated in several
sources. References \[3, 5\] discuss a variety of industrial protocols,
their vulnerabilities and security solutions. One of the issues
discussed in this source is the Modbus protocol that lacks
authentication, encryption, and encryption integrity.

One of [the most useful and]{.underline} also [dangerous
features]{.underline} of Modbus [is]{.underline} its [ability to program
controllers that many SG protocols share]{.underline} with Modbus. [Due
to this dangerous feature, attacker can use it to inject
malware]{.underline} into PLCs and RTUs. One of the methods of intrusion
detection in Modbus protocols is the use of model-based intrusion
detection systems. Reference \[6\] introduces three model-based methods
for monitoring and detecting Modbus TCP protocol attack. These methods
provide a protection mechanism with respect to the topology and
communication structure of the SCADA network. In order to prevent
unauthorized access to the protected system, firewalls have been
suggested as a security solution in many sources. One of its tasks is to
block messages that are not structured in accordance with the protected
area communication protocol \[7\].

Another common way to increase the security of communication protocols
is to use cryptography. There are various traditional methods of
encryption, but most are not usable in smart grid control systems. The
reason is the limited computing power and low data transmission speed of
these components, which must also meet the real-time performance
requirements. These limitations make it difficult to implement
sophisticated encryption. Reference \[8\] has explored various
encryption methods to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

3-2- Control equipment vulnerabilities

[[Many cyberattacks]{.mark} on industrial control systems [have]{.mark}
been [exploited]{.mark} to exploit [vulnerabilities]{.mark} in control
equipment]{.underline}, one of which is the Stuxnet attack. [[Therefore,
**identification**]{.underline} [of these vulnerabilities
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [one of [the issue]{.mark}s [of interest]{.mark}
to researchers in this field]{.underline} \[9\]. In recent years, [in
addition to software vulnerabilities, various types of hardware have
also been heavily favored]{.underline} by security experts. These are
widespread in processors and electronic components and are found even on
telecommunication surfaces \[10\].

3-3- Investigation and identification of different scenarios of attacks
on SG control systems

[Overall, there are five types of scenarios for attack on control
systems of SGs]{.underline}:

3-3-1- **[Static false data injection attack]{.underline}**

In static false data injection attack, [the attacker changes the sensor
output to such a way that the control system does not cheat and fails to
send the wrong data to the controller]{.underline}. This scenario was
first put forward in 2009 for an attack on the power system and its
faulty detection system, assuming the attacker had full knowledge of the
system \[11\]. In the references \[12, 13\], [authors have proved that
an attacker can even launch a successful attack **even with partial
awareness**]{.underline}. In an effort to counteract this attack, the
source proposes two security measures for the power grid state
estimator, which is actually a measure of the minimum amount of attacker
effort required to successfully execute an attack. These scales depend
on the physical topology of the power grid and the degree of
availability of the sensor outputs. Reference \[14\] stated that
complete encryption and out-of-the-box protection of all equipment is
not cost-effective and enforceable, and that the success of the
injection attack can be prevented by protecting a limited number of
measurements and their output. The number of these measurements is equal
to the number of system state variables. In reference \[15\], two
algorithms offer protection for a limited number of devices in such a
way as to provide maximum security against injection attacks. Reference
\[16\] first described an optimal attack strategy that can cause maximum
damage to the system, and then by formulating the defense problem, it
has been able to develop an optimal defense strategy and minimize the
amount of damage. The economic effects of the data injection attack on
the electricity grid market performance were formulated in paper \[17\].

3-3-2- **[Attack on power grid state estimator and wrong data
injection]{.underline}**

The purpose of the power grid state estimator is to estimate the state
variables of that system based on the measured data. In reference
\[18\], the control center of the state system matrix of the variables
was described. Inappropriate estimates can be due to various reasons,
such as measurement failures or malicious attacks. [In this
scenario]{.underline}, it is assumed that [the attacker]{.underline}
knows the state matrix variables of the target power system and [makes
subversive measurements]{.underline} with knowledge of this matrix. [It
then injects these erroneous measurements into the control system to
disrupt the state estimation process]{.underline}. Figure 3 provides a
schematic overview of the data injection attack on power grid control
system.

3-3-3- **[Invalid dynamic data injection attack]{.underline}**

[The attack attempts to inject the wrong data dynamically and create an
unstable and invisible fashion in the system.]{.underline} Reference
\[19\] assumed that the attacker\'s purpose is to inject the wrong data,
**[destabilize the system]{.underline}**, and remain secret. The author
used the Kalman filter and the linear--quadratic-- Gaussian (LQG)
controller to monitor and control the discontinuous linear system over
time, as well as to detect the attack of a false dynamic data injection.
Finally, this article described the requirements for a successful attack
and proposes a method to counter attack based on the use of plugin
sensors.

3-3-4- **[Information recovery attack]{.underline}**

One of [the most]{.underline} **[dangerous attacks]{.underline}** [is
the information recovery attack]{.underline}. As observed in the \"data
injection\" attacks, if [the attacker]{.underline} can access the sensor
or operator output data, he [can enter the wrong data]{.underline} in an
intelligent and purposeful manner, or accidentally, and control Error
making the receiver \[20\]. In an information recovery attack, [the
attacker records the sensor or operator information under normal system
conditions]{.underline} and sends it to the control network at the time
of the attack and sabotage \[21\]. As such, [the control system is
cleverly deceived and]{.underline}, in addition to the loop control,
**[the system goes into danger]{.underline}**. One way to counter this
attack is to add a Gaussian random input with a mean of zero to the
system input \[22\]. Random input is an authentication signal and it is
attempted to be optimally designed to minimize impact on system
performance.

3-3-**[5- Stealth attack]{.underline}**

The attack is actually a closed-loop information reconstruction attack.
In other words, the attack output is reconstructed as a closed loop to
eliminate the effect on the sensor output and keep the attack hidden. In
these kinds of attacks, attacker should have a thorough understanding of
the physical model of the system under control in order to simulate a
model similar to it. As shown in Figure 4, the attacker puts the
simulated model and its controller between the system and the master
controller; and [by sending arbitrary signals to the main controller
input, it hides the attack and replaces the arbitrary work
point.]{.underline}

4\. IMPROVING CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT IN SG CONTROL SYSTEMS TO ENHANCE
RESILIENCE OF POWER CONTROL SYSTEMS

[[In order to achieve **optimal security**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
addition to using appropriate security strategies [[there must
be]{.underline}]{.mark} good security management. Appropriate security
management tools include security [[policies]{.mark}, strategies, and
programs [that are based on **accurate threat**]{.mark} **and risk
[analysis]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [In other words, given the wide range
of cyber threats that industrial control systems are exposed to, [it is
**essential** to **identify and analyze these
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to provide an **optimal**]{.underline}
and cost-effective [safeguard strategy]{.underline}. In general, the
field of study of the articles in this section can be categorized as
follows:

1- Providing methods for identifying cyber threats and assessing their
risks in industrial control systems

2- Considering such analysis and evaluations to extract and select the
optimal and cost-effective defense strategy and formulate a security
plan Much effort has been made to provide methods for identifying
threats and risks as well as analyzing them in industrial control
systems. In reference \[23\], it is attempted to estimate the security
threats of cyber-physical systems using the game theory method.

5\. CONCLUSION

In addition to exploiting unknown vulnerabilities, [[cyber attackers are
developing **more sophisticated methods to attack smart grid**]{.mark}
**control systems**]{.underline}. Thus, [after going through IT-based
security strategies, [they are]{.mark} virtually [confronted with a
control system **without security protections**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On
the other hand, [the ultimate goal of attackers is to damage and disrupt
the optimal functioning of the physical system under
control]{.underline}, which is ignored in IT-based security strategies.
It can only be stated that [IT-based security strategies alone **cannot
provide a depth defense strategy**]{.underline} (the in-depth defense
strategy allows the attacker to pass through each layer again to a
security layer that eliminates Designed to reduce the attack (or reduce
its impact) to control systems. [Therefore, this article
[identif]{.mark}ied various [vulnerabilities]{.mark} and scenarios of
cyber-attack in smart grid control systems so as to **[increase system
resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline} of power system and [to [reduce the
effects of such attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Power systems are the most important]{.mark} cyber--physical
[systems]{.mark} that **[guarantee]{.mark} reliability**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} other [[critical infrastructures including]{.underline}
**[water]{.underline}**]{.mark} networks, **[[transportation, or
health]{.underline}]{.mark}** systems \[1\]. While the application of
advanced monitoring system and supervisory control and data acquisition
(SCADA) systems enhanced the monitoring, protection, and security of
[smart grids,]{.underline} they have made the energy system [vulnerable
to [cyber threats]{.mark},]{.underline} which **[[can jeopardize the
security of power systems]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[2\], \[3\].

[[A cyberattacker can]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore [[inject computer
viruses]{.mark} or anomalies [to endanger the]{.mark} security and
[resilience of the smart grid]{.mark} system]{.underline} \[4\], \[5\],
\[6\]. Examples of such attacks include software bugs on Israel's
utility grid in 2016 \[7\], or Russian's cyberattack on obtaining
detailed data on nuclear power plants and water facilities in the U.S.
in 2018 \[8\]. Another real-world example is the successful cyberattack
by Russian hackers in December 2015 on the Ukraine power grid. In this
cyberattack, 30 substations were switched off by hackers which resulted
in a power outage of 1--6 h for almost 230,000 people \[9\].

[[Transmission lines are the **most important assets**]{.mark} **in
power delivery in smart grids**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline} **[if
failed]{.underline}**, [can cause serious **cascading problems leading
to blackouts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One example of such cascading
failure was a blackout in Italy that happened in 2004 \[10\].
[Cyber[attacks on transmission lines]{.mark} are normally designed to
[overflow a line]{.mark} or series of lines with the aim of cascading
failures. [Such]{.mark} transmission line [congestion can be achieved if
an attacker injects any **false data**]{.mark} on measurements
**[without being detected]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} **[bad
data detection algorithms]{.underline}** during the state-estimation
process. [Recent studies show that these [FDIs can]{.mark} be
deliberately designed in order to **[bypass]{.mark} state-estimation
methods [without being detected]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[11\], \[12\],
\[13\], \[14\], \[15\], \[16\]. [Therefore, targeted cyberattacks on
multiple transmission lines can pot[entially cause **cascading failures
resulting in blackouts.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[False data injection ([FDI]{.mark}) is a broad class of cyberattacks
that target the digital communications and control of a cyberphysical
system]{.underline} (CPS). Well-known real-world incidents such as
Stuxnet \[1\] and Dragonfly \[2\], \[3\] demonstrate the effectiveness
of FDI attacks. For example, [a malware-infected PLC in the power grid
[may send falsified sensor measurements that bypass standard
methods]{.mark} of bad data detection]{.underline} (BDD) \[4\], thus
[compromising the grid's state estimation. [FDI attacks against the

[[are **especially dangerous**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [AGC adapts

In the industrial world, [when a switch is flipped, we take for granted
that it will produce light]{.underline}, boot a computer, illuminate a
stadium or activate a power plant. [We know, of course, that power
losses can and do occu]{.underline}r. Many of us have lit candles during

transmission lines. As of this writing, the most populated state in the

cyber attack]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The issue when considering
a [systemic grid failure]{.mark}]{.underline} of this nature
[is]{.underline} twofold: [how did we reach a point where]{.underline}
[something so critical]{.underline} to routine life **[[now presents an
existential threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and what can we do to
**mitigate the risk of a catastrophic grid attack**]{.underline}?

This article posits that [the emergence of [cyber attacks on]{.mark}
industrial [control systems]{.mark}, as a means of **war or criminal
menace**]{.underline}, [[have reached a level of sophistication capable
of]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~crippling~~ \[[**[destroying]{.mark}\] those
[system]{.mark}**[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This article argues that [a
new grid security policy paradigm **is required**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[to thwart catastrophic grid failure]{.underline} -- [a paradigm
that]{.underline}]{.mark} recognises the inextricable link between
commercial power generation and national security. In section 5, seven
policy recommendations are outlined that may, in part, mitigate a future
where grid attacks pose existential risk to nations and their citizenry.
Those recommendations are: first, develop a comprehensive insurance
programme to minimise the financial risk of grid disruption; second,
train more cybersecurity professionals with particular expertise in
industrial control systems; third, [[institute]{.mark} a federally
mandated **[information-sharing]{.mark} programme**]{.underline} that is
centralised under United States Cyber Command; fourth, subsidise and/or
incentivise cybersecurity protections for small to mid-size utilities;
fifth, provide university grants for grid security research; sixth,
integrate new technologies with an eye towards securing the grid; and,
lastly, formulate clear rules of engagement for a military response to
grid disruption.

The purpose of this article is to provide the reader with an
introduction to this complex topic. It is the aim of the author to give
orientation to this issue and its many branches in the hope that better
understanding will animate further curiosity and, ultimately, positive
action on the part of the reader. Although many skilled and earnest
people work tirelessly to prevent a grid failure scenario, it is
essential that more be added to their ranks each day. Advisors,
engineers, regulators, private counsel to power generators, and many
others who play roles in electric power production are crucial to this
subject. So, while this article provides entrée to the topic of grid
security, its long-term objective is to spur action by the entire
energy-related community. In the end, [no one is immune to consequences
of grid failure]{.underline} and, therefore, everyone is responsible, in
part, for promoting grid integrity.2 In this regard, lawyers who
represent various actors in the energy sector are going to be faced with
questions and potential legal risks of a magnitude that they have never
experienced before.

1.2. Turning the power back on in a powerless world

'[Black start']{.underline}, not to be confused with the term
'blackout', [is the name given to the process of restoring an electric
grid to operation without relying on the external electric power
transmission network to recover from a total or partial
shutdown]{.underline}.3 At first glance, this description is
unremarkable, but [it implies a disturbing catch-22]{.underline} --
**[how might one restore power if the entire external transmission
network is compromised?]{.underline}**

If an electric disruption occurs at a household level, some homes may be
equipped with a modest gasoline generator to temporarily restore power.
If a hospital loses power, it will almost invariably be resupplied by
automatic, industrial-scale generators. These [micro considerations
hardly give anyone pause; they are hiccups on a stormy night or a snowy
day]{.underline}. In other words, their 'black start' is a quick and
effective process for restoring power. [But what happens, **at a macro
level**]{.underline}, [[when an electric grid]{.mark} supplying power to
large portions of the United States [goes black]{.mark}, or]{.underline}
worse, [what happens if **all of the United States' electric grids go
down simultaneously**]{.underline}?4 [In that scenario, [how
might]{.mark} enough non-grid [power be harnessed]{.mark}]{.underline}
and transmitted [[to turn the]{.mark}]{.underline} United States'
[[lights back on]{.underline}]{.mark}? Moreover, how might such a
catastrophe occur in the first place? Perhaps [[the more ominous
question]{.mark} is **not how, but [whether]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
not **[[we can survive]{.mark} such circumstances if they persist in the
long term.]{.underline}**

The United States electric grid ('the grid') is the 'largest
interconnected machine' in the world.5 It consists of more than 7000
power plants, 55,000 substations, 160,000 miles of high-voltage
transmission lines and millions of low-voltage distribution lines.6 The
scale and complexity of the grid in the context of the modern digital
world are beyond comprehension because within it are innumerable
industrial control systems; incalculable connections to digital
networks; millions, if not billions, of analogue or digital sensors;
many thousands of human actors; and trillions of lines of programming
code.7 Further complexifying the grid is that it is comprised of
generations of technologies, stitched together in ways that are not
inherently secure in a world of cyber threats.8 The vastness of the grid
makes security of it challenging. Likewise, the vastness of the grid
makes the opportunities for intrusion seemingly infinite.

By any measure, [[grid failure will unleash a **parade of
horrors**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Stores would close, [[food
scarcity]{.underline}]{.mark} would follow, [communication would cease,
garbage would pile up, planes would be grounded]{.underline}, **[[clean
water would become a luxury]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [service stations
would yield **[no fuel,]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[hospitals
would]{.underline}]{.mark} eventually [[go dark,]{.underline}
**[financial transactions would stop]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [and [this
is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[only the tip of the
iceberg]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- [in a prolonged grid failure **social
chaos would reign**]{.underline}, [once-[eradicated **diseases would
re-emerge**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, increasingly, [hope
of returning to a normal [life would **fad**]{.mark}**e**]{.underline}.9
[The notion of complete [grid failure]{.mark}, once relegated to science
fiction]{.underline} comics or James Bond movies, [[is]{.mark} now **not
only possible**]{.underline} [but]{.underline} also **[one of [the most
pressing national security threats today]{.mark}.]{.underline}**10

#### Scenario 2 -- Shipping \-\-- the industry is especially vulnerable to inevitable cyber attacks

Systematic Survey of Recent Advances and Future Trends", Information

[[Maritime transportation is **central**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [economic sustainability]{.mark} of many
regions throughout the world. [The growth in global population,
improvements in living standards and]{.mark} investment and
**[elimination of trade barriers]{.mark}** all contribute to driving an
ever-increasing reliance on the industry]{.underline}. In geographies
with navigable rivers or comprising a cluster of islands, maritime
transportation is the spine to both domestic and international trading.
Moreover, [in markets that demand sustainable development, low cost,
efficiency and, recently of growing importance, ecofriendly operations,
the [maritime]{.mark} sector [is responsible for **90% of**]{.mark}
**the [transportation]{.mark} of all goods**]{.underline} \[1,2\].
[Recent [developments in the I]{.mark}nternet of Things
(**[IoT]{.mark}**]{.underline}), **[Big Data and Artificial
Intelligence]{.underline}** [have enabled the migration to more
digitalised maritime infrastructures and, consequently, [have
necessitated a renewed assessment of the cyber-security]{.mark}
provision]{.underline} \[3\]. Furthermore, [connectivity and reliance on
intelligent devices play a pivotal role in motivating cyber
criminality]{.underline} such as social engineering, identity theft and
spam emails. The protection of the integrity of next generation maritime
infrastructures is a pressing need \[4--7\].

[Connectivity through navigation systems]{.underline} such as Automatic
Identification System (AIS, see Abbreviations), Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) and Radio Detection and Ranging (RADAR) [impacts
negatively on the security level of infrastructures]{.underline}.
Moreover, [[shipping companies have been subjected to **highly
complex**]{.mark} and **new classes of [cyber
attacks]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[targeting]{.underline} **[in-port
info]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[rmation [systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[and inflicting damage on **on-vessel**]{.mark} **core
[equipment]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[8,9\]. [The reliance on the
Internet, operating with unprotected computers, and the fact that crews
do not receive appropriate security training **increase further the
probability of a successful cyber breach**]{.underline}. [[There
is]{.underline} **[clear evidence]{.underline}** [that the absence of
structured **security awareness**]{.underline}]{.mark} [training for
employees across the supply chain [is a **major source of
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}; [as a result, hackers can use
classical approaches]{.underline} such as spam emails or
Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks [to achieve successful
breaches]{.underline} \[10,11\]. A security plan providing
recommendations [to protect the maritime supply chain and a
co-coordinated strategy with international marine organizations is a
near-term necessity]{.underline} \[12\]. The update of software through
removable media increases the risk of stealing identities and in-port
data and the sharing of information in real time using [new
technologies]{.underline}---such as IoT---[exacerbates the risk due to
insecure network services or weak authentication.]{.underline}

#### European ports are particularly vulnerable

**[Muncaster 22]{.underline}** \-\-- Phil Muncaster UK / EMEA News
Reporter, Infosecurity Magazine, "Cyber-Attacks Hobble Some of Europe\'s
Largest Ports", Feb 4^th^ 2022,
https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattacks-hobble-europe-ports/

Oil [[terminals in]{.mark} some of **[Europe's]{.mark} biggest
[ports]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[appear to have been disrupted by
ransomware]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to reports.

[A broker in the region told AFP that the [attacks are disrupting
the]{.mark}]{.underline} oil **[[supply chain.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"[There was a cyber-attack at various terminals, **[quite some terminals
are disrupted]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Jelle Vreeman, senior broker at
Riverlake in Rotterdam, told the newswire.

"[Their [software is being hijacked,]{.mark} and they can't process
barges]{.underline}. Basically, the operational system is down."

The Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil hub, which spans ports across [the
Netherlands and Belgium]{.underline}, is believed to [have borne the
**brunt of the attacks**]{.underline}. AFP cited local Belgian reports
that logistics and storage firm SEA-Tank Terminal is one of those
impacted in Antwerp.

According to a separate report from The Associated Press, at least two
energy companies in the Belgian ports of Antwerp and Ghent were hit by
cyber-attacks, with the government's Federal Computer Crime Unit opening
an investigation.

This follows reports earlier this week that [two German oil logistics
firms were struck by ransomware]{.underline}: Oiltanking GmbH Group and
Mabanaft Group.

[Both [companies were forced to declare force majeure]{.mark}, a legal
clause used in emergencies when companies **[cannot fulfill
their]{.mark} contractual [obligations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

However, the head of Germany's federal office for information security,
Arne Schönbohm, is quoted as saying the incident is serious but "not
grave."

Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell has already admitted it has been forced to
reroute supplies due to the incident.

[The news has uncomfortable echoes of the Colonial Pipeline
attack]{.underline} in May 2021, which crippled oil supplies up and down
the US east coast for days, leading to queues at gas stations.

[This time [the culprit, a]{.mark}t least in the attacks in Germany,
appears to be]{.underline} BlackCat (aka "alphv"), a relatively [**[new
ransomware-as-a-service variant]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

#### Kills billions and causes LNG city attacks on par with nukes

**[Sincai 21]{.underline}** \-\-- Avital co-founded and heads as the COO
in Cydome, Maritime Cyber Attacks Are Among the Greatest Unknown Threats
to the Global Economy, June 28,
https://www.cpomagazine.com/cyber-security/maritime-cyber-attacks-are-among-the-greatest-unknown-threats-to-the-global-economy/

The fact is, [[if the maritime industry **suddenly
disappeared**]{.underline}]{.mark} without a trace, the economic,
social, and political [impacts would be devastating. Billions
of]{.underline} tons of [**[vital]{.underline}**]{.mark} products like
[[**food**, **medicine**]{.underline}]{.mark} and oil are shipped around
the world every year, and if these goods [[stop]{.underline}]{.mark}ped
flowing, [**[billions]{.underline}**]{.mark} of people would
[**[suffer]{.underline}**]{.mark} the consequences. We saw a taste of
this devastation early this year, when a ship lodged itself in the
[[Suez]{.underline}]{.mark} Canal, blocking other ships from getting
through. The incident cost the world nearly \$10 billion in trade each
day it was stuck.

This [is [only a fraction]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of the damage
that could be caused by cyber attacks in the maritime industry.

[[There are various vectors for hackers to]{.underline}]{.mark} attack
which could result in [tak]{.underline}ing full
[[control]{.underline}]{.mark} over a vessel [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
fleet, creating [[damage]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[critical
systems]{.underline}]{.mark} on board or it could just be ransomware or
a malicious virus attempting to take control. In one of the cases, we
have seen that hackers took control of the pipeline and essentially held
it hostage until they were transferred a certain amount of money they
requested. In the end, faced with no other option, the pipeline company
paid \$4.4 million in ransom to the foreign hackers, according to the
Colonial Pipeline CEO.

The hackers then reopened the pipeline, but the damage had already been
done. The Colonial pipeline transferred huge amounts of oil across the
country, and the shutdown caused massive shortages and panic buying. Gas
prices went up across the country as a result of just a few hackers
managing to exploit a vulnerability in the pipeline's system. It's easy
to see from this one incident, how cyber attacks can affect much more
than your personal computer.

Now, it is evident that the greatest cyber threat lies in the maritime
industry. The COVID-19 pandemic sped up the already occurring
digitization of the world, as a result of guidelines that required
people to work from home over the internet. As such, the maritime
industry also had to rely more heavily on the internet than ever before.
You may not think of vessels and fleets as deeply connected with
technology, but vessels are constantly connected to the internet.

Here's where the real problem lies: some of the systems and computers on
these vessels often use incredibly complicated and old systems. This
makes it much harder to protect them from cyber attacks. The systems
that these ships use are so complexly intertwined that there are many
blind spots that are virtually unknowable.

Since the maritime industry is shifting into the digital age, and since
the pandemic has forced it to rely even more heavily on the internet,
there have verifiably been more cyber attacks on vessels recently. In
only the first few months of the pandemic alone, [[attempted]{.mark}
cyber [attacks]{.mark} on maritime vessels **[shot
up]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}by [[**400%**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
This dramatic increase has truly sent a shockwave through the maritime
community. The industry is one of the oldest industries in the world,
and so it was surprising to some, how much they could be affected by
just a few hackers.

Imagine if a hacker took control of a ship that was carrying something
truly vital, like COVID vaccines. At this point, the internet is so
deeply integrated with maritime systems, it would be impossible to
switch to a manual system, so hackers would have full control.The hacker
could shut down the ship for as long they wanted to, and as in the case
of the Colonial pipeline, there is nothing the owner of the vessel could
do but give them whatever it is they were asking for. Significant delays
could cause millions, even billion dollars in economic damage, and have
even more social and political effects.

Imagine if [[a hacker]{.underline}]{.mark} with malevolent intent [[took
control of a]{.mark}n oil [tanker]{.mark}, containing millions of
gallons of flammable liquid, and decided [to do something
terrible]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}with it? We've seen oil spills
before, but [[**LNG** tankers]{.mark} are so dangerous]{.underline} that
[[even]{.mark} a [small]{.mark} amount of [damage]{.mark} could
[cause]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}an [[explosion]{.underline}]{.mark}
[on [**the scale** of a **nuclear bomb**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So what
can we do?

#### Great power war

**[Liu 18]{.underline}** \-\-- Qian Liu is an economist based in China,
The next economic crisis could cause a global conflict. Here\'s why,
https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/11/the-next-economic-crisis-could-cause-a-global-conflict-heres-why/

The [response to the 2008]{.underline} economic [crisis]{.underline} has
[relied far too much on monetary stimulus]{.underline}, in the form of
quantitative easing and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates,
[and]{.underline} included [far too little structural reform.
This]{.underline} [means]{.underline} that [**[the next crisis]{.mark}
could come soon** -- and [**pave the way** for]{.mark} a **[large-scale
military conflict.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The next]{.underline} economic [[crisis]{.mark} is **[closer than you
think]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But [what you should really worry about is
what comes after: in the current]{.underline} social, political, and
technological [landscape]{.underline}, a [prolonged]{.underline}
economic [crisis, combined with rising]{.underline} income
[inequality]{.underline}, [could]{.underline} well [[escalate]{.mark}
[into]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[major global military
conflict.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The 20[08]{.mark}-09 global financial crisis [**almost** bankrupted
governments]{.mark} and caused systemic collapse.]{.underline}
[Policymakers managed to pull the global economy back from the brink,
using massive monetary]{.underline} [stimulus]{.underline}, including
quantitative easing and near-zero (or even negative) interest rates.

But [monetary stimulus is like an **adrenaline shot** to jump-start an
arrested heart; it can revive]{.underline} the patient, [but it does
nothing to cure]{.underline} the disease. [Treating a sick economy
requires structural reforms]{.underline}, which can cover everything
from financial and labor markets to tax systems, fertility patterns, and
education policies.

[Policymakers]{.underline} have [utterly failed to pursue such
reforms]{.underline}, despite promising to do so. Instead, they have
remained preoccupied with politics. From Italy to Germany, forming and
sustaining governments now seems to take more time than actual
governing. And Greece, for example, has relied on money from
international creditors to keep its head (barely) above water, rather
than genuinely reforming its pension system or improving its business
environment.

The [lack of structural reform]{.underline} has [meant]{.underline} that
the **[unprecedented excess liquidity]{.underline}** that [central banks
injected]{.underline} into their economies [was not allocated to its
most efficient uses.]{.underline} [Instead, it raised global asset
prices to levels even **higher than** those prevailing
**before**]{.underline} 20[08.]{.underline}

In the United States, housing prices are now 8% higher than they were at
the peak of the property bubble in 2006, according to the property
website Zillow. The price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which measures
whether stock-market prices are within a reasonable range, is now higher
than it was both in 2008 and at the start of the Great Depression in
1929.

As monetary tightening reveals the vulnerabilities in the real economy,
the [collapse of asset-price bubbles will trigger another [economic
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} -- one that could be even [**[more
severe]{.mark}** than the last, [because we]{.mark} have [built
up]{.mark} a [**tolerance** to our **strongest macroeconomic
medications**]{.mark}. A decade of regular adrenaline shots,
in]{.underline} the form of [ultra-low interest rates and unconventional
monetary policies]{.underline}, has [severely depleted their power to
stabilize and stimulate the economy.]{.underline}

If history is any guide, the [consequences]{.underline} of this mistake
could [extend far beyond the economy. According to
Harvard's]{.underline} Benjamin [Friedman,
[prolonged]{.mark}]{.underline} periods of [economic [distress]{.mark}
have been [characterized]{.mark} also [by]{.mark} public
[**antipathy**]{.mark} toward minority groups or [foreign
countries]{.mark} -- attitudes that]{.underline} can help to [[fuel
**unrest, terrorism**]{.mark},]{.underline} or even
**[[war]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

For example, during the Great Depression, US President Herbert Hoover
signed the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, intended to protect American
workers and farmers from foreign competition. In the subsequent five
years, global trade shrank by two-thirds. Within a decade, World War II
had begun.

To be sure, [WWII, like World War I, was caused by a multitude of
factors]{.underline}; there is no standard path to war.
[But]{.underline} there is reason to believe that [high levels of
inequality can play a significant role in stoking conflict.]{.underline}

According to research by the economist Thomas Piketty, a [spike in
income inequality is often followed by a great crisis. Income
inequality]{.underline} then [declines]{.underline} for a while, [before
rising again, until a new peak -- and]{.underline} a [new
disaster.]{.underline} Though causality has yet to be proven,
[given]{.underline} the [limited]{.underline} number of [data
points]{.underline}, this [**correlation should not be taken lightly**,
especially]{.underline} [with wealth and income inequality at
historically high levels.]{.underline}

[This is]{.underline} all the [**more worrying** in view of the
**numerous other factors** stoking social unrest and diplomatic tension,
including **tech**nological disruption, a record-breaking **migration**
crisis, anxiety over **globalization**, political **polarization**, and
rising **nationalism**.]{.underline} All are symptoms of failed policies
that could turn out to be trigger points for a future crisis.

Voters have good reason to be frustrated, but the [emotionally appealing
**[populists]{.mark}**]{.underline} to whom they are [increasingly
giving]{.underline} their [support are offering ill-advised solutions
that will]{.underline} only [**[make]{.mark} [matters
worse]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For example, despite the world's
unprecedented interconnectedness, [**multilateralism** is increasingly
being **eschewed**]{.underline}, as countries -- [**most
notably**,]{.underline} Donald [Trump's]{.underline} US -- pursue
unilateral, [isolationist policies. Meanwhile, **proxy w**ars are raging
in **Syria** and **Yemen**.]{.underline}

Against this background, [we **must take seriously**]{.underline} the
possibility [that [the next]{.mark} economic [crisis]{.mark} [could lead
to]{.mark} a **[large-scale military
confrontation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} By the logic of the political
scientist Samuel Huntington , considering such a scenario could help us
avoid it, because it would force us to take action. In this case, [the
**key** will be for policymakers to pursue]{.underline} the
**[structural reforms]{.underline}** that they have long promised, while
**[replacing]{.underline}** [finger-pointing and **antagonism**
with]{.underline} a [sensible]{.underline} and [respectful **global
dialogue**. The alternative may well be **[global
conflagration]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Effective information sharing solves every cyber impact \-\-- builds resilience \-\-- but all types of data are key 

**[Balson 20]{.underline}** \-\-- David Balson et al, Director of
Intelligence, Ripjar Technologies, Lead author of "Cyber Information
Sharing: Building Collective Security", World Economic Forum, INSIGHT
REPORT OCTOBER 2020,

[[**Knowledge is power**. Intelligence]{.mark}, carefully
curated]{.underline} from the collection, evaluation and assessment of
data from many sources [[is]{.underline} **[fundamental]{.underline}**
[to understanding the]{.underline}]{.mark} [complex and dynamic
[threats]{.mark} that exist in the information age]{.underline}. Once
only the preserve of government departments and military agencies,
[[intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[helps]{.mark} businesses and
[global institutions make better]{.mark}, data‑driven
[decisions]{.mark}]{.underline}. It gives them the edge in formulating
new plans and strategies to manage risk, and to perform efficiently and
effectively.

[Such is the scale and complexity of the challenge,
[cyberthreats]{.mark} and risks [must be understood **in
detail**]{.mark} [if organizations want to **prevent
breaches**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[prosper]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the age Fourth Industrial
revolution]{.underline}. [Cybersecurity is defined by its
multistakeholder ecosystem and needs to be seen from a holistic
viewpoint. All participants in that ecosystem need to be able to
participate]{.underline} in building the systemic resilience of the
collective infrastructure on which those stakeholders rely.

The scale of the cybersecurity challenge facing global institutions
requires a mindset shift from traditional models for managing business
and security risks. It is no longer feasible to rely on one's own
capabilities; instead [[a]{.mark} step chan[ge will be essential to the
future of]{.mark}]{.underline} business
**[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}**. No single organization has
visibility over the entire problem space, [making]{.underline}
[collaboration and information sharing **essential**.]{.underline}

[[Info]{.mark}rmation [sharing and **having the ability to use it**
]{.mark}helps **[build resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and]{.underline} **[drives collective action]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[[It is]{.underline}]{.mark} one of **[[the most fundamental
tool]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [that an enterprise or organization has to
protect itself]{.underline}. This, however, must be the right type of
information sharing to solve the complex problems. Each security
community is different and must define the fundamental insights required
to protect itself, be this technical information or insights into
strategic behaviours or trends. [[The ability to share]{.mark} the right
insights at the right time in a systematic way with the right
stakeholders [will allow for the **effective protection of
assets**]{.mark}**, intellectual property and business
processes.**]{.underline}

Cyber information sharing as a platform for collective resilience

Cyber [[info]{.mark}rmation [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} is the ability
of an ecosystem to be able to share at scale intelligence with many
different stakeholders to generate the right level of situational
awareness for organizations to defend themselves. By doing this the
ecosystem [[can answer what has been, and what can be done]{.mark} about
malicious activity. [Organizations need]{.mark} to be able to do this in
three key domains:]{.underline}

[1. [Strategic: Info]{.mark}rmation that can help]{.underline}
enterprises [understand the type of threat they are defending against,
the motivation and capability of the threat and the potential
consequences and risks of attacks.]{.underline}

2\. [[Operational: Infor]{.mark}mation that can help enterprises'
decision‑making, resource allocation and task prioritization. It
includes trend analysis showing the technical direction of threat
actors]{.underline} and an understanding of malicious tactics,
techniques and procedures.

3\. [[Technical: Info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} from technical data,
sources and systems that [provide insights that can influence tactical
decisions. This data is typically derived from near real‑time monitoring
and sharing of network information required for adjusting an
organizations security]{.underline}.3

effective policies for [deter]{.mark}ring

policies that emphasize the asymmetric advantage America has in

Most of the discussion of [cyber deterrence focuses on preventing a

lives]{.underline} ([like disruptions to electricity transmission or
clean water]{.underline})---or our way of life---altering election

Atlantic Treaty for the era of cyberattacks. [In the latest effort to
collectively impose costs on adversaries, the]{.underline} 2018
[[NATO]{.mark} Summit saw a commitment from heads of state and
government "to integrate sovereign cyber effects, provided voluntarily
by Allies, into Alliance operations and missions]{.underline}, in the
framework of strong political oversight." [The newly updated White House
National Cyber Strategy likewise [envisions working together]{.mark}
with a "coalition of like-minded states" to "ensure adversaries
understand the consequences of]{.underline} their [malicious cyber
behavior."]{.underline}

**[[Therein lies the rub]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Both formal [alliances,
such as [NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}, and more ad hoc arrangements, such
as what the Cyber Deterrence Initiative imagines, will
[**[require]{.underline}** [members to share
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline} eventually, to the
best of their ability and perhaps in different domains, [contribute to
joint action against a presumably well-armed foreign
aggressor]{.underline}. States including the United States, the United
Kingdom, the Netherlands, Estonia, and Denmark have publicly declared
their willingness to lend sovereign offensive cyber effects to deter,
defend against and counter the full spectrum of threats.

[[Sharing]{.mark} intelligence and information [is a **key
element**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of NATO's core decision-making
process]{.mark} enshrined **[in Article 4]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the
Washington Treaty. Political consultations are part of the preventive
diplomacy between member states, [but they are also an avenue to discuss
concerns related to the security threats member states face. [These
consultations can be a catalyst for reaching a
consensus]{.mark}]{.underline} [[on policies to be adopted or actions to
be taken]{.mark}---including those on the use of sovereign cyber effects
to support a NATO operation.]{.underline}

[The alliance has a track record of collective action and cooperative
security measures]{.underline}. For example, Operation Active Endeavour
helped to deter, disrupt and protect against terrorist activity in the
Mediterranean in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, in
solidarity with the United States. For the seventh time, the Atlantic
Council's Cyber Statecraft Initiative will be among the organizations
privileged to organize an event on the sidelines of the Feb. 15--17
Munich Security Conference. This year in particular, the Atlantic
Council's event, "Defending Human Dignity: Limiting Malicious Cyber
Activity Through Diplomacy," will complement the topics high on the
agenda of the main conference, such as transatlantic collaboration, the
consequences of a resurgence of great power competition and the future
of arms control.

[In the United States, the greatest failures of response and deterrence
to]{.underline} foreign [aggression in cyberspace have not been caused
by a lack of intelligence, capability or imagination. Rather, U[.S.
policy has been serviceable]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in theory
but]{.underline} **[impotent in practice]{.underline}** [because of an
**inability**]{.underline} [to translate]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[technical]{.mark} findings** and [**intelligence** into public
support]{.mark} for]{.underline} sufficiently [tough
responses]{.underline} ordered by elected political leaders. [[North
Korea's repeated operations]{.mark} targeting]{.underline} U.S.
[companies and critical infrastructure have been met with public
skepticism over their culpability]{.underline}, limiting the strength of
retaliatory options needed to deter further events. [[Chinese
cyber]{.mark} economic [espionage]{.mark} continued for years despite
widespread knowledge of China's activities because political leaders
found it difficult to confront Beijing]{.underline} without undermining
U.S. companies in return. [[Russian information operations]{.mark} did
not sow enough doubt to mislead experts, but they succeeded in
exacerbating the partisan polarization of]{.underline} an
already-divided electorate and its [leaders]{.underline}.

[[That inability to translate the findings]{.mark} of cyber experts
[into public sentiment]{.mark}]{.underline} and therefore political
action [[has]{.underline} **[sidelined America's
cyberwarriors]{.underline}**]{.mark}[, by far the most technologically
advanced and well-resourced in the world]{.underline}. Imagine the
political response of an ally that is asked to burden-share in response
to cyber aggression but is probably much closer to any resulting kinetic
fight than the United States.

Now [[imagine the]{.mark} response of that [ally]{.mark} when it's
[being asked to **take causus belli on faith**]{.mark}]{.underline}:
[[The United States]{.mark} is [presenting attribution for a
cyberattack]{.mark} elsewhere in the world, but]{.underline} perhaps
[[is depending on the ally **lacking critical details due to
classification**,]{.mark} and is presenting that information alongside a
request for help that might well put the ally in the crosshairs of its
own cyberattack]{.underline} or lethal action[. [How can allies with
different capabilities to collect]{.underline}]{.mark}[, analyze [and
understand intelligence **be part of a consensus**]{.mark} on using
sovereign cyber effects to support a NATO operation? [How can a
commander achieve a]{.mark} common [operational picture]{.mark} to
authorize the use of sovereign effects in a NATO operation [if **all the
allies** are not on the same page]{.mark} with respect to critical
attribution and other technical info]{.underline}rmation [needed for a
use of effect in an operation? We all know what a tank looks
like]{.underline} on a shared satellite image, [but if you ask three
cyber experts to interpret the attribution for a set of indicators, you
are likely to get **at least four answers.**]{.underline}

[[For]{.underline}]{.mark} most [[U.S. allies in
Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} and elsewhere, [[there is simply a **dearth
of technical know-how**]{.underline}]{.mark} within the government
[[when it comes to cyber attribution]{.underline}]{.mark} and
operations. T[his is already a challenge for the United
States,]{.underline} with a massive defense budget, Silicon Valley
innovation and an educated workforce to pull into government service.
[But for many U.S. allies, tech-savvy public servants will have long
fled for the private sector]{.underline}, nongovernmental organizations
(NGOs) and academia [before reaching ministerial positions.]{.underline}

To its credit, [[the U.S.]{.mark} National Cyber Strategy [does
**propose capacity-building measures**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to support
allies]{.underline}.]{.mark} [This means **building up law enforcement,
intelligence, and military operational and investigative
capability**]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} even with
successful capacity-building programs, [[many nations could,]{.mark} in
a crisis, [end up]{.mark} in the same place the United States is---with
[good options stuck on the shelf while political
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} and their electorates [[lack a critical
mass]{.underline}]{.mark} of informed voters [[to **trust**,]{.mark}
understand and act on expert [findings]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[For countries weighing whether to risk their own blood and treasure in
support of an ally's cyber attribution findings, [this hurdle could
**well prove insurmountable**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[if not addressed
**well before a crisis emerges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Many such
countries will no doubt recall being burned when placing too much
confidence in U.S. technical and human sources]{.underline} without an
ability to evaluate the evidence for themselves, **[as with the Iraq
weapons of mass destruction findings]{.underline}**.

The private sector will probably play a crucial role in providing
intelligence to support alliance responses to cyberattacks, especially
as a stopgap over the next few years. FireEye and its peer competitors
and partners regularly produce analyses of major world cyber
events---many that fly below the radar of Western leadership, in
fact---sometimes at a near-government quality and often covering much of
the same "classified" evidence.

More important, private-sector analysts are accustomed to writing for
impact with both their technical counterparts, like chief information
security officers (CISOs) and threat hunters, and nontechnical
stakeholders such as boards of directors, CEOs and other persons
controlling the purse strings. In this sense, unclassified,
private-sector and NGO-driven cyber threat intelligence can become the
lingua franca of discussions. Relying on commercial reporting generated
by international teams, rather than declassified government-generated
reports, both broadens the audience enough to make alliance discussions
feasible and mitigates against disparities in terminology across
national lines---the tendency of even closely integrated allies to
describe cyber "attack," "information operations," and attribution
findings with different implicit assumptions or implications.

Long-Term Thinking

[In the long run, though, [the U.S.]{.mark} and its more technologically
advanced allies]{.underline}---such as its fellow Five Eyes (Australia,
Canada, New Zealand and the U.K.), France and Japan---[[will have to
make]{.mark} **important [policy changes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in the
interests of **furthering alliance coop**]{.mark}**eration [in
cyberspace]{.mark}**]{.underline}[: [a willingness
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [sometimes [risk]{.mark} sensitive [sources and
methods in order to get cyber threat intelligence into the hands of
other countries]{.mark} better positioned to take policy action, **[an
end to classifying]{.mark}** public information like IP addresses solely
because of their acquisition via classified means, and greater
transparency on their own decision-making.]{.underline}

Government cyber leaders within the alliance should consider taking
another page out of the private-sector playbook as well: running
cyber-crisis exercises that involve more than the IT department. In the
commercial world, the more successful practice runs involve leaders at
both the CISO level and some presence from nontechnical teams that would
weigh in during a crisis, such as communications and legal. The best
exercises involve executives, too, who despite their busy schedules must
see for themselves how their companies would survive and respond during
a potentially ruinous cyberattack, and work through the minutiae of
leading a response themselves. The experience and confidence is
invaluable if ever called on during a real-life crisis, and the
organizational introspection by involving decision-makers at all levels
is irreplaceable.

Military-to-military cyber training as part of cross-country force
standardization and joint operational planning could pull in more senior
national leadership, beyond battlefield commanders, and be coupled with
increased funding for foreign affairs-led training for nontechnical
leaders.

The private sector could also meaningfully contribute during NATO
consultations when developing Allied Joint Publications to make sure
that definitions and requirements for threat intelligence incorporate
the best practices of NATO member countries' private sectors. If a U.S.
diplomat reaches out to his or her counterpart in an allied country to
ask for assistance responding to malware that's damaging critical
infrastructure, and that counterpart has to ask what malware is, the
response isn't going to happen.

\*\*\*

[[NATO]{.mark}'s essential and enduring purpose is to safeguard the
freedom and security of all its members]{.underline} by political and
military means. [Tolerating cyberattacks]{.underline}, especially those
deliberately targeting civilians and the political legitimacy of
governments---[[without]{.mark} the alliance having the [capability to
**jointly discuss attribution**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and have the
confidence to act]{.underline} and assist one
another---**[[undermines]{.mark} this [core purpose of the
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Likewise, pursuing only deterrence and
response without an active role for the alliance in reaching peaceful
diplomatic agreements with potential adversaries abrogates member
responsibilities to their citizens but is impossible without a common
language and operational picture to discuss enforcement of such
agreements. [The U.S. is stronger with allies, and with attention to
these issues its cybersecurity can be too.]{.underline}

#### Second \-\-- Hostile actors will use ambiguity to undermine NATO cohesion \-\-- attribution through intelligence sharing is essential to collective response and deterrence 

**[Christian 20]{.underline}** \-\-- Joshua D. Christian, M.A. in
Strategic Studies from Naval Postgraduate School, "RUSSIAN CYBER
OPERATIONS TO DESTABILIZE NATO", Thesis Paper, June 2020,
https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1114628.pdf

[[Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} apparent [[interest in destabilizing
NATO]{.mark} at the strategic level]{.underline} [**likely [entails
degrading]{.mark}** [relationships]{.mark}]{.underline} not only within
the Alliance but also **[[within]{.mark} individual states of [the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Karlsen notes that [promoting division
within the Alliance is what Western security institutions believe to be
a key goal of Russian cyber operations]{.underline}.323 Due to this,
[cyber [attribution is a critical aspect of responding to a
cyber]{.mark} [operation]{.mark} and [NATO needs to **denounce**
and]{.mark} **openly [attribute blame to the
provocateur]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a cyber operation. [Open
[attribution]{.mark} places the aggressor state in the international
spotlight which [works to deter that state from future
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is the recommendation of this author
that NATO adjust its posture and demonstrate a willingness to denounce
any cyber activity that experts believe is from Russia. The case studies
demonstrate the significant challenge to investigate and accurately
attribute responsibility for cyberattacks. [It is the recommendation for
policy makers to conduct ongoing research and analyze findings to guide
countermeasures and training]{.underline}.

Currently, not all NATO states are as willing as the United States to
attribute blame for a cyber operation. The French presidential election
provided documented evidence that resulted in the U.S. government's
willingness to blame Russia; in contrast, the French government
refrained from directly attributing the cyber operation to Russia.324
[[In order to **strengthen the Alliance**]{.mark} and its position as a
leading institution, [NATO leaders are encouraged to]{.mark} evaluate
future events and [require **collective recognition and
responses**]{.mark}]{.underline} to Russian cyber operations. A
[[collective]{.underline}]{.mark} response and
[[agreement]{.underline}]{.mark} from all of the NATO states, [in
response to a cyber operation against one member, displa[ys a **unity
within the Alliance that further strengthens
NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[A unified NATO response
demonstrates a strong Alliance that will minimize Russia's ability to
create division]{.mark} within the states and an Alliance that is
prepared to respond to any threat.]{.underline}

2\. Determine NATO Threshold for Response and Retaliation

[The NATO Alliance is centered around the Article 5 commitment to
collective defense]{.underline} from a conventional attack. In 2019,
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg affirmed that "a serious
cyberattack could trigger Article 5."325 This is an evolving stance on
cyberattacks that the Alliance did not demonstrate during previous
incidents of Russian cyber operations analyzed in this thesis. Russia
was able to carry out those cyber operations with minimal repercussions
due to the issue of attribution. Following a systematic intelligence
gathering and review, the NATO Alliance will be better equipped to
determine the threshold for an Article 5 response. Creating and
implementing NATO guidelines and strategies to evaluate, identify, and
respond to cyber threats, allows NATO the ability to compare and
contrast previous attacks against present threats to determine
thresholds in each case. NATO should then publish a statement that all
NATO member states have come together to determine the threshold for a
cyber Article 5 response and are committed as an Alliance to respond to
such an attack. Determining a threshold and then reaffirming commitment
to retaliating to an Article 5 attack extends the longstanding strength
of the Alliance, which in turns solidifies its legitimacy as an
institution.

[[Not **every cyber threat**]{.mark} **or cyberattack**]{.underline}
[[will warrant an Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline} response, [[but in
order to display]{.mark} the [strength and commitment]{.mark} of the
Alliance, [a measured response is a critical tactic from the
Alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Russian [attempts to interfere with
the domestic electoral proceedings]{.underline} of a
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} member the Alliance **[c[ould invoke Article
4]{.mark}]{.underline}** which states "The Parties will consult together
whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity,
political independence or security of any of the Parties is
threatened."326 This allows the Alliance to come up with a unified
response to a threat to a member state. [Cyber operations involving
influence operations or critical infrastructure threats warrant
**individual evaluation**]{.underline}. NATO needs to develop guidelines
for responding to cyber operations against member states that handle
operations on a case by case basis. [Not all operations are undertaken
for the same purpose and therefore require strategic responses. NATO has
exercised responses to issues below the threshold of Article 5 for
conventional matters]{.underline}; implementing guidelines and
strategies in response to a cyber threat below this threshold would
strengthen the legitimacy of NATO in cyber while deterring future
adversaries.

3\. Strengthen Intelligence Sharing Cooperation

[[Intelligence sharing is a **key element of any
alliance**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and NATO [member states are obligated
to]{.mark} continually **[improve and strengthen intelligence
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Greater
coop]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration between NATO states [strengthens the
Alliance as well as prepares states to defend]{.mark} against cyber
operations while **[creating a deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.
[Greater intelligence coop]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration [will lead to
further **strengthening NATO resiliency and
defense**]{.mark}]{.underline} as specified in Article 3 which states
"In order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this Treaty, the
Parties, separately and jointly, by means of continuous and effective
self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and
collective capacity to resist armed attack."327 [Cooperation and
[collaboration]{.mark} between partner states [makes it **more
difficult** for an adversary]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as Russia, [[to
carry out a cyber operation]{.mark} against a NATO state]{.underline}.
In the French presidential election, the U.S. government was able to
communicate with the French government to alert it to Russian cyber
activity meant to interfere in the election.328 [[Continual intelligence
sharing between NATO]{.mark} members [enables them to design and
implement cyber defenses]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[resulting in a
stronger Alliance.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

[**[Cooperation]{.mark}** between NATO states [is **crucial** to
strengthening cyber defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}; additionally, it is
critical that policies identify cooperation between state and private
entities. Private cybersecurity firms as well as areas of critical
infrastructure of a state need to work closely with government agencies
to create a stronger defense network. Dragonfly wasfirst discovered by
cybersecurity firm Symantec, a discovery which led to governments being
able to track the cyber operation back to the Russian government.329
Private entities may discover suspicious cyber activity and through
close cooperation with government agencies could deter, defend, and even
attribute cyber operations before an attack or effective information
operation could take place. Intelligence sharing and cooperation within
a NATO state can then be taken to the Alliance to be shared with other
states and private entities. [Close collaboration and [intelligence
sharing benefits the Alliance and **further strengthens its commitment
to the defense of NATO states.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Unity solves nuclear war

**[The Economist 22]{.underline}** \-\-- "In Ukraine, Biden must relearn
Truman's lessons from the cold war", March 26^th^ 2022,
<https://www.economist.com/united-states/2022/03/26/in-ukraine-biden-must-relearn-trumans-lessons-from-the-cold-war>

[[America]{.underline}]{.mark} once again [[seeks to **curb Russia and
China without blowing up the world**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Joe biden entered the White House last year styling himself on Franklin
Roosevelt. The better model today might be Harry Truman. His words to
Congress 75 years ago this month---"It must be the policy of the United
States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation
by armed minorities or by outside pressures"---girded America for the
cold war. Those words have a new resonance as Ukraine, helped by the
West, battles to resist Russia's month-old invasion.

As in the 1940s and 50s, [the world is separating into distinct
blocs]{.underline}. The Eurasian giants, [Russia]{.underline} and
[China]{.underline}, are again making common cause. [[America is seeking
to counter them by **mustering allies**]{.underline}]{.mark} around
their periphery, from Europe to Japan. Truman's [America]{.underline}
was [engaged in [a]{.mark}]{.underline} fight against communism; Mr
Biden sees a **[[global contest against
autocracy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The cold-war strategy of "containment"
is being studied for the current age.

**[This [arouses dread, but also hope.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[Dread,
because]{.mark} of the]{.underline} return of war in Europe, [renewed
big-power confrontation and [the **increased risk of nuclear
conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Hope, because]{.underline}]{.mark}
Russia's military incompetence, Ukraine's valour and [**the West's
newfound [unity raise confidence]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the
American-led [liberal order **can prevail.**]{.mark}]{.underline}
Writing in American Purpose, an online magazine, Francis Fukuyama of
Stanford University, who in an earlier bout of optimism coined the
notion of the "end of history" about the demise of the Soviet Union,
goes so far as to predict that Ukraine will inflict "outright defeat" on
Russia and make possible a "new birth of freedom".

Mr [[Biden's]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy will become clearer in the
coming days. On March 24th he was [due to take part in a trio of
summits]{.underline} in Brussels with the leaders of nato, the European
Union and the g7. [The signs are he [will **steel the allies for a long
struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} "[This war will]{.underline}
**[not end easily or rapidly]{.underline}**," said Jake Sullivan, his
national security adviser, on March 22nd. [The West would stand by
Ukraine "**for as long as it takes**]{.underline}".

Another signal will be the president's request for more defence spending
in the coming financial year, expected to be sent to Congress next week.
A succession of formal strategy documents---for national security,
defence and nuclear posture---will follow after hurried redrafting. For
Robert Gates, a former American defence secretary, the war "has ended
Americans' 30-year holiday from history". [[Ahead lies a]{.mark}
[two-front contest, against both Russia and China]{.mark}. "A new
American strategy must recognise that we face a global struggle of
indeterminate duration against two great powers that share
authoritarianism at home and hostility to the United
States]{.underline}," he wrote in the Washington Post.

Strategists are reaching for the annals of the cold war. Is Vladimir
Putin's invasion akin to the Soviet Union's blockade of Berlin in 1948,
the start of the Korean war in 1950 or the Cuban missile crisis of 1962?
Some are re-reading George Kennan, the American diplomat whose "long
telegram" from Moscow in 1946 set the intellectual foundation for
containment. American "unalterable counterforce", Kennan argued in a
later essay, could hasten "either the break-up or the gradual mellowing
of Soviet power". In practice containment involved more than the
high-minded means Kennan imagined, such as the Marshall plan to rebuild
Europe. It also involved coercive instruments: military alliances and
build-ups, nuclear standoffs, proxy wars and much else short of a direct
conflict.

Dean Acheson, Truman's secretary of state, wrote that America's task
after 1945 was "just a bit less formidable than that described in the
first chapter of Genesis. That was to create a world out of chaos; ours,
to create half a world, a free half, out of the same material without
blowing the whole to pieces in the process."

Mr [Biden's [burden is to prevent the world from **reverting to
chaos**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and to preserve]{.underline} **[as much
of the free portion as possible]{.underline}**.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} today may be a lesser foe than the Soviet
Union, "a wounded empire" rather than a superpower
[[with]{.underline}]{.mark} a global ideology and a semi-autarkic
economic hinterland, as Eliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins University notes.
Yet [[China]{.underline} [is a]{.underline}
**[great]{.underline}**]{.mark}er [[challenger]{.underline}]{.mark}, not
least in economic terms. Its navy is already larger than America's, and
**[it is [fast expanding its nuclear
arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

To judge Mr Biden, then, consider three measures: first, how he deals
with Russia; in the longer term, how he confronts China; and,
throughout, how he carries his profoundly polarised country.

Vladimir the terrible

Team Biden had no illusions about Russia. Its early warning about the
invasion of Ukraine, and its release of intelligence about the Kremlin's
plans, were innovative and prescient. It denied Mr Putin a pretext, and
primed allies to respond forcefully, both by arming Ukraine and by
imposing severe sanctions on Russia. Like Mr Putin, however, Mr Biden
may have underestimated Ukraine. On the eve of war America seemed to
think that, at best, Ukraine might become another Iraq or Afghanistan,
easy to invade but hard to control. Instead Russia has found it
surprisingly arduous to take Ukraine's cities, even as it pulverises
them. The longer the horrors go on, the greater the cries for the world
to stop them.

[At their summits in Europe, the Western allies will resolve to
strengthen]{.underline} nato's defences, [provide more weapons to
Ukraine and increase economic pressure]{.underline} on Russia. Above
all, [American officials say, they will stiffen their sinews for a long
contest as economic pain spreads.]{.underline}

[How far dare the allies go]{.underline} in waging a proxy war against a
nuclear power? **[The answer keeps shifting]{.underline}**. In 2014,
when Russia took a first chunk of Ukraine, America declined to provide
weapons. It later began to deliver anti-tank missiles. Now it is
shipping small anti-aircraft weapons and drones. Soon it may facilitate
the supply of longer-range air-defence missiles.

Yet there are limits. When Mr Biden vows that America will defend "every
inch" of nato's territory he declares, in effect, that American forces
will not defend any inch of Ukraine's. To get involved directly, says Mr
Biden, would be "World War III". He has refused calls to impose a no-fly
zone over Ukraine, act as the intermediary for Polish mig-29 jets or
even supply American-made Patriot anti-aircraft batteries.

The point at which America becomes a "co-combatant" will not be decided
by lawyers but, ultimately, by Russia. The Kremlin has given notice that
arms convoys to Ukraine would be legitimate targets. It has bombed sites
close to Poland.

History suggests the boundaries of proxy conflicts can be dangerously
fuzzy. Chinese "volunteer" forces fought against American troops in the
Korean war of 1950-53, when America considered using atom bombs against
them. Russians manned anti-aircraft batteries and, perhaps, flew
missions against American aircraft in the Vietnam war of 1955-75.

"During the cold war the United States and the Soviet Union were at
daggers drawn but usually did not stab each other directly," explains
Richard Fontaine of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank
in Washington. Mr Putin has rattled his nuclear sabre, but American
officials say they have detected no change in Russia's nuclear posture,
nor have they changed theirs.

Mr Biden's caution in Ukraine contrasts with his almost careless talk
about defending Taiwan against China. Last year Mr Biden said America
had a "commitment" to defend the island. America's "strategic
ambiguity", whereby it promises to help Taiwan defend itself but will
not say whether it would intervene directly, has become less ambiguous.

Nobody can say quite why America seems readier to risk "World War III"
for Taiwan than for Ukraine. Perhaps the danger in Ukraine is
concentrating minds. Some note that America has no alliance with
Ukraine, a non-nato country, whereas it has a semi-obligation to Taiwan.
The island's important semiconductor industry is a consideration. The
main reason is that America considers China, not Russia, to be the
greatest danger.

"[[Russia is the acute threat]{.mark}. But [China is the pacing
challenge]{.mark}, the only country able to challenge the United States
systemically]{.underline}," says a senior American official. "Nothing
about the crisis in Ukraine has changed that." Or, as one diplomat puts
it, "[Ukraine is the tsunami; China is climate change." [America's
response in Europe **contributes to
alliance-building**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} says the envoy; [it
will **expect Europeans to help in Asia.**]{.underline}

The fact that [Australia, Japan and other Asian countries have imposed
sanctions on Russia is a sign of their fears about the war's wider
repercussions]{.underline}. [American military chiefs have warned that a
[Chinese invasion of Taiwan **could happen before the end of the
decade**. A successful Russian attack]{.mark} on [Ukraine]{.mark} might
have [emboldened China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Now that Russia is bogged
down, the danger may have receded.

[Russia and China have declared that their friendship has "no
limits".]{.underline} America is hoping that Xi Jinping, China's leader,
will now have second thoughts. In a video summit on March 18th Mr Biden
issued a threat to impose sanctions on China if it came to Russia's aid.
One [aim of]{.underline} Mr [Biden's]{.underline} trip this week [is to
push Europeans to deliver **the same message**]{.underline} at the
eu-China summit on April 1st. China maintains the fiction that it is
neutral, so could in theory distance itself from Russia. Few in
Washington think Mr Xi is prepared to let Mr Putin fail. But America now
sees "an opportunity to deal a strategic blow to Russia, and an
opportunity to make Russia increasingly a strategic burden for China,"
the official says.

analysis focuses on the intelligence- and information-gathering and
strategic communication aspects of IO. [Intelligence- and
information-gathering are critical to identify Russia's]{.mark} hybrid
[options and intent and to mobilize NATO member states]{.mark} toward
the activity.]{.underline} Conversely, [strategic communication is a
proactive, comprehensive defense measure to specifically limit Russian
hybrid options and to broadcast the costs Russia would incur if it moved
forward with them.]{.underline}

[[For intelligence-gathering to be effective]{.underline}]{.mark} in
today's operating environment, [[countries must be willing to
break]{.mark} down [stovepipes]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[and]{.mark}
widely [share info]{.mark}rmation [with]{.mark}in]{.underline}** their
own government structures as well as with
**[[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** and partners. [The coordinated actions
of [hybrid war]{.mark}fare [allow Russia to exploit]{.mark} regional,
national, and international [seams]{.mark}. [Building
**intelligence-sharing apparatuses**]{.mark}]{.underline} both within
and without ministries among and across countries [[helps]{.mark} to
[close]{.mark} those [seams]{.mark}]{.underline}. Effective
intelligence-sharing could occur at levels ranging from
joint/multinational collection teams to finished intelligence analysis
at ministerial or national levels. In other words, information-sharing
does not always have to be top-down driven; sometimes bottom-up is
effective.

One [goal of [shared intelligence]{.mark} is to [reduce the time
required for NATO to consult and respond]{.mark} in part or as a whole.
This effort could be facilitated by a common intelligence picture shared
by all parties.]{.underline} **[[Partial, inconsistent, or stovepiped
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark}** [might]{.underline} **[[slow NATO's
response process]{.underline}]{.mark}** by [[creating]{.mark} [doubt or
failing to correctly attribute]{.mark} malign
[activity]{.mark}]{.underline} to the Russian government. In addition,
[whether internal to a state or between allied states, [stovepiping
challenges coordinated action against hybrid war]{.mark}fare. **[Better
intelligence-sharing would allow states to deny
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} the benefit of using IO techniques in
[hybrid warfare]{.underline} to isolate specific states or populations.
[[A common intelligence picture]{.mark} also [makes it more
likely]{.mark},]{.underline} for example, [[that a Russian intelligence
operative]{.mark} or team preparing to assassinate a dissident [would be
identified and detained]{.mark}, and have the network and messaging
compromised. [An example of intelligence-sharing success]{.mark} within
NATO nations [against hybrid activity is the Baltic Special
Op]{.mark}erations Forces Intelligence Fusion Cell]{.underline}, a
budding Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, and Polish initiative that
operates with assistance from the United States.20 If implemented
properly, [such intelligence fusion cells might provide key indications
and warnings of Russian hybrid warfare operations across the spectrum of
IO, [denying Russia the benefit of being able to claim
noninvolvement]{.mark}/noninterference [and]{.mark} could [serve as a
template for future initiatives]{.mark} among other Allies and
partners.]{.underline} Furthermore, [such fusion cells provide a path
for connecting information across the Alliance's multiple stovepipes,
that is, the intra- and inter-bureaucratic inertia and the multilingual
nature of the [information]{.mark} environment. This [enables]{.mark} a
common intelligence picture and, consequently, the ability of the
[Allies to collectively deny Russian IO to access seams unfettered and
without attribution.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Once Russian hybrid warfare IO activity is recognized and NATO agrees a
response is appropriate, strategic communication would likely be
employed]{.underline} as the principal countermeasure and vanguard to
prevent Russian activity. [[The situational awareness derived from the
shared information]{.mark} and intelligence discussed in the previous
section [would be **critical to crafting targeted
messages**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Strategic communication
would]{.underline} likely [be]{.underline} split between two audiences:
external actors and an audience internal to the conflict (that is, the
targeted population). Internal strategic communication efforts should
focus on countering the information aspect of hybrid warfare. Prior to a
campaign, successful strategic communication might limit the
vulnerability to target audiences, such as the Russian-speaking
minorities of the Baltic states, or a Russian hybrid campaign. This is
[achieved by [negating Russia's plausible deniability]{.mark} concerning
the sponsorship of the conflict's version of "little green men" (or
whatever the aggressor looks like in that campaign]{.underline}).
Internal strategic messaging [[campaigns]{.underline} **[must be swiftly
organized]{.underline}**]{.mark} and executed [[because they are most
effective if they prevent Russia from gaining a]{.mark} tactical
[advantage during the initial "fog of war"]{.mark} period. Once a hybrid
warfare campaign has begun, the focus of external strategic
communication should be to expose Russian activities to
NATO]{.underline} (and the rest of the world). [[This]{.mark} might
underm[ine Russian public support for such activities, would inform
decisionmakers]{.mark} during NATO deliberations, [and]{.mark} should
**[unite the international community against the malign
actor.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Moreover, the absence of a mechanism to share NATO classified

[[is a]{.underline}]{.mark}nother [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}. For

through the NAC[. The reservations of some allies to discuss their own

[**[exacerbate NATO's organizational impediments to addressing hybrid

[Much of the debate on]{.underline} new "[[hybrid" threats has revolved
around]{.underline}]{.mark} "little green men" and other [[grey
zone]{.mark} military tactics, or hybrid warfare, essentially a military
approach to conducting "indirect war"]{.underline} under special
circumstances.4 [The more pressing challenges from a Western perspective
are [the]{.mark} more subtle[, non-military activities deployed by
authoritarian regimes]{.mark} to **[penetrate democratic
society]{.mark}.**]{.underline} "[Hybrid interference" is a concept
developed to capture non-military practices for the mostly covert
manipulation of other states' strategic interests]{.underline}.5 As
such, [it bears resemblance to what was referred to as "**active
measures**]{.underline}" [during the Cold War and, more recently, in
Russian strategic debate]{.underline} as gibridnaya voyna.

[[The idea]{.underline}]{.mark} of gibridnaya voyna [[is to
avoid]{.mark} the traditional battlefield with the aim of
[destroyi]{.mark}ng "[the political cohesion of an adversary]{.mark}
from the inside by employing a carefully crafted hybrid of non-military
means and methods that amplify political, ideological, economic and
other social polarisations]{.underline} [within an adversary's
society]{.underline}, thus **[[leading to its internal
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**."6 While keeping diplomatic relations
intact, and thus not breaking any official threshold of war, [[the
aggressor mobilizes **oppositionists and radicals**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[within the target state through a host of means ranging from
disinformation campaigns to corrupting political actors and [financing
subversive movements]{.mark}]{.underline}, carefully **[[synchronized to
compound the effect]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[Hybrid interference]{.mark} avoids]{.underline} the use of overt
[kinetic [means]{.mark}]{.underline} **[in order to maintain [plausible
deniability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Yet, it may include the use of
targeted violence, through proxies, to inject fear and exploit emotional
pressure points in the target society. In 2014, for example,
pro-democracy protesters in Taiwan were attacked by some with links to
the Chinese Communist Party to incite political tensions and undermine
democratic governability.7 In Montenegro, Moscow instigated a coup
attempt before the 2016 elections. The attempt involved harnessing its
close relations to the Orthodox Church and the Serb minority population
to foment distrust in the democratic process and, in the final phase,
using Russian intelligence operatives disguising as police officers to
create disruption by shooting protesters and blaming the Montenegrin
government for killing innocents.8

[[Central to hybrid interference is **subversion**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Subversion]{.mark} refers to an aggressor state's purposeful attempt
to destabilize and undermine the authority of a target
state]{.underline} by using local proxy actors.9 [It specifically
[involves the use of **disinformation**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
economic inducements to recruit and assist these actors inside the
target country, [detach their loyalties from the target government, and
use them as interlocutors to transform the established social order and
its structures of authority and norms. The [aim is to **weaken
democratic governance and norms**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as a means of
**enhancing their own authoritarian standing**]{.mark}**.** Not only are
[**weakened democracies** less able to]{.mark} directly [confront these
authoritarian aggressors, but they will also look less **appealing as
models of success and partners for others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By
portraying Western democracies as corrupt and ungovernable,
authoritarian regimes such as China, Iran, Russia, and Turkey are less
at risk of being overthrown by their own populations.]{.underline}

[As such, hybrid interference is designed as a flexible approach in
which the tools and tactics can vary but will always be tailored to
manipulate existing cleavages and sow internal dissension in target
countries and alliances]{.underline}. Hybrid interference does not adopt
a one-size-fits-all approach but exploits specific vulnerabilities
depending on the context in the target country. The hybrid aggressor
interferes in domestic politics by seeking to amplify divisions and
hatred, undermining the "civic culture" that has been found to be so
important for democratic governability by tempering the intensity of
political conflicts and cleavages.10

The migrant crisis in Europe offered an excellent opportunity for
authoritarian aggressors. By exposing rifts between "liberals" and
"anti-liberals," it allowed Russia and Turkey to leverage refugees as a
disruptive force, fanning the already simmering political tensions in
Europe. Following the outbreak of the Syrian civil war, Russia and
Turkey began actively pushing migrants over the borders to Europe, while
simultaneously engaging in disinformation campaigns by playing up
rumored (or actual) misdeeds by immigrants and portraying European
governments as unwilling or unable to manage the influx of people.11 To
compound the polarizing effect, Russia also began channeling money to
anti-immigrant and anti-EU political parties and movements such as
France's National Front.12 In this way, particularly Russia has
contributed to Europe's surge in anti-immigrant sentiments and populist
support, as well as rising democratic dissatisfaction.13

Democratic Deterrence as a Novel Strategy

[[Western democracies **urgently** need to find counter measures]{.mark}
against hybrid interference, recognizing that traditional military
deterrence only works against predominantly military threats.
[By]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[reducing clarity about who is doing
what]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [or]{.underline} **[even whether somebody
is actually doing anything]{.underline}**, [[hybrid interference
**complicates**]{.underline}]{.mark} traditional
[**[deterrence]{.mark}**.]{.underline}14 [[Yet]{.mark}, the
**[attribution]{.mark} problem [is not
insurmountable]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [The responsibility for
interfering in US elections, for example, was traced and attributed to
Russia, though only after a painstaking process involving much
controversy and resources]{.underline}.15 But the question, then, even
after the attribution problem is solved, becomes what to do about it?
[Any prudent deterrence posture needs to avoid unnecessary escalation,
and a military response to political interference does not seem
proportional.]{.underline}

[The strategic concept of democratic deterrence suggests a novel way of
thinking about deterrence]{.underline} to dissuade these hybrid
interference activities by authoritarian states. Table 1 summarizes the
differences between traditional military deterrence and democratic
deterrence.

\<Table Omitted\>

[First, in contrast to traditional deterrence that is state-based,
democratic deterrence rests on a whole-of-society approach]{.underline},
albeit one in which the state retains a coordinating role. It harnesses
market- and society-based actors in an effort to pull together resources
and take full advantage of democracy's societal strengths and cultural
capital. This difference is important because in this new era of
subversive politics, where the classical Westphalian dichotomy between
internal and external state affairs has been blurred, deterrence is
harder to achieve by state action alone. [[Deterring hybrid interference
requires a whole-of-society response whereby various societal actors
build resilience capacities,]{.mark} support the state in maintaining
preparedness, and ensure the continuity of vital societal functions and
supply lines.]{.underline} For instance, private actors often own full
or partial stakes in critical infrastructure such as energy pipelines,
undersea cables, railways, banking and finance, health services, and
food supply. Ensuring that they live up to their responsibilities with
regard to safety measures must form an essential part of any modern
defense. The whole-of-society approach is thus an inclusive model of
cooperation and joint preparedness that aims to bring all relevant
actors together into a comprehensive system of deterrence. It involves
an effort to diversify and devolve responsibilities for security
production to market- and societal-based actors, while maintaining a
strong coordinating role for the state.

In such a near future, my fellow experts would no longer talk of
"democratic erosion." We would be spiraling downward into a time of
democratic despair, recalling Daniel Patrick Moynihan's grim observation
from the 1970s that liberal democracy "is where the world was, not where
it is going." 5 The world pulled out of that downward spiral---but it
took new, more purposeful American leadership. [The planet was not so
lucky in the 1930s, when the [**global implosion of democracy** led
to]{.mark} a **[catastrophic world war]{.mark}**, between a rising axis
of emboldened dictatorships and a shaken and economically depressed
collection of selfdoubting democracies]{.underline}. [These are the
stakes]{.underline}. [Expanding [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}---with
its liberal norms and constitutional commitments---[[is a **crucial
foundation** for **world peace and security**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Knock that away, and our most basic hopes and assumptions will be
imperiled]{.underline}. The problem is not just that the ground is
slipping. It is that [we are **perched on a global
precipice**]{.underline}. That ledge has been gradually giving way for a
decade. [If the **[erosion]{.mark}** continues, we
**[may]{.mark}**]{.underline} well [[reach a **tipping point** where
**democracy goes bankrupt**]{.mark} suddenly---[plunging the world
into]{.mark} **depths of oppression** and **[aggression]{.mark}** that
we have **[not seen since]{.mark}**]{.underline} the end of **[[World
War II]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As a political scientist, I know that our
theories and tools are not nearly good enough to tell us just how close
we are getting to that point---until it happens.

**[A. [Types of Cyber]{.mark} Threat [Information]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Chismon and Ruks (2015) assembled a useful taxonomy of cyber information
categories based on the kind of decisions the information informs. A
modified version of their taxonomy is shown in Table I. As detailed in
Table I, [[different categories]{.mark} of information[, from
**technical to strategic**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [are intended for
**different consumers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [However, information
across]{.underline} the [four levels]{.underline}---**[technical,
tactical, operational, and strategic]{.underline}**---[is]{.underline}
**[interrelated]{.underline}**. [For example, technical and tactical
information can be combined to generate operational cyber threat
information to improve organisational understanding of an impending
attacker's methods and capabilities]{.underline} (Chismon & Ruks, 2015).
[Similarly, post-incident analysis of technical cyber threat information
often provides the foundation for the implementation of a tactical level
decision. [A]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[holistic
assessment]{.underline}**]{.mark} of technical, tactical, and
operational inputs [[drives the output of strategic cyber threat
information]{.underline}]{.mark}. Despite these complex relationships,
this taxonomy provides a useful way to think about cyber threat
information and is indicative of why technical data-sharing should not
be the sole focus of information sharing programmes. Smaller or [less
mature organisations are unlikely to find much utility in technical or
tactical information sharing, while even]{.underline} [larger
organisations may miss out on key operational or strategic information
insights if they focus exclusively on the technical information. For
this reason, the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA),]{.underline} which
includes established cyber security vendors and related enterprises,
[shares a total of **ten types of actionable cyber threat
information**]{.underline} [across]{.underline} these **[four
categories]{.underline}**, as recalled by the authors and detailed in
Table II.

Understanding the value of these various forms of cyber threat
information requires taking a more mature and nuanced view than the
simplistic assumption that more information sharing means better
security. [This [expanded]{.mark} conceptual [framework for cyber threat
information sharing reflects]{.mark} the [diversity of
information]{.mark} that industry leaders already know must be shared to
strengthen defences]{.underline}. [Each type informs a different aspect
of cyber security and has a different value in different
situations.]{.underline} [[Broad adoption of this]{.underline}]{.mark}
(still high-level) [extension]{.underline} to the framework provided by
Chismon and Ruks (2015) [[would enable cyber security practitioners to
develop]{.underline} **[more nuanced and useful policies for information
sharing.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

**[B. Relevance and Comparative Advantage in I]{.underline}**nformation
**[S]{.underline}**haring

[In other disciplines, from finance to health to politics to sports,
organisations do not produce and consume the same information
equally]{.underline}. Instead, [wide variation occurs based on relevance
to business]{.underline} [models]{.underline}, missions, and perceived
benefits. [Cyber security practitioners and policymakers should expect
cyber threat information sharing to behave similarly. Different
organisations should produce and consume different types of information
based on two principles]{.underline}: **[relevance]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[comparative advantage]{.underline}**. [These two
concepts should drive who should be sharing what information with whom,
in what detail, and at what periodicity.]{.underline}

1\) Relevance of Information

[Companies, non-profit organisations, and government agencies all have
goals or missions and employ specific business models to achieve those
goals. Information sharing should relate directly to an organisation's
goals and]{.underline} business [model. Thus, a cyber security vendor
should share technical cyber threat information at **speed and at scale
continuously**]{.underline} [because it is directly relevant to
their]{.underline} business [model]{.underline}.
**[Conversely]{.underline}**, [a medium-sized manufacturer primarily
needs strategic and operational level cyber threat
information]{.underline}--- [strategic warnings, best practices, and
tactical warnings (e.g., if a government learns that the business or its
industry is being targeted]{.underline})---[all of which need only to be
updated when a change has occurred]{.underline}. Technical cyber threat
information provided at scale to this business would simply not be
useful.

2\) Comparative Advantage of Information Sharing

Even if some organisations can produce certain information types, others
might be more efficient at that work. For example, although governments
can use their intelligence and law enforcement capabilities to collect,
process, and produce technical cyber threat information, they do not
have a comparative advantage in that information type. Private sector
companies can perform that function just as efficiently. However,
[[**governments** have a comparative advantage in]{.underline}]{.mark}
other [[categories, such as attribution]{.underline}]{.mark} of cyber
attacks, [[strategic warnings, and tactical warnings]{.mark}, which
benefit from nation-state-level intelligence capabilities and
authorities]{.underline}. As in other activities, the principle of
comparative advantage should determine which organisations should be
collecting, processing, sharing, and consuming different types of
information.

**[C. Technical, Economic, Legal and Cultural Barriers]{.underline}**

[At first glance, the [barriers]{.mark} [inhibiting information
sharing]{.mark} seem quite varied. However, a closer review shows they
[fall into **four categories**]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [technical,
economic, legal, and cultural]{.underline}]{.mark}. While their specific
manifestations and relative significance will vary across sharing
contexts, [these barriers can combine in various ways to create a
formidable obstacle to sharing.]{.underline}

[Technical barriers prevent information from moving rapidly at
scale]{.underline} or [in]{.underline} easily [consumable
formats.]{.underline} [For example, inconsistent definitions and
terminology and difficulty in achieving interoperability and
automation]{.underline} remain significant obstacles (Zibak & Simpson,
2019). [In turn, these barriers often inhibit the usability]{.underline}
or reliability [of shared information]{.underline} (ENISA, 2017).

[Economic barriers stem from the inability to identify a clear return on
investment from sharing]{.underline} activities. Organisations
'participate in sharing networks when their return is more than the cost
to participate' (Vázquez et al., 2012: p. 432). [This problem can be
compounded by **first-mover disadvantage**]{.underline}, [given that
'establishing threat intelligence sharing infrastructure is
expensive]{.underline} ... \[while\] in the long run, intelligence
sharing could help bring down the overall security cost' (Zibak &
Simpson, 2019: p. 7). Absent a clear and immediate prospect of a return
on investment, proponents often have difficulty making the business case
to establish, invest in or sustain sharing activities. [Legal barriers
come from uncertainty about what information can be shared under what
circumstances or unanswered questions about liability, fines, or
prosecution]{.underline}. These uncertainties deter organisations from
sharing. Privacy laws can hinder sharing by inadvertently classifying
certain cyber threat information as private and thereby limiting how it
can be used or distributed (Panda Security, 2018). These legal concerns
require sharing organisations to undertake extensive consideration of
their potential implications (Borden et al., 2018; Albakri et al.,
2019).

Finally, [cultural barriers can also impede sharing]{.underline} (Luiijf
& Kernkamp, 2015). [For cyber security companies, it can be hard to
overcome the idea that retaining unique data yields a competitive
advantage]{.underline}. For other organisations, it can be hard to
overcome sentiments such as 'no one would target me', 'cyber security is
too complex for executives and non-technical employees to understand',
or 'falling victim to hackers is inevitable, so why bother?' [For
governments, long-standing views about the appropriate respective
roles]{.underline} of the public and private sectors [get in the way of
cooperation and sharing.]{.underline}

[[The **good news** is]{.mark} that, over the last twenty years,
[practitioners have developed ways to **overcome these
barriers.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [The bad news is that [none of these
methods is]{.mark}]{.underline} frictionless or
cost-[[free]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, adopting technical
standards for information sharing may require organisations to adjust
business processes or infrastructure; high initial costs may need to be
met with loans that are paid back by future sharing participants; legal
consultations may be needed to shape sharing rules; and reluctant
executives may need the benefits of information sharing to be explained
in bottom-line terms.

[Across the board, [information sharing requires organisations to expend
resources]{.mark},]{.underline} either money or time. These costs can
decrease but do not disappear. [[Yet, to be worthwhile, information
sharing needs to be **sustained** and organisations have to pay
a]{.mark} long-term, regular [cost for engaging in information sharing
activities]{.mark}. This requirement, in turn, means that information
sharing requires incentives to achieve the scope, scale, and speed
required for effective cyber defence]{.underline}. Such incentives can
range from the individual (avoiding the costs of a cyber incident) to
the public (government grants) to the avoidance of sticks (fines or
penalties for not engaging in appropriate sharing). Regardless,
information sharing laws, policies, programmes, and structures should
assume that information sharing is resource-heavy and requires sustained
investment to occur.

**[D. Trust as a Necessary Component of Information
Sharing]{.underline}**

Experience from previous initiatives and programmes demonstrates that
information sharing only occurs when the providers and recipients have a
degree of trust. As noted by Wagner et al. (2018), trust 'plays a
critical role in sharing' (p. 5). The European Network Information
Agency (ENISA) observes that in situations where trust between members
of the community is diminishing or non-existent the value of information
shared is undermined (ENISA, 2013). [[For information sharing to work,
it is necessary to 'foster confidence]{.mark} for stakeholders that the
provided information will be acted upon as intended']{.underline}
(Wagner et al., 2018: p. 5). [Information providers have to understand
who will receive their information, what they will do with it, and what
level of information sharing-related risk to expect, while information
recipients want to know where the information came from and its
reliability.]{.underline}

[[To reach this level of confidence, information sharing]{.mark}
organisations [should]{.mark} 'provide control mechanisms to **[specify
what information is shared, how much of it and with
whom']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sauerwein et al., 2017: p. 845). According
to ENISA (2012, cited by Vázquez et al., 2012: p. 433), [the use of
intentionally carefully designed trust-building mechanisms, such
as]{.underline} 'the policies, [membership rules, requirement for
security clearance and interaction type' can be beneficial]{.underline}
in the context of information sharing [and will support the creation of
trust.]{.underline}

[[Absent trust, information sharing will **not occur no matter what
structures and incentives are put in place.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Trust
does not require that the participants all like each other, nor does it
mean they share everything. Trust means that participants have a
reasonable belief that all other participants will adhere to the agreed
rules.

**[4. IMPLICATIONS OF INFORMATION SHARING IMPERATIVES]{.underline}**

[The new information sharing presumptions]{.underline} proposed [in this
chapter]{.underline}---[careful consideration of information
type]{.underline} and relevance, comparative advantage in [information
production, how to overcome existing]{.underline} context-specific
[barriers, and how to create and maintain trust---make the cyber threat
information sharing landscape far more complex than most people
envision. Yet, this very complexity provides an opportunity for
simplification]{.underline}: [**[rather than everyone trying to share
everything all the time,]{.underline}** [organisations can concentrate
on the information types most relevant to them]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Information sharing architectures, policies, and systems should assist
organisations in focusing their information sharing activities. Although
identifying all the implications is beyond the scope of this chapter,
some more prominent ones are worthy of mention.

Few organisations will share every type of cyber threat information.
Most organisations should focus on the types of information most
relevant to their business model. For example, under this paradigm, only
organisations with strong technical capabilities would share technical
cyber threat information: cyber security providers, telecommunications
companies, Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Managed Security Service
Providers (MSSPs), and large, multinational companies in critical
industries. Government agencies would focus less on producing
stand-alone technical indicators of compromise (IOCs), which industry
has in abundance, and more on combining that information with strategic
and tactical warning about specific threats, since their comparative
advantage lies in their intelligence and law enforcement capabilities.
Most citizens, businesses and organisations would primarily consume
information about best practices and defensive measures.

[[The focus of information sharing programmes **should
change**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since [most [organisations do not]{.mark}
need to produce or consume [**technical** cyber threat
information]{.mark}, government cyber security initiatives should
reflect this.]{.underline} These programmes should instead encourage
most organisations to hire a cyber security vendor or MSSP. Those
service providers would consume the technical, contextual,
vulnerability, and exploitation information and use it to make security
adjustments such as updating blacklists or prioritising patches. Most
organisations would primarily consume updates to best practice and
strategic or tactical warnings. This change would make information
sharing programmes more relevant and cost-effective.

Information sharing programmes need to build trust. Since trust is a key
component for effective information sharing, programs, structures, and
architectures need to build trust over time. Policies and structures
should include operational processes designed to enhance confidence and
trust when personal rapport among stakeholders may be lacking,
particularly when programs are starting (see Sauerwein et al., 2017;
Sillaber et al., 2016; Vázquez et al., 2012; Wagner et al., 2019). For
example, CTA's information sharing rules specify the nature and scope of
the sharing commitment, how members should handle shared information,
and what enforcement mechanisms and penalties will be applied for
violating those rules. Such clarity and consistency help new members
trust that other members will treat their information properly.

Information sharing products can incorporate more than one information
type. Since the different information types are interdependent, any
given sharing product can contain more than one type. For example, CTA
members share technical indicators and tactical context (and
occasionally attribution) through the same automated system and standard
format (Cyber Threat Alliance, 2020). A more rigorous conceptual
framework for information sharing does not require a rigid division
among the information types from a software or process flow perspective.

Reducing the number of organisations expected to share technical
information would make achieving speed and scale easier. Abandoning the
idea that all organisations everywhere should engage in technical cyber
threat information sharing makes overcoming the barriers to technical
sharing easier. Under this assumption, the number of organisations with
the combination of willingness, relevance, and capability to engage in
technical cyber threat sharing decreases to a large but manageable
number (Aspen Cybersecurity Group, 2018). At this size, having most of
these organisations participating in formal information sharing groups
becomes a reasonable goal.

The information sharing burden would decrease while the value would go
up, increasing the likelihood that organisations voluntarily participate
in such activities. By focusing sharing activities on the most relevant
information types, the time and monetary investment for most
organisations would decrease. At the same time, the connection between
shared information and the organisation's mission or business model
would become clearer, thereby increasing its value and making that value
easier to assess. The decreased burden and increased value would expand
the number of organisations that participate in sharing activities.

Additional standard formats for non-technical information types would
emerge, along with systems to share those formats with increasing
degrees of automation. On the technical side, several standard formats
now facilitate automated information sharing, such as the STIX (MITRE
Corporation, 2012) and MITRE's Adversarial Tactics, Techniques and
Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) frameworks (MITRE Corporation, 2020). More
rigorously dividing cyber threat information into different types would
encourage other formats to emerge and organisations to adopt them.
Standard formats make consumption of information easier for the
recipient. Increased automation would increase speed and scale, making
sharing more effective.

Effective cyber threat information sharing requires planning, long-term
investment, and sustained commitment. For example, technical cyber
threat information sharing is not merely a matter of adopting a
technical standard and installing software. It takes engineering and
analytic time on an ongoing basis as well as maintenance of the
technology and processes. Similarly, consuming cyber security best
practices is not a one-time endeavour; organisations must incorporate
regular review and implementation into their business processes. Absent
a long-term commitment from organisational leadership, sharing usually
withers after an initial burst of enthusiasm. Cyber security should take
on the same status as other business enablers, such as accounting, legal
affairs, and communications; like these areas, cyber security should be
a function that all organisations budget for and sustain over the
long-term.

5\. CONCLUSION

[Cyber threat information sharing has bedevilled the cyber security
community for at least two decades. Faulty assumptions have prevented
this fundamentally sound concept from achieving its
potential]{.underline}. But while information sharing is a tough
problem, it is not an insoluble one. [[If the cyber security community
adopts different underlying assumptions for information
sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} then the volume, quality, and utility of
the [[exchanged information can increase. In turn, more
effective]{.mark}, relevant information [sharing will enable defenders
to **better understand and anticipate adversaries**]{.mark}, [develop
mechanisms to **disrupt adversary activities**]{.mark}]{.underline} more
strategically, [[and raise the level of cyber security **across the
digital ecosystem**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under these circumstances,
[cyber threat [information sharing can finally live up to its promise to
enable **better cyber security for everyone.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[For [NATO]{.mark},]{.underline}** [updating programmes to reflect
these revised information sharing assumptions [would require]{.mark}
**[significant changes]{.mark} to current operations**]{.underline}.
First, [overcoming the technical, economic, legal, and cultural barriers
to sharing relevant, actionable information across member countries and
economic sectors [will require **sustained attention, prioritisation,
and funding from NATO's**]{.mark} **senior
leadership**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Absent such attention]{.mark}, the
[barriers will likely prove **insurmountable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Second, [[NATO should build on its existing]{.mark} MISP [use to create
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more comprehensive system of information
sharing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that]{.underline} br**[oadens the types
of information shared]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[widens the
number of recipients]{.underline}**. [Third, [NATO
should]{.mark}]{.underline} consider how to [[better leverage industry
for technical information, while enriching that information with
**government-derived information about context, attribution, and
intent.**]{.underline} [If NATO **shifted** its
approach]{.underline}]{.mark} [to information sharing [as
suggested]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[the Alliance would have the
opportunity to assume a leadership position]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in
this area]{.underline}**. [[If not, NATO will **continue to struggle to
make information sharing live up to its promise.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The concept of cyber peace brings a much-needed, innovative perspective
to discussions of]{.underline} the governance of
[cyberspace]{.underline}. The ambiguity, conflicting terminology, and
lack of transparency with respect to activities by state and nonstate
actors have characterized efforts to conceptualize and analyze this new
area of human endeavor at least since John Perry Barlow's 1996
Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace. Barlow's (1996)
proclamation that claimed cyberspace as a home for the "civilization of
the Mind" and a "global social space" that must be kept free of
governments, state sovereignty, and legal constructs -- in effect,
exempt from any type of governance -- marked early on in the life of
online activities the challenges and tensions that remain today for the
global collective action problem of cyberspace governance. Thus, the
distinctive perspective of cyber peace has the potential to set our
analytical sights anew and to provide a framework for moving ahead with
the normative projects connected to the aspects of cyberspace
governance, including the ongoing elucidation of binding rules of
international and domestic law that are applicable to cyberspace
activities of state and nonstate actors.

Building on previous chapters that treat the concept of cyber peace in
depth, the following definition focuses on four specific elements:

[[Cyber peace is \[...\] **not** \[...\] **the absence of
conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark} \[...\]. [[Rather it is the construction
of]{.mark} a network of multilevel [regimes that promote global]{.mark},
just and **[sustainable cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by
clarifying the rules of the road for companies and countries alike to
help reduce the threats of cyber conflict, crime and espionage to levels
comparable to other business and national security risks. [To achieve
this goal, a **new approach to cybersecurity is
needed**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that seeks out best
practices]{.underline} from the public and private sectors to build
robust, secure systems and couches cybersecurity within the larger
debate on internet governance (Shackelford, 2014, pp. xxv--xxvi).

[[The]{.mark} four elements emphasized]{.underline} in the above
definition [[describe the **fundamental connection**]{.underline}
[between]{.underline}]{.mark} the goals of **[[cyber peace and
info]{.mark}rmation [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}** [(IS),]{.underline}
the subject of this chapter (Johnson et al., 2016, p. iii).1
[Clarification of "rules of the road,"]{.underline} whether these are
binding or voluntary[; threat reduction, risk assessment, and best
practices]{.underline} for carrying out these three tasks
[are]{.underline} **[precisely]{.underline}** [the substantive
contribution [that]{.mark} **IS makes to the cybersecurity
postures**]{.underline} and strategies of stakeholders participating in
any given IS platform. As detailed herein, [such a platform optimally
defines threshold norms of permissible and nonpermissible online
behavior on the part of all actors, establishing the criteria for
determining whether a]{.underline}n [individual, private organization,
country, group of hackers, or even another autonomously acting computer
has violated a rule]{.underline} (Deljoo et al., 2018, p. 1508).
[It]{.underline} also [**[reduces vulnerability to cyber
threats]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} **[lessening the informational
asymmetries]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that characterize hostile cyber
activities to the advantage of the attacker, [and contributes to
**organizational risk assessment**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by integrating
the information shared]{.underline}]{.mark} by other participants in the
IS community [[into]{.underline} **[heightened "cyber situational
awareness]{.underline}**]{.mark}" for all sharers. Fourth, [[IS
is]{.mark} readily framed and understood by a multiplicity of
actors]{.underline} at the domestic level -- private, governmental, and
individual [-- as a best practice and, at the **international level, as
[a confidence-building measure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (CBM[) [for
building trust]{.mark}]{.underline} among state and nonstate actors.2
These two characterizations of IS in the domestic and international
jurisdictional arenas, respectively, are evidenced by the inclusion of
IS modalities in many instances of national law and policy, as well as
tens of multilateral and bilateral instruments for governing cyberspace
at the international level (Housen-Couriel, 2017, pp. 46--84). Five
examples of the latter are the 2015 Shanghai Cooperation Organization's
International Code of Conduct for Information Security, the UN GGE
Report of July 2015, the OSCE's Confidence-Building Measures for
Cyberspace of 2016, the EU's Network and Information Security Directive
that entered into force in August 2016; and the 2018 Paris Call for
Trust and Security in Cyberspace.

[[When IS implemented]{.mark} as a]{.underline} voluntary or recommended
[best practice or CBM in the context of these]{.underline} regulatory
[arrangements]{.underline} -- rather than as a mandated regulatory
requirement -- [[it has the advantage of **bypassing the legal
challenges**]{.mark} of achieving **formal and substantive
multistakeholder agreement** on cyber norms]{.underline}. The
difficulties of such normative barriers are often observed as
characteristic of the contemporary cyber lay of the land. Either [as
a]{.underline} best practice (at the domestic level) or a [CBM at the
international level, IS has the advantage of bypassing the present
challenges of achieving formal and substantive multistakeholder
agreement on cyber norms that are inherent elements of national and
multilateral legal regimes for the governance of cyberspace]{.underline}
(Macak, 2016; Ruhl et al., 2020).

[[We propose]{.underline}]{.mark} in this chapter [that, as [IS]{.mark}
platforms [provide increasingly relevant, timely, and actionable data on
vulnerabilities,]{.mark} including zero-day vulnerabilities]{.underline}
(Ablon & Bogart, 2017); [adversaries' tactics, techniques, and
procedures; malware tool configurations; and [other tactical and
strategic]{.mark} threat indicators, [stakeholders will become **more
incentivized** to increasingly]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[trust IS
platforms]{.underline}** [and to utilize them for both **real-time
response to hostile cyber activities**]{.underline} [and for building
**longterm cybersecurity strategies**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Technological advances are easing this process, as platforms adopt new
techniques for the automation of alerts and communications among
sharers]{.underline} (Wagner et al., 2019). Thus, [in instances when
sharing communities are]{.underline} substantively and technologically
[optimized]{.underline} for cybersecurity, [participants benefit from
expertise and insights which may otherwise be unavailable to
them]{.underline} with respect to developing threat vectors, mitigation
of specific cyber risks, and real-time coordinated responses to hostile
cyber events.

#### The US is key \-\-- Our intelligence is critical and sharing it guarantees other countries model 

**[Arts 18]{.underline}** \-\-- Sophie Arts, master\'s degree in
American studies with a concentration in U.S. foreign policy and
political communication from Humboldt University in Berlin, "Offense as
the New Defense: New Life for NATO's Cyber Policy", German Marshall
Fund, 2018 \| No. 039,
https://www.gmfus.org/sites/default/files/Offense%2520-%2520Arts.pdf

Related to this challenge, [NATO's constraints on information
sharing]{.underline} could **[hurt strategic
decisionmaking]{.underline}** processes and cyber operations. While most
experts acknowledge that intelligence capabilities within NATO are
significant, these remain isolated and well-guarded by national
intelligence communities.31 More [[advanced information sharing,]{.mark}
among allies]{.underline} and with other partners such as the EU, **[[is
critical for situational awareness and NATO's
preparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Yet]{.underline}, due mostly to a
lack of trust between allies, [this process is far from being at an
optimal level]{.underline}.32

[[When it comes to intelligence sharing,]{.mark} some allies fear that
infiltration and attacks against countries with lower resilience
could]{.underline} potentially [compromise information shared by other
member states]{.underline}. [[Pushback against greater transparency is
**especially strong on the part of the United States**]{.underline},
[which owns a **large share of NATO's intelligence
capabilities**]{.underline}, [making it a **critical player
in**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[alliance [intelligence
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}** from a tactical as well as strategic
perspective.33 [Due to the country's **outsized role in this
field**]{.underline}, [[NATO's intelligence adaptation is **largely
dependent on U.S. inclinations to share capabilities**]{.mark} **and
information [with other allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}34
Although efforts to protect intelligence by minimizing sharing may be
justified, [elevating the role of the United States in NATO's cyber
policy **without increasing transparency**]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} potentially **[limit tactical
effectiveness]{.underline}**.

#### Information sharing and management are critical to NATO cyber resilience and attribution capabilities \-\-- countries will follow-on the US model

**[Brown 19]{.underline}** \-\-- Sarah Brown et al, Senior Scientist at
the NATO Communications and Information (NCI) Agency where she works on
cyber security capability development for NATO, with a particular
interest in cyber threat intelligence, "Towards Mature Federated Cyber
Incident Management and Information Sharing Capabilities in NATO and
NATO Nations", MILCOM 2019 - 2019 IEEE Military Communications
Conference (MILCOM), https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9020814

For the past decade, [cyber security teams around the world have
recognized the growing importance of sharing cyber security information.
[Data regarding]{.mark} recently **discovered
[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, cyber
**[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} even
cyber **[[incident]{.mark} information]{.underline}** [[has been
recognized as **vital for cyber security**]{.underline}]{.mark} teams
[[to **stay resilient**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the face of the
ever-changing threat landscape.

Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline})
**[need to share information with each other]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} to [work collaboratively in order [to
investigate]{.mark} potential [cyber security
incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[Particularly in the course of joint
missions]{.underline}**, [it is recognized as a key requirement to allow
mission commanders to build situational awareness and to make more
informed decisions in response to threats or
vulnerabilities.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Federated Mission Network ([FMN) framework aims to
enable the rapid deployment of mission networks by **federating**
NATO]{.underline}, NATO Nations, and Mission Partner capabilities.
Federated [cyber information sharing and incident
management]{.underline} are included as key cyber security requirements.

[The focus of this paper is to discuss]{.underline} incident management
and information sharing challenges, and to highlight [the value added by
the]{.underline} Cyber Information and Incident Coordination System
([CIICS]{.underline}) [system to support these
capabilities.]{.underline}

SECTION II.Federated Cyber Incident Management

[Cyber incident management (IM) can be defined as the ability to plan
and control activities that ensure detected attacks and faults are
addressed. Incidents need to be managed from start to finish to ensure
that systems and services can be returned to a normal state, any
undesired effects are addressed, and future reoccurrences are prevented.
The results from these activities is a key information source for
improving effectiveness and efficiency of cybersecurity]{.underline}.

[[Cyber information sharing]{.mark} (IS) refers [to sharing of reference
information about systems]{.mark}, networks, and interdependencies, [as
well as threat intelligence]{.mark} to include indicators of attacks as
they progress, to support partners in their own defence
activities.]{.underline}

[[In a **federated mission context**]{.underline}, [establishing these
capabilities supports **collective defence**]{.underline}, [which is
**essential** in support of **mission objectives**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[However, in a federated design these capabilities require **very high
levels of interoperability**]{.underline} [to support quality
interaction between participants. In a federated environment closely
connected networks of teams operate as a decentralized, multi-team
system]{.underline}.

[It may be difficult to execute relatively simple tasks such as checking
a range of systems for signs of an intrusion. While each federation
participant organizes collaboration between its own team members, [the
success of the federated cyber]{.mark}]{.underline} IM function
[**[hinges]{.underline}** [on the interaction between component
teams]{.underline}]{.mark} (across the different FMN participants)
[[that make up the capability.]{.underline}]{.mark}

SECTION III.Federated Cyber IM Best Practices

Previous NCI Agency work \[1\] on best practices for achieving
successful IM&IS in a multi-team system provided recommendations that
apply across the Doctrine, Organization, Training, Material, Leadership,
Personnel, Facility, and Interoperability (DOTMLPFI) spectrum.

Two key recommendations address roles and responsibilities and technical
interoperability.

[Defined roles and responsibilities, as well as communication channels,
are required for the federated cyber IM&IS capability to achieve
interoperability]{.underline} between teams. Ideally, all individuals
with a role in the IM capability will have the details of all the other
individuals, including contact information, role, and position in the
overall hierarchy.

[Technical interoperability is also an essential and inseparable element
in capability development and system implementation for
FMN]{.underline}. Cyber IM&IS systems operating in an FMN environment
may need to transmit data to and receive data from a variety of other
systems, units or forces of any service or Nation, and use the exchanged
data to operate effectively together. [Without it, it is not possible to
work together effectively collaborating in a multi-vendor,
multi-network, multi-service environment]{.underline} \[5\].

SECTION IV.Capability Development with Ciics

[It is this shared challenge (and requirement), among
Nations]{.underline} and [within NATO, for federated cyber IM&IS, that
formed the basis of development of the CIICS project]{.underline} in
2014.

[The CIICS project was initiated by three]{.underline} (3) [Nations:
Canada, The Netherlands, and Romania, as part of the Multinational Cyber
Defence Capability Development]{.underline} (MN CD2) smart defence
program1, in which a group of Nations, supported by the NATO
Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) pooled resources to develop
solutions to common challenges.

[CIICS is a tool to support cyber IM&IS]{.underline}, both within and
beyond organizational boundaries.

[CIICS is built around four (4) key functional]{.underline} requirements
required in NATO and by the MN CD2 CIICS Nations.

**[A. Federated Design]{.underline}**

[CIICS is designed with a federated architecture to support multi-team
collaboration]{.underline}, such as in an FMN scenario, as illustrated
in Fig. 1. CIICS nodes are able to exchange data with other CIICS nodes
by directly establishing a communication channel to each other
(peer-to-peer mode). A dedicated public key infrastructure (PKI) allows
strong certificate-based authentication between CIICS nodes. CIICS nodes
manage the data and provide a web application to front-end to users.

**[B. Ability to Work Collaboratively]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
Cyber [Securiy Incidents and]{.underline} to Share Key [Cyber
Information]{.underline}

From an information sharing perspective, [Nations can directly feed
threat intelligence, email alerts, and other relevant cyber defence
information directly into their CIICS instance. This information will be
stored in a knowledge base and is automatically replicated to all other
Nation\'s CIICS nodes]{.underline}. The reference library is indexed
with Elastic Search to enable efficient searching of large amounts of
data.

[From an IM perspective, CIICS contains a ticketing system designed
specifically to track cyber defence incidents]{.underline}. Tickets can
be handled locally on the CIICS node, or can be shared with one or more
participants (e.g., in a federated mission environment), facilitating
both local cyber incident handling, and joint coordination of incidents
as necessary.

**[C. High Degree of Customization]{.underline}**

[CIICS is highly customizable. It support custom configuration of
workflows, permissions, notifications, presentation language, structure
and fields]{.underline}. Incident information is stored in an incident
ticketing [system component with many "facet" templates which can be
added to support different incident types, as required]{.underline}.
General knowledge (in human or machine readable formats)can be stored in
a wiki-based knowledge repository, with configurable Communities of
Interest with varying privacy / sharing levels.

**[D. Standards-Based Design]{.underline}**

[CIICS is standards-based, with the ability to import and export data in
standard formats as well as enabling other systems to exchange data with
CIICS nodes]{.underline} via its API.

SECTION V.**[[The Incentive to Share]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[CIICS was designed with a number of target user groups in
mind]{.mark}. These include]{.underline} National military Computer
Emergency Response Teams ([CERTs]{.underline}), other [National defence
organizations]{.underline}, the [NATO]{.underline} [Computer Incident
Response Capability Technical Center (NCIRC TC), and FMN
teams.]{.underline}

[As with all organizations with a defence or security focus, [the need
to know tends to dominate]{.mark}. That is, information is limited to
only those who are believed to have good]{.underline} business [reasons
to access the information.]{.underline} Sharing sensitive security
outside of the organization is considered not worth the risk.

[**[Usually]{.underline}**, [sharing will only start to happen when an
organization is not able to solve an incident]{.underline}]{.mark} [or
needs extra information to be able to solve]{.underline} it. [A tipping
point it reached when the need to share exceeds the need to know. That
is when incident sharing becomes clear and precise, and supplied and /
or requested information will be handled and addressed
properly.]{.underline}

This need to share will also occur when an infrastructure or application
is shared, meaning there is a chance of being impacted by the same
incident.

[[In most]{.underline}]{.mark} other
[[circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark} common [[needs for incident
information will be unclear, and requesting]{.mark} or supplying
actionable [information is **really a challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[This]{.underline}]{.mark} [will either [result in]{.mark} the sharing
of massive amounts of incident information, since we are not sure what
to share, so might as well share everything, or **[very risk-averse
sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of only **very few
pieces**]{.underline} [which we feel do not expose our own systems or
vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}[. As a result [this shared
information **will be not directly actionable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[by the receiving party]{.underline}** [thus]{.underline} **[hard to
address and filter]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[So trust and sharing incident information only really becomes viable
when there is a common goal that is collectively well understood and
articulated.]{.underline}

SECTION VI.Federated Incident Management and Information Sharing in
Action

[Following its successful development]{.underline} and release, [the
CIICS sponsoring nations deployed a federation between themselves and
the NCIRC]{.underline} TC which operates across the Internet at
UNCLASSIFIED. A number of other nations have since joined this
federation, and a community continues to [grow. It has been interfaced
to the open source Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP) to draw
in various pieces of structured cyber threat information which can then
be linked to incidents within CIICS, and allows the users to explore
overall links]{.underline} (for example, if certain indicators of
compromise (IOCs) have been seen associated with multiple incidents,
these incidents may infact also be linked).

As described above, **[however]{.underline}**, [in
peacetime]{.underline}, **[and with the limitation of the
classification]{.underline}**, [only]{.underline} **[very limited
information sharing is viable through this system.]{.underline}** The
federation nations and NCIRC TC continue to work together to define the
information sharing parameters for such a system.

In the meantime, the [NATO]{.underline} Headquarters Consultation,
Command and Control Staff (NHQC3S) [recognize the overwhelming
requirement for cyber information sharing]{.underline} platforms,
[and]{.underline} indeed [the requirement for]{.underline} potentially
**[more classified information sharing]{.underline}**, as they are in
the process of implementing a MISP for access by NATO Nations and
partners via BICES. Similarly, they are working on the development of
the precise information exchange requirements for such circumstances.

On the domestic level, the Netherlands and Romania have found great use
in the CIICS system for cyber information sharing and incident handling
between government departments.

In the Netherlands, a national UNCLASSIFIED CIICS federation allows the
various military domains to share relevant (nationally sensitive) cyber
incidents, as they recognize the commonality between their different
network infrastructures, and the potential benefits from this
collaboration. More sensitive incidents can be escalated up to, and be
handled on, their highly classified CIICS federation, while they can
transfer nonsensitive elements back to the international CIICS as deemed
appropriate. More details are provided in Section VII.

Romania\'s National Cyberint Center (CNC) implemented a CIICS federation
between 55 central government agencies, again recognizing that the
institutions have a shared goal to identify and analyze cyber threats.
An interface to the UNCLASSIFIED international CIICS system allows them
to selectively share non-sensitive details, as described in more detail
in Section VIII.

To further explore use cases on classified systems, the sponsoring
nations also provided the CIICS system for trial in a number of NATO
exercises, which are discussed in Section IX.

SECTION VII.NLD National Experience

In The Netherlands Ministry of Defence (NL MOD) each military branch as
well as the Military police (Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), Royal
Netherlands Navy (RNLN), Royal Netherlands Military Police (RNLMP),
Royal Netherlands Army (RNLA)) has their own cyber security challenges
within their own specific working area.

While the different forces use different hardware - tanks, airplanes,
ships, armored cars - they do all use a shared communications
infrastructure. Here there is a common interest and an implicit need to
share incident information about that infrastructure as well as the
technical details that can threaten it.

Within the NL MOD, multiple infrastructures are being used, which are
not necessarily interconnected - for example, as a result of different
classifications. But these are built upon the same building blocks,
probably suffering from the same vulnerabilities.

While information that relates to a specific operational command may not
need to be shared to other organizations, there will always be
information that is important to share.

Being interconnected and being able to share incident information when
needed is key here and CIICS is used to meet this requirement. Each
operational command determines from its own authority whether to share
or escalate an incident to the other organizations.

Furthermore, at the national level, NL MOD has identified multiple
requirements for CIICS instances - at the "National Restricted" level,
at the "National Secret" level, and also requirements to pass across the
unclassified international federation, as well as potential classified
(mission) federations. In trying to balance this plethora of business
requirements, NL MOD has come up with an interesting solution, as
illustrated in Fig. 2.

From this perspective all operational commands will run their own
unclassified CIICS instances "National Restricted area" in Fig. 2), and
these will be federated to one another.

To be able to handle and share classified incident information a
federated national classified CIICS environment is also set up "National
Secret area" in Fig. 2). This classified

CIICS system will be able to receive information from NATO partners and
the unclassified CIICS system through data-diodes. This highly
classified CIICS-system-high environment will contain the most relevant
and complete actionable and historical incident information for each
operational command and for the NL MOD CERT in an incident escalation
role.

The NL MOD CERT\'s CIICS systems play an additional role in that they
have additional interconnections with other CIICS federations
(illustrated in Fig. 2 by the diodes), so that they can get or share
incident information with other organizations, (e.g., governmental or
peers). Sharing declassified incident information from the higher
classifications downwards is done via air-gapped processes, following
policies.

SECTION VIII.ROU National Experience

In Romania, following its designation as a national authority in the
field of cyber intelligence, the Romanian Intelligence Service, through
a specific unit, the National Cyberint Center (CNC), has endeavored to
identify, prevent and counter the vulnerabilities, risks and threats to
Romania\'s cyber security.

The team from Cyberint Center\'s objective is to collect, identify and
understand cyber events from Cyber Infrastructures of National Interest
(CII). Hence in2015, CNC implemented a project to build a National
security system for the protection of Communications and Information
Systems (CIS) critical infrastructures against cyber security threats.
The project was implemented across 55 public infrastructures used by 55
institutions across Romania, bringing them together for a shared goal to
identify and analyze cyber threats.

CIICS was implemented in a federated architecture, supporting joint
incident handling, coordination and collaboration between the CNC
organization and any of the 55 CIIs. When there is a common interest,
CNC has the ability to share related aspects of cyber incidents with all
organizations, helping them to have a proactive defence against specific
threats.

The federated network between all the CIIs is a dedicated and isolated
network between the 55 institutions and associated CIICS instances,
together with a MISP instance, which is the main CNC tool used for
sharing of indicators of compromise (see Fig. 3).

As with the Dutch, the Romanians have implemented a slightly bespoke
CIICS deployment to best suit their national requirements. In this case,
all instances are hosted and managed by the CNC, as a national authority
for cyber defence. The federated system model allows the institutions to
manage local incidents on their own system, and only share information
that they believe might be of interest to other parties. The CNC acts as
an escalation / central control hub to facilitate appropriate
decision-making for sharing.

CIICS was also used during the last 3 editions of the main Romanian
cyber defence exercise, CyDEx. The ability to conduct federated cyber
defence information sharing as well as cyber incident artefacts, were
the most appreciated aspects from the participating teams.

SECTION IX.Exercising Mission-Based Federated Incident Management and
Information Sharing

The CIICS system has also been provided to NATO for use by National CERT
teams during the Cyber Coalition (CC) Exercise (2014--2018), the Cyber
Focus Area of the Cyber Warrior Interoperability eXercise
(CWIX)(2014--2017), and NATO Response Force (NRF) in Steadfast Cobalt
Exercise (2019). As described previously, a joint mission environment is
the perfect scenario to necessitate joint cyber incident handling and
information sharing.

Lessons learned during these exercises have been valuable to further
refine what is needed by NATO and Nations across all DOTMLPFI aspects
for federated incident management and federated information sharing.

Through use in Cyber Coalition exercises, users demonstrated a far
richer appetite for joint IM&IS than is usually demonstrated during
daily operations on fixed national networks. The tool proved a success
in that teams progressed though the storylines faster than expected due
to the rich collaboration. Lessons were learned in terms of the need for
guidance on what information should, and should not, be shared \[7\].

At CWIX, the Cyber Focus Area is a test-bed by nations for new cyber
capabilities. A federated network is formed, and proof of concepts are
trialled, for example honeynets and honeytokens. A red team is then
allowed to attack the federated blue teams, and they can exercise
protecting themselves - and working together - for mutual defence. The
red team attacks give the blue team participants good reason to share
incident information, and the new capabilities help exercise the CIICS
tool, to make sure it can support all types of cyber information
sharing.

Steadfast Cobalt 2019 provided an opportunity to address a Cyber Defense
(CD) IM&IS shortfall identified during the evaluation of the security
domains NRF2020 and Joint Command and Control Capability (JC2C). NATO
CIS Group (NCISG)Cyber Directorate, in coordination with NCI Agency Test
Directorate, set up a feasibility test for existing CD IM&IS processes
to determine if it meets operational network requirements.

These processes were complimented by a single CIICS instance, managed by
NATO, deployed at the Mission Secret level, as a tool to facilitate the
FMN teams in the absence of other tooling designed for this purpose.
While this isn\'t the ideal implementation for CIICS - which would be
for each mission network partner to have its own locally managed system,
federated to the equivalent systems of the other partners such that
information can be exchanged between them when required - this simple
deployment enabled selective sharing via "visibility groups" and further
helped the community to establish escalation processes, and to further
determine agreements on when and what to share. Indeed, the requirement
to have national ownership and privacy over a nationally-controlled,
federated system, was highlighted by some partners, and this deterred
them from using the system to handle nation-level incidents.

Fourteen (14) National deployed units from 10+ countries in Bucharest
Romania along with several static entities (NCISG, JFC Brunssum, JFC
Naples) tested their processes and ability to coordinate and work
together on cyber security incidents that may affect a joint mission
they are in together \[3\] \[4\].

The CD IM&IS process was assessed as capable for management and
information sharing in future NRF-/FMN-networks and it was recommended
that these requirements be endorsed as operational requirements for
future NRF-rotations \[6\]

At a national and multinational level, cyber defence teams from NATO,
NATO Nations, and Partners increasingly have a requirement to share
cyber defence information and to coordinate on cyber incidents,
particularly when they are engaged as coalition partners (e.g., the FMN
Spiral 3 requirement for Nations to be able to conduct joint incident
coordination and cyber security information sharing in a federated
environment \[2\]).

SECTION X.Conclusion

Therefore, [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and Nations [**[must find
ways]{.underline}** [to work seamlessly as a closely connected network
of]{.underline}]{.mark} decentralized [[teams]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
reflected in the FMN concept.

Collaborative work to date has made significant steps in establishing
joint information sharing requirements, national and joint incident
handling processes and procedures - and the definition of the interfaces
between them, and requirements for the definition of escalation
processes.

Three Nations, NLD, ROU, and CAN have developed a valuable tool in CIICS
to support NATO and Nations in addressing requirements.

[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} and Nations [[must continue to invest in
**maturing existing capabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([e.g., roles
and responsibilities, **what to share,**]{.underline} workflows,
**[interoperable tools and systems, training, etc]{.underline}**.), [to
[achieve mature federated incident coordination and **information
sharing capabilities**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[NATO is also encouraged to use common funding to further the
development of these capabilities, because of the federated aspect to
the capability requirement.]{.underline}

[[International collaboration is of the **utmost
importance**]{.underline} [for]{.underline} **[effective
response]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[mechanisms]{.underline}**. Indeed,
[digital boundaries are not clearly defined and do not correspond to
national frontiers]{.underline}. Moreover, recent publications show that
[[threats]{.mark} such as malware]{.underline} (and botnets, in
particular) [[are no longer]{.mark} an [issue that people should deal
with **individually**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [but are
increasingly a social and **civic responsibility**]{.underline} [that
affects all sectors of the digital society]{.underline} (Anonymous,
2012, ENISA, 2013b).

According to Helmbrecht et al. (2013), [response mechanisms, containing
numerous established policy initiatives, have been in place from the
early days of ICT development. **However**]{.underline}, [the deployment
of [ICT]{.mark} solutions [used]{.mark} by citizens [in]{.mark} their
[day-to-day lives is threatened by cyber attacks, targeting areas such
as online payment]{.mark}, e-[government services]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} in general **[[every critical

Finally, ICT is increasingly used in [vandalism]{.underline},

The European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) is the main
European body aiming at improving the convergence of efforts from the
different Member States by encouraging the exchange of information,
methods and results, and avoiding duplication of work. To this end, one
of ENISA\'s tasks is to support European institutions and Member States
by facilitating a coordinated approach to respond to network and
information security threats.

The NIST supports the coordination of existing Computer Security
Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs), when responding to computer security
incidents, by identifying technical standards, methodologies,
procedures, and processes related to Computer Security Incident
Coordination (CSIC). NIST provides guidance on how multiple CSIRTs
should cooperate while handling computer security incidents, and how
CSIRTs should establish synergies with other organizations within a
broader information sharing community.

4.2. The threat landscape

[The [cyber threat]{.mark} landscape **[evolves
rapidly]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Innovative methods to achieve
malicious objectives are constantly taking shape in cyber space.
[Cyber-criminals and]{.mark}]{.underline} certain [[nation-states are
**aggressively pursuing** ]{.mark}**valuable [data
assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as financial transaction
information, product design blueprints, user credentials to sensitive
systems, and other intellectual property. [[Attackers are armed
with]{.mark} the latest **[zero-day
vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, high-quality toolkits, and
social engineering techniques [to perpetrate advanced targeted attacks.
These threats use several stages and vectors to duck traditional
defenses]{.underline} [and find vulnerable systems and sensitive
data]{.underline} (FireEye, 2013).

[Attacks have changed in form, function, and sophistication]{.underline}
from just a few years ago. [The new generation of threats utilize both
mass-market malware designed to infect multiple systems as well as
sophisticated, zero-day malware to infect targeted systems. They
leverage **multiple attack vectors**]{.underline} cutting across Web,
email, and application-based attacks. [Today\'s attacks are aimed at
getting valuable data assets, sensitive financial information,
intellectual property, authentication credentials]{.underline}, insider
information, [and each attack is often a multi-staged effort to
infiltrate networks, spread, and ultimately exfiltrate the valuable
data]{.underline} (FireEye, 2013).

[Modern [cyber attackers are not]{.mark} only [motivated by economic
reasons, but also]{.mark} their actions are more and more driven by
**impulses of [social and political nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[International groups of associated activists and
hacktivists]{.underline}, such as Anonymous, [are nowadays well known
for attacks on government]{.underline}, religious and corporate websites
(Olson, 2012). In April 2007, [Estonian government networks were
harassed by a denial of service attack]{.underline} by unknown foreign
intruders, following the country\'s spat with Russia over the removal of
a war memorial. [Some government online services were temporarily
disrupted and online banking was halted]{.underline}. The attacks were
more like cyber riots than crippling attacks and provoked outages
lasting several hours or days (Herzog, 2011). In October 2010, Stuxnet,
a complex piece of malware designed to interfere with Siemens Industrial
Control Systems (ICS), was discovered in Iran, Indonesia, and elsewhere,
leading to speculation that it was a government cyber weapon aimed at
the Iranian nuclear program (Farwell and Rohozinski, 2011). On November
24, 2014, data belonging to Sony Pictures Entertainment including
personal information about Sony Pictures employees and their families,
e-mails between employees, information about executive salaries at the
company, copies of unreleased Sony films, and other information were
released by hackers who called themselves the "Guardians of Peace" or
"GOP" (State of California Department of Justice Office of the Attorney
General, 2014). They demanded the cancellation of the planned release of
the film The Interview, a comedy about a plot to assassinate North
Korean leader.

[[In order to develop effective defense strategies, it is necessary to
**understand** the cyber threats]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
methodologies put in place to deploy them. [The components of the
evolving cyber threat landscape are becoming **increasingly
complex**]{.underline}. [A comprehensive analysis of the reported cyber
incidents needs to be performed to characterize the multitude of aspects
a cyber threat involves]{.underline}. Priority lists of cyber threats,
threat agents, attack methods and threat trends are all elements that
need to be taken into consideration. This information is useful for
cyber security experts assessing risks to various systems and developing
cyber security policies for defending valuable information.
Nevertheless, care should always be taken when analyzing such data --
the fact that an event has happened frequently in the past does not
guarantee that it will continue to happen.

[[Given that]{.mark} the [cyber threat]{.mark} landscape [develops very
dynamically, the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[main
ch[allenge]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is to **capture the trends as early
as possible**]{.underline}]{.mark} (cf. ENISA report, Helmbrecht et al.,
2013).

In 2014, for Drive-by-exploits there is a shift from botnets to
malicious URLs as the preferred means to distribute malware, because
URLs are a more difficult target for law enforcement take-downs.
Regarding Code Injection, a notable issue is attacks against popular
content management systems (CMSs). Due to their wide use, popular CMSs
make up a considerable attack surface that has drawn the attention of
cyber criminals. An interesting aspect is the increased use of
peer-to-peer (P2P) botnets -- more difficult to locate and take down.
Also, the use of botnet infrastructures to mine the "virtual currency"
bitcoins is an emerging trend.

After the 2013 Spamhaus attack (Arstechnica, 2013), Domain Name System
(DNS) reflection attacks have gained popularity within the Denial of
Service attacks. Further, there is an increase in rogueware/scareware
reported. One reason for the growth is the expansion of ransomware and
fake antivirus distribution to mobile platforms such as Android. Cyber
espionage attacks reached a dimension that went far beyond expectations
(ENISA, 2013c). Several mass surveillance campaigns run by nation states
have been recently uncovered (see Clarke, 2011 and Hudson, 2014),
generating the indignation of the population. Identity theft led to some
of the most successful attacks by abusing SMS-forwarders to commit
significant financial fraud. These attacks were based on known financial
Trojans (e.g. Zeus, SpyEye, Citadel) that have been implemented on
mobile platforms and attack two-factor authentication. Search Engine
Poisoning has also moved to mobile devices. These developments led to
the conclusion that attackers remain one step ahead; quite often it
suffices to exploit simple and well known weaknesses to cause havoc.

Although [[info]{.mark}rmation [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} might seem
in contrast with the attitude of some nation states performing espionage
on other countries, this should not void information sharing efforts
among organizations (especially those with similar infrastructures, and
thus suffering from similar vulnerabilities or being potentially
similarly attractive to attackers) from these countries on another
layer. The key message of ENISA is to [transfer knowledge from the cyber
security community to the user groups for the purpose of
[strength]{.mark}ening [cyber defense]{.mark}. To this end,
[effective]{.mark} information [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline}, not only
between security professionals, but also between all stakeholders
dealing with critical ICT systems, **[[needs to be
enabled]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

## Aff Extensions / A2s \-\-- Resilience

At an international level, the challenges are compounded even when the
interdependence of cyberspace and a commonality of threats and interests
makes the imperative to cooperate highly salient. [[The]{.mark}
transatlantic [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, broadly construed,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} oftentimes [**[struggled]{.underline}** [to
arrive at]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[consensus around]{.underline}]{.mark}
what constitutes acceptable [behavior]{.underline} and appropriate
responses [in [cyberspace]{.mark}]{.underline}. More **[directly

and signals intelligence worlds, [[creates **significant impediments to
sharing intelligence**]{.underline} [even among close allies that would
enable]{.underline}]{.mark} **[timely and [effective attribution,
defense, and other responses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For offensive cyber
operations in particular, the challenge is most delicate. Allies vary in
terms of the level of maturity of offensive cyber programs (if at all);
perspectives on the application of sovereignty to cyberspace and, by
extension, how other states should approach maneuvering in others'
networks; and potential sources of mistrust about allies' cyber
activities. The latter is evident in debates about how new US cyber
concepts, such as persistent engagement and defend forward, which were
debuted in Cyber Command's 2018 Command Vision and the 2018 Department
of Defense Cyber Strategy, might affect US allies.181 [[Issues]{.mark}

as "gray space" by the US military, and appropriate mechanisms and

### A2: Resilience Now

#### Cyberattacks inevitable and evolving \-\-- resilience through information sharing is the only way to ensure sustained resilience prevents escalation

[The point of this article is that [the enterprise will never be]{.mark}
100% [secure. There are]{.mark}]{.underline} simply **[[too many]{.mark}
[threats]{.mark} to ensure that]{.underline}**. Consequently,
[[organizations should]{.mark} stop [view]{.mark}ing [security
in]{.mark} access control enforcement terms and start treating it as a
[comprehensive]{.mark}, fully integrated, **strategic
management**]{.underline} responsibility that is rooted in enterprise
architecture. [Thus, organizations need to approach the problem as a
**[preparation, detection, response, and recovery]{.mark}**]{.underline}
challenge instead of viewing security in terms of classic walls and
access control. That will require a change in culture to accomplish.

[Cyber-resilience recognizes]{.underline} that [people]{.underline} are
the weakest link. It acknowledges that workers [will make mistakes, and
that intruders using advanced hacking tools will find
cracks]{.underline} in even the most robust cybersecurity system (Lois,
2015). Accordingly, [cyber-resilience needs to be integrated into the
"**bones" of the organization**]{.underline}. [That requires the
organization to create a well-defined architecture and implement
explicit control]{.underline} over the interdependencies among
processes, including those that apply to every electronic, human and
physical asset in the enterprise's infrastructure.

[Cyber-resilience is not a defensive stance]{.underline}, which is
focused on detecting network intrusions, or fixing malware. Instead,
[the [resilience]{.mark} concept [enables **practical survival in the
face of attack**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [effective
implementation of a cyber-resilient enterprise requires **strategic
vision**]{.underline}. It also requires day-to-day engagement across the
enterprise. This is rooted in the specialized actions and collaborations
with the classic cybersecurity function, which implies an effective
amalgamation of cybersecurity and cyber-resilience strategies. Although
the role of the latter focuses more on identification, authentication,
authorization, and enforcement, a cyber-resilient mindset is also
essential when cyber-defenses fail.

Fundamentally, the organization needs to survive. The increased presence
of advanced cyberthreats makes it inevitable that a targeted
organization will ultimately be compromised. Therefore, every
organization's critical systems must be assured safe under any realistic
set of conditions. Lost data or ancillary functionality can be restored
afterward. But the basic things that the organization needs to endure
must be maintained safe. [Cyber-resilient organizations are able to
"tough-out" cyber-attacks and continue to accomplish their critical
mission]{.underline} and satisfy their business goals,
[[Redesigning]{.mark} or updating [systems for resilience will make
attacks **less likely to succeed; minimize the
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline} when they do succeed;
**[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** cost and uncertainty for the
adversary; and possibly act as a **[[deterrent]{.underline}]{.mark}**
against future attacks. Consequently, investment in building
cyber-resilience is investment in organizational survival.

"[A long-term [outage]{.mark}]{.underline} owing to EMP [[could

]{.mark}[population [living in conditions similar to centuries

[people]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through the effects of **[societal
collapse, disease and starvation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While national
planning and preparation for such events could help mitigate the damage,
few such actions are currently under way or even being contemplated."
--- Congressional EMP Commission (2017)

The people of Rangely, Colo., are not waiting for Washington to protect
them from a Great American Blackout caused by a solar superstorm or
cyber warfare or electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack. Like several other
Western municipalities, Rangely, a town of 2,300 in northwest Colorado,
home to a community college, has rolled up its sleeves and, in the best
traditions of Western pioneering spirit, independence and
self-sufficiency, is building redundant microgrids so they can survive
anything.

Texas state Sen. Bob Hall and his colleagues aren't waiting for
Washington to "provide for the common defense," either. Hall's bill to
protect the Texas electric grid from all hazards --- including EMP,
cyber warfare and sabotage --- recently passed the state Senate.

[[Texans had a]{.mark} small [taste of "electronic
apocalypse]{.mark}]{.underline}" in February [when an ice storm caused
statewide rolling blackouts, resulting in property [damage totaling
billions]{.mark} of dollars, [fuel shortages]{.mark}]{.underline}
including a reduction in the national fuel supply, [[industrial
accidents,]{.mark} including a [major explosion]{.mark} and fire in a
chemical plant, and]{.underline} 100 deaths. [Experts have cautioned the
same could happen during hot, summer weather.]{.underline}

Sen. Hall, a former Air Force officer and an EMP expert, has been
warning [[Texas]{.underline}]{.mark} for years that [electric grid
vulnerability]{.underline} to EMP and cyber attack could have
catastrophic consequences. The Electric Reliability Council Of Texas
(ERCOT), which manages the state's electricity infrastructure,
[[proved]{.underline}]{.mark} in February **[[that they and the
utilities are not]{.mark} even [prepared to cope with a severe]{.mark}
ice [storm]{.mark},]{.underline}** let alone existential threats from
EMP and cyber warfare.

#### Blackouts cause extinction

[**Morris 17**]{.underline} \-\-- Craig Morris, co-author of Energy
Democracy, the first history of Germany's Energiewende, "After two weeks
without power, civilization collapses", Energy Transition, Oct 2^nd^
2017,
https://energytransition.org/2017/10/after-two-weeks-without-power-civilization-collapses/

Elsberg started work on the book in 2008. Just before he finished,
Germany's Office of Technology Assessment (TAB) published its own
scientific study on what [[a]{.mark}n extended [blackout
would]{.mark}]{.underline} look like (PDF in German). Entitled "The
vulnerability of modern societies: a case study of a large-scale
blackout," the study [[reveal]{.underline}]{.mark}ed [**[lots of scary
things]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

For instance, [people would not only be without [drinking water]{.mark},
but]{.underline} the [piping]{.underline} itself [[would become
"**irreparably**" contaminated]{.underline}]{.mark} within weeks.
[[Chaos would]{.mark} quickly [break]{.mark} [out]{.mark}]{.underline}
because all forms of communication -- cell phones, radio, television,
internet, etc. -- would stop working, and [people would lack power for
batteries in their devices]{.underline} anyway (how many of you have a
hand-crank flashlight or radio?). [Those with backup generators would
run out of fuel]{.underline} because the [authorities would
confiscate]{.underline} the available [supply]{.underline} (fuel pumps
require power) for emergency services.

Elsberg took account of some findings from the study in his novel, but
he says he basically already had the situation described well. For the
first few days, people deal with the inconvenience well. Everyone has a
little food and water at home, and grocery stores contain a few days of

nuclear EMP [event]{.underline}, [given]{.underline} current
[**[unpreparedness]{.underline}**, [would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely
[[result in **societal collapse**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Terrorists,
criminals, and even lone individuals can build a non-nuclear EMP weapon
without great trouble or expense, working from Unclassified designs
publicly available on the internet, and using parts available at any
electronics store. In 2000, the Terrorism Panel of the House Armed
Services Committee sponsored an experiment, recruiting a small team of
amateur electronics enthusiasts to attempt constructing a radiofrequency
weapon, relying only on unclassified design information and parts
purchased from Radio Shack. The team, in 1 year, built two
radiofrequency weapons of radically different designs. One was designed
to fit inside the shipping crate for a Xerox machine, so it could be
delivered to the Pentagon mail room where (in those more unguarded days
before 9/11) it could slowly fry the Pentagon's computers. The other
radiofrequency weapon was designed to fit inside a small Volkswagon bus,
so it could be driven down Wall Street and disrupt computers--- and
perhaps the National economy. Both designs were demonstrated and tested
successfully during a special Congressional hearing for this purpose at
the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground. Radiofrequency weapons are not
merely a hypothetical threat. Terrorists, criminals, and disgruntled
individuals have used home-made radiofrequency weapons. The U.S.
military and foreign militaries have a wide variety of such weaponry.
Moreover, non-nuclear EMP devices that could be used as radiofrequency
weapons are publicly marketed for sale to anyone, usually advertised as
''EMP simulators.'' For example, one such simulator is advertised for
public sale as an ''EMP Suitcase.'' This EMP simulator is designed to
look like a suitcase, can be carried and operated by one person, and is
purpose-built with a high energy radiofrequency output to destroy
electronics. However, it has only a short radius of effect. Nonetheless,
a terrorist or deranged individual who knows what he is doing, who has
studied the electric grid for a major metropolitan area, could---armed
with the ''EMP Suitcase''--- black out a major city. A CLEAR AND PRESENT
DANGER. An EMP weapon can be used by state actors who wish to level the
battlefield by neutralizing the great technological advantage enjoyed by
U.S. military forces. EMP is also the ideal means, the only means,
whereby rogue states or terrorists could use a single nuclear weapon to
destroy the United States and prevail in the War on Terrorism or some
other conflict with a single blow. The EMP Commission also warned that
states or terrorists could exploit U.S. vulnerability to EMP attack for
coercion or blackmail: ''Therefore, terrorists or state actors that
possess relatively unsophisticated missiles armed with nuclear weapons
may well calculate that, instead of destroying a city or military base,
they may obtain the greatest political-military utility from one or a
few such weapons by using them---or threatening their use---in an EMP
attack.'' The EMP Commission found that states such as Russia, China,
North Korea, and Iran have incorporated EMP attack into their military
doctrines, and openly describe making EMP attacks against the United
States. Indeed, the EMP Commission was established by Congress partly in
response to a Russian nuclear EMP threat made to an official
Congressional Delegation on May 2, 1999, in the midst of the Balkans
crisis. Vladimir Lukin, head of the Russian delegation and a former
Ambassador to the United States, warned: ''Hypothetically, if Russia
really wanted to hurt the United States in retaliation for NATO's
bombing of Yugoslavia, Russia could fire an SLBM and detonate a single
nuclear warhead at high altitude over the United States. The resulting
EMP would massively disrupt U.S. communications and computer systems,
shutting down everything.'' China's military doctrine also openly
describes EMP attack as the ultimate asymmetric weapon, as it strikes at
the very technology that is the basis of U.S. power. Where EMP is
concerned, ''The United States is more vulnerable to attacks than any
other country in the world'': ''Some people might think that things
similar to the 'Pearl Harbor Incident' are unlikely to take place during
the information age. Yet it could be regarded as the 'Pearl Harbor
Incident' of the 21st Century if a surprise attack is conducted against
the enemy's crucial information systems of command, control, and
communications by such means as... electromagnetic pulse weapons... Even
a superpower like the United States, which possesses nuclear missiles
and powerful armed forces, cannot guarantee its immunity...In their own
words, a highly computerized open society like the United States is
extremely vulnerable to electronic attacks from all sides. This is
because the U.S. economy, from banks to telephone systems and from power
plants to iron and steel works, relies entirely on computer networks...
When a country grows increasingly powerful economically and
technologically...it will become increasingly dependent on modern
information systems... The United States is more vulnerable to attacks
than any other country in the world.'' Iran---the world's leading
sponsor of international terrorism---in military writings openly
describes EMP as a terrorist weapon, and as the ultimate weapon for
prevailing over the West: ''If the world's industrial countries fail to
devise effective ways to defend themselves against dangerous electronic
assaults, then they will disintegrate within a few years... American
soldiers would not be able to find food to eat nor would they be able to
fire a single shot.'' The threats are not merely words. The EMP
Commission assesses that Russia has, as it openly declares in military
writings, probably developed what Russia describes as a ''Super-EMP''
nuclear weapon---specifically designed to generate extraordinarily high
EMP fields in order to paralyze even the best protected U.S. strategic
and military forces. China probably also has Super-EMP weapons. North
Korea too may possess or be developing a Super-EMP nuclear weapon, as
alleged by credible Russian sources to the EMP Commission, and by
open-source reporting from South Korean military intelligence. But any
nuclear weapon, even a low-yield first generation device, could suffice
to make a catastrophic EMP attack on the United States. Iran, although
it is assessed as not yet having the bomb, is actively testing missile
delivery systems and has practiced launches of its best missile, the
Shahab--III, fuzing for high- altitude detonations, in exercises that
look suspiciously like training for making EMP attacks. As noted
earlier, Iran has also practiced launching from a ship a Scud, the
world's most common missile---possessed by over 60 nations, terrorist
groups, and private collectors. A Scud might be the ideal choice for a
ship-launched EMP attack against the United States intended to be
executed anonymously, to escape any last-gasp U.S. retaliation. Unlike a
nuclear weapon detonated in a city, a high-altitude EMP attack leaves no
bomb debris for forensic analysis, no perpetrator ''fingerprints.''
Under present levels of preparedness, communications would be severely
limited, restricted mainly to those few military communications networks
that are hardened against EMP. Today's microelectronics are the
foundation of our modern civilization, but are over 1 million times more
vulnerable to EMP than the far more primitive and robust electronics of
the 1960s, that proved vulnerable during nuclear EMP tests of that era.
Tests conducted by the EMP Commission confirmed empirically the theory
that, as modern microelectronics become ever smaller and more efficient,
and operate ever faster on lower voltages, they also become ever more
vulnerable, and can be destroyed or disrupted by much lower EMP field
strengths. Microelectronics and electronic systems are everywhere, and
run virtually everything in the modern world. All of the civilian
critical infrastructures that sustain the economy of the United States,
and the lives of 310 million Americans, depend, directly or indirectly,
upon electricity and electronic systems. Of special concern is the
vulnerability to EMP of the Extra-High-Voltage (EHV) transformers, that
are indispensable to the operation of the electric grid. EHV
transformers drive electric current over long distances, from the point
of generation to consumers (from the Niagara Falls hydroelectric
facility to New York City, for example). The electric grid cannot
operate without EHV transformers---which could be destroyed by an EMP
event. The United States no longer manufactures EHV transformers. They
must be manufactured and imported from overseas, from Germany or South
Korea, the only two nations in the world that manufacture such
transformers for export. Each EHV transformer must be custom-made for
its unique role in the grid. A single EHV transformer typically requires
18 months to manufacture. The loss of large numbers of EHV transformers
to an EMP event would plunge the United States into a protracted
blackout lasting years, with perhaps no hope of eventual recovery, as
the society and population probably could not survive for even 1 year
without electricity. Another key vulnerability to EMP are Supervisory
Control And Data Acquisition systems (SCADAs). SCADAs essentially are
small computers, numbering in the millions and ubiquitous everywhere in
the critical infrastructures, that perform jobs previously performed by
hundreds of thousands of human technicians during the 1960s and before,
in the era prior to the microelectronics revolution. SCADAs do things
like regulating the flow of electricity into a transformer, controlling
the flow of gas through a pipeline, or running traffic control lights.
SCADAs enable a few dozen people to run the critical infrastructures for
an entire city, whereas previously hundreds or even thousands of
technicians were necessary. Unfortunately, SCADAs are especially
vulnerable to EMP. EHV transformers and SCADAs are the most important
vulnerabilities to EMP, but are by no means the only vulnerabilities.
Each of the critical infrastructures has their own unique
vulnerabilities to EMP: The National electric grid, with its
transformers and generators and electronic controls and thousands of
miles of power lines, is a vast electronic machine---more vulnerable to
EMP than any other critical infrastructure. Yet [[the]{.mark} electric
[grid is the **most important of all**]{.mark} **[critical]{.mark}
[infrastructures]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and is in fact [the
**keystone**]{.mark} **[supporting]{.mark} modern
[civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as it powers **all the other
critical infrastructures**]{.underline}. [As of now it is our
**technological Achilles Heel**]{.underline}. The EMP Commission found
that, [if the electric grid collapses, so too will collapse **all the
other critical infrastructures**]{.underline}. But, if the electric grid
can be protected and recovered, so too all the other critical
infrastructures can also be restored. **[Transportation]{.underline}**
is a critical infrastructure because modern [civilization cannot exist
without the goods and services moved by road, rail, ship, and
air]{.underline}. Cars, trucks, locomotives, ships, and aircraft all
have electronic components, motors, and controls that are potentially
vulnerable to EMP. Gas stations, fuel pipelines, and refineries that
make petroleum products depend upon electronic components and cannot
operate without electricity. Given our current state of unpreparedness,
in the aftermath of a natural or nuclear EMP event, transportation
systems would be paralyzed. **[Traffic control systems]{.underline}**
that avert traffic jams and collisions for road, rail, and air depend
upon electronic systems, that the EMP Commission discovered are
especially vulnerable to EMP. **[Communications]{.underline}** is a
critical infrastructure because modern economies and [the cohesion and
operation of modern societies depend to a degree unprecedented in
history on the rapid movement of information]{.underline}---accomplished
today mostly by electronic means. Telephones, cell phones, personal
computers, television, and radio are all directly vulnerable to EMP, and
cannot operate without electricity. Satellites that operate at
Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) for communications, weather, scientific, and
military purposes are vulnerable to EMP and to collateral effects from
an EMP attack. Within weeks of an EMP event, the LEO satellites, which
comprise most satellites, would probably be inoperable. **[Banking and
finance]{.underline}** [are the critical infrastructure that sustain
modern economies.]{.underline} Whether it is the stock market, the
financial records of a multinational corporation, or the ATM card of an
individual---financial transactions and record keeping all depend now at
the macro- and micro-level upon computers and electronic automated
systems. Many of these are directly vulnerable to EMP, and none can
operate [without electricity]{.underline}. The EMP Commission found that
[an]{.underline} EMP [event could transform the modern electronic
economy into a **feudal economy based on barter**.
**[Food]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[has always been]{.underline} **[vital
to]{.underline}**]{.mark} every person and **[every
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The critical infrastructure for
producing, delivering, and storing food depends upon a **complex web of
technology**,]{.underline} [including machines for planting and
harvesting and packaging, refrigerated vehicles for long-haul
transportation, and temperature-controlled warehouses.]{.underline}
[Modern technology enables over **98 percent of the U.S. National
population**]{.underline} to be fed by less than 2 percent of the
population. Huge regional warehouses that resupply supermarkets
constitute the National food reserves, enough food to feed the Nation
for 30--60 days at normal consumption rates, the warehoused food
preserved by refrigeration and temperature control systems that
typically have enough emergency electrical power (diesel or gas
generators) to last only about an average of 3 days. [Experience with
storm-induced blackouts proves that [when]{.mark} these big [regional
food warehouses]{.mark} [lose]{.mark} electrical [power]{.mark}, **[most
of the food supply will]{.mark} rapidly [spoil]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[Farmers]{.underline}]{.mark}, less than 2 percent of the population as
noted above, **[[cannot feed]{.mark} 310 million
[Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[if deprived of]{.mark} the means
that currently makes possible this [tech]{.mark}nological
miracle.]{.underline} Water too has always been a basic necessity to
every person and civilization, even more crucial than food. The critical
infrastructure for purifying and delivering potable water, and for
disposing of and treating waste water, is a vast networked machine
powered by electricity that uses electrical pumps, screens, filters,
paddles, and sprayers to purify and deliver drinkable water, and to
remove and treat waste water. Much of the machinery in the water
infrastructure is directly vulnerable to EMP. The system cannot operate
without vast amounts of electricity supplied by the power grid. A
natural or nuclear EMP event would immediately deprive most of the U.S.
National population of running water. Many natural sources of
water---lakes, streams, and rivers---would be dangerously polluted by
toxic wastes from sewage, industry, and hospitals that would backflow
from or bypass wastewater treatment plants, that could no longer intake
and treat pollutants without electric power. Many natural water sources
that would normally be safe to drink, after an EMP event, would be
polluted with human wastes including feces, industrial wastes including
arsenic and heavy metals, and hospital wastes including pathogens.
Emergency services such as police, fire, and hospitals are the critical
infrastructure that upholds the most basic functions of government and
society---preserving law and order, protecting property and life.
Experience from protracted storm-induced blackouts has shown, for
example in the aftermath of Hurricanes Andrew and Katrina, that when the
lights go out and communications systems fail and there is no gas for
squad cars, fire trucks, and ambulances, [the worst elements of society
and the worst human instincts **rapidly takeover**]{.underline}. The EMP
Commission found that, [given our current]{.underline} state of
[[unpreparedness]{.underline}]{.mark}, a natural or nuclear EMP event
[could [create **anarchic conditions**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} would
**profoundly [challenge]{.mark} the [existence of social
order]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Nuclear Reactors for Military Installations: Capabilities, Costs, and

The DOD interest in small reactors derives largely from problems with
base and logistics vulnerability. Over the last few years, the Services
have begun to reexamine virtually every aspect of how they generate and
use energy with an eye toward cutting costs, decreasing carbon
emissions, and reducing energy-related vulnerabilities. These actions
have resulted in programs that have significantly reduced DOD energy
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions at domestic bases. Despite
strong efforts, however, two [critical security issues have]{.underline}
thus far [proven resistant to existing solutions: bases' vulnerability
to civilian power outages, and the need to transport large quantities of
fuel via convoys]{.underline} through hostile territory to forward
locations. Each of these is explored below. Grid Vulnerability. [[DOD is
unable to provide]{.mark} its [bases with electricity when the]{.mark}
civilian electrical [grid is offline]{.mark} for an extended period of
time]{.underline}. Currently, [domestic military installations receive
99 percent of their electricity from the civilian power
grid]{.underline}. As explained in a recent study from the Defense
Science Board: DOD's key problem with electricity is that
[[critical]{.mark} missions, such as national [strategic awareness
and]{.mark} national [command authorities, are]{.mark}]{.underline}
almost [entirely [dependent on the]{.mark} national transmission
[grid]{.mark}]{.underline} . . . \[[[which\] is]{.mark} fragile,
[vulnerable,]{.mark} near its capacity limit, and outside of DOD
control]{.underline}. In most cases, [[neither the grid nor]{.mark}
on-base [backup power provides]{.mark} sufficient [reliability]{.mark}
to ensure continuity of critical national priority functions and
oversight of strategic missions in the face of a long term (several
months) outage]{.underline}.7 [The grid's fragility was demonstrated
during the 2003 Northeast blackout]{.underline} in which 50 million
people in the United States and Canada lost power, some for up to a
week, when one Ohio utility failed to properly trim trees. The blackout
created cascading disruptions in sewage systems, gas station pumping,
cellular communications, border check systems, and so forth, and
demonstrated the interdependence of modern infrastructural systems.8
More recently, awareness has been growing [that the grid is]{.underline}
also [vulnerable to purposive attacks]{.underline}. A report sponsored
by the Department of Homeland Security suggests that a coordinated
cyberattack on the grid could result in a third of the country losing
power for a period of weeks or months.9 Cyberattacks on critical
infrastructure are not well understood. It is not clear, for instance,
whether existing [terrorist groups might be able to develop the
capability to conduct this type of attack]{.underline}. It is likely,
however, [that some nation-states either have or are working on
developing the ability to take down the U.S. grid]{.underline}. In the
event of a war with one of these states, [it is possible, if not likely,
that parts of the civilian grid would cease to function, taking with
them military bases located in affected regions]{.underline}. Government
and private [organizations are currently working to secure the grid
against]{.underline} [attacks]{.underline}; however, [it is not clear
that they will be successful]{.underline}. Most military bases currently
have backup power that allows them to function for a period of hours or,
at most, a few days on their own. If power were not restored after this
amount of time, the results could be disastrous. First, [military assets
taken offline by the crisis would not be available to help with disaster
relief]{.underline}. Second, [during an extended blackout, [global
military operations could be seriously compromised]{.mark}; this
disruption would be particularly serious if the blackout was induced
during major combat operations]{.underline}. During the Cold War, this
type of event was far less likely because the United States and Soviet
Union shared the common understanding that [[blinding an
opponent]{.mark} with a grid blackout [could escalate to nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [America's current opponents]{.underline},
however, [may not share this fear or be deterred by this
possibility]{.underline}. In 2008, the Defense Science Board stressed
that [DOD should mitigate the electrical grid's vulnerabilities by
turning military installations into "islands]{.underline}" of energy
self-sufficiency. [The department has made efforts to do so by promoting
efficiency programs]{.underline} that lower power consumption on bases
and by [constructing [renewable]{.mark} power generation
[facilities]{.mark}]{.underline} on selected bases. [Unfortunately,
these programs [will not]{.mark} come close to reaching the goal of
[island]{.mark}ing [the vast majority of
bases]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Even with massive investment in
efficiency and renewables, [most bases would not be able to
function]{.mark} for more than a few days]{.underline} after the
civilian grid went offline [Unlike other alternative sources of energy,
small reactors have the potential to solve DOD's vulnerability to grid
outages]{.underline}. Most bases have relatively light power demands
when compared to civilian towns or cities. [Small reactors could easily
support bases' power demands separate from the civilian grid during
crises]{.underline}. In some cases, [the reactors could be designed to
produce enough power not only to supply the base, but also to provide
critical services in surrounding towns during long-term
outages]{.underline}. Strategically, islanding bases with small reactors
has another benefit. [One of the main reasons an enemy might be willing
to risk reprisals by taking down the U.S. grid during a period of
military hostilities would be to affect ongoing military operations.
Without the lifeline of]{.underline} intelligence, communication, and
logistics provided by [U.S. domestic bases, American military operations
would be compromised in almost any conceivable contingency. Making bases
more resilient to civilian power outages would reduce the incentive for
an opponent to attack the grid]{.underline}. An opponent might still
attempt to take down the grid for the sake of disrupting civilian
systems, but [the powerful incentive to do so in order to win an ongoing
battle or war would be greatly reduced]{.underline}.

[We face a severe potential emergency]{.underline}. External threats
serve to unite. The world faces an unrecognized nuclear peril! Uniting
to confront it can generate the missing popular and government support
to generate millions of jobs and revitalize the global economy.

A THREAT GREATER THAN ANY TERROR ATTACK!

A NASA funded study by the National Academy of Sciences was titled
Severe Space Weather Events\--Understanding Societal and Economic
Impacts. The resulting Report detailed what might happen in the event of
a solar megastorm launching a powerful Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) that
strikes our geomagnetic field. The study predicts [[blackouts]{.mark}
that [may last for years]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the map above
indicates, highly vulnerable areas include most of the Eastern and
Northwestern parts of the nation.

The NOAA estimates each 11 year sunspot cycle is capable of launching 4
\"extreme\" (X class) CMEs and 100 \"severe\" CMEs at the earth. More X
class events than were anticipated have occurred in the current cycle.
The most dangerous period is the next 5 years. The peak peril is
predicted by some to occur in May, 2013.

So far, neither NASA nor NOAA have publicly acknowledged the mortal
threat these events may cause as the result of multiple meltdowns of
nuclear plants worldwide. To date, [[there is no
indication]{.underline}]{.mark} that the White House, Congress, Homeland
Security, the Department of Defense and/or [the
**[N]{.mark}**]{.underline}uclear **[[R]{.underline}]{.mark}**egulatory

to prevent]{.underline} the [horrendous effects]{.underline} of such a

The recent statement by a NASA scientist that human life would not end
as the result of the direct effects of a solar storm during 2012 is
misleading. A solar megastorm that causes [[widespread meltdowns
of]{.mark} numerous [nuclear]{.mark} power [plants can **seriously

### Ext \-\-- Grid Collapse Turns Economy

#### A cyberattack on the grid collapses the economy and invites lethal terror attacks

**[Barletta 16]{.underline}** (Lou Barletta, Congressman of
Pennsylvania's 11^th^ Congressional District, 6/2/16, "Attack on
electrical grid could collapse economy,"
https://barletta.house.gov/media-center/opinion-editorials/attack-on-electrical-grid-could-collapse-economy)

It was like something from a Hollywood movie, but it was real. At about
3:30 p.m. on Dec. 23, a computer in an electricity distribution center
[in western Ukraine]{.underline} seemed to take on a life of its own.
While a helpless worker watched, the cursor on the screen moved by
itself and clicked on a box that opened a series of circuit breakers ---
a move that would take the entire power station offline. When a dialogue
box appeared asking for confirmation of the command, the ghostly cursor
moved again and completed the action. Reaching frantically for the
mouse, the worker tried to abort what was happening, but the computer
was being controlled from elsewhere. In all, [about 30 substations were
taken out of commission and 225,000 customers were suddenly cut off from
the power supply. It marked what is believed to be the world's first
successful cyber-attack on a nation's power grid]{.underline}. What
happened is ominous because [it reminded us that [we should not believe
ourselves immune to]{.mark} such an [attack]{.mark}, even in the United
States. [A cyberattack on the power grid could leave millions of
residents and key physical locations without power for an extended
period of time]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is a discouraging fact that
unlike every other hazard we are likely to face, from hurricanes to
earthquakes and chemical attacks to space weather[, there is no specific
planning scenario to help state and local governments prepare for an
extensive blackout]{.underline}. This prompts a blizzard of questions:
How long will the power be out? How many people will be impacted? What
backups need to be in place to protect our citizens? With this in mind,
I hosted an April hearing on the consequences of a massive, coordinated
attack on the electrical grid, in my role as chairman of the House
Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Economic
Development, Public Buildings and Emergency Management. We asked our
witnesses from the Department of Energy, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security to provide the
realistic timeframe for which we should be prepared for the power to be
out. FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate was clear, saying, "Planning needs
to be measured in weeks." The other witnesses agreed. As a former mayor
of my hometown of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, I know that localities will be
on the front lines during a widespread, lengthy outage and will be
tasked with handling much of the response. While our subcommittee
witnesses tried to assure us that there were numerous efforts underway
to help prepare state and local governments for the unthinkable, the
mayors and local elected officials I frequently talk to feel they do not
have all the information they need to prepare for such a catastrophe. We
must be ready to deal [[with disruptions in telecommunications, water
and waste]{.mark} treatment, [healthcare]{.mark} delivery, [**financial
services** and transportation]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is no question
that good communication is vital during the reaction to a disaster, but
it is also critical when crafting a response strategy in advance. Since
I believe that all disasters are local events, it is important that we
tie in localities with states and the federal government so that the
greatest coordination can be achieved. All levels of government must
cooperate and anticipate all types of disasters. The FBI and the
Homeland Security Department are hosting briefings for local
governments, law enforcement, and energy companies to discuss and
develop strategies for mitigating risk and providing better defense. In
addition, I have been meeting with the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, the Edison Electric Institute, the American
Public Power Association and the National Rural Electric Cooperative
Association. These national organizations have committed to identify
initiatives that cut across all levels of government and create plans we
can put in the hands of officials at the state and local levels. Some
pre-planning has already been undertaken, such as exercises conducted by
NERC and PPL --- one of the largest electric utilities in the nation. At
our hearing, PPL President and CEO Bill Spence told of regular internal
exercises and external drills with other utilities to practice their
responses to various disaster scenarios. By extending this training by
linking up state and local officials to the utilities, relationships
will be formed, information will be shared, and efforts will be
maximized[. [If the goal]{.mark} of terrorists [is to collapse our
economy, then shutting down our electrical grid is where they would
start]{.mark}. Most troubling is the possibility that a cyberattack
would be accompanied by a physical terrorist attack, [a scenario that
promises]{.mark} true [havoc, panic and loss of life]{.mark}. The great
challenge is that the threat continues to evolve]{.underline}, which
only means that we are forced to evolve with it and be prepared for it.

[)//EQ]{.underline}

[A recent poll showed that more than 90 percent of Americans believe the
government is not doing enough to protect the electric grid from
cybersecurity attacks. Their fears appear to be justified. This month,
the U.S. government revealed its concerns about Russian [incursions into
the]{.mark} operating systems of domestic [electric power plants]{.mark}
and noted that the efforts to disrupt date back to 2013. These attacks
[have the capability to bring down]{.mark} all or part of [our
**electricity service**]{.mark}. Such large-scale grid cyberattacks were
foreseen. The Departments of Energy and Homeland Security identified the
grid's vulnerability to cyberattacks some time ago and called for new
protective measures in the DOE-led January 2017 Quadrennial Energy
Review. The study, which analyzed the entire U.S. electricity system,
noted that that [the **key critical infrastructures** underpinning the
nation's **economy and national security**]{.mark} --- transportation,
water, finance, natural gas, oil, communications/IT --- [depend upon a
reliable electricity]{.mark} "uber-[network]{.mark}." A 2012 report by
the National Research Council concluded that [a cyberattack could black
out a large region]{.mark} of the nation for weeks or even months.
**Public [health and safety would be in jeopardy]{.mark}** from an
extended, widespread power outage, resulting in loss of life support
systems in hospitals, nursing homes, and households, disruption of clean
water supplies and sanitation, and a massive breakdown of the
transportation system. Th[e economic disruptions]{.mark} from an
extended blackout [would]{.mark} also [be enormous]{.mark}. A 2015
Lloyds of London study found that a cyberattack on 50 generators in the
Northeast could leave 93 million people without power and cost the
economy over \$234 billion. We've already seen previews of a successful
cyberattack on the grid stemming from operational failures and extreme
weather. The 2003 Northeast blackout left 50 million people without
power for four days, causing economic losses between \$4 billion and
\$10 billion. In Puerto Rico, 400,000 people are still without power six
months after Hurricane Maria, with staggering impacts on the
commonwealth's economy and well-being. Russia, Iran, North Korea and
others have large-scale, offensive cyberattack programs. The CIA has
concluded with "high confidence" that Russian military attackers
crippled computers in Ukraine's financial system last year. This
followed 2015 and 2016 cyberattacks that disabled part of Ukraine's
electric grid. Global security analysts say Russia is using Ukraine as a
cyberwar testing ground. The U.S. also appears to be in their crosshairs
as the overall U.S.-Russia relationship hits new lows, evidenced most
dramatically by their interference in our 2016 elections. According to
DHS and the FBI, Russia appears to be laying a foundation for a large
scale cyberattack on U.S. infrastructure. The Dragonfly 2.0 hackers,
identified by DHS as Russian government cyber actors, pursued a
prolonged cyberattack (since 2015) on a U.S. power plant and computer
networks controlling the grid. Industry and government have been trying
to address cyber vulnerabilities. In 2015, Congress expanded DOE's
authority to take immediate measures in response to cyberattacks on the
grid in the FAST Act. Congress has also proposed additional legislation
to address grid-related cyber-defense deficiencies with resilience
measures for electricity infrastructure. These bills --- introduced but
not passed --- focus on state assistance, authority to address
cybersecurity gaps for other energy infrastructures, and identification
of cybersecure products for the grid. Energy Secretary Rick Perry should
also be commended for setting up a new cybersecurity office at DOE.
These actions are important but not enough. It is time for a
comprehensive examination of how we anticipate, recover, and deter
cyberattacks. We need to fund development and deployment of advanced
designs and technologies to protect our grid and to provide states the
tools they need to contribute to the defense of the nation's electricity
system. We need to incorporate mandatory reliability and resilience
measures into every aspect of our electricity system and the internet.
We must also address state-sponsored cyberattacks at the legal,
regulatory, operational and diplomatic levels, including the development
of international protocols. But the hardest part may be modernizing our
jurisdictional system to ensure seamless federal authority to prepare
for and respond to cyberattacks. The DOE study concluded that the
electricity system is a national security asset. National security is
inherently a federal responsibility and cybersecurity attacks do not
respect jurisdictional boundaries. It is time to adopt a regulatory
system that meets 21st century realities. Our economy and national
security depend on it]{.underline}

#### Grid attacks likely

**[Stringer 21]{.underline}** \-\-- David Stringer, Asia Energy Team

Vulnerable to Cyber Attacks"
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/why-global-power-grids-are-still-so-vulnerable-to-cyber-attacks#xj4y7vzkg

[More than five years after massive cyber attacks left]{.underline} a
quarter of a million [Ukrainians without electricity, [the world's power
grids have become]{.mark}]{.underline} **[even [more vulnerable]{.mark}
to hackers.]{.underline}**

[[As utilities turn]{.mark} to]{.underline} sources of [renewable energy
and add millions of other components like [smart]{.mark} meters,
[they're rapidly multiplying]{.mark} the number of [connections and
sensors]{.mark}]{.underline} along their networks, widening the
potential for intrusions.

"[Power [grids are getting **increasingly vulnerable because of
digitalization**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the use of more smart
applications," said Daine Loh, a Singapore-based power and renewables
analyst at Fitch Solutions.

[It's a threat highlighted in an initial probe in India that found
[a]{.mark}]{.underline}n October [[blackout]{.underline}]{.mark} in
Mumbai [may have been caused by cyber sabotage. That outage **[impacted
stock markets]{.mark}, trains [and]{.mark} thousands of households in
[the nation's financial hub]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The disruptive
potential]{.underline}]{.mark} [of grid failures]{.underline} \-- as
seen in Texas last month due to a sudden deep freeze \-- [[makes the
sector a key target]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly
[[for]{.underline}]{.mark} state-based [[hostile
actors.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Over the past]{.underline} four [decades, power plants and substations
have been moving from manual to [automatic]{.mark}
[controls]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[and [are increasingly being
connected]{.mark}]{.underline}** to public and private networks for
remote access, leaving them exposed to attacks. Producers and
distributors have also often been reluctant to spend on protecting
themselves against low-probability attacks.

"India's power system is in urgent need of proper cybersecurity
systems," said Reji Kumar Pillai, president of India Smart Grid Forum, a
think-tank backed by the federal power ministry and which advises
governments, regulators and utilities. "Both the state and the central
governments need to treat this with utmost urgency, without waiting for
a disaster to happen."

[[There's been a sharp rise]{.mark} over the past two years [in cyber
attacks targeting critical infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[including grids]{.underline}, and it's also becoming easier for hackers
to gain access to key equipment, according to Darktrace, a
U.K.-headquartered security provider.

"There is now a path for attackers to run from spoof emails in an
employee's inbox right through to critical gas compressors and
turbines," said Sanjay Aurora, Darktrace's managing director,
Asia-Pacific.

The U.S. Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security
Administration said in December they were among targets in a suspected
Russia-backed hack. Nuclear Power Corp. of India Ltd. said in 2019 that
malware infected a computer network used for administrative functions.

Attacks aren't confined to power grids. Recorded Future, a privately
held cybersecurity firm based near Boston that tracks malicious activity
by nation-state actors, said it noticed activity by a China-linked group
against an Indian maritime port this week.

"[Essential state infrastructures like **[power
grids]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline} **[nuclear
reactors]{.underline}** [have been and will continue to be a target of
cyber attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} [because modernization allows
internet connectivity]{.underline}, which makes them vulnerable," said
Kim Seungjoo, a professor at Korea University's School of Cybersecurity.
"It's almost a natural instinct of hackers, especially the
state-sponsored ones, to attack energy infrastructure because they can
easily disrupt national security."

### A2: No Grid Attacks

#### Actors have the [means]{.underline} and [motivations]{.underline} to strike critical infrastructure. 

**[Wintch 21]{.underline}** \-\-- Timothy M. Wintch, an active-duty

Physical Threats to the U.S. Power Grid and Keeping the Lights on",
https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/)

Among critical infrastructure sectors in the U.S., [energy]{.underline}
is perhaps the most crucial of the 16 sectors defined by the Department
of Homeland Security. This sector [is **so vital**]{.underline} [because
it provides the energy]{.underline} necessary [to run **every other**
critical infrastructure sector]{.underline}. However,
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. [power [grid]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
backbone of the energy sector, is built upon an aging skeleton that
[[is]{.mark} becoming [increasingly **vulnerable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
every day. Whether [[from terrorists or nation-states]{.mark} like
Russia and China]{.underline}, [the power grid is susceptible
to]{.underline} not just physical attacks, but also to [**cyber**
intrusion]{.underline} as well. However, much of this threat can be
mitigated if the U.S. takes the appropriate steps to safeguard the power
grid and avoid a potential catastrophe in the future.

Since Sept. 11, 2001, terrorism on U.S. soil has been at the forefront
of American consciousness. [[Critical infrastructure provides an
**appealing** target]{.underline} [because of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
disproportionally [**large [impact]{.mark}** even [a **small attack**
can have]{.mark} on the sectors]{.underline}. In particular, the power
grid represents a particularly lucrative target, both in terms of the
ease of access and the large impact it can make. The National Research
Council stated that the U.S. power grid is "vulnerable to intelligent
multi-site attacks by knowledgeable attackers intent on causing maximum
physical damage to key components on a wide geographical
scale."[\[1\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn1)
Additionally, the [physical security of transmission and
distribution]{.underline} systems is difficult due to the
**[dispersed]{.underline}** [nature of these]{.underline} key
[components]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [is advantageous
to attackers as it reduces]{.underline} the [likelihood of]{.underline}
their
[capture]{.underline}.[\[2\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn2)
From 2002-2012, approximately 2,500 physical attacks occurred against
transmission lines and towers worldwide and approximately 500 attacks
against transformer
substations.[\[3\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn3)
[[Terrorists have the **motivation**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to attack the
U.S. power grid]{.underline} but the very nature of the grid makes it
highly vulnerable. The power grid is not only at risk from physical
attacks, but also nation-state cyberattacks.

[[One nation that has shown]{.underline}]{.mark} both the
[[**capability** and **intent**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to use
attacks]{.underline} against critical energy infrastructure [[is
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [as demonstrated in]{.underline} their 2015
[annexation of Crimea]{.underline} from Ukraine. A Russian cyber threat
group known as [[Sandworm]{.underline}]{.mark}, which used its
BlackEnergy malware, attacked Ukrainian computer systems that provide
remote control of the Ukraine power
grid.[\[4\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn4)
This attack, and another in 2016, each [[left]{.underline}]{.mark} the
capital [[Kiev without power]{.underline}]{.mark},
[prompting]{.underline} cyber [experts to raise concern
about]{.underline} the same [malware]{.underline} already [existing in
NATO]{.underline} and the U.S. power
grids.[\[5\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn5)
In any conflict between Russia and NATO, not only would similar
cyberattacks pose a threat, but so would potential physical attacks
severing fuel oil and natural gas lines to Western Europe. Russia has
both the capability and intent to attack critical infrastructure,
particularly power grids, during future conflicts in their "hybrid
warfare" approach.

[Another nation]{.underline} that has the capability to attack critical
energy infrastructure [is China]{.underline}, representing a threat to
not just the U.S. energy infrastructure but also that of our allies
whose support would be vital in a major conflict. A recent NATO report
highlighted this threat from China's Belt and Road Initiative, stating
that "\[China's\] foreign direct investment in strategic sectors \[such
as energy generation and distribution\] ...raises questions about
whether access and control over such infrastructure can be maintained,
particularly in crisis when it would be required to support the
military."[\[6\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn6)
Like Russia, [[China has been **active** with]{.mark} cyber
**intrusions** in [U.S. energy **infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The Mission Support Center at Idaho National Laboratory characterized
these as attacks as "multiple intrusions into US ICS/SCADA \[Industrial
Control Systems/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition\] and smart
grid tools \[that\] may be aimed more at intellectual property theft and
gathering intelligence to bolster their own infrastructure, but it is
likely that [they are]{.underline} also [using]{.underline} these
[intrusions to develop capabilities to attack the]{.underline}
\[**[bulk]{.underline}** [electric system]{.underline}\], as
well."[\[7\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn7)
[China]{.underline}, therefore, [[has]{.mark} both the [**capability**
and **intent**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to conduct]{.underline}]{.mark}
cyber [[intrusions]{.mark} and attacks for myriad reasons.]{.underline}

Another arm of this threat is the reliance the U.S. energy industry has
on imports from China, especially transformers. In early 2020, federal
officials seized a transformer in the port of Houston that had been
imported by the Jiangsu Huapeng Transformer Company before sending it to
Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque. Sandia is contracted by the
U.S. Department of Energy for mitigating national security
threats.[\[8\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn8)
The Wall Street Journal reported that "Mike Howard, chief executive of
the Electric Power Research Institute, a utility-funded technical
organization, said that the diversion of a huge, expensive transformer
is so unusual -- in his experience, unprecedented -- that it
suggests officials had significant security
concerns."[\[9\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn9)
Previously destined for the Washington Area Power Administration's Ault,
Colo., substation, the transformer is believed to have been seized due
to "backdoor" exploitable hardware emplaced by the Chinese prior to
shipment.[\[10\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn10)
Shortly after these events, President Trump issued Executive Order
13920, "[Securing the United States Bulk-Power
System](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-securing-united-states-bulk-power-system/),"
essentially limiting the import of Chinese-built critical energy
infrastructure components due to concerns about
cybersecurity.[\[11\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn11)
Interestingly, Jiangsu Huapeng "boasted that it supported 10 percent of
New York City's electricity
load."[\[12\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn12)

Franklin Kramer, the former Assistant Secretary of Defense for
International Security Affairs, testified before a U.S. House of
Representatives Energy and Commerce subcommittee during an energy and
power hearing in 2011 and said that a "highly-coordinated and
[[structured]{.mark} cyber]{.underline}, physical, or blended [[attack
on]{.mark} the **[bulk power]{.mark}** system]{.underline}, however,
[[could result in]{.mark} long-term]{.underline}
([**[irreparable]{.underline}**) [damage to key]{.underline}]{.mark}
[system [components in]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple [simultaneous or
near-**[simultaneous strikes]{.mark}**]{.underline}." He added that "an

and cause [large population centers]{.underline} to [lose power for
**extended**
periods]{.underline}."[\[13\]](https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/infrastructure-security/perspective-cyber-and-physical-threats-to-the-u-s-power-grid-and-keeping-the-lights-on/#_ftn13)
Even the [inclusion of]{.underline} features such as [smart grids to
the]{.underline} overall grid [structure poses new
**vulnerabilities**]{.underline} [through their
connectivity]{.underline}. Kramer stated that "[such [connectivity

[attack on the

(**[cyber-resilience]{.underline}**) [[have become
**critical**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the success of

are regularly threatened by a broad range of potential
cyber-attacks]{.underline} coming from criminals, terrorists, or
hacktivists (He et al., 2016). [[Cyber-attackers use any available
channel to exploit]{.mark} poorly secured [systems]{.mark} for different
purposes, giving way to threats like harassment, corporate espionage,
extortion, stock market manipulation, or the planning and carrying out
of terrorist activities]{.underline}. In parallel, [there is the risk
that failing to ensure continuous IT systems may also cause disruptions
in operations]{.underline} (Jarvelainen, 2013), [and consequent
challenges for mission assurance of the enterprise]{.underline} (D. J.
Bodeau, Graubart & Fabius-Greene, 2010). Rand has estimated that the
global cost of cyber-crime can range from USS799 billion to over USS2
trillion (Dreyer et al., 2018) and, as recent examples like the Wannacry
and Petya a viruses have shown, effects include not only disruption of
industrial operations, but also lives put at risk.

[The modem [shipping]{.mark} industry thus [faces cyber-risks]{.mark}
associated with its own data and control systems, and also to its supply

the weakest link in the supply network]{.underline} (He et al., 2016),
(Khan & Sepulveda Estay, 2015). [Considering their effects and the
urgency of a problem that is continuing to unfold, it is sensible to ask
how risks derived from the use of IT systems should be managed in

protective [measures to prevent and respond to]{.mark} potential supply
chain [attacks]{.mark} in the future [while]{.mark}** **[mitigating
their impact need to be introduced]{.mark} urgently**]{.underline},\" it
said. ENISA\'s analysis found that attackers focused on the suppliers\'
code in about 66% of reported incidents. The same proportion of vendors
were not aware of the attack before it was disclosed. \"This shows that
organisations should focus their efforts on validating third-party code
and software before using them to ensure these were not tampered with or
manipulated,\" ENISA said, although this is something easier said than
done. As the Linux Foundation highlighted in the wake of the SolarWinds
disclosure, even reviewing source code -- for both open source and
unaudited proprietary software -- probably wouldn\'t have prevented that
attack. ENISA is calling for coordinated action at an EU level and has
outlined nine recommendations that customers and vendors should take.
Recommendations for customers include: identifying and documenting
suppliers and service providers; defining risk criteria for different
types of suppliers and services such as supplier and customer
dependencies, critical software dependencies, single points of failure;
monitoring of supply chain risks and threats; managing suppliers over
the whole lifecycle of a product or service, including procedures to
handle end-of-life products or components; classifying of assets and
information shared with or accessible to suppliers, and defining
relevant procedures for accessing and handling them. ENISA recommends
suppliers: ensure that the infrastructure used to design, develop,
manufacture, and deliver products, components and services follows
cybersecurity practices; implement a product development, maintenance
and support process that is consistent with commonly accepted product
development processes; monitor security vulnerabilities reported by
internal and external sources, including third-party components;
maintain an inventory of assets that includes patch-relevant
information. The SolarWinds attack for example rattled Microsoft whose
president Brad Smith said it was the \"largest and most sophisticated
attack the world has ever seen\" and that it probably took 1,000
engineers to pull off. Alleged Russian intelligence hackers compromised
SolarWinds\' software build system for Orion to plant a backdoor that
was distributed as a software to several US cybersecurity firms and
multiple federal agencies. SEE: The cybersecurity jobs crisis is getting

Cybersecurity has a prominent role in the management of business and
government activities. While it has achieved increased academic
recognition, with degrees in cybersecurity being offered at major
national universities, 79 not all agencies have developed complete
cybersecurity systems. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has
created the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), a
national risk management center for US critical infrastructure. The
cybersecurity branch notes that ["\[c\]yberspace and its underlying
infrastructure are vulnerable to a wide range of risks stemming from
both physical and cyber threats and hazards]{.underline}."80 [Palo Alto
Networks has noted that [the supply chain is the weakest link in
cybersecurity]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The cybersecurity of each
partner in the chain is controlled within its own organization so that
[one partner with weak protections exposes the rest of the partners to
hackers.]{.underline} New vulnerabilities are developing through the
"Internet of Things, digital buyer-seller relationships, and robotic
process automation," raising the need to know how you're your
"suppliers, and their suppliers' suppliers, and so on down the value
chain, have the same kind of protection."81

[Within the surface transportation element of the global supply chain,
[**there are multiple points of cyber vulnerability**. SCADA]{.mark}
systems have long been used to [manage industrial systems and power
grids]{.mark} and now operate the engines of merchant marine vessels.
**[Navigation is carried out through cyber bases systems]{.mark} using
global positioning systems**]{.underline} (GPS). **[[Cyber control of
road and railroad signals, train and ship scheduling, and bridge
operations]{.mark} offers further opportunities for hackers to
interfere]{.underline}**.82 [Damaging the navigation cyber connection
can cause a ship to go off course]{.underline} or even get lost at sea.
[**[Disruption in]{.mark} train [signals can cause]{.mark} derailments,
which can lead to [environmental damage, fires and impacts on
communities]{.mark} along the tracks**.]{.underline}

[Recent incidents have demonstrated the cybersecurity threat to maritime
transportation]{.underline}. In July 2019, the US Coast Guard assisted a
vessel bound for New York that had been subjected to a malware attack.
The ship's owners failed to provide adequate cyber protection for the
on-board computer that was used for electronic charts, cargo management,
and communication with the port, pilots and Coast Guard. They determined
that the vessel's lack of appropriate cyber protection was "exposing
critical vessel control systems to significant vulnerabilities."83 A
more serious attack occurred in December of 2019 when a ransomware
attack dubbed Ryuk shut down a port facility for 30 hours. "[The virus
further burrowed into the industrial control systems that monitor and
control cargo transfer and encrypted files critical to process
operations]{.underline}. The impacts to the facility included a
disruption of the entire corporate IT network (beyond the footprint of
the facility), disruption of camera and physical access control systems,
and loss of critical process control monitoring systems."84 A
Singapore-based cybersecurity firm warned that ransomware attacks
against ports could cost the world economy \$110 billion.85

The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation
have developed tools to educate the transportation sector about cyber
risks, and provides tools to guide the development of cybersecurity
programs. Trucking, maritime and freight rail elements are all discussed
in the Transportation Systems Sector Specific Plan, 86 but the
integration from vendor through the supply chain is not addressed.
[[Cross-sector dependencies]{.mark} with power and public safety [are
acknowledged]{.mark}, and the importance of partners and stakeholders is
discussed, [but there is no discussion]{.mark} of the weak link [outside
the transportation sector that may expose the supply chain to cyber
attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Resilience Add-Ons

### Add-On \-\-- Trade

#### Cyber attacks on infrastructure collapses trade

**[Merk 18]{.underline}** \[Olaf Merk, leads the ports and shipping work

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Lucie Kirstein and Filip
Salamitov, \"The Impact of Alliances in Container Shipping\", 11/2/18,
https://www.itf-oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/impact-alliances-container-shipping.pdf\]

In addition to alliances, **[vertical integration]{.underline}**
[risks]{.underline} also **[reduce system resilience]{.underline}**.
[[Integration]{.mark} of shipping, terminal handling and hinterland
transport could mean that whole transport chains are in the hand of just
a few players, [creating **huge leverage for
cyber-attacks**]{.mark},]{.underline} especially if parts of the chain
are digitally connected. This [became [painfully evident]{.mark}
[during]{.mark} the [NotPetya]{.mark} attack that hit Maersk ships and
terminals]{.underline} (Box 7). [Vertical integration could be
considered to be [related to]{.mark} the emergence of
[alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}. As service differentiation for the
sea-leg is difficult in alliances -- as the product is basically the
same -- one of the few remaining possibilities for individual carriers
to differentiate is via vertical integration.

Box 7. Cyber security and risks associated to vertical integration

On 27 June 2017, a major cyber-attack began hitting firms mainly in
France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. The attack is suspected to have started when hackers
compromised the update server of Ukrainian tax accounting software
company M.E.Doc so that it would distribute a malware referred to as
"NotPetya" throughout its network. The malware further propagated itself
notably via an exploit using a vulnerable Microsoft Windows network
protocol. After analysis of the encryption routine of the malware,
experts from Kaspersky came to the conclusion that the attack, although
appearing as a ransomware attack, did not allow victims to recover their
data even after paying the ransom, and the aim was therefore suspected
to be directed at major disruption instead of financial gain for hackers
(Ivanov and Mamedov, 2017). The [carrier Maersk was presumably
contaminated by this malware via software used by one of its offices in
Ukraine. [Maersk]{.mark} was forced to **[shut down]{.mark} many of its
[operating systems]{.mark}** to stop the attack from
spreading]{.underline}. The [company was unable to process new orders
and **cranes were operated manually** at some of its 76 container
ports]{.underline}. The [disruption [caused **major delays**]{.mark} and
led to rerouting of several vessels to ports not, or less,
affected]{.underline} (Odell et al./FT, 2017). [[At least 17
terminals]{.mark} operated by APMT got [infected]{.mark} by Maersk's
central IT infrastructure]{.underline} (Reuters, 2017). A number of
[terminals were unable to identify which shipment belonged to whom and
therefore needed to clear cargo manually]{.underline}. The largest
Indian port JNPT operated by Maersk's APMT was forced to shut down and
the terminal Maasvlakte II in Rotterdam stopped operations completely
for a full week, which led to a highly congested service level.

According to Maersk's annual report for 2017, the attack mainly impacted
Maersk Line, APM Terminals and Damco. The [effect on profitability was
estimated to be around USD 250-300 million, with the vast majority of
the impact related to Maersk Line in the third quarter]{.underline}
(Maersk, 2018). [Maersk [estimated a 20% drop in volume]{.mark} and lost
out on carrying 70 000 40-foot containers within the two weeks of the
attack. Besides lost revenue, the attack also involved [**high costs**
of **rebuilding**]{.mark} **its [IT
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the moment of the
cyber-attack, Maersk did not own any cyber risk insurance. The company
reported that 4 000 new servers, 45 000 new PCs, and 2 500 applications
had to be reinstalled (Chirgwin/The Register, 2018). Actual impacts on
Maersk's performance could be higher than reported and probably stretch
beyond the second half of 2017 (Porter/Lloyd's List, 2017a). In April
2018, [analysts speculated that the attack could have cost Maersk group
over USD 500 million in expenses and lost profit]{.underline}. Others
situate the cost between USD 400-500 million because the effect from the
attack continued in the fourth quarter of 2017 and led Maersk to make
investments in new infrastructure and insurances. Furthermore, [the
cyber-attack could have had an extended impact on market shares until
the first quarter of 2018]{.underline} (Beck/ShippingWatch, 2018).
Although for most affected terminals it took a few days before they
could resume operations completely, [shippers were affected by **delays
of up to two months**]{.underline}, because [Maersk reportedly had
difficulties in allocating new slots and tracking and assigning correct
data to containers.]{.underline} The impact was widely felt by
interviewed shippers and Lloyd's List reported a similar observation
that [nearly two months after the attack, Maersk was still dealing with
containers in transit at the time of the attack]{.underline}
(Porter/Lloyd's List, 2017b). One of the [interviewed shippers reports
having received additional demurrage invoices due to complications and
delays caused by the cyber-attack, which suggests the carrier might have
tried to shift part of the costs of the attack to their
consumer]{.underline}s.

**[Maersk's [global coverage]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as well as [[strong
horizontal and vertical integration]{.mark} in the sector **[further
facilitated the knock-on effect]{.mark}** of the
cyber-attack]{.underline}. [[Companies]{.mark} who are [reliant]{.mark}
up[on]{.mark} [common IT]{.mark} infrastructure will logically [suffer
business interruption simultaneously]{.mark} when that infrastructure is
compromised]{.underline}. Since [[supply chains]{.mark} are [highly
interconnected]{.mark} and even more so with increasing automation and
digitalisation, this can [result in an **insecure operating
environment**]{.mark} even for those firms that make cyber security a
priority]{.underline}. However, [there is not only interdependence in IT
infrastructure, but also in the **[utilisation of common
assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to SeaIntel analysis, [20 other
carriers transported containers on-board Maersk vessels around the time
of the cyber-attack]{.underline} (SeaIntel, 2017; 319). MSC was the most
affected with 23 vessel sharing agreements and four slot-charters,
followed by Safmarine and Hamburg Süd. The most affected outside the 2M
alliance and Maersk ownership was CMA CGM, with six vessel sharing
agreements and four slot charter agreements with Maersk. The
[[shipping]{.mark} sector is the [**backbone** of **international trade
and ports**]{.mark} are a [**vital part** of every country's
**infrastructure**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Any **[major disruptions in
supply chains]{.mark}** can therefore [have impacts on the **overall
economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [scale of the [cyber-attack]{.mark}
and the many interconnections that exist vertically and horizontally in
this industry could transform the collateral and rather accidental
damage on a firm that was presumably not directly targeted, into [a
**systemic risk for global trade**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Ext \-\-- Info Sharing K2 Attribution

#### Info sharing is key to proper attribution \-\-- solves false flags

The challenges related to false flags have been investigated before
(Pihelgas 2015). Especially (Bartholomew and Guerrero-Saade 2016) takes
a closer look into the problem and also surveys noteworthy actors in the
field. [Cyber [Info]{.mark}rmation [sharing]{.mark}]{.underline} (Skopik
et al. 2016; Wagner et al. 2016) [[is a common means to gather]{.mark}
important [data to **aid**]{.mark} **the [attribution]{.mark}
process**]{.underline}, for instance, [information on attackers, their
capabilities, used TTPs and so on.]{.underline}

It is important to note that attack detection is very much different
from attribution, in that sense that not all sources (Zimmermann 2014;
MITRE 2019) relevant to detect attacks (Caltagirone et al. 2013) are
also appropriate for attribution. [In contrast to pure detection of
attacks, [attribution sets its focus to relating actions to
actors]{.mark}. A particularly important piece are therefore actor
profiles]{.underline} (Chiesa et al. 2008) used to correlate identified
actions to known capabilities and applied tactics and techniques of
actor groups. [[The main problem of the attribution is a potential
**misattribution**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Since the perpetrator attempt
to cover up their tracks [through]{.mark} a mixture of [evasiveness,
deception,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} destruction of records or though [false
flags]{.mark}.]{.underline} This issue is well known among agencies and
secret services. The NSA and NCSC released for instance a joint advisory
APT group to avoid possible misattribution Footnote1. The [[information
sharing]{.underline}, **[especially threat intelligence]{.underline}**,
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one **[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}** aspect
[[to detect **false falgs**]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are some
initiatives worldwide, such as the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act
in the USA Footnote2, Cyber Security Information Sharing of ENISA
Footnote3, or Cyber Information Exchange in the NATO Footnote4. The
[NATO]{.underline} Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence
[is]{.underline} also [aware of the issue]{.underline} and developed own
definitions for false-flag, no-flag cyber operations (Pihelgas 2015) and
influence cyber operations (Brangetto and Veenendaal 2016). Influence
cyber operations are designed to influence the behaviour of a target
audience. [These [false flag]{.mark} operations [are part of]{.mark} the
**[hybrid threats]{.mark} today**]{.underline}, such as Russian
aggression against Ukraine in 2014 and its intervention in Syria in
2015. One of the latest false flag operation is the TV5Hack (see
"Illustrative application of CAM to identify false flags" section).

In February 2010, former NSA Director Mike McConnell wrote that, "[[We
need to develop an earlywarning system to monitor
cyberspace]{.underline}, [identify intrusions and locate the source of
attacks]{.underline}]{.mark} [with a trail of evidence that can support
diplomatic, military and legal options---and we must be able to do this
in **milliseconds**]{.underline}. More specifically, we need to
reengineer the Internet to make attribution, geolocation, intelligence
analysis and impact assessment---who did it, from where, why and what
was the result---more manageable."2

[[This statement is part of a recurring theme that a secure Internet
must provide **better attribution**]{.underline}]{.mark} for actions
occurring on the network. Although attribution generally means assigning
a cause to an action, this meaning refers to identifying the agent
responsible for the action (specifically, "determining the identity or
location of an attacker or an attacker's intermediary"3). This links the
word to the more general idea of identity, in its various meanings.
[[Attribution is **central to deterrence**]{.underline}, [the idea that
one can dissuade attackers from acting through fear
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [some sort of [retaliation. Retaliation requires
knowing]{.mark} with full certainty [who the attackers

island on its own when it comes to cyber threats and vulnerabilities.
[The EU can do a lot in areas that are relevant for NATO, such as
cybersecurity certification of devices imported into and used in

become a critical national security concern]{.underline}, as illustrated

15\. However, in recent years, [[governments]{.mark}, private companies,

forensics expert to trace the origin]{.underline} of the attack
(Lindsay, 2015). Indeed, [[governments within the Alliance and beyond
are **increasingly attributing malicious cyber incidents**]{.mark} to
states and their proxies. Such transparency on cyber incidents is
increasingly collective, coordinated in policy and time, and independent
of the scale, nature, or impact of the incident]{.underline} (Giles and
Hartmann, 2019). The Rapporteur supports this emerging policy of naming
and shaming perpetrators and encourages further conversations at the
NATO level.

16\. [Even if states and their proxies could be confident they will
remain anonymous, [truly convincing strategic rationales for large-scale
surprise attacks are lacking. Anonymous cyber attacks are not
well-suited for coercion]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} for example.
Coercion only works if the attacked entity knows whom to yield or make
concessions to. As one analyst points out succinctly, "\[p\]urely
anonymous coercion is almost impossible because communicating and
understanding the power to hurt implies that there is someone doing the
hurting and a target concerned about avoiding getting hurt" (Lindsay,
2015). As a result, [if an opponent wishes to coerce through cyber
attacks, he cannot hide himself]{.underline}. This would defeat the
purpose. How can the victim give in to demands if it does not know who
the attacker is? (In contrast, cyber criminals want to stay anonymous
when, for example, they attempt to extort money from victims.)

[Attribution is not the same as punishment]{.underline}. It might be if
the attacker really cares about a reputation for integrity: concerns
about plausible deniability in covert action often turn on executive
worries about blowback from domestic constituents, political rivals, and
friendly allies as much as sanctioning by the victim. However, [since
retaliation can be costly]{.underline} for the one administering the
punishment as well as the punished, [a victim may decide **not to do
anything**]{.underline} [even after attribution if the costs and risks
of punishing are too great. China conducts pervasive cyber
espionage]{.underline} against Western interests, and there is good
evidence available publicly [and]{.underline} in [US intelligence
circles that the Chinese state is responsible, but so far naming and
shaming actions have had little effect. The USA has had no stomach for
more serious sanctions]{.underline} thus far, even as it routinely
attributes Chinese (or Russian or Iranian) intrusions.

Furthermore, **[attribution is not required for
punishment]{.underline}**. A minefield, if advertised, protects an area
from intruders whether they are known to the defender or not, since the
trespasser selects a very specific punishment by the act of stepping on
a mine. Defensive deception similarly turns the attacker's ability to
penetrate a system against the attacker, by enabling the intruder's
effort to trigger his own punishment or simply creating paranoia that he
may have done so \[ 16 \]. [States]{.underline} often [punish whole
villages or classes of people when individual guerrillas cannot be
brought to justice. This is not only unpopular but also expensive
because a lot more force must be expended over a larger
area.]{.underline} **[Indiscriminate punishment]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} usually a [less effective deterrent]{.underline} or
warfighting instrument in civil war than targeting killing \[ 72 \],
[and may even counterproductively]{.underline} embolden insurgents,
**[but it certainly does not depend on attribution]{.underline}**.
Likewise, [a victim of cyber attack who wanted to punish some attackers
could cease digital transactions with all trading partners or start
attacking all suspects.]{.underline} Doing so, however, would quickly
undermine the benefits that made internet exchange worthwhile in the
first place and would be very unpopular. Inflicting even small
punishments on a large number of suspects can be difficult to execute
(so to speak) as well as politically illegitimate.

In cases of cyber operations below the threshold of an armed attack,
[[Article 4]{.mark}]{.underline} of the Washington Treaty [[calls
on]{.mark} the [NATO]{.mark} members [to 'consult together' if]{.mark}
the]{.underline} 'territorial integrity, political independence or
[[security]{.mark} of any of the Parties [is
threatened']{.mark}]{.underline}. 47 [[Here]{.underline}]{.mark} as
well, **[[attribution is important]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The process
of consu[ltation includes exchanging information]{.mark} and
opinions]{.underline}, 48 and might also be used to discuss the
attribution of the act to a state prior to launching a collaborative
NATO operation. [[Article 4 thus]{.underline}]{.mark} likewise
[[enables]{.mark} the [sharing of intelligence]{.mark}]{.underline}
especially [in the context of cyber attribution]{.underline}.49 At least
once, NATO has arguably already joined a collective attribution
initiated by the Dutch and British governments in the cyber context,
condemning the Russian hacking activities against the Organisation for
the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in 2018.50 There is, however, no
public information available whether NATO resorted to Article 4 in this
context, nor whether it considered adhering to any evidentiary standards
for attributing the act to Russia.

[The [consultation]{.mark} process [can]{.mark}]{.underline}, in some
circumstances, [[lead to]{.mark} a [joint decision]{.mark} or
action,]{.underline} 51 [which may include condemning acts of the
wrongful state]{.underline} (after having attributed the activity
successfully). [**[It is clear]{.mark}**, however, [that this would have
to happen **in consensus** with **all NATO allies**, which could require
that]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [especially [in the context of
attribution]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- **[all NATO members are equally
equipped]{.underline}**]{.mark} with the necessary information and
capacities [to make a profound decision. To build this community of
trust where NATO members can share information without
hesitation]{.underline}, the NATO Cyber Defence Pledge was adopted at
the Warsaw Summit in 2016, where [member states pledged to invest in the
improvement of their national cyber defence capabilities]{.underline}.
According to the NATO website, 'almost all Allies have upgraded their
cyber defences' since adopting the Pledge.52 [Measures such as these
further facilitate]{.underline} [intelligence sharing between states, as
states with a higher level of security will trust other 'more cyber
capable Allies' more than those with less secure cyber defense
mechanisms]{.underline}. 53

NATO is also cooperating with regional organisations, such as the EU, on
questions regarding better intelligence-sharing to counter cyber
threats. In a Joint Declaration in 2016, the EU and [[NATO noted the
'urgent need to: Boost]{.mark} \[the]{.underline} EU's and NATO's\]
[[ability to counter hybrid threats, including]{.mark} by]{.underline}
bolstering resilience, [[working together on analysis,]{.mark}
prevention, and early detection, through timely information sharing and,
to the extent possible, intelligence sharing]{.underline} between
staffs; and cooperating on strategic communication and response.' 54
Also, amongst other initiatives, the EU Computer Emergency Response Team
and the NATO Computer Incident Response Capability have concluded a
'Technical Arrangement on Cyber Defence' in 2016, providing a framework
where both sides can better exchange information and share best
practices on cyber defence.55

In sum, [[NATO has realised that there is a need to increase its
capacities to become an effective platform]{.mark} of assistance and
cooperation for its members to counter cyber threats (which also
includes attribution]{.underline}). [Measures such as the Cyber Defense
Pledge]{.underline} or cooperation agreements with other organisations
seem to [help with capacity-building and better
cooperation]{.underline}. **[However]{.underline}**, [[it is evident
that an **institutionalised system**]{.underline}]{.mark} comparable to
the EU's 'Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox' **[[does not

To summarise, [[there is potential within]{.mark} the]{.underline} EU's

[[NATO]{.mark}']{.underline}s [alliance]{.underline} and the US Cyber

attribution]{.mark} by one state [and increase the political pressure on
the]{.mark} alleged [wrongful state, which might
even]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [[deter future 'malicious' cyber
incidents]{.mark}. However, **[the biggest issue for collective
attribution]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[seems to be a **lack of

[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, **[[hinders]{.mark} them to take

will]{.mark} most likely [be **reluctant to support attribution
claims**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Closely interlinked with this is the
question whether common evidentiary standards might be helpful to solve
this problem. In any event, states will tend to refuse to attribute if
doing so could potentially harm their international relations with the
alleged wrongful state. [The lack of technical expertise and insecure
cyber defence systems]{.underline} within some states [compared to other
technologically well-equipped states does not help with building trust
either. [Hence why capacity-building is crucial]{.mark}, also for a
collective attribution effort]{.underline}. To conclude, although there
seems to be potential within the above-mentioned mechanisms, it is
questionable whether states will make use of them or remain fairly
reluctant to attribute.

America's [[deprioritization of allies creates **opportunities** for
revisionist powers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such transition is recurrent in
geopolitics; **[i]{.underline}**nternational **[r]{.underline}**elations
[are always characterized by **uncertainty**]{.underline}. Policy makers
have to navigate a landscape that is often difficult to delineate, full
of strategic actors whose purposes are often obscure and whose power is
difficult to assess. [**Intentions** are notoriously hard to
divine]{.underline}, in part because rival states obfuscate them but in
part because often the states themselves do not have a clear and
consistent perception of what they want to achieve. [**Uncertainty**
arises]{.underline} also out of a more quantifiable source of knowledge,
an assessment of hard power, which is imperfect and results in widely
different estimates. It is sufficient to recall the challenges of
assessing Soviet power throughout the Cold War.

Moments characterized by alleged **[large shifts]{.underline}** in
relative power [present particularly **acute problems** of assessing
**power** and **intent**ions, adding an additional **layer** of
**ambiguity** and **uncertainty**. **Rumors** of change put in doubt the
relatively]{.underline} well- known, or at least [familiar, geopolitical
situation]{.underline}. All parties involved are unsure about their
position relative to the others, the extent of their political sway, and
the match between their commitments and their power. The [established
great powers may have a **crisis of confidence**]{.underline}, while
emboldened rising states are uncertain how far their influence extends
as well as how solid and credible is the power reach of their weakening
rival. Revisionist powers now openly but cautiously question what was
the grudgingly accepted geopolitical status quo.

Rising powers are thus curious but careful. They are interested in
pushing the existing boundaries of their influence but do not know how
far they can do so without meeting a firm opposition of the other power.
In the current case, U.S. rivals--- [[China, Russia, and Iran]{.mark}---
appear keen to assert their influence]{.underline} and establish what
they deem their rightful position in their respective regions and in the
world but are also eager to avoid a direct confrontation with the United
States. [Uncertain]{.underline} about their own power relative to the
United States, [they **[test]{.mark} the hypothesis** of]{.underline} a
[growing [American]{.mark}]{.underline} economic and [military
[fragility]{.mark} and decaying political reach]{.underline}. To figure
out the new map of power, and possibly to redraw it at low cost,
[revisionist powers engage [in **probing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In this chapter we examine this behavior--- the probing by revisionist
powers. We define probing as a low- intensity and low- risk test aimed
at gauging the opposing state's power and will to maintain security and
influence over a region. It is a set of actions that studiously avoids a
direct military confrontation with the leading power by targeting the
outer limits of its commitments and interests. There, along the outer
rim of its influence, the hegemon is at the furthest of its commitments
and power projection. The perception, or rather the suspicion, of its
decline is most consequential along these frontiers of power because the
revisionist state senses opportunities in its own neighborhood and
searches for confirmation of the rival's weakness. Probing is an
opportunistic behavior. It occurs when the revisionist states detect a
permissive international situation, namely, when they think that the
existing great power is retreating. It is still a behavior that is
characterized by self- doubt and uncertainty, although if unanswered it
results in the confirmation of the belief in the rival's decline and may
lead to ever more assertive challenges to the international order and
expansions of influence by the geopolitical challenger. Over the past
few years, and with greater frequency and brazenness, regional powers
opposed to the United States have been engaging in probing. Russia,
Iran, and China in their respective regions have been working under the
hypothesis that the United States is retreating, out of choice, fatigue,
or weakness, or all three combined. The American retrenchment is more
pronounced in the Middle East, with the ending of U.S. combat presence
in Iraq and the drawdown in Afghanistan as well as the unwillingness to
intervene in Syria, leaving a vacuum for Iranian influence. But there is
an equally pervasive perception of American withdrawal or decline in the
other two key regions, Europe and Asia. In Europe, the perception is
that Washington is redirecting its strategic focus and resources toward
Asia and has limited willpower to back its extended deterrent, giving
Moscow a window of opportunity to redraw the map in Europe's eastern
"borderlands. " And in Asia, a rising and confident China looks at a
United States hobbled by financial crises, fiscal imbalances, and a
decade- long military overstretch in the Middle East. The reasons are
different, but the broad perception is similar: the revisionist states
sense an opening left by a distracted and weakening United States. And
they probe along the periphery of American influence, from Ukraine to
the South China Sea through the Persian Gulf. ORIGINS OF PROBING
BEHAVIOR Probing stems out of a tentative belief that the existing
geopolitical order is amenable to change, and it seeks to confirm this
suspicion. A perceived geopolitical change remains only that, perceived,
until facts on the ground confirm it. An assessment of a state's power
is merely an estimate of how that state may fare in a clash with others.
As such, it informs a set of expectations for the future, and it may or
may not reflect reality. Often there is little agreement among powers as
well as within those powers as to which assessment of power is correct.1
Today, for instance, questions about the continued resilience of
American power abound both abroad and in the United States, and there
are analysts on both sides of the argument.2 Regardless of where one
stands on the issue of American relative decline or retrenchment, the
mere existence of such a debate is a source of concern because it points
to an absence of clarity on the geopolitical scene. The various
strategic actors no longer know where they stand on the international
pecking order and are confused as to how far their own influence can
reach and what the responses of their rivals may be.3 These are periods
of a tense peace but also of great uncertainty about the nature of the
security environment. As a scholar put it, it is the "fog of peace" that
makes strategic planning more difficult because it is unclear who the
enemy is, how much power a potential rival may have, and where the
boundaries of political influence are.4 As history indicates, often such
an uncertain strategic environment degenerates into war, which is a
"dispute about the measurement of power. "5 The outcome of a war is the
violent clarification of such confusion. It settles the dispute about
the assessment of power. A victory or defeat in war, followed by changes
in boundaries, military bases, or political affiliations of governments,
is one way to prove or disprove a perceived alteration in relative
power. As British historian A.J.P. Taylor observed, the "test of a Great
Power is . . . the test of strength for war. "6 After its defeat in the
1853-- 1856 Crimean War, Russia was clearly militarily inferior to
European states (even though the victorious powers, Britain, France,
Turkey, and later Austria, also encountered serious difficulties in
projecting power to the Black Sea theater) and consciously chose to
retreat, reform, and rebuild its foundations of power, known as a policy
of recueillement, in order to maintain its status as a European great
power.7 There is no clearer confirmation of a state's decline than a
loss in a direct confrontation with a rising power; there is equally no
better proof that the perception of relative decline was incorrect when
the aspirant revisionist state is soundly defeated. In the immediate
aftermath of a war it is therefore easier to assess one's own power
relative to that of the other players. War lifts the "fog of peace. "
But war is rarely pursued simply to clarify one's own uncertain standing
relative to the other strategic actors. To engage in war, the ultimate
test of power, is exceedingly dangerous, and no leader wants to enter
into a violent conflict simply as a way of assessing the power of its
own state relative to the target. Wars are realms of luck and un knowns
as much as of more calculable kinetic clashes, and consequently the
outcomes do not always align with the expectations preceding them.8 In
fact, the losing party in a conflict has often entered that war having
overestimated its own capability relative to the rival. Many in Europe,
for instance, expected in summer 1914 to be "home for Christmas, " only
to remain in the bloody trenches for several years. Given this inherent
uncertainty, the risk of being proven wrong for both the perceived
rising and declining powers is high, and great powers in history seem to
stumble into wars rather than consciously pursue them as tests of
strength. The risks of war are incalculable and thus extremely high. A
less risky way of assessing a changing equilibrium of power is through
probing. This is a form of strategic behavior meant to test existing
perceptions of power relations, seeking at the same time to draw the
presumably new boundaries of influence. The rising or revisionist state,
in particular, is strongly motivated to test the will of its seemingly
declining rival power. It has the aspiration, mitigated by the fear of
the rival great power, to alter the existing geopolitical map. Such
states, unhappy with the existing international order, which they
perceive perhaps as imposed on them and certainly as increasingly not
reflective of their own rising aspirations and power, have the most to
gain from probing. If this behavior confirms the perception that the
existing great power is on the wane and that the map drawn by it is no
longer supported by its strength and will, the revisionist state may be
able to reassert lost influence over its neighborhood and revise a
previous settlement. At the same time, such a state has also a strong
incentive to avoid a direct clash with its main antagonist lest the
perception of its relative weakening turns out not to match reality. A
strategy of direct confrontation is risky because its success is
predicated on the relative weakness of the targeted power, the existing
hegemon, and this is exactly what is unknown. If the probing power
becomes convinced that its hypothesis of its own superiority (and of the
relative decline of the rival) is true, then a direct clash may occur.
But until that confirmation, a safer, less risky course of action is to
engage in a probing behavior, akin to testing the water before jumping
in. Probes target the frontier of the rival power's influence, where its
interests are less pronounced, its power is at its farthest projection,
and its political clout at its weakest. At these outer edges the
response of the great power is expected to be most restrained, while the
gains of the probing state are most likely to occur. The purpose of
probing, therefore, is to gauge the resolve of the targeted powers. We
will return to this later, but here it is important to note that a
probing action is also a way of showing the renewed or freshly acquired
capabilities and aspirations that otherwise would remain latent and
without tangible effects. One cannot revise an established order by
keeping one's own intentions and capabilities hidden. Showing a new
military platform, often in a carefully choreographed event, is one way
of signaling growing power. The 1907-- 1909 voyage of the American
"Great White Fleet, " meant to showcase the emergent global naval
strength of the United States, was one such episode. The round- the-
globe cruise was not targeted at a specific power and did not aim to
extend American influence over a particular state or region. Rather, it
was a broad assertion of American capabilities and global reach, and the
other powers, Great Britain in particular, certainly received it as a
sign that the United States was a power to be reckoned with. But probing
is more than showing off. It is not simply an action of strutting on the
world stage with newly acquired military gadgets and political
confidence but a precisely targeted action with clear objectives.
Through probing, a revisionist state aims at changing the existing
geopolitical order where it thinks it can, namely, at the farthest
points of the ruling great power's influence. Probing, therefore, is not
just mere signaling of displeasure with the rules of the international
order and the map of power; it aims to revise the order gradually and
carefully, starting from the outer layers of the rival great power's
influence. FEATURES OF PROBING The purpose of probing is threefold.
First, a probing state aims to check whether the rumors of its rival's
weakening are true. A probe is a test, meant to elicit a response from
the targeted power. Second, the revisionist state that engages in
probing behavior wants to avoid a direct military clash with the
existing great power. The risks of being wrong about the rival's resolve
and capability are simply too big. Third, the state's objective is to
achieve, if possible, low- cost revision of the existing regional order.
These purposes can be seen in the features that characterize a probe and
distinguish it from other types of behavior, ranging from fullout
aggression to commercial pressures and diplomatic démarches. First,
probes are low intensity, vigilantly avoiding a direct war with the main
rival power. They are below the horizon of direct military
confrontation. The revisionist state has no interest in starting an
allout military conflict with the rival great power, perhaps declining
but still more than a match. The level of violence used, therefore, is
low, and probes are limited projections of power in areas of less
pronounced interest to the rival. A probing power engages in a lot of
selfrestraint; it intentionally elects to keep the use of force at a
minimum. It can but chooses not to escalate. A probe is a calculated
gamble, not a foolish thrashing around. The desire to avoid a war with
the existing hegemon often leads the revisionist to project power under
cover of civilian or paramilitary forces, part of a larger trend of
"civilianization" of conflict.9 By using unmarked units to harass a U.S.
protégé, a state is able to de ny authorship of provocative actions and
thereby avoid a more violent and direct war while at the same time
chipping away at the rival's influence and wealth. The possibility of
denying that an aggression has occurred drives costs of revisionism
lower. For instance, the sixteenth- century privateer Sir Francis Drake
acted on behalf of Queen Elizabeth I, raiding Spanish shipping but never
in an official capacity. The queen went so far as to tell a Spanish
ambassador that "Drake was a private adventurer, and that she had
nothing to object to his alleged execution. " She was careful in not
provoking Spain too much but eager to "singe the King of Spain's beard.
"10 A similar approach can be seen around the world today. The initial
Russian push into Crimea in 2014 was done anonymously with unmarked
special forces, dubbed by Ukrainians as the "little green men, " a clear
example of a long- standing Russian practice of tactical deception and
disguise (maksirovka).11 It was an indication that Moscow was unsure
whether Ukrainian forces would react, and, in the event of a determined
opposition, it maintained the option of either escalating with larger
conventional forces or halting operations and denying. Moscow seemed to
be more careful in masking the identity of its forces in eastern
Ukraine, where the local opposition was more assertive and the Western
displeasure with Russian aggression more pronounced. The greater the
risk of a strong response from the actors targeted, the more carefully
tailored, dissimulated, and low- intensity is the probe. The use of
unmarked troops and paramilitary forces allows Russia to claim that no
aggression has occurred, and thus no military response from Ukraine or
from the West is warranted. China has been testing the limits of the
influence of the United States and its allies in the South China Sea
using an array of civilianlooking vessels. Its fishing fleet, combined
with a fishery- enforcement fleet, is integrated into its military
institutions and plays an active role in expanding China's maritime
reach. As Lyle Goldstein observes, this is part of a "strategy of
'defeating harshness with kindness' (yi rou ke gang)" whereby China
deploys "unarmed fishing vessels or fisheries enforcement vessels to
confront foreign vessels operating in its EEZ and claimed waters. "12
This low- intensity push tests the fron tier of American influence in a
way that makes a U.S. response difficult.13 A foray by a Chinese naval
vessel into contested waters can be countered with the might of the
United States and its ally's navy; a probe by fishing vessels manned by
Chinese fishermen does not warrant the involvement of the U.S. Seventh
Fleet. This is risky behavior, but it also indicates a desire by China
to avoid a war with the other regional powers as well as with the United
States.14 If it is openly a military attack, a probe is conducted with a
strong and perhaps warranted belief that the rival power will not
intervene because it is distracted elsewhere and because it deems the
targeted region to be of little immediate interest. This was the case of
the Russian war with Georgia in 2008, when Moscow felt emboldened by
NATO ambivalence to extending its membership process to Tbilisi and by
the American strategic distraction by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
(where a small Georgian contingent was deployed). The Russian gamble was
based on the expectation of no meaningful Western, and American in
particular, response. The objective was to chip away at the unwelcome
Western influence in Russia's neighborhood but without spurring an
equally unwelcome Western military reply--- to "singe America's beard, "
as it were. Second, a revisionist state engages in probing because it
sees it as a low- risk but high- reward behavior. The low risk stems in
part from the first feature, the carefully tailored level of
aggressiveness that is expected not to elicit a full- out military
response by the rival. It is also related to the third feature,
explained below, namely, the fact that the immediate target of probing
is geographically and political peripheral to the interests of the rival
great power, and consequently contributes to the low likelihood of a
forceful military response. But on top of being pursued as a low- risk
action, a probe can yield high strategic rewards. Most often the
revisionist power seems to direct probing behavior to its immediate
vicinity, hoping to expand its influence over neighboring and thus more
controllable regions.15 It is there that it has the greatest chances of
extending its own political shadow successfully. Probes are rarely long-
distance projections of power because incursions deep into the rival's
sphere of influence are more liable to be met with more assertive
responses as well as being less likely to establish durable control by
the probing state. The farther the revisionist state engages in probing
behavior, the more high risk and low reward it is, and vice versa. Hence
the more likely locations for probing behavior are in the near
neighborhood of the revisionist power. Furthermore, probes focus on
strategically important regions, either resource rich or located along
lines of communication, or both. Elizabethan England, for example,
conducted raiding probes of Spain's vulnerable transatlantic arteries
bringing gold from the New World--- not its stronger positions in the
Mediterranean. Imperial Germany's probes of the Anglo- French alliance
targeted Morocco, located near the strategically important choke point
of Gibraltar but beyond easy reach of the main British fleet. Today
China's probes of U.S. allies in Asia often target oil and gas fields in
the South China Sea. In all these cases, since the goal of probing is to
test the power and commitment of a rival state, it has to be directed at
regions where the rival's influence is present but not preponderant. It
is unlikely that regions of no geostrategic value or with few resources
have much of a presence of the rival great power, and as such they are
not prime material for probing. A state may still have imperial
aspirations in such regions, but not every extension of power is a
probe. Probing is not simply grabbing new areas of influence but first
and foremost to test the will of the rival. There may be, of course, the
bonus that if the probe is successful, it may result in the addition of
strategically important regions. The third feature of probing is that it
is peripheral or indirect. The target of the probe is the periphery or
the frontier of the tested power where the rival's presence is at its
farthest reach, its interests are less pronounced, and thus its response
is expected to be muted. Fearful of a militarily assertive response, the
state that is probing is careful not to target areas that are clearly
considered of primary and existential interests, such as the rival's
homeland or its immediate neighbors. Hence the visits of Russian or
Iranian naval vessels to Venezuelan ports are less a probe per se than
an act of grandstanding, since all sides know that the United States
could quickly bring overwhelming force to bear in the event of a crisis.
These are temporary publicity stunts rather than a calculated attempt to
test the hegemon's commitment to maintaining the status quo. Probes test
for perceived weaknesses, not strengths, and it is on the outer
boundaries of the existing great power that its influence is likely to
appear the most fragile. The revisionist power is interested in probing
the power and influence of its rival in places where that influence is
at its weakest, overstretched, and uncertain. During the Peloponnesian
War the Spartan general Brasidas adopted such a peripheral strategy, but
only a decade into the conflict. The initial Spartan approach of annual
invasion of Attica, Athens's immediate neighborhood, failed to inflict
sufficient damage to end the war. It was only with Brasidas, sent north
with a small force of helots (minimizing thus the risk to Spartan
manpower), that Sparta changed its strategy to one similar to probing,
by persuading or forcing distant Athenian allies in Thrace to switch
sides. And many did reconsider their allegiance to Athens, because, as
Thucydides observes, there did not seem to be much risk given the
distance from Athens and their belief that this empire was on the
wane.16 Striking the rival's periphery, and its allies, not only was
cheaper than assaulting it directly but also forced it to devote a lot
of resources to reasserting the lost influence. Global powers in
particular have a "periphery or frontier problem" that invites probing.
A lengthy frontier, distant from the homeland and thus from key
logistical bases, is difficult to protect. The sheer amount of power
needed to outfit the distant outposts, combined with the uncertainty as
to the location and timing of potential attacks, makes it impossible to
have an impermeable frontier. When a power assesses threats, the key
questions of "where, when, and by whom" are directly related to the
length of the imperial frontier. A regional power has well- delimited
borders and a clear idea of who the rival is. For instance, from the
final decade of the nineteenth century on, Germany was burdened with the
possibility of a two- front war, with France on one side and Russia on
the other; a serious problem of military planning caused by poor
diplomacy but not a source of strategic confusion. For a global power,
it is that strategic clarity that is missing, resulting in the need to
prepare for multiple contingencies and ultimately to stretch resources
in several theaters of potential action.17 While imperial Germany could
concentrate on its two- front problem, Great Britain at the turn of the
twentieth century had to consider threats from Russia (in Central Asia,
pushing toward India), Japan (in the Asian littoral sphere), France (in
Africa as well as the Mediterranean), and Germany (in Europe and the
North Sea in particular). Through deft diplomacy, it managed to
neutralize the first three, allowing it to focus on the German naval
threat, thereby limiting its "frontier problem. " In practice, probing
the periphery of a rival's great power often translates into testing the
strength of its alliances. Most great powers, or empires, expand their
influence in informal ways, through political arrangements with local
elites and formal alliances.18 The security of these great powers, in
particular of ones with global reach, therefore resides not only in the
safety of their borders but in their ability to hold rivals at a
distance and thwart their challenges to faraway interests. They do so
only in part through their own forces and rely heavily on the presence
of allies that provide additional military strength and local deterrence
(see chapter 5). Allies are at the periphery of influence and strength
of great powers, and it is there that the powers' commitment and
influence are at their weakest. It is clear that a state will respond to
an encroachment on its territorial possessions or to an attack against
its forward deployed forces. It is less certain, however, that a state
will respond in the same strong fashion to similar actions directed
against its allies and their interests. The security guarantee extended
to them, the foundation of the alliance, is a promissory note that
carries a high degree of uncertainty. Placing bases with troops on the
territory of an ally is a time- tested way of diminishing this
uncertainty. As Thomas Schelling put it, the role of U.S. troops in
South Korea was simply to die, buttressing the American security
guarantee to its ally.19 The loss of American soldiers to an initial
attack by the enemy would, so the argument goes, create powerful
pressures for Washington to respond. French general Ferdinand Foch, when
asked before World War I how many British troops would be needed for the
security of France, replied, "One single private soldier . . . and we
would take good care that he was killed. "20 Probes by the revisionist
power are not attacks against these bases and forces that underwrite the
credibility of the extended deterrent. Rather, they target areas that
may be of great importance to the ally but not necessarily to the
security patron. That is the periphery of the periphery, so to speak,
the tip of the great power's commitment. The United States has a
particularly pronounced "periphery" problem. There are few direct
threats to the continental United States, short of a large- scale
assault with weapons of mass destruction or the tragic yet relatively
small and isolated terrorist attack. While the absence of a contiguous
threat is a geopolitical blessing, it also means that most of the
menaces to U.S. interests and security are outside of the North American
continent. Hence, in the competitive international environment, "the
strategic position of the United States rests ultimately on its ability
to project power over great distances. "21 In practice this entails
managing alliances that maintain stability and keep U.S. rivals on the
defensive in key regions of the world, in particular along an arc from
Europe to East Asia through the Middle East. And historically this has
been, and continues to be, achieved by extending U.S. deterrence beyond
the North American continent to the countries, some allied by treaty and
some neutral. Such an extended deterrence is a " 'three- nation problem'
involving an aggressor nation, the United States, and some smaller
nation which is the object of the aggressor's designs and which
Washington seeks to protect. "22 Probing by an "aggressor nation" aims
to test U.S. commitment to these "smaller nations, " which constitute
the periphery of American interests and power. In the most successful
case, probing could achieve a dual purpose: first, it tests the level
and credibility of the commitment of the distant security patron, and
second, it can weaken the rival alliance. It does so by targeting the
foundation of the alliance, the belief that the alliance is beneficial
to both parties and that it is effective. As Michael Mandelbaum has
observed, alliances need to manage two concurrent fears: one of
entrapment, namely, of being dragged into undesirable wars of limited
significance and local interest, and one of abandonment, the
apprehension of often the weaker ally of be ing abandoned by its
security provider when the need comes. 23 Probing aims to increase the
rival's fear of entrapment while at the same time stoking worries of
abandonment among its weaker and more dependent partners. By harassing
the local interests of the rival's peripheral allies, the revisionist
power wants to drive up the risk of a local war, perceived by the rival
as a distraction and a potential drain of resources. At the same time,
it wants to indicate to the smaller allies that they may not rely on
their security provider to defend their local, narrow interest, and that
they may be abandoned. The goal is to drive a wedge in the opposing
alliance by leveraging the fundamental dilemma of alliances--- the fears
of entrapment and abandonment. This is where probing becomes more than a
simple test of the rival's strength. By targeting the outer edges of the
existing hegemon, and thus harassing its alliance system, the
revisionist is engaging in a much more significant endeavor. The contest
for regional, or global, control is in the end a contest for allies.
A.J.P. Taylor observed that when Germany "was bidding for the domination
of Europe" in the decade before the outbreak of World War I, "her chosen
method was to isolate the independent Powers one from another. "24 As we
point out in chapter 5, allies are, among other things, an extension of
the distant patron's power. Were they to peel away from the side of
their security guarantor--- or vice versa, were the security guarantor
to decide that the risk of continued support of a distant ally pressured
by a regional revisionist power is too big--- it would in either case
signify a retrenchment of power for that offshore patron. The loss of
allies is both a confirmation of the waning sway of that rival great
power as well as a further reduction in its reach. To be alone in inter
national relations is to be vulnerable, inviting further aggressive
behavior from the rival. Walter Lippmann observed in 1943, "No one knew,
not Hitler, not Stalin, not Chamberlain or Daladier, the relative
strength of the Axis and of the opposing combination. Only when Hitler
succeeded at Munich in separating the Franco- British allies from
Russia, had he so altered the balance of power in his favor that a war
for the conquest of Europe was from his point of view a good risk. "25
War is an extension of successful probing. The benefits of targeting
allies of a rival, rather than the rival itself, are well recognized in
history. The astute observer of history and politics Niccolò Machiavelli
noted in his Discourses that attacking a rival's ally is always a
preferred option: "For I know especially that if I assault his friend,
either he will resent it and I will have my intention of making war with
him, or by not resenting it he will uncover his weakness or
faithlessness in not defending a client of his. Both the one and the
other of these two things are able to take away his reputation and to
make my plans easier . "26 In the strategic behavior we describe, the
probing power is not interested in "making war" with the rival, and
therefore a probe is not a full- out attack on a rival's ally or
supported state. The risks of activating the security guarantees or
assurances that ought to be at the foundation of that alliance are too
big. But it is an offensive act of sorts, which threatens the interests
of the rival's ally. The security patron will either respond, thereby
disproving the perception of its weakness, or will not, "taking away his
reputation" and undermining its alliance. China has been particularly
astute in picking geographic objectives that are important to U.S.
allies but only indirectly important to the United States, such as the
shoals and reefs around the Spratly and Paracel Islands. By ratcheting
up the pressure in these areas, China causes the targeted states to
intensify their demands for American assurance while diminishing U.S.
willingness to back allies over seemingly petty issues that could lead
to a larger conflict. Americans do not want to risk their lives for
insignificant and distant rocks. Russia achieves a similar effect by
reigniting NATO's eastern frontier through its attack on Ukraine and a
series of threats against exposed NATO members around the Baltic Sea.
Those are areas that until recently have not been prominent on the U.S.
strategic radar screen but are naturally vital to those smaller states
inhabiting the region, which in turn are driven to make increasingly
vocal requests for security reassurances from Washington. As in the case
of the South China Sea, however, the local and limited nature of the
rival's probes generates in Washington as much a perception of threat as
fear of a larger conflict, raising doubts about the benefits of
extending security guarantees to these allies and partners. In the end,
these peripheral probes pursued by U.S. rivals can create a wedge
between Washington and its regional friends and allies. These three
features--- low intensity, low risk but high reward, peripheral--- point
also to the timing of the probing behavior. Probing is a strategic
behavior that arises out of an uncertain assessment of power relations.
It is the product of doubt, not confidence, in the resilience of the
existing international order. As such it arises early on in the
transition of power, when perceptions of rise and decline are not firm.
The vagueness of the security environment creates among revisionist
powers the perception of opportunities that a probing behavior aims to
test. Hence probing should occur with less frequency in the immediate
aftermath of a war, when, as we point out, an assessment of relative
power carries the weight of the ultimate test, war. A defeated power may
have all the incentives to upset the existing order, but unless it has
no ability to evaluate its clearly weakened position, it has no capacity
to do so. After a defeat probing may be tempting but is unfeasible. Such
states are more likely to pursue a policy of recueillement
(introspection, a moment of pause and strengthening), characterized by
internal reforms, modernization, and very limited foreign engagements
mostly aimed at dividing the opposing alliance.27 When, however, the
perceived weakening of the founding power puts in doubt the existing
international settlement, the desire to revise it is matched by the
possibility of doing so. The perception of American weakening, or at
least retrenchment, therefore opens up a window of opportunity for those
powers that aspire to expand their own influence and resent the Western
order and its institutions. THE AUDIENCES OF PROBING Another useful way
of looking at the strategic behavior of probing is by considering the
audiences involved. As we argued, a revisionist power pursues probing
behavior to check whether new boundaries of influence are feasible given
the perceived weakening of the rival. The main purpose is therefore to
elicit a response from the targeted audiences. That response, or lack
thereof, supplies information necessary to draw the new outline of the
geopolitical map. Probing is first and foremost a violent and risky
didactic exercise. The most direct audience is the immediate target of
the probing behavior, usually an ally, or an aspirant to be an ally, of
the rival great power. Probing here seeks to gauge the willingness and
capacity of the targeted state to withstand pressure, and ultimately it
aims to push that state to sever itself from its security patron. As we
examine in chapter 4, vulnerable frontier allies of a great power
actively consider alternative strategic options, especially when they
perceive themselves to be under threat from a neighboring revisionist
pow er and to have a fraying security guarantee from a distant patron. A
probe is meant to ratchet up the threat perception while also attempting
to establish a sense of strategic isolation and separation from the
security provider. Hence as important as, if not more important than,
the first audience is the second one: the distant but more powerful ally
and security provider. Probing tests indirectly the regional staying
power of the rival hegemon. While carefully avoiding direct
confrontation, the revisionist power wants to assess the commitment of
the opposing great power to its ally in the near neighborhood. What the
revisionist is testing, therefore, is not the rival's resolve to oppose
other great powers, but the rival's reliability to its own allies.28
Resolve is the willingness to risk war to achieve one's own objectives:
the more diffuse and distant the threatened interests, the less the
resolve. Given that the target of probes is peripheral and not the
rival's homeland or troops and bases, the resolve is assumed to be
small. Direct war between the revisionist probing state and the rival
great power is unlike ly to erupt as a result. Moreover, the probing
state is not interested in finding out whether the rival has the will to
fight a direct war: the stakes would be simply too high and the outcome
too uncertain. A direct challenge would test the resolve of the rival.
Poking around the periphery, therefore, is a poor test of the rival's
willingness to fight a war. History seems to confirm this. For instance,
as scholars have pointed out, Soviet leaders did not think that U.S.
responses to peripheral threats (e.g., in the Third World) could serve
as indicators of future American behavior when its core interests (NATO
allies, Japan, or the U.S. homeland) were threatened.29 Whether the
United States responded militarily or not to a Soviet foray in Angola or
Ethiopia could not be easily translated into expectations of future
American behavior in Europe. But it does affect the perception of
whether the United States wants to fight in other peripheral areas. "If
Soviet leaders were to gain the impression that the United States is
firmly set upon a course of neo- isolationism and the absolute avoidance
of intervention in local wars, they might become dangerously adventurous
in the Middle East and elsewhere. "30

[Probing]{.underline}, however, [tests the reliability of the rival
great power--- that is, its willingness to **protect**]{.underline} and
stand by [its **ally**]{.underline} or aspiring allies. The immediate
target is not a test of the rival's general credibility but only of its
commitment to the security ties to the state. Probing wants to elicit a
response (or lack thereof) from the rival great power regarding the
seriousness of its commitment to the directly targeted state. [To be
**perceived** as a **reliable** ally means to **instill the belief**
that **promised** security guarantees will **hold** **even in cases of
heightened tensions** and, in final analysis, of conflict. Consequently
a **perception of low reliability** results in the belief that the
**alliance is fragile** and that it may be in the small state's interest
to seek accommodation with the nearby revisionist power]{.underline}. As
delineated above, probes are care fully tailored to split the distant
security patron from its regional allies, showing it to be unreliable.

Even if it achieves nothing else, probing can introduce doubts about the
security guarantees, forcing the security patron to renew its promises.
[The **less reliable** the security patron is perceived by its allies,
the more insistent are their **demands** for **continued** security
guarantees]{.underline}. Probing thus imposes an immediate cost on the
rival great power by reactivating a frontier region that until then was
dormant and by pressing the rival to expend more resources and political
capital to reassert its security guarantees.

Finally, the third audience is composed of the geopolitical onlookers,
[states]{.underline} that are **[watch]{.underline}**ing the [behavior
and derive]{.underline} their own [conclusions about the resilience of
the existing great power. The strategic interaction]{.underline} spurred
by a probe [does not **directly** affect them, but they perceive it as a
regionally circumscribed development with potentially more **global
repercussions**. That is, [a probe]{.mark} is limited to a specific
region but [has **radiating effects**]{.mark} as [others]{.mark} also
**[see it for]{.mark} what it really is**[: a **test** of]{.mark} the
**resilience** and [**reliability**]{.mark} of the great power that may
be [**analogous** in **other regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Recent academic literature puts in doubt the idea that reputation for
commitment is interdependent]{.underline}. Thomas Schelling, among
others, articulated that idea in his classic work from 1966 where he
argued that [U.S. **rep**utation was **global**]{.underline}, and [a
loss in one region]{.underline} would [have negative impact in **other
areas**. **Rep**utation was **not compartmentalized**]{.underline} in
different regions, in large measure because the rival, the Soviet Union,
was one and the same across the world map. Hence "we tell the Soviets
that we have to react here because, if we did not, they would not
believe us when we say that we will react there. "31
[Academics]{.underline} have relentlessly [questioned this argument,
resulting in]{.underline} copious [writings asserting that reputation is
not interdependent and]{.underline}, according to some, [does not even
matter]{.underline}.32 Reputation is merely a cult and does not exist in
international relations.33 Policy makers, however, disagree and continue
to speak of reputation for resolve and reliability as something that not
only matters and requires constant work but also is interdependent. They
prefer to rely on time- tested authors, from Thucydides to Machiavelli,
who consider reputation as indispensable to political power.34 In brief,
there is a deep gap between academics and policy makers on the issue of
reputation.

[By observing recent events in the three frontier regions--- **Central
Europe**, the **Middle East**, and **East Asia**--- we think that the
truth is closer to Schelling's view. It is clear that the effects of
probing behavior **do not remain confined** to the immediate actors
involved]{.underline} (the probing power, the direct target--- usually a
rival's ally--- and the rival great power). **[Other
actors]{.underline}** in the region [are **keenly aware** of
the]{.underline} revisionist state's probing and of the [responses of
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. For instance,
other states, from the Baltics to Poland and Ukraine, observed Russia's
war against Georgia in 2008 and its invasion of Crimea in 2014 with
great trepidation.35 These wars were symptoms of a more assertive
Russia; a source of worry in themselves. But they were also meant to
elicit an answer from the United States. [**Any sign** of **American
hesitation**]{.underline} to respond quickly and firmly to Russian small
wars in the two states [was **perceived** as **affect**ing
directly]{.underline} these [**other states**, **not** directly
involved]{.underline} in the probing event. [America's **reputation**
for **reliability**, in other words, was at stake]{.underline}, even
though Georgia and Ukraine were not NATO members but only aspiring to
closer security and political relations with the United States and the
EU. Similarly, Pacific nations from Japan to Australia follow with great
attention China's probing behavior in the South China Sea that puts
pressure on Vietnam, the Philippines, and Taiwan. They too seek to
figure out whether the United States has the will to remain as a
security provider in this region and to the "global commons" in general.
How the United States responds to a probe in a particular region
therefore affects its regional image.

The question is whether [[there is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a]{.mark}
**wider, [global audience]{.mark}** to **regional probes**]{.underline}.
Do **[[Middle East]{.mark}ern leaders [watch]{.mark} American responses
to [Russia's probing]{.mark} in Eastern Europe]{.underline}**? Do
Kremlin elites draw lessons from U.S. actions along the "first chain of
islands" in East Asia? Or, do Chinese neo- Mahanian leaders think the
United States is on the wane if it accommodates Putin's imperial
fantasies? According to the latest academic literature, the answer
should be negative: how the United States is perceived to be doing in
one region does not translate into a similar perception elsewhere. The
practical implication of such a view is that the United States should
not have fought in Vietnam to prove that it would stand its ground in
Europe; similarly, it ought not to oppose Putin around the Black Sea
basin simply to demonstrate that it will oppose China in the South China
Sea. But we are not so confident that [there are]{.underline} no
[**connections** between regional demonstrations of will and
power]{.underline}. It is at least plausible, and perhaps safer, to
argue that [there are **wider, global effects**]{.underline} of probing.
First, [the world is]{.underline} indeed [**global**, and regions are
**not hermetically separated** from each other]{.underline}. As Nicholas
Spykman observed, "[Global war]{.underline}, as well as global peace,
[means that **[all fronts]{.mark}**]{.underline} and all areas [[are
**interrelated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. No matter how remote they are
from each other, [**success or failure in [one]{.mark}** [will have an
**immediate and determining effect** on the
**others**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is necessary, therefore, to see the
world as a whole and to weigh the measures taken to achieve victory in
the light of conditions in all theaters. "36 [Leaders **watch** and
**learn** from **other regions**, more than previously in history when
conflicts were limited by technology and geographic knowledge to a
contiguous region]{.underline}. Because of their domestic opacity, it is
difficult to prove that America's rivals learn from U.S. behavior in
other regions, but the question whether they do so needs to be asked.
Chinese military officials, for example, have commented publicly on
lessons for China from the U.S. handling of the war in Ukraine.37 As one
analyst noted, "It might be impossible to determine definitively whether
the **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** Crisis has [[impacted
**China's**]{.mark} risk [calculus in]{.mark} **hotspots** such as [the
**S**]{.mark}**outh [and E]{.mark}ast [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, but the evidence . . . certainly suggests
that such eastern reverberations are quite plausible. "38 At a minimum
we have to recognize that some [**cross- regional**
analyses]{.underline} do **[occur]{.underline}**, and it is safer to
assume that the [U.S. reputation does **not stay limited** to a
region]{.underline}.

Second, [the much **strong**er effect of probing appears to be on U.S.
**[allies]{.mark}** and friends, the **key geopolitical spectators**.
They [**watch** how the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[treats **other allies** and form an
**opinion**]{.mark} regarding American reliability]{.underline}. The
former director of Saudi intelligence summed up the view of many
[officials from]{.underline} U.S. allied [states in the **Persian
Gulf**]{.underline} when he said in **[react]{.underline}**ion
[to]{.underline} the Russian seizure of **[Crimea]{.underline}**, "While
the wolf is eating the sheep, there is no shepherd to come to the
rescue. "39 [Israel was interested in the war in Georgia;
**Japan**]{.underline}ese analysts [followed the]{.underline} Obama
[administration's decision to cancel]{.underline} the Ballistic Missile
Defense ([BMD]{.underline}) program [in Central Europe]{.underline}; and
Polish experts watch U.S. moves in East Asia.40 The probing by
revisionist states is first and foremost an attempt to test the strength
of their rival's commitment to its allies and friends. In sum, probing
behavior by revisionist states targets these specific audiences in order
to elicit responses from them. The goal is to figure out whether and how
to draw the new map of power. And it puts the burden on the targeted
audiences: their responses determine whether the probe is successful.

EVALUATION OF PROBING: SUCCESS OR FAILURE

From the perspective of the revisionist power that engages in probing,
whether a probe has achieved its objectives determines its success or
failure. The minimum objective of the probing state is to measure the
rival's staying power in its neighboring region, an objective that is
achieved whether the targeted powers respond or not, but it is difficult
to interpret. The targeted rival may be tempted to ignore the probe not
out of a sense of its own weakness but in the belief that ignoring the
test will send a signal of strategic insouciance from its pedestal of
power. Also, because of the local and limited nature of a probe,
directly involving only the regional actors, it is tempting for the
distant security provider to leave the response to its allies and
friends. A direct and strong intervention by the offshore patron would
escalate the interaction, raising the chances of a larger war, an
outcome that neither party desires. But the shrewdness of a probing
strategy is that it puts the targeted rival power in the position of
having either to escalate the tensions in order to respond or to choose
a less confrontational approach but one that risks weakening its
alliances. The response to the probe, not the probe itself, is perceived
as a potential cause of war. This creates strong disincentives for the
tested great power to react by opposing the revisionist state's probe in
a direct and forceful way, or to respond at all. For instance, in the
case of China's probing actions in the South China Sea, the Obama
administration's approach seems to have been to accommodate Beijing,
acknowledging a decline in U.S. naval capabilities and welcoming a
greater Chinese role in providing security to the global commons.41
Similarly, after Russia's takeover of Crimea, Washington's first
response was to turn the episode into a strictly regional affair. As
President Obama put it in February 2014, "Any violation of Ukraine's
sovereignty and territorial integrity would be deeply destabilizing,
which is not in the interest of Ukraine, Russia, or Europe, " tellingly
not including the United States in the list of the affected parties.42

The problem is that the temptation of the existing great power to either
ignore or regionalize the tension stemming from the revisionist state's
probes--- an attempt to de- escalate the strategic interaction--- also
constitutes a response. It may, however, be one that serves for the
revisionist power as a confirmation of its initial suspicion that the
rival's commitment to the region was on the wane. [An
**unanswered**]{.underline}--- ignored or regionalized--- [probe is an
indication that the]{.underline} existing [map of power is **open to
revisions**]{.underline}. Another way to put this is that a probe is a
question of sorts: does the existing hegemon have the will and capacity
to oppose the revisionist power? An attempt to dismiss the question or
to let allies respond to it is a tacit admission by the tested great
power that its interest in maintaining a strong foothold and influence
in the region is in decline. Silence in response to a probe is telling.
Probing, therefore, always elicits some sort of answer, and in this
narrow sense it is a success.

The purpose of a probe is also to attain a secondary, albeit crucial,
goal of beginning to redraw the map of influence without generating
counterbalancing pressures from the tested great power and its allies.
The most successful probe would be one that pushes the targeted small
states and other regional spectators closer to the revisionist power (or
at least convinces them to distance themselves from their existing
security patron, the rival great power) while at the same time
convincing the rival great power that it is too costly to maintain its
political influence and provide security in the region. Hence the probe
needs to be evaluated on what it achieves in the three audiences: the
directly targeted neighboring small state, the distant security patron,
and the geopolitical onlookers (in particular other states in the
region). The success or failure of a revisionist state's probe depends
on the actions by these three groups, and, arguably, it can attain
partial success by achieving a revision of the status quo in one
audience but not the other.

For instance, a probe can succeed in extending the revisionist power's
influence over the immediate target, the ally or would- be ally of the
rival, but at the same time it may generate more vigorous efforts by
regional onlookers to counterbalance it through a variety of strategies,
ranging from military modernization to tighter defense cooperation with
the distant security patron. This seems to be the case for Russia's
takeover of Crimea. Moscow quickly conquered Crimea and destabilized
Ukraine's easternmost oblast, successfully demonstrating its ability and
willingness to use force to achieve limited territorial adjustments.
While Kiev maintains its political independence, it has also been shown
to be weak and unable to oppose Russian pressures. The quasi-- civil war
in the eastern regions and Russia's conquest of Crimea make Ukraine an
unlikely candidate for a closer relationship with the EU and NATO, even
if Ukrainian political elites and public opinion may continue to be in
favor of it. Russia's probe, in the form of its intervention in Crimea
and eastern Ukraine, has thus been successful in neutering the westward
drift of Kiev. The EU, and in particular states such as France and
Germany, have now an even smaller desire to bring Ukraine closer, as it
is deemed too dangerous and risky; Ukraine is not worth losing business
deals with Russia, not to mention starting a war with Russia.

The Ukraine War has also damaged American credibility in the region.
Washington after all had given assurances (not "guarantees, " which are
reserved for NATO members) to the Ukrainian government in the Budapest
Memorandum of 1994. This is undoubtedly a Russian success. But there are
also other consequences of Russia's probing, unintended and unwelcome by
Moscow. Some states in the Central European region, in particular Poland
and the Baltic states, have awakened from the geopolitical vacation of
the past two decades. The 1990s and the 2000s were characterized by a
widespread sense that threats to the territorial security of the region
were minimal, and most of the strategic focus was on economic
cooperation with the EU and on keeping in the good graces of the United
States through participation in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is
over, at least in part. While strengthening the EU continues to be a
priority in Central European capitals, there is simply no more interest
in "out- of- area" operations, which drain resources and time from
territorial defense. From this perspective, Russian probes have altered
the geostrategic outlook of some Central European states. The eastern
frontier is what really matters to them now, as their threat assessment
has changed. Russia, in other words, has reached an upper threshold in
its probes, creating a backlash among some of the states in the region,
which are pursuing diplomatic counterbalancing and defense
modernization. They are also calling for more visible and permanent NATO
(and in particular, U.S.) security presence on their territories to
shore up the extended deterrent against Russia.

It appears therefore that Russia is less successful than the other
revisionist power, China. [Moscow is less subtle in its
probes]{.underline}, choosing dramatic military interventions (Georgia
and Crimea) that generate growing fear and opposition among some
European states as well as the United States. In part Moscow's more
aggressive behavior is a result of a Russian assessment of the weakness
and divisions of the West. But in part the seeming Russian rush to
restore influence over its "near neighborhood" is due to internal
demographic, economic, and political problems. The growing weakness of
Russia, [a great power]{.underline} more by courtesy and [by **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline} than by economic and political strength, gives
little time to Putin to shore up his country's position facing China's
rapid economic growth and Europe's political appeal. It is a short- term
approach of large probes, and it may be successful only by extending
influence over its most immediate nearby target.43

[China]{.underline}, on the other hand, may have a different time frame,
allowing it to probe in a much more indirect and less violent way,
though this could change in the months ahead. It [is]{.underline}
therefore more careful and [guarded, pursuing]{.underline} a long- term
strategy of small [probes over]{.underline}, quite literally, small
rocks in [the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea. The U.S. "pivot" or "rebalancing" to Asia makes
American presence and resolve more pronounced, increasing the doubt of a
U.S. retrenchment and thus, from China's perspective, the need to be
cautious in testing the limits of American influence and commitment.
Moreover, the counterbalancing efforts of regional onlookers, from Japan
to the Philippines and Vietnam, are increasing in intensity, in both the
rhetoric used and the arms buildup. Similarly, unlike Russia in Crimea,
Beijing has not succeeded in extending its direct control over a large
piece of real estate. But in the end it may be more successful, because
it is establishing a gradual change in the map of power, visible only
after a decade- long period. Through its probes, China is pursuing a
classic example of "salami tactics. " As Thomas Schelling describes
them, "If there is no sharp qualitative division between a minor
transgression and a major affront, but a continuous gradation of
activity, one can begin his intrusion on a scale too small to provoke a
reaction, and increase it by imperceptible degrees, never quite
presenting a sud den, dramatic challenge that would invoke the committed
response. "44 Many small probes into areas of contested influence do not
individually invite a strong response, but they erode steadily the
perception and in the end the reality of the opponent's influence.

Moreover, a continuing sequence of gradual probes signals the
seriousness of the revisionist's intent to alter the status quo. In the
mind of the hegemon, the steady drumbeat of low- intensity and
peripheral incidents creates the impression that the revisionist both
has special claims for and may someday be willing to fight over a
particular piece of real estate. These claims are often backed up by
legal, historical, or ethnic justifications and a creeping physical
presence--- in Ukraine, Russian forces and equipment; in the South China
Sea, artificially created reefs. Over time, this places the onus of a
response on the shoulders of the hegemon and its allies in the region
for why the status quo should be maintained. For a weary hegemon like
the United States today, probes communicate that the act of supporting
the regional status quo is no longer cost free but will require a level
of exertion that was not needed in the past, inevitably leading to
questions of whether such effort and resulting escalation are
worthwhile.

Nonetheless, it is certainly possible to see failed instances of
probing, which achieve the opposite of the revisionist power's
intentions. The historic scorecard of probing states is mixed. A clear
failure of probing would be if the targeted regional states and offshore
security patron responded strongly, tightening their alliance and even
initiating a direct **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This [[is]{.mark}
**[a]{.mark}**n **unintended [consequence]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a
probe [and can take several forms]{.underline}, from a tightening of
alliances countering the revisionist power to increased military
contingency planning and rearming. In the worst- case scenario, [it
results in a combination of actions that **counterbalance**]{.underline}
the revisionist state more effectively and forcefully than before the
probing behavior started. The revisionist state did not want nor expect
this response before engaging in probing. It amounts to a
disconfirmation of the initial hypothesis that the rival great power is
in decline and retreat, and in the end it worsens the strategic position
of the probing state.

The biggest loser may thus be the probing power, which puts in motion a
series of strategic interactions that undermine its own strength. This
was the case of Germany in the early twentieth century. Kaiser Wilhelm's
visit to Tangier in 1905 initiated the first Moroccan crisis,
manufactured by Berlin to, among other objectives, probe the strength of
the brand new and untested Franco- British Entente Cordiale. 45 By
challenging French interests in Morocco in a nonviolent way, Berlin
wanted to pressure Paris, "the weakest link in the surrounding chain" of
states opposing Germany.46 But it desired to do that in an area and in a
way that were expected not to draw Great Britain into a direct
confrontation, so that Germany could demonstrate to Paris that the
entente was in effect useless. Morocco was important to France but not
to Great Britain, and the German Foreign Office expected that London
would not back Paris. Great Britain after all was also seen as
retrenching after a bloody war with the Boers and unable and unwilling
to project power on land to guarantee the security of its French quasi-
ally. As Friedrich von Holstein put it, the French would seek a
rapprochement with Germany, in effect bandwagoning, "when they have seen
that English friendship . . . is not enough to gain Germany's agreement
to the French seizure of Morocco, but rather that Germany wishes to be
loved on its own account. "47 Germany, however, greatly miscalculated
the British need for a continental ally and resulting commitment to
France. The Moroccan crisis was resolved in a multilateral conference in
Algeciras where Berlin ended in a position that was considerably worse
than before the crisis: its only support was from the weak Austro-
Hungarian Empire, while London was firmly and actively on the side of
Paris. Instead of weakening the nascent strategic friendship between
Britain and France, "German bullying" strengthened it.48 From then on,
the "European Balance of Power, which had been ignored for forty years,
again dominated British foreign policy; and henceforth every German move
was interpreted as a bid for continental hegemony. "49 London reoriented
its attention away from the empire and toward the European continent,
gradually planning to ready an expeditionary force to come to France's
defense.50 Berlin's probe in Morocco turned into a clear failure.51

Probing is low risk, insofar as it is tailored to minimize a strong
reaction of the rival, but it is not danger free for the revisionist
state. Despite the fact that it arises out of a desire to clarify an
allegedly new map of power, the effects of probing are difficult to
interpret. [All [parties]{.mark} involved]{.underline}--- the
revisionist power and the targeted states--- [can
**[miscalc]{.mark}ulate**]{.underline} their reactions. In a case of
moral hazard, the [smaller states]{.underline}, directly targeted by the
revisionist power, may respond violently to the low- intensity probe,
feeling secure thanks to the alliance with a more powerful patron. Or,
[[sensing]{.mark} that [their]{.mark} distant [patron is no longer
capable]{.mark} of maintaining]{.underline} its [influence, they may
decide]{.underline} the exact opposite [and accept the hegemony of the
rival]{.underline}. This was the case of Athenian allies in Thrace,
switching sides under General Brasidas's pressure and persuasion. They
were mistaken because their "judg ment was based more upon blind wishing
than upon any sound prediction. "52 Athens rallied and sent large forces
north to restore its sway.

[The probing power can]{.underline} also be the one to
**[miscalculate]{.underline}**, either not seeing the success or
ignoring the failure. The nature of probing is such that the effects are
often not visible immediately and require time to alter the perceptions
and realities of power. The episode of Spartan commander Brasidas is
again telling. Sparta did not follow up on his successes, in part
because Spartan kings were jealous of his military exploits, but in part
because they thought the damage inflicted on Athens was sufficient to
strike a deal and end the war.53 They were of course wrong, as the war
continued for decades. Alternatively, despite being checked, the probing
power may simply up the ante, seeking some gain. This may have been the
case of Germany, which did not stop challenging France and Britain after
1905, despite its diplomatic isolation, the military conundrum of a two-
front war, and a robust Franco- British entente. In brief, there is no
easy single interpretation of a probe and its effects.

[A related risk is]{.underline} that a probe may lead [to an unintended
and untimely **escalation**]{.underline} of the strategic rivalry. As we
described, the purpose of probing is to see how permissive the
geopolitical order is, and to that goal a probe is limited in geographic
reach and means used. It targets an issue presumed peripheral to the
rival great power, seeking, for instance, a small territorial adjustment
that is costly to the weaker neighboring state but not deemed worthy of
a direct conflict by the distant and more powerful security patron. But
the limited nature of the probe is somewhat at odds with its ultimate
purpose to check the limits of an allegedly declining rival great power.
A probe is a low- intensity, local pinprick with wider repercussions;
limited geographically yet potentially global in outcome. The probing
state has a strong interest in keeping the crisis limited and circum
scribed to the narrowly defined area, but it is also poking the rival
great pow er to see what the reaction may be. It is banking on the fact
that the probe is on the periphery of the rival's influence and
interests, and thus that the rival will not escalate the interaction.
The probing challenger, in other words, is betting that its great power
rival will fear entrapment, being involved in an undesirable conflict,
more than loss of prestige, reputation, or influence. The revisionist
power seeks to use the fact of alliances (which it lacks itself) as a
source of competitive disadvantage for the hegemon. This is based on two
reinforcing perceptions--- first, that the commitment involved in their
maintenance is an encumbrance depriving the hegemon of strategic
flexibility; and second, that the hegemon's temptation to devalue its
own alliances suggests that it feels the weight of this encumbrance.

Probes therefore arise from a view that entrapment is the congenital
flaw of alliances. They are the ultimate act of attempting to expose the
dangers of entrapment to hegemon and ally alike. This is ultimately a
gamble--- an expectation, not a certainty. And [the gamble can
**backfire**]{.underline}, as there is always the possibility that [a
probe will result in a **dramatic escalation** since it is targeted at
**multiple audiences**]{.underline}. There is thus a clear recognition
that a probe has a much wider purpose than its immediate action may
convey, and consequently the desire to keep it limited runs against the
desire to have a much larger demonstrative effect. As a result, [the
interaction a probe initiates has an **inherent risk** of **escalating**
into a **much larger confrontation**]{.underline}.54

The revisionist state neither desires nor expects the escalation, but
its possibility and perhaps likelihood are a direct outcome of probing.
A probe by definition crosses a limit, a tacit or an explicit line of
influence, in the expectation that it no longer reflects the actual will
and power of the rival state. The revisionist power tests limits that
until then were accepted and unchallenged and takes the first step in an
"escalatory ladder" of competitive behavior. For instance, Kaiser
Wilhelm's support of Boer independence in 1896 was a test of British
strength in what Berlin wrongly thought was a peripher al area of the
British Empire. Similarly, the Moroccan crisis in 1905 was a test of
British commitment to France in a region that should have been of no
importance to London. Both, however, were a "move in the European
Balance of Power, " and that, beyond the details of the individual
probes, was becoming of paramount concern to Great Britain. 55 Both were
met by a strong British response, intensifying the Anglo- British
rivalry. Escalation here was a willful choice of the targeted power.

Finally, probing can be in many cases a violent act, raising even
further the likelihood of escalation and war. Probing is a political act
first and foremost, only at times pursued by military means, but it does
involve a careful application of violence or threat of violence. This
requires strict political control, which is easier to maintain if the
probe is not militarized and violent. But the more violent it becomes,
the more difficult it is to keep it under political control. The logic
of war may overwhelm the political rationale. Bismarck was keenly aware
that the limited wars he fought, such as the Franco- Prussian one in
1870, would result in political outcomes that were different from his
objectives were other great powers to become involved. But his greatest
obstacle was the German military, resentful of civilian interference in
what they deemed to be affairs in their exclusive purview. Political
control over a limited war is paramount, because otherwise operational
war objectives can overwhelm the larger political goals.56 The fact that
Russia and China probe through a variety of nontraditional means, such
as fishing vessels in the South China Sea and specially formed
battalions (Vostok) of Chechens, makes political control more difficult.
There is an incentive to use such means in a more aggressive way than
would be warranted by official state forces, because in case of defeat
one can always deny control over them and claim that they are simply
individual citizens. Moreover, the "civilian" paramilitary forces that
the probing power uses (e.g., the "Russian separatists" in eastern
Ukraine) may not be easily recalled if the conflict ceases to be useful.
The civilianization of conflict has its own risks. This makes probing
behavior inherently destabilizing to an international order, as it sets
forces in motion that, once unleashed, can be hard to control.

[Probing can]{.underline}, moreover, [**spiral** into
**war**]{.underline}, unexpected and perhaps unwanted by the revisionist
power. For instance, in the third century BC, Rome started to probe
Carthaginian power in Sicily. It extended protection to Messana (or,
more precisely, to a band of mercenaries, the Mamertines, who controlled
it), thereby asserting Roman influence in northern Sicily. The peaceful
withdrawal of the Punic garrison from the area seemed to suggest that a
war was avoidable and the probe successful in attaining a low- cost
revision to the balance of power. But the Romans miscalculated and were
emboldened by this small success. As Polybius put it, they "now
cherished the hope that they could drive the Carthaginians out of Sicily
altogether, and that once this goal was attained their own power would
be greatly increased. "57 Carthage sent a large force to Sicily and
solidified its alliance with Syracuse against Rome and its new ally
Messana. Rome then escalated and sent a large army to besiege Syracuse,
starting the first Punic war, which lasted more than twenty years.58
What started as a low- cost, low- risk probe turned into a long and
costly slugfest. To sum up, the risk of probing is that it may result in
a slide toward a direct clash. [**Miscalculation** and **escalation** by
all parties involved can **[elevate]{.mark}**]{.underline} what is [[a
small]{.mark}, localized [harassment into a **wider**]{.mark}**, more
violent [war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, a pattern of probing may
gradually lead all sides to accept war as necessary and perhaps
inevitable, as each probe and reaction escalates the competitive
interaction.

#### NATO key to countering China in SCS and ECS 

**[Brzezinski 6/1]{.underline}** - Ian Brzezinski is a Senior Fellow at
the Atlantic Council focusing on the Transatlantic Security Initiative
and the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. He is the Former
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Europe and NATO Policy, 2020
("NATO's role in a transatlantic strategy on China", available online at
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/natos-role-in-a-transatlantic-strategy-on-china/>,
The Atlantic Council)

On the eve of the NATO Summit in London last December, the Alliance's
Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg addressed the need for a collective
response to China's emergence as a global power]{.underline}. "This is
not about moving NATO into the South China Sea," he stated, "but [it's
about taking into account that China is coming closer to us---in the
Arctic, in Africa, investing heavily in our infrastructure in Europe, in
cyberspace.]{.underline}" At the summit, [NATO heads of state
diplomatically declared that China has become a concern:
"w]{.underline}e recognize that China's growing influence and
international policies present both opportunities and challenges that we
need to address together as an Alliance."

[Indeed, it is hard, if not impossible, for NATO to avoid
China]{.underline}[. **[Beijing presents a]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[full spectrum [challenge to the transatlantic
community]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a challenge whose potential mirrors,
if not surpasses, that once posed by the former Soviet Union. [China's
\$14 trillion economy is expected to soon surpass that of the United
States, and Beijing exercises that might in a **predatory fashion around
the globe**,]{.underline} including in the United States and Europe.
[China threatens to boycott companies and countries that criticize its
policies, leverages its debt instruments against poor nations, and is
buying up critical infrastructure around the world]{.underline}. Its
acquisition of European ports has raised concerns of top NATO commanders
who warn that such ownership could adversely affect the Alliance's
ability to use those facilities in times of crisis.

[[**China is a technological challenge to the West**.]{.mark} It is a
leader in [5G]{.mark} communications, [a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence, [hyper-sonic weapons, and quantum
computing]{.mark}. [It has demonstrated]{.mark} repeatedly that [it is
willing to exercise that prowess against Western interests and
security]{.mark}. Chinese cyber espionage and disinformation campaigns
have become part of daily life for all NATO allies, including both their
governments and private enterprises]{.underline}.

[Beijing's military is a major driver behind China's technological edge
and is developing and exercising global reach. China's \$260 billion
defense budget has a purchasing power estimated to equal or exceed 70
percent of that of the US defense budget.]{.underline} China's military
cooperation with Russia continues to expand and the two exercise not
only in the plains of Central Asia but in the Mediterranean and Baltic
Seas. **[[Chinese military forces]{.mark} are the pointy of end of the
spear Beijing uses to [undermine the rules based international
order]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[Its maritime claims and aggressive
activities in S]{.mark}outh [and E]{.mark}ast [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}eas [stand among its more prominent
actions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[And, China's leadership relishes its role as an ideological challenge
to the West and the latter's practice of liberal democracy. China
usesits economic, technological, and military power to promote globally
its form of national authoritarianism.]{.underline} Beijing even asserts
that its political model has provided the most adept and agile response
to today's coronavirus epidemic.

So how should NATO should respond to China's growing global
assertiveness? What should be NATO's China strategy?

When considering this issue, [it is important to recognize that **[the
foundation for a]{.mark} relevant [NATO role in a transatlantic China
strategy has long been established]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For decades,
the Alliance has been operating around the world[. NATO has led the
International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan since 2003. Its
naval forces have patrolled against pirates off the shores of Africa,
commencing with operation OCEAN SHIELD in 2008. As a member of the
Coalition to Defeat ISIS, NATO provides training to military
establishments across the Middle East. And, on a daily basis the
Alliance addresses terrorism, cyber-threats, disinformation, and other
global issues.]{.underline}

[[Most relevant]{.mark} to addressing China [are the Alliance's
long-standing relationships with key democracies of the Indo-Pacific
region]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [NATO established Global
Partnerships with Korea, New Zealand, and Mongolia in 2012, Australia in
2013, and Japan in 2014.]{.underline} These relationships are
predominantly consultative, but most of these partners have contributed
to NATO missions, including in Afghanistan.

[As the transatlantic community's lead instrument for security
collaboration, NATO can contribute to the former's relationship with
China in three important ways. [As a multinational security forum, it
can foster among NATO allies and partners a shared awareness of China's
capacitie]{.mark}s and activities that generate risk to and opportunity
for the North Atlantic community]{.underline}. [NATO has long served as
an important forum through which its Allies and partners share
intelligence data and assessments needed to foster and facilitate
collaborative action.]{.underline}

Second, [[NATO can help develop and promulgate a transatlantic security
strategy]{.mark} and posture regarding China. [That]{.mark} strategy's
objectives [should include the development of a cooperative relationship
with China]{.mark} as well the dissuasion of China from undermining the
interests of the transatlantic community.]{.underline} The latter would
define the appropriate role and means for the Alliance to contribute to
deterrence and when necessary defense against Chinese aggression that
imperil those interests.

Third, [[NATO's civilian and military capacities should be used to
facilitate]{.mark} the defense and security component of a Western
strategy addressing China---including in the tasks of [engagement,
deterrence, and defense]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### SCS war escalates to extinction.

**[Klare 17 --]{.underline}** Michael Klare, Professor of Peace and
World Security Studies at Hampshire College, "Escalation Watch: Four
Global Hotspots for Trump", Asia Times, 1-20,
http://www.atimes.com/article/escalation-watch-four-global-hotspots-trump/

Within months of taking office, President Donald Trump is likely to face
one or more [major international [crises]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly
[[entail]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[a risk of **nuclear
escalation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not since the end of the Cold War has
a new chief executive been confronted with as many [potential
[**flashpoints** involv]{.mark}]{.underline}ing such [a
[potential]{.mark} for **[explosive conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This proliferation of crises has been brewing for some time, but [the
situation appears **[especially]{.mark} ominous** now [given
Trump]{.mark}'s pledge to bring American military force swiftly to bear
on any threats of foreign transgression]{.underline}. With so much at
risk, it's none too soon to go on a permanent escalation watch,
monitoring the major global hotspots for any sign of imminent flare-ups,
hoping that early warnings (and the outcry that goes with them) might
help avert catastrophe.

Looking at the world today, four [[areas]{.mark} appear to [pose
a]{.mark}n **especially [high risk]{.mark}** [of sudden]{.mark} crisis
and [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}: North Korea, [[the
**S**]{.mark}**outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea**]{.underline}, the
Baltic Sea region, and the Middle East. Each of them has been the past
site of recurring clashes, and all are primed to explode early in the
Trump presidency.

Why are we seeing so many potential crises now? Is this period really
different from earlier presidential transitions?

It's true that the changeover from one presidential administration to
another can be a time of global uncertainty, given America's pivotal
importance in world affairs and the natural inclination of rival powers
to test the mettle of the country's new leader. There are, however,
other factors that make this moment particularly worrisome, including
the changing nature of the world order, the personalities of its key
leaders, and an ominous shift in military doctrine.

Trump may lift gold as new leaders carry risk

Just as the United States is going through a major political transition,
so is the planet at large. [[The]{.mark} sole-superpower [system]{.mark}
of the post-Cold War era [is]{.mark} finally giving way to a multipolar,
if not increasingly [fragmented]{.mark}, world in which [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[must
share]{.mark} the limelight [with]{.mark}]{.underline} other major
actors, including [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia, India, and Iran.
Political scientists remind us that [transitional periods can often
prove disruptive, as "status quo" powers]{.underline} (in this case, the
United States) [resist challenges to their dominance from ["revisionist"
states]{.mark} seeking to alter the global power equation. Typically,
this [can entail **proxy wars** and]{.mark} other kinds of [sparring
over]{.mark} contested areas, as]{.underline} has recently been the case
[in]{.underline} Syria, the Baltic, and [[the **S**]{.mark}outh
**[C]{.mark}**hina **[S]{.mark}**ea]{.underline}.

This is where the personalities of key leaders enter the equation.
[Though]{.underline} President [[Obama]{.mark} oversaw constant warfare,
he [was]{.mark} temperamentally [disinclined to respond]{.mark} with
force]{.underline} to every overseas crisis and provocation, fearing
involvement in yet more foreign wars like Iraq and Afghanistan. His
critics, including Donald Trump, complained bitterly that this stance
only encouraged foreign adversaries to up their game, convinced that the
US had lost its will to resist provocation. In a Trump administration,
as The Donald indicated on the campaign trail last year, America's
adversaries should expect far tougher responses. Asked in September, for
instance, about an incident in the Persian Gulf in which Iranian
gunboats approached American warships in a threatening manner, he
typically told reporters, "When they circle our beautiful destroyers
with their little boats and make gestures that ... they shouldn't be
allowed to make, they will be shot out of the water."

Although with Russia, unlike Iran, Trump has promised to improve
relations, there's no escaping the fact that Vladimir Putin's urge to
restore some of his country's long-lost superpower glory could lead to
confrontations with Nato powers that would put the new American
president in a distinctly awkward position. Regarding Asia,
[[Trump]{.mark} has often spoken of his intent to punish
China]{.underline} for what he considers its predatory trade practices,
a stance guaranteed to clash with President Xi Jinping's goal of
restoring his country's greatness. [This [should]{.mark}]{.underline},
in turn, [[generate **additional possibilities** for
confrontation]{.mark}, especially in the contested South China
Sea.]{.underline} Both Putin and Xi, moreover, are facing economic
difficulties at home and view foreign adventurism as a way of
distracting public attention from disappointing domestic performances.

[[NATO's retirement would]{.underline}]{.mark} thirdly [[exacerbate

NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} in this respect [because it has no military
structure, few capabilities and no superpower leadership]{.underline} to
bring divergent views together.

Germany and France already seek a plan B [[should NATO

European Union, [[an all-European approach is likely to fail. The added

#### Extinction

"How World War III Became Possible", 6-29,
<http://www.vox.com/2015/6/29/8845913/russia-war>)

[[Europe]{.mark} today looks disturbingly similar to the
Europe]{.underline} of just over 100 years ago, [on the eve of World War
I. It [is a tangle of]{.mark} military commitments [and]{.mark} defense
pledges, some of them unclear and thus **[easier to
trigger]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Its leaders have given vague
signals]{.underline} for what would and would not lead to war. Its
[political tensions have become military buildups. Its nations are
[teetering on]{.mark} an [unstable]{.mark} balance of [power, **barely
held together**]{.mark}]{.underline} by a Cold War--era alliance that no
longer quite applies. If you take a walk around Washington or a Western
European capital today, there is no feeling of looming catastrophe. The
threats are too complex, with many moving pieces and overlapping layers
of risk adding up to a larger danger that is less obvious. People can be
forgiven for not seeing the cloud hanging over them, for feeling that
all is well --- even as in Eastern Europe they are digging in for war.
But this [complacency is]{.underline} itself [part of the problem,
making the threat more difficult to foresee, to manage, or]{.underline},
potentially, [to avert. There is a **growing chorus** of political
analysts, arms control experts, and government officials who are
sounding the alarm, trying to call the world\'s attention to its drift
toward disaster. [The prospect of]{.mark} a major]{.underline} war, even
a [**[nuclear war]{.mark}**, in Europe [has become]{.mark}
thinkable]{.underline}, they warn, [even [plausible]{.mark}. What they
describe is a [threat]{.mark} that [combines]{.mark} many of the
[**hair-trigger dangers** and **world-ending stakes**]{.mark} of the
Cold War with the volatility and false calm that preceded World War
I]{.underline} --- a comparison I heard with disturbing frequency. They
describe a number of ways that an unwanted but nonetheless major war,
like that of 1914, could break out in the Eastern European borderlands.
[The stakes]{.underline}, they say, [could not be higher]{.underline}:
[the post--World War II peace in Europe]{.underline}, the lives of
thousands or millions of Eastern Europeans, [or even]{.underline}, in a
worst-case scenario that is remote but real, [the nuclear devastation of
the planet]{.underline}.

[In the 1950s and 1960s]{.underline}, [Americans]{.underline}
**[genuinely]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[rightly]{.underline}**
[feared the prospect of **nuclear war**]{.underline} [with the Soviet
Union]{.underline}. Schoolchildren regularly participated in air raid
drills. Federal, state and local governments prepared for operations in
the event of a nuclear emergency. More than a few worried citizens built
backyard bomb shelters and stockpiled provisions.

[Today]{.underline}, [that]{.underline} **[old dread]{.underline}** [of
disaster has all but **disappeared**]{.underline}, as have the systems
that helped preclude it. [But the **actual
[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of nuclear catastrophe is]{.mark}
**much [great]{.mark}er**]{.underline} than we realize.
**[Diplomacy]{.underline}** [and a **desire for global
peace**]{.underline} [have given way to **complacency**]{.underline}
[and a **[false sense of security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that nuclear
escalation is **outside the realm of possibility**]{.underline}. [That
[leaves us]{.mark} **unprepared**]{.underline}
[for]{.underline}---[and]{.underline} **[highly
[vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}---[a]{.underline}
[**nuclear attack** from Russia.]{.underline}

The most recent sign of American complacency was the death, a few weeks
ago, of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty---a pivotal 1987
agreement that introduced intrusive on-site inspection provisions,
destroyed an entire class of dangerous weaponry, and convinced both
Washington and Moscow that the other wanted strategic stability more
than strategic advantage. The New START treaty, put in place during the
Obama administration, appears headed for a similar fate in 2021. In
fact, nearly all the key U.S.-Russian arms control and
confidence-building provisions of the Cold War era are dead or on life
support, with little effort underway to update or replace them.

Meanwhile, U[.S. officials from both parties are focused not on how we
might **avoid**]{.underline} [nuclear catastrophe but on **showing how
tough they can look**]{.underline} [against]{.underline} a revanchist
Russia and its leader, Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**. [Summit
meetings]{.underline} between White House and Kremlin leaders, [once
viewed as opportunities for **peace**, are now seen as **dangerous
temptations**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[indulge]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline} [Munich-style **appeasement**]{.underline}, **[the
cardinal sin of statecraft]{.underline}**. American policymakers worry
more about "going wobbly," as Margaret Thatcher once put it, than about
a march of folly into inadvertent war. President Donald Trump's
suggestion that the United States and Russia might explore ways to
manage their differences diplomatically has produced mostly
head-scratching and condemnation.

In my more than 25 years of government experience working on Russia
matters, I've seen that three [misguided assumptions underlie how the
United States got to this point.]{.underline}

The first is that [American [policymakers **think**]{.mark} that
[because **neither side wants**]{.mark} **[nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [then [such a war is]{.mark} very
**[unlikely]{.mark} to occur**]{.underline}. [[Russia would be
**foolish**]{.underline},]{.mark} **[we reason]{.underline}**,
[[to]{.underline} **[cross]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[swords]{.underline}** [with [the]{.mark} **powerful [U.S. military
]{.mark}**[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**risk**]{.mark} its own
**[self-destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and many Americans [find
it]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[hard to imagine]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline}]{.mark} [modern **[cyber
duels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[proxy battles]{.underline}**,
**[information operations]{.underline}** and economic warfare
[[might]{.mark} somehow [**erupt** into **direct nuclear
attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If the Cold War ended peacefully, the
thinking goes, why should America worry that a new shadow war with a
much less formidable Russia will end any differently?

**[[But wars do not]{.mark} [always begin by
design]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as they did in 1914, a vicious
circle of clashing geopolitical ambitions, distorted perceptions of each
other's intent, new and poorly understood technologies, and disappearing
rules of the game could combine to produce a disaster that neither side
wants nor expects.

In fact, **[[cyber technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, artificial
intelligence, advanced hypersonic weapons delivery systems and
antisatellite weaponry [are making the U.S.-Russian shadow war much more
**complex**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[dangerous]{.underline}**
[than the old Cold War competition]{.underline}. [They [are
**blurring**]{.mark} **traditional [lines]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[between]{.underline} **[espionage]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[fare]{.underline}**,
**[[entangling]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[nuclear and conventional
weaponry]{.underline}, [and **erasing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [old
**[distinctions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[between **offensive** and
**defensive**]{.underline}
[op]{.underline}]{.mark}[eration[s]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Whereas the development of nuclear weaponry in the Cold War produced the
concept of mutually assured destruction and had a restraining effect,
[in the cyber arena, playing offense is increasingly seen as the best
defense]{.underline}. And in a highly connected world in which financial
networks, commercial operations, media platforms, and nuclear command
and control systems are all linked in some way, escalation from the
cyber world into the physical domain is a serious danger.

[Cyber technology is also magnifying fears of our adversaries'
**strategic intentions**]{.underline} while prompting questions about
whether warning systems can detect incoming attacks and whether weapons
will fire when buttons are pushed. [This makes containing a crisis that
might arise between U.S. and Russian forces over
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, Iran or anything else much **[more
difficult]{.underline}**. [It is [**not hard** to imagine
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[crisis scenario]{.underline}** [in which
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [cyber operators [**gain access** to a
sa]{.mark}tellite system th[at controls both]{.mark} U.S.
[**conventional** and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[nuclear]{.underline}**
[weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} [systems, [leaving]{.mark} [the American
side **uncertain**]{.mark} about [whether the intrusion is meant
to]{.mark} **gather information** about U.S. war preparations or to
**[disable our]{.mark} ability to conduct [nuclear strikes]{.mark}.**
This [could cause]{.mark} the U.S. president to wonder whether he faces
[a]{.mark}n urgent **["use it or lose it"]{.mark} nuclear launch
[decision]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It doesn't help that the lines of
communication between the United States and Russia necessary for
managing such situations are all but severed.

[A related, second assumption American [policymakers]{.mark} make is
[see]{.mark}ing [the Russian threat as]{.mark} primarily [a **deterrence
problem**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The logic goes]{.underline} something
like this: [Wars often happen because the states that start them believe
they can win, but the United States can **disabuse**]{.underline} [a
**would-be aggressor** of this belief through a]{.underline} **[show of
force]{.underline}**, [thus]{.underline} [deterring
conflict]{.underline}. Indeed, [Washington seems
**convinced**]{.underline} [that showing the Kremlin it will **punish**
Russian transgressions]{.underline}---through toughened economic
sanctions, an enhanced military posture in Europe and more aggressive
cyber operations---[is the **best path** to preserving
peace.]{.underline}

**[But]{.underline}**, [[when dealing with states that **believe they
are under**]{.mark} **some form of [assault]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[focusing on [deterrence can]{.mark} be
**counterproductive**]{.underline}. [Rather than **averting
aggression**]{.underline} by demonstrating the will to fight back,
[America might be unintentionally]{.underline} **[[increas]{.mark}ing
[the odds of a war]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To a great degree, this is
the situation the United States already faces. [[Years of
**enlargement** of **NATO** and]{.mark} **[perceived U.S.
involvement]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in Russia's internal
affairs]{.mark} have [convinced the Kremlin]{.mark} that [America
poses]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[an existential
threat]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[In turn]{.underline}**, [[Russia's
meddling]{.mark} in the 2016 U.S. presidential election]{.underline},
coupled with a string of aggressions against its neighbors, [have
**[convinced Washington]{.mark}** that [Moscow is **going for the**
]{.mark}**West's [jugular]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[The United States [experienced this **spiral phenomenon** with
**Georgia**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in 2008.]{.underline} Convinced that
Russia harbored aggressive designs on its southern neighbor, [Washington
policymakers **[accelerated U.S. military
training]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in Georgia]{.underline}, openly
advocated bringing Tbilisi into the NATO alliance and issued multiple
warnings to Moscow against military action, [believing this firm resolve
would deter Russian aggression]{.underline}. [In fact, it [had]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[opposite effect]{.underline}**. [Russia
grew]{.underline}]{.mark} **[increasingly
[alarmed]{.mark}]{.underline}** [by the prospect of Georgian membership
in NATO]{.underline}, while Tbilisi felt emboldened to launch a military
operation in the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia, [which
[yielded]{.mark} an **immediate** and **[massive]{.mark}** **Russian
[military response.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Russia War Terminals

#### U.S.-Russia nuclear war outweighs

Sebastian **[Farquhar 17]{.underline}**, leads the Global Priorities
Project (GPP) at the Centre for Effective Altruism, et al., 2017,
"Existential Risk: Diplomacy and Governance,"
https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Existential-Risks-2017-01-23.pdf

The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated the unprecedented
destructive power of nuclear weapons. However, [even [in a]{.mark}n
all-out [nuclear war between the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite
horrific casualties, [[neither]{.mark} country's population [is]{.mark}
[likely to be]{.mark} completely [destroyed **by** ]{.mark}**the [direct
effects]{.mark} of the blast**]{.underline}, fire, and radiation.8 [The
[aftermath could be **much worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}: the
[[burning]{.underline}]{.mark} of [flammable materials [could
send]{.mark} massive amounts of [smoke into the
atmosphere]{.mark}]{.underline}, which would absorb sunlight and
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} sustained global cooling, severe ozone
loss, and agricultural disruption -- **[[a nuclear
winter]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

According to one model 9 , [an all-out [exchange of 4,000
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}10 [[could lead to]{.mark} a [drop
in]{.mark} global [temp]{.mark}erature[s of]{.mark} around [8°C,]{.mark}
[making it **impossible to grow food**]{.mark} **for**]{.underline} 4 to
[**5 years**. This could leave some survivors]{.underline} in parts of
Australia and New Zealand, [but they would be in a very precarious
situation and the **[threat of extinction]{.mark} from other sources
[would be great]{.mark}**. An [exchange on this scale is **only possible
between the US and Russia** who have]{.mark} more than [**90%** of the
world's nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}, with stockpiles of around
4,500 warheads each, although many are not operationally deployed.11
Some models suggest that even [a [small regional nuclear war]{.mark}
[involving]{.mark} [100]{.mark} nuclear [weapons]{.mark}
would]{.underline} produce a nuclear winter serious enough to [put two
billion]{.underline} people [at risk]{.underline} of starvation,12
[though this]{.underline} estimate **[might be
pessimistic]{.underline}**.13 [Wars on this scale [are **unlikely to
lead to**]{.mark}]{.underline} outright **[human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but this does suggest that conflicts
which are around an order of magnitude larger may be likely to threaten
civilisation. It should be emphasised that there is very large
uncertainty about the effects of a large nuclear war on global climate.
This remains an area where increased academic research work, including
more detailed climate modelling and a better understanding of how
survivors might be able to cope and adapt, would have high returns.

### Ext \-\-- Hybrid War Impacts \-\-- Populism

#### Russian hybrid tactics support populist movements

University of Denver, Summer 2020, "American Grand Strategy for an
Emerging World Order,"
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-14_Issue-2/Lawless.pdf

[[The liberal order faces]{.underline}]{.mark} [political challenges
that involve **[unconventional political warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[to weaken democratic regimes]{.underline}]{.mark} as well as a "clash
of social models" between liberal and neo-authoritarian states.16
Political warfare "refers to the employment of military, intelligence,
diplomatic, financial, and other means short of conventional war to
achieve national objectives."17 [Its current "[hybrid]{.mark}"
adaptation is unconventional in that it involves [tactics]{.mark} such
as the weaponization of traditional and social media, sophisticated
propaganda, and the widespread use of disinformation campaigns to sway
public opinion, **[discredit liberal politicians]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[and **sow distrust for democratic institutions**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
actively "[[exploit\[ing\] European and transatlantic fissures and
**support\[ing\] populist movements** to undermine]{.mark}
**[E]{.mark}**uropean **[U]{.mark}**nion [and NATO
cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}."18 Meanwhile, China is targeting the
United States' companies, government, and allies as part of its ongoing
cyber-espionage campaign to steal trade secrets, intellectual property,
and advanced technology. What's more, the political order is
experiencing a clash of social models in which states such as Russia and
China "believe in the virtues of a strong central government and disdain
the weaknesses of the democratic system."19 Thus, collective political
convergence has never been realized because autocratic leaders
"concluded that if the liberal order succeeded globally, it would pose
an existential threat to their regimes."20

[Populism has never been so scrutinized]{.underline}, analyzed, and
questioned. [One aspect of populism]{.underline}, however[, remains less
studied: its impact on countries' **foreign policies**]{.underline} [and
on their **interstate relations**]{.underline} [in an **international
system** in **flux**]{.underline}. There is no single "populist foreign
policy," but [[populism **impacts foreign policies**]{.mark}: It holds a
**particular vision** of **international relations**, a vision that
**carries increasing weight** amid today's **tumultuous attempts** to
**redefine the international system.**]{.underline}

In this article, we [consider populism]{.underline} not just as a
rhetorical expression of protest, but [as a political
project]{.underline}, both illustrating and [**responding to a crisis of
politics** within contemporary democracies]{.underline} --- in short, as
a phenomenon carrying a political vision. We [view populism in foreign
policy as offering an alternative view of international relations, one
that articulates the main **criticism** of the **contemporary
international system**]{.underline}, its **[institutions]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} its **[operating rules]{.underline}** --- what is
[commonly referred to as the "**liberal international
order."**]{.underline} In this sense, populism in foreign policy also
[encompasses]{.underline} **[challenges]{.underline}** [to this order
brought by "**revisionist" states**]{.underline}, [especially Russia and
China.]{.underline}

The recently concluded [**[E]{.mark}**uropean **[P]{.mark}**arliament
[elections]{.mark} **[highlighted]{.mark}** the **[influence of
populists]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [illustrating]{.underline} the
**[fears]{.underline}** [and **anxieties** of many **European
citizens**]{.underline} [in a complicated global environment, but also
their **uncertainty**]{.underline} [about the **role of the European
Union**]{.underline} [in this context]{.underline}. Notably, [although
the European Union and the multilateralism associated with it have
historically been a common target for [populists]{.mark}]{.underline},
[today's populist factions]{.underline} seem to have shifted away from
advocating outright removal from the union. Rather, they [[seem poised
to **sow discord**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.underline}
**[dysfunction]{.underline}** [[in the **E**]{.mark}**uropean
[P]{.mark}arliament**]{.underline} [**[from the inside]{.mark}.** In
this way, the **impact of populism** on the European Union may be **even
more concerning**: The movement [can]{.mark} [affect]{.mark} not only
[the]{.mark} union's **political [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline} [but
[also]{.mark} its]{.underline} **[[functioning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--- [[and]{.mark} ultimately its **overall [relevance]{.mark}** --- [by
**proving**]{.mark} the populists' **major contention** about [the
**bankruptcy of multilateral institutions**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Populism and Foreign Policy: An Alternative Vision of International
Relations

The defining characteristic of [populism]{.underline} is that it
[creates a division between the people and "the system,"]{.underline}
which can also be labeled the elite, bureaucracy, or the "deep state."
Populism can be [defined as a reaction to the crises]{.underline} [of
political representation provoked by globalization]{.underline}, a
reaction opposing the winners of globalization ("the elite") to its
losers, "the people."

[[In foreign policy]{.mark}, this [translates into a]{.mark}
**fundamental [hostility to multilateralism]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
though it does not prevent some populist leaders, such as Hugo Chavez
and Vladimir Putin, from trying to create alternative "nationalist
international movements." The latest illustration is the initiative by
former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who sought to unite all right-wing
populist parties in Europe in a "European Movement." Finally,
anti-Americanism ("anti-imperialism," in several parties' terminology)
characterizes all international populisms, right and left, European,
Iranian, Latin American. America is seen as the ultimate embodiment of
"the system," and as such responsible for the theft of sovereignty from
any given nation or people.

The United States figures prominently in the history of populism as the
first country to have had a "Populist Party" or "People's Party."
Historian Walter Russell Mead has linked the populism of the Tea Party
to what he famously identified as the Jacksonian tradition, offering a
more sophisticated portrayal of contemporary American populism and its
consequences for foreign policy. This vision is characterized by its
nationalism, defined in this case as unilateralism; militarism (which is
not synonymous with interventionism); and hostility to multilateralism,
the United Nations, free trade, and, more broadly, the American role of
guarantor of the postwar international order. This Jacksonian populism
defends a Westphalian vision of the world, in which nation-states enjoy
full sovereignty, and rejects the role of the United States as "world
policeman."

The populist phenomenon affects all continents, but doesn't produce the
same results in terms of foreign policy. One example is Narendra Modi,
the Indian prime minister who was just re-elected in a landslide. Modi
is a populist who, like U.S. President Donald Trump, uses Twitter as a
communication tool to create the illusion of a new modern direct
democracy, but has pursued a traditional agenda for Indian foreign
policy. In the United States and Europe, by contrast, populists, even
when not in power, have affected not only the agenda but also the
content of foreign policies. There is a transatlantic specificity, due
to the power of the United States, the role of Russia, and exchanges
between right-wing populists on both sides of the Atlantic. The result
has been the emergence of "multipolarity without multilateralism, where
the plurality of global players do not imply any kind of collective and
cooperative agenda."Still, most "populist foreign policies" express
concern about eroding sovereignty and a willingness to affirm the
demands of the people and the national interests of the state outside of
established processes of global governance. Contemporary populism is
thus not only a reaction to difficult economic times, but also expresses
the fear of loss of control over national destinies --- the tendency of
state apparatuses to forgo popular control to reach international
agreements.

[European populism **typifies**]{.underline} this [fear of **loss of
control** over **national destinies**. The leitmotif of most populist
parties in Europe aims at "**taking back control**:" control of
**borders**, control of **economy**, control of **culture** and
**identity**,]{.underline} [combined with the persistent idea that the
**elites**,]{.underline} both national and European (the so-called
"bureaucrats from Brussels"), [have]{.underline} **[stolen "the people's
sovereignty]{.underline}**." "Taking Back Control" had been the motto of
the Brexit Campaign in 2016 and, significantly, was taken up by Theresa
May in her major speeches after the referendum.

[Populists in Europe want the return of **borders**]{.underline},
[closed to immigration]{.underline} in particular [but also
to]{.underline} the [flow of **free trade**]{.underline}. They tend to
be hostile to all forms of **[multilateralism]{.underline}**, as showed
by an excellent study by the European Council on Foreign Relations on
"the world according to Europe's insurgent parties." Recent developments
point to an increased convergence in populist proposals from both ends
of the political spectrum. Notably, on immigration, left-wing populists
have made a sharp departure from the universalist ideals that until
recently characterized their project: See, for instance, the evolution
of left-wing populist parties in Italy (Movimiento 5 Stelle), Germany
(Aufstehen), and France (France Insoumise). A comparison between the
French far-right and far-left votes in the European Parliament on issues
related to international trade is telling: On the ratification on CETA
(the trade agreement between the European Union and Canada), or on TIPP
(the trade agreement with the United States), the right-wing
"Rassemblement National" and the left-wing "Front de Gauche" voted on
the same line, illustrating both sides' rejection of free trade.

The rise of populism has changed the terms of the European debate on
major issues --- in this way, populists already influence policies,
including at the center. One example is French President Emmanuel
Macron's proposals in favor of a "Europe that unites to protect." Macron
has understood that the European Union is increasingly viewed as a
machine to deregulate, open borders, enhance competition among states
and individuals and --- especially --- erode national sovereignties.
According to him, the best way to combat this perception is to
demonstrate that the E.U. level is the relevant level to protect
European citizens, far more than the national one. Accordingly, his
project focuses on the concept of "European Sovereignty;" that is, the
capacity to act as a global player and to promote the interests of
member states more efficiently at the European level than at the
individual country level.

Populists and the European Parliament: A Tipping Point?

[Most European populists **don't want to kill the European Union**
anymo]{.underline}re. This has perhaps been the most concrete
consequence of [Brexit]{.underline}, which [has made exiting the body
much less appealing]{.underline}. In the recent European Parliament
election, not a single party put exiting the European Union at the top
of its priority list. **[Rather]{.underline}**, [the major European
populist parties,]{.underline} from France to Italy to Hungary, [now
want to use their power in the new]{.underline} [European Parliament to
**transform the European Union from the inside**]{.underline}. The
feasibility of such an endeavor is, of course, questionable, given how
much the agendas of the various countries' populist parties differ,
especially on migration and fiscal issues.

The key outcome of the election was not necessarily a populist surge but
the decline of the center-left and center-right parties, in the context
of a huge rise in voter participation (over 50 percent, compared to 43
percent in the previous 2014 election). The center-left party S&D (Group
of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats) got 150 seats
(down from 187), the center-right party European People's Party (or
Christian Democrats) 179 (down from 216). The populist forces (whose
political group is still in the process of being created) will hold 73
seats, and 102 if we include the United Kingdom's Brexit party, which
received fewer votes than expected. In this context, the role of
"kingmaker" will be probably played by a new centrist coalition
aggregating the liberal votes of ALDE (Alliance of Liberals and
Democrats for Europe) and those of Macron's "Renaissance" list (up to
107 seats). But, like the populist forces, this new centrist coalition
will be divided on key issues such as budgetary discipline. Defining an
operational political platform among this group's members could be
highly problematic.

In a [nutshell, the [parliament]{.mark} emerging from the elections
[is]{.mark} more [**fragmented** and **less likely** to
**build**]{.mark} **stable [coalitions]{.mark}** than
before]{.underline} --- [even if two-thirds of the seats ultimately went
to pro-European parties]{.underline}. We can expect lengthy discussions
among the factions over the nomination of the European Commission
president, who is supposed to be from the party that obtained the
largest number of votes. If the EPP and the S&D agreed with this rule,
the centrists of ALDE and Macron's list firmly oppose it. In the longer
term and particularly when it comes to foreign policy, some ad hoc
coalitions on specific issues, like trade agreements and commercial
policy more generally, could be expected. Still, if the rise in voter
turnout is good news for European democracy, the volatility of
coalitions is less welcome news for European foreign policy and for the
European Union's capacity to act as a global player.

[The major risk is]{.underline} probably of **[stalling]{.underline}**
[E.U. policymaking by **[blocking]{.mark} the possibility of
[compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that is at the heart of any E.U.
policy.]{.underline} [That [would risk]{.mark} further **strengthening
nationalist governments**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[further]{.underline} [**[undermining]{.mark}** European citizens'
**[confidence in]{.mark} [European institutions]{.mark},** by
**proving** their major talking point: that the European Union is **an
inefficient bureaucracy**]{.underline} [unable to protect
them]{.underline}. Thus, [the most dangerous outcome of populist
influence in the European Parliament is that the [E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion [will become]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[paralyzed]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[[irrelevant]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[on the **international
scene**]{.underline}]{.mark}, assuming the European populists are not
able to develop a coherent project aimed at founding an alternative
European Union. [If the E.U. decision-making process is
paralyzed]{.underline}, [it [will **stall the**]{.mark} **union's
historical [role in multilateral forums]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [further undermine confidence in the European
project]{.underline}. [The very **[relevance of the E]{.mark}uropean
[U]{.mark}nion**]{.underline} -- [[and]{.mark} of
**[multilateralism]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a way of enacting policy
change --- **[[is at stake.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

annihilate the entire planet. But almost no one disputes that [[a
**meteorite**]{.mark} crashing into Earth could do so]{.underline} by
suddenly and drastically altering the climate. Furthermore, [experts
also agree that still **[more deadly
pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline}---viruses and bacteria---[[could
pose]{.underline}]{.mark} such [an [existential
risk.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But [what is currently missing]{.underline} in international law [is an
**adequate mechanism**]{.underline} [to [compel nations to
**cooperate**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **minimize**]{.mark} or
**mitigate** the **[harms]{.mark} from existential risks.**]{.underline}
In addition to efforts to strengthen national regulation of research and
technology risks, [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[need]{.mark}
to pursue the]{.underline} adoption of a [**[multilateral
agreement]{.underline}** [to **address existential
risks**]{.underline}]{.mark} while separately working to insert
existential risk clauses in existing international agreements.

[The fact that [some]{.mark} human-made [existential risks,]{.mark} and
even natural existential risks, [might be **minimized by human
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [makes **prudent**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the development of new [international law]{.mark} aimed at addressing
those risks]{.underline}. Admittedly, some of these risks are more
amenable to national policy than others. [The [consequences of
existential risks are]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [**[by necessity
global]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [therefore **[demand a
global policy response]{.mark}**. Hubs of such international
coordination exist for some risks,]{.underline} such as the World Health
Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the United
Nations's Office for Disarmament Affairs. [Unfortunately,
these]{.underline} international [agencies often lack]{.underline}
[sufficient power and scope to respond effectively to existential
risks.]{.underline}

[Governments]{.underline} around the world [should give particular focus
to developing **stronger international policies**]{.underline} [on
urgent existential risks.]{.underline} I define a risk as "urgent" if
the cost of reducing the risk or strengthening resilience increases
rapidly over time, or if the risk is about to become unmanageable
altogether. One risk that fits that description is climate change, even
though its character as existential risk has been contested.

["Hybrid" scenarios: trigger for conflict?]{.underline}

[[One can envisage]{.mark} a number of "**[hybrid" scenarios]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Russia-NATO conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[where operations]{.mark} which started in the **cyber**]{.underline},
**[economic]{.underline}**, **[criminal]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline}
"**[active measure"]{.underline}** [domains]{.underline}, **[below the
threshold of conflict]{.underline}**, [[trigger a **military
response**]{.underline}]{.mark} [or are followed by the **physical use
of force.**]{.underline} As noted in the discussion on the definitions
of a conflict, [the [**threshold** between **crisis** and]{.mark}
military [**conflict** may not be]{.mark} **explicitly
stated**]{.underline} [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} otherwise
**[[clear]{.mark} to all sides]{.underline}**; [and it [may]{.mark} also
[be **ignored** during a crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This aspect is
especially relevant in the current period of **increased interference**
in the internal affairs of NATO countries attributed to Russia and of
the **high volume of information 'warfare'** between Russia and NATO
countries.]{.underline}

Russia remains vigilant about foreign interference in its internal
affairs and the threat of subversion leading to a severe destabilization
of the regime. In the past, Moscow has made accusations about foreign
sponsorship of Chechen and radical Islamic terrorists targeting Russia,
and has alleged the existence of training camps on the territories of
NATO states for activists planning colour revolutions in Ukraine and
Belarus. In the extreme circumstances of a crisis, [if]{.underline} the
[Russian leadership became convinced that a non-military campaign
against it]{.underline} (which might also involve cyber activities and
what Russia calls attempts to instigate colour revolutions) [had
intensified, this could lead to a **military response.**]{.underline}

[With regards to NATO, [some]{.mark} of its [members' view]{.mark}s
mirror the Russian assessment that [we are **already in** ]{.mark}**a
state of [conflict,]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[in which the
**boundary** between **peace** and **war** is **blurred**]{.underline},
[and that their defences are being **actively attacked**]{.underline}
[through **nonmilitary means.**]{.underline} [[They are]{.mark} thus
[concerned about a scenario in which Russia]{.mark} **initiates an
attack**]{.underline} [that [moves **swiftly**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[from **non-military to military means**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
scenario should be not dismissed. At the same time, one needs to be wary
of interpreting all disturbing developments as part of a grand Russian
plan culminating in a provocation or use of force. So [[there should be
**prudence** before any country **presses the "panic
button"**]{.underline} [at]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the]{.underline}
national or [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} / European Union
[level]{.underline}. There should also be close analysis of early
warning indicators related to the gravity, intensity and diversity of
incidents and to connections between them. The overall political context
and state of the RussiaNATO relationship would also be important: what
would be the political and strategic reasons for Russia to move from
sub-threshold to abovethreshold activities?

**[Escalation]{.underline}**: [Can a NATO - Russia conflict be
**managed**?]{.underline}

[[Once a conflict was under way, the **"fog of war"**]{.mark} and
**rising unpredictability** [would]{.mark} **inevitably [set
in]{.mark}**, [complicating]{.mark} the implementation of any
[**predetermined theories** of]{.mark} **escalation**,
**[deescalation]{.mark}** and **inter-conflict management**. The
**[actual dynamics]{.mark}** of a conflict [and]{.mark} the
**[perceptions of]{.mark} the [stakes]{.mark}**]{.underline} [involved
[are]{.mark} extremely **[difficult to predict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Simulations and table-top exercises can give only limited insights into
the actual decisionmaking processes and interactions.

Still, [[Russian]{.mark} [military theorists]{.mark} and practitioners
seem to [assume]{.mark} that a [conflict with NATO can be
**managed**]{.mark} and controlled in a way that would bring it to a
swift end consistent with Russian aims.]{.underline} The Russian theory
of victory would seek to exploit weak points in an Alliance war effort.
[Based on the conviction that democracies are weak and their leaders and
populations are risk-averse, Russia [may assume]{.mark} that [its
threats of]{.mark} horizontal or [**vertical escalation** could
be]{.mark} particularly **[effective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It would
also try to bring home the notion that it has much higher stakes in the
conflict (regime survival) than a majority of the NATO members involved,
and thus will be ready to push the boundaries of the conflict further.
It [[would]{.mark} most likely [try to]{.mark} **[test]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[exploit]{.mark}** potential **[divisions]{.mark} within
the Alliance**]{.underline}, combining selective diplomacy and
activation of its intelligence assets in some NATO states with a degree
of selectivity in terms of targets of particular attacks.

[[Any]{.mark} NATO-Russia [conflict would **inevitably have a nuclear
dimension**]{.mark}**.** The role of nuclear weapons [as]{.mark} a
**tool for [escalation control]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[for
Russia]{.mark} has been thoroughly debated]{.underline} by experts, [but
when and how Russia might use]{.underline} (and not merely showcase or
activate) [nuclear weapons in a conflict remains an **open
question**]{.underline}. [Beyond **catch phrases** such as "**escalate
to de-escalate"**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} "**[escalate to
win]{.underline}**" [there are a wider range of options for Russian
nuclear weapon use]{.underline}. For example, [a single nuclear warning
shot could be lethal or non-lethal]{.underline}. It [could be directed
against a purely military target or a military-civilian
one]{.underline}. [Detonation could be configured for an EMP
effect]{.underline}. A "false flag" attack is also conceivable. [These
options might be used]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[signal
escalation]{.underline}** and could significantly complicate NATO's
responses.

Neither NATO nor its member states have developed a similar theory of
victory. Public NATO documents stipulate the general goals for the
Alliance: defend against any armed attack and, as needed, restore the
full sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states. It is less
clear how far the Alliance would be willing to escalate the conflict to
achieve these goals, and what mechanisms and means it would use while
trying to maintain some degree of control over the conflict.

[The goals and methods of waging a conflict with Russia would probably
have to be limited in order to]{.underline} **[avoid a massive nuclear
exchange]{.underline}**. Such limitations would also involve
restrictions on striking back against targets on Russian territory.
[But]{.underline} **[too narrow an approach]{.underline}** [could put
**too much restraint** on NATO's operations: the Russian regime's
**stability** may ultimately need to be **threatened** in order to
**force the leadership into terminating the conflict**]{.underline}.
NATO would thus need to establish what a proportional self-defence
response to Russian actions would involve, and to what extent cyber
operations or attacks against military targets in quite different parts
of Russia would be useful as tools of escalation to signal NATO's
resolve. Moreover, individual NATO Allies, especially those directly
affected by Russia's actions, might pursue their individual strategies
of escalation.

With regards to the nuclear dimension in NATO escalation plans, given
the stakes involved, this element would most likely be handled by the
three nuclear-weapon members of the Alliance, with the US taking the
lead. The existence of three independent centres of nuclear
decision-making could be exploited to complicate Russian planning and
introduce uncertainty into the Russian strategic calculus, but some
degree of "P3" dialogue and coordination would be beneficial. This
coordination would not necessarily focus on nuclear targeting, but
rather on designing coordinated operations to demonstrate resolve in
order to keep the conflict below the nuclear threshold, or bring it back
under the threshold after first use.

[[Relying on concepts of escalation control]{.mark} and on lessons [from
the **Cold War**]{.mark} confrontation [might be
**misleading**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The circumstances in
which a Russia -NATO conflict would play out would be **radically
different**]{.underline} from the 20th century screenplay. Moreover,
[[instead of **gradual**]{.underline}]{.mark} (**[linear]{.underline}**)
[[escalation or **salami tactics**]{.mark} **escalation**]{.underline},
[[it is possible to imagine **surprizing** "**leap frog"
escalation**]{.underline},]{.mark} [possibly [connected with actions in
**different domains**]{.mark}]{.underline} [([e.g. a
**cyberattack**]{.underline}]{.mark} [against]{.underline} [critical
infrastructure]{.underline}). Flexibility, good intelligence and
inventiveness in responding to such developments would be crucial.

Conflict termination

[Russian and NATO [assumptions regarding **conflict termination**
would]{.mark} most **likely [not survive the first hours]{.mark} of an
actual conflict**]{.underline}. [[Both sides are capable of
**underestimating**]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[resolve]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the other side to prevail in a
conflict and the]{.underline} [other side's **willingness** to commit
the necessary resources and endure the costs,]{.underline} [[especially
once both]{.mark} sides **[start committing]{.mark} their [political
capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[resources]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} the **[casualties
accumulate]{.underline}**.

With regards to Russia, Moscow would most likely be approaching the
conflict with a clearer concept of its war aims and thus develop
better-formed views on conflict termination. It would seek to establish
escalation dominance and confront NATO with a binary choice of either
accepting defeat or further intensification of fighting. Such
intensification might involve a move to the nuclear level, but Russia
would also have conventional escalation options, such as conventional
deep strikes.

At the same time, [it should be highlighted that [Russia is unlikely to
start a conflict which involves]{.mark} a high degree of
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} about its final outcome [and carries a
risk of military defeat]{.underline}. Russia cannot safely assume that
US-led NATO would act with restraint, nor could it be sure that the
Alliance would be ready to surrender and terminate a conflict early. For
internal reasons Russia cannot afford to lose a "big war", so the most
prudent option would generally be not to initiate such a conflict in the
first place. [Such [logic]{.mark} [could]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[however]{.underline}**, [**[get lost]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [some of the **[hybrid
scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and scenarios of [an
**inadvertent outbreak**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of a
conflict]{.underline}.

VI\. [[How it would happen]{.underline}]{.mark}: The fog of **[[hybrid
war]{.mark}]{.underline}** In early 2015, Pew pollsters asked citizens
of several NATO states the exact question that analysts and policymakers
from Washington to Moscow are gaming out: \"If Russia got into a serious
military conflict with one of its neighboring countries that is our NATO
ally, do you think our country should or should not use military force
to defend that country?\" The numbers from Western Europe were alarming:
Among Germans, only 38 percent said yes; 58 percent said no. If it were
up to German voters --- and to at least some extent, it is --- NATO
would effectively surrender the Baltics to Russia in a conflict. This
poll is even worse than it looks. It assumes that Russia would launch an
overt military invasion of the Baltics. [What would]{.underline}
actually [happen is]{.underline} something far murkier, and far more
likely to leverage European hesitation: **[the playbook from
Ukraine]{.underline}**, [where Russia deployed its]{.underline} newly
developed concepts of postmodern \"[hybrid war,\" designed to blur the
distinction between war and not-war, to make it as difficult as possible
to differentiate grassroots unrest]{.underline} or vigilante
cyberattacks [from Russian military aggression.]{.underline} Putin may
already be laying the groundwork. In March of 2014, shortly after Russia
had annexed Crimea, Putin gave a speech there pledging to protect
Russians even outside of Russia, which many took as a gesture to the
substantial Russian minorities in the Baltics. Then, in October, Putin
warned that \"open manifestations of neo-Nazism\" had \"become
commonplace in Latvia and other Baltic states\" --- repeating the
language that he and Russian state media had earlier used to frighten
Russian speakers in Ukraine into taking up arms. This April, several
Russian outlets issued spurious reports that Latvia was planning to
forcibly relocate ethnic Russians into Nazi-style ghettos --- an echo of
similar scaremongering Russian propaganda broadcast in the runup in
Ukraine. Martin Hurt, a former senior official of the country\'s defense
ministry, warned that his country\'s ethnic Russian minority could be
\"receptive to Kremlin disinformation.\" Moscow, he said, could generate
unrest \"as a pretext to use military force against the Baltic states.\"
In early 2007, Estonia\'s parliament voted to relocate a Soviet-era
military statue, the Bronze Soldier, that had become a cultural symbol
and annual rallying point for the country\'s ethnic Russians. In
response, Russian politicians and state media accused the Estonian
government of fascism and Nazi-style discrimination against ethnic
Russians; they issued false reports claiming ethnic Russians were being
tortured and murdered. Protests broke out and escalated into riots and
mass looting. One person was killed in the violence, and the next day
hackers took many of the country\'s major institutions offline. [[Russia
could]{.mark} do it again]{.underline}, only [this time gradually
escalating further toward a Ukraine-style conflict]{.underline}.
[NATO]{.underline} is just not built to deal with such a crisis. Its
mutual defense pledge, after all, [rests on the assumption that war is a
black-and-white concept]{.underline}, that a country is either at war or
not at war. [Its charter is from a time when war was very different than
it is today, with its many shades of gray. **Russia can exploit this
flaw**]{.underline} [by introducing low-level violence that more hawkish
NATO members would consider grounds for war but that
war-averse]{.underline} Western [European states might not
see]{.underline} that way. Disagreement among NATO\'s member states
would be guaranteed as they hesitated over where to declare a moment
when Russia had crossed the line into war. [Meanwhile,
Russian]{.underline} state media, which has shown real
[influence]{.underline} in Western Europe, would [[unleash a flurry of
propaganda to confuse the issue]{.underline}]{.mark}, make it harder to
pin blame on Moscow for the violence, and gin up skepticism of any
American calls for war. Germany, which is widely considered the deciding
vote on whether Europe would go to war, would be particularly resistant
to going to war. The legacy of World War II and the ideology of pacifism
and compromise make even the idea of declaring war on Russia
unthinkable. German leaders would come under intense political pressure
to, if not reject the call to arms, then at least delay and negotiate
--- a de facto rejection of NATO\'s collective self-defense. [In such a
scenario]{.underline}, it is disturbingly easy to imagine how [NATO\'s
European member states could split over whether Russia had even crossed
their red line]{.underline} for war, much less whether to respond.
[Under a fog of confusion]{.underline} and doubt, **[[Russia
could]{.mark} gradually [escalate]{.mark}]{.underline}** until a
Ukraine-style conflict [[in the Baltics]{.underline}]{.mark} was
foregone**[, [until it had marched far across NATO\'s red
line]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} exposing that red line as
meaningless. But the greatest danger of all is [if Putin]{.underline}\'s
plan [were to]{.underline} stumble: By **[overreac]{.underline}**hing,
b[y underestimating Western resolve]{.underline} to defend the Baltics,
[or by starting something [that escalates beyond his control**, it
could** ]{.mark}**all too [easily]{.mark} [lead to full-blown
war.]{.mark}**]{.underline} \"[That kind of misperception
situation]{.underline} **[is definitely possible, and [that's how wars
start]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" Saideman said, going on to [compare
Europe today with 1914]{.underline}, just before World War I. \"**[The
thing that makes war most thinkable is when other people don't think
it's thinkable]{.underline}**.\"

also be ignored during a crisis. This aspect is especially relevant in
the current period of increased interference in the internal affairs of

countries would have a decisive role in how some of the "hybrid"
scenarios would play out. An Ally can choose to play down or up the
importance of certain developments and incidents; it can seek NATO
and/or EU support, decide to respond individually (including through
actions that are escalatory), or use a mix of both approaches. The
Ally's overall reputation and patterns of international behaviour can
matter for determining whether its "frontline" intelligence and
assessments are to be trusted. But given the danger of alliance
entrapment, NATO also needs to have multiple channels for corroborating
the evidence and assessing developments. Escalation: Can a NATO - Russia
conflict be managed? [[Once a conflict was under way, the "fog of war"
and rising unpredictability would]{.underline} **[inevitably set
in]{.underline}**, [complicating]{.underline}]{.mark} [the

Various [U.S. military branches]{.underline} also [recognize the
importance of the Baltic to emerging U.S. national security
interests,]{.underline} with this being reflected in their analyses of
European geopolitical trends since 2014. A 2016 compilation published by
National Defense University Press noted that [[Russia]{.mark}n leaders
[could engage]{.mark}]{.underline} in military intervention [[to]{.mark}
"[protect]{.mark}" Russian [minorities in]{.mark} neighboring states
such as [the Baltics]{.mark}]{.underline}, that Russian territorial
seizure of territory in the Baltics [[would impose a]{.mark} military
[escalation burden]{.mark} on the United **States [including using
nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that NATO countries must strike
a delicate balance between reassuring Baltic allies and deterring
Russian miscalculation while also calming tensions, and noting that
Russia has recently deployed short-range SS-26 Iskander ballistic
missiles to Kaliningrad adjacent to the Baltics. This work asserted that
Russian attempts to destabilize the Baltics with a Crimean variant
hybrid operation could result in NATO's Article 5 being invoked, that
Russia could overrun the Baltic countries within 48-72 hours but with
the price of prompting a NATO response that Moscow could not maintain
and shake Finnish and Swedish neutrality, that NATO battalions should
have forward-based ground units possessing short-range air defense
capability and the ability to eliminate offensive Russian military
action from Putin's strategic calculus, that Russian air defenses at
Kaliningrad, Severomorsk, and St. Petersburg cover airspace encompassing
and endangering Finland, the Baltic States, northern and southern
Sweden, northern Norway, Poland, and eastern Germany, and the belief of

[[A once-in-a-century pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[potential to unleash an **epochal
geopolitical churn**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[There are **major
risks**]{.mark} [from]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [[conflict
triggered by tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[or from a conflict of interests between the US and Russia in the
Mid]{.underline}]{.mark}dle [[East]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Iran might
exacerbate existing tensions by moving]{.mark}]{.underline} perceptibly
[[closer towards a nuclear weapon]{.underline}]{.mark}s capability [[or
by activating]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[proxies as a response to
extreme stress from]{.underline}]{.mark} the sanctions and [[the
pandemic. Such a conflict might draw in the US and
Israel,]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[leading to a wider
conflagration]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

As the demonstrations in the US are echoed other countries, there will
likely be different outcomes, depending upon the nature of the political
system in place. [[Democracies are less likely to use force and more
likely to introduce changes to address underlying
causes]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Authoritarian regimes, which suffer from
a crisis of legitimacy,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[are more likely to use
excessive force and less likely to address underlying
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}, out of a fear of unleashing a chain of
events they would be unable to control.

when there is no cop on the beat.]{.underline}**

**[[American leadership begins at home]{.mark}, right

[because they]{.underline} are not constrained by the balance of powers,

Given these trends, the Community of Democracies has a new imperative:
to demonstrate to itself and to the world that [the]{.underline} core
[values of [democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and human rights
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} not only goods in and of themselves, but also
[[the most promising path to]{.underline}
**[peace]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[and security]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[in a]{.mark}n increasingly [turbulent world]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
report we present here to their representatives and to all engaged
citizens from civil society, parliaments, businesses, and youth seeks to
show that [the [norms and practices of liberal]{.mark}
[democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and human rights [do]{.underline} in
fact [[lead to better]{.underline} [security]{.underline}]{.mark}
[outcomes]{.underline} [[over time]{.mark} and [across multiple
dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[Based on a]{.underline} year-long [research project]{.underline}
[gathering]{.underline} the **[[empirical
evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the relationship between democracy
and security, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} on **[[accumulated
experience]{.underline}]{.mark}** with combating the scourge of
extremist violence and terrorism, we can say with confidence that
[liberal democracy]{.underline}, **[when allowed to consolidate and
flourish]{.underline}**, [is the best path toward achieving]{.underline}
[domestic and international peace and security.]{.underline} A series of
policy briefs covering a range of security-related issues from civil war
to digital technology were commissioned by the Community of Democracies'
Permanent Secretariat and prepared by the Brookings Institution's
Foreign Policy Program and the Institute for Security Studies.1 [This
research]{.underline}, which was [complemented]{.underline} [by
consultations with policymakers, academic experts, and
civil]{.underline} [society]{.underline} [during]{.underline} [workshops
held in India, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Poland, Sweden, and the
United States, examines these linkages in substantial
detail]{.underline}.

[The evidence [affirms]{.mark} [the]{.mark} standard
[observation]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[democracies do not go to
war]{.mark} [against one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But the
[data]{.underline} [also prove]{.underline} that [democracies are [less
likely to spawn **internal armed**]{.mark}
**[conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[experience
deadly terrorism]{.underline}** [[because they]{.mark} channel dissent
through]{.underline} [nonviolent means]{.underline} [and [manage
violence through]{.mark}]{.underline} respect for the **[[rule of
law]{.underline}]{.mark}** and human rights. Authoritarian and failed
states, on the other hand, are more likely to experience intra and
interstate conflict, generate refugees, hinder women's equality, and
harbor violent extremists.

The research also shows that [states at [intermediate stages]{.mark} of
democratization]{.underline}---hybrid regimes with mixed features of
democracy and autocracy, elite-driven patronage systems, and/or weak
institutions---[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} generally the **[[most
vulnerable]{.mark} to insecurity]{.underline}**, whether from violent
crime, terrorism, or entrenched poverty. These are [states where there
is]{.underline} both [[weak]{.underline}]{.mark} [institutional
[capacity and]{.mark}]{.underline} [weak political
[legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} together
contribute to a [[breakdown]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[the]{.mark}
[social contract]{.mark} between citizens and]{.underline} the
[government]{.underline}. This report argues that [to foster domestic
and international security]{.underline}, and to address the underlying
drivers of violent extremism, [[this]{.underline}]{.mark} social
contract [[must be repaired]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is essential,
therefore, [to adopt strategies [to
institutionalize]{.mark}]{.underline} **[democratic
governance]{.underline}**, **[[inclusive
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and human rights in fragile states.
**[Civil society]{.underline}**---as independent participants, monitors,
and critics of our democratic institutions---are also
[[critical]{.underline}]{.mark} [ingredients]{.underline}
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} any strategy for [[peace]{.underline}.]{.mark}

#### Democratic consolidation solves inter and intra-state [escalation]{.underline} and [miscalc]{.underline}

**[Albright 17]{.underline}** \[Madeline Albright, currently a professor

Scholars and practitioners of diplomacy and international relations have
long considered the proposition, articulated by theorists like Immanuel
Kant, that [[societies governed]{.underline}
[democratically]{.underline}]{.mark} [are more inclined to **[avoid
armed conflict with]{.mark} [each other]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[accumulated [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, [[remains
strong]{.underline}]{.mark} [that]{.underline} **[[established
liberal]{.mark} [democracies]{.mark} [do not go to war]{.mark} against
each other]{.underline}**. Leaders accustomed to the negotiated
trade-offs of shared power and accountable to citizens through free,
fair, and periodic elections, embedded in constitutional systems with
independent judiciaries, free media, and civilian control of the
military, have built-in checks against belligerence toward similar
liberal democratic countries. [[Healthy]{.mark} [democracies]{.mark}
[are better at]{.mark}]{.underline} **[credibly [signaling]{.mark} their
[intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}** to their citizens and to other
states. [Such [transparency]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[reduces]{.underline}]{.mark} [the likelihood of]{.underline}
**[[miscalculations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[is more likely to [lead to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[peaceful
[settlements]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[before]{.underline}]{.mark} the
onset of [direct military [conflict]{.mark}.]{.underline} At least in
the realm of interstate conflict, [the empirical record
suggests]{.underline} that a world of stronger [democracies]{.underline}
[will be more peaceful]{.underline}.

With the decline of interstate war over the last many decades,
particularly after the end of the Cold War, the international community
has struggled instead with the persistence of internal armed conflicts
of varying intensities, some of which also have international
dimensions. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, according to the
Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP), the number of civil wars has
increased with a significant uptick since 2010. Notably, 70 conflicts
involving nonstate actors were recorded in 2015, dwarfing the yearly
average of 35 between 1989 and 2015. Similarly, armed conflicts between
governments and rebel groups increased from 41 in 2014 to 50 in
2015---making it the second highest tally since 52 were recorded in
1991. [Factors contributing to internal]{.underline}
[conflict]{.underline}, including defining elements of democracy and
human rights such as elections and political repression, [are complex
and diverse]{.underline}. The [historical record shows,
however]{.underline}, that [[countries with]{.mark}
[strong]{.mark}]{.underline} [records of [respect for
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} and human rights [[are]{.mark} **[far
less likely]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to experience]{.mark} [civil
wars]{.mark}]{.underline} [than hybrid regimes]{.underline}.2

Stronger democracies are less prone to civil war for at least two
reasons. [First]{.underline}, at the elite level, healthy democratic
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} [and regular]{.underline} [electoral
processes]{.underline} [[create]{.mark} [incentives
for]{.mark}]{.underline} [political [participation]{.mark}]{.underline}
by a wide range of ideological actors [[at]{.mark} relatively [low
cost]{.mark}]{.underline}, while [[taking up arms]{.mark}
[involves]{.mark} much [higher costs]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Second]{.underline}, [[rebel groups]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[less likely to find]{.underline} [support]{.underline}]{.mark} [among
citizens]{.underline} [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} popular
[[grievances]{.underline} [are]{.underline}]{.mark} [being [met
through]{.mark}]{.underline} peaceful and credible [[political
processes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Strong autocracies also tend to avoid
civil wars because of the repression and cooptation employed by their
state institutions.

#### [Democracy]{.underline} solves WMD conflict

"Unconventional Wisdom -- Democracy is Still Worth Fighting For",
Foreign Policy, January / February,
<http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/01/02/unconventional_wisdom?page=0,11>)

[As the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[struggles to wind down two wars and recover from a humbling financial
crisis, realism is enjoying a renaissance.]{.underline} Afghanistan and
Iraq bear scant resemblance to the democracies we were promised. The
Treasury is broke. And America has a president, Barack Obama, who once
compared his foreign-policy philosophy to the realism of theologian
Reinhold Niebuhr: \"There\'s serious evil in the world, and hardship and
pain,\" Obama said during his 2008 campaign. \"And we should be humble
and modest in our belief we can eliminate those things.\" But one can
take such words of wisdom to the extreme-as realists like former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and writer Robert Kaplan sometimes
do, arguing that the United States can\'t afford the risks inherent in
supporting democracy and human rights around the world. Others, such as
cultural historian Jacques Barzun, go even further, saying that America
can\'t export democracy at all, \"because it is not an ideology but a
wayward historical development.\" Taken too far, such realist absolutism
can be just as dangerous, and wrong, as neoconservative hubris. For
there is one thing the neocons get right: As I argue in *The Democracy
Advantage*, [[democratic governments are more likely]{.mark} than
autocratic regimes [to]{.mark} engage in conduct that advances U.S.
interests and [avoid]{.mark}s situations that pose [a **threat to peace
and security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Democratic states are more likely
to [develop and]{.mark} to [avoid **famines**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
economic collapse. [[They are]{.mark} also [less likely to become
**failed**]{.mark} **states** [or suffer]{.mark} a]{.underline}
**[[civil war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Democratic states]{.mark} are
also more likely to [cooperate]{.mark} in dealing [with]{.mark} security
issues, such as **[terror]{.mark}ism** [and **prolif**]{.mark}**eration
of w**]{.underline}eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction. As the bloody aftermath of the Iraq
invasion painfully shows, [[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} cannot be
imposed from the outside by force or coercion. It [[must come
from]{.underline}]{.mark} the people of a [nation working to get on the
path of democracy and then]{.underline} **[[adopting]{.mark} the
[policies necessary]{.mark} to remain on that path]{.underline}**. But
we should be careful about overlearning the lessons of Iraq. In fact,
[[the outside world can make an **enormous difference** in]{.mark}
whether [such efforts]{.mark} **succeed**]{.underline}. [There are
numerous examples]{.underline}-starting with Spain and Portugal and
spreading to Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia-in [which the
struggle to establish democracy]{.underline} and advance human rights
[received]{.underline} **[critical support]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} multilateral bodies, including the United Nations, as
well as from regional organizations, [democratic
governments]{.underline}, and private groups. It is very much in
America\'s interest to provide such assistance now to new democracies,
such as Indonesia, Liberia, and Nepal, and to stand with those
advocating democracy in countries such as Belarus, Burma, and China. It
will still be true that the United States will sometimes need to work
with a nondemocratic regime to secure an immediate objective, such as
use of a military base to support the U.S. mission in Afghanistan, or in
the case of Russia, to sign an arms-control treaty. None of that,
however, should come at the expense of speaking out in support of those
struggling for their rights. Nor should we doubt that America would be
more secure if they succeed.

### Ext \-\-- Hybrid War Bad \-\-- Secessionism

#### Russian cyberwar causes [secessionism]{.underline}, undermines [European democracy]{.underline}, and [destroys NATO]{.underline}.

https://realcontextnews.com/the-history-of-russias-cyberwarfare-against-nato-shows-it-is-time-to-add-to-natos-article-5/

The [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} Alliance [[has
served]{.underline}]{.mark} for over seventy years not only [[as a
foundation of preventing armed attacks]{.mark} from Russia and other
major powers]{.underline} against most of Europe and North America, but
also [a foundation of one of the **most peaceful and prosperous eras**
in world history]{.underline}. [[But there is one]{.mark} major [type of
warfare that has been hitting NATO]{.mark} member states
intensely]{.underline} for years [and increasingly so:
[cyberwarfare]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [virtually all cybercampaigns of
this cyberwarfare have been waged by **Russia**]{.underline}, [[part
of]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian President Vladimir Putin's overall [[war
against]{.underline}]{.mark} the West, especially NATO but also even
Western [[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Apart from some Chinese hacking/cyberespionage known to have begun at
least by 2003, the first two serious cyberassaults (in these cases
carried out much more so as part of geopolitical cyberwarfare campaigns)
were Hezbollah's and Israel's surprising cyberattacks against each other
during their 2006 war and Russia's less-surprising but far larger
cybercampaign against NATO-member Estonia in 2007, just three years
after it had joined the Alliance. It was not long after that when it
became clear Russia was absolutely a bad-faith actor with which we have
needed, since the last years of the George W. Bush Administration and
through the Obama and Trump Administrations, to take a much tougher
stance, as I have argued before.

Unsurprisingly, then, the two countries that have led in cyberwarfare
since are Russia and China, the first being the weaker of the two but
also NATO's (and America's) clearest top state enemy and the second
being the overall stronger of the two, but more restrained and America's
clearest top state rival for global power and influence. Though China
has conducted its own massive hacking and espionage operations (not
uncommon among major powers) and has its own influence operations, it is
[Russia]{.underline} that [has]{.underline} without question [been the
dominant aggressor with acts far more hostile than hacking operations
focused mainly on espionage]{.underline}. In fact, [Russia is unique
among major powers]{.underline} in [carrying out significant acts of
hostile cyberwarfare]{.underline} beyond espionage ever since its
Estonia campaign. And while espionage against NATO states is bad for any
of those states, espionage has long been viewed as separate from acts of
war and should remain in a different category from acts of war in all
but the most extreme of cases, a select level in which the latest
Russian cybercampaign (detected to be only espionage so far even if at a
historic level) seems begging to be included.

Since the Estonia campaign, [[Russia become dramatically more
aggressive]{.mark} against NATO]{.underline}, often skillfully
**[[manipulating nationalisms]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as I discussed
recently) [and **[flooding NATO]{.mark} member [states with]{.mark}
cyberwarfare**, with **[election interference and boosting
secessionism]{.mark}** as common features]{.underline}. Notable
cybercampaigns have been directed at the United States, the United
Kingdom (including the Scottish independence and Brexit referenda),
Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Norway,
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Canada, Turkey, Denmark,
Romania, Poland, Slovakia, Montenegro, and even (North) Macedonia,
unsurprisingly focused there on preventing its recent accession to NATO
(and these do not even get into campaigns carried out beyond NATO
territory).

These [cybercampaigns involve thousands of Russian government
paid-trolls and Kremlin-created bots operating thousands of fake
accounts that create millions of Tweets, comments, and
posts.]{.underline} And the way [these operations]{.underline} tend to
work is by [promot]{.underline}ing [politicians and political parties
coopted or compromised]{.underline} by or even favorable to Russia and
Putin's agenda and slamming their opponents or anyone critical of Russia
and willing to stand up to Putin.

Many of the [[parties]{.underline}]{.mark} getting the most help
(including funding) from Russia [[exhibit]{.underline}]{.mark} the same
hackneyed brand of thoroughly boring **[[right-wing
ethnonationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the type embraced by Putin's
own United Russia party, which has in recent years forged alliances with
several major political parties in Europe, including in major NATO
states Italy, Germany, and France (and there are suspicions about the
UK, where details of this remain redacted in the recent British
parliamentary Russia report). Similar political interference efforts are
known to extend beyond NATO countries.

Using its primary hybrid mix of disinformation, hacking, and propaganda,
and with a network that combines top Kremlin figures, shadowy Russian
government operatives, oligarchs in Putin's pocket, and various
state-linked media "outlets," [[these operations have had far more
effect than most people]{.mark} in NATO countries
[realize]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [helping to sway the views of many
millions and dramatically **distorting public
discussion**]{.underline}]{.mark}, politics, and policies in countries
[[on everything from **Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark} (see the Hunter
Biden "story," for years a Russian disinformation campaign) [**[and
Syria to]{.mark} sanctions** and]{.underline} even the current
coronavirus [[pandemic]{.underline}]{.mark}. This model is skilled at
preying on ignorance and confirmation bias to turn media outlets and
citizens alike in these NATO states into Kremlin allies, whether as
unwitting "useful idiots" or witting Fausts. From Donald Trump and
France's Marine Le Pen and Brexit champion Nigel Farage to Fox News'
all-stars and "contrarian" journalists Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi,
for a variety of reasons, extremists not only on the right but also on
the left embrace or parrot Kremlin talking points and narratives after
years of these effective influence operations, shaping debate from both
within the halls of government power and newsrooms, corrupting and
bending the debate to Russia's ends. [Russian disinformation
is]{.underline} thus [vastly amplified]{.underline} and passed on
further as misinformation by the duped and again as disinformation by
the corrupted so that public opinion, media, and even laws [and policies
become]{.underline} more **[anti-NATO]{.underline}**, more
**[anti-EU]{.underline}**, more **[anti-American]{.underline}**, more
**[pro-secession]{.underline}**, more **[pro-Russia]{.underline}**, more
**[pro-Putin]{.underline}** as a result. And [when the Kremlin's
candidates win, they]{.underline} and their allies may [spout Russian
disinformation]{.underline} to suit their ends, as former FBI
counterintelligence agent Asha Rangappa explains is the case with the
Trump Administration. [They]{.underline} can also can move to [obstruct
efforts to both investigate Russian infiltration and hold Russia
accountable for its cyberwarfare]{.underline}, with clear and
indisputable examples of late from the Trump Administration and Boris
Johnson's UK government as illustrated clearly in the Mueller report and
the aforementioned British parliamentary report, respectively. Even when
the Kremlin's chosen do not win, these Russian operations still manage
to weaken their victorious opponents and skew political atmosphere.

All [[this has been]{.underline}]{.mark} the case to varying degrees
from Washington to Rome, from London to Berlin, **[[weakening NATO and
its ability to collectively defend itself]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Over
time, the degree to which the pendulum has swung to more pro-Russian
positions and people has been nothing short of remarkable and very much
in part because of Russia's concerted cyberwarfare effort. And all this
further divides the Alliance and even member states' own societies
internally, which itself is also a major goal of Russia's.

[[Europe]{.mark} is currently [experiencing]{.mark} escalating
**[political and military tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are
rekindling fears of [war between Russia and NATO]{.underline}. Any such
conflict [would]{.underline} inherently [include a [risk of **nuclear
weapons** use]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Stimson Center, partnered with
Project High Hopes, is examining the results of such nuclear exchanges
and, more importantly, developing initiatives to avoid such
catastrophes.

Vladimir [Putin has]{.underline} revealed that he was
[prepared]{.underline} to use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine crisis and
would protect ethnic Russian populations through any means necessary.
[There are]{.underline} significant **[[ethnic Russian populations in
Estonia and Latvia]{.underline}]{.mark}** with a history of
disagreements and some conflict with the national governments. [Any
armed **[conflict between]{.mark} a [Russian secessionist
movement]{.mark} and a Baltic government** could provide Russia an
excuse for military intervention, which could easily **[devolve into a
war with NATO and]{.mark} a [risk]{.mark} of [nuclear
use]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Illustratively, one could [imagine]{.underline} a scenario we call
Escalation in Estonia, beginning with [the seizure by pro-Russian rebels
of local government buildings]{.underline}. Responding to an Estonian
request, **[[NATO mobi-lizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** against the rebels,
and Russian troops move across the border. [Desperate to end the
conflict]{.underline} before more NATO forces can arrive, in conformity
[with its [doctrine]{.mark} "**[escalate to deescalate]{.mark}**," the
Russians [launch]{.mark}]{.underline} two **[[nuclear-armed
missiles]{.underline}]{.mark}** on NATO forces. [NATO]{.underline}, in
turn, [responds with]{.underline} two **[nuclear bombs]{.underline}**
delivered by US B-2 bombers on Russian military headquarters within
Estonia. As a result, Tallinn is largely destroyed and nearly 100,000
civilians and military service men and women could be expected to die as
a result of the conflict and its aftermath.

[The prevalence and risk of cyberattacks continue to rise]{.underline}
in parallel with our increasing reliance on the Internet for systems of
economic production, supply and distribution chains, finance, power,
transportation, and other critical infrastructures. [Cyber warfare is
becoming the **next serious threat to national security**]{.underline} 1
that can impact not only life and property but also financial markets. 2
According to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS),
the total number of cyber-attacks against government agencies, defense
and high-tech companies, or economic crimes with losses of over one
million dollars rose from 21 in 2014 to 58 in 2017. 3 This CSIS list,
built on open-source data only, depicts a worrisome trend of rising
cyberattacks attributed to state-sponsored groups acting against the
political or economic interests of other states.

In testimony delivered to the US Armed Services Committee in January
2017, James Clapper, former US Director of National Intelligence, stated
that more than 30 nations were developing offensive cyberattack
capabilities as of late 2016. He further opined that "[the proliferation
of cyber capabilities coupled with new warfighting technologies will
increase the **incidence of standoff and remote
operations**]{.underline}, [especially in the **initial stages of
conflict."**]{.underline}4 As policymakers warn of the dangers of cyber
conflicts and exalt the virtues of cyber peace, most [states consider
cyberspace the fifth operational domain, with]{.underline} equal, or
perhaps **[greater future importance]{.underline}** [to the traditional
domains of land, sea, air, and space]{.underline}. State military and
intelligence agencies continue to conduct cyber espionage and covert
attacks on computer systems and networks in pursuit of strategic
political or military objectives, both before and during conflicts. Yet,
there is limited transparency on how states consider using their cyber
capabilities, as only a few countries have publicly announced their
cyber doctrines and underlying strategies. For example, McAfee, the
global computer security software company, estimated in 2007 that over
120 countries were working on cyber commands, 5 whereas Dévai listed 114
countries that, as of 2013, were developing civilian and military cyber
capabilities, policies, doctrines and organizations at varying levels of
maturity or focus. 6 Considering that many of the officially declared
'defensive' cyber capabilities could easily be deployed in offensive
cyber operations, as well as the fact that data assembled by cyber
experts is often based on publicly available information only, it is not
surprising that such estimations vary, and that the true state of cyber
warfare preparedness and capabilities worldwide is difficult to
ascertain. This [high degree of uncertainty, when coupled with the low
cost and easy acquisition of cyber weapons, ample and growing target
selection, and multiplicity of types of attacks that may go **unnoticed
for a long time**]{.underline}, [contributes to a prevailing state of
**cyber insecurity**]{.underline} in the international community. The
problem is further exacerbated by the fact that there is no commonly
accepted terminology of critical cyber terms (e.g., 'cyber' vs.
'information' security) among key cyber actors, which affects the
ability of most likely strategic adversaries to establish common ground
as a prerequisite for dialogue.

Cyber warfare is a broad term that refers to actions by nation-state
actors (or other international organizations with mala fide intentions)
to use hacking tools to achieve military objectives in another country.
[The tools for hacking are varied and can include malicious software,
denial-of-service attacks, social engineering, fake news, and malicious
insiders as well as tools for **camouflaging identify** of hackers or
misdirecting attribution]{.underline}. The objectives could be tactical
or strategic. The tactical objectives could be degrading the capability
of an adversary both in the battlefield or in weapons development (e.g.,
Stuxnet) or espionage to collect intelligence[. The strategic objectives
could be the use of soft power such as propaganda to influence public
opinion for regime change or **altering the political outcomes of the
election** or hard power by leaving dormant malicious software in
**critical infrastructure** to leverage during times of
conflict.]{.underline}

[The boundary between conventional and cyber war is
**blurring**]{.underline} as conventional defensive and offensive
capabilities increasingly use the Internet for command, control,
communications, and intelligence, making information and communication
infrastructures and networks both the targets and vehicles of military
attacks. At the same time, the Internet has become the communications
backbone required for the functioning of modern societies and economic
systems. Therefore, [the nature and means of the military defense of
these systems]{.underline} also hav[e to change and become more flexible
to adapt to these emerging threa]{.underline}ts. **[Above
all,]{.underline}** [the nascent cyber defense mechanism of any state
must be able to provide the national political leadership with answers
regarding a number of critical questions: What is the origin of a
cyberattack; where did it come from? Who is responsible? What is the
recommended course of action, or response?]{.underline}

Attribution

[Attribution of cyberattacks]{.underline} **[is very
important]{.underline}**, especially [to justify retaliatory actions
against the perpetrators and prevent **accidental
retaliation**]{.underline} against innocent targets. [The entire domain
of cyber norms and confidence-building measures is centered on
visibility]{.underline}, i.e., [being able to identify perpetrators of
attacks and being able to ascertain adversarial strength. In the absence
of such verification, the suspicion remains]{.underline}, and [nation
states assume the worst]{.underline} and prepare themselves by building
stronger and stronger arsenals to maintain strategic equilibrium.

Anonymity is often regarded as a key foundational principle of the
Internet, driven by the need to shield the identity of the user and
dissociate users' actions from their identity. 7 Such anonymity ensures
the ability to speak freely without fear of retribution, which can be
beneficial in political commentaries, debating contentious issues,
asking personal questions, researching competitors, and purchasing goods
or services without revealing personal choices. Privacy advocates have
gone to great lengths to protect the anonymity of users by providing
services, such as remailers and encryption, that further camouflage
users' identities and protect them from government surveillance.
However, while beneficial in some contexts and circumstances, such
anonymity also shields the perpetrators of crime and terrorism on the
Internet. 8 [The cloak of anonymity protects and enables perpetrators of
money laundering, extortion, espionage, and theft]{.underline}.
[Similarly, actors engaging in cyber warfare leverage anonymity on the
Internet to conduct surveillance, probes, and attacks without drawing
attention to their actions]{.underline}. There has to be a balance
between anonymity and security to ensure people's right to privacy and
security. 9

Forensics and Attribution

Despite the inherent anonymity of the Internet, users leave traces of
their activities along the way. These traces can provide valuable clues
that can reveal the identity of the attackers and their possible
motivations. The goal of digital forensics is to collect the traces,
connect the dots, and make inferences about the incident, including
identifying the perpetrators, determining the mechanism of operation,
and cataloging the information compromised or altered. The tools,
processes, and knowledge for digital forensics are freely available.
Still, the anonymity of the Internet makes such analysis difficult,
especially in the case of cyber warfare, where relevant information of
the attack is hidden behind country firewalls and protected by the
sponsors of the attack.

Digital forensics can strip away some of the Internet's anonymity and
narrow down the field of perpetrators by piecing these clues together
and creating a chain of evidence that can link the attacker to the
incident. 10 Such evidential chains may not constitute irrefutable
evidence in a court of law. Still, when combined with additional
information such as legal, political, intelligence, and policy
considerations, the resulting assessment could allow policymakers to
formulate a national response to cyberattacks. From a national security
perspective, as Healey argued, knowing "who to blame" can be more
important than "who did it?"11 A proper response to this question
provides national authorities with the ability to assess the situation
during an evolving conflict and weigh possible responses from a range of
economic, diplomatic, or other tools at their disposal. As a
multi-dimensional issue that draws on all sources of information
available, including technical forensics, human and signals
intelligence, historical precedents, and geopolitics, attribution of
attacks to a state actor in cyber warfare requires a genuinely national
effort and the development of corresponding technical and non-technical
capabilities. It is through these processes of data collection and
sharing, and analysis and cooperation conducted at national and
international levels, that digital forensics becomes instrumental in the
operationalization and practical evolution of a robust
confidence-building measure (CBM) regime.

The tools and techniques of cyberattacks are common to "cyber warfare,"
"cyber terrorism" and "cyber activism." Only by analyzing the actors,
modes of operation, and motivations behind attacks, and their intended
or manifested targets, can one differentiate between the three. In
contrast to conventional warfare, it is very difficult to distinguish
whether attacks on a website or the online theft of data are
attributable to individuals in another state who are motivated by
financial gain, political or religious ideology, or actions taken by
that state's intelligence agency or military (or their proxies). Since
states may launch cyberattacks via proxies in other states, attribution
difficulties are compounded, and present fundamental challenges during
both conflict and peace times, when international cooperation and treaty
compliance verification take hold.

Digital forensics involves gathering data logged in different devices,
including computers, routers, electronic industrial control systems, and
mobile devices, 12,13,14 putting it on the same timeline and making
inferences to determine the anatomy of the attack/intrusion. Several
pieces of relevant information can be used for tracing the activities of
a person or a device, including IP-addresses, domain names, and time
stamps. 15 These individual entries in different log files can be
time-correlated to create a chain of evidence and demonstrate activity
emanating from a specific source.

An equally important dimension of digital forensics is the detection of
intrusion and post-incident analysis, whereby investigators need to
understand how an attack was launched, what was stolen, damaged or
changed, and how to prevent the attack from occurring in the future. 16
This involves analyzing the internal logs of actors involved in the
cyberattack and piecing together evidence from multiple sources into a
single timeline of events. The evidence can be collected from hard
drives, RAM, USB drives, storage devices, and network appliances. The
fundamental problem with such analysis is the sheer volume of the data.
Also, to forensically examine data from the past, it needs to be stored.
Data storage limitations, especially network devices that generate
enormous amounts of data, also limit the possible time frame of
analysis. 17 Other useful forensic techniques include analysis of social
networks, as well as text analysis from social media to identify cyber
warfare activities, such as propaganda, terrorist recruitment, or
information exchange. Some of this analysis is done by hand, but a
majority of it is done using automated tools that can sift through large
volumes of text to flag relevant data for human analysts. Linguistic
tools used for text analysis have become much more sophisticated over
the last decade, from simple word counting to separating parts of speech
and gaining limited language understanding. These forensic tools can
help address the problems of attribution and provide means of dealing
with contentious issues related to attribution and deflection of
responsibility.

Forensics practices are well established and tools are available to
rapidly analyze data and draw inferences from it. The data for analyses
can be collected from devices and networks within organizations and
Internet Service Providers (ISPs). There are, however, fundamental
issues with forensic analyses and data collections that cross
international borders and reach outside of a nation-state's
jurisdictional control. First, much of the data is stored in routers and
devices that are with the ISPs, which are subject to local laws. The
data can be in multiple sources on the network and needs to be acquired
before analysis. If data is not collected shortly after the incident, it
can be overwritten. Consequently, administrative delays in coordination
across countries can undermine forensics efforts. Additionally, if a
state is complicit in the launch of an attack, the veracity of the data
itself can be in question. The data could have been doctored, tailored,
or completely faked. Second, getting physical access to the
perpetrator's computer requires a level of cooperation among countries
that may be possible in cases of crime, but strained or nonexistent
during cyber warfare. Third, all data can be spoofed, i.e., a fake
address of origin can be used in packets to conceal the real IP-address,
making the problem of identification even more difficult. Finally, the
use of anonymizing tools can camouflage the perpetrators further, making
attribution complicated.

All of these challenges make technical attribution for international
cyber incidents difficult, though not impossible. It is still possible
and has dramatically improved over the last few years through sustained
intelligence efforts. In addition to data collected directly from ISPs
and organizations, data can be collected through the use of honey pots
and prepositioned data taps across global networks. Intelligence
agencies are continuously monitoring the activities of known actors
(including nation states). They are building intelligence dossiers that
can be coupled with knowledge gained from digital forensics to make more
definitive attributions.

Knowledge of previous events, tools, and techniques of known actors can
be used to trace the origins of attacks. There is no automated analysis
process; rather, analysts painfully evaluate evidence and make
probabilistic judgments for assigning attribution. There are different
levels of attribution, with each level becoming more difficult to assign
attribution or point of origin (nation-state, hacker group), specific
device (computer used to launch an attack), and an individual
responsible for launching the attack. It is even harder to accurately
pinpoint the sponsor of an attack, in cases where the hacker/group is
working as a proxy.

Discussion

There are limits to what digital forensics can accomplish. These tools
will only work to the extent that there is a political will for
international cooperation in data sharing and analysis. Important first
steps would include the establishment of hotlines and the deployment at
strategic locations of standard data collection devices that could not
be tampered with. These could be foundational to support the forensic
analysis of cyberattacks and international determination of instances of
cyber warfare. An international body needs to be created and deployed in
a neutral country to monitor and evaluate cyber conflicts, with
observers present from warring nations. This body would be able to
quickly request data access from different sources; lengthy procedures
can delay and limit the collection of data, which can be ephemeral. This
body will also have the technical expertise to analyze large volumes of
data and determine attribution, as well as to confidentially handle
intelligence without having to reveal its sources.

Digital forensics practices were developed to effectively piece together
the evidence in criminal cases where: the data footprint is small; there
is physical access to devices; and the perpetrators involved are
relatively inexperienced with camouflaging techniques. This is very
rarely the scenario when attacks are perpetrated by well-trained
professional hackers. As a result, intelligence agencies have already
adapted and scaled forensics procedures for nation-state cyberattacks; a
lot of these practices are not yet in the public domain. We will need to
create standard forensics procedures (publicly available) for
investigating cross border attacks in which camouflaging techniques have
been deployed.

Additionally, digital forensics is constantly lagging behind the torrid
pace of technological evolution, both in types of applications and
devices, as well as in volumes of data. 18 In the coming years, digital
forensics will need to be able to contend with the extremely high
volumes of data, as well as the sophisticated camouflaging techniques
that are used in cyber warfare to become a credible factor in the
attribution of cyber warfare activities. To be able to stay on course,
we need to have an international forensics research institute for
researching and updating forensics practices as information
infrastructures evolve (e.g., connected vehicles, human-implantable
devices, self-driving cars). We also need to train experts in each
country on best practices (tools and techniques) in digital forensics so
that they can conduct their investigations.

We must realize that attribution may not always be perfect due to
purposeful misdirection or limitations of the analysis itself. This was
illustrated by the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment in November
2014. A hacker group calling itself the "Guardians of Peace" released
confidential Sony data onto the Internet, including personal employee
data, vast email and password files, internal documents and
communications, unreleased copies of motion pictures, and much more.
There are two conflicting theories of attribution: one suggests that the
North Korean government was behind the attack, given the similarity of
the malware used to that used in previous attacks by the North Koreans;
19 the other, based on linguistics analysis, suggests that Russians
conducted the attack. 20 There is no conclusive proof supporting either
theory, only circumstantial evidence based on the conventional triad of
means, motives, and opportunity. To address this, we must resort to a
probabilistic approach and define standards of attributions based on the
confidence levels of attribution and permissible retaliation to prevent
the disproportionate response from escalating into a kinetic conflict.

[The demilitarization of cyberspace or a moratorium on the development
of cyber weapons]{.underline} **[is no longer a
possibility]{.underline}**. However, [nation states **must come
together**]{.underline} [to]{.underline} find common ground in cyber
warfare starting with confidence-building measures, norms of behavior,
and the applicability of international laws to reduce [the possibility
of a major catastrophic incident]{.underline}. Formal **[information
sharing]{.underline}** (both at CERT and diplomatic levels) and
establishing hotlines [will help deescalate future cyber
incidents]{.underline}. There needs to be consensus building at the
United Nations and other established international bodies such as the
Office of Security and Cooperation (OSCE) to find ways of building
consensus among nation states on preventing cyber conflicts and building
confidence.

Conclusions

The Internet is a major economic and societal driver and instrument of
knowledge dissemination with huge economic, political, and national
security consequences. It is also a place for data theft, espionage,
fake news, political influence, and propaganda, as has been evidenced in
the Middle East, South Asia, and Europe. [Nation-state attacks are
constantly growing both in terms of frequency]{.underline} of attacks
and sophistication. Such attacks undermine its influence as societal
glue and diminish its influence on economic prosperity. There have been
efforts to stem the escalation of cyber warfare; however, it has been
very hard to build consensus among nation states on the mechanisms for
de-escalation of cyber warfare. Lack of transparency in cyber weapon
development and attribution of cyberattacks has been a critical barrier
to the acceptance of confidence building measures. Improvement in data
collection (intelligence) and forensic analytics capabilities has given
us a much better cyber incident attribution capability. By building
consensus among nation-states on protocols and procedures for
attribution and clarifying the applicability of international law, we
can start to build consensus on CBMs and norms and make the Internet
safer and enable it to thrive. The paper suggests several initiatives to
reduce the chances of cyber conflict as well as to prevent cyber
conflicts from escalating, such as defining clear processes for
attribution, creating neutral bodies for incident analysis, and limiting
the scope of retaliation based on the confidence in attribution.

[Although cooperation between international stakeholders is

I. [Improved information sharing is a way to help **drive situations
rightward**]{.underline} along the information strength (X) axis [in
ways that would]{.underline}, all other things being equal, [create a
**greater likelihood of agreement.**]{.underline} [This could mean doing
more to share with international partners intelligence reporting that
supports attribution analysis, either **passing it directly to
partners**]{.underline} with whom one has good cyber-intelligence
relationships (e.g., within the "Five Eyes" partnership) [or by
**downgrading information to be shared** with others]{.underline}.
Information sharing can also occur via public criminal
indictments---which must meet due process standards and ultimately
survive beyond a reasonable doubt proof standards for conviction if they
get to court---or perhaps in connection with the imposition of
sanctions.\[43\]

**[Whatever the means,]{.underline}** however, [building more effective
mechanisms for secure sharing of attribution-relevant information
would]{.underline} probably [have the effect of making attribution
agreement **more likely**]{.underline}. [It can also help **strengthen
interlocutors' perceptions of trust**]{.underline} in the sharer,
potentially [causing agreement-conducive movement]{.underline} along the
graphical Y-axis as well. (A country sharing more information with a
second-party partner that is more trusted by the third-party target of
diplomatic suasion than is the first country can also help spur movement
along both axes: it enables the recipient of this information to
leverage its own relationship of trust with the ultimate target.)
Augmented [information sharing can thus result in movement]{.underline}
within the cubic situational space along both the X and Y axes, as
depicted in Case I in Figure 13.

[To the degree that attribution]{.underline}-relevant [information can

about specific intrusions]{.underline}, however, [it might be possible
in the future to include not just information about specific TTPs
themselves but also an indication of which bad actor originated a given
technique and with whom that technique's use is most frequently
associated]{.underline}. To the degree that subsequent attribution
diplomacy relies upon analysis of cyber-attack techniques, [such a
public record of past associations between bad actors and specific TTPs
could help increase the credibility of subsequent attribution
assessments, strengthening diplomatic persuasiveness.\[45\]]{.underline}

principle indicates the necessity to maintain control over information
because its loss threatens the security despite saving its
confidentiality and integrity. The second principle is about the
originality of authorship of the information. And finally, utility means
that information is still usable after all other security precautions.

Definitions and Scope

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [**Official U.S. [government definitions]{.mark}** [of
**security cooperation** are **very broad**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
definition from [the D]{.underline}efense [S]{.underline}ecurity
[C]{.underline}ooperation [A]{.underline}gency [states that security
cooperation]{.underline}

> comprises all activities undertaken by the Department of Defense (DoD)
> to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United
> States to achieve strategic objectives. It [[includes **all DoD
> interactions** with foreign]{.mark} defense and [security
> establishments]{.mark}]{.underline}, including all DoD-administered
> Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense and security
> relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests, including all
> international armaments cooperation activities and SA activities;
> develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
> multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
> contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions **[clearly include]{.mark}** almost [**any
security-related activity** for **any purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
scope the focus of the study, [we reviewed official **[state
doc]{.mark}ument[s]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} strategies and [the
**lit**]{.mark}**erature** on security cooperation to [identify]{.mark}
11 **[types of activities:]{.mark}**]{.underline}

1\. **[[military aid]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which includes funding
through the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense
Articles program, and other grants and loans

2\. **[arms [sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** and transfers,4 such as U.S.
arms sales through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct
Commercial Sales (DCS) programs

3\. military capacity-building, such as U.S. activities under Section
1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and Sections and
2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the **[[train and
equip]{.underline}]{.mark}** authority)

4\. **[[education]{.mark} and training]{.underline}**, including
international military education and training (IMET), professional
military education (PME), and regional centers

5\. **[personnel [exchanges]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as U.S.
activities under the Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State
Partnership Program

6\. **[military [exercises]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both bilateral and
multilateral and those that involve foreign partners

7\. access-related agreements, such as status of forces agreements
(**[[SOFAs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and agreements related to base access
[and **[info]{.mark}rmation-[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}

8\. armament-related agreements, such as those for
**[[co-development]{.underline}]{.mark}** of systems and for research,
development, test, and evaluation activities

9\. **[[sustainment]{.underline}]{.mark}** of donor-nation equipment by
the donor, the partner, or third parties

10\. **[institutional [capacity--building]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
strengthen the partner institutions that support security services

11\. [**humanitarian assistance** and **disaster relief**]{.underline}
(HA/DR), which offers support for efforts to relieve suffering.

[These categories offered a consistent template for gathering
data]{.underline} across our various study components. A major challenge
was that reliable and consistent data on each of the 11 categories were
not available for all the competitors---not even for the United States.
Especially at the unclassified level, there is simply no comprehensive
roster of security cooperation activities by the United States, and
neither China nor Russia publishes inclusive data sets of its programs.
An additional challenge was that, in some cases, the different countries
define the categories somewhat differently, so we could not develop data
on entirely comparable sets of security cooperation activities.

technology and politics reporter., 1-4-2022
https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/5-things-to-watch-going-into-the-midterms/\]

Though 2022 has only just begun, the [midterm elections are already
looming over the political horizon]{.underline}. Democrats' loss in the
Virginia governor's race last year --- and their surprisingly narrow win
in the New Jersey governor's race --- both suggested that we could be
heading for a red wave in this year's midterm elections. And overall,
the political environment is looking favorable for Republicans. Based on
House retirements --- which can give us some clues about how the
congressional elections might unfold --- it also seems like Democrats
are more worried than Republicans. Those worries aren't unfounded,
either, since the president's party almost always struggles in midterm
elections, usually losing ground in the House and often in the Senate
too.

[But]{.underline} [[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} also a **[lot of
[factors that]{.mark} could [shake things up.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Over the past year, [Republican legislatures]{.underline} across the
country have [passed an unprecedented slew of [laws to restrict **voting
access**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including some states that]{.underline}
will be most [closely watched]{.underline} this November. [[Fears about
**inflation**]{.mark} are simmering]{.underline}, [but the **labor
market** is recovering]{.underline}, albeit unevenly. Meanwhile,
[**[COVID]{.mark}**-19 cases have surged to an all-time high, driven by
the omicron variant]{.underline}, even if so far deaths and
hospitalizations have not been as bad as last year. And finally, [state
lawmakers are]{.underline} in the process of **[[redrawing congressional
maps]{.underline}]{.mark}** [based on the results of the 2020 census,
setting the geographic boundaries that will [shape congressional
power]{.mark} for the next decade]{.underline} [([if]{.mark} the [courts
don't strike them down)]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[[It's impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of course**[, [to
predict]{.mark} how all of these four moving pieces]{.underline}** ---
voting restrictions, the economy, the pandemic and redistricting ---
**[will affect each other]{.underline}**. But we do have a sense of the
role they could play individually. So here's an overview of what we know
about what each of these indicators could mean for the midterms, and
what kinds of surprises could be in store this year.

A wave of [[voting restrictions]{.underline}]{.mark} could affect
turnout in swing states

Under the fraudulent pretense that widespread voter fraud cost former
President Donald Trump the 2020 presidential election, at least 22
states have passed 53 or more new voting restrictions. And since the
federal government has not yet passed federal voting rights legislation,
these statewide bills could have an impact on turnout and voter
enthusiasm heading into the midterms.

The number of voting restrictions that were enacted in 2021 is
astonishing. In fact, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, the
total number of restrictions passed in 2021 shatters the previous
record-high, which was 2011, when 14 states enacted 19 bills by October
of that year. And a lot of the bills passed this cycle have curtailed
the expansion of absentee voting from the pandemic, but bills requiring
proof of identity to vote and preventing the implementation of automatic
voter registration were prioritized too.

The short- and long-term [[effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of these newest
statewide laws [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} still a bit of **[[an open
question]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [we've never seen such aggressive and
widespread GOP-led efforts to pass new voter restrictions, but also
there's conflicting research on the effects of proposals like
these]{.underline}. On the one hand, some studies show that some
policies, like voter ID laws, which have long been anathema to Democrats
and voting rights advocates, don't necessarily decrease voter
participation, even among people of color. And although a number of
Republican-led states targeted absentee voting after it helped clinch
Biden's 2020 victory, a recent study found that states that implemented
absentee voting in 2020 didn't see a huge increase in turnout when
compared with states that did not implement it. So it's not a foregone
conclusion that states like Georgia, which has received national
attention for pushing stringent and anti-democratic voter laws, will
actually see lower turnout --- at least probably not as a result of the
restrictions. In fact, other reporting has found that,
counterintuitively, some restrictions can backfire and instead boost
turnout because voters might be more energized to cast a ballot.

That said[, the totality of the laws that have been passed this cycle
makes it **hard to predict their effects** this]{.underline}
[November]{.underline}. And the fact remains that [some of the most
restrictive measures on the books are in swing states, which could
affect the midterm result, in addition to disenfranchising voters
there]{.underline}. There's also, of course, the possibility that the
newest state laws will make administering elections more open to
partisan interference, since [[many]{.mark} of the bills]{.underline}
proposed by Republican legislatures reassigned election administration
to highly partisan legislatures --- which could [[allow]{.mark} elected
[lawmakers to **overturn the**]{.mark} **will** of the [voters and
determine]{.mark} their own preferred [winners]{.mark} of
elections.]{.underline}

Economic worries could play a role --- but they might be trumped by
partisanship

Inflation is accelerating at the fastest pace in decades, and although
the economy is bouncing back in other ways, most Americans feel
pessimistic about the country's economic challenges. That could be a
worrying sign for Democrats' electoral chances in the midterms this
year. Often, the economy is seen as a critical electoral indicator,
particularly regarding presidential elections.

But the upcoming election cycle could be different. That's in part
because there's evidence that the economy just doesn't matter as much in
midterm elections. More broadly, views of the state of the economy are
also increasingly partisan --- which means that Republican and
Democrats' views of the economy may be more influenced by politics than
by how the economy is actually doing.

This is not to say that the economy can't influence politicians'
electoral fates. In fact, political science research has found that
voters do reward presidential candidates when the economy is good, and
punish them when it's bad. It's the overall trajectory of the economy
that's most important here, too, according to Christopher Wlezien, a
professor of government at the University of Texas-Austin. "You might
have a low unemployment rate and a low inflation rate, but if the
economy's not growing, that's not really a 'good' economy," he said.

But researchers have consistently found that the economy isn't as
important of a factor in midterm elections. That's not because the
economy is only important every four years --- it's just that other
factors, like the generic ballot (a measure of which party people would
back for Congress), are better predictors of which way the midterms will
go.

Partisanship, too, can have a dampening effect. Polling consistently
shows that Americans' feelings about the health of the economy shift
dramatically depending on whether a Republican or Democrat is president.

That detachment from the actual health of the economy could be
particularly pronounced in this year's midterms because the pandemic has
the economy in such an intense state of flux. On the one hand, Democrats
can point to economic improvement since Biden took over last January ---
the unemployment rate is falling and wages are rising. But there are
worrying signs as well. There are the surging inflation numbers, for
instance, and metrics like the unemployment rate are relative. In the
November 2021 jobs report, the unemployment rate was 4.2 percent ---
much better than April 2020, when it was a horrifying 14.7 percent, but
still quite not back to its pre-pandemic levels.

This leaves plenty of room for Americans' political identities to
influence how they see the economy. Those assessments will still be
based on voters' everyday economic realities --- whether they think the
rent and the price of milk are rising, whether they've lost or gotten a
job, whether their neighbors seem to be struggling or prospering. But
their preexisting views about the parties will likely do a lot to shape
how they view the economy.

Voters' fears about COVID-19 could haunt politicians

As we approach the two-year anniversary of the start of the COVID-19
pandemic in the U.S., there is still much uncertainty about what the
future holds. While vaccination rates continue to slowly climb, the
highly transmissible omicron variant and the need for all Americans to
receive booster shots highlight just how unpredictable this pandemic
remains. Despite concerns around omicron, many Americans are unwilling
to give up the small freedoms they've gradually clawed back, and even
with the new variant, inflation now beats out COVID-19 as the top
concern in polls. This may be what it looks like for COVID-19 to start
to become a fact of life, rather than a temporary disaster. But whether
the pandemic is top of mind for voters this November or not, it will
inarguably play a role in the midterms --- both politically and
practically.

Let's start with the practical ramifications. The 2020 election landed
during an early wave of the pandemic, and most states made a number of
special concessions to the way voters cast their ballots to make things
safer and encourage physical distancing. But while these measures were
enacted temporarily in some states, they've now become permanent in
others. Nevada and Vermont switched to universal mail voting during the
pandemic, for instance, and both have now made the change permanent,
while many other states have now made no-excuse absentee voting (meaning
voters don't need a specific reason to vote by mail) the law of the
land.

Even some states that have recently enacted voter restriction laws kept
a few pandemic-time voting expansions. For example, despite taking steps
to make it harder to vote, Georgia also required a minimum number of
drop boxes per county (prior to the pandemic, drop boxes weren't
required at all). It seems that once voters tried out new, more
convenient ways of voting, many didn't want to go back to the old way of
doing things.

But beyond changes to how we vote, the long tail of the pandemic will
also likely play a role in for whom we vote --- or that's what many
politicians are banking on, at least. On the Democrats' side, there's an
effort to celebrate the party's successes in responding to the pandemic,
such as the relief package passed in March 2021, while also criticizing
the response from Republicans. For example, during the California recall
election last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom touted his pandemic response and
later claimed his win demonstrated that voters appreciated a strong
response to COVID-19. (How much of a role COVID-19 played in Newsom's
victory, however, is up for debate.) But Americans' approval of the
Biden administration's response to the pandemic has precipitously
dropped since early July 2021, around the time delta became the
country's dominant strain.

Earlier in the pandemic, approval of Biden's COVID-19 response was much
higher --- higher even than his overall approval rating. Now, though,
one of his few strong suits with the public has diminished, giving
Republicans fresh ammunition. Republicans have leaned into calling out
Democratic responses to the pandemic, like vaccine and mask mandates, as
violations of freedom, although some Republicans have encouraged voters
to get vaccinated (which hasn't proven to be a particularly effective
message with their voters). They've also begun firing up their base over
the economic woes that have rippled out of the pandemic, such as labor
shortages and supply chain delays.

There's also a good chance that other issues will eclipse the pandemic.
Along with the economy taking up more mental space lately, Americans'
concerns around the pandemic tend to ebb and flow with case numbers, as
a series of pre-omicron polls from Fox News show. When asked in early
August (as the late-summer surge was starting to grow), 69 percent of
registered voters said they were very or extremely concerned about the
pandemic. That number then grew to 74 percent in mid-September, as that
wave was cresting, but when asked again in mid-October (with that wave
on the retreat), it shrank back to 67 percent.

As vaccinations increase and more workers begin to trickle back into the
office, it's possible that the pandemic winds up playing a smaller role
in the midterms than it has so far. In fact, even in November 2020, as
cases swelled to record levels, COVID-19 didn't play as big of a role in
the election as many expected. By this November, it could be an even
more minor player in our electoral circus.

Republicans stand to benefit from redistricting, but the overall impact
might be small

We're roughly at the halfway point in redistricting, as 32 states with
279 congressional districts have finished redistricting following the
delayed release of the 2020 census last year.1 And while many states
still have to draw their lines, we already have a decent idea of what
the overall contours of the congressional map will be.

But given the amount of control Republicans have over the redistricting
process --- the GOP will draw more than twice as many districts as
Democrats this cycle --- it's a little surprising that neither party
looks set to make major gains in the House due solely to redistricting.
We just haven't seen a dramatic shift favoring one party in the states
that have finished drawing their lines. Compared with the old national
map, the number of Democratic-leaning seats (defined as seats having a
partisan lean of at least 5 percentage points more Democratic than the
country as a whole) has increased from the old map, while the number of
Republican-leaning seats (R+5 or redder) hasn't really changed.2

One thing we can point to, though, is that the number of highly
competitive seats --- those between D+5 and R+5 --- is down. And that's
in large part because Republicans have so far been particularly
successful in making competitive seats they control much safer for their
party in 2022. The number of competitive Republican-leaning seats has
shrunk from maps drawn the 2010 census, while the number of safe
Republican seats has increased markedly. We can see this trend clearly
in states where the GOP controlled redistricting, as previously
competitive seats like Indiana's 5th Congressional District or Texas's
24th District have become far redder.

For Democrats' part, they have also tried to create more
Democratic-leaning seats in states where they controlled redistricting.
So far, they haven't increased the number of safe Democratic districts,
but they have increased the number of competitive Democratic-leaning
seats. This reflects their strategy to trade away some dark-blue seats
in states like Illinois and Nevada to improve their party's position in
nearby districts that were more competitive on the pre-2022 maps.

The reduction in baseline competitive turf is an important feature of
this redistricting cycle; it means that the two parties will be able to
more easily lock in control over more seats and to narrow the
already-thin campaign battlefield. Most congressional districts are
currently quite safe for one party or the other, and that's not likely
to change. It's true that 18 states haven't yet finished drawing their
lines, but we don't expect one party to substantially benefit from these
new maps. Yes, Republican mapmakers in Florida may draw lines that add a
seat or two to their column, but Democrats in New York could produce a
map that gives them a chance of flipping a handful of GOP-held seats.

And beyond those two states, about one-third of the remaining seats left
to be drawn are not under one party's control, usually because the state
has divided government --- as is the case in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,
for instance. A map in one state might end up benefiting one party more
than the current lines, but this collection of maps could very well work
out to be a wash in the end.

Still, there are wild cards to keep in mind, such as lawsuits that could
overturn potential gerrymanders. Yet while Republicans have wider
control of redistricting than Democrats, and while they have done quite
a bit to shore up their incumbents, The Cook Political Report estimates
that the GOP might gain only two to three seats from the redistricting
process --- a seat swing that is unlikely to decide the House's fate on
its own, considering the president's party has, on average, lost 26
House seats in midterms since World War II.

[What about an **[October surprise]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

We've walked you through a host of factors that could influence the 2022
midterms, but [sometimes [a **surprising** **last-minute event** shakes
up the race]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A hallmark example]{.underline} of
this is the 2016 presidential election, when FBI Director James
[Comey]{.underline} sent a [letter]{.underline} to Congress days before
the election announcing that the FBI had reopened its investigation into
the private email server Hillary Clinton had used as secretary of state.
The news dominated headlines, and her lead in the national polls fell
nearly 3 points over the next week, with her going on to narrowly lose
to Donald Trump.

Now, there aren't many moments that count as "October surprises" ---
most day-to-day news events and candidate gaffes during a campaign don't
matter very much. But as the 2016 example shows, [[they
can't]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely [[be ruled out]{.mark} as a factor
that could affect voter attitudes, especially if a fair number of voters
haven't made up their minds.]{.underline}

#### Elections disad is a [lie]{.underline} -- plan's irrelevant

**[Bacon 10-7]{.underline}** \[Perry Bacon Jr. is a Washington Post
columnist 10-7-2021
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/10/07/perry-bacon-america-election-obsession/\]

Every day is not Election Day. Most days are not Election Day. [[Most of
what happens]{.mark} in the years between elections [won't
affect]{.mark} what happens on [Election]{.mark} Day. [Yet]{.mark} the
United States' political [culture]{.mark} has become]{.underline}
**[singularly [obsessed]{.mark} with elections]{.underline}**, directing
us away from important debates about issues and [turning every question
into an analysis of Wisconsin swing voters.]{.underline}

Of course elections matter, because they decide who gets to set policy.
And with the Republican Party becoming more authoritarian by the day,
state and federal elections matter especially now. If the GOP wins
enough state legislative, gubernatorial and congressional races over the
next few years, it may well use gerrymandering, voting-law changes and
other moves to create entrenched one-party rule.

And perhaps because of the radicalism on the right, I am seeing a rise
in political discussions framed around elections, from not only
politicians and activists but ordinary citizens, particularly Democrats.
Read political reporting, scroll Twitter or watch cable news, and you'll
notice that [much discourse]{.underline} ostensibly about, say, the
infrastructure bill, Afghanistan or President Biden [is really focused
on one all-consuming question:]{.underline} "[[How will this]{.mark}
[affect]{.mark} what swing [voters]{.mark} in Wisconsin --- or
Pennsylvania, or Arizona --- do in 2022 and 2024?"]{.underline}

Given the high stakes, the obsession is understandable. Nonetheless,
it's a bad development. Why?

First, some ideas deserve a hearing, even if they are unpopular. The
civil rights movement of the 1960s could not have survived a daily
analysis of how it affected the Democrats' standing in swing states ---
the March on Washington was unpopular when it happened, as was the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. at times. Today, it makes sense that the
Republican policymakers keep pushing abortion limits --- they believe
that is the moral position and are willing to absorb some electoral heat
for it. (And it might not be that much heat.)

On the Democratic side, defending the rights of immigrants and Black
people may never be particularly popular, and I am not arguing that
Biden should completely ignore electoral consequences and propose a
major reparations program next week. But Biden generally should not act
in morally dubious ways on racial issues simply to woo conservative
White voters, not only because such actions would be wrong but also
because there is limited evidence this would actually win him many White
swing voters.

Second, debating on electoral terms can prevent important discussions
about the substance of politics. "What should be in the reconciliation
bill?" would be a more useful question to explore with the public and
Democratic officials than "What are the electoral effects of passing or
not passing the reconciliation bill?"

Third, [[if we knew the]{.mark} precise [electoral effects]{.mark} of
passing]{.underline} those [bills]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} [most
other things that happen in politics]{.underline}), those [[effects
would be]{.mark} [important]{.mark} to talk about.
[But]{.mark}]{.underline} the truth is **[[we
don't]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Here's what we really know: [[Most]{.mark} Americans will [vote for
the]{.mark} [party they normally do]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[[Voters don't know much]{.mark} about policy details but]{.underline}
have some generic [predispositions]{.underline} that are [heavily shaped
by]{.underline} their **[ideology]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[media coverage]{.underline}**. [[There is a **small
group**]{.underline}]{.mark} of voters [who don't pay]{.underline} that
much [attention]{.underline} to politics [[who swing]{.mark}
[between]{.mark} the [parties]{.mark} [and]{.mark}/or [vote in
some]{.mark} [elections]{.mark} but not others]{.underline}. The
president's party generally does worse in midterm elections and when he
has a low approval rating.

That isn't much to work with. [Nonetheless]{.underline}, [[a whole class
of]{.mark} elected officials, strategists, [pundits]{.mark} and others
constantly make confident [claims]{.mark}.]{.underline} More
conservative Democrats are arguing that the party will suffer
electorally if it doesn't pass an infrastructure bill as soon as
possible, while more progressive Democrats argue that it will suffer if
it doesn't pass the reconciliation bill they favor. Democrats on neither
side of this ideological divide argue that the party must pass something
or voters will punish them next year. And Republicans confidently say
that the Democrats will lose in 2022 if they push through the bills.

[All of these arguments [are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[at best
overconfident]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [might
be]{.underline} **[[more accurately]{.mark} described as
[nonsense]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[There is little evidence]{.mark}
that most [voters]{.mark} carefully [track]{.mark} the [legislative
success]{.mark} of a political party and vote accordingly]{.underline}
--- [[and]{.mark} [undecided]{.mark} [and intermittent voters]{.mark}
**[know even less]{.mark}** about what's happening in
Washington.]{.underline}

Similarly, [[it's unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark} that the Democrats
making [[slight moves]{.underline}]{.mark} to the right on racial issues
will [[affect]{.mark} [voters' **broader perceptions**]{.mark} of the
GOP]{.underline} [as the party that is conservative]{.underline} on race
[and of the Democrats as liberal]{.underline} on those issues. I would
bet that Republicans win the major statewide races in Texas next year
despite the unpopularity of its recent abortion law --- and my guess is
most of the Democrats crowing about how that law will boost them
electorally would bet on the Republicans, too.

I know that politicians have long used polling to inform their
decisions. I know that the complaint that American politics is now a
"permanent campaign" is not new. And I actually think it's useful to
know where the public stands on issues, because the government generally
shouldn't take actions that only a small minority of the public
supports.

But the problem isn't really polling. Rather, it's the use of polls to
center everything that happens in politics around those November 2022
swing voters in Wisconsin. We can have election month, maybe even
election season, but when every day is Election Day, [we are robbing our
politics of real]{.underline}, substantive [debates]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} instead [concentrate on]{.underline} [possible
[electoral outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline} **[that [we can't predict or
control]{.mark} anyway.]{.underline}**

#### [COVID]{.underline}, [inflation]{.underline}, and [SCOTUS]{.underline} thump\-\--no one [runs on]{.underline} or [votes for]{.underline} the plan.

[Every election has a story.]{.underline}

In 2010, the story was an angry tea party movement and a rebellion
against President Barack Obama's newly enacted Affordable Care Act. In
2018, it was a backlash, fueled by the energy and fury of suburban
women, against the chaotic governing style and misogynistic belligerence
of President Donald Trump.

[The stories]{.underline} of some elections are often clearer in
retrospect than they are in the moment, but there [were blinking lights
throughout 2010 and 2018 that the party in control of the White House
was heading for trouble. **The same can be said for 2022**]{.underline}.
President [**Biden's approval ratings are in the danger zone**,
putting]{.underline} the [Democrats']{.underline} slender majorities
[in]{.underline} the House and Senate in **[jeopardy]{.underline}**.
Many [Democratic leaders are already braced]{.underline}, at a minimum,
[to lose control of the House.]{.underline}

Political volatility has become commonplace in a nation as deeply and
closely divided as America today. [Seven of the last eight elections
qualify as change elections]{.underline} --- a shift in the balance in
some important way. And, if Republicans were to capture the House and
Senate in November, Biden would become the fifth consecutive president
to see his party lose both chambers of Congress on his watch.

But other than Democratic nervousness, **[what is the story of this
year? What is motivating voters?]{.underline}** What forces are steering
the election, other than the tides of history?

[Analysts point to a nation weary]{.underline} at a time in which there
seems no escape from disorder, [whether it be]{.underline} the long bout
with the **[coronavirus]{.underline}** or **[soaring prices or rising
crime rates]{.underline}** in cities **[or]{.underline}** surging
crossings of undocumented **[immigrants]{.underline}** at the southern
border. Added to all of that is the brutal war of aggression in Ukraine
launched without provocation by Russian President Vladimir Putin, a
conflict that is redrawing the international order.

"[This is a country that is **exhausted from politics**]{.underline},"
said Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik, who served in the Clinton
administration. "**[It's exhausted from covid]{.underline}**. [It's
exhausted from uncertainty]{.underline}. [It's **exhausted from
inflation**]{.underline}. It's exhausted from the world unraveling.
[That's not great when you're in charge]{.underline}. But the second
factor is disappointment. There was a notion that with Biden taking
office we were going to come back to a sense of normalcy in the world."

"[Independent voters decide elections]{.underline},\" said Richard
Czuba, a Michigan-based analyst. \"Right now \[[in
Michigan]{.underline}\] [they are really worried about
**inflation**]{.underline} --- and it's [not just gas
prices]{.underline}. You talk to people in focus groups and
[they]{.underline} will [talk about milk and bread and
cereal]{.underline}. They understand that gas prices have soared because
of the war in Ukraine, but that's not the case for food."

[There is another element]{.underline} that now threatens to affect the
direction of these elections: **[the prospect that the Supreme Court
will overturn Roe v. Wade]{.underline}**, a monumental action that would
elevate a battle over the future of abortion rights into the campaign
debates. Such a decision in the case involving Mississippi's restrictive
abortion law could cut into what is now a Republican advantage in
enthusiasm to vote in November.

[Biden]{.underline} administration officials [and Democratic candidates
will offer]{.underline} their own story as a counter to the prevailing
gloomy predictions. Their [narrative]{.underline} will highlight passage
[of]{.underline} a major **[economic stimulus package and a bipartisan
infrastructure bill]{.underline}**, the creation of roughly 8 million
jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in a half-century. [Their
story]{.underline} now also [includes confirmation of the first Black
woman to the Supreme Court]{.underline} --- a promise kept by the
president to one of his party's most loyal constituencies. Democrats
also will seek to offset their disadvantages by mobilizing voters around
abortion and other cultural issues.

### A2: Deterrence/Disclosure DA

#### Turn \-\-- hoarding vulnerabilities DECREASES cybersecurity \-\-- makes our own systems more exploitable 

**[Jardine 20]{.underline}** \-\-- Eric Jardine Assistant Professor,
Political Science, Virginia Tech, "Optimizing Cyber Deterrence", In The
Cyber Deterrence Problem, Aaron F. Brantly, ed. (New York: Rowman and
Littlefield), page 87-104, 2020, https://osf.io/ns7b3

Deterrence is not straightforward in cyberspace. [[Maximizing deterrence
by trying to maximize]{.mark} the [retaliatory
potential]{.mark}]{.underline} of the NSA [**[will fail]{.underline}**.
[Upwards of 20 percent of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [weapons
that]{.mark} the [NSA attempts to hoard]{.mark} for a rainy day [are
**likely to be found by adversaries**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[and could
then be used to target American systems]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [By
[keeping]{.mark} this 20 percent of [zero-days under wraps]{.mark}, the
NSA [**weakens the US deterrent** by **diminishing the costs that an
adversary would need to undertake**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in order to
successfully target]{.mark} US [networks]{.mark} and devices. Punishment
and denial are interconnected. Simple [maximization of deterrent]{.mark}
outcomes [by maximizing the inputs to deterrence **does not
work.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Turn \-\-- Nondisclosure of vulnerabilities causes more risk

**[Comninos and Seneque 14]{.underline}** \-\-- Alex, Justus-Liebig
University Giessen, and Gareth, Geist Consulting, "Cyber security, civil
society and vulnerability in an age of communications surveillance," GIS
Watch, 2014,
<http://giswatch.org/en/communications-surveillance/cyber-security-civil-society-and-vulnerability-age-communications-sur>

Cyber security and vulnerability [[Cyber security]{.mark} discourse
[should focus]{.mark} more [on information security vulnerabilities,
rather than on threats]{.mark} and responses]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} focus [would help to delineate what constitutes a
cyber security issue, avoid cyber]{.underline} [security escalating to a
counter-productive national security issue]{.underline}, and place a
practical focus on the protection of all internet users.

[A security vulnerability]{.underline}, also called a "bug", [is a piece
of software code that contains an error or weakness]{.underline} [that
could allow a hacker to compromise the integrity, availability or
confidentiality of]{.underline} information contained, managed or
accessed by [that software]{.underline}.17When a vulnerability is
discovered, [a malicious hacker may make an "exploit"]{.underline}18 [in
order to compromise data or access to a computer. Malware]{.underline}
-- viruses and Trojan horses -- [require exploits]{.underline} (or
collections of exploits) [that take advantage of vulnerabilities.
Expertise in fixing]{.underline} [vulnerabilities is improving but not
keeping up with the pace of the growth]{.underline}. Compared to 15
years ago, all popular and contemporary desktop operating systems
(Windows, Linux and Mac) offer regular automated security updates which
fix or "patch" known vulnerabilities. While we are finding more
vulnerabilities in code and viruses than ever before, we are also
getting better at finding them. At the same time we keep producing more
software code, meaning that [[the net number of vulnerabilities is
increasing]{.mark}.]{.underline}19

[[Viruses and botnets]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Stuxnet and other
state-sponsored malware, [**[require vulnerabilities to
work]{.underline}**. [Finding and fixing vulnerabilities contributes to
a safer]{.underline}]{.mark} [and secure [internet]{.mark}]{.underline},
counters surveillance and can even save lives. For example, a
vulnerability in Adobe's Flash software was recently used against
dissidents in Syria.20

There are two categories of vulnerabilities, each requiring different
user and policy responses: zero-days and forever-days. [[Zero-days are
vulnerabilities for which there is no available fix yet]{.mark}, and may
be unknown to developers]{.underline}. Forever-days are vulnerabilities
which are known of, and either do not have a fix, or do have a fix in
the form of a patch or an update, but they are for the most part not
applied by users.

Zero-day vulnerabilities

[When a [zero-day]{.mark} is found, the original software developer
should be notified so that they may find a fix for the vulnerability and
package it as a patch or update sent out to users]{.underline}.
Furthermore, at some stage, users of the affected software that are
rendered vulnerable should also be informed, so they can understand if
they are or have been vulnerable and take measures to recover and
mitigate for the vulnerability.

Throughout the history of computers, "[hackers]{.underline}"21 [have
sought to use technology in ways that it was not originally
intended.]{.underline} This has been a large source of technological
innovation. Hackers have applied this logic to computer systems and have
bypassed security and found vulnerabilities for fun, fame, money, or in
the interests of a more secure internet. It is because of people that
break security by finding vulnerabilities that we can become more
secure. A problem for cyber security is that "[good]{.underline}" (or
"white hat") [hackers or "security researchers" may not be incentivised
to find zero-days and use this knowledge for good.]{.underline} Rather
than inform the software vendor, the project involved, or the general
public of a vulnerability, [hackers may decide not to disclose it and
instead to sell information about a vulnerability, or package it as an
exploit and sell it.]{.underline}

These exploits have a dual use: "They can be used as part of research
efforts to help strengthen computers against intrusion. But they
[[can]{.mark} also [be **weaponised** and **deployed aggressively** for
everything from government spying and **corporate espionage**]{.mark} to
flat-out fraud]{.underline}."22 [There is a growing market for zero-days
that operates in a grey and unregulated manner. [Companies sell exploits
to governments]{.mark} and law enforcement agencies [around the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}; however, there are concerns that these
companies are also supplying the same software to repressive regimes and
to intelligence agencies. [[There is]{.mark} also a [growing **black
market** where these exploits are sold for criminal
purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}[.23]{.mark}

#### Turn \-\-- Cyberdefense outweighs any offensive capabilities \-\-- deliberately weakening the internet guarantees successful attacks 

**[Masnick 13]{.underline}** \-\-- Mike, founder and CEO of Floor64 and
editor of the Techdirt blog, Oct 7th 2013, "National Insecurity: How The
NSA Has Put The Internet And Our Security At Risk," Techdirt,
<https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20131005/02231624762/national-insecurity-how-nsa-has-put-internet-our-security-risk.shtml>

But, really, the issue is that [[the]{.mark} NSA\'s [actions
aren\'t]{.mark} actually [helping national security]{.mark}, but
[they\'re doing the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[exact
opposite]{.underline}.]{.mark} [They\'re [making us]{.mark}
significantly **[less safe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Bruce Schneier made
this point succinctly in a recent interview: The NSA's actions are
making us all less safe. They're not just spying on the bad guys,
[they're **deliberately weakening Internet security** for
everyone]{.underline}---including the good guys. [[It's sheer folly to
believe that only]{.underline} [the NSA can exploit the
vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} [they create]{.underline}.
Additionally, by eavesdropping on all Americans, they're building the
technical infrastructure for a police state. The folks over at EFF have
dug into this point in much greater detail as well. [[Undermining
internet security **is a really bad idea**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
While it may make it slightly easier for the NSA to spy on people \--
[[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[makes it **much easier for others to
attack us**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For all this talk of national
security, **[it\'s making us a lot less secure.]{.underline}** In trying
to defend this situation, former NSA boss Michael Hayden recently argued
that [the NSA]{.underline}, when it comes across security
vulnerabilities, [makes a judgment call on whether or not it\'s worth
fixing or exploiting]{.underline} itself. He discussed how [[the NSA
thinks]{.mark} about whether or not [it\'s a
**\"NOBUS**]{.mark}\"]{.underline} (nobody but us)
[[situation]{.underline}, [where only the US could exploit the
hole]{.underline}:]{.mark} [You look at a vulnerability through a
different lens if even with the vulnerability it requires
substantial]{.underline} [computational power or substantial other
attributes and you have to make the judgment who else can do
this]{.underline}? If there\'s a vulnerability here that weakens
encryption but you still need four acres of Cray computers in the
basement in order to work it you kind of think \"NOBUS\" and that\'s a
vulnerability we are not ethically or legally compelled to try to patch
\-- it\'s one that ethically and legally we could try to exploit in
order to keep Americans safe from others. Of course, that ignores just
how sophisticated and powerful certain other groups and governments are
these days. As that article notes, [the NSA is]{.underline} known as [a
**major buyer** of [exploits sold on the market]{.mark}]{.underline} \--
but [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[means]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[every]{.mark} single [one of those exploits is known by non-NSA
employees]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and [the idea that
only]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the NSA is exploiting those is
laughable]{.underline}. [If t]{.underline}]{.mark}[he NSA [were truly
interested in \"national security\" it would be]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[helping]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to **close those
vulnerabilities**,]{.mark} not using them to their own
advantage]{.underline}. This leads to two more troubling issues \-- the
fact that the \"US Cyber Command\" is under the control of the NSA is
inherently problematic. Basically, the NSA has too much overlap between
its offensive and defensive mandates in terms of computer security.
Given what we\'ve seen now, it\'s pretty damn clear that [the NSA
**highly prioritizes offensive efforts** to break into computers, rather
than defensive efforts to protect Americans\' computers.]{.underline}
The second issue is CISPA. [The NSA and its defenders pushed CISPA
heavily, claiming that it was necessary for \"national security\" in
protecting against attacks.]{.underline} But a key part of [CISPA
was]{.underline} that it was [designed to grant]{.underline} [immunity
to tech companies from sharing information with\... the
NSA]{.underline}, which was effectively put in control over
\"cybersecurity\" under CISPA. [It seems clear]{.underline}, at this
point, [that]{.underline} the worst fears about [CISPA]{.underline} are
almost certainly true. It [was never about improving defensive
cybersecurity, but a cover story to enable **greater offensive efforts**
by the NSA which, in turn, makes us all a **lot less
secure**]{.underline}

#### Turn \-\-- hoarding vulnerabilities makes aggressive cyber attacks MORE likely

**[McGraw 13]{.underline}** \-\-- Gary McGraw, PhD, Chief Technology
Ofﬁcer of Cigital, and author of Software Security (AWL 2006) along with
ten other software security books. He also produces the monthly Silver
Bullet Security Podcast forIEEE Security & Privacy Magazine (syndicated
by SearchSecurity), Cyber War is Inevitable (Unless We Build Security
In), Journal of Strategic Studies - Volume 36, Issue 1, 2013, pages
109-119

[Also of note is the balancing effect that extreme cyber vulnerability
has on power when it comes to cyber war.]{.underline} In the case of the
Stuxnet attack, the balance of power was clearly stacked high against
Iran. Subsequently, however, Iran responded with the (alleged) hijacking
of a US drone being used for surveillance in Iranian airspace.10
[Ironically, it may be that the most highly developed countries are more
vulnerable to cyber warfare because they are more dependent on modern
high-tech systems.]{.underline} [In any case, [failure to build security
into the]{.mark} modern [systems we depend on can **backlash**]{.mark},
[lowering the already low barrier to entry for geopolitically motivated
cyber conﬂict]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**[Defending]{.mark}** against
cyberattack (by building security in) [is just as important as]{.mark}
developing [offensive measures]{.mark}. Indeed **[it is more
so]{.mark}**.]{.underline} War has both defensive and offensive aspects,
and understanding this is central to understanding cyber war.
**[[Over-concentrating on offense can be very dangerous]{.mark} [and
destabilizing because it encourages actors to attack ﬁrst and
ferociously]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [before an adversary
can.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Conversely, [when defenses are equal]{.mark}
or even superior to offensive forces, [actors have **less incentive to
strike ﬁrst**]{.mark} because the expected advantages of doing so are
far lower.]{.underline} [[The United States is supposedly very good at
cyber offense]{.mark} today, [but from a cyberdefense
perspective]{.mark} **[it lives in the same glasshouses as everyone
else]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The root of the problem is that the systems
we depend on -- the lifeblood of the modern world -- are not built to
besecure.11This notion of offense and defense in cyber security is worth
teasing out. Offense involves exploiting systems, penetrating systems
with cyberattacks and generally leveraging broken software to compromise
entire systems and systems of systems.12 Conversely, defense means
building secure software, designing and engineering systems to be secure
in the ﬁrst place, and creating incentives and rewards for systems that
are built to be secure.13 What sometimes passes for cyber defense today
-- actively watching for intrusions, blocking attacks with network
technologies such as ﬁrewalls, law enforcement activities, and
protecting against malicious software with anti-virus technology -- is
little more than a cardboard shield.14 [[If we do not focus more]{.mark}
attention [on]{.mark} real cyber [defense]{.mark} by building security
in, **[cyber war will be inevitable.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### China wont invade Taiwan

**[Lo 20]{.underline}** \-\-- Alex Lo has been a Post columnist since
2012, covering major issues affecting Hong Kong and the rest of China. A
journalist for 25 years, he has worked for various publications in Hong
Kong and Toronto as a news reporter and editor. He has also lectured in
journalism at the University of Hong Kong, "China invade Taiwan? You
must be joking", SCMP, Oct 24^th^ 2020,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3106893/china-invade-taiwan-you-must-be-joking?module=perpetual_scroll&pgtype=article&campaign=3106893

Suddenly, some very important people in the West are warning mainland
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} may [invade Taiwan]{.underline}. It reminds
me of other Western VIPs who thought the People's Liberation Army would
roll in the tanks at the height of violent unrest in Hong Kong last
year.

Back then, sensible local businesspeople and informed expatriate
commentators had argued otherwise. Doing so [would mean the PLA had to
take over the city, and]{.underline} Beijing [would have to take
ownership of all of the city's domestic problems.]{.underline}

Similarly, [[despite]{.underline}]{.mark} Beijing's [[sabre
rattling,]{.underline}]{.mark} **[they [won't invade
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** without provocation. In any case, should
it happen, it wouldn't be an "invasion" but [[a civil
war]{.underline}]{.mark}, something that **[[strikes terror in the heart
of every Chinese.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Influential Financial Times columnist Gideon Rachman warned, though,
that "a distracted US is dangerous for Taiwan".

"The US is now consumed by the most divisive presidential election
campaign in living memory," he wrote. "Under these circumstances, the
Chinese government may doubt continuing American commitment to Taiwan.

"Beijing's window of opportunity could look even more tempting ...
particularly if the \[November\] election result is disputed and the
country is plunged into a political and constitutional crisis," he said.

Paul Wolfowitz, the former No. 2 at the Pentagon and the brain behind
the disastrous Iraq invasion and occupation, wrote in The Wall Street
Journal: "A Chinese invasion would present the greatest threat to global
peace in a generation ... \[The US must\] deter the threat by committing
to oppose it, by force if necessary."

Wolfowitz never seems to learn from history or his own disastrous role
in it. I bet, though, that [the Chinese have]{.underline} [learned
from]{.underline} the [Vietnam]{.underline} war, [and]{.underline} the
[Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline} aftermaths, just as they did from the
collapse of Soviet communism.

[[If a Taiwan "invasion" is difficult]{.underline}, **[pacification and
occupation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the island afterwards [would be
**much worse**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} [Taiwan is more than twice the

#### Deterrence not key to prevent Taiwan war

**[Lungu 21]{.underline}** \-\-- Andrei Lungu is president of The
Romanian Institute for the Study of the Asia-Pacific (RISAP), "Taiwan
invasion doesn't hang in the military balance", East Asia Forum, Aug
19^th^ 2021,
https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/08/19/taiwan-invasion-doesnt-hang-in-the-military-balance/

[There is growing speculation]{.underline} and alarm about a possible
Chinese invasion of Taiwan after Beijing sharpened its rhetoric towards
the Taiwanese government and increased its military manoeuvres around
the territory. The Biden administration is worried [that if Chinese
leaders are overconfident in China's growing power and assume
Washington's decline, they might decide to invade Taiwan.]{.underline}

[The US government has taken numerous actions to]{.underline} clearly
[signal its capacity and commitment]{.underline} to defend Taiwan.
Growing diplomatic engagement with Taiwan, increased military
manoeuvres, joint statements alongside Japan, South Korea and the G7,
[as well as developing a common response to a war over Taiwan with Japan
and Australia]{.underline} are all part of this new framework.

Although these actions intend to decrease the risk of military conflict
by strengthening military deterrence, they **[are
unlikely]{.underline}** to achieve it. This is because [[Beijing's
Taiwan calculus]{.underline}]{.mark} --- which [**[has always been more
complex]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}]{.mark} simply focussing on
[[the]{.mark} conventional [military balance]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[[involves]{.mark} three **[distinct factors]{.mark}** that have
dissuaded a Chinese invasion.]{.underline}

[The first is military power. [Chinese leaders still doubt whether China
could defeat]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[then conquer
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, let alone successfully fight the United
States.

[[Second]{.mark}ly, [there is an understanding that war over Taiwan
would portend]{.mark} disastrous [consequences for China's
economy]{.mark},]{.underline} foreign [[relations and global
image]{.mark}.]{.underline} Worse still, [a conflict could [pose]{.mark}
an [existential]{.mark} risk [to the **C**]{.mark}hinese
**[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty]{.underline}: [[a war]{.mark}
would mean [fighting]{.mark} and [killing 'brothers and
sisters']{.mark}, while defeat would bring echos of 1895. A war would
also undermine economic development --- a pressing goal]{.underline}
that is closely linked to the 'great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation'.

[[The third factor is **time**]{.underline}. [Chinese
leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} wait based on the [[hope]{.mark} that
'[peaceful reunification' is]{.mark} still
[possible]{.mark}]{.underline} and that **[time is on their
side]{.underline}**, as China's power is growing. [Their historical goal
has been to **prevent independence**]{.underline} or a change of the
status quo. [[Waiting]{.underline}]{.mark} still [**[makes
sense]{.underline}**,]{.mark} as China is pursuing its decades-long
military modernisation process.

By [[ignoring these last two]{.mark} factors]{.underline}, Washington
[[risks]{.underline}]{.mark} focussing [too much on the [assumption that
Chinese leaders]{.mark} have [become overconfident about]{.mark} the
**[erosion of military deterrence.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[Fear of the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [was **never the**]{.mark} **sole
[factor]{.mark}** preventing a Chinese invasion in the first
place.]{.underline}

[Hong Kong illustrates this thinking well]{.underline}. Without having
to contend with the possibility of an opposing military, [Beijing
remained acutely aware of the economic and diplomatic consequences
of]{.underline} sending military or paramilitary [troops to]{.underline}
directly [suppress protests. It instead adopted a slower strategy of
tightening control to reduce the political costs of its
actions.]{.underline}

Beijing only imposed national security legislation on Hong Kong when the
problem had gotten 'out of hand' --- not as a proactive measure. [The
Chinese leadership tried to gradually build control over the territory
for years]{.underline}, believing time was on its side. It only
implemented radical measures when it believed the status quo was
changing to its detriment.

[Chinese leaders]{.underline} haven't yet decided that an invasion of
Taiwan is unavoidable because they still [hope that 'peaceful
reunification' is achievable]{.underline}, but they worry about Taiwan's
steady drift towards the United States. Beijing sees Washington's
growing ties with Taiwan as undermining the status quo and diminishing
the prospects for 'peaceful reunification'.

Such discussions have been kicking around for years, but many [[cyber
experts remain deeply skeptical that]{.underline}]{.mark} such [an
[agreement could be **reached**, let alone
**enforced**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Cyber strikes are low-cost and high-reward

[[The first big challenge]{.mark} would be simply getting everyone to
agree]{.underline} to the rules. [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, China,
Iran and North Korea [have all been blamed for significant hacks against
the U.S.,]{.underline} and analysts say those countries see cyber
strikes as cheap, effective and easy to deny.

[[It\'s not]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[clear]{.underline}]{.mark} if
[[such countries would be willing to **actually agree to
terms**]{.mark}, because cyber attacks for them [are]{.mark} \"really
[useful in their **geopolitical positioning**]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
April Falcon Doss, a former National Security Agency official who now
heads a technology program at Georgetown\'s law school, tells NPR.

Compared to the arms agreements between the U.S. and Soviet Union, [[a
cyber treaty would be]{.mark} extremely [difficult to]{.mark} monitor
and [enforce]{.mark}.]{.underline} That\'s because the [production,
development and stockpiling of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
is fundamentally different from]{.underline} the ephemeral nature of
[cyber weapons]{.underline}, says Doss.

\"If the question is whether or not a signatory to a nuclear arms
control treaty is building up their nuclear stockpile, there will almost
certainly be some evidence, factory production, storage of nuclear
weapons,\" she says. \"There will be satellite imagery or there will be
on the ground reports.\"

Tests of nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles, such as those carried
out by North Korea in recent years, are also relatively simple to
monitor compared to the challenge of keeping an eye on the dark corners
of the Internet to track down new cyber weapons, Doss says.

\"[[Detecting]{.mark} their [development is]{.mark} much [hard]{.mark}er
[because you don\'t have big stockpiles]{.mark}]{.underline} of missiles
sitting around and there\'s nothing that\'s visible in that sense,\" she
says.

Ethics of Securitization

As discussed in the literature review, [[securitization]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most [often [discussed as a
'**negative'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [concept]{.underline} for several
reasons. First of all, securitization argues that the normal democratic
procedures for decision makers be abandoned in favor of a streamlined
decision-making process handled by a small elite that dictate policy on
security related issues. [Critics assert that securitization
is]{.underline} something largely [inconsistent with the openness and
accountability that]{.underline} [liberal democratic systems
value]{.underline}, [therefore]{.underline} securitization [is something
'negative' to be avoided]{.underline} in societies that place true
importance on these values. [But [what if **the issue**]{.mark} **being
securitized** [is a **direct threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} those very [democratic procedures themselves. Are there
issues [that **deserve to be securitized**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[for the **common good**]{.underline}, [and can government
policies have a **positive impact on society** when these issues are
**securitized?**]{.underline}

[Experts on **disinformation**]{.underline} [warn of the **dire
potential** that such **propaganda** can have on a society]{.underline},
and argue that liberal democracies are especially vulnerable to them.
New technologies have made the 21st century into a completely different
type of information space than its predecessor. [The internet has
decentralized and democratized the flow of information]{.underline} to
the point where somebody sitting on a laptop at home may be able to make
the same impact with a blog as a major newspaper with an article. [With
less institutional control and traditional media gatekeeping on the flow
of information, the internet is a **truly democratic
platform**]{.underline}.148 These democratic processes; freedom of
information, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free
elections; are precisely what make liberal democracies so vulnerable to
disinformation and propaganda. With knowledge of these asymmetric
vulnerabilities[, the Kremlin **consciously aims** "to **take
advantage** of the **free flow of information** in a democratic society,
the **effect of that information on public opinion**, and the
**electoral mechanisms**]{.underline} [through which public opinion
determines a country's leadership]{.underline}."149

[One foundation of a democratic society is the ability to make decisions
in the public forum **based on shared truth**.]{.underline} When voters
go to the polls, they may make a judgement on which candidate or which
proposal they favor based on the information that they have consumed.
Traditionally, they may differ on what course of action may be the best
way to handle a problem, but there is an agreed upon reality that is a
matter of fact; it is shared. [Disinformation, from Russia and other
actors hostile to the West, **promotes falsehoods** to the point where
society **cannot have a shared truth**.]{.underline} Imagine four people
each with a different source of news. One reads the New York Times, one
watches Fox News, one reads Breitbart, and one watches RT. Each one of
these people will not only come to radically different conclusions about
what solutions are best for society, but also about what the basic facts
of reality are in the first place. One person may be out on the streets
protesting the disappearance and rape of a young Russian girl by Muslim
migrants, while the next person may be aware that the story is a
complete falsehood that never happened to begin with. [[Russian
efforts]{.mark} in the EU [show]{.mark} that [these situations **are
not**]{.mark} **a hysterical [fear-mongering]{.mark} reaction to new
technologies**]{.underline} and new sources of information,
[[but]{.mark} that they are **already a [reality]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Disinfo]{.mark}rmation [creates]{.mark} a situation where people can
have **[opposing realities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [because the
information they consume is **so radically different**]{.underline}
[from that of their neighbor.]{.underline} [**[Critical theory]{.mark}**
in international relations **[warns]{.mark}** that
[securitization]{.mark} **[subverts]{.mark} democratic
[decision-making]{.mark} processes**]{.underline}, [[but
**disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation** [**destroys** these]{.mark} very
democratic [processes]{.mark}]{.underline} that are so fundamental for
liberal democratic societies to function the way they are intended. It
is impossible to imagine normal democratic processes solving these types
of problems when those processes are being eroded by propaganda to the
point where Western societies may no longer have normal democratic
processes if this trend continues. In order to maintain these democratic
norms, [securitization may be a **necessary**]{.underline} [process,
even a 'positive' concept that can yield positive results]{.underline}
and protect the democratic values that have propelled the European
project into existence.

From the perspective of states, it is difficult to see why they would
not wish to securitize the issue of Russian disinformation more. States
tend to place an emphasis on matters of physical and territorial
security over all else, which is why issues such as nuclear weapons, or
rising military power in China, or international terrorism are
prioritized in terms of security policy. States' desire for physical
security explains why these issues tend to be some of the most
securitized political issues, with decisions made regarding military
policy in Afghanistan by military panels rather than public referendums.
Walt, arguing from the realist perspective, argues that states "place
particular emphasis on the preservation of the state's territorial
integrity and the physical safety of its inhabitants." 150 Material harm
is of the utmost importance while more ethereal issues, like democratic
procedures, freedom of the information space, and societal resilience
towards propaganda are not prioritized in the same way. Disinformation
has threatened some of the building blocks of democratic societies
throughout the EU, and if these democratic systems fail, it isn't
difficult to imagine that physical security would come under threat as
well. In the case of Spain, the issue of the Spanish government's
territorial sovereignty over Catalonia was attacked by Russian
disinformation, exacerbating the political wounds of the independence
referendum. The disinformation campaign questioned Spain's fundamental
right to exist in its current form, yet Spain did not place the
integrity of their media space as an important security issue despite
this. There needs to be a shift in the importance and value that
European democracies place on the fundamental democratic principles that
allow their system to flourish. They should be prioritized with the same
importance that states place on more traditional measures of power.
Securitization of disinformation with the liberal democratic system and
democratic processes themselves as the referent object, has the
potential to have a more 'positive' outcome than emphasis on hard power,
or immigration, or other issues that contribute to the 'negative'
conception of securitization.

Successful Securitization and Societal Resilience

In the case studies it is clear that [some European countries have
securitized Russian disinformation while some have not.]{.underline}
Namely, the United Kingdom and Lithuania have successfully securitized
disinformation, while Spain, Germany, and the supranational institutions
of the EU have not securitized disinformation. Those that have not
securitized, have identified Russian disinformation as a perceived
security threat and have several securitizing actors currently at play.
The potential audiences of the securitizing speech acts, those within
the security apparatus, NGOs, think-tanks, and even the wider public of
these countries have accepted that Russian disinformation is a security
threat that warrants greater action by their governments. Thus far, they
have not taken measures that could by any means be considered
extraordinary, having allocated a relatively small number of resources
and minimal effort towards combating disinformation, and therefore
cannot be considered to have securitized the issue. These countries, and
the EU, are possibly in the early stages of the process of
securitization, though this does not necessarily mean that they will
complete the process by taking more extraordinary measures against
disinformation. In fact, there could be a reversal and disinformation
could slip back into the realm of normal politics and become
desecuritized.

Some [clear trends emerge in the countries who have **successfully
securitized disinformation**]{.underline}. First[, propaganda narratives
have a **weaker effect on society** when disinformation **has been
securitized**,]{.underline} [**failing to have their desired
impact**]{.underline} and cause major rifts in the public. They also
show that [securitization of disinformation is possible **without**
implicitly **violating** democratic norms of freedom of speech and open
access to information]{.underline}. This becomes clear in looking at the
contrast between Lithuania's countermeasures against disinformation
compared to those of Germany and Spain. In Germany, the Lisa case was
dealt with almost exclusively via the normal criminal and legal
channels, with the police investigation into Lisa's accusations of
kidnap and rape by migrants and police handling of most public
statements related to the controversy. 151 They have begun to enact
minor laws that aim at punishing hate speech and disinformation when
posted on popular social media platforms as well.152 Spanish authorities
have started task forces devoted to alerting the national government
when disinformation narratives start to dominate a story online. 153
Spanish and German officials at the higher levels of national authority
in their respective foreign and defense departments gave minimal
statements regarding the controversies, and have preferred to continue
dealing with Russia through dialogue over more overt confrontation that
could complicate communication. Both Germany and Spain have taken a more
reactive approach to countering disinformation, choosing to deal with it
on a case-by-case basis as an incident unfolds.

Lithuania has taken similar messages to alert national authorities on
dangerous narratives as they develop online, but it has also taken
extraordinary measures that encompass a broader scope. The Lithuanian
government has supported efforts at every level of society; political,
economic, educational, and cultural. 154 Their wide spread programs
focus not only on dealing with each case as it emerges, but also on
strengthening the fundamental resilience of society at the source
through teaching media literacy in secondary schools, funding Russian
language media for the susceptible minority group, and sensitizing the
public to the dangers of propaganda by making disinformation a security
issue linked to the physical security and existence of the state.155
Their bans on Russian media channels during disinformation campaigns,
while possibly construed as violations of a free press, are necessary to
prevent media from spreading out right falsehoods. The news media, both
Lithuanian and Russian language, should be held accountable and has a
responsibility to act as a gatekeeper of the truth. Many media channels
in Lithuania have voluntarily chosen to follow such a route, choosing
not to report on 'fake' news stories that can be detrimental to society
by becoming 'real' news through regurgitation by legitimate media
outlets. It is important not to confuse the right of free speech of an
individual with that of a news organization with ties to a foreign
country, and such acts should not be considered violations of democratic
norms when it comes to protecting the fundamental values of democracy.

[The **countermeasures** taken by a country]{.underline} undoubtedly
[play a role in the **impact** disinformation narratives may have in
that country. With Lithuania's '**successful' securitization** of
disinformation]{.underline}, [**fake stories** and attempts at
**propaganda** have often **fallen on deaf ears**]{.underline}, with
little real success. [Lithuania's overarching, comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation is the **reason** the NATO rape
allegations]{.underline} **[failed to cause a large
disruption]{.underline}** [in the news cycle.]{.underline}156 [This
**strong contrast** is seen with Germany, where the story of a rape by
migrants of a young Russian girl caused an **uproar** and **led to
protests in Berlin**]{.underline} [and a **diplomatic row with
Moscow**]{.underline}. 157 Spain also fell short, with Russian
disinformation exacerbating a contentious independence referendum in
Catalonia and influencing public opinion at home and abroad on the
status of Catalan autonomy. [[Government policies that **fail to
securitize** ]{.mark}**disinformation** and **alert
society**]{.underline} [to the **dangers of propaganda**]{.underline}
[[lead to **false stories** having **explosive
consequences**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Both Spain and Germany's strategies of dealing with disinformation
narratives as they arise is simply not effective enough. The state can
spend time and resources trying to discredit every fake news story that
finds its way to the public forum, but there will always be one to take
its place. It is like fire prevention; a fire alarm can be an important
part of fire prevention, alerting the fire department to come extinguish
a blaze. But there are more important measures as well, such as building
structures with fire resistant materials, or teaching people what to do
in case of a fire. These types of continuous measures, like the policies
Lithuania pursues, make society more resilient and prevent
disinformation from causing a fire in the first place.

[Policies aimed at improving societal resilience towards disinformation
are being utilized in other countries with successful outcomes as
well]{.underline}. Latvia uses a sweeping media literacy program from an
early age to improve critical thinking in its citizens.158 Finland, a
country with a long history of hostility with Russia, uses similar
programs, emphasizing not only the need to publicly correct false
narratives, but also the importance of creating a positive
counternarrative to disinformation that is repeatedly applied to offer
an alternative vision.159 [These countermeasures **only appear** in
countries that have **securitized disinformation**]{.underline}, as
Finland and Latvia have similar histories as Lithuania and treat
disinformation in similar terms, and they are much more promising than
government authorities attempting to play catchup with internet trolls
and false stories.

Internationalization of Countermeasures

Another key conclusion comes from the other [case of successful
securitization in the United Kingdom. The UK, in its **securitization of
disinformation**]{.underline} [following the assassination attempt on
Sergei Skripal, **internationalized the threat**]{.underline} [by
creating a set of countermeasures]{.underline} [that could be
implemented **along with its allies**]{.underline}. The UK successfully
convinced 20 allies to expel Russian diplomats in a coordinated effort
at punishing Putin's regime for the incident and the subsequent
disinformation surrounding it.160 [Theresa May, as a securitizing actor,
not only convinced her public in the UK of disinformation as a security
threat,]{.underline} [but **convinced the international
community**]{.underline} [that such behavior "**threatens the security
of us all**]{.underline}." 161 Compared with the minimal Spanish
attempts at coordinating counter disinformation at the EU level, and
German attempts to keep the Lisa Case under the authority of Berlin's
police department[, British efforts at securitizing their incident by
bringing it to the **attention of the international community** and
launching a **unified response** were **highly
successful.**]{.underline}

This lesson of internationalization should be critical for the EU to
deal with disinformation. [[Securitization needs to take place]{.mark}
not only at the **national level** of member]{.underline} [states, but
also [at the **supranational level**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of
the EU as an institution. The EU itself is under threat of Russian
disinformation just as much as individual member states, with experts
warning of further regionalization of Europe and the EU after Brexit. In
this critical time for the continued existence of the EU, [the threat of
disinformation "[requires]{.mark} new [international instruments]{.mark}
to manage it." 162 Thus far, member states have shown a preference for
taking **individual routes**]{.underline} in order to deal with
disinformation. [The importance **of joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[could be especially important during **elections**]{.underline}, a time
in which the ability of national and EU authorities to cooperate is
critical. During the European elections of 2019 for example, consisting
of four days of simultaneous elections across 28 individual member
states, "the failure of one government to properly mitigate
disinformation efforts threatens the credibility of the entire electoral
process." 163 This problem of coordination cannot be understated, as
some countries do not even have their own systems in place to monitor
disinformation, allowing "local and national actors to spread fake news
more freely" and leaving these countries defenseless against
propaganda.164

[It is essential]{.underline} for the EU [to act as a
**bloc**]{.underline} [and start **joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[counter disinformation]{.underline}**. [Russian
efforts]{.underline}, as shown in the case studies, are not exclusive to
one particular area of Europe, but **[threaten all member
states]{.underline}**. Issues Russia chooses to target; the migrant
crisis, espionage, the use of chemical weapons in a member state, the
solidarity and legitimacy of the NATO, and even the territorial
sovereignty of some countries; should alarm every single member of the
EU. These issues are not unique to one country, but they are issues that
countries even outside of the EU are currently confronting. Europe is
targeted as a bloc, and therefore it should respond as a bloc. Such a
response, as seen in with the UK's diplomatic expulsion, has a larger
impact as a bloc rather than individually. Division will only encourage
more provocations. [Acting on a **unified front** in securitizing
disinformation and reacting with countermeasures will do much more
[to]{.mark} potentially **[deter Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
continuing down the same path in its relations with Europe. The EU needs
to stop hesitating, and start throwing its full weight on the economic,
political, and informational fronts.

'Positive' Securitization

The two [trends discussed in the sections above also show that
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation [can be securitized **without**]{.mark} **wide
[violations of democratic norms]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
**[exclusionary tactics]{.underline}** [towards Russian minorities in
Europe]{.underline}. [By arguing for securitization, this paper is not
arguing that democratic principles should be **thrown out** in favor of
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline} [that subvert the democratic
process]{.underline}, indeed the democratic process is of the utmost
importance because these principles are the referent object of a
European push to securitize disinformation. [And according to
polls]{.underline} in all of the countries involved in the case studies
and the EU as a whole, [the general public agrees that disinformation
**constitutes a security threat**]{.underline} that could be detrimental
to liberal democratic norms. Efforts like media literacy, cooperation
with news organizations, and comprehensive strategies that deal with
disinformation at every level of society are still extraordinary without
necessarily violating democratic norms. These [[policies]{.mark} [aim to
**sensitize the public** ]{.mark}**to
disinformation**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They **do [not]{.mark}** aim
[to]{.mark} **[monitor]{.mark} the public [in a surveillance
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and]{.underline} **[punish
individual views]{.underline}** that are unfavorable to European states.
[On the other hand, these policies are not afraid to prevent large news
outlets from **spreading lies** that harm the ability to make democratic
decisions **based on shared truths.**]{.underline} [Diplomatic expulsion
and unprecedented international cooperation on information issues are
extraordinary]{.underline} [measures taken **without abuse of state
power**]{.underline} [as in the **War on Terror**]{.underline}.
[Policies that aim to provide alternative news sources to Russian
speaking minorities in Europe **are not** **exclusionary
'othering**]{.underline},' [but are **inclusive**]{.underline} [and
offer a **broader**, **diverse**, and]{.underline} **[more
positive]{.underline}** [view]{.underline} [of the Russian diaspora than
as a monolithic fifth-column prone to side with Moscow and Putin's
regime over their new homes.]{.underline} These policies need to be
inclusive to mitigate the risk of disinformation and the subsequent
disillusion with European governments. A conscious, just policy of
securitization of disinformation must take democratic principles,
inclusion of diverse viewpoints, and the treatment of Russian minorities
into account while avoiding the misuse of state power in order to
succeed.

#### Hybrid warfare disrupts NATO's ontological security\-\--reproduces the narrative of the "other" and turns the K\-\--strengthening collective identity solves

and physical security," Journal of International Relations and
Development volume 18, pages52--74 (2015),

[With regard to ontological security, the distinction between security
and insecurity is]{.underline} the more **[critical]{.underline}** one.
[In a state of **ontological insecurity,**]{.underline} [the Self
experiences **instability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[uncertainty of being]{.underline}**. [Ontological insecurity refers
to a]{.underline} [state of **disruption**]{.underline} [where the Self
has **lost its anchor**]{.underline} [for the definition of its
identity]{.underline} [and,]{.underline} consequently, [its ability to
sustain a narrative and answer questions about doing, acting, and being
(]{.underline}Kinnvall 2004). It may arise from deep uncertainty (Mitzen
2006a) and/or from the failure to have its sense of Self affirmed by
others (Zarakol 2010). [Conversely, in a state of ontological security,
the Self experiences a **stable**, **certain**, and **consistent**
social existence]{.underline}, [where it remains in control about its
identity and capacity for action]{.underline}. While I do not rule out
the possibility of a state of ontological asecurity, where the Self is
simply not concerned with the stability and certainty of its identity, I
do not explore this possibility and how it varies across different
states of physical security in this article.

Having identified different states of physical and ontological security,
I make the further assumption that [since **ontological** and
**physical** security]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}**, [states of security do not vary
**uniformly** across the ontological and physical layers of
security.]{.underline} [One can be at a state of physical insecurity
while being at a state of ontological security, and vice
versa.]{.underline} Consequently, Table 1 charts out the four possible
states of security based on the conception of security as both
ontological and physical.

[The [state of **ontological
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[/[physical
(in)security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} one [where]{.mark} [the
Self experiences concern about]{.mark} **[physical
harm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and uncertainty [of its
**being**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ontological insecurity **tempts
actors** to engage in practices that mark Others as not only
**different**]{.underline}, [but also as **morally
inferior**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[threatening]{.underline}**
(Campbell 1992). **[[Ontological]{.mark} insecurity [and physical
(in)security reproduce one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[As actors
**seek ontological security**]{.mark} [through **constructing Others
as**]{.mark} **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to their
security-as-survival]{.underline}, [[they **mobilise**]{.mark} **their
[physical defences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[pursuit of
physical security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through representing the
sources of threat as **different** and **morally
inferior.**]{.underline}

[Similarly, in a state of ontological security/physical (in)security,
actors experience stability and certainty of being in a relationship
where the Other is constructed as threat to their security-as-survival.
Consequently, they remain locked]{.underline} [into]{.underline}
**[conflict-producing routines]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[maintain their certainty of being]{.underline}** (Mitzen 2006a). In
protracted conflicts such as in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine, this state
of security sustains a stable Self/Other relationship based on enemy
roles. [When in such a state of security, minority and majority groups,
migrants and host societies perceive and represent each other's
identities as radically different and inherently incompatible, and
reproduce these perceptions and representations through acts of
securitisation]{.underline} [in order to **ensure their ontological
security**.]{.underline} The states of ontological insecurity/physical
(in)security and ontological security/physical (in)security are both
securitised states; however, whereas the former compels actors to
construct new narratives of difference and threat and engage in the
securitisation of new issues to regain their certainty and stability of
being, the latter compels actors to reproduce the existing narratives
and continue the securitisation of existing differences and conflicts to
maintain it.

[[The state of **ontological security**/**physical asecurity**
is]{.mark} certainly **the [most attractive]{.mark} state of
security**]{.underline} [from a **normative**]{.underline} [point of
view]{.underline}. [[**Security communities** in i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations]{.underline}, and in particular, the European non-war
community (Wæver 1998) and the Nordic community (Browning and Joenniemi
2012) [[constitute the best examples]{.mark} of such a state of security
in international relations.]{.underline} [[A **collective identity
discourse**]{.underline} [makes it possible]{.underline} ]{.mark}[for
states in security communities [to maintain]{.mark} the [us/them]{.mark}
[distinctions]{.mark}, which are]{.underline}
[**[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
**certainty** and **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
being]{.underline}]{.mark}, [while remaining in a state of **physical
asecurity** vis-à-vis one another]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006b; Browning
and Joenniemi 2012). [[In this state]{.mark} of security, **[conflicts
are sustainably resolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [issues that have
propelled conflict in the past are either **settled**]{.underline} [or
have **[shed]{.mark} their [physical
security-ness]{.mark},**]{.underline} [and are negotiated in normal
political channels]{.underline}. Yet, identity differences maintain
their ontological security-ness as groups reproduce their distinct
identities through various social and cultural practices.

#### Hybrid warfare [disrupts]{.underline} NATO's [ontological security]{.underline}\-\--contingency planning [solves]{.underline} by [isolating NATO]{.underline} from [existential fear]{.underline}

Security at the Brussels School of International Studies, University of

[Hybrid warfare indicates a **multitude** of possible
**contingencies**]{.underline}, [generating anxiety about one's ability
to **remain oneself**]{.underline} and to continue to act. [It is thus
linked to "anxiety over the **vulnerability of \[Western\]
power**]{.underline}" (Bell 2012, pp. 230--231), [threatening the West
about losing its particularistic **form of existence**]{.underline} (cf.
Creppell 2011, p. 455). Anxiety, in contrast to fear, which per Giddens
(1991, p. 43) constitutes a response to a specific threat, concerns
"perceived threats to the integrity of the security system of the
individual" (Giddens 1991, pp. 44--45, cf. Browning and Joenniemi 2017,
p. 38; Rumelili 2015). [OS-seeking aims to **mitigate the effects** of
such hard uncertainty, **bringing it within bearable
limits**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 346). **[Routines]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[instrumental]{.underline}** [here, as they
"**pacify the cognitive environment**]{.underline} ... '**[inoculating'
individuals against paralytic, deep fear of chaos]{.underline}**"
(Mitzen 2006, p. 347).

[Being able to **survive** the "hybrid threats" is **directly
pertinent** to the survival of]{.underline} the EU and
**[NATO]{.underline}** [as particular kinds of organisations,
underpinned and **driven by specific values**]{.underline} -- [which
cannot be sacrificed or diluted in the struggle for physical and
institutional survival]{.underline}. [Yet, hybrid warfare disturbs **the
OS**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline} in
subtly distinct ways. Due to the particularities of their institutional
set-ups and historical foundations, the OS drives of the two
organisations are somewhat distinctive. NATO's history is occasionally
told through its surpassing of a sequence of crises, albeit the end of
the Cold War and the collapse of its original enemy created a situation
of unprecedented uncertainty and ontological insecurity for the
Alliance. Meanwhile, the EU's ontological insecurity is a more recent
phenomenon, stemming mostly from the Eurocrisis and the looming
possibility of a Grexit a few years ago; the refugee/migration crisis in
Europe of 2015 (Dingott Alkhoper 2018; Mitzen 2018); the actual UK
decision on Brexit in 2016 (Browning 2018); and the rise of populist
politics within the EU (Kinnvall, Manners, Mitzen 2018) and the United
States. [NATO as a military alliance has been historically more
accustomed to the othering practices of **concrete geographical
places**]{.underline}, whereas the EU is generally regarded as an
organisation that has risen above geopolitical othering, juxtaposing
itself to Europe's dark past instead (Rumelili 2018, Subotic 2018, and
Della Sala 2018). Accordingly, the EU might be more at home with hybrid
threat management due to its historically broader conceptualisation of
security through the paradigm of intertwined risks rather than being
focused more strictly on "the threat, use and control of military force"
in the manner of a traditional defence alliance (Walt 1991, p. 212;
Manners 2002). Regardless of its perpetual transformer's self-image,
[[hybrid threats represent]{.mark} the uncomfortable "hard" or
"[**fundamental**" uncertainty for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Mitzen
2006, p. 346) [[and are]{.mark} thus [**ontologically disturbing** for
the security of **its self** as a **traditional alliance**]{.mark} [with
a **collective security pledge** bound to **"armed
attack"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against one or more of its member
states]{.underline}.

[[In order to achieve OS, actors strive for **"routinizing**
]{.mark}**their [relations with]{.mark} significant
[others"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 342).
**[[Routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [help to **[keep ontological fears
at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [out of **everyday discursive
consciousness**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 348). From this
perspective, NATO's naming and shaming strategy vis-à-vis Russia as part
of its hybrid warfare countering strategy links the uncertainty
emanating from the hybrid nature of the new threats to the known and
routine relationship with its traditional antagonist.8 The
incapacitating [[difficulties related to **planning ahead**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**anticipating** and]{.underline}
[**[countering]{.underline}** [hybrid engagements
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [somewhat
**[alleviated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} latter's [attachment to a **known
rival**]{.underline}. [Russia's hybrid intervention in Ukraine has
concurrently provided NATO with the familiar parameters of the cognitive
"cocoon]{.underline}" (Giddens 1991, pp. 39--40) [which enables the
alliance to **reproduce its cognitively "knowable" world**]{.underline}.
A Mitzenian reading of NATO's emerging response to hybrid
threats/warfare thus points at the renewed routinisation of the
"programmed cognitive and behavioral responses" to Russia as the
alliance's original nemesis.

Restoring traditional vigilance vis-à-vis Russia, buttressing the
forward defence along the Alliance's eastern flank with the respective
military reinforcements, **[[contingency planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and exercises, [the emerging response of NATO to the hybrid menace could
also be read [as a]{.mark}n []{.mark}**attempted [restoration of a known
normative order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the North Atlantic
Alliance]{.underline}. [Hybrid warfare endangers the basic features of
the said normative order]{.underline} (or that of the broadly conceived
Western security community in general, including the EU as well) as its
efficient countering would likely compromise the underlying principles
for this order's particularistic existence (cf. Creppell 2011, p. 450).
As a threat of subversion, [hybrid warfare exposes the internal
vulnerabilities in the body of the traditional security alliance
(NATO)]{.underline} and a self-proclaimed post-modern security actor
(i.e. the EU; cf. Cooper 2004). This concerns, in particular, the
ever-elusive (and contested) balance between national/organisational
security and individual liberties (cf. Waldron 2003, Neocleous 2007), as
strategic communication is inherently at odds with free speech as a core
value of Western liberalism. Countering hybrid warfare is conducive of
generating a security predicament of perpetual pre-emption which, by
definition, would indicate pre-emptive gathering of all sorts of data,
thus likely infringing on the privacy of the individuals for the sake of
the organisational/regional/national security. This precautionary logic
resonates with the risk society approach which characterises the
struggling with a sheer volume of risks with potentially fundamental
consequences as a key feature of modernity, implying that "decisions are
... made not in context of certainty, nor even of available knowledge,
but of doubt, premonition, foreboding, challenge, mistrust, fear, and
anxiety" (Ewald 2002, p. 294).

Conclusion

This thesis aimed to identify similar processes occurring throughout the
EU by analyzing how four individual member states have approached the
issue of disinformation. In looking at incidents of disinformation in
the UK, Germany, Lithuania, and Spain, research was conducted to analyze
the incidents themselves and how governments responded, placing that
response into the wider context of securitization within those
countries. It is clear that [there is an **ongoing process of
securitization** taking place in Europe around the issue of
**disinformation**]{.underline}. [Not all countries]{.underline}
researched [have demonstrated that disinformation has been **fully
securitized**]{.underline}, but every country had elements of
securitization taking place, such as securitizing actors and speech acts
meant to draw attention to propaganda as an existential security threat.
While these countries did show the initial factors in securitization
occurring, they chose to deal with disinformation through the route of
normal politics rather than extraordinary politics. It can be concluded
that [the]{.underline} [**[level of securitization]{.underline}** [of
Russian disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} **[within a
society]{.underline}**, [that is the treatment of propaganda and false
narratives as a security threat and how deep a country is within the
process of securitization, [played]{.mark} a **direct [role]{.mark}**
[in **shaping**]{.mark} **the [policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [those
countries pursued in order to **counter disinformation**]{.underline}.

Examining the different cases, the research showed how history,
experience, and threat perceptions related to Russia influenced
securitization of disinformation. The United Kingdom securitized Russian
disinformation in the aftermath of a catalyst event, the attempted
assassination of former GRU agent Sergei Skripal and the subsequent
disinformation campaign in its aftermath. The UK government propelled
disinformation to extraordinary politics in its diplomatic expulsion of
Russian diplomats coordinated with its allies. Lithuania securitized
Russian disinformation over a long period of time because of its complex
history with Russia and the Soviet Union, and its experience of a slow
barrage of disinformation since it regained independence. Due to decades
of experience, Lithuania pursues a more comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation, which seeks to address the threat at multiple
levels of society and multiple stages as false-narratives spread.

It was clear that other countries, and the EU as an organization, had
not fully securitized Russian disinformation, although they showed signs
they were in the process of securitization. Germany, in response to a
young girl's explosive accusations of rape in the context of the migrant
crisis, showed a clear preference for dealing with disinformation
through the normal political channels of Berlin's police department.
Spain took minimal responses through its foreign and defense ministries
and is still in the early stages of instituting policies aimed at
alerting the government to disinformation narratives. As a bloc, the EU
also failed to enact extraordinary policies to counteract disinformation
from Europe's Eastern neighbor, with a lack of coordination between the
individual member states and the supranational EU bodies.

[While some countries have securitized disinformation, other have chosen
a different route, and]{.underline} we can see how the **[different
policies]{.underline}** [enacted by these countries can either **protect
society**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[make society more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. [Those [countries that]{.mark} have
**[securitized disinformation]{.mark}** have]{.underline} also
[[had]{.mark} the **most [success]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[countering]{.mark} [it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Continuous [policies
that]{.mark}]{.underline} not only track disinformation narratives and
discredit them as they emerge on a case-by-case basis, but also
[**[build resilience]{.mark}** at the source through]{.underline}
[policy efforts]{.underline} in the social, cultural, educational, and
political realm [[have **proven more effective**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Media literacy, Russian language programming, and public statements
exposing false stories can all have an impact. [[Disinformation
narratives]{.mark} have often [failed to cause]{.mark} the
same]{.underline} **[[explosive consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
those countries that have instituted]{.underline} **[comprehensive
strategies]{.underline}** [to counter it.]{.underline}
**[[Internationalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
counterdisinformation policies]{.underline}, **[[seeking
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} [joint]{.underline}
[initiatives [with]{.mark} **like-minded [allies]{.mark},**]{.underline}
[has also [proven]{.mark} more [effective]{.mark}]{.underline}
[cultivating societies that are **less vulnerable** to **fake
news**]{.underline}. Diplomatic expulsions, online tracking, and
coordinated alert systems have the potential to ensure that the more
vulnerable countries in the EU do not let disinformation exert influence
on political processes and thereby endanger the bloc as a whole.

[This [paper]{.mark} has also [argued against '**negative'**]{.mark}
**conceptions** of [securitization]{.mark} in relation to the issue of
disinformation]{.underline}. It has warned that [[disinformation
**is**]{.mark} **indeed [a security threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
liberal democracies in the West, [[with]{.mark} its [ability to
**destroy**]{.mark} **foundations of [shared
truth]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
~~cripple~~ \[**[destroy]{.underline}**\] [[democratic]{.mark}
decision-making [processes]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [While **critical
IR**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**theorists** believe]{.mark}
[securitization should be **avoided**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [protect openness and accountability, and frame the
process in a **negative light**]{.underline}, this paper has argued that
[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[is]{.mark} a **[necessary]{.mark} protective measure**]{.underline}
[[and **does not inherently lead to abuse of state
power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policies]{.mark} [pursued]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the case study [countries that]{.mark} have
**[successfully]{.mark} [securitized
disinformation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[prove that]{.mark} while still
**extraordinary**]{.underline}, [[countermeasures]{.mark} against
disinformation **[do not]{.mark} necessarily need to [violate]{.mark}
the [democratic values]{.mark} they are meant to protect.**]{.underline}
[These policies do not need to be **exclusive** towards Russian
minorities, but [can be **inclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[contribute to public life]{.underline}**. If
European countries and the EU as an institution value the democratic
principles that govern their societies, [a conscious, successful
securitization of disinformation may be beneficial and even have
'**positive' results**.]{.underline} [[**Viewing disinformation as a

#### Interoperability

\<cite\>

I[n the age of digitization, information systems play a]{.underline}
more integrated and [important role in modern society than ever before.
This also applies to critical infrastructures]{.underline} **[that are
essential for the functioning of society]{.underline}** today. At the
same time, however, [these systems are becoming increasingly **complex
and vulnerable to attacks**]{.underline}. It can be observed that
[today's systems are]{.underline} mostly [defended by traditional
security measures that only provide basic protection against common
threats]{.underline}. In contrast, [reliable protection of systems
against sophisticated and targeted attacks remains a problem and
continues to intensify the arms race between threat actors]{.underline}
on the one side [and security experts]{.underline} on the other**[. To
be ahead in this game]{.underline}**, [a trend towards the **exchange
of**]{.underline} Cyber Threat Intelligence (**[CTI]{.underline}**)
[info]{.underline}rmation [has emerged to be aware of threats at an
early stage. This can]{.underline} either **[strengthen threat
prevention]{.underline}** [or]{.underline} [contribute to the
**mitigation** of already occurred incidents and **improve the overall
system security.**]{.underline}

[The benefits of CTI exchanges are recognized and promoted by various
governments, industry and research.]{.underline} This has already led to
legal reporting obligations for industries that are relevant to the
functioning of the society in different economic areas such as the
United States1 , the European Union2 and Germany3 . At the same time,
the industry has started to introduce a wide range of threat
intelligence platforms such as the Collective Intelligence Framework
(CIF)4 and community solutions like Open Threat Exchange (OTX)5.

But [while sharing CTI **undoubtedly can create benefits,** there are
issues on how to]{.underline} conduct the [exchange]{.underline} of
threat [intelligence. The]{.underline} structure as well as the content
of threat intelligence reports ar**[e essential aspects]{.underline}**
[for a mutual understanding of the shared information and]{.underline},
therefore, [for the success of the exchange itself. To support the
exchange process]{.underline}, several [organizations have developed
**competing formats and standards**]{.underline} to represent CTI, which
are already used by companies to some extent. [The formats
differ]{.underline} in their focus on certain CTI areas, notations and
presentation concepts while actually serving similar purposes. [This can
lead to several issues, such as incompatibilities or comprehension
problems, which may even **question the whole**]{.underline} exchange
**[process]{.underline}**. **[Uniform definitions]{.underline}** and
notations and a common understanding of the data structures [is
therefore an important **success factor**]{.underline} [for the exchange
CTI information.]{.underline} With this work, we make the following
contributions as a step towards unification of CTI data structures:

-- We introduce a meta model that describes the key elements of threat
intelligence formats

-- [We propose a common notation for CTI base elements to support the
mutual understanding for available components]{.underline}

-- We apply our findings to a unified model, which serves as a basis for
the understanding and discussion of future opportunities in the area of
threat intelligence sharing

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we
cover the Related Work. Section 3 introduces a meta model and unified
notation for CTI data structures. Section 4 introduces a unified CTI
model based on the meta model and the unified notation as well as a
discussion about possible starting points for improving the current
situation based on this model. The paper is concluded in section 5.

#### Rift between NATO and EU

https://www.streitcouncil.org/post/bridging-the-transatlantic-cyber-rift-recommendations-for-improving-cyber-cooperation-between-nato

[Information-Sharing Issues]{.underline}

[Although NATO]{.underline} and the EU [have made great progress
improving cyber cooperation, issues with sharing
information]{.underline} -- **[particularly classified
information]{.underline}** -- [have hindered their efforts. Currently,
the]{.underline} two [organization]{.underline}s **[lack official
channels for sharing classified information]{.underline}**.\[12\] [There
are several reasons for this rift, most notably a lack of
trust]{.underline} between NATO and the EU [via **different standards
and practices** in sharing and storing information]{.underline}.\[13\]
As will be discussed below, two essential differences are the handling
of private information and the use of cloud computing.

Private Information

[When it comes to handling private information, EU member states are
bound by]{.underline} the General Data Protection Regulation
([GDPR]{.underline}), which codifies that citizens have the right to
data protection and lays out rules governing how organizations can
collect and store personal information.\[14\] [However, NATO is not
bound by GDPR]{.underline} regulations. In particular, [NATO member
states who are not part of the EU have zero obligations to follow these
rules]{.underline}.\[15\] For example, the [GDPR strengthens protections
related to the "right to be forgotten," in which EU citizens can
demand]{.underline} that their [personal data be deleted. But, the
"right to be forgotten" does not exist in the US.]{.underline}\[16\]
[This circumstance creates concerns that NATO]{.underline} and its
non-EU member states [may not respect the privacy of EU
citizens]{.underline}.\[17\] For instance, in July 2020 the European
Court of Justice (CJEU) ruled that mass surveillance of digital data
carried out by the US National Security Agency (NSA) violates the
privacy right of EU citizens, as EU citizens have no recourse under US
law to challenge the collection of their data.\[18\] This ruling
invalidated the US-EU Privacy Shield, which was designed to allow
personal data to be transferred to the US, and was a key part of
transatlantic digital trade.\[19\]

Cloud Computing

[Meanwhile, both NATO and the EU are turning to cloud computing as a
platform to coordinate operations and store
information]{.underline}.\[20\] [However, their standards and practices
are dissimilar in scope and nature. NATO's cloud regulations are focused
on ensuring security and interoperability]{.underline} in a military
environment. [Moreover, NATO's guidelines for cloud computing include
its]{.underline} Federated Mission Networking ([FMN) standards, which
"establishes the framework for cooperation between command-and-control
networks for coalition forces]{.underline}."\[21\] And FMN standards for
cloud computing security mandate that all affiliates use a variety of
cryptographic algorithms, including the Advanced Encryption Standard, a
type of cipher that encrypts data in multiple rounds and is the standard
for the US government and military.\[22\] [By contrast, the EU's cloud
regulations are focused on ensuring cloud security for businesses and
consumers]{.underline}. The main regulation is the EU Code of Conduct
for Cloud Service Providers, [which does not provide specific security
measures that need to be taken]{.underline}, but instead mandates
companies' security be compliant with ISO 27001.\[23\] ISO 27001
establishes a process to create an information security management
system, including creating a risk assessment system producing
"consistent, valid and comparable results."\[24\] In regard to
government clouds, the EU does not have specific regulations, but does
offer a guide for best practices using the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA)
model. In the PDCA's four phases, governments first determine what they
need to cloudify and what risks there are; select necessary security
controls and implement them; review the measures after implementation to
see what problems have arisen; and finally act on those problems.\[25\]
[Without EU-wide regulations governing military cloud computing, it is
difficult for NATO to share information for fear of information ending
up on clouds not compliant with its own security standards.]{.underline}

**[Recommendations]{.underline}** for NATO and the EU

[Given the lack of trust between NATO and the EU, the first step to
improving information-sharing is]{.underline} to increase the two
organizations' faith in each other. As mentioned above, standards and
practices related to collecting and storing private data and the use of
cloud computing are two areas where NATO and the EU have serious
differences. Therefore, [creating shared standards and
practices]{.underline} for securing classified information is the best
way to bridge this transatlantic cyber rift.

Private Information

[To deal with issues surrounding private information, NATO and the EU
should work together to create a data protection framework for NATO that
meets minimum standards to protect data]{.underline}. The first step in
this direction is creating a permanent forum to deal with data
protection issues, such as the EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC).
In December 2020, the EU proposed the TTC to serve as a forum for the US
and EU to deal with issues related to emerging technology and trade
standards.\[26\] The TTC would bring together representatives from the
European Commission, members of US departments and agencies, and private
industry representatives.\[27\]

One of the TTC's first remits should be to revive the US-EU Privacy
Shield. This act will remove hurdles to US-EU trade, demonstrate that
both sides can and will work together, and allow them to coordinate
their response to the CJEU's decision in July 2020. Another important
step is creating redress for EU citizens whose data is collected by US
intelligence agencies. For example, making improvements to the Privacy
Shield Ombudsperson, a position created to handle complaints and provide
redress.\[28\] In fact, the CJEU declared that the Privacy Shield
Ombudsperson was ineffective because the position -- appointed by the US
President -- lacked independence.\[29\] In turn, the US could agree to
make the position independent by establishing a new position via
Congress.\[30\] After the US-EU Privacy Shield is renegotiated, the TTC
can act as a forum for future negotiations between the two sides, such
as handling the digital standards and data privacy portion of any future
trade negotiations. In addition, having the US and EU agree on standards
will encourage other NATO members, and perhaps non-EU member states, to
follow suit. Nevertheless, there are problems with the TTC. After all,
the TTC would be a forum to negotiate on a wide variety of issues
related to trade and technology, including digital taxation and
5G.\[31\] Thus, certain issues could derail the TTC's discussions on
digital privacy and data protection.

Cloud Computing

Meanwhile, the first step to developing shared standards and practices
for military cloud computing is to develop EU standards. A sound
starting point is by creating a new project to develop standards on how
EU member states' militaries use cloud computing through the Permanent
Structured Cooperation (PESCO), a program in which EU member states
collaborate on projects to improve security.\[32\] Given that NATO has
much more advanced military cloud computing capabilities than the EU,
NATO should assist in developing these standards and practices. For
example, the Defence and Related Security Capacity Building (DCB)
Initiative, which helps NATO partners, non-partners, and international
organizations improve their security and defense capabilities. In
theory, the EU would first request NATO's help with cloud computing.
Then, if approved via the North Atlantic Council, NATO would send funds,
advisors and technical experts.\[33\] Furthermore, the two largest
issues NATO should help the EU with are creating standards for security
and interoperability. For security, this means developing standards
around encryption, such as NATO recommending the EU use the Advanced
Encryption Standard that it uses. For interoperability, this means
ensuring all systems use a similar Application Program Interface (API),
or APIs, which defines a list of possible commands and the format to
issue those commands, thus allowing programs to interact with one
another.\[34\] EU member states must also use APIs compatible with one
another and with NATO member states.

The advantage of the aforementioned approach is that it allows the EU to
develop cloud computing capabilities compatible with NATO --
capabilities that both sides consider secure. By the same token, our
approach creates a framework that the two sides can use to work together
on other emerging technologies. Yet there are some problems with this
proposal. First, the US may not be willing to assist the EU, as some US
government officials have worried that EU military efforts will lead to
"duplication, non-interoperable military systems, diversion of scarce
defense resources, and unnecessary competition between NATO and the
EU."\[35\] The issue of duplication and non-interoperability would not
be an issue here. But, the other two problems may be enough to convince
US officials that cooperation is not in their best interest. The second
problem is that the EU may be reluctant to seek NATO's help, due to
fears that NATO could impede digital sovereignty. A third problem is
that US companies -- which, in 2019, controlled about 70% of the world
market -- are too dominant in the cloud computing sector, and this
dependence puts the autonomy of European data at risk.\[36\] Finally,
allowing NATO to help set standards and practices may be seen as
"Americanizing" European defense clouds while increasing dependence on
American firms. Despite these potential setbacks, NATO and the EU must
overcome mutual distrust and apprehension if they aim to conquer cyber
security concerns.

Creating a Platform

Once trust has been established, NATO and the EU should create official
channels to share classified information. First, these two organizations
must determine what information can be shared, who can receive the
information, and what sort of framework will exist for sharing this
information.\[37\] Sharing classified information requires NATO and the
EU to develop a shared classification scheme, ensuring individuals above
a certain security clearance can access information. Subsequently, the
two organizations would have to determine what types of devices can
access the platform. For example, allowing portable electronic devices
to access the platform fosters remote work, but also enables more
cyberattacks.\[38\] The second step is to create a security architecture
for this platform. One possible piece of security architecture comes
from the US Department of Defense's Comply to Connect Program (C2C). C2C
verifies that a device which attempts to connect to a network is
authorized to do so and is compliant with security policies.\[39\] This
verification process prevents unauthorized users or potentially
compromised endpoints from accessing classified information. C2C also
monitors all devices accessing the network, allowing the administrator
to know who is using the network without having to manually update a
list.\[40\] The main disadvantage of C2C is that it is currently being
used on a limited scale, and it is not entirely clear how it will work
across the entire Department of Defense, much less on a transnational
level.\[41\] But once a platform is up and running, it is necessary to
create mechanisms for getting user feedback, including surveys and
allowing users to submit error reports -- allowing NATO and the EU to
assess how well the platform is working and fix any problems that
emerge.\[42\]

Conclusion -- Bridging the Transatlantic Cyber Rift

NATO and the EU ought to create shared standards and practices for
sharing information, particularly in the areas of handling private
information and using cloud computing. To deal with the problem of
handling private information, the two organizations should create and
utilize a forum, such as the TTC. Moreover, the TTC could help
renegotiate the US-EU Privacy Shield Agreement. To deal with the problem
of cloud computing, the EU should create standards and practices related
to military cloud computing, best done by a project such as PESCO. NATO
could then assist the EU in developing these standards, using the DCB
Initiative as the framework for aid. Lastly, the two organizations
should create official channels to share classified information, making
sure to create a shared classification system while setting up a
security architecture to protect classified information. These
recommendations will dramatically improve the security of both NATO and
the EU, creating a groundwork for the two organizations to develop
better cooperation to deal with security threats inside -- and even
outside -- the cyber domain.

#### CBM (but is that IS with hostile actors?)

Sustainable, Stable, and Secure Cyberspace", edited by Scott J
Schakelford et al, published in 2022 by Cambridge Univ Press, Pages 54-

Building on this understanding of IS as a best practice, it is argued
here that [IS]{.underline} further [supports **sustainable cyber peace**
as a CBM at the international level, among]{.underline} the states,
[international organizations]{.underline}, and multinational companies
[that are critical to ensuring global cybersecurity. The framing of IS
as a CBM]{.underline}, rather than as a binding, substantive norm to
which these entities are subject as a matter of law or policy, [is
beneficial to the utilization of IS platforms at the international
level]{.underline} (Borghard & Lonergan, 2018). By sidestepping
substantive multilateral commitments, [IS can be more readily utilized
to support cybersecurity and cyber peace]{.underline}. Examples where
this has occurred include the UN's 2015 GGE (United Nations General
Assembly, 2015), the OSCE's 2016 listing of cybersecurity CBMs
(Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe, 2016), and the
2018 Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace (Principle 9).

[CBMs were]{.underline} originally [used in the context of the Cold War
to further disarmament processes in the context of the diplomatic and
political standoff]{.underline} between the USSR and the West.
[Nonmilitary CBMs have been defined more generally as "actions or
processes undertaken ... with the aim of increasing transparency and the
level of trust" between parties]{.underline} (Organization for Security
and Co-operation in Europe, 2013). [They are "one of the key measures in
the international community's toolbox aiming at preventing or reducing
the risk of a conflict by eliminating the causes of mistrust,
misunderstanding and miscalculation]{.underline}" (Pawlak, 2016, p.
133). [CBMs are]{.underline} also **[critical]{.underline}** [in the
global cybersecurity context and have been described as a "key tool in
the cyber peacebuilder's toolkit"]{.underline} (Nicholas, 2017).

In a 2017 in-depth study of eighty-four multilateral and bilateral
initiatives addressing the collective action challenges of
cybersecurity, including treaties, codes of conduct, agreements,
memoranda and public declarations, IS was found to be included as an
agreed cybersecurity measure in more than 25 percent of such initiatives
(twenty-one out of the total eighty-four) (Housen-Couriel, 2017, pp.
51--52). Moreover, the analysis was able to isolate several specific
elements of IS, discussed above, that were individually included in this
top quarter: IS measures in general15; establishment of a specific
national or organizational point of contact for information exchange;
and sharing of threat indicators (Housen-Couriel, 2017, pp. 51--52).16
These elements were three out of a list of a dozen CBMs that occur with
sufficient frequency to be included in a "convergence of concept" with
which diverse stakeholders -- states, regional organizations,
intergovernmental organizations, specialized UN agencies, standards
organizations, private corporations, sectoral organizations, and NGOs --
have incorporated into cybersecurity initiatives.17 The study concluded
that, while such cyberspace stakeholders are frequently willing to
incorporate general arrangements for IS (it is in fact the leading
agreed-upon cyber CBM in the initiatives that were studied), and even to
specify a national or organizational point of contact, they are less
willing to commit to a 24/7, real-time exchange of cybersecurity related
information (Housen-Couriel, 2017, p. 67). This finding indicates a gap
that should be considered in the context of further leveraging IS in the
context of cyber peace.

Nonetheless, as noted above, IS as a CBM holds the advantage of
bypassing the present, considerable challenges of achieving formal and
substantive multistakeholder agreement on substantive cyber norms, until
such time as such binding norms are legally and geopolitically
practicable (Efroni & Shany, 2018; Finnemore & Hollis, 2016; Macak,
2017). A few examples of binding domestic law and international
regulatory requirements for organizational participation in IS platforms
do exist, such as the pan-EU regime established under the EU NIS
(Directive 2016/1148), the Estonian Cybersecurity Act of 2016, and the
US Department of Defense disclosure obligations for contractors when
their networks have been breached. However, there are many more based on
voluntary participation, such as the CISCP and FS-ISAC reviewed above,
Israel's FC3, and the global CERT and CSIRT networks of 24/7 platforms
for cyber threat monitoring, including the EU network of more than 414
such platforms (European Union Network and Information Security Agency,
2018).

For the purposes of its analysis in this chapter, IS constitutes as a
nonbinding CBM that also constitutes a best practice for bolstering
cybersecurity and cyber peace, yet does not require a binding legal
basis for its implementation. The critical issue of the use of
regulatory measures, both binding and voluntary, to promote IS for
optimal cybersecurity and cyber peace is, as noted above, an issue for
further research.

Despite this, examples of solidarity remain the exception, as challenges
persist between NATO nations to integrate capabilities. First, there is
no alliance-wide synergy of response tools enabling NATO nations. The
2015 Strategy on NATO's Role in Countering Hybrid Warfare deferred on
this, conceding the primacy of individual nations over collective action
in countering hybrid acts.\[18\] Thus, several controlled technical
resources are restricted to national use and remain unavailable to NATO
formations.\[19\] Intelligence collection also remains varied between
states. Intelligence sharing, a major tool in attributing hybrid
threats, also remains limited. For example, there is not an
Alliance-wide technical architecture for sharing near-real-time
intelligence, especially between the NATO command structure and its
subordinate formations. Protocols defining appropriate response options
are limited and delineated command authority in multi-domain operations
clarifying suitable, or legally appropriate responses to threshold
activities are non-existent. This is especially challenging when
Russia's gray-zone behavior bypasses the norms of democracy and the rule
of law abided by the US and NATO.
