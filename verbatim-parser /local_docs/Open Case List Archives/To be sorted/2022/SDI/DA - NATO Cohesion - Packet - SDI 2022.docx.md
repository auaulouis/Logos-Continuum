[**[Unity on Ukraine]{.underline}**]{.mark} war **[[deters
China]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Undoubtedly, Russian President Vladimir **[Putin's invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}** has **[provided]{.underline}** Chinese President
**[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping (習近平) with **[the biggest
opportunity]{.underline}** in disguise **[to scrutinize the reaction of
the international community. [For Xi, it comes]{.mark} at the right time
and]{.underline}**, to some extent, **[[as the only point of
reference]{.mark} for his own]{.underline}** permutation and
combinations of **["unification" tactics toward Taiwan.]{.underline}**

**[The Russia-Ukraine crisis has put forward the best worst-case
scenario for Xi for assessing]{.underline}** miscalculations, and **[the
kind of responses and countermeasures that one can expect from the
international system.]{.underline}**

Unlike for any other leader, **[the [lessons]{.mark} Xi can draw
[from]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark} crisis are significant because they
[can be linked to]{.mark}]{.underline}** any form of
**[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** future **[[adventurism in
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The US Department of Defense in 2020 notably said that the Chinese
military is "likely preparing for a contingency to unify Taiwan with the
mainland by force."

China's increasing aggressive posture has only added to speculation over
China's plans to invade Taiwan.

In January, Chinese Ambassador to the US Qin Gang (秦剛) issued a stern
warning, saying that the US could face "military conflict" with China
over the status of Taiwan.

If this is the case, then the **[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** crisis
aptly **[[serves as a litmus test for Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Putin's assault on Ukraine is vital for Xi's calculations in two ways:

First, there are diverging perceptions of Ukraine's sovereignty in Kyiv
and Moscow. Ukraine considers itself a sovereign nation, while Putin is
inclined to adopt a "Soviet Union mentality."

On similar terms, Xi's actions dovetail China's "Middle Kingdom
mentality" under the "Chinese dream" of "rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation" through "reunification with Taiwan."

The logic is that of an "unfinished business" of getting foreign
territories "back" into one's geopolitical orbit --- Ukraine for Putin
and Taiwan for Xi.

Second, and most importantly, there is the leadership factor, wherein
Putin's Russia appears synonymous with Xi's China --- with the countries
respective leaders being the chieftain of all things under their
autocratic political apparatus.

**[[While similarity]{.mark} between Taiwan and Ukraine [cannot be drawn
in a linear fashion, strong deductions can be made]{.mark} with regard
to China's behavior toward Taiwan]{.underline}** and the Russia-Ukraine
crisis.

That is, **[[for]{.mark} China, and [Xi]{.mark} in
particular]{.underline}**, the **[[big lessons will be drawn from a
careful reading of the international community's reaction]{.mark}
toward]{.underline}** what **[Putin]{.underline}** calls Russia's
"special military operation" aiming to "demilitarize and de-Nazify
Ukraine" under the logic that "Russia cannot feel safe, develop and
exist with a constant threat emanating from the territory of modern
Ukraine." **[The outcome has so far been]{.underline}** international
condemnation and boycotts of Russia, and the imposition of economic
sanctions by the US and the EU --- resulting in **[Russia becoming a
"pariah" state.]{.underline}**

In contrast to full economic embargoes on countries such as North Korea,
Iran, Cuba and Syria, the US has adopted a selective approach on Russia,
imposing measures in a phase-by-phase manner. The US Office of Foreign
Assets Control has imposed financial sanctions and restrictions on a
majority of Russian oligarchs and state-owned banking and financial
service providers, and added various Russian banks, as well as Putin and
many of his associates, to the asset control office's Specially
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.

The US Department of Commerce has targeted Russia's oil refining sector
with stringent export controls and identified 91 entities that support
Russian military activities --- a measure to cut off Moscow's access to
US goods it needs to sustain its military aggression against Ukraine.

Furthermore, the US has imposed an import ban on Russian alcoholic
beverages, seafood and nonindustrial diamonds.

To deter Russia, the US has also imposed sweeping export controls on
Belarus, which supports Russia, as a preventive measure to ensure that
technology, software and other goods used in the defense, aerospace and
maritime sectors are not passed on from Minsk to Moscow.

The EU's sanctions on Russia include financial restrictions, an assets
freeze, bans on Russian planes flying in EU airspace and landing at EU
airports, a ban on transactions with the Russian central bank, a ban on
seven Russian lenders from the SWIFT bank-to-bank messaging system, and
suspensions of Russian state-media Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as
individual sanctions against Putin and his associates. The bloc also
imposed individual and economic sanctions on Belarus.

Joining the US and EU, Japan imposed sanctions on Russian and Belarusian
officials and oligarchs, as well as on Russian organizations and
companies, and it is discussing a ban on exports of oil refining
equipment to Russia and dual-use products to Belarus.

However, unlike the US, Japan remains reluctant to close its airspace to
Russian planes.

On March 11, the US along with its NATO allies, the G7 and the EU,
revoked Russia's "most-favored nation" status --- one of the hardest
blows to the already downgraded Russian economy.

Germany halted the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to
condemn Russia's actions against Ukraine.

These international sanctions and measures are aimed at weakening
Russia's will to fight and putting Moscow in a difficult position by
isolating it.

With the value of the ruble plummeting, the international community's
economic boycott of Moscow holds significant repercussions for domestic
instability in Russia, which will be fostered by the growing financial
crisis and Moscow's isolation from the international system.

However, the sanctions have so far failed to deter Russia's military
actions; they have only emboldened Putin's aggressive posture on
Ukraine.

It is noteworthy though that **[[the global backlash]{.mark} against
Russia [carries a strong message for China]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

That is, **[if China plans to take Taiwan by force, it will have to be
ready for]{.underline}** the **[punitive measures. Can China afford
isolation]{.underline}**, especially when China wants to take the
"center stage," as outlined by Xi at the 19th National Congress of the
Chinese Communist Party in 2017?

**[That question acts as a red flag for Beijing.]{.underline}**

In the context of the Russia-Ukraine crisis, it is also noteworthy that
while major powers are not reluctant to impose sanctions and build up
their defenses, they are hesitant to otherwise confront Russia, or even
to engage NATO to do so.

While the US and its allies have called Putin the "aggressor," no one
seeks to confront Russia directly, as evidenced by US President Joe
Biden saying: "Our forces are not engaged and will not engage in the
conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine. Our forces are not going to
Europe to fight \[in\] Ukraine, but to defend our NATO allies in the
event that Putin decides to keep moving west."

This brings in a potential miscalculation for China.

Can the US' reluctant posture to fight Russia over Ukraine be applied in
the case of a Chinese adventure in Taiwan?

The answer lies in the US' policy of "strategic ambiguity" over Taiwan,
meaning that Washington is deliberately vague about what it would do if
China were to attack the nation.

However, this vagueness leaves room for the US to come to Taiwan's
defense.

Giving some clarity, Biden in October last year answered the question
whether "the US would come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack
by China" by saying bluntly: "Yes, we have a commitment to do that."

Taiwan holds severe reputational costs for the US; it cannot afford to
act reluctantly against any Chinese action, but would have to retaliate.

**[Hence, [taking]{.mark}]{.underline}** copious
**[[note]{.underline}]{.mark}**s **[[of]{.mark} the
Russia-[Ukraine]{.mark} crisis, China under [Xi will be cautious and
calibrated]{.mark} in its behavior [toward
Taiwan]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[It disturbs China's]{.underline}]{.mark}** larger geopolitical
**[[plans that there is a]{.mark} growing [united front]{.mark} between
the US and Europe --- with the crisis in Ukraine bridging the
gap.]{.underline}**

**[If this united front strengthens]{.underline}**, it will not only be
a debacle for China's global ambitions; **[it will]{.underline}** also
**[have ramifications for China's plans for Taiwan.]{.underline}**

Besides, Taiwan will be a much harder bargain for China. **[At this
juncture, Beijing]{.underline}** --- given its leanings toward Moscow
--- **[cannot afford to be caught in the crosshairs of the US and
Europe.]{.underline}**

#### NATO [inherently resists tech changes]{.underline}- pursuing consensus consumes [significant time and resources]{.underline} even if it fails

**[[Resistance to Innovation in NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Military leaders need to understand the symbiotic relationship between
risk-taking and innovative progress. It may be commonly assumed that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)---one of the most durable and
best-funded multinational defense organizations in history---has
sufficient communication systems in order to operate effectively as an
alliance of many disparate forces. One might then also assume that
NATO-member special operations forces---the elite units of the
alliance---have the best and most effective communication systems to
coordinate and react to crises rapidly. However, this is not the case.
If a crisis were to occur today, communication across the partner forces
would be difficult. **[[Tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nological
**[[solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** to these problems do exist and
could be implemented with relative ease. Why
**[[are]{.underline}]{.mark}** they **[[unlikely to be
adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}**? The authors argue that **[[institutional
resistance to innovation at NATO is driven by the inherent
characteristics of]{.mark} managing and maintaining [a large,
heterogeneous alliance]{.mark} among sovereign entities]{.underline}**.
This resistance can only be overcome if decisive, flexible, and adaptive
military leaders are bold enough to allow an organization to accommodate
new, sophisticated technologies. Otherwise innovation in the military
grinds to a halt. Solving problems like this will not be easy, but it is
necessary for NATO to adapt to the rapidly changing strategic
environment and technological landscape in which it finds itself.

Innovative technologies that can effectively connect multiple NATO
special operations forces, such as multilateral online and offline
mapping, military radio controlling, text messaging, targeting, calling
for fire, etc. already exist. Currently, the Tactical Assault Kit
application for Android and Windows allows for all of these
capabilities. The Tactical Assault Kit platform permits for a wide range
of methods for establishing connectivity, even blending military
satellite communication and commercial equipment. The Tactical Assault
Kit communication system has been field tested by U.S., Norwegian, and
Danish special operations forces in support of operations against ISIS.
NATO special operations forces partners were initially restricted from
accompanying Iraqi or Syrian partner forces on the battlefield, but they
were allowed to support them with close air support. The communication
chain, however, was too slow and led to some delayed direct support for
the counter-ISIS forces on the battlefield. All this changed when a
couple of bright minds saw the potential in Tactical Assault Kit and
managed to put together tactical field kits, using the existing mapping
tool as the technical medium to speed up coordination and target
acquisition between counter-ISIS forces and NATO special operations
forces elements. It thus became a success story, and the system is being
actively used in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.

For a comprehensive employment of Tactical Assault Kit within NATO
special operations forces, every allied country will have to change the
way they look at military communication. In order to best explain the
concept of scalable connectivity in this context, one needs to consider
how military missions are planned. The military mission consists of
three fundamental parts: shoot, move, and communicate. Ahead of a
mission, how to shoot and move are thoroughly analyzed in order to
utilize the best tools in the toolbox. For instance, if a unit is
planning an urban special reconnaissance mission, there are several
tools to choose from. A civilian car can be chosen over a tactical
vehicle to maintain a low profile when inserting the special
reconnaissance team into the target area. To maximize the freedom of
movement without being compromised, the team might select civilian
clothes and easily concealed weapons. Using this approach, the
likelihood of being detected is minimized, whereas the chance of success
is maximized. In short, it comes down to the calculation of risk versus
gain. Communications deserve as much attention and investment as the
weapon components for the mission to be effective, but this is not
currently the case.

Only a few tools are available as communication options, which restrict
military elements to primarily utilize encrypted push-to-talk radios.
The typical military communication plan, the so-called PACE (primary,
alternate, contingency, emergency) plan, is mainly composed of different
frequencies, predetermined satellite or VHF/HF communication channels,
and regular cellphone use as emergency backup. However, current and near
future peer adversaries all have electronic warfare capabilities. This
means that the choice of NATO communication equipment and its
integration into the planning phase of battle determines mission success
or failure. Scalable connectivity can be an effective tool when the area
of operations' frequency spectrum is analyzed and appropriate
communication tools are utilized. Despite the aforementioned benefits,
NATO has been slow, if not resistant, to leveraging communication
solutions that can connect its respective special operations forces.
Furthermore, NATO members are prone to purchase equipment from large
military communication corporations. This industrial base supply chain
problem stems from corporations that offer rigid, comprehensive
solutions that offer little to no flexibility by having proprietary
software and hardware. It also leads to transmitting a large military
fingerprint easily detectable by adversaries. To move past the problem
of inflexible military communication equipment, NATO needs to rethink
the concepts of what is secure and classified and how this will impact
the risk to a mission and force.

**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** special operations forces **[[have been
slow to adopt innovative solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** such as
Tactical Assault Kit, **[[despite]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
**[[attractive]{.mark} and innovative [features]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
What explains this resistance? Resistance to innovation is at once
puzzling, intellectually intriguing, and a commercially interesting
phenomenon. In the 1940s, the German psychologist Kurt Lewin was the
first to introduce a systemic understanding of the resistance
phenomenon. **[The cause]{.underline}**, according to Lewin,
**[is]{.underline}** not found in the mind of the individual employee,
but **[in the dynamics of opposing forces, including the behavior of
leadership.]{.underline}** According to the political economist Josef
Schumpeter, "Innovation is the creation of new combinations that
represent a departure from established practices." In other words, a
technological **[tension between the need to innovate and the desire to
maintain order and stability will always exist]{.underline}**. Wendell
Wallach nicely defines the problem as "the pacing gap" between the
introduction of a new technology and the establishment of laws,
regulations, and oversight mechanisms for shaping its safe development.
Wallach believes that **[modern tech]{.underline}**nological
**[innovation is occurring at an unprecedented pace, making it harder
than ever to govern using traditional legal and regulatory
mechanisms.]{.underline}**

**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a whole **[[suffers severely from the
pacing gap, due to the fact that it consists of 29-]{.mark}member
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If a new communication technology is
proven highly successful by one country, **[[the product]{.mark} still
[has to be vetted by each country]{.mark}'s security and intelligence
services. A process like [this takes time and consumes
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}**, forcing poorer nations to evaluate the
importance of a new technology versus the old. **[This process
exacerbates the pacing gap within NATO as [standardization becomes a
protracted process]{.mark} of having to generate consensus among the
member states.]{.underline}**

#### That emerging tech debate [destroys NATO unity]{.underline}

Converging technologies also pose fundamental human security challenges.
As Francis Fukuyama once argued in Our Posthuman Future: Consequences of
the Biotechnology Revolution, converging technologies could inequitably
transform the world we live in and, in the process, undermine the very
foundations that underpin liberal democracies. Whether or not such a
future unfolds, it is clear that **[[their application raises
serious]{.mark} ethical and moral [issues]{.mark} that are [proving
divisive for allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** and enemies alike (eg: the
debates over armed drones and cyber espionage). **[[Even where common
approaches can be achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}** (eg: combatting
designer drugs), converging technologies are growing "faster than our
ability to legislate or regulate" them.

**[[These developments are putting new stresses
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** alliance.
According to a recent experts workshop, **[the]{.underline}** NBRIC
**[Revolution is [threatening NATO unity]{.mark}. "As warfare is
outsourced to only those who are 'near peers' in
tech]{.underline}**nology and societal views shift," **[[NATO
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** likely **[[experience "decreasing political
tolerance for alliance security efforts".]{.underline}]{.mark}** If NATO
member states want to sustain "the traditional transatlantic compact
\[European political support in return for US military guarantees\]",
they must change the way NATO approaches cooperative security around
emerging technologies. And, they need to do it now.

[A [Fight Over Taiwan Could Go **Nuclear**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[**War-Gaming** Reveals]{.underline}]{.mark} How [a [U.S.-Chinese
Conflict Might **Escalate**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has raised the specter of nuclear war, as
Russian President Vladimir Putin has placed his nuclear forces at an
elevated state of alert and has warned that any effort by outside
parties to interfere in the war would result in "consequences you have
never seen." Such saber-rattling has understandably made headlines and
drawn notice in Washington. But [if China attempted to]{.underline}
forcibly [invade Taiwan]{.underline} and the United States came to
Taipei's aid, the threat of [escalation could outstrip]{.underline} even
[the]{.underline} current nerve-[wracking situation in
Europe]{.underline}.

[A recent war game]{.underline}, conducted by the Center for a New
American Security in conjunction with the NBC program "Meet the Press,"
[demonstrated just how quickly such a conflict could
escalate]{.underline}. The game posited a fictional crisis set in 2027,
with the aim of examining how the United States and China might act
under a certain set of conditions. [The game demonstrated]{.underline}
that [[China's military modernization and expansion of its nuclear
arsenal---not to mention the importance Beijing places
on]{.underline}]{.mark} unification with
[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that, [in
the real world, [a fight]{.mark} between China and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[could **very well go
nuclear**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Beijing views Taiwan as a breakaway republic. [If the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty
[decides to invade]{.underline} the island, [its leaders may not be able
to accept failure without seriously harming the regime's legitimacy.
Thus, the CCP might be willing to take significant risks]{.underline} to
ensure that the conflict ends on terms that it finds acceptable. That
would mean convincing the United States and its allies that the costs of
defending Taiwan are so high that it is not worth contesting the
invasion. While China has several ways to achieve that goal, from
Beijing's perspective, using nuclear weapons may be the most effective
means to keep the United States out of the conflict.

GEARING FOR BATTLE

China is several decades into transforming its People's Liberation Army
(PLA) into what the Chinese President Xi Jinping has called a
"world-class military" that could defeat any third party that comes to
Taiwan's defense. China's warfighting strategy, known as
"anti-access/area denial," rests on being able to project conventional
military power out several thousand miles in order to prevent the
American military, in particular, from effectively countering a Chinese
attack on Taiwan. Meanwhile, [a growing nuclear arsenal]{.underline}
provides Beijing with coercive leverage as well as potentially new
warfighting capabilities, which [could increase the risks of war and
escalation]{.underline}.

China has historically possessed only a few hundred ground-based nuclear
weapons. But last year, nuclear scholars at the James Martin Center for
Nonproliferation Studies and the Federation of American Scientists
identified three missile silo fields under construction in the Xinjiang
region. The Financial Times reported that China might have carried out
tests of hypersonic gliders as a part of an orbital bombardment system
that could evade missile defenses and deliver nuclear weapons to targets
in the continental United States. The U.S. Department of Defense
projects that by 2030, China will have around 1,000 deliverable
warheads---more than triple the number it currently possesses. Based on
these projections, Chinese leaders may believe that as early as five
years from now the PLA will have made enough conventional and nuclear
gains that it could fight and win a war to unify with Taiwan.

[Our recent war game]{.underline}---in which members of Congress, former
government officials, and subject matter experts assumed the roles of
senior national security decision makers in China and the United
States---[illustrated]{.underline} that [a [U.S.-Chinese war could
**escalate quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For one thing, it showed that
[[both]{.mark} countries [would face **operational incentives** to
strike]{.mark} military forces on [the other's
territory]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the game, [[such strikes]{.mark} were
intended to be calibrated]{.underline} to avoid escalation; both sides
tried to walk a fine line by attacking only military targets.
[But]{.underline} such attacks [[cross]{.underline}]{.mark}ed **[[red
lines]{.underline}]{.mark}** for both countries, [[and
produce]{.underline}]{.mark}d [a **[tit-for-tat]{.mark}** cycle of
[attacks]{.mark} that broadened the scope and intensity of the
conflict.]{.underline}

For instance, in the simulation, [China]{.underline} launched a
preemptive attack against key U.S. bases in the Indo-Pacific region. The
attacks [targeted Guam]{.underline}, in particular,
[because]{.underline} it is a forward operating base critical to U.S.
military operations in Asia, and because since [it is a
territory]{.underline}, and not a U.S. state, [the Chinese team
viewed]{.underline} striking [it as less escalatory]{.underline} than
attacking other possible targets. In response, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [targeted Chinese military ships in
ports]{.underline} and surrounding facilities, but refrained from other
attacks on the Chinese mainland. [Nevertheless, both sides perceived
these strikes as attacks on their home territory, crossing an important
threshold]{.underline}. Instead of mirror-imaging their own concerns
about attacks on their territory, each side justified the initial blows
as military necessities that were limited in nature and would be seen by
the other as such. Responses to the initial strikes only escalated
things further as the U.S. team responded to China's moves by hitting
targets in mainland China, and the Chinese team responded to
Washington's strikes by attacking sites in Hawaii.

A NEW ERA

One particularly alarming finding from the war game is that China found
it necessary to threaten to go nuclear from the start in order to ward
off outside support for Taiwan. This threat was repeated throughout the
game, particularly after mainland China had been attacked. At times,
efforts to erode Washington's will so that it would back down from the
fight received greater attention by the China team than the invasion of
Taiwan itself. But [[China had difficulty convincing the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates that [[its
nuclear threats were credible]{.underline}]{.mark}. In real life,
China's significant and recent changes to its nuclear posture and
readiness may impact other nations' views, as its nuclear threats may
not be viewed as credible [given [its ]{.mark}]{.underline}stated
doctrine of [[n]{.underline}]{.mark}o [[f]{.underline}]{.mark}irst
[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}se, its smaller but burgeoning nuclear arsenal,
and lack of experience making nuclear threats. [This [may push China
to]{.mark} **[preemptively detonate a nuc]{.mark}**]{.underline}lear
weapon [[to reinforce]{.mark} the [credibility]{.mark} of its
warning.]{.underline}

[China might also resort to a]{.underline} demonstration of its
[nuc]{.underline}lear might [because of constraints on its long-range
conventional strike capabilities]{.underline}. Five years from now, the
PLA still will have a very limited ability to launch conventional
attacks beyond locations in the "second island chain" in the Pacific;
namely, Guam and Palau. Unable to strike the U.S. homeland with
conventional weapons, China would struggle to impose costs on the
American people. Up until a certain point in the game, the U.S. team
felt its larger nuclear arsenal was sufficient to deter escalation and
did not fully appreciate the seriousness of China's threats. As a
result, China felt it needed to escalate significantly to send a message
that the U.S. homeland could be at risk if Washington did not back down.
Despite China's stated "no-first use" nuclear policy, the war game
resulted in Beijing detonating a nuclear weapon off the coast of Hawaii
as a demonstration. The attack caused relatively little destruction, as
the electromagnetic pulse only damaged the electronics of ships in the
immediate vicinity but did not directly impact the U.S. state. The war
game ended before the U.S. team could respond, but it is likely that the
[first use]{.underline} of a nuclear weapon since World War II
[would]{.underline} have [provoke]{.underline}d [a
response]{.underline}.

The most likely paths to nuclear escalation in a fight between the
United States and China are different from those that were most likely
during the Cold War. The Soviet Union and the United States feared a
massive, bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack, which would precipitate a
full-scale strategic exchange. In a confrontation over Taiwan, however,
Beijing could employ nuclear weapons in a more limited way to signal
resolve or to improve its chances of winning on the battlefield. It is
unclear how a war would proceed after that kind of limited nuclear use
and whether the United States could de-escalate the situation while
still achieving its objectives.

**[For NATO, Turkey Is a Disruptive Ally]{.underline}**

When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatened this month to
block NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, Western officials were
exasperated --- but not shocked.

**[[Within an alliance that operates by consensus, the Turkish strongman
has come to be]{.mark}]{.underline}** seen as something of **[[a stickup
artist]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 2009, **[[he blocked]{.mark} the
appointment of [a new NATO chief]{.mark} from Denmark]{.underline}**,
complaining that the country was too tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet
Muhammad and too sympathetic to "Kurdish terrorists" based in Turkey. It
took hours of cajoling by Western leaders, and a face-to-face promise
from President Barack Obama that NATO would appoint a Turk to a
leadership position, to satisfy Mr. Erdogan.

to fortify Eastern Europea]{.mark}n countries against
Russia]{.underline}**, again citing Kurdish militants and demanding that
the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be terrorists. In 2020,
Mr. Erdogan sent a gas-exploration ship backed by fighter jets close to
Greek waters, causing France to send ships in support of Greece, also a
NATO member.

**[Now the [Turkish leader is back in the role of
obstructionist]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and is once again invoking the
Kurds, **[as he charges that Sweden and Finland sympathize with the
Kurdish militants he has made his main enemy.]{.underline}**

"These countries have almost become guesthouses for terrorist
organizations," he said this month. "It is not possible for us to be in
favor."

Mr. **[Erdogan's stance is a reminder of [a long-festering problem for
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which currently has 30 members. **[Russia's
invasion of Ukraine may have given the alliance a new sense of mission,
but [NATO must]{.mark} still [contend with an authoritarian leader
willing to use his leverage to gain political points at home by blocking
consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}** --- at least for a time.

**[It]{.underline}** i**[s a situation that plays to the advantage
of]{.underline}** President Vladimir V. **[Putin]{.underline}** of
Russia, **[who has grown friendlier with]{.underline}** Mr.
**[Erdogan]{.underline}** in recent years. **[For the Russian leader,
the rejection of Swedish and Finnish admission into NATO would be a
significant victory.]{.underline}**

**[The quandary would be simpler were it not for Turkey's importance to
the alliance.]{.underline}** The country joined NATO in 1952 after
aligning with the West against the Soviet Union; **[Turkey gives the
alliance a crucial strategic position]{.underline}** at the intersection
of Europe and Asia, astride both the Middle East and the Black Sea. It
hosts a major U.S. air base where American nuclear weapons are stored,
and Mr. Erdogan has blocked Russian warships headed toward Ukraine.

**[But]{.underline}** under Mr. Erdogan, **[Turkey has increasingly
become a problem to be managed]{.underline}**. As prime minister and
then as president, he has tilted his country away from Europe while
practicing an authoritarian and populist brand of Islamist politics,
especially since a failed coup attempt in 2016.

He has purchased an advanced missile system from Russia that NATO
officials call a threat to their integrated defense systems, and in 2019
he mounted a military incursion to battle Kurds in northern Syria who
were aiding the fight against the Islamic State with U.S. support.

## UNIQUENESS

Republican U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin is the top House
Republican on foreign affairs and voted to support NATO. On Wednesday,

He told The Texas Tribune that **[[NATO countries are "stepping up" in

Germany now is putting in 2% of their GDP. And they are sending weapons
and they are training," he said.

NATO bonds further frayed in recent years, as Trump regularly railed
against the alliance. But his criticism did lead to several NATO
countries deciding to increase their defense spending.

When President Joe Biden landed in Europe this week, it was a different
continent than he had last visited in the fall of 2021.

After a month of intensive fighting in Ukraine, Russia has killed at
least 1,000 civilians while an unknown number (but reportedly thousands)
of Russian soldiers have died. **[[By invading
Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Russian President Vladimir
[**[Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark} has
[**[catalyzed]{.underline}**]{.mark} some **[[major
shifts]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Germany, long averse to military
spending, has decided to up its defense budget. European countries,
skeptical of migrants, have welcomed Ukrainian refugees. And most of
all, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([**[NATO) has been
revived]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Long a lethargic dinosaur of an organization, NATO this week announced
new battle groups would deploy to four countries on its eastern flank,
and Biden announced that the alliance would respond to Russia should it
use chemical weapons in Ukraine. **[It's a remarkable
shift]{.underline}** for an alliance that French President Emmanuel
Macron called brain dead just two and a half years ago. And it reveals a
fundamental truth of the organization: It's an alliance meant to counter
a great power adversary, for good and bad.

Biden, who has long cheered the relationship between the United States
and Europe, met 29 other heads of state and the secretary general of
NATO for a closed-door meeting Thursday, which Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy joined by video. "Today's **[establishment of four
new battle groups]{.underline}** in Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, and
Hungary **[is a strong signal]{.underline}** that **[we
will]{.underline}** collectively defend and **[protect every inch of
NATO territory]{.underline}**," Biden said.

NATO summits, it might be said, are not usually very substantive. The
family photo of recognizable world leaders is often the most memorable
moment from these largely symbolic affairs. But **[NATO]{.underline}**,
an alliance forged to push back against Soviet influence in Europe
during the Cold War, **[is designed for crisis]{.underline}**.

**[Plenty of new things]{.underline}**, in addition to the troop
deployment, **[came out of Thursday's meetings]{.underline}** and in
advance of them. Biden announced **[\$1 billion in new humanitarian
aid]{.underline}** to those affected by the new refugee crisis in
Europe, and a week earlier, the US had announced **[\$1 billion more
in]{.underline}** military and **[security aid]{.underline}** to
Ukraine. Together with European countries, the White House and State
Department announced **[even more sanctions]{.underline}** on Russian
politicians, military leaders, and elites, and measures to stop
sanctions-evaders. Biden also said he would support throwing Russia out
of the G20 club of countries with major economies.

The trip isn't just about NATO. Biden is meeting with leaders of the
European Union and the G7 countries. He will also travel to Poland,
which, bordering Ukraine, has received more than 2 million Ukrainian
refugees as of this week. And Biden announced that the US will welcome
100,000 refugees from the ongoing war.

"[**[NATO was]{.underline}**]{.mark} first sort of **[[given]{.mark} a
new mission]{.underline}**, or **[[a new lease on
life]{.underline}]{.mark}**, by the events of 2014," the last time Putin
invaded Ukraine, said Samuel Charap, a Russia expert at the RAND
Corporation. "**[[There's a unity of purpose now that there wasn't
before]{.mark}."]{.underline}**

How NATO is meeting the moment

The alliance of 30 countries in Europe and North America had been
intended to contain the Soviet Union's advances in the world. Yet as
recently as three years ago, critics --- including some world leaders
--- wondered if it wasn't well suited for the geopolitics of the 21st
century.

Some preeminent US foreign policy leaders argued in the 1990s that NATO
wasn't the right way for the US to engage Europe after the fall of the
Soviet Union, but then as now, NATO skeptics didn't have much sway in
Washington.

Enter US President Donald Trump. Preaching a so-called America-first
foreign policy, Trump often bashed NATO; he wanted allies to spend more
on their militaries, and reportedly for the US to withdraw from the
alliance. That stance rankled members of the Washington security
establishment, but he wasn't the only one who emphasized the alliance's
shortcomings. "What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of
NATO," Macron said in 2019.

The comment came after Trump pulled US troops out of Syria to avoid
clashing with NATO ally Turkey. He withdrew those forces, however,
without consulting with other NATO allies, calling into question the
dependability of the Trump White House --- and by extension, of the
United States. US power is one of the biggest guarantors of the
alliance, and Trump had battered that image.

"You have partners together in the same part of the world, and you have
no coordination whatsoever of strategic decision-making between the
United States and its NATO allies. None," added Macron. He later stood
by that harsh assessment.

Those criticisms, and other concerns throughout the late 2010s, led even
former diplomats and scholars who were staunch supporters of the
transatlantic alliance to say that NATO was in crisis.

Derek Chollet and Amanda Sloat, two policy experts who are now senior
Biden administration officials, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine in 2018
that NATO summits were "just not worth it" and simply too risky when
Trump was in office, as he denigrated the alliance on the world stage.

Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor who is now serving as Biden's
ambassador to China, co-wrote a paper three years ago that argued that
Trump's NATO bashing, increasingly undemocratic leaders under the NATO
umbrella (among them Turkey and Hungary), and NATO's failure to confront
Putin "have hurtled the Alliance into its most worrisome crisis in
memory."

Now **[NATO is a key pillar of the]{.underline}** Biden administration's
**[response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}**.
"[**[Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark} has **[[reinvigorated NATO in a
fundamental way]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Ivo Daalder, who served as
Obama's ambassador to NATO and now directs the Chicago Council on Global
Affairs. "What Biden has done is he has reminded Americans and our
allies how important NATO is."

To deter Russia, **[NATO]{.underline}** has **[doubled the active forces
under its direct command in eastern Europe]{.underline}**; there are now
about 40,000 on the continent, in addition to the 100,000 US troops
stationed there. A NATO spokesperson tweeted a graphic showing that 130
aircraft and 140 naval vessels are "on high alert."

As NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said at the top of the
summit, "**[NATO is providing unprecedented support to
Ukraine]{.underline}**, helping them to defend themselves." He mentioned
the "**[unprecedented sanctions" on Russia]{.underline}**
**[and]{.underline}** NATO's **[increased military
presence]{.underline}**, especially in Romania.

NATO is stepping up to be the leader of European security. Should it?

Proponents --- and there are many --- of the Biden team's response and
NATO's resurgence say this is exactly what the alliance should be doing.

NATO was the United States' first transcontinental peacetime alliance,
and maintaining it in peacetime is important, says John Manza, a former
senior NATO official who is now a professor at the National Defense
University. "It's like a fire truck that's sitting in the local fire
station. You can complain and say, 'Oh, it's not doing anything, it's
just costing us money' --- until there's a fire and you need it," he
told me.

NATO is learning from its last major test, in 2014, when Putin annexed
Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and later invaded the country's eastern
provinces. In response, NATO expanded its cohort of rapid response
troops.

The alliance in 2018 developed a readiness plan with major land, sea,
and air capabilities able to mobilize in 30 days. This month, NATO
announced that it is significantly growing its forward presence to plan
for potential contingencies. "Now we have enough combat power to really
defend conventionally alliance territory against a near-peer competitor,
like Russia," Manza said.

The alliance, at its core, is about preventing interstate war on the
European continent. "It's absolutely what you could call NATO's sweet
spot," said Bruce Jentleson, a Duke political scientist and fellow at
the Wilson Center in Washington. "When you have sort of a superseding
shared security threat, that's when countries work together."

That's not to say NATO has it all figured out. "The real conundrum for
NATO is the nuclear, biological, and chemical one," said Evelyn Farkas,
a senior Pentagon official for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia during the
Obama administration. "How would they respond if there was a nuclear
detonation or a nuclear weapon used by Russia? And same for chemical and
biological."

**[[The emerging consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}** among the Washington
foreign policy establishment, both right and left,
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** that the **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration **[[deserves]{.mark} [praise for how
it]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}has **[[handled this crisis and
shepherded NATO quickly to respond to Russian aggression]{.mark}. [NATO
has been unified]{.mark}]{.underline}** with providing Ukraine with
weapons, sanctioning Russia, and beginning to address the new influx of
refugees.

#### Momentum is driving NATO unity now

**Erlanger, 22** \-- NY Times chief diplomatic correspondent in Europe

\[Steven Erlanger, \"Fear of Russia Brings New Purpose and Unity to
NATO, Once Again,\" NY Times, 1-14-2022,

[**[Fear of Russia Brings New]{.underline}**]{.mark} Purpose and
**[[Unity to NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Once Again

After years of drift, Trumpian ridicule and failure in Afghanistan,
**[Russian demands]{.underline}** for a new Iron Curtain in Europe have
**[created unity in the alliance]{.underline}**, at least for now.

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO was an alliance in search
of a role. Some suggested that if NATO did not "go out of area," beyond
Europe, it would "go out of business."

Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 revived NATO's central importance
as a counterweight to Moscow. But the alliance still seemed on its way
to obsolescence, hobbled by a lack of purpose and disunity.

Former President Donald J. Trump ridiculed it and threatened to abandon
it. President Emmanuel Macron of France bemoaned its "brain death." The
European Union pressed for "strategic autonomy" from Washington.

But Russian President Vladimir V. **[[Putin's extraordinary]{.mark}
new]{.underline}** demands and **[[threats]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
following his military buildup on the borders of Ukraine, **[has
[brought NATO back to basics --- containing
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**n power and imperium.

Mr. Putin's insistence that NATO stop enlargement and remove allied
forces from member states bordering Russia would draw a new Iron Curtain
across Europe, and that threat has concentrated minds. **[[It may be
just what a lagging alliance]{.mark} has [needed]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

"[**[NATO relies on momentum, and a lot of]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
**[[momentum is generated by]{.mark} a sense of threat and
[fear]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former
senior intelligence officer dealing with Russia, now with the Center for
a New American Security.

After last year's fiasco of Afghanistan and the humiliation of France in
the Australian submarine deal, she said, "We were all thinking that we
have serious problems in the alliance, and we might need to rethink the
foundation of this relationship."

But **[in talks]{.underline}** this week with the Russians, **[[NATO
leaders spoke with exceptional unity]{.underline}]{.mark}** for a
30-member alliance whose commitment to collective defense was
increasingly in question.

The talks allowed Mr. Putin to revisit Russian grievances over how the
Cold War ended, in hopes of placing them back on the table for
renegotiation 30 years later. His deputy foreign minister, Aleksandr V.
Grushko, even warned the alliance off a "policy of containment" of
Russia and insisted that "free choice does not exist in international
relations" --- suggesting that Ukraine would have to bow to Russian
wishes.

But the more the discussion evoked the Cold War --- with its firm
dividing line through Europe, and its competing Russian and Western
systems and spheres of influence --- the more it reminded European and
American allies of NATO's purpose.

"**[[Deterring Russia is in the DNA of NATO]{.mark}, because Russia is
what can bring existential threats to European nations,"]{.underline}**
said Anna Wieslander, chair of Sweden's Institute for Security and
Development.

That threat now is more than territorial, she said. Russia is also
trying to undermine NATO's democratic cohesion. "Russia is targeting our
elections, our social media, our parliaments and our citizens, and it is
become more obvious now that Russia is not part of our value system,"
Ms. Wieslander said.

As it drafts a new strategic concept to be ready this year, NATO is
concentrating on "resilience" against new hybrid and cyberthreats,
highlighting its defense of the democratic institutions of member
states, not just their territory.

"NATO is its member states, and it's what allies make of it," said
Sophia Besch, a defense analyst in Berlin for the Center for European
Reform. "It's not out of business because we didn't let it, and we've
changed its raison d'être to what are the major strategic concerns of
the day."

The old joke was that if NATO is the answer, what is the question? Ms.
Besch responded: "We've changed the question over the years to make NATO
the answer. And now we're back at the old question again, where NATO is
more comfortable."

NATO is especially important now for those states bordering Russia, like
the Baltic nations and Poland, a country which has had deepening strains
with its European partners over the protection of core democratic
principles, which Brussels has accused the government in Warsaw of
eroding.

But the current crisis is a reminder, even in Poland, of the importance
of the alliance as a whole, and not just the country's bilateral
relationship with the United States, said Piotr Buras, head of the
Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. Ukraine has
proved especially vulnerable to Russian threats perhaps precisely
because it is not a NATO member.

"In Poland there was concern that NATO would lose its focus on Russian
security threats, but now it's obvious that this is the only framework
that can protect us and provide long-term security," Mr. Buras said.

There was also anxiety that President Biden, in trying to stabilize
relations with Russia to pivot toward China, would bargain away
forward-based NATO troops in Poland and the Baltics that were deployed
after 2014.

"But **[[there is no sign]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[will
give in on fundamental issues]{.mark} to NATO]{.underline}**," like its
open-door policy and its right to deploy forces in any member state, Mr.
Buras said, and Washington has been rigorous in briefing its allies
about all of its discussions with Russia.

Still, he said, the current crisis "is a very clear consequence of the
U.S. pivot to Asia and the realization of Russia that it might now take
advantage of that reorientation of U.S. fundamental security interests,"
he said. "And that issue will not go away soon."

Russia will continue to press for a new security framework in Europe,
and Europe without the United States is not prepared to play any
significant role, he said, so "for Poland, NATO is the key and
irreplaceable element."

Even as Poland's battle with the European Union over the rule of law
still festers, it is not an overt issue in the military alliance of
NATO. But it was very noticeable that as the crisis over Ukraine
mounted, President Andrzej Duda of Poland chose to veto a law,
criticized by Washington, which would have stripped majority ownership
of an independent television station from an American company.

As the security situation in Central Europe has worsened with Russian
aggression and threats, Poland "got what we finally wanted when we
joined NATO, which is allied and American troop presence on our soil ---
to finally bring NATO deployments beyond Germany," said Michal
Baranowski, who heads the Warsaw office of the German Marshall Fund.

That is precisely one of Russia's current demands --- that those
deployments in Poland and the Baltic States be removed, a demand
rejected by Mr. Biden and by NATO, to Poland's relief.

Still, Mr. Baranowski said, the Russians have mobilized the largest
military force in Europe since 1989, "and that's scary." The alliance,
he said, "is closer to military confrontation, but at least we have not
folded."

But the crisis has also highlighted the continuing dependence of NATO on
Washington. For Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO, what is
striking is how much "this is the old NATO, where the U.S. is the glue,
linchpin and indispensable leader of the alliance," bringing allies
together, informing them and "putting on the table the strategy we will
pursue."

What is extraordinary, he said, is that more than 70 years after the
alliance was founded, "**[[there appears]{.mark} to be [no independent
European]{.mark} strategy or even a European [point of view different
from]{.mark} what [Washington]{.mark} brought to the table." NATO has
divisions, of course]{.underline}**, Mr. Daalder said. "**[But [all the
divisions are dissolved]{.mark}]{.underline}**, at least for today."

### UQ: Capabilities

#### Troop boost proves

**[[NATO to boost its forces]{.mark}, equipment [on eastern
flank]{.mark}]{.underline}**

NATO defense ministers on Thursday discussed ways to bolster forces and
deterrence along the military alliance's eastern borders to dissuade
Russia from planning further aggression in the wake of its invasion of
Ukraine.

**[[The]{.mark} Russian [invasion ]{.mark}]{.underline}**has **[[led
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** to rethink strategies and **[[to
agree]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[NATO forces should be present in
greater numbers]{.mark} on that eastern flank.
[NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}says it has **[[placed over 40,000
troops under its direct command]{.underline}]{.mark}**, mainly on the
eastern flank, **[[and is looking at how it can further
strengthen]{.mark} its]{.underline}** presence, readiness, and
**[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"**[[This will mean more NATO forward-deployed]{.mark} combat
[formations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, to strengthen our battlegroups in
the eastern part of the alliance, more air, sea and cyber defenses, as
well as pre-positioned equipment and weapons stockpiles," NATO Secretary
General Jens Stoltenberg said after the meeting.

The meeting of defense ministers came ahead of a June 29-30 NATO summit
in Madrid that will seek to set a roadmap for the alliance in coming
years.

[**[Germany]{.underline}**]{.mark} has **[already [announced]{.mark} its
[plans to strengthen its engagement]{.mark} in Lithuania]{.underline}**,
while **[[France wants to increase its presence]{.mark} in
Romania]{.underline}**, where it plans to have deployed 1,000 troops
with Leclerc tanks by the end of the year.

U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin declined to detail any changes in
America's positioning of forces across Europe but said the U.S. and its
allies will take steps to rapidly deploy troops if needed. That includes
positioning more equipment in the region and putting troops on higher
levels of alert.

"All of our [**[allies]{.underline}**]{.mark} have [**[learned
from]{.underline}**]{.mark} any [**[shortcomings]{.underline}**]{.mark}
that we may have experienced in the past, and **[[they'll build to
ensure]{.mark} that [they have the right capabilities]{.mark} to provide
flexible and responsible and combat-credible forces]{.underline}** when
the time comes," he said.

Artis Pabriks, the Latvian defense minister, said the military alliance
should position larger armed forces and material in Baltic countries.

"We want an improved planning. We want a headquarters structure. We want
pre-positioning of different types of equipment, so if a crisis would
come we should not wait," he said.

Stoltenberg said the question of pre-positioned equipment is a crucial
one, because moving armored vehicles, supplies and ammunition takes a
lot of time.

"Then of course it's much easier and faster to reinforce when needed,"
he said.

Stoltenberg said **[[ministers made "significant progress]{.mark}" in
their discussions on a new force model]{.underline}** that would involve
more forces at higher readiness and others assigned to the defense of
specific allies.

Discussions in Brussels also focused on the need for more defense
spending, Stoltenberg said, with the bids from Sweden and Finland to
join the alliance also on the table.

Stoltenberg saluted the United States' decision to send an additional
\$1 billion in military aid to Ukraine and said NATO allies are
"prepared to continue to provide substantial, unprecedented support" to
the country.

The latest package, the U.S. said, includes anti-ship missile launchers,
howitzers and more rounds for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems
that U.S. forces are training Ukrainian troops on. All are key weapons
systems that Ukrainian leaders have urgently requested as they battle to
stall Russia's march to conquer the eastern Donbas region.

Austin praised the "historic decision" by Finland and Sweden to apply
for NATO membership, expressing his hopes that discussions will continue
to progress favorably.

**[Ukraine's western backers are sending more than 1,000
Stingers]{.underline}** in all. The missiles have so far not seen much
use, as Russia's Air Force is flying fewer missions at higher altitudes
than originally anticipated. Analysts believe, however, that as Russia
exhausts its inventory of precision-guided weapons, it will be forced to
drop unguided bombs from lower altitudes, bringing them within Stinger's
engagement envelope. The Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania
all sent an unknown number of Stinger missiles before the war.

Field Artillery

**[NATO]{.underline}** and the European Union nations
**[are]{.underline}** contributing relatively few artillery pieces,
**[concentrating with laser-like focus on providing anti-tank and
anti-aircraft weapons to blunt Russia's core strengths]{.underline}**.
Artillery is also heavier and can be quickly neutralized if it does not
regularly relocate.

And so how **[do you see the US sustaining]{.underline}** this level of
**[support for Ukraine in a way that could actually make a difference in
embattled regions like the Donbas]{.underline}**, which is suffering
significantly right now?

CHRISTINE WORMUTH: I think---you know, I think **[the administration has
done]{.underline}**, frankly, **[an admirable job]{.underline}**, you
know, **[helping the alliance come together and have the very, very
strong unified position that we've had against the Russian invasion, and
I think we'll continue to see that unity]{.underline}**, frankly. **[It
will take work]{.underline}**. I know from my own experience, you know,
back in 2014 and 2015 **[it takes a lot of active diplomacy to be able
to sustain that alliance unity.]{.underline}** But I think, you know,
all of the NATO countries see what is at stake, frankly, in what's
happening, and that alone, I think, is an incentive for us to maintain
unity. I think, you know, in a practical way, we are looking---you know,
certainly in the Department of Defense and in the Army---at how---you
know, what do we need to be doing to allow us to continue to sustain the
kind of lethal assistance that we're providing to the Ukrainians? And
that's why we've signed contracts to replenish our Stingers and
replenish our Javelins. You know, we have really leaned into trying to
provide, you know, everything that the policymakers deem essential to

### AT Thumpers

#### NATO unity is high now- thumpers before the invasion are irrelevant

**Livingston, 22** \-- Texas Tribune Washington bureau chief

credit NATO's efficacy for containing the Russian aggression to
Ukraine.]{.underline}**

Republican U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin is the top House
Republican on foreign affairs and voted to support NATO. On Wednesday,
he sported a blue-and-gold Ukrainian ribbon on his suit jacket at the
Capitol.

He told The Texas Tribune that **[[NATO countries are "stepping up" in
ways some]{.mark} countries had [lagged before]{.mark}]{.underline}**. A
frequent conservative critique of NATO is that many European countries
fall short of the expected standard that all member countries spend at
least 2% of their GDP on defense.

"**[[NATO is more unified than it's ever been]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Germany now is putting in 2% of their GDP. And they are sending weapons
and they are training," he said.

NATO bonds further frayed in recent years, as Trump regularly railed
against the alliance. But his criticism did lead to several NATO
countries deciding to increase their defense spending.

**[[Everything changed]{.underline}]{.mark}** six weeks ago
**[[when]{.underline}]{.mark}** Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin
invaded]{.underline}]{.mark}** Ukraine, a country on the Eastern
European frontier that long aspired to join the organization. Several
NATO countries located near Ukraine, like Poland, are most impacted by
the refugee exodus from Ukraine.

**Soare, 21** \-- Research Fellow for Defence and Military Analysis

\[Simona, \"Algorithmic power, NATO and artificial intelligence,\" IISS,

[**[NATO]{.underline}**]{.mark} has formally [**[approved its
first]{.underline}**]{.mark} Artificial Intelligence [**[(AI)
strategy]{.underline}**]{.mark} as it seeks a leading position in the
adoption of AI for defence, but it may face some critical hurdles ahead
in implementing the strategy, according to Simona Soare.

NATO defence ministers have formally adopted the Alliance's first
artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. The document lays out six
'baseline' principles for 'responsible' military use of AI --
lawfulness, responsibility and accountability, explainability and
traceability, reliability, governability, and bias mitigation. It also
provides an insight into key implementation challenges.

**[The strategy is meant [to provide a 'common]{.mark} policy
[basis']{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}to support the adoption of AI
systems in order to achieve the Alliance's three core tasks --
collective defence, crisis management and cooperative security. The
strategy is also designed to challenge established Alliance processes
for procurement, technology development and wider engagement with the
private sector and academia.

Only a summary of the strategy has been made public. However, **[[it
reveals]{.underline}]{.mark}** four **[[critical obstacles to
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[NATO will face:
[reconciling]{.mark} the [objectives]{.mark} of member nations;
[securing sufficient political ]{.mark}]{.underline}**and financial
**[[support; bridging]{.underline}]{.mark}** any **[[disconnect]{.mark}
between]{.underline}** the Alliance's **[policy and operational units;
[and managing the]{.mark} transnational
[bureaucracy]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}that will implement the
strategy.

Hard questions

As well as being a consensus-building policy document, the strategy
attempts to position NATO as the leader of AI adoption in defence. It
reiterates the allies' commitment to transatlantic cooperation on the
development and use of AI in security and defence, an important element
of which is ensuring inter-operability and standardisation.

**[There are still hard questions]{.underline}**, however, about how
NATO will coordinate different national approaches to managing the
development and application of AI in defence, combined with restrictions
on technology use, access, sharing and transfer. For countries like the
United States, it is a priority that allies agree practical guidelines
for the operational use of AI-enabled systems and the necessary
data-sharing, a challenge that should not be underestimated. Some
allies, meanwhile, are not satisfied with the granularity of the six
principles of responsible use, while others consider that
overemphasising the normative approach risks ceding technological
advantage to peer competitors.

Similar tensions are playing out in the European Union. The EU's
proposal for an AI act is more restrictive for high-risk, high-impact
applications of AI, though its impact on defence will be indirect, as it
do does not apply to the military domain. In the defence realm, the
European Defence Agency's Artificial Intelligence Action Plan for
Defence shares more similarities with the NATO strategy. While the plan
is not public, it reportedly includes a list of use cases for military
applications of AI which member states may consider for collaborative
development and principles of responsible development and use.

[**[A]{.underline}**n]{.mark}other **[[question that remains to be
answered is the extent of NATO's ambition to adopt AI. The strategy is
meant to be implemented in a phased approach]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
partly **[[to build]{.mark} political [support for AI military projects.
Initial ambitions seem modest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, reportedly
focusing on mission planning and support; smart maintenance and
logistics for NATO capabilities; data fusion and analysis; cyber
defence; and optimisation of back-office processes. **[As political
acceptance grows and [following periodic reviews]{.mark} of the
strategy's implementation, [the goal is to also include more
complex]{.mark} operational [applications]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

#### Thumpers are [priced in]{.underline} as long as Biden avoids unilateral actions

**Lesser, 21** \-- vice president at The German Marshall Fund of the
United States

\[Ian, \"Great Optimism in the EU and NATO as Brussels Looks to Biden,\"
GMFUS, xx-xx-xxxx,
https://www.gmfus.org/news/great-optimism-eu-and-nato-brussels-looks-biden,
accessed 6-4-2022\]

[**[After years of transatlantic stress,
officials]{.underline}**]{.mark} and observers **[in Brussels
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}that a
[**[Biden]{.underline}**]{.mark} administration [**[holds the prospect
of profound change in style]{.underline}**]{.mark} and policy. **[[There
will]{.mark} continue to [be]{.mark} areas of [disagreement. But the
overall approach]{.mark} from Washington [is sure to be more
engaging]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}and closer to mainstream
European policy preferences. From economics to security, **[[Europe
values predictability in U.S. leadership]{.mark}, something that has
been in remarkably short supply under]{.underline}** the
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration.

**[The anticipated shift is likely to]{.underline}** be most
**[profound]{.underline}** from the perspective of the EU and its
institutions. Among member states, there was always a spectrum of views
about Donald Trump. The outgoing administration's approach enjoyed a
degree of support in right-wing and nationalist circles, including
several governments in Central and Eastern Europe. For some, this was a
matter of ideology. For others it was a cooler geopolitical calculus. In
general, however, the [**[Trump]{.underline}**]{.mark} administration
[**[was derided for its]{.underline}**]{.mark} brash **[unil[ateral
style as much as its policy choices]{.mark}]{.underline}**, most of
which were at odds with EU preferences. The list of sharp differences
ranged from climate policy to trade, from Iran to the World Health
Organization.

Above all, Trump and his key advisors were seen as dismissive of, or
even opposed to, the idea of the EU itself. For them, international
politics seemed to be about nation states, often individual
leaders---some seen positively, most seen negatively. The traditional
U.S. attachment to the "European project" had become the preserve of a
foreign policy elite with little influence on Trump and his circle. A
Biden administration should spell a return to the traditional balance in
transatlantic relations, with the EU itself taken seriously again
alongside relations with France, Germany, and others.

On substance, there is a realization that **[it may not all be smooth
sailing]{.underline}** across the Atlantic. Trade and digital policy are
widely assumed to be the most challenging areas. Indeed, there is some
concern that Biden may find it difficult to move away from the
protectionist stance that has taken hold in recent years, against the
backdrop of similar pressures in Europe and elsewhere. On other fronts,
the outlook is for closer consultation and convergence. EU leaders will
welcome a U.S. return to the Paris climate accords and the World Health
Organization. Biden has signaled a desire to bring the United States
back into the multilateral nuclear agreement with Iran. A Biden
administration is assumed to be more interested in and willing to assist
with a host of problems on Europe's periphery, from Africa to the
Eastern Mediterranean.

In some respects, NATO was one of the areas least affected by Trump's
approach to the world. The U.S. military presence in Europe has grown
modestly but steadily; a trend that began under President Barack Obama.
U.S. complaints about defense burden-sharing were nothing new, even if
the style was more abrasive. But from the start, Trump spread anxiety
about the solidity of the U.S. commitment to European defense. It never
quite came to a disavowal of Article V, and Trump would have faced a
very tough bipartisan battle if he ever wished to leave NATO as he
hinted on more than one occasion. By contrast, it is assumed that a
Biden administration would put NATO back at the core of U.S. strategy.
In policy terms, the emphasis on increased European defense spending
will surely continue. There will be a tougher and more predictable line
on Russia, coupled with an interest in new arms-control arrangements.
**[[Biden is]{.mark} a [well-known]{.mark} figure [in NATO]{.mark}
circles. [For the alliance,]{.mark} a [Biden]{.mark} administration
[will be a return to the known world and an energizing
element]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the institution.

RFE/RL: So do you think NATO is going to be able to declare that Sweden

Once again, **[the question is what will mollify]{.underline}** Mr.
**[Erdogan and ensure his support for]{.underline}** admitting **[Sweden
and Finland.]{.underline}**

President Biden underscored U.S. support for the move when he hosted the
two nations' leaders at the White House this month and praised a larger
NATO as a check against Russian power. "Biden took an extremely exposed,
high-visibility position by inviting them to Washington," said James F.
Jeffrey, a U.S. ambassador to Turkey during the Obama administration.

[**[Most analysts believe]{.underline}**]{.mark} that Mr. **[[Erdogan
will not ultimately block]{.mark} the [accession]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[]{.mark}of Sweden and Finland, **[[but that he wants
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** highlight Turkey's own security concerns and
[**[make domestic political gains before
elections]{.underline}**]{.mark} in his country next year.

Mr. Erdogan is mainly concerned with Sweden's longtime support for the
Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., which seeks an independent Kurdish
state on territory partly within Turkey's borders.

The P.K.K., which has attacked nonmilitary targets and killed civilians
in Turkey, is outlawed in that country and is designated by both the
United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization,
although some governments, including Sweden, view it more
sympathetically as a Kurdish nationalist movement.

The United States has also backed its affiliated fighters in Syria, the
Y.P.G., or People's Protection Units, who helped to battle the Islamic
State and whom Mr. Erdogan attacked in his 2019 incursion into the
country.

The Turkish president wants the Y.P.G. to be designated as a terrorist
group as well.

Mr. Erdogan accuses both Finland and Sweden of harboring followers of
Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in U.S. exile, whom he blames
for the 2016 coup. Turkey is requesting the extradition of roughly 35
people it says are involved with Kurdish separatists or Mr. Gulen.

Mr. Erdogan also objects to Swedish and Finnish arms embargoes against
his country, which were imposed after the 2019 incursion into Syria.
Sweden is already discussing lifting the embargo given current events in
Ukraine.

Some analysts say that Mr. Erdogan's government views the P.K.K. much
the way Washington saw Al Qaeda 20 years ago, and that the West cannot
dismiss the concerns if it hopes to do business with Turkey.

**[[Biden]{.mark} administration [officials downplay the standoff and
expect]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}Mr. **[[Erdogan to reach a
compromise]{.mark} with Finland and Sweden.]{.underline}** Turkish
officials met in Ankara with Finnish and Swedish counterparts for
several hours last week.

Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in an interview that
"this appears to be an issue that they have with Sweden and Finland, so
we'll leave it in their hands." She added that the United States would
provide assistance if needed.

Appearing with Finland's foreign minister in Washington on Friday,
**[Secretary of State]{.underline}** Antony J. **[[Blinken said he was
"confident]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[we will work through
this]{.mark} process [swiftly]{.mark}, and that things will move forward
with both countries."]{.underline}**

Emre **[[Peker]{.mark}, a London-based director for Europe at the
Eurasia Group]{.underline}**, a private consulting firm, **[said that he
did not believe]{.underline}** that Mr. **[Erdogan was seeking
concessions from Washington. [He expressed confidence]{.mark} that
[Turkey could work out an agreement]{.mark} with Sweden and Finland with
the mediation of the NATO secretary general]{.underline}**, Jens
Stoltenberg.

One frequently cited justification for admitting [**[Finland and

larger U.S. naval presence in the Baltic Sea, calling into question the
ability of their military to secure their own backyard.

systems, [**[Secretary-General]{.underline}**]{.mark} Jens
[**[Stoltenberg said]{.underline}**]{.mark} on Thursday.

He spoke after the Kremlin warned that Western arms supplies to Ukraine,
including heavy weapons, posed a threat to the security of the European
continent \"and provoke instability\". read more

\"We need to be prepared for the long term,\" Stoltenberg told a youth
summit in Brussels. \"There is absolutely the possibility that this war
will drag on and last for months and years.\"

The NATO chief said the West would continue to put maximum pressure on
Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the invasion of Ukraine, which
Moscow calls a \"special military operation\", through sanctions and
economic as well as military aid to Kyiv.

\"**[[NATO allies are preparing to provide support over a long period of
time]{.underline}]{.mark}** and also help Ukraine to transit, move from
old Soviet-era equipment to more modern NATO-standard weapons and
systems that will also require more training,\" Stoltenberg said.

Most of the heavy weapons NATO countries have sent to Ukraine so far are
Soviet-built arms still in the inventories of east European NATO member
states, but the United States and some other allies have started to
supply Kyiv with Western howitzers.

Germany on Tuesday announced the shipment of Gepard tanks equipped with
anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, the first time Berlin has approved heavy
weapons deliveries for Kyiv. read more

Ukraine\'s pleas for heavy weapons have intensified since Moscow shifted
its offensive to the Donbas, an eastern region with largely flat, open
terrain seen as better suited for tank battles than the areas in the
north around the capital Kyiv where much of the earlier fighting took
place.

**[with Russia]{.underline}**, Says Polish PM

NATO and the West must be "in the fight for the long haul" economically,
diplomatically and militarily in supporting Ukraine against Russian
aggression, Poland's prime minister said Tuesday.

Although drawing the line at direct military confrontation, Mateusz
Morawiecki, in prepared remarks delivered by a Polish chancellery
official at the Atlantic Council, said, "it's up to us to win the
battle" of protecting Ukrainian sovereignty and blunting possible
Kremlin moves against alliance members.

"Ukraine is fighting this war not only for its security but ours." He
said **[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** Feb. 24 **[[invasion "turns out to
be a wake-up call"]{.underline}]{.mark}** to all of Europe about
President Vladimir Putin's ambitions in eastern and central Europe.

**[In response]{.underline}** to the invasion, the prime minister added,
"we, the **[[Europeans]{.underline}]{.mark}**, have to **[[step
up]{.underline}]{.mark}** our **[[defense
spending]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

Poland already meets the NATO threshold of spending 2 percent of its
gross domestic product on security. In light of the war in Ukraine,
**[[Warsaw intends]{.mark} [to raise that
percent]{.mark}]{.underline}**age in coming years.

[**[Morawiecki praised the]{.underline}**
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[for]{.mark} its "[stepped-up presence" on NATO's eastern flank to
signal]{.mark}]{.underline}** to Russia that **[[the alliance is
serious]{.underline}]{.mark}** about defense.

Mark Brzezinski, American ambassador to Poland, said that in Warsaw,
**[[there are now 12,600 American soldiers]{.mark} on Polish
bases.]{.underline}** Either arriving **[[with]{.underline}]{.mark}**
them or coming soon are **[M1A2 [Abrams]{.mark} main battle
[tanks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems
(**[[HIMARS) and F-35]{.underline}]{.mark}** Lightning II Joint Strike
**[Fighter[s]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"We are being tested, and Poland is under threat," he said when
explaining the reasoning behind the U.S. troop levels there.

Former ambassador to Poland, Daniel Fried, said, "we don't know who will
win" in Ukraine, but the Ukrainians "have a reasonable chance of
success." He said the West has to keep the pressure on Moscow. "We can't
screw this up."

Brzezinski added that **[[the movement of so many]{.mark} U.S. [forces
and so much equipment eastward]{.mark} from the U.S. and other bases in
Europe "[allow\[s\] NATO to stand firm]{.mark}]{.underline}**." He said

Prep for 'long haul' in Ukraine 'war of attrition:' NATO chief

**[NATO Secretary-General]{.underline}** Jens
**[Stoltenberg]{.underline}** Thursday **[said the Ukraine conflict had
become "a war of attrition," and the world must prep]{.underline}**are
**[for "the long haul"]{.underline}** before its end at a negotiating
table.

Speaking at the White House after meeting with US President Joe Biden,
Stoltenberg said it was up to Ukraine alone to decide what to negotiate
over when that time came, and NATO's obligation was to help Kyiv defend
its sovereignty.

He said the Ukrainians were "paying a high price for defending their own
country," but Russia was "taking high casualties."

"We just have to be prepared for the long haul. What we see is that this
war has now become a war of attrition," said the head of the US-led
transatlantic military alliance.

Stoltenberg also met Vice President Harris and National Security Adviser
Jake Sullivan at the White House ahead of the June 29-30 NATO summit in
Madrid.

The NATO chief said the planned summit in the Spanish capital "takes
place at a pivotal time for our security" in the wake of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine.

"[**[We will make sure]{.underline}**]{.mark} that [**[NATO continues to
adapt]{.underline}**]{.mark} to a more competitive world, with strategic
competition and where we see the impact on our security from
authoritarian powers like Russia and China," he said.

Stoltenberg recalled that Russian President Vladimir **[[Putin]{.mark}
attacked Ukraine because he "[wanted less NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

"**[[But]{.mark} he [is getting more NATO, with more NATO presence in
the eastern part]{.mark} of the alliance [and]{.mark} also with [more
members]{.mark},"]{.underline}** he said.

**[He referred to [Finland and Sweden]{.mark} applying for
membership]{.underline}** to the military bloc, saying "they are
historic decisions" **[that [will "strengthen NATO and strengthen
our]{.mark} transatlantic [bond]{.mark}]{.underline}**."

**[[NATO wants]{.mark} to set]{.underline}** AI **[[standards. If only
its members agreed]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the basics.

**[[Big differences]{.mark} over how to treat autonomous weapons [could
undermine NATO's drive]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

**[On paper, NATO is the ideal organization]{.underline}** to go about
setting standards for military applications of artificial intelligence.
**[But the [widely divergent priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
budgets **[[of its 30 members could get in the
way]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Western military alliance has identified artificial intelligence as
a key technology needed to maintain an edge over adversaries, and it
wants to lead the way in establishing common ground rules for its use.

"We need each other more than ever. No country alone or no continent
alone can compete in this era of great power competition," NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the alliance's second in command, said
in an interview with POLITICO.

The standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications in the military largely free of democratic oversight.

David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary general for emerging security
challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of concern with the tech\'s ethical
implications has sped along the integration of AI into the military
apparatus.

\"I\'m \... not sure that they\'re having the same debates on principles
of responsible use or they\'re definitely not applying our democratic
values to these technologies," he said.

Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll out the world\'s first
binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is seeking closer collaboration
with Washington to oversee emerging technologies, including artificial
intelligence. But those efforts have been slow in getting off the
ground.

For Geoană, that collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working
closely with the European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on
"high risk" applications.

The pitch

NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a standard, it becomes in
terms of defensive security the gold standard in that respective field,"
Geoană said.

The alliance\'s own AI strategy, to be released before the summer, will
identify ways to operate AI systems responsibly, identify military
applications for the technology, and provide a "platform for allies to
test their AI to see whether it\'s up to NATO standards," van Weel said.

The strategy will also set ethical guidelines around how to govern AI
systems, for example by ensuring systems can be shut down by a human at
all times, and to maintain accountability by ensuring a human is
responsible for the actions of AI systems.

"If an adversary would use autonomous AI powered systems in a way that
is not compatible with our values and morals, it would still have
defense implications because we would need to defend and deter against
those systems," van Weel said.

"We need to be aware of that and we need to flag legislators when we
feel that our restrictions are coming into the realm of \[being
detrimental to\] our defense and deterrence," he continued.

**[[Mission impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**?

**[[The problem is]{.underline}]{.mark}** that **[[NATO\'s members are
at very different stages]{.underline}]{.mark}** when it comes to
thinking about AI in the military context.

The U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use
of AI in the defense realm. But **[in Europe, [most]{.mark}
countries]{.underline}** --- France and the Netherlands excepting ---
**[[barely mention]{.mark} the
[tech]{.mark}]{.underline}**nology**[['s]{.mark} [defense]{.mark} and
military [implications]{.mark}]{.underline}** in their national AI
strategies.

"It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy
before it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it
exactly the other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy
fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said:

That echoes familiar transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also
highlights the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly.

The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently.

**[[There are]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[divergences over what
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies **[[the alliance ought to
develop]{.underline}]{.mark}**, including lethal autonomous weapons
systems --- often dubbed "killer robots" --- programmed to identify and
destroy targets without human control.

Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the U.S. have
developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons, while
others like Belgium and Germany have expressed serious concerns about
the technology.

These weapons systems have also faced fierce public opposition from
civil society and human rights groups, including from United Nations
Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018 called for a ban.

Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon systems as part
of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that its upcoming
recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology without
"stifling innovation."

Staying relevant

These issues threaten to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting drive. \"I
think there's a certain danger that if NATO doesn't take this on as a
real challenge, that it may be marginalized by other such efforts,"
Franke said.

She pointed to the U.S.-led AI Partnership for Defense, which consists
of 13 countries from Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI use in the
military context --- a forum which could supplant NATO as the
standard-setting body.

That could have consequences for human rights, too.

"NATO... is a great place to responsibly think about how to harness the
good parts of this technology and how to prohibit the parts that would
be catastrophic for humanitarian law and human rights law, and people at
the end of the day," said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty
International, which is part of the Stop Killer Robots campaign.

"Without oversight mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and measures,
which would guarantee that this technology will operate under meaningful
human control" NATO's strategy could head into an "ethical vacuum,"
Coyle said.

Franke said **[[it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the
basics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like increased data sharing to develop
and train military AI and cooperating on using artificial intelligence
in logistics.

#### The plan sets off a slow, time-consuming consensus-building process

For those of us who study the NATO acquisition process, **[[it is almost
impossible to imagine the alliance]{.underline}]{.mark}** identifying a
requirement and **[[adopting a solution]{.underline}]{.mark}** so
**[[quickly]{.underline}]{.mark}**, no matter how urgent the
circumstances. **[[Among the]{.mark} many [challenges would]{.mark}
[be]{.mark} the alliance's elaborate, [consensus-based governing]{.mark}
structure, [as well as]{.mark} the [divergent interests]{.mark} and
funding mechanisms among the 30 member states.]{.underline}** This is
why, in 2016, the International Board of Auditors concluded that NATO
struggles to provide commanders with required capabilities on time and
estimated that common-funded capabilities required an average of 16
years from development to delivery.

The complexity of modern weapons systems and the challenges of
interoperability mean that any active engagement will lead to the
identification of new technical requirements for NATO. The alliance
needs the processes and structures in place to rapidly identify these
requirements and procure solutions. This includes giving commanders the
authority to make decisions without the lengthy consensus-building
approach that may be reasonable, if slow, in peacetime but is not
effective during war.

First Steps

NATO has previously sought to improve the governance, speed, and
efficiency of its capability-delivery process. For example, in 2018 NATO
adopted a new governance model for common-funded capabilities. It has
undertaken efforts to enhance collaboration between strategic commands
(Allied Command Operations in Mons, Belgium and Allied Command
Transformation in Norfolk, VA), called for the exploration of
alternative acquisition strategies to support technology development,
and created the Office of the Chief Information Officer to accelerate
the delivery of computer and information systems. Furthermore, in
October 2021 NATO launched the first \$1.1 billion Innovation Fund, and
last month announced the creation of the first ever Defense Innovation
Accelerator for the North Atlantic to harness cutting-edge technologies
as part of the NATO 2030 agenda.

These are valuable steps, but they do not address the fundamental
challenge of rapidly acquiring common capabilities. **[[There
are]{.mark} still [many residual processes where consensus]{.mark}-based
control [is inherently prioritized]{.mark}]{.underline}** over speed,
flexibility, innovation, and the deployment of prototypes at the end of
their development phases.

NATO leaders recognize the ongoing challenge. In a recent speech to the
North Atlantic Council, the supreme allied commander transformation,
Gen. Philippe Lavigne, stressed that one of his key priorities is to
ensure the timely delivery of new and critical capabilities, adding that
"we need to change the rules and make them work for us, not against us."
But **[[NATO leaders cannot fix this alone]{.underline}]{.mark}** ---
**[the alliance's [30 member]{.mark}]{.underline}**
nation**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** are the ones that **[[will have to
agree]{.underline}]{.mark}** on the solution. Exploring alternatives and
**[[getting the allies to agree]{.underline}]{.mark}** on a solution
**[[will be difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It can happen on a
NATO-wide basis, or some subset of member nations can take on the
challenge and lead the effort, which may then be adopted by others.

**[Emerging]{.underline}** and disruptive **[tech]{.underline}**nologies

Industrial cooperation and technological innovation is a subject that
has been gaining ground in NATO circles in recent years, particularly
with regard to emerging and disruptive technologies. It is true that the
**[[economic interests]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the companies based
**[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[member]{.mark} countrie[s]{.mark}
[differ]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and that **[[so far NATO has not managed

Further]{.underline}**more, **[[the EU's aspiration to attain strategic
autonomy, and the]{.mark} particular [attention it pays to]{.mark}

**[aspect of defence, [heralded]{.mark}]{.underline}** another episode
of **[transatlantic [discord]{.mark}]{.underline}**, now on the way to
being healed thanks to the concept of so-called 'open' strategic
autonomy, which will enable non-EU-member allies to take part in its
industrial and technological initiatives.

**[Added to the discrepancies between allies]{.underline}** there
**[is]{.underline}** now the need to address the challenge posed by
**[emerging tech]{.underline}**nologies and those threatening to disrupt
the traditional military superiority of the Alliance. In this context,
**[the NATO 2030 report emphasises the importance]{.underline}** of the
Alliance **[maintaining its technological lead]{.underline}** over
possible rivals and warns of the progress made by China in terms of
innovation. The adoption of NATO's first Artificial Intelligence
strategy in 2021, the setting up of the Defence Innovation Accelerator
of the North Atlantic (DIANA) and the launch of the NATO Innovation Fund
in October 2021\[13\] are tangible progress in the chapter of
technological innovation and is destined to play a prominent role in the
Madrid summit and Strategic Concept.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was the most successful
collective security arrangement among states in the 20th century. Having
deterred and outlasted its primary adversary, the Soviet Union, NATO now
faces the challenge of redefining its roles and purposes in the 21st
century. **[Like all pluralist organizations, the Alliance must reflect
the common interests of its 28 members, and [defining common interests
that motivate all members]{.mark}]{.underline}** to sacrifice for the
good of the whole **[[has been difficult.]{.mark} [In the absence of a
direct common military threat, disparate
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}**, commitments, **[and
visions]{.underline}** of the transatlantic future **[have
[fragmented]{.mark} Alliance [coherence]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The Strategic Concept adopted by heads of state and government in Lisbon
in November 2010 reconfirms the NATO commitment to "deter and defend
against any threat of aggression, and against emerging security
challenges where they threaten the fundamental security of individual
Allies or the Alliance as a whole."1 It offers itself as the strategic
map for NATO in the 21\* century and touches on extremism, terrorism,
and such transnational illegal activities as trafficking in arms,
narcotics, and people, as well as cyber attacks and other technological
and environmental threats. The Strategic Concept, however, does not
refer to hybrid threats or provide insight into the magnitude,
likelihood, nature, or nuances of the "emerging security challenges."
Moreover, it does not address the possibility of having to face some or
many of these challenges simultaneously, or the threat posed by the
convergence of these many separate elements, which when braided together
constitute a threat of a different nature.

The new threat confronting the diverse nations of the Alliance is
insidious and not easily defined or identified. It flourishes in the
seams between states, and in the soft areas of bad or weak governance.
The new threat consists of distinct but tangled elements---hence the
rubric hybrid threat. Hybrid threats are much more than the amalgamation
of existing security challenges. This is due in part to the
interrelatedness of their constituent elements, the complicated and
interdependent nature of the activities required to counter them, the
multiplicity of key stakeholders with vested interests, and the dynamic
international security environment in which traditional military
solutions may not be best (or even a key component) but may nevertheless
be necessary. As NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has
recently stated, "The paradox \... is that the global order enjoys more
stakeholders than ever before, and yet it has very few guarantors."2

The task of articulating, elaborating, and developing these concepts has
been assigned to NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT). In the words
of one NATO/ACT official, the task is to "paint the face on the faceless
enemy\"5 and to develop the hybrid threat concept, as well as examine
viable and effective strategies to meet hybrid threats. A recent
experiment raised important issues concerning how NATO does business.
One of the issues raised was how NATO reaches out to important civilian
players who it may have to rely on or even support in its current and
future endeavors. Another topic was how the Alliance engages with
industry, particularly with the cyber and energy sectors as two key
areas identified in the Strategic Concept. Yet another issue is how NATO
deals with non-military threats that are nevertheless security dangers
to the Alliance but do not lend themselves easily to the traditional
Article 5 analysis. Lastly, the experiment asked whether NATO
bureaucracy and its processes have kept pace with a rapidly changing
world; or whether the Alliance is positioned to respond effectively to
the frightening pace of emerging security threats.

NATO in the 21st Century

As NATO positions itself to meet the diverse and complex security
challenges of the 21" century, it must carefully take stock of the needs
of all its members. In examining emerging threats, the following points
are salient:

❖ We need to be as secure against emerging threats as we were against
the conventional threats of the past.

❖ NATO was appropriate for security against past (that is, conventional)
threats.

❖ Its effectiveness against emerging threats should not be taken for
granted and must he demonstrated.

❖ We must understand the nature of the new threats.

❖ We must discover how these threats can be effectively countered.

❖ We must determine what role, if any, NATO can play in countering these
threats.

**[NATO operates by [consensus]{.mark}; it [has only been the presence
of an]{.mark} existential clearly [identifiable
threat]{.mark}]{.underline}** (the Soviet Union) **[that allowed the
Alliance to operate effectively]{.underline}** over the years.
**[[Because hybrid threats are not clearly
identifiable]{.underline}]{.mark}** and their existential nature is not
the subject of consensus, **[there is never an imperative to address the
challenge they pose.]{.underline}** One way of framing the issue,
therefore, is to say that we must demonstrate the existential nature of
the current threat or threats to provoke a discussion and decision about
how NATO wishes to respond. Without this, the **[[discussion
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** continue to **[[fall prey to conflicting
visions]{.mark} for NATO]{.underline}** within the Alliance.

NATO nations are all members of the United Nations (UN), and most belong
to the European Union (EU). So for any NATO member, **[[the starting
point]{.mark} in the discussion [will]{.mark}]{.underline}** not
necessarily **[be]{.underline}** [who]{.mark} NATO needs to work with to
counter emerging or hybrid threats, but rather **[to [what]{.mark}
extent [states want to work through NATO as opposed to
individually]{.mark}, or [through the UN, the EU, or other
alliances]{.mark}.]{.underline}** NATO action is complicated by the
blurred distinction between legality and legitimacy in an Alliance
intervention where there is no clear and unambiguous Article 5
justification.

The 1999 Kosovo intervention, for example, was widely perceived as
morally justified and therefore legitimate when compared to
nonintervention. Legality, on the other hand, will by definition depend
on a Security Council resolution sanctioning military intervention by
the international community. Despite the possibility of the Security
Council acting in what may be the political interest of its member
nations without being strictly moral by universal standards, it is
generally accepted that Security Council-sanctioned action is legitimate
by definition. In other words, all legal actions are legitimate, whereas
the opposite is not necessarily true. Or, to put it another way,
legality is a subset of legitimacy, and legitimacy is not for NATO alone
to determine. Allied leadership acknowledges this: "The UN Security
Council must remain the overall source of legitimacy for international
peace and stability.''4

Since it is widely held that UN sanction is a prerequisite for any kind
of legitimate civil-military intervention, **[[NATO's]{.mark} level of
[ambition will be effectively limited by]{.mark} what [the least willing
member]{.mark} country can agree to]{.underline}**.
**[This]{.underline}**, in turn, **[is decided by]{.underline}** the
degree of necessity from the point of view of the country least
threatened, or by the member for whom intervention policies are most
difficult for **[[domestic political reasons]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This dynamic has been clearly brought out by the current NATO
intervention in the Libyan conflict. **[This may [raise doubt about the
ability of NATO to deal with hybrid threa]{.mark}ts]{.underline}**,
other than as a forum for the creation of coalitions of the (most)
willing---provided there is also the necessary legitimacy.

**[Raising awareness among political leaders about]{.underline}** the
**[new tech]{.underline}**nologie**[s' impact on NATO may not be as
simple as it seems.]{.underline}** Currently, **[there is a growing gap
in perception of]{.underline}** the **[new
tech]{.underline}**nology**['s importance between the political and
military level.]{.underline}** Military authorities of the Alliance
have, for a long time, been highlighting the need for innovation and
adoption of new technologies.\[15\] Trials of innovative technological
solutions and new capabilities have been part of NATO's military
training and exercises. For example, NATO now regularly tests unmanned
systems in the maritime area\[16\] and there is work being done in the
area of Electronic Spectrum warfare. Furthermore, adoption of new
technologies in new capabilities development has been encouraged through
the NATO Defence Planning Process (NDPP). In 2018, the Allied Command
Transformation developed Emerging and Disruptive Technologies Roadmap,
which received political endorsement at the meeting of defence ministers
in June 2019.

**[On the political front, the effort has been slower]{.underline}**.
Until recently, **[the Allies]{.underline}** themselves have
**[maintained a rather declaratory approach to tech]{.underline}**nology
and innovation. Later, in 2020, the Secretary General appointed an
innovation advisory group to provide counsel on NATO's next steps in the
tech area. A full political strategy on the emerging and disruptive
technologies was finally adopted at the Brussels Summit in June 2021:
"\[T\]his strategy seeks to preserve our interoperability; safeguard our
sensitive technologies; and actively address the threats and challenges
posed by technological developments by others, both now and in the
future. Drawing on the extensive innovation expertise of all 30 Allies,
we will further leverage our partnerships, including with the private
sector and academia, to maintain our technological edge.\[17\]"

#### Emerging tech causes political friction

**Gilli, 21** \-- affiliate at CISAC and a Researcher at the NATO
Defense College

\[Andrea, \"NATO, technological superiority, and emerging and disruptive
technologies,\" NATO Defense College, 2021, jstor, accessed 6-4-22\]

Emerging and disruptive technologies. First, **[the rise
of]{.underline}** several **[emerging]{.underline}** and disruptive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies --- from artificial intelligence to
quantum computing, hypersonic weapons to 5G networks - **[has led many
to speculate that a new industrial revolution is coming.]{.underline}**
Whether this is correct will only be known ex post. What we do know, ex
ante, is that there will be both a process of convergence among
innovative countries, and a process of divergence between innovative and
non-innovative countries.18 Predicting which countries will lead and
which will lag is inevitably difficult. I Iowever, we can make some
educated guesses about the factors that will play a key role. Because of
the knowledge-intensive nature of the current technological
transformation, countries excelling in R&l) and education are more
likely to succeed.19 An important question concerns the ease of
appropriating others' knowledge and know-how. litis may determine the
shape and intensity of international competition: if barriers to
knowledge are high, the gap between the two groups will remain
significant. If barriers are low, technological capabilities will be
more diffused, with major implications for the structure of
international politics.

Technological revolution and long-term change. Second, while the word
"revolution" is often associated to sudden changes, technological
revolutions have been, in reality, the product of cumulative
processes.20This is because the adoption and diffusion of technolog)'
are slow and complicated, not least because of the need to invest in
complementary assets. Deductive logic and available evidence about
emerging and disruptive technologies suggest that their effects will be
cumulative and this is particularly true for warfare.21 For instance,
machine learning algorithms remain brittle and thus can be easily
neutralized by enemy tactical or operational systems. Similarly, quantum
computing will require major and increasing investments, and its
integration into military forces will require parallel investments.

Technological transition and technology strategy. Third, given the
previous two considerations, **[the challenge for NATO]{.underline}**
will be two-fold: 1) preserve its scientific, technological and
industrial leadership in the so-called Third Industrial Revolution
areas; and 2) consolidate its leadership in the so-called fourth
Industrial Revolution domains. The challenge **[will be]{.underline}** a
**[delicate]{.underline}** one **[to navigate]{.underline}**. A good
number of Allies is dramatically lagging behind in emerging and
disruptive technologies. This **[tech]{.underline}**nology and
industrial **[gap is]{.underline}** already **[creating political
friction]{.underline}** on issues such as taxation of digital
transactions and data regulation. Without a serious attempt to modernize
technologically, **[a two-tiered Alliance could start to take
shape]{.underline}**, and political difficulties will inevitably arise.
In order to understand the challenges ahead, it is useful to look at
NATO's potential competitors.

### L: Unilateral Action

#### The plan's [bolt-from-the-blue]{.underline} nature collapses NATO cohesion- avoiding departures from [incremental planning]{.underline} is key to Biden proving he's not Trump

**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration **[[takes more
cooperative approach to]{.underline}]{.mark}** its first high-level
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** meeting

The Biden administration is preparing to strike a more cooperative tone
at the first meeting of senior NATO officials since President Donald
Trump departed office, as the alliance faces difficult questions about
how to proceed with a frayed U.S.-Taliban peace agreement and when to
withdraw the remaining forces from Afghanistan.

**[[The change]{.mark} in approach]{.underline}** by Washington
**[[comes as the]{.underline}]{.mark}** 72-year-old military
**[[alliance looks to find its footing after]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
tumultuous four years dealing with **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
challenges are vast --- from defending against Russia, evolving to
consider threats posed by China, and extricating forces from Afghanistan
without prompting a collapse of the nation's NATO-backed government and
military force.

Senior U.S. defense officials, in a briefing with reporters, signaled
that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin wouldn't offer any U.S. decisions on
Afghanistan at the virtual two-day NATO meeting for defense ministers
that begins Wednesday, as the Biden administration reviews its policy
ahead of a May 1 deadline for the full withdrawal of U.S. troops set out
in the peace agreement.

The senior officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss
the thinking of Pentagon leaders ahead of the NATO meeting, underscored
that violence must be reduced in Afghanistan and said the Biden
administration was reviewing the peace agreement in particular. One of
the senior officials said the Taliban's compliance with the deal ---
which U.S. officials have criticized --- would be a key part of the
review.

"It will play into how our government comes to a conclusion on where we
should go," one of the senior defense officials said, noting that the
United States looked forward to consulting with NATO allies on the issue
in the days and weeks to come.

The deliberations within the U.S. government over Afghanistan come as
NATO faces an array of challenges, including in Iraq, where a NATO
training and advisory mission, welcomed by the Biden administration, has
continued amid attacks that Iraqi and Western officials have blamed on
Iran-backed militias. On Monday night, coalition forces in Irbil were
struck in an attack that left a civilian contractor dead and a U.S.
service member injured.

Other challenges await: Russia is launching increasingly sophisticated
cyber campaigns, including the most recent SolarWinds hack. Turkey, a
NATO member, is blocking work and picking fights inside the alliance.
And the United States, according to the senior U.S. defense officials,
wants NATO to put China on its priority list.

**[[Most notable]{.underline}]{.mark}** at this week's meeting
**[[is]{.mark} likely to be [the change in style]{.mark} by
the]{.underline}** new **[U.S.]{.underline}** administration toward its
fellow **[NATO]{.underline}** members. Trump often threatened NATO
allies about their defense spending and used a bullying approach that
led some world leaders to mock him and his freewheeling news
conferences. But **[[at NATO, worries]{.mark} about Washington
[extended]{.mark} beyond Trump's tone.]{.underline}**

European diplomats said they would sometimes wake up at 3 a.m. to check
Trump's Twitter feed **[[to]{.underline}]{.mark}** see if he had
announced **[[a sudden shift in U.S.]{.mark} military [posture. They
would spend weeks carefully laying out]{.mark} strategic
[plans]{.mark}]{.underline}** with lower-level U.S. officials, **[[only
to have everything upended by a new pronouncement from the Oval
Office]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Sometimes, U.S. officials would come to
them to try to find ways to work around Trump's anger toward the
alliance.

President **[[Biden]{.mark} has [said he will take a]{.mark} far
[different approach]{.mark} to NATO]{.underline}** and has gone out of
his way to signal support for the alliance, including by recording a
video of a friendly phone call to NATO Secretary General Jens
Stoltenberg last month. After Austin became defense secretary, the
Pentagon scheduled Stoltenberg as his first call, and Biden has already
halted a partial withdrawal of U.S. troops from Germany that Trump
ordered, as the Pentagon evaluates what forces should be stationed
where.

Some four weeks into the new administration, NATO diplomats are still
sorting out the rules of the game inside the glassy alliance
headquarters in Brussels. Trump's ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey
Hutchison, is gone, replaced for now by her former deputy, Chargé
d'Affaires Douglas Jones. Biden has yet to announce his nominee for the
post.

**[One significant shift]{.underline}** so far, diplomats said,
**[is]{.underline}** that the **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}**
administration **[[appears interested in hearing the views of
allies]{.underline}]{.mark}** on issues including operations in
Afghanistan, where in addition to 2,500 U.S. troops, 8,000 forces from
allied and partner nations remain.

Earlier this month, officials from the White House, State Department and
Pentagon joined a conference call with NATO ambassadors, who detailed
their countries' positions on deployments and the security situation. A
number of diplomats said **[it was a departure from
Trump]{.underline}**-era practice --- **[and]{.underline}** that **[they
were delighted]{.underline}**.

Stoltenberg signaled his eagerness to move on from the acrimony of the
Trump era.

"It's no secret that over the last four years, we had some difficult
discussions inside NATO, but now we look to the future," he told
reporters Monday ahead of the defense ministers' meeting. "And **[the
future is]{.underline}** that we now have **[an
administration]{.underline}** in the United States, in Washington, which
is **[strongly committed to]{.underline}** the transatlantic bond, to
**[NATO]{.underline}**, to Europe and North America working together."

**[One of the senior]{.underline}** U.S. **[defense officials
underscored]{.underline}** the point on Tuesday. "**[[Consultation
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** really kind of **[[the name of the
game]{.underline}]{.mark}** here," the official said, describing the
expected tone of the meeting.

### L: AI

#### NATO can't agree on more than [the basics]{.underline} when it comes to emerging tech- pushing the issue exposes divergences that collapse NATO's drive

**Heikkilä, 21** -- Politico Europe correspondent

\[Melissa Heikkilä, \"NATO wants to set AI standards. If only its
members agreed on the basics.,\" Politico, 3-29-21,
https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-ai-artificial-intelligence-standards-priorities/,
accessed 6-4-2022\]

**[NATO wants to set]{.underline}** AI **[standards. If only its members
agreed]{.underline}** on the basics.

**[Big differences over how to treat autonomous weapons could undermine
NATO's drive]{.underline}**.

**[On paper, NATO is the ideal organization]{.underline}** to go about
setting standards for military applications of artificial intelligence.
**[But the widely divergent priorities]{.underline}** and budgets **[of
its 30 members could get in the way]{.underline}**.

The Western military alliance has identified artificial intelligence as
a key technology needed to maintain an edge over adversaries, and it
wants to lead the way in establishing common ground rules for its use.

"We need each other more than ever. No country alone or no continent
alone can compete in this era of great power competition," NATO Deputy
Secretary-General Mircea Geoană, the alliance's second in command, said
in an interview with POLITICO.

The standard-setting effort comes as China is pressing ahead with AI
applications in the military largely free of democratic oversight.

David van Weel, NATO's assistant secretary general for emerging security
challenges, said Beijing\'s lack of concern with the tech\'s ethical
implications has sped along the integration of AI into the military
apparatus.

\"I\'m \... not sure that they\'re having the same debates on principles
of responsible use or they\'re definitely not applying our democratic
values to these technologies," he said.

Meanwhile, the EU --- which has pledged to roll out the world\'s first
binding rules on AI in coming weeks --- is seeking closer collaboration
with Washington to oversee emerging technologies, including artificial
intelligence. But those efforts have been slow in getting off the
ground.

For Geoană, that collaboration will happen at NATO, which is working
closely with the European Union as it prepares AI regulation focusing on
"high risk" applications.

The pitch

NATO does not regulate, but "once NATO sets a standard, it becomes in
terms of defensive security the gold standard in that respective field,"
Geoană said.

The alliance\'s own AI strategy, to be released before the summer, will
identify ways to operate AI systems responsibly, identify military
applications for the technology, and provide a "platform for allies to
test their AI to see whether it\'s up to NATO standards," van Weel said.

The strategy will also set ethical guidelines around how to govern AI
systems, for example by ensuring systems can be shut down by a human at
all times, and to maintain accountability by ensuring a human is
responsible for the actions of AI systems.

"If an adversary would use autonomous AI powered systems in a way that
is not compatible with our values and morals, it would still have
defense implications because we would need to defend and deter against
those systems," van Weel said.

"We need to be aware of that and we need to flag legislators when we
feel that our restrictions are coming into the realm of \[being
detrimental to\] our defense and deterrence," he continued.

**[Mission impossible]{.underline}**?

**[The problem is]{.underline}** that **[NATO\'s members are at very
different stages]{.underline}** when it comes to thinking about AI in
the military context.

The U.S., the world\'s biggest military spender, has prioritized the use
of AI in the defense realm. But **[in Europe, most
countries]{.underline}** --- France and the Netherlands excepting ---
**[barely mention the tech]{.underline}**nology**['s defense and
military implications]{.underline}** in their national AI strategies.

"It's absolutely no surprise that the U.S. had a military AI strategy
before it has a national AI strategy,\" but the Europeans \"did it
exactly the other way around,\" said Ulrike Franke, a senior policy
fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said:

That echoes familiar transatlantic differences --- and previous U.S.
President Donald Trump\'s complaints --- over defense spending, but also
highlights the different approaches to AI regulation more broadly.

The EU\'s AI strategy takes a cautious line, touting itself as
\"human-centric,\" focused on taming corporate excesses and keeping
citizens\' data safe. The U.S., which tends to be light on regulation
and keen on defense, sees things differently.

**[There are]{.underline}** also **[divergences over what
tech]{.underline}**nologies **[the alliance ought to
develop]{.underline}**, including lethal autonomous weapons systems ---
often dubbed "killer robots" --- programmed to identify and destroy
targets without human control.

Powerful NATO members including France, the U.K., and the U.S. have
developed these technologies and oppose a treaty on these weapons, while
others like Belgium and Germany have expressed serious concerns about
the technology.

These weapons systems have also faced fierce public opposition from
civil society and human rights groups, including from United Nations
Secretary-General António Guterres, who in 2018 called for a ban.

Geoană said the alliance has "retained autonomous weapon systems as part
of the interests of NATO." The group hopes that its upcoming
recommendations will allow the ethical use of the technology without
"stifling innovation."

Staying relevant

These issues threaten to hamper NATO\'s standard-setting drive. \"I
think there's a certain danger that if NATO doesn't take this on as a
real challenge, that it may be marginalized by other such efforts,"
Franke said.

She pointed to the U.S.-led AI Partnership for Defense, which consists
of 13 countries from Europe and Asia to collaborate on AI use in the
military context --- a forum which could supplant NATO as the
standard-setting body.

That could have consequences for human rights, too.

"NATO... is a great place to responsibly think about how to harness the
good parts of this technology and how to prohibit the parts that would
be catastrophic for humanitarian law and human rights law, and people at
the end of the day," said Verity Coyle, a senior adviser at Amnesty
International, which is part of the Stop Killer Robots campaign.

"Without oversight mechanisms to ensure ethical standards and measures,
which would guarantee that this technology will operate under meaningful
human control" NATO's strategy could head into an "ethical vacuum,"
Coyle said.

Franke said **[it\'s better for the alliance to focus on the
basics]{.underline}**, like increased data sharing to develop and train
military AI and cooperating on using artificial intelligence in
logistics.

#### AI progress is [incremental]{.underline} now- anything more is divisive

Defence Studies and Analyses

**[NATO's AI Adoption: Challenges and Limitations]{.underline}**

**[The influence of AI on NATO comes with a set of opportunities,
challenges and risks. Its adoption process has been
incremental]{.underline}** and prescriptive. The rising geopolitical
conflicts and the use of AI in such conflicts have required the
establishment of a dynamic ecosystem to support interoperability. The
military adoption of AI requires an innovation ecosystem that is
self-sufficient, supports deterrence and resilience, and encompasses the
strategic innovation process.

NATO's AI strategy raises many concerns related to the AI-driven
autonomous weapon systems, as it does not adequately address the
development of such systems, its deployment and governance. The AI
strategy mostly talks about the ethical and responsible use of AI and
has omitted the challenges related to the use of lethal autonomous
weapon systems. For the US, its priorities lie in ensuring responsible
use of AI-enabled systems with their allies for operational and data
sharing. **[It remains to be seen if all the 30 NATO states agree on the
same rules and would be willing to agree on practical guidelines for the
operational use of AI-enabled systems.]{.underline}**

Another challenge for NATO is to standardise rules for all member states
in dealing with AI-enabled autonomous weapon systems. **[Countries like
Turkey are working on autonomous weapons and have developed AI-enabled
loitering munitions]{.underline}**. Turkey has requested the US for
upgraded F-16 fighter jets that are said to be AI-enabled.25 The Biden
Administration has asked the Congress to approve the upgrade of Turkey's
F-16 fighter jet fleet.26 Turkey's armed drones have also been used in
the Ukraine conflict. For smooth functioning of such systems, it will be
necessary for all NATO members to have standardised rules when it comes
to deployment of such systems.

Also, **[there is no transparent allocation of roles for different NATO
bodies, and "no dedicated line of funding" for its AI
strategy]{.underline}**.27 The finances are shared through multiple
funding like NATO Innovation Fund and DIANA which manages funding for
various other projects leading to uncertainty over availability of funds
and budget cuts. **[This will be a significant challenge for the
effective implementation of the AI strategy]{.underline}**.28 **[Some
other challenges with the adoption of AI strategy through innovation
include fragmented national innovation initiatives, allied technological
categorisation and digitisation gaps, speed of adoption and spending
levels and the underuse of NATO's mechanisms to undertake collaborative
defence innovation]{.underline}**.29

### L: Cyber

#### Any shift from ambiguity causes backlash

**[[Such a shift might face]{.underline}]{.mark}** some initial
**[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly **[[in light of the
Kremlin's history of malicious cyber activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
One of the first state-initiated cyberattacks was perpetrated by Russia
against Estonia, a NATO member, in 2007. In the intervening years,
Moscow has increased its malicious cyber activities, such as the
SolarWinds breach uncovered in December 2020 in which Russia gained
access to a treasure trove of U.S. data. Russian President Vladimir
Putin's maneuvers against NATO members, along with the annexation of
Crimea in 2014, spurred the alliance to adopt a Cyber Defense Pledge in
2016 that recognized cyberspace as a military domain. Two years later,
NATO created a Cyberspace Operations Center in Mons, Belgium to improve
situational awareness and coordinate cyber operations. Since then,
**[[the alliance has consistently reaffirmed the application of Article
5 to cyberspace.]{.mark} At the 2021 summit]{.underline}** in Brussels,
**[[NATO committed to a new]{.mark} Comprehensive [Cyber]{.mark} Defense
[Policy]{.mark}, with allies agreeing to employ the "full range of
capabilities"]{.underline}** at all times **[to]{.underline}** "deter,
defend against, and **[counter]{.underline}** the full spectrum of
**[cyber threats."]{.underline}**

Notably, NATO refined its language with last summer's summit communique
to account for the fact that some cyber incidents may not be
individually decisive, but nevertheless significant when viewed in the
aggregate. Specifically, the allies recognized "the impact of
significant malicious cumulative cyber activities might, in certain
circumstances, be considered as amounting to an armed attack." **[[In
practice, however, NATO leaders have avoided clarifying the conditions
under which a cyberattack would trigger Article 5]{.mark} and how NATO
would respond.]{.underline}** When pressed about Russian cyberattacks in
the Ukraine context, **[Stoltenberg cautioned that, "we have never gone
into the position where we give a]{.underline}** potential **[adversary
the privilege of defining exactly when we trigger Article
5."]{.underline}**

**[This equivocation is not surprising]{.underline}**, for several
reasons. The nature of **[cyberspace]{.underline}** often **[confounds
unequivocal deterrence declarations.]{.underline}** States tend to
operate in cyberspace with plausible deniability, which can make it
difficult to rapidly ascertain responsibility for cyber incidents. Also,
it can be challenging to understand the intent behind observed cyber
behavior, and there is often a substantial time lag between when an
initial penetration of a network occurs and when the target even
realizes the breach. And the vast majority of cyber operations cause
virtual, not physical, damage, complicating efforts to assess and
evaluate the implications of the costs inflicted. Moreover, it can take
time to develop and identify a way to infiltrate a network as well as
the computer code that takes advantage of a vulnerability for malicious
ends. This means states may lack a palatable cyber response option for
retaliatory purposes at the desired time.

#### Refining cyber policy is [hard political work]{.underline} that [takes months]{.underline}

**Lonergan, 22** \-- Army Cyber Institute professor

With little chance of improved NATO-Russian relations any time soon,
time is of the essence to get this right. **[[The allies should begin
the hard political]{.mark} leg[work]{.mark} now to ensure members get on
the same page]{.underline}** before NATO's June summit, if not sooner.
**[[Achieving consensus on significant cyber issues has]{.mark}
previously [taken time. NATO's attribution of the Microsoft]{.mark}

was]{.underline}** an **[important]{.underline}** step for the alliance

March]{.underline}** 2021 **[and the NATO statement was not
made]{.underline}** public **[until July]{.underline}**. In the current
crisis, the alliance will not have the luxury of waiting four (or more)
months to agree on a response. To avoid incurring damaging costs to
NATO's credibility and its deterrent powers, the allies should refine
their cyber policy, now.

### AT Link Turns

#### Ukraine approach is [Goldilocks]{.underline} now- link turns are links

**Smith, 22** \-- Guardian\'s Washington DC bureau chief

\[David, \"Biden seeks to reassure Europe as he walks tightrope over
Ukraine crisis,\" Guardian, 3-24-2022,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/biden-europe-visit-nato-ukraine-crisis,
accessed 6-4-2022\]

**[Biden seeks to reassure Europe as he walks tightrope over Ukraine
crisis]{.underline}**

President reiterated his message to Brussels that America is back, while
he promises to impose sanctions on 300 members of the Russian parliament

He did not shove the prime minister of Montenegro at a photo-op, he did
not call the British prime minister and German chancellor "losers" and
he did not deride Nato as a bunch of grifters looking for a free lunch.

So low was the bar set by former US president Donald Trump that, merely
by condemning Russia's Vladimir Putin rather than gushing over his
biceps, Joe Biden earned good will on his unity and resolve tour of
Europe.

The president came to Brussels on Thursday with promises to accept up to
100,000 Ukrainian refugees fleeing the month-long Russian invasion, give
\$1bn in new humanitarian aid and impose sanctions on 300 members of the
Russian parliament.

It was an attempt to project reassurance that Biden, born during the
second world war, can emulate President Franklin Roosevelt's "great
arsenal of democracy" without stumbling into a third.

But the 79-year-old's handshakes and whispers with France's Emmanuel
Macron and others at the Nato, G7 and European Council summits may put
the seal on the Obama paradox: an American president more popular abroad
than at home.

**[Gallup surveys]{.underline}** conducted before Russia invaded Ukraine
**[showed the image of US leadership making a significant recovery from
the Trump era. "Between 2020 and]{.underline}** 20**[21, American
leadership saw double-digit gains in]{.underline}** 20 of the 27 **[Nato
members]{.underline}** surveyed both years," the polling firm said.

That stands in vivid contrast with Biden's approval rating within the
US, which this week fell to a new low of 40%, according to a Reuters/
Ipsos opinion poll. The survey found that 54% of Americans disapprove of
his job performance as the country struggles with high inflation.

Biden's approval rating matched Trump's at this point in his presidency:
both stood at 40% in mid-March in their second year in office. The
relief of western allies at having America back at the table is unlikely
to be reflected by domestic voters in the midterm elections in November.

That is why Republicans are hammering away at Biden by urging him to do
more for Ukraine though with few specific details and, more loudly and
convincingly to the electorate, by blaming him for soaring gas prices at
home. They intend to prove the old adage that all politics is local.

The point was illustrated on prime time cable news television on
Wednesday night. CNN's Anderson Cooper opened his show with coverage of
the war in Ukraine; Tucker Carlson, on the conservative Fox News
channel, talked instead about supreme court nominee Ketanji Brown
Jackson declining to offer a definition of "woman" during her Senate
confirmation hearing.

CNN's Reliable Sources newsletter noted: "As Cooper showed horrifying
drone footage of the widespread devastation in Mariupol, Carlson showed
his audience a sex-ed type graphic of the female reproductive system."

It observed: "Four weeks after the war commenced, there are signs that
fatigue is setting in. TV news ratings, for instance, have started to
fall back to reality after ballooning early on. And perhaps another sign
is the return of culture idiocy that is once again saturating channels
like Fox and social media feeds."

It is a further reminder to be grateful that Trump no longer has his
finger on the Twitter button -- or the nuclear one. The man who once
posed the biggest threat to global democracy has been replaced in that
role by Putin. Biden beat one and must now thwart the other.

So far **[that has meant a "Goldilocks" approach -- not too hot, not too
cold, not too weak, not too provocative]{.underline}**. This received a
boost on Thursday when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered
a video address to Nato from Kyiv that did not, according to White House
officials, include calls for a no-fly zone or Nato membership, giving
Biden some breathing room.

#### NATO unity now deters Chinese invasion of Taiwan- weakness invites aggression

**Feng, 22** \-- Newsweek contributing editor, Asia

**[[China Is Learning Lessons From West\'s United Response to
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[[China is watching the]{.mark} West\'s [collective
response]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}to Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} is **[learning lessons that [may
change its]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}own **[[calculations as it
seeks]{.mark} to annex [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to
senior officials in Washington and London.

When the threat of economic sanctions failed to deter Vladimir Putin and
the first of Russia\'s 150,000 troops began pouring into Ukrainian
territory on February 24, Taiwan became a trending topic as
**[[observers feared China]{.underline}]{.mark}**\'s President Xi
Jinping **[[would]{.mark} be emboldened to]{.underline}** make good on
his vow to **[[capture the]{.underline}]{.mark}** democratic
**[[island]{.underline}]{.mark}** of 23.5 million people.

**[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as Putin\'s forces failed to achieve
their blitzkrieg goals and the war entered its second week, the thinking
changed. Ukraine\'s leaders remained in Kyiv; its armed forces fought
back and ordinary civilians joined the resistance. **[[A galvanized
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}** and the early effects of the West\'s
unprecedented punishment on Russia\'s economy **[[began to give
China]{.mark} watchers [pause]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Taiwan\'s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu called the Ukrainian resistance an
inspiration for the Taiwanese people. Taipei joined several Asian
governments in imposing export controls on Russia and landed on
Moscow\'s list of \"unfriendly\" countries this week.

**[Russia\'s forces]{.underline}** continue their march toward
Ukraine\'s capital and **[may eventually achieve their military
objectives]{.underline}** even as political goals---regime change and
the submission of its public---remain out of reach.
**[But]{.underline}** the events of **[the past days have already made
China more reluctant to invade Taiwan]{.underline}** than just several
months ago, Avril Haines, the director of national intelligence, told
the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday.

\"The view is both that **[[it is likely to reinforce China\'s
perspective on the seriousness with which we would approach]{.mark} an
infringement on [Taiwan and in the unity]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[[they\'ve seen]{.underline}]{.mark}** between Europe and the United
States, particularly in enacting sanctions,\" she said. \"Not just that
unity, but the impact of those sanctions I think are both things that
are critical to their calculus and something that will be interesting
for us to see how they learn those lessons.\"

In her opening remarks, Haines said China---\"an unparalleled
priority\"---would prefer \"coerced unification that avoids armed
conflict.\" The Chinese government has been working to isolate Taiwan
and undermine its elected leaders for years, she said. \"At the same
time, Beijing is preparing to use military force if it decides this is
necessary.\"

In answer to a similar question, **[[CIA Director]{.underline}]{.mark}**
William **[[Burns said he \"would not
underestimate]{.underline}]{.mark}** President **[Xi and the
[Chinese]{.mark} leadership\'s [determination with regard to Taiwan.\"
However]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Burns said **[[Beijing has been
\"surprised and unsettled]{.mark}\" [by]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
difficulties the Russians have encountered in Ukraine.

\"Everything from **[[the strength of the Western
reaction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, to the way in which Ukrainians have
fiercely resisted,\" he said. \"I think there\'s an impact on the
Chinese calculus with regard to Taiwan.\"

Lt. Gen. Scott Berrier, who heads the Pentagon\'s Defense Intelligence
Agency, told lawmakers at the Russia-focused hearing that Taiwan and
Ukraine were \"two different things completely.\" He then hinted at the
considerable U.S. military presence in Asia.

\"I also believe that our deterrence posture in the Pacific puts a very
different perspective on all of this,\" said Berrier. \"We do know that
\[China\] is watching very, very carefully what happens and how this
plays out.\"

At a similar briefing of the U.K.\'s Foreign Affairs Select Committee on
Monday, **[British Foreign Secretary]{.underline}** Liz
**[Truss]{.underline}** said Beijing \"does not want to associate too
closely\" with Russia\'s new status as a \"global pariah.\" She **[left
little doubt]{.underline}** that **[[NATO was setting a precedent with
its united response and sending a message to China]{.mark} in the
process]{.underline}**.

\"**[[There\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** also the issue of **[[the
importance of showing strength]{.mark} as NATO]{.underline}**,\" Truss
said, \"**[because [the]{.mark} rest of the [world will]{.mark} [be
watching, including China, on how the West continues to
respond]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.\"]{.mark}

\"Of course, **[[if we see a weak NATO, that is likely to embolden
China]{.mark}. So I see a tough policy on Russia and a tough policy on
China as being complementary]{.underline}**,\" she said.

**[[China watches warily]{.mark} as Ukraine makes U.S.,

For China, **[[the speed and severity with which the]{.mark} U.S. and
its [allies sanctioned Russia is a warning sign that could guide]{.mark}
future]{.underline}** economic and **[foreign
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

"This is a very multilateral moment," said Reva Goujon, senior manager
for the China corporate advisory team at Rhodium Group.

Beijing has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion.
China has focused on promoting negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,
and it opposes the economic measures that have been taken against
Russia.

Since taking office last year, President Joe **[[Biden has
pursued]{.mark} a strategy of [restoring relations]{.mark}hips [with
allies to put pressure on Beijing.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The Russian invasion of [**[Ukraine]{.underline}**]{.mark} nearly two
weeks ago [**[showed what those allies can do]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

For China, the speed and severity with which the U.S. and its allies
sanctioned Russia is a warning sign that could guide future economic and
foreign policy.

Chinese officials have increased efforts to buttress their country's
self-reliance since President Donald Trump sanctioned telecommunications
giant Huawei and slapped tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of
Chinese goods.

But Trump did all that singlehandedly --- while simultaneously damaging
ties with Europe and provoking uncertainty among U.S. allies in Asia.

The response to Ukraine has been anything but a go-it-alone move by the
United States.

"**[Given [the success]{.mark} that [the U.S.]{.mark} has [had in
coordinating]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}the financial
**[[sanctions]{.mark} and export controls]{.underline}** not just with
Europe but also with Japan, a key player in tech value chains ---
**[this [is extremely alarming for China]{.mark},"]{.underline}** said
Reva Goujon, senior manager for the China corporate advisory team at
Rhodium Group.

"**[[This is a very multilateral moment]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Goujon
said. "At a high level, you would think China would benefit from \[the
U.S.\] having a big distraction in Europe, but actually \[this\] only
accentuates those policy debates over critical exposure and
vulnerabilities to Chinese supply chains."

From Germany to Japan, many countries have joined the U.S. in freezing
the assets of Russian oligarchs, restricting access of Russia's biggest
banks to the global financial system, and cutting off Russia from
critical technology.

China condemns 'unilateral' sanctions

On Monday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the friendship between
China and Russia is "rock solid."

He pointed specifically to a joint statement between Chinese President
Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, in which
China and Russia described "international relations entering a new era"
and "no limits" to their countries' cooperation.

Beijing has refused to call Russia's attack on Ukraine an invasion.
China has focused on promoting negotiations between Russia and Ukraine,
and it opposes the economic measures that have been taken against
Russia.

China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said it "opposes all illegal
unilateral sanctions." It has not elaborated on how the sanctions
against Russia, which have been imposed by many countries, could be
considered unilateral.

When asked about an "alliance of Western nations" pushing Russia out of
the SWIFT banking network, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin
said last week that "China does not agree with resolving issues with
sanctions, still less unilateral sanctions that lack the basis of
international law," according to an English-language press conference
transcript.

Later in the week, spokesperson Wang reiterated that position in
response to a question about whether Western sanctions on trade with
Russia would affect China.

Sanctions "only create serious difficulties to the economy and
livelihood of relevant countries and further intensify division and
confrontation," he said.

China's Europe balance

Escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China in the last few
years had already accelerated Beijing's efforts to firm up ties with
Europe. The Ukraine war threatens all that.

China's "balancing act" of trying to quietly support Russia while
keeping up relations with Europe is "going to be more and more
difficult. That has consequences for trade links, primarily with the
EU," said Nick Marro, global trade leader at The Economist Intelligence
Unit.

Marro noted that reputational risks rise for China "the more China tries
to fudge its stance on Russia and focus its criticism on NATO and the
U.S."

"China was hoping to use the EU as a way to offset the pressure it was
facing from the U.S.," Marro said. "Right now, Europe sees Russia as an
existential threat."

"Right now the impact for China \[from the sanctions\] really is
secondary," Marro said. "This conflict raises bigger questions around
industrial policy and China's diplomatic relations with the West."

China's big economy

China is dealing with a host of its own economic challenges, from
sluggish consumer demand to a slowdown in its massive property sector.
Politically, Beijing is concerned with stability this year as leaders
are set to meet in the fall to give Xi an unprecedented third term.

That all said, China is more entrenched in the global economy than
Russia is and doesn't have the same vulnerabilities --- to sanctions,
for example --- that Russia has.

Europe relies on Russian oil and natural gas, but Russia is otherwise
small in global terms, with an economy the size of the U.S. state of
Texas.

Because Western trade with China is far greater than it is with Russia,
a full trade war with China "would be quite costly \[for the West\] and
in nobody's interest," said Alexander-Nikolai Sandkamp, a fellow at the
German-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy.

"The West would welcome it if China took a stand against Russia and
joined more actively the Western protests," he said. "Now that China is
remaining relatively neutral, that's probably the best that we can
expect."

The Ukraine war and sanctions will likely lower global gross domestic
product by only 0.2% this year, with a bigger impact in Europe,
according to Tommy Wu, a lead economist at Oxford Economics.

China, Russia and SWIFT

Global finance provides a clear example of the limits on China's ability
to support Russia. Just days after the war began, the U.S. and EU
pledged to remove some Russian banks from SWIFT, the standard interbank
messaging system for financial institutions.

"If all Russian institutions are banned from joining the SWIFT network,
then I think the level of political pressure is very different from what
it is now," said ­­Zhu Ning, professor of finance and deputy dean at the
Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.

"Then any attempt to avoid punishment" would be considered "complicit,"
he said. "Quite tricky for Chinese financial institutions."

The Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank announced last
week it was suspending activities related to Russia and Belarus.

**[Short-lasting Western unity?]{.underline}**

On the other hand, there's also the matter of general political
dysfunction in the United States, where the Democrat and Republican
parties are increasingly unable to work together to achieve even widely
supported domestic goals.

Rhodium Group's Goujon pointed out that the U.S. presidential election
in 2024 poses a risk to how long the unity lasts among U.S. allies.

"I think **[the West is very caught up in the moment, \... this idea
that the U.S.-led liberal order is back]{.underline}**, Germany has
woken up, even Switzerland," she said.

"But there are other countries like Mexico, like India, that we see
embrace the Chinese narrative of the multipolar order more readily," she
said, "and that's where I think **[[China is waiting for the heat of the
war to die."]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[Regardless]{.underline}**, the [**[Biden]{.underline}**]{.mark}
administration **[is [trying hard to unify]{.mark} the world's
[democracies --- and since]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}the

#### Unity deters China Taiwan invasion

**[Int\'l [unity over]{.mark}]{.underline}**
Russia-**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}** war **[[makes China cautious
towards Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**

**[While similarities]{.underline}** between Taiwan and Ukraine
**[cannot be drawn in a linear fashion, strong deductions can be
made]{.underline}** with regard to China\'s behavior toward Taiwan and
the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

China under [**[Xi]{.underline}**]{.mark} Jinping [**[will be cautious
and calibrated]{.underline}**]{.mark} in its behaviour towards Taiwan
**[[after witnessing the]{.mark} international community\'s
[unity]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}and reaction
[**[after]{.underline}**]{.mark} Russia\'s war on
**[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

While similarities between Taiwan and Ukraine cannot be drawn in a
linear fashion, strong deductions can be made with regard to China\'s
behavior toward Taiwan and the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The Ukraine-Russia crisis has put forward the best worst-case scenario
for Chinese President Xi Jinping to calculate their move for their
future plan for Taiwan and could also expect what the international
community can do if someone tries to invade in a peaceful life, analysed
International Forum for Rights and Security (IFFRAS), Canada based
international think tank.

\"**[[For]{.mark} China, and [Xi in particular, the big lessons will be
drawn from a careful reading of the international]{.mark} community\'s
[reaction toward]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}what
[**[Putin]{.underline}**]{.mark} calls Russia\'s \"special military
operation\" aiming to \"demilitarize and de-Nazify Ukraine\" under the
logic that \"Russia cannot feel safe, develop and exist with a constant
threat emanating from the territory of modern Ukraine.\" The outcome has
so far been international condemnation and boycotts of Russia, and the
imposition of economic sanctions by the US and the EU \-- resulting in
Russia becoming a \"pariah\" state, International Forum for Rights and
Security said.

**[[The unity]{.mark} in the international community]{.underline}** in
imposing punitive sanctions on Russia **[[disturbs China\'s]{.mark}
larger geopolitical [plans]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}that there is
a growing united front between the US and Europe \-- with the crisis in
Ukraine bridging the gap, it added.

**[[If this united front strengthens, it will]{.mark} not only be a
debacle for China\'s global ambitions; it will also [have ramifications
for China\'s plans for Taiwan.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Besides, Taiwan will be a much harder bargain for China. At this
juncture, Beijing \-- given its leanings toward Moscow \-- cannot afford
to be caught in the crosshairs of the US and Europe.

Notably, in 2020, **[the]{.underline}** United States,
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**epartment **[[o]{.underline}]{.mark}**f
**[[D]{.underline}]{.mark}**efence **[[said]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
**[[the Chinese military is \"]{.mark}likely [preparing for]{.mark} a
contingency [to unify Taiwan]{.mark} with the mainland [by
force.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Even this year, in January, the Chinese Ambassador to US Qin Gang warned
the US and said that the US could face \"military conflict\" with China
over the status of Taiwan.

**[China\'s recent activities have only fuelled speculation about
China\'s plan to invade Taiwan.]{.underline}**

According to the think-tanker, if this is the case, **[then the
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}**-Russia **[crisis [serves as a litmus
test]{.mark} for China]{.underline}**.

Russian President Vladimir Putin\'s move in Ukraine is important for
Xi\'s next move in Taiwan in two ways:

First, Ukraine considers itself a sovereign nation while Putin adopts a
\"Soviet Union mentality\" similarly, to China\'s \"Middle Kingdom
mentality\" under the \"Chinese dream\" of \"rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation\" through \"reunification with Taiwan.\"

The logic is to get all the foreign territories \"back\" into their
country like Ukraine for Putin and Taiwan for Xi.

And the second one is that both the countries with their respective
leaders are the chieftain of all things under their autocratic political
apparatus.

According to the think tank, the Us has adopted a different approach
towards Russia, as compared to North Korea, Iran, Cuba and Syria. The
country has imposed financial sanctions and restrictions on a majority
of Russian oligarchs and state-owned banking and financial service
providers, as well as Putin and many of his associates, on the asset
control office\'s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons
List.

The US Department of Commerce has targeted Russia\'s oil refining
sector. Furthermore, the Us has also imposed a ban on Russian alcoholic
beverages, seafood and non-industrial diamonds. To counter Russia, the
US even imposed economic sanctions on Belarus which supports Russia. Not
the only US but the EU and Japan have also imposed financial
restrictions on Russia and Belarus.

Russia\'s \"most-favoured-nation\" status was revoked on March 11 by the
US along with its NATO allies, G7 and the EU, this was considered a
major blow to Russia\'s economy.

Notably, the international communities\' reaction toward Russia\'s
military operations carries a strong message for China.

Ukraine-Russia crisis feared the US that there is the possibility that
China could also use the same tactics as Russia and could attack Taiwan.
Responding to the question of whether \"the US would come to Taiwan\'s
defence in the event of an attack by China, Biden in October answered,
\"Yes, we have a commitment to do that.\"

**[[Learning from]{.mark} the [Ukraine]{.mark}-Russia crisis, [China
would be cautious to]{.mark} take any further [steps against
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}**, a think tank reported.

### !: Authoritarianism

#### Taiwan is key to counter Chinese authoritarian expansion

**Feng, 22** \-- Newsweek contributing editor, Asia

\[John Feng, \"Why is Taiwan important to the United States?,\"
Newsweek, 6-3-2022,
https://www.newsweek.com/why-taiwan-important-united-states-china-1712363,
accessed 6-4-2022\]

\"**[One thing is very important on top of these geopolitical or
strategic calculations: Taiwan is a vibrant democracy]{.underline}**,\"
said Professor Yeh-chung Lu, chair of the Department of Diplomacy at
National Chengchi University in Taipei. \"Especially to the U.S. general
public, Taiwan sounds more like an asset than a liability, because we
all belong to this international democratic community.\"

**[Taiwan]{.underline}**, among the top suppliers of semiconductors to
the United States, **[has]{.underline}** also **[become part of Biden\'s
band of \"techno-democracies,\"]{.underline}** Lu says---**[a
multilateral and ideological alliance to counter China\'s digital
authoritarianism]{.underline}**.

Lu believes the American public\'s strong support for Taiwan also comes
from the different ways Taipei and Beijing have responded to the
COVID-19 pandemic.

\"In this China is self-defeating because of Chinese government policy
toward its own people,\" he told Newsweek. \"I\'m not saying Taiwan is
always a role model, but on many fronts, Taiwan is doing better than
China in terms of transparency, etc.\"

Taiwan wasn\'t always a democracy. It was ruled as a one-party state
until, thanks in part to American encouragement, the government accepted
democratic reforms in the 1980s. The Taiwanese public voted in the first
direct presidential election in 1996 which brought about the first
transition of power four years later.

In 2022, Taiwan is a different story, Lu said. \"The fact is the PRC
never ruled Taiwan for one day, so for the general in Taiwan, we are not
very familiar with the CCP, and I believe the supermajority in Taiwan
wouldn\'t like to be ruled by the CCP.\"

Craig Singleton, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of
Democracies, said: \"**[Today\'s geopolitical environment centers around
perceived competition between democracies and autocracies for global
influence, a sentiment that stands at the very core of
the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates\'
bilateral **[relationship with Taiwan]{.underline}**.\"

\"Trade and security-related matters often dominate the conversation
surrounding U.S.-Taiwan relations, but that is not why **[Taiwan
matters]{.underline}** to the United States. It matters **[because the
island nation\'s very existence demonstrates that democracy and
democratic values can thrive]{.underline}** a mere 100 nautical miles
from mainland China, amongst a population that is primarily
Mandarin-speaking,\" he argues.

\"Put differently, the U.S. government and the American people
understand that **[what China fears most is not Taiwan per se, it is
Taiwan\'s democracy.]{.underline}** So, when Americans see China
ratcheting up pressure against the island nation and Beijing issuing
threats to reunify by force, they do not just see a threat to liberty,
they see themselves.\"

President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan would seem to agree. She wrote in
Foreign Affairs last October: \"Emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic,
**[authoritarian regimes are more convinced than ever that their model
of governance is better adapted than democracy to the requirements of
the twenty-first century. This has fueled a contest of ideologies, and
Taiwan lies at the intersection of contending systems.]{.underline}**

\"Vibrantly democratic and Western, yet influenced by a Chinese
civilization and shaped by Asian traditions, **[Taiwan, by virtue
of]{.underline}** both **[its very existence]{.underline}** and its
continued prosperity, **[represents]{.underline}** at once an affront to
the narrative and **[an impediment to the regional ambitions of
the]{.underline}** **[C]{.underline}**hinese **[C]{.underline}**ommunist

### AT No War

#### Diversionary theory and PLA hawks make Taiwan war likely, but not inevitable- credible deterrence is key

**Feng, 22** \-- Newsweek contributing editor, Asia

\[John Feng, \"Will China invade Taiwan?,\" Newsweek, 6-1-2022,
https://www.newsweek.com/china-taiwan-invasion-joe-biden-1711647,
accessed 6-4-2022\]

Christina Chen, an assistant research fellow at the Institute for
National Defense and Security Research, Taiwan\'s top military think
tank, tells Newsweek **[the \"likelihood of a military conflict in the
Taiwan Strait in the near term is getting high.\"]{.underline}**

Chen believes **[Xi will secure]{.underline}** **[a]{.underline}**n
unprecedented **[third term in]{.underline}** office this **[November,
but]{.underline}** says **[the legitimacy of his rule \"will be greatly
challenged\" as a result of an economic downturn, created]{.underline}**
in part **[by Xi\'s]{.underline}** sweeping **[zero-COVID
policy.]{.underline}**

\"This **[mounting internal pressure is pushing Xi and the CCP
leadership to divert internal opposition through more external
aggression]{.underline}**,\" Chen says. \"**[There are signs that China
will escalate and cause conflicts]{.underline}**,\" she notes. This is
the backdrop against which Biden\'s comments should be read.

**[That China will \"go the military route on Taiwan\" isn\'t an
inevitability]{.underline}**, argues Bryce Barros, an analyst with the
Alliance for Securing Democracy, a think tank at the German Marshall
Fund of the United States.

\"**[However]{.underline}**, I do think **[hawks within the CCP and PLA
might become more emboldened to take military action]{.underline}**
against Taiwan in some way as it becomes more apparent that Taiwan will
not peacefully unify,\" he says.

Taiwan\'s public has shown little interest in being governed from
Beijing, and its government has gradually increased the country\'s
defense spending in recent years. Clear commitments from Washington,
like the one given by Biden, may reinforce China\'s belief that the U.S.
plans to foil any military action by Beijing, Barros says.

**[Whether China invades Taiwan will revolve around the central theory
of deterrence, chiefly as it pertains to the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, postwar Asia\'s foremost power. To deter
Beijing from a course of military action, both Taipei and Washington
will need to have a clear understanding of Chinese interests and
motives, and seek to shape China\'s own perceptions of a potential
attack by raising the costs of war.

According to Washington-based defense analyst Gerald Brown, a commitment
to defend Taiwan on paper isn\'t enough---it must be matched by
capabilities.

\"We definitely need to worry about having the capability to beat back a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan, and we must actively ensure we rapidly work
towards this,\" he tells Newsweek.

\"Simultaneously, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is already incredibly
difficult and costly for the PRC, and while U.S. forces are not where
they need to be, a U.S.-Chinese war is something the PRC desperately
wants to avoid if possible,\" says Brown, who advocates \"strategic
clarity\" to reinforce deterrence.

\"Now, having the capability is critical here, but, if the CCP is unsure
that the U.S. would step in and it has no commitment to do so, not
having the proper capability to defend Taiwan plus having room to back
out would actually serve as a far less effective deterrent,\" he says.

\"The CCP may well assume that without a definitive capability to defend
Taiwan and with the lack of a formal commitment allowing room for the
U.S. to maneuver out and not defend Taiwan, if the PRC launched an
attack the U.S. would be compelled to stay out, encouraging Chinese
aggression,\" Brown says.

Notwithstanding Biden\'s pledge to defend Taiwan, the question of
American involvement goes beyond whether Chinese forces can be stopped.
\"It\'s not binary, everything is subjective and exists on a spectrum,\"
Brown argues. \"**[A lot boils down to how the CCP views the
environment.\"]{.underline}**

Therefore, Biden\'s belief that an invasion of Taiwan won\'t be
attempted must first be built on a credible deterrent, which in the
president\'s view appears to include the shared concerns of U.S. allies
and partners, all of which would favor a continuation of the status quo
above conflict.

But **[keeping the peace will]{.underline}** also **[require tactful
diplomacy]{.underline}**. Some fear that **[mixed
messages]{.underline}** from the Biden administration **[could cause
Beijing to miscalculate and trigger a war]{.underline}** many are
seeking to avoid.

### AT US Won't Intervene

#### US would intervene- strategic interests and Biden's comments prove

**Feng, 22** \-- Newsweek contributing editor, Asia

\[John Feng, \"Will U.S. defend Taiwan if China invades? Experts weigh
in,\" Newsweek, 6-1-2022,
https://www.newsweek.com/us-taiwan-china-invasion-1712083, accessed
6-4-2022\]

Ely Ratner, the Pentagon\'s assistant secretary of defense for
Indo-Pacific security affairs, told a House committee hearing in March
that **[the U.S. response]{.underline}** in such a scenario **[would
differ from]{.underline}** how it\'s supporting
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**. \"I\'m confident that some of our closest
partners would be with us in a Taiwan contingency,\" he said.

Last week, while standing beside Prime Minister Fumio Kishida of Japan
at a press conference in Tokyo, **[Biden said the U.S. would become
military involved in the event of a Chinese invasion]{.underline}**,
even though he believed such a move \"will not happen\" and \"will not
be attempted.\"

Although Biden later disagreed, his remarks appeared to break with over
four decades of careful dancing around the question, a deliberate
position known as \"strategic ambiguity,\" in which the U.S. doesn\'t
publicly commit or dismiss the possibility of defending Taiwan
militarily.

The End of Ambiguity?

Taiwan, meanwhile, says it would be ready to fight alone, although it
has asked the U.S. to expedite arms sales as PLA capabilities continue
to grow.

While some may argue otherwise, **[subject matter experts
believe]{.underline}** China already assumed **[America would
intervene]{.underline}**, long before the president\'s apparent slip of
the tongue.

\"For Beijing, Biden\'s remarks may reveal the attitude to the current
\'answer\' to U.S. strategic ambiguity,\" says Hung Tzu-chieh, an
assistant research fellow at the Institute for National Defense and
Security Research, Taiwan\'s top military think tank. \"I don\'t think
Biden\'s remarks will change Beijing\'s strategic thinking, as Beijing
has long considered the possibility of U.S. military intervention.\"

\"For example, China has continued to develop its naval power and
anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities in the Western Pacific over
the past decades. Its purpose is mainly to target the U.S. military,\"
Hung says.

The PLA\'s rapidly developing long-range strike capabilities---both
conventional and nuclear---are unlikely to be used on Taiwan either,
their range already capable of reaching Guam.

According to Su Tzu-yun, an associate researcher at Taipei\'s INDSR
(Institute for National Defense and Security Research), **[the U.S.
approach has changed]{.underline}**. \"President Biden has **[referenced
a commitment to defend Taiwan several times,\"]{.underline}** he says.
\"These are clear strategic signals to deter China\'s military
adventurism.\"

\"\[U.S.\] policy is clear, but its strategy is ambiguous; that is, its
objective of maintaining the \[Taiwan Strait\] status quo is clear, but
its means are flexible,\" Su argues.

America\'s Changing Sentiment Towards Taiwan

**[The defense analyst lists obvious geostrategic reasons for why the
U.S. might want to defend Taiwan]{.underline}**, which sits in the
center of the so-called first island chain that hems in China. **[The
sea lines around Taiwan]{.underline}** are busy,
**[carry]{.underline}**ing **[90 percent of Japan\'s crude
oil]{.underline}** and 76 percent of its liquified natural gas---both
major lifelines for Tokyo, Su says.

**[The Bashi Channel]{.underline}**, a waterway separating Taiwan from
the Philippines to its south, **[is]{.underline}** also **[critical for
the defense of the continental U.S., as Chinese
sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}** **[exiting the
passage]{.underline}** into the Western Pacific **[can
launch]{.underline}** ballistic **[missiles capable of reaching the West
Coast]{.underline}**, Su\'s analysis shows.

Sean King, senior vice president of New York-based Park Strategies,
believes **[Biden\'s comments were sincere]{.underline}**. \"**[He voted
for the]{.underline}** **[T]{.underline}**aiwan
**[R]{.underline}**elations **[A]{.underline}**ct in 1979 **[as a
senator]{.underline}** (so, he clearly understands the issue)
**[and]{.underline}** **[has now said three times]{.underline}** that
**[we\'d defend Taiwan]{.underline}** in case of mainland attack.\"

\"**[It]{.underline}**\'s not a change in U.S. policy but **[does signal
growing American sentiment in Taiwan\'s favor]{.underline}**,\" he said.

#### NATO unity resurgence key to [contain]{.underline} Russia to Ukraine

Republican U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul of Austin is the top House
Republican on foreign affairs and voted to support NATO. On Wednesday,
he sported a blue-and-gold Ukrainian ribbon on his suit jacket at the
Capitol.

He told The Texas Tribune that **[[NATO countries are "stepping
up"]{.mark} in ways some countries had lagged before]{.underline}**. A
frequent conservative critique of NATO is that many European countries
fall short of the expected standard that all member countries spend at
least 2% of their GDP on defense.

"**[NATO is more unified than it's ever been]{.underline}**. Germany now
is putting in 2% of their GDP. And they are sending weapons and they are
training," he said.

NATO bonds further frayed in recent years, as Trump regularly railed
against the alliance. But his criticism did lead to several NATO
countries deciding to increase their defense spending.

**[Everything changed]{.underline}** six weeks ago
**[when]{.underline}** Russian President Vladimir **[Putin
invaded]{.underline}** Ukraine, a country on the Eastern European
frontier that long aspired to join the organization. Several NATO
countries located near Ukraine, like Poland, are most impacted by the
refugee exodus from Ukraine.

Ukraine,\" Daily Beast, 03/03/2022,
<https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-the-west-can-help-ukraine>.

[There is a consensus]{.underline} among Western leaders and strategic
thinkers [about how to [respond to]{.mark} Russia's]{.underline} brutal
and unjustifiable [[aggression against]{.underline}
**[Ukraine]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Unprecedented and sweeping economic
sanctions, moving NATO forces toward its eastern frontiers, and
[[provid]{.mark}ing]{.underline} **[[substantial]{.underline}]{.mark}**
lethal **[[aid]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to Ukraine]{.underline} are the
pillars of this response.

While [this approach may not be]{.underline}
**[sufficient]{.underline}** [to stop Russian forces]{.underline} from
seizing Kyiv, Kharkiv, and other cities, [it has already [aided]{.mark}
Ukraine [in **slowing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [Russian [offensives,
and]{.mark} should be useful in]{.underline}
**[[support]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** [a]{.underline}
**[[protracted]{.underline}]{.mark}** Ukrainian
**[[insurgency]{.underline}]{.mark}** against the Russian occupiers. If
the will to maintain economic pressure on Russia remains strong enough
for long enough, [it could]{.underline} also [[create]{.underline}
**[real incentives]{.underline}**]{.mark} [for Russia [to]{.mark}
negotiate and]{.underline}, perhaps, to [[withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark}.

But in the next few days, [it is]{.underline} already
**[clear]{.underline}** that [[Russia is going to increase]{.mark} its
[pressure]{.mark} on Ukraine]{.underline}. Its
[tactics]{.underline}---which have already included indiscriminate
missile and artillery attacks on civilian centers and the use of
prohibited weapons, including cluster and thermobaric munitions---[will
grow]{.underline} even **[more inhumane]{.underline}**. The civilian
toll will rise. In all likelihood, [it will]{.underline}
**[rise]{.underline}** [greatly]{.underline}.

Vladimir [Putin]{.underline}, frustrated with his progress to date,
sensing what he must do next and anticipating the Western response, has
[prepared the ground for]{.underline} his **[stepped-up
attacks]{.underline}** [[by rattling his]{.underline} **[nuclear
saber]{.underline}**]{.mark}. He has [asserted]{.underline} that
[he]{.underline} has [[put]{.underline}]{.mark} his "defensive" [nuclear
[forces on]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[alert]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
Earlier, he [made [refer]{.mark}ence [to]{.mark}]{.underline} what he
asserted would be the [**[unprecedented]{.underline}**
[costs]{.underline}]{.mark} [should NATO or others step in]{.underline}
to try to stop his invasion of his democratic neighbor.

His goal was to forestall any consideration of NATO putting troops on
the ground to stop him or of introducing any other military efforts to
counter his onslaught, such as air attacks. His warning was effective.
Western leaders have ruled out no-fly-zones or other approaches that
might be both difficult to implement and carry with them the risk of
triggering "World War III" or a devastating nuclear exchange.

So pressure to do more is likely to grow even as the options for doing
more have been severely limited.

Not only does this situation create real, deep conundrums for Western
planners and profound unease for the otherwise brave defenders of
Ukraine, it raises real long-term questions.

Notably, [[if]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[conclusion]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from this war
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[nuclear]{.mark}-armed [states]{.mark}
have the ability to [do]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[whatever they
want]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to]{.underline} their
[neighbors]{.underline}, however cruel and unjustified, because the
risks of fighting back against them are too high, [the [world
will]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[not]{.underline}**
[be]{.underline}]{.mark} [left a safer place]{.underline}.

[Consider]{.underline} for example, [Putin's calculations
regarding]{.underline} **[further]{.underline}** [reconstituting
his]{.underline} warped [vision of a Russian empire if he were to
[feel]{.mark} that NATO's]{.underline} **[[Article 5]{.mark}
guarantees]{.underline}**---that all members will come to the aid of any
member who is attacked---[were]{.underline} actually [just
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[paper tiger]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Would he
[feel]{.underline} that [he could [roll]{.mark} his
[tanks]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[into Latvia]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[without fear of being challenged]{.underline} because so many Western
leaders consider the threat of nuclear war too high to ever challenge
him?

Will NATO---at the moment its renaissance is being celebrated---actually
reveal to its principal adversary that it is not really up to the job
for which it was intended?

These are not easy questions to answer. The [[risks of]{.underline}
**[nuc]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[lear [war are]{.mark}]{.underline}** as
**[[real]{.underline}]{.mark}** as they are ghastly. But [the risks of
[giving]{.mark}]{.underline} all [[the world's Putins]{.mark}
the]{.underline} [**[license]{.underline}** [to run
roughshod]{.underline}]{.mark} [through]{.underline} their
[neighborhoods are]{.underline} also, as history shows,
**[profound]{.underline}**.

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, former National Security Council (NSC)
director for European affairs, said to me, "Western governments are
terrified of Russia's nuclear saber-rattling. We've lost our nerve in
the face of shallow threats."

Tom Nichols, a long-time professor at the U.S. Naval War College and
writer of the "Peacefield" newsletter for The Atlantic, framed the
situation in the following way: "The war in Ukraine is brutal and
horrific. But none of that is an argument for a plunge into the abyss."

But, Nichols cautions, "We are all suffering from the 'CNN effect,'
watching this devastation in real time. It's hard not to be emotional
about it---I am---but a NATO intervention would be the greatest gift
Putin could ask for and risks catastrophic consequences.\"

What options do we have?

Lt. Gen. Doug **[Lute]{.underline}**, former U.S. ambassador to NATO and
former deputy U.S. national security adviser, [recommends]{.underline}:
"[We]{.underline} should [[focus on]{.underline}]{.mark} anti-armor
[Javelins and]{.underline} anti-air [Stinger missiles, getting as many
as possible]{.underline} **[as fast as possible]{.underline}** [into the
hands of Ukrainian forces and]{.underline} **[setting up]{.underline}**
re**[[supply networks]{.underline}]{.mark}** in Poland and Romania [to
sustain the effort]{.underline} over time. These are easy to transport
and distribute, relatively simple to use and have already proven
effective against Russian forces. We [should be]{.underline}
**[stockpiling]{.underline}** these now [and providing]{.underline}
truck [transport that can be]{.underline} **[handed off]{.underline}**
[to Ukrainians]{.underline} at the border. We should take steps to
ensure communications for the Ukrainian regime with secure digital
comms, including satellite access. The ability of the leadership to
communicate is crucial to holding together the military and the civilian
resistance."

Lute [emphasizes]{.underline} that **[[now is the
time]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to take]{.underline} such [actions [while
Russia's attentions are focused]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[away]{.underline}**]{.mark} [from the western part of the
country]{.underline}---the ones that border the EU---[and
where]{.underline} a **[long-term resistance]{.underline}** [is likely
to be based]{.underline}. He also advises that more of [the]{.underline}
[**[private sector]{.underline}** [should]{.underline}]{.mark} [be
[mobilize]{.mark}d]{.underline} (as has happened with recent energy
company and airline efforts to pull out of Russia) and that we continue
to "pay attention to the flanks" by cultivating the engagement and
support of potential new NATO members like Finland and Sweden.

On my Deep State Radio podcast this week, former U.S. Ambassador to
Ukraine Bill [Taylor added]{.underline} that [the [U.S.]{.mark} could
[provide]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more]{.underline}**]{.mark} forms of
technical **[assistance]{.underline}** like helping the Ukrainian Air
Force counter Russian jamming of their radio frequencies, providing
Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) while we still can get such larger
weapons systems into the country, and considering new sanctions like
those targeting Russia's oil sector. (Canada has just announced energy
sector sanctions against Russia.)

But what do we do about the moral hazard associated with caving in to
Putin's nuclear gamesmanship? The former NSC senior director for arms
control and nuclear proliferation in the Obama White House, Jon
Wolfsthal, said: "Putin's threats are designed to shield him from
US/NATO response while he takes conventional action against Ukraine.
While abhorrent, it has been clear all along that we were not going to
commit troops to Ukraine for a variety of reasons, including the risk of
nuclear war (President Biden is 100% right on that). I don't think
\[Putin\] will use nukes, knows it would be suicide, and not clear his
military would support that action."

Wolfsthal continues, "I don't agree that failure to send troops or
'defend' Ukraine adds to the danger that he might roll into a NATO
state. I believe that he is very well-aware that any kinetic move
against NATO territory would trigger a full Article 5 response. This is
one of the reasons he has moved against non-NATO states and why is he so
adamant that Ukraine not join NATO. He knows he would never be able to
reabsorb it into greater mother Russia. His attack has united NATO in a
remarkable way. And it has shown NATO states that they can be strong and
protected without making nuclear threats. And it shows how extreme and
unhinged making nuclear threats are."

Joe Cirincione, a distinguished fellow at the Quincy Institute and
nuclear non-proliferation expert and advocate, observed, "Nuclear
weapons are praised by most theorists as providing stability, as keeping
the peace in Europe. But here we [have Putin using]{.underline}
**[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [as a]{.underline}
**[shield]{.underline}** [to wage conventional war---the kind of
war]{.underline} in Europe [nuclear weapons were]{.underline}
**[supposed]{.underline}** [to prevent]{.underline}."

While he concurs our current strategies are effective and may define the
limits of what we can and should do and while he also does not believe
Putin would attack NATO, after the conflict, Cirincione argues: "After
the war, we will have a brief window to discuss not just what our
policies should be going forward but to examine what went wrong with our
policies in the past. This was not supposed to happen. Either the
invasion or the nuclear risks. So, why did it? What could we have done
better? I think we have to go back to the 1990s and examine our policies
for NATO expansion (Should we have moved so quickly? Could we have
reassured Russia more fully?). But also on the nuclear front."

In a recent article, Cirincione cited a 2007 warning from former
Secretaries of State George Shultz and Henry Kissinger, former Defense
Secretary William Perry, and former Sen. Sam Nunn, that "unless we moved
step by step to reduce and eventually eliminate nuclear weapons, [we
would "be]{.underline} **[compelled]{.underline}** [to [enter
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[new nuclear era]{.underline}**]{.mark} [that
will be [more]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[precarious]{.underline}**]{.mark}, **[psychologically
disorienting]{.underline}**, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} economically
even **[more [costly]{.mark}]{.underline}** [than was Cold War
deterrence]{.underline}."

Cirincione says we are now "in that world." He adds: "If we assume that
there must be a diplomatic termination of this war (it is possible that
it could end with a palace coup against Putin but I wouldn't bet on it),
then we are going to have to offer Putin some face-saving way out. We
are going to have to address his legitimate security concerns (and he
does have some)."

Among the suggestions he favors are, "pulling our 100-150 tactical
nuclear weapons out of Europe in exchange for reduction in his force,
restoring the ban on intermediate-range nuclear weapons that ended when
Trump tore up the INF treaty, getting rid of the pointless missile
interceptors and silos we deployed in Poland and Romania that Putin
fears could be used to house offensive nuclear weapons... getting real
about the 'strategic stability talks' to include immediate, deep
reductions in nuclear forces, making mutual declarations to never use
nuclear weapons first and making that the international nuclear gold
standard all states should follow, \[with\] mutual steps to reduce the
alert levels of nuclear forces by taking them off hair trigger alert and
(as some already do) taking the warheads off of the delivery vehicles."

Lute says, "Before Putin backs down, he will double down." That is
certainly true. But [a]{.underline} **[growing
[consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[if]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} and our allies
**[[maintain]{.underline}]{.mark}** our [[resolve]{.mark}
and]{.underline} our [unity [and]{.mark}]{.underline} by
**[[ratchet]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing **[[up]{.underline}]{.mark}**
existing [[measures]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than taking steps that
risk escalation, in the end [[Putin]{.mark} and the Russians
[will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely have to
**[[withdraw]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from Ukraine [without having

DIANA launch

Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of NATO, announced this week that
the UK and Estonia will host a joint military R&D programme involving
research centres around the alliance. The Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA) is expected to strengthen transatlantic
cooperation on defence technologies and procurement.

**[[The]{.mark} innovation [accelerator will
cover]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}projects in
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, big data, **[[quantum
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies,
**[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, hypersonics and space. "The
goal of DIANA is to support deep technologies companies that contribute
to defence," said Estonian defence minister Kalle Laanet.

In the UK, Imperial College London will be the host organisation,
coordinating what the UK government called "deep tech test centres" for
military technologies, and a "virtual marketplace" to connect start-ups
with investors and procurers.

**[The project is part of a broader NATO initiative to boost military
research cooperation, that will ultimately involve as many as 60
sites.]{.underline}** On 6 April, Denmark's DTU research organisation
said it and partners had been chosen to set up a NATO testing centre in
Copenhagen for quantum technologies. Further announcements on other
sites to be included are expected in coming weeks.

AUKUS cooperation

About the same time as the NATO news, the White House announced on 5
April that US, UK and Australian leaders had agreed to "accelerate
investments to deliver generation-after-next quantum capabilities." The
R&D focus, it said, will be on "positioning, navigation and timing", in
trials over the next three years. Quantum sensors can provide
ultra-precise atomic clocks, to guide ships or missiles.

The AUKUS Quantum Arrangement, as they called it, is part of a broader
defence pact last year among the three nations in response to growing
western concerns about Russia and China. The initial step last year was
an agreement by the US and UK to supply nuclear-powered submarines to
Australia -- undercutting a rival French offer. But the latest
discussions, as the Australian prime minister visited Washington, shows
the three-way alliance widening to include other military technologies.

And separately from the overtly military news, on 5 April Finnish and US
officials signed a joint statement pledging cooperation on a long list
of quantum topics, including research, supply chains, education and
values. The statement focuses on quantum benefits to the economy and
society, and notably excludes mention of defence applications.

What role for Horizon Europe?

But **[[the rapid-fire string of]{.mark} western [announcements signals
a seismic shift in]{.mark} how governments handle the delicate question
of [military]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}versus civilian
**[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The European Commission is planning
to expand the use of research funds for 'dual-use' defence technologies,
but it's unclear whether money from Horizon Europe, its €95.5 billion
programme for civilian research, will actually end up being spent on
developing weapons.

### 2AC: No NATO Unity

#### Post-Ukraine unity is collapsing

**Lucas, 22** \-- Center for European Policy Analysis nonresident fellow

\[Edward Lucas, \"NATO Is Out of Shape and Out of Date,\" Foreign
Policy, 6-7-2022,

**[NATO Is Out of Shape and Out of Date]{.underline}**

**[With the bloc's unity over Ukraine showing cracks, NATO needs an
overhaul.]{.underline}**

Is NATO brain-dead or back in business? Less than three years ago,
French President Emmanuel Macron famously diagnosed "the brain death of
NATO." Rhetoric aside, his point was fair at the time: Europe's dearth
of strategic thinking combined with the unpredictability of U.S. policy
under then-President Donald Trump spelled serious trouble for the Cold
War-era alliance.

Now, **[all talk is of NATO's revival]{.underline}** and resurgence.
Russia's war on Ukraine has given an urgent new relevance to the bloc's
core mission of territorial defense. NATO members appear to have found a
new unity of purpose, supplying Ukraine with weapons, reassessing the
threat from Russia, hiking defense budgets, and bolstering the security
of the alliance's eastern frontier. **[But [the
"honeymoon,"]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}in the words of Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, **[[was brief. As the war drags
on, strains are showing]{.mark}, and the alliance is still
shaky.]{.underline}**

It's true that NATO has come a long way. Only 14 years ago, the
alliance's top-secret threat assessment body, MC 161, was explicitly
prohibited by its political masters from even considering any military
danger from Russia in its scenarios. The pressure came not only from
notorious Russia-huggers such as Germany but also from the United
States, which was eager to keep east-west ties friendly. The Kremlin,
the conventional wisdom insisted, was a partner, not an enemy. As a
result, NATO's most vulnerable members---Poland and the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---remained second-class allies. They were
in the bloc, but only on paper. There were no significant outside forces
on their territory, and the alliance expressly refrained from making
contingency plans to reinforce or even defend them in the event of
attack. Poland demanded such plans and was told that they could be drawn
up to defend the country against an attack by Belarus---but not by
Russia.

Since Russia's first attack on Ukraine in 2014, NATO plans and
deployments have become more serious. There are 1,000-strong tripwire
forces in the three Baltic states and a larger U.S. force in Poland.
Since the start of the invasion in February, that presence has increased
sharply. Moreover, two of the most advanced smaller military powers in
Europe, Finland and Sweden, are banging on the alliance's door. Assuming
objections from Turkey can been smoothed out, they will be members by
year's end. That will fundamentally change the military geography of
northeastern Europe.

Still more important is the stiffening of spines among the members.
Trump's much publicized distaste for NATO was based, in part, on the
European members' chronic underspending. At one point, the exasperated
U.S. leader even tried to present a bill to his German counterpart,
Chancellor Angela Merkel. Now, defense spending is rising across the
alliance. That makes NATO an easier sell in Washington, especially as
the case for U.S. engagement in European security is bolstered by the
war in Ukraine.

Germany, the most notorious laggard, is suddenly splurging money on its
decrepit armed forces---tanks that can't trundle, ships that can't go to
sea, and soldiers who exercise with broomsticks instead of guns. It has
agreed to meet NATO's defense spending benchmark of 2 percent of GDP,
set in 2006 and largely ignored thereafter. The latest country to
announce a big hike in defense spending is Spain, currently lagging at
barely 1 percent of GDP. The prime minister announced that this will
double by 2024. That sets the scene nicely for the NATO summit in the
Spanish capital later this month.

Yet [**[look]{.underline}**]{.mark} a little **[more [closely, and the
picture is far less rosy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Notwithstanding its
apparent unity of purpose since the start of Russia's war, **[NATO looks
out of shape and out of date.]{.underline}** In the run-up to their
summit, **[the [allies have been furiously haggling]{.mark}
over]{.underline}** the **[language]{.underline}** in their new
strategic concept, which will frame the alliance's mission for the
coming years and will be unveiled in Madrid. What will it say about
Russia? About China? What sacrifices and risks are the member states
really willing to accept? Are they willing to pool sovereignty in order
to streamline decision-making?

**[Nothing]{.underline}** in recent weeks **[suggests]{.underline}**
that these **[questions will get clear answers]{.underline}**. For
starters, **[the 30-strong alliance is unwieldy.]{.underline}** In
military terms, only a handful of members matter---above all, the United
States---but in political terms, even little Luxembourg and Iceland get
a voice. Worse, the **[political divides are huge.
[Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}under President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan **[is a semi-authoritarian state that [flirts with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}and fumes at what it considers
European meddling over human rights. [**[Hungary]{.underline}**]{.mark}
under Prime Minister Viktor [Orban]{.mark} **[is]{.underline}** taking a
different but downward path, fusing wealth and power into a new system
of control at home and [**[undermining]{.underline}**]{.mark} U.S. and
European **[[attempts to put pressure on Russia and
China]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Macron's relentless posturing and German
Chancellor Olaf Scholz's foot-dragging create constant obstacles and
distractions. The two leader's weaknesses, on glorious display since the
start of the war, have already enriched the language: Scholzen is a
German neologism for "dither," while makronic in Polish (and its
equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as "vacuous
grandstanding while doing nothing."

Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a big question mark over the alliance's credibility and cohesion.
Any threat or provocation from Russia is unlikely to be clear or
conveniently timed. More likely it will be something deliberately
ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that "accidentally" strays onto the
territory of a front-line state and hits a target. Some countries would
favor a tough response. Others would fear escalation and want dialogue.
Still others would take the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do
nothing. Would the 30---soon to be 32---national representatives in the
North Atlantic Council, the alliance's deliberative body, really make a
speedy and tough decision on how to react? More likely, some of them
would plead for delay, diplomacy, and compromise. Those actually facing
the possibility of attack would be far more hawkish, preferring a sharp
military confrontation to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not one
inch, not one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic
states, speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what they did in
Ukraine."

The **[[political weaknesses are matched by military
ones]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By far the most important country in the
alliance is the United States. The U.S. security guarantee to
Europe---with its threat of devastating conventional and, if necessary,
nuclear response to any attack---is the cornerstone of the alliance.
"All for one and one for all" sounds fine, but **[nobody in the Kremlin
will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch, or Canadian
displeasure]{.underline}**. Yet the result of this is a colossal
dependence on U.S. capabilities, ranging from ammunition and spare parts
(of which European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny) to
military transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over long
distances. Even if Europe's new defense spending plans materialize, they
will not change the fact that only U.S. armed forces can move with the
scale and speed necessary to defend territory from a country like
Russia.

Conversely, the countries that most need defending---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---are the least able to bear the burden themselves. They
need advanced weapons, particularly for air and missile defense, that
they cannot afford themselves. The thin neck of land along the
Polish-Lithuanian border, [**[the]{.underline}**]{.mark} so-called
[**[Suwalki Gap, is particularly vulnerable to
attack]{.underline}**]{.mark} from Russia's militarized Kaliningrad
exclave and Belarus, from which Russia attacked Ukraine. Poland and
Lithuania both want a big U.S. military presence---either a permanent
base or a persistent rotation of forces---to safeguard this strategic
chokepoint.

Yet NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces between the United States and Europe. They rely on
the fiction that the European allies are more or less equal partners.
Even military lightweights need to have important-sounding jobs and
installations, making the North Atlantic Council the military version of
a parliament dividing out the pork.

[**[The]{.underline}**]{.mark} resulting **[[command structure
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** like **[a [tangled]{.mark} pile of
[spaghetti]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In the Baltic region alone, NATO has
several multinational headquarters, one divisional headquarters split
between Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in Poland,
and a corps headquarters at a different location in Poland. Overall
responsibility for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint
Forces Command headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands;
and Norfolk, Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe,
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea
region has yet to be decided---which is just as well, because NATO has
yet to create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance
drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and defense of its
northeastern members, let alone decided who would actually provide the
forces and equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility
is meant to be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy.

A further problem is exercises: NATO does not conduct fully realistic,
large-scale rehearsals of how it would respond to a Russian attack. One
problem is that these are costly and disruptive. Another is that they
expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO members, which can cope with a
carefully scripted exercise but lack the ability to improvise. A third
reason is the fear, in some countries, that practicing war-fighting
would be provocative. Also lacking are detailed plans for fighting a war
against Russia, covering such issues as reinforcing of front-line
states, countering a Russian attack, regaining any temporarily occupied
territory, and---most of all---dealing with a nuclear or other
escalation. As a result, nobody is quite sure how anything would work in
a crisis. Instead, another assumption reigns: that in a crisis, the
United States would take over and do the heavy lifting on all
fronts---logistics, intelligence, and combat.

To be fair, NATO is working on these problems, and all of them are
fixable. But that does not mean that they are anywhere near being fixed.
Wishful thinking remains the alliance's besetting sin.

Worse, **[[NATO is unprepared for]{.mark} the changing nature of [modern
war]{.mark}fare.]{.underline}** Russia's old-style assault on Ukraine is
all too familiar. But the artillery bombardments and missile strikes
that are grinding down Ukraine's defenses are only part of the Kremlin's
arsenal. Its most effective weapons are nonmilitary: subversion,
diplomatic divide-and-rule tactics, economic coercion, corruption, and
propaganda. The most burning current example of nonmilitary warfare is
Russia's weaponizing of hunger. By blocking Ukraine's grain exports,
Russia has raised the specter of famine over millions of people,
including in volatile and fragile countries in North Africa and the
Middle East. Mass starvation is not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but
its consequences include political unrest and mass migration, a direct
threat to Europe. Yet NATO is ill-equipped to deal with this. It cannot
mandate more economical use of grain---for example, by feeding less to
livestock and stopping grain's conversion to fuel. It has no food
stockpiles to release to a hungry world. It cannot build new railways to
ship Ukrainian grain through other routes. Nor can it insure merchant
vessels that might---for a price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea
blockade. NATO has little in-house expertise in countering Russian
disinformation and almost zero influence in African and other countries
susceptible to Kremlin narratives blaming the West for the food
shortages that are already starting now.

NATO could acquire these capabilities. Or it could regain them: During
the Cold War, the alliance had an economic warfare division and ran a
program called the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls to prevent the Soviet bloc from acquiring sensitive
technologies. But in the strategic timeout that followed the collapse of
the Soviet bloc, these agencies and their skill sets shriveled and died.

But as with NATO's military shortcomings, identifying the problems is
not the same as solving them. And given the bloc's unwieldy structure
and issues with key members, it might be wise to lower expectations
about NATO returning to Cold War levels of consistent readiness and
effectiveness. A more realistic vision for the alliance would be to
treat it as a framework for the most capable and threat-aware members to
form coalitions of the willing. These groupings already exist: The
British-led Joint Expeditionary Force, for example, is a 10-country
framework for military cooperation, chiefly aimed at enabling very rapid
deployments to the Nordic-Baltic region in the event of a crisis. France
has a similar venture, the European Intervention Initiative. The five
Nordic states have their own military club, called the Nordic Defence
Cooperation, while Poland has close bilateral ties with Lithuania. A
similar network of bilateral and multilateral ties would greatly
strengthen the alliance's floundering presence in the Black Sea and
other regions, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.
These groupings would not supplant NATO but improve action and
interoperability on top of the alliance's established structures and
mechanisms.

The difficult and underlying question here is the role of the United
States. Europe is, in theory, big and rich enough to manage its own
defense. But its persistent political weakness prevents that. The
paradox is that only U.S. involvement makes NATO credible---yet
overdependence on the United States also undermines the alliance's
credibility, while stoking resentment in France and elsewhere. The task
for Washington is to encourage European allies to shoulder more of the
burden and start thinking strategically again, even as it retains the
superpower involvement that gives the alliance its decisive military
edge. That is entirely doable. But don't expect it to happen in
Madrid---or anytime soon.

**[[Erdogan disrupts NATO unity]{.underline}]{.mark}** amid Putin's
threat to European security

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan negotiates political gains with NATO\'s
expansion

[**[Internal NATO relations have become increasingly strained following
Turkey']{.underline}**s]{.mark} apparent **[[refusal to allow Sweden and
Finland in]{.underline}]{.mark}**to the fold, with fellow NATO member
Greece becoming the latest European nation on Turkish President Tayyip
Erdogan\'s chopping block.

**[Erdogan took a swing at Greek Prime Minister]{.underline}** Kyriakos
**[Mitsotakis]{.underline}** this week when he accused him of attempting
to block a U.S. arms sale of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara.

\"There\'s no longer anyone called Mitsotakis in my book,\" he told
reporters following a Monday cabinet meeting.

The Turkish president also said he would refuse to meet his Greek
counterpart for a previously planned summit later this year.

Erdogan's comments came a week after the Greek prime minister met with
U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill and urged them to consider NATO's
security when making \"defense procurement decisions concerning the
eastern Mediterranean.\"

\"We are always open to dialogue. But there is only one framework we can
use to resolve our differences -- international law and the unwritten
principle of good neighborly relations,\" Mitsotakis told U.S.
lawmakers. \"The last thing that NATO needs at a time when our focus is
on helping Ukraine defeat Russia\'s aggression is another source of
instability on NATO\'s southeastern flank.\"

The Greek prime minister did not mention Erdogan or neighboring Ankara,
but his comments alluded to a long-standing spat with Turkey over
alleged airspace violations.

Turkey and Greece, both of whom are NATO members, have shared a complex
relationship for more than a century. But Athens and Ankara's latest
tiff amid Russia's aggression in Europe could spell trouble for the very
military alliance that Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to
see dismantled.

\"All nations act in their own self-interest, all the time,\" Michael
Ryan, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO,
told Fox News. \"\[Erdogan\] defines the Turkish self-interests and he
defines how they pursue it. And in this case, he views Turkey as a
rising regional power, and he is pushing hard in every direction to
certain Turkish prerogatives.\"

The NATO expert explained that the arms sale merely highlights several
dynamics at play that Erdogan is juggling.

Turkey\'s defenses have been lagging since Washington blocked Ankara
from purchasing U.S. F-35 warplanes in 2019 after it purchased the
Russian-made S-400 missile system.

The White House at the time said, \"The F-35 cannot coexist with a
Russian intelligence-collection platform that will be used to learn
about its advanced capabilities.\"

Turkey is looking to upgrade its air defense systems with modern U.S.
F-16 aircraft not only to bolster its military capabilities amid its
ongoing air disputes with Greece but to aid its operations in Syria.

\"It's a cat and mouse game,\" Ryan said. \"Congress really does have
something that the Turks want.\"

But he added that the \"Turks have something that Congress wants --
which is Sweden, Finland in NATO. That may be Erdogan's play all
along.\"

\"The U.S. can't have Erdogan calling the shots here,\" European policy
expert Nile Gardiner, director of The Heritage Foundation's Margaret
Thatcher Center for Freedom, told Fox News.

\"**[All [NATO allies]{.mark} need to be able to work together. It
[breaks down if you have one or two]{.mark} countries]{.underline}** who
[are]{.mark} **[trying [to derail]{.mark} the future of [the alliance --
which is what Turkey is doing]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" he added.

The Greek prime minister's veiled comments to U.S. lawmakers last week
may have been an attempt to dissuade Washington from securing an arms
sale with Turkey amid its NATO membership blockade.

Russia's war in Ukraine has renewed the weight of NATO's military
alliance, particularly with regard to its Article 5 stipulation that
says an attack on one country will trigger a united response from all 30
member nations.

Sweden and Finland formally requested to join NATO following Russia's
aggression in not only Ukraine but amid threats Moscow has issued
against other European nations.

NATO military commanders championed the move to include Stockholm and
Helsinki in the alliance and said it would bolster NATO defenses and
identify \"vulnerabilities\" in Europe's security.

But Turkey has used the opportunity to block the NATO bids over claims
that Sweden and Finland have housed individuals it considers terrorists.

\"**[[The Turks are undermining NATO by taking this reckless
stance]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Gardiner warned. \"President Erdogan
has a clear choice between either helping NATO or weakening it, and he
needs to be on the right side of history here, instead of appeasing the
Russians.\"

Some foreign policy experts have suggested that **[[Erdogan could be
acting as Putin's \"Trojan horse\" to]{.mark} strategically block NATO's
expansion and [sow turmoil]{.mark} within the alliance.]{.underline}**

But the former defense secretary for Europe and NATO rejected these
claims.

### 2AC: No Taiwan War

**No China-Taiwan war**

**Scobell and Stevenson-Yang, 3-4**

Institute of Peace, March 4, 2022, "China Is Not Russia. Taiwan Is Not
Ukraine."

China Is Not Russia Russia under Putin has repeatedly dispatched its
armed forces for combat missions overseas to a range of countries,
including Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, as well as conducted major
military interventions against other states, most recently Kazakhstan
(albeit at the invitation of that country's president). Moscow has also
actively supported armed groups and militias in some of these same
countries and others. **[Although China has also been active and
assertive in the use of its armed forces beyond its borders in recent
years[, Beijing has eschewed large-scale combat
operations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}Around its periphery, China
has engaged in provocations, confrontations and even violent clashes.
**[[But China, unlike Russia, has refrained from massive interventions,
invasions or occupations of other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** since
it invaded Vietnam in 1979[. **[China's largest deployments of troops
overseas]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the post-Cold War era [have been
on U.N. Peacekeeping missions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Whereas Russia has
more than 20 military installations beyond its borders, to date, China
has only one official military base on foreign soil --- in Djibouti
(established in 2017) --- and a handful of other facilities it does not
formally acknowledge. Of course, Beijing has a history of using its
potent armed forces and muscular coercive apparatus within China's
borders to repress vigorously peaceful protesters, political dissidents
and disaffected ethnic minority peoples. The locations of these
operations include Beijing, Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as Hong Kong.
China has also not hesitated to employ armed force and a wide array of
coercive instruments around its periphery. This includes building roads
and bunkers in remote frontier areas of the high Himalayas along its
contested border with India and constructing artificial islands and
military installations in disputed waters of the South China Sea. In
recent years, China's armed forces have also engaged in deadly clashes
and violent confrontations with Indian army units along the disputed
Line of Actual Control and harassed and rammed the fishing boats and
coast guard vessels of Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries.
Putin appears to relish projecting the image of a strongman who is
routinely willing to thumb his nose at the rest of the world. By
contrast, **[Xi]{.underline}** --- at least to date --- **[has mainly
sought to cultivate a statesmanlike image on the global stage. At times
he has given speeches attempting to cast China as a more responsible,
less meddlesome and values-free version of the United States. And Xi has
invested a lot of time and resources in promoting a set of high-profile
international efforts intended to demonstrate that China is a
constructive and proactive great power.]{.underline}** Employing
positive rhetoric touting "win-win" solutions and aspirations to build a
"community with a shared future for mankind," China under Xi's
leadership has launched ambitious efforts such as the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Putin, by
contrast, has made no real effort to offer an alternative to U.S. global
leadership beyond delivering vague grandiose declarations (often in
tandem with Xi) and has offered the world little in the way of economic
stimulus beyond the prospect of more energy exports and hype about the
Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Despite consisting of only a handful of
Soviet successor states, the EAEU is touted as Russia's answer to
China's BRI. In terms of geostrategic activism, Russia's major
multilateralist initiatives have tended to involve China. These include
the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 and
the formation of the BRICS grouping in 2010. The former is a security
community with a Central Asian focus consisting of Russia, China and
four Central and two South Asian states. The latter is a loose
association of some of the world's largest "emerging economies": Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa. However, Moscow's most
significant geostrategic maneuver under Putin has been to strengthen
Russia's strategic partnership with China. Both Beijing and Moscow
insist that their relationship is not an alliance and their 2001 treaty
of friendship --- which was renewed in 2021 --- does not commit either
signatory to come to the defense of the other in case of military
conflict. Yet, the Sino-Russian relationship is a clearly consequential
alignment that has grown closer in recent years, particularly as their
respective relationships with the United States have deteriorated.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put China in a very uncomfortable
position: Beijing does not want to antagonize Moscow but neither does it
want to damage its relations with Washington and European capitals.
Consequently, China has equivocated in its statements and actions.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for peace but has stopped
short of condemning Russia or calling upon Moscow to withdraw its
military. The lengthy joint statement of February 4, 2022, issued by
Putin and Xi during the Russian leader's visit to Beijing on the eve of
the Winter Olympics, makes no mention at all of Ukraine --- and China
has pointedly abstained on all U.N. Security Council resolutions related
to Russia's invasion. Xi appears to have asked Putin to delay any
military action against Ukraine until after the Olympics. Russia's
invasion poses other difficulties for China both in terms of running
counter to Beijing's long espoused principles in foreign affairs and its
adverse impact on China's national interests in Ukraine. Russia's
actions clearly contradict China's cornerstone foreign policy principles
of noninterference in other countries' affairs and respecting
territorial integrity. Moreover, China has sizable economic investments
in Ukraine and is a good customer of Ukraine's armaments industry. In
2020, Ukraine signed the BRI cooperation agreement, which further
bolstered the economic relationship between the two countries and marked
Ukraine as an important partner in Beijing's signature foreign policy
and economic initiative. Taiwan Is Not Ukraine The fact that Ukraine is
not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was almost
certainly a decisive factor in Putin's calculus to invade Ukraine.
Russia's commander in chief knew that his invading forces would likely
not have to contend with the militaries of any other countries. And if
there were any lingering doubts in the Kremlin about the disposition of
the most powerful member of NATO, U.S. President Joe Biden stated
publicly that the United States would not send military forces to help
defend Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Biden administration has taken strong
steps to reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe and provide robust
military assistance to Ukraine. By contrast, **[[Xi and his Politburo
colleagues have long been convinced that Taiwan has the resolute support
of the world's most capable military. The People's Liberation
Army]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- as all branches of China's armed forces
are known --- **[[continues to assume that if it launches an invasion of
Taiwan, the U.S. military will swiftly and decisively
intervene.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The U.S.-Taiwan relationship, while
technically "unofficial" due to the One China policy, has strengthened
in recent years. On February 28, **[the Biden administration sent an
unofficial delegation of former U.S. defense and national security
officials to Taiwan as a signal to China of that commitment. It remains
true that the greatest deterrence to a massive Chinese military attack
on the island is Beijing's assumption that war with Taiwan also means a
war with the United States.]{.underline}** However, there is no formal
military alliance between the United States and Taiwan. The defense pact
binding Washington to Taipei was formally abrogated in 1979. So why is
Beijing convinced that Washington has an ironclad alliance-like
relationship with Taiwan? There are at least two reasons. First,
successive U.S. administrations have publicly committed themselves to
support Taiwan against Chinese aggression and have regularly sold arms
to the island's armed forces. Second, although there is no language in
the1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) that explicitly commits the United
States to come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack on the
island by China, many in Washington believe that such a commitment
exists. While there are different interpretations as to what the TRA
means, the most significant fact is that the vast majority of U.S.
political and military leaders are fully convinced that this legislation
binds the United States to a de facto alliance with Taiwan. China's
increased military assertiveness and greater level of armed provocations
in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere around China's periphery in recent
years have only served to strengthen the conviction in Washington that
the island is a staunch democratic partner worthy of U.S. support as it
tries to defend tiny Taiwan against efforts by Beijing to coerce the
island into unwanted unification with China. However, Taiwan, unlike
Ukraine, is not a member of the United Nation. While Ukraine has
ambassador-level diplomatic relations with more than 180 countries,
including China and the United States, Taiwan only has full diplomatic
ties with approximately a dozen countries and none of these are major
powers. Yet, thanks to the TRA, Taipei enjoys robust quasi-diplomatic
relations with Washington, and thanks to Taiwan's pragmatic ingenuity,
the island possesses a vibrant worldwide network of de facto diplomatic
missions. Although Ukraine's diplomatic standing is far superior to
Taiwan's, the European country's military alliance status is less
impressive --- Ukraine is not a member of NATO, although it is a very
active member of NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. While Taiwan
also has no formal military allies, the island has several close and
consequential security partners, most notably the United States. China
Is China and Taiwan Is Taiwan Taiwan continues to be the most
contentious issue in U.S.-China relations. Moreover, the Taiwan Strait
is routinely identified as the most plausible location of a military
confrontation between the United States and China. For Xi and his
Politburo colleagues, Taiwan looms large and is prominently identified
as a "core" national interest of China's, with Xi reiterating in 2021
that "resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China's complete
reunification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment of the
Communist Party of China" and that "no one should underestimate the
resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their
national sovereignty and territorial integrity." Moreover, most Chinese
citizens consider Taiwan to be Chinese territory and view the island as
something worth fighting for. Indeed, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
has staked its political legitimacy on the ultimate goal of unifying
Taiwan with China and in the meantime is working resolutely to prevent
the island from becoming de jureindependent. Beijing's preferred means
of realizing unification or preventing independence is peaceful but the
CCP has never renounced the use of armed force. Furthermore, the PLA's
central warfighting scenario is Taiwan and China's military has been
focused on planning and preparing for an operation against the island
for decades. A Cautionary Tale? The above differences notwithstanding,
Russia's combat experience in Ukraine will have a spillover impact on
how China thinks about Taiwan. If the Russian armed forces remain bogged
down in a stalemate in Ukraine for an extended period and/or face a
prolonged and widespread insurgency, this may give Xi and his fellow
Politburo members pause. If Russia's military experiences major setbacks
and perhaps even embarrassing defeats, this may make China's political
leaders think twice about the advisability of an invasion of Taiwan.
After all, an invasion of Ukraine is relatively straightforward --- the
country is geographically contiguous to Russia, sharing an extended land
border with mostly gentle terrain. By contrast, an invasion of the
island of Taiwan is a far more complex operation --- a successful
campaign requires careful planning and coordinated execution between
air, naval and ground forces. It would also involve amphibious landings
in addition to considerable urban warfare --- on an even larger scale
than in Ukraine --- including operations on rugged mountainous terrain.
Certainly, the PLA will carefully study Russia's Ukrainian campaign and
draw lessons from it, much as they have studied campaigns of other major
powers. Such analyses are conducted with great seriousness because
China's armed forces themselves have not fought a major war since 1979
(when Chinese forces invaded Vietnam) and have not conducted a major
island landing campaign since 1950 (against Hainan Island). **[One way
that [China's leadership might be taking notes from Russia's Ukraine
invasion is by rethinking the risks associated with
escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In addition to noting the potential
military embarrassment that Russia is facing[, **[China might be wary of
the sweeping economic sanctions levied by the international community.
If China were to receive similar backlash for an invasion of Taiwan, it
would raise the possibility of truly crippling sanctions at a time when
the Chinese economy is experiencing anemic growth and structural
challenges.]{.underline}**]{.mark} In particular, the weaponization of
the SWIFT payments system might give China pause. Russia has been trying
to popularize a cross-border financial information transmission system,
and China is committed to developing the CIPS payment network, but
neither has had significant success outside Russian or Chinese
borders**[. Despite its flaws, SWIFT remains the most efficient system
for international financial transactions for banks and [being removed
from SWIFT could potentially be devastating to the Chinese
economy.]{.mark} Furthermore, the lessons of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine to date are that the costs of armed aggression are high in blood
and treasure, as well as strong international censure of Moscow and a
resolute collective response by NATO member countries.]{.underline}**

ongoing war. Of broken promises **[[The latest row is between Poland and
Germany]{.mark}, with the former accusing Berlin of reneging on an
agreement to supply Warsaw with new German tanks]{.underline}** as
compensation for Polish deliveries of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine.

Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday accused Germany of breaking an
agreement to supply Warsaw with new tanks as compensation for Polish
deliveries of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, a claim rejected by Berlin.
In April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz introduced \"Ringtausch,\" a
swap scheme under which eastern NATO partners would supply the Ukrainian
army with Soviet-era tanks like the T-72 in exchange for modern western
tanks from German manufacturers, such as the Leopard.

Scholz argued that the arrangement would benefit Ukraine because its
soldiers and mechanics are already familiar with Soviet-era tanks, while
eastern NATO countries receive an upgrade for giving up their tanks.
\"They (the Germans) have not fulfilled this promise. And frankly, we
are very disappointed about this,\" the Polish president told Die Welt
on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.

\"We have provided Ukraine with a large number of tanks ... because we
believe it is our responsibility as a neighbour,\" Duda told the
interviewer. Tanks for Ukraine According to reports, Warsaw passed on at
least 240 Soviet-era tanks to the Ukrainian military. \"By doing so, we
depleted our own military potential and stockpiles,\" he argued. The
German government rejected Duda\'s claims.
\"[**[The]{.underline}**]{.mark} federal **[[government is
flabbergasted]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that\'s how I would put it,\"
government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said Wednesday when asked for a
reaction during a press conference in Berlin.

\"There was a clear request from the Polish side to transfer
state-of-the-art Leopard 2A7 main battle tanks to Poland, but the
problem is that the Bundeswehr itself only has a small number --- about
50 --- of these tanks,\" he said, adding that while \"more are in the
pipeline, they are not standing on a car yard or factory site anywhere;
they have to be manufactured.\" Claims and counterclaims
[**[Sticking]{.underline}**]{.mark} yet
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nother [**[knife in

[**[Scholz]{.underline}**]{.mark} for his refusal to travel to Kyiv. \"I
think he should do that,\" Morawiecki told Die Welt. He added, \"There
is nothing better than visiting the capital of the fighting nation to
realise the seriousness of the situation, to get a sense of the
importance of all that is happening there.\" Scholz has refused to
travel to the Ukrainian capital for the moment, arguing that he had
already gone there 10 days before the Russian invasion started, and
would not go again \"for a quick in and out with a photoshoot\". \"If
\[I go to Kyiv\], then it\'s always about very specific things. And they
have to be prepared,\" Scholz told German television RTL last week.
German officials feel that Poland is trying to profit from its outward
generosity to Kyiv. In lieu of the old Soviet-era tanks they have passed
to Ukraine, the Poles are demanding that Germany recompense it with new,
modern German tanks. The leaders in Warsaw seem to target everyone else
in Europe, to flaunt that they have been at the forefront of the effort
to support Ukraine, while other countries remained laggards. Their
hostility to Putin has resulted in Russia cutting off gas supplies to
Poland after the latter refused to pay for the supplies in rubles as
demanded by Moscow. In frustration, Poland hit out at gas-rich Norway, a
member of the EU and NATO, accusing it of profiteering from the war. On
Sunday, Morawiecki claimed that Norway would earn an extra €100 billion
(\$106.9 billion) from energy sales this year due to a spike in oil and
gas prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine and international sanctions
on Russia, and demanded that the Nordic country share its bounty with
Kyiv, while obliquely suggesting that his country too deserved a share.
Morawiecki argued that Oslo shouldn\'t necessarily send its money to
Poland, but to Ukraine. He even suggested that Polish students lobby
with their Norwegian friends to pressure their country. Not profiteering
says Norway Norway hit back, making it clear that it would not give in
to Poland\'s demand. Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Eivind Vad
Petersson denied that his country was profiteering from the war. He
argued that the excess oil and gas revenues go into the country\'s
pension fund, also known as the Oil Fund, which was established in 1990
to make sure that this wealth serves the current and future generations
of Norwegians. Norway has arguably the best public welfare programme and
social safety net in the world, financed by its hydrocarbon revenues.
But the pension fund has lost 550 billion Norwegian krone (around \$56
billion) due to turbulence in the stock market, Petersson said. In
support of Moscow Elsewhere in Europe, countries like Hungary and Serbia
maintained their countries\' indirect support to Moscow. Hungarian prime
minister Viktor Orban has been a firm supporter of Putin and has refused
flatly to join the sanctions of the West against Russia. He has
categorically refused to abide by the EU sanctions on buying gas and oil
from Russia, arguing that his country just could not do without Russian
fuel supplies. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic echoed Orban\'s line,
declaring on Wednesday that despite pressure from the EU, Belgrade would
pursue its own independent policy. \"Right now, there is no such
possibility,\" Vucic informed Serbian state broadcaster RTS when asked
if Serbia could impose sanctions on Moscow. Serbia has steadfastly
refused to join NATO but has applied for membership in the EU. \"We look
out for our own interests,\" Vucic said. \"Who knows what kind of
threats we may face, but as you see, it\'s been 90 days and Serbia is
standing by its policy, the only country in all of Europe. A small
country with people small in numbers but very proud is following its own
policy -- not pro-Russian, not pro-Western, but its own,\" he pointed
out. \"You now talk about the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but you
didn\'t talk that way 23 years ago,\" Vucic said, referring to the 1999
NATO war that led to the Serbian province of Kosovo becoming independent
thanks to backing from the US and its allies. Threats from Turkey And
worsening yet another headache for the EU, Turkish government spokesman
Ibrahim Kalin said his government would not allow Finland and Sweden
into the NATO alliance until Turkey\'s \"concrete\" security concerns
regarding terrorism and sanctions are met. Kalin\'s remarks came at the
end of five-hour-long talks between delegations from Sweden and Finland
with their Turkish counterparts in Ankara to discuss their joint
applications to join NATO last week. Their admission to NATO needs the
unanimous consent of all 30 member states, and Turkey has threatened to
block the accession process unless the two countries crackdown on groups
it considers terrorists. Turkey has demanded that the two Nordic
countries lift arms export restrictions on Turkey, and extradite
activists of the Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK) and Gulen movement
(FETO) who have sought haven in the two countries. The differences
within the EU that have hobbled its efforts for a unified and aggressive
response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, may come to a head-on May
30 and 31, when the countries\' leaders meet in a summit in Brussels.
Countries express disquiet **[[As the war]{.mark} in Ukraine [shows

[disquiet]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}over the way the West is

**[[Tempers seem to be fraying]{.mark} among the allies
and]{.underline}** the **[verbal exchanges seem to be becoming
rough]{.underline}**, with Ukraine brusquely dismissing a suggestion by
Henry Kissinger that Ukraine\'s borders be set at the pre-invasion
status quo. Ukraine demands that the Russian forces withdraw to the
pre-2014 level. Kissinger\'s suggestion is more in line with the Russian
recognition of the rebel provinces of Donetsk and Lugansk as independent
republics. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kissinger
suggested that Ukraine give up the two provinces to buy lasting peace
with Russia. He said further alienation of Russia might force it to
become a strong and permanent ally of China, endangering global
security. Ukrainian presidential adviser Alexey Arestovich flew off the
handle at the suggestion that Ukraine barter territory for peace with
Russia.

#### Domestic backlash ensures fraying unity the longer the war goes on

**[The West's unity over Ukraine could be starting to crack, just as
Russia's invasion gains ground]{.underline}**

**[Western unity over the war in Ukraine is becoming more vulnerable as
the conflict drags on.]{.underline}**

**[One poll across Europe found a majority of people want an end to the
war as soon as possible, even if it means territorial losses for
Ukraine.]{.underline}**

There is an increasing level of concern among the public in Europe, and
beyond, about rising living costs.

There are increasing signs that **[Western unity]{.underline}** over the
war in Ukraine **[could be starting to crack as the conflict drags on
and leaders face public discontent over rampant inflation and the
cost-of-living crisis.]{.underline}**

There are widespread concerns over how long the war could continue, with
some strategists saying **[it has all the hallmarks of a war of
attrition]{.underline}** where no side "wins" and the losses and damage
inflicted by both sides, over a protracted and prolonged period, are
immense.

The U.S., U.K. and Eastern Europe appear staunch in their position that
Russia must not be able to succeed or "win" in Ukraine by carving out
(or reclaiming, as Moscow sees it) swathes of territory for itself,
saying that could have major global geopolitical repercussions.

They have also been clear that it is Ukraine that must decide if, and
when, it wants to negotiate with Russia over a peace deal. For its part,
Kyiv has said it is willing to conduct talks but that it has red lines,
chiefly, that it is not willing to concede any territory to Russia.

Nonetheless, there appears to be a faction within Europe --- namely
France, Italy and Germany --- that are hoping for a peace deal sooner
rather than later.

On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his officials will have to negotiate with Russia
"at some point."

Macron and his German and Italian counterparts (who are all in Kyiv on
Thursday) have all called for a cease-fire and for a negotiated end to
the war, urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold peace talks
with Zelenskyy, to no avail.

In the meantime, Ukraine continues to plead for more weapons from its
Western allies, with NATO officials meeting this week in Brussels to
discuss Kyiv's urgent need for more arms.

It comes as Russia makes gains in eastern Ukraine largely as a result of
its relentless artillery bombardment of the Donbas. Russian forces are
making slow but steady progress in seizing more parts of the Luhansk and
Donetsk regions where two pro-Russian separatist "republics" are
located, which Moscow is intent on, as it says, "liberating" from
Ukraine.

The West continues to help Ukraine; U.S. President Joe Biden said
Wednesday that his administration will send \$1 billion more in weapons
to Kyiv, as well as another \$225 million in humanitarian aid. For Kyiv,
the weapons can't arrive quickly enough.

But **[questions are now being asked over how long its military
assistance can last]{.underline}**, particularly if the conflict
continues for years.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby was asked on CNN how much Biden is
prepared to spend on Ukraine, given the inflation crisis and economic
pressures the U.S. is facing at home. Data released last Friday showed
the U.S. consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the
highest increase since December 1981, with similarly elevated levels in
Europe (the rate hit a 40-year high of 9% in the U.K. in April).

Saying Ukraine was "a key priority" for the president, Kirby said the
U.S. will "do as much as we can for as long as we can," reiterating that
the latest promise of weapons was just one small part of the larger \$40
billion in aid approved by Congress.

"This is the first tranche announced inside that \$40 billion total
package. So we still have quite a way to go here \... How long can all
that last? How long will the war last? Nobody can be sure," Kirby said.

"We know and predicted that the fight in the Donbas was going to be a
slog, that it was going to probably stretch this war out many months.
And it seems as if that's bearing fruit now."

Western leaders under pressure

When Russia's invasion started on Feb. 24, the West's unified opposition
to the war, and robust response in imposing a raft of tough sanctions
imposed on it, was striking.

**[Four months into the conflict,]{.underline}** however, and **[Western
leaders are increasingly coming under pressure from their electorates as
the fallout from the conflict --- essentially, soaring food and energy
costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and sanctions on Russia
--- hit consumers hard.]{.underline}**

Summing up the dilemma facing officials, Helima Croft, head of global
commodity strategy and MENA research at RBC Capital Markets, said,
"'What is the price you are willing to pay?' has seemingly emerged as
the central question of the summer, as Western leaders seek to balance
their desire to support the Ukrainian resistance with their urgent
imperative to tame inflation and stave off recessions."

There appears to be a geographic dimension to this divide, Croft noted
in her note Wednesday. "U.S., U.K. and eastern European leaders seem to
be the staunchest defenders of the principle that Ukrainians will
determine what constitutes a just peace and have expressed strong
commitments to defending Ukraine's territorial integrity."

However, she said, "officials from continental Europe and many
developing nations, on the other hand, appear more inclined to call for
a compromise that will provide Putin with a 'golden bridge' to retreat
across."

Croft said she had recently attended meetings and policy forums where
"there was an appreciable divide" between those officials calling for
more fulsome military assistance for Ukraine, and "those suggesting that
it is time for Ukraine to consider making concessions at the negotiating
table, citing the ruinous impact of rising commodity prices."

Europeans divided

A pan-European poll released Wednesday also indicated that Europeans'
sense of unity over the war in Ukraine could be starting to wane.

The study by the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank found
an increasing level of concern among the public over the costs of
economic sanctions and the threat of nuclear escalation, in particular.
It was based on polling of more than 8,000 people between April 28 and
May 11 across nine EU countries.

Some 35% of those questioned wanted to see an end to the conflict even
if it meant Ukraine conceding territory to Russia, whereas 22% said they
were more interested in seeing Russia punished for its aggression, even
if it meant prolonging the war.

In addition, a growing number of people said they were worried that
their governments were prioritizing the war ahead of other issues, such
as the cost-of-living crisis.

"Many in Europe want the war to end as soon as possible --- even if it
means territorial losses for Ukraine - and believe that the EU, rather
than the U.S. or China, will be 'worse off' as a result of this
conflict," the report on the poll's findings, co-authored by Mark
Leonard and Ivan Krastev, said.

"Unless something dramatically changes, Europeans will oppose a long and
protracted war. Only in Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Finland is there
substantial public support for boosting military spending."

#### NATO unity crumbling

**Murray, 22** -- The Telegraph

\[Douglas Murray, \"Nato's united front is crumbling now that Putin has
been humiliated in Ukraine,\" Telegraph, 5-23-2022,
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2022/05/23/natos-united-front-crumbling-now-putin-has-humiliated-ukraine/,

**[Nato's united front is crumbling now]{.underline}** that Putin has
been humiliated in Ukraine

**[Western unity will be sorely tested if the conflict turns into a war
of attrition]{.underline}** with no side claiming victory

Aquarter of a year has now passed since Vladimir Putin sent his tanks
into Ukraine. And the first drafts of history have already been written.
Their rough conclusions seem to go along the following lines.

First, to add to Talleyrand's famous phrase, Putin has committed both a
crime and a blunder. The Russian military has shown itself to be corrupt
and inefficient. The Ukrainians have shown themselves to be quite
astonishingly stalwart defenders of their homeland. And the West has
shown itself to be unpredictably united.

Of course, the problem with first drafts of history is that, while they
may be finished with history, history is not finished with them. The
conflict in Ukraine could still go in any number of directions. And
while a Russian victory now looks unlikely, it is not obvious that
Ukraine will emerge with its territory intact. Putin himself may yet act
as dictators can when cornered. And while much of the world moves on, it
is perfectly possible that the invasion of Ukraine becomes a conflict of
attrition which goes on for a long time to come.

Yet it is on the question of the West that I am particularly uncertain
about the first drafts currently circulating.

In some ways it is true that the Western alliances -- especially Nato --
have never looked stronger or more united. For 30 years, we had
discussions of "whither Nato". I took part in many of them myself. Well,
the answer is the one that was staring us in the face all along. Any and
all questions about the point of Nato fell apart the moment the Russian
tanks rolled into Ukraine. The applications for membership from Sweden
and other countries are a fine reminder of that fact. The swiftness with
which the Western banking system and political sanction systems snapped
into place was likewise a rather impressive moment of unity.

And yet, **[for all the talk of the West acting in concert, when it
comes to responding to Putin's aggression, the picture is far more
fractious -- and becoming more so]{.underline}**. As far as I can see,
there are three or four **[factions]{.underline}** within what we might
still call the Western alliance, and their various **[positions appear
to be diverging as the war drags on.]{.underline}**

First are those countries, including the UK, which foresaw Russia's
aggression and acted swiftly to support and arm our Ukrainian allies. It
is this part of the Western alliance which is presenting the world with
a vision of a united front. It is also this part that is most clear in
its view that Putin must be seen to fail because, as President Zelensky
put it yesterday, brute force must not be allowed to rule the world.

But other camps remain. They have not fallen into line behind the likes
of the UK, as some had expected. There are those who are indebted, not
to say compromised, by their recent arrangements with Russia. Despite
its promises of change, the most important country in Europe --
**[Germany -- is still severely compromised]{.underline}**, from the top
of its politics down, **[by decades-long cosying up to Putin. For energy
reasons]{.underline}**, and much more, **[there is still a strong strain
of thought in Berlin which disdains]{.underline}** what the British are
doing in **[Ukraine]{.underline}**.

They would like to go back to the status quo ante, to be able to import
Russian energy cheaply and pass those gains on to German taxpayers, the
better to grandstand about green energy and much more. Their promises of
rearmament have so far come to little. The prolongation of the conflict
has not encouraged them to shift faster away from their prior approach,
but to drag their heels and hope that the old world can be restored.
Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, has hesitated while others have
acted.

Then there is the camp of the Elysée and the president there who
believes that, if he keeps a line open with Putin, he might in some way
solve the conflict. It is understandable that President Zelensky and
others have lost patience with President Macron. For the French leader
has done more than act as a middleman and he has done more than play
both sides. He has dared to give advice to the Ukrainians such as (in a
speech earlier this month) warning them not to give in to "temptation of
humiliation or of the spirit of revenge".

It is easy to sit in Paris and tell Ukrainians not to feel vengeful
towards Russia. The Russians tanks did not roll into the French capital.
Russian troops have not been committing war crimes in French towns and
cities. Nevertheless, Macron seems to be limbering up to play the
negotiating middleman -- the person willing to offer up a portion of
another nation's territory, in a deal which he would never accept were
the territory his own.

What makes all this much more difficult now is that there is a definite
sense -- most especially in Washington -- that an opportunity has arisen
to tie down Russia. This is the final camp. These are people who seem to
see Putin's slip-up as the perfect moment to not just encourage a
Russian defeat but to enable a Kremlin catastrophe, perhaps by miring
its forces in a conflict that they can never win.

A weakened Putin would undeniably have certain advantages. It would be
good if he is no threat for some decades to come. But this theory
forgets. firstly. that a prolonged conflict is easy to wish on people
from thousands of miles away, less agreeable for the citizens of the
Donbas and other regions. It also ignores the other consequences of this
war continuing, including the impact of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian
food exports.

And if the point of this strategy is to somehow push Putin from office,
that is simply not in the West's power, even if it was agreed to be a
desirable objective. Russian history suggests that palace coups do not
always end bloodlessly. The US has a plan for how to get the nukes out
of Pakistan if the Islamists ever take over that country. Does anyone
have a plan for how to secure Russia's nuclear sites if there is a
putsch and internecine war at the top of Russian politics? The people
urging regime change in Moscow ought to hope there is such a plan.

**[So the Western alliance is not as cohesive as we might like to
think]{.underline}**. Yes, we have been shocked by Putin this year. Yes
we have been appalled by his actions. But about the question of what to
do? That remains deeply unclear. **[The West is united in horror. But we
are divided over what to do in its face.]{.underline}**

### 1AR: Accession Thumper

#### Turkey is disrupting NATO unity

**Crowley, 22** \-- NY Times Washington Bureau diplomatic correspondent

\[Michael Crowley and Steven Erlanger, \"For NATO, Turkey Is a
Disruptive Ally,\" NY Times, 5-30-2022,
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/30/us/politics/turkey-nato-russia.html,
accessed 6-19-2022\]

**[For NATO, Turkey Is a Disruptive Ally]{.underline}**

When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatened this month to
block NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, Western officials were
exasperated --- but not shocked.

**[Within an alliance that operates by consensus, the Turkish strongman
has come to be]{.underline}** seen as something of **[a stickup
artist.]{.underline}** In 2009, **[he blocked the appointment of a new
NATO chief from Denmark]{.underline}**, complaining that the country was
too tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and too sympathetic to
"Kurdish terrorists" based in Turkey. It took hours of cajoling by
Western leaders, and a face-to-face promise from President Barack Obama
that NATO would appoint a Turk to a leadership position, to satisfy Mr.
Erdogan.

**[After a rupture in relations between Turkey and Israel]{.underline}**
the next year, Mr. **[Erdogan prevented the alliance from working with
the Jewish state for six years]{.underline}**. A few years later, Mr.
**[Erdogan delayed for months a NATO plan to fortify Eastern European
countries against Russia]{.underline}**, again citing Kurdish militants
and demanding that the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be
terrorists. In 2020, Mr. Erdogan sent a gas-exploration ship backed by
fighter jets close to Greek waters, causing France to send ships in
support of Greece, also a NATO member.

**[Now the Turkish leader is back in the role of
obstructionist]{.underline}**, and is once again invoking the Kurds,
**[as he charges that Sweden and Finland sympathize with the Kurdish
militants he has made his main enemy.]{.underline}**

"These countries have almost become guesthouses for terrorist
organizations," he said this month. "It is not possible for us to be in
favor."

Mr. **[Erdogan's stance is a reminder of a long-festering problem for
NATO]{.underline}**, which currently has 30 members. **[Russia's
invasion of Ukraine may have given the alliance a new sense of mission,
but NATO must still contend with an authoritarian leader willing to use
his leverage to gain political points at home by blocking
consensus]{.underline}** --- at least for a time.

**[It]{.underline}** i**[s a situation that plays to the advantage
of]{.underline}** President Vladimir V. **[Putin]{.underline}** of
Russia, **[who has grown friendlier with]{.underline}** Mr.
**[Erdogan]{.underline}** in recent years. **[For the Russian leader,
the rejection of Swedish and Finnish admission into NATO would be a
significant victory.]{.underline}**

**[The quandary would be simpler were it not for Turkey's importance to
the alliance.]{.underline}** The country joined NATO in 1952 after
aligning with the West against the Soviet Union; **[Turkey gives the
alliance a crucial strategic position]{.underline}** at the intersection
of Europe and Asia, astride both the Middle East and the Black Sea. It
hosts a major U.S. air base where American nuclear weapons are stored,
and Mr. Erdogan has blocked Russian warships headed toward Ukraine.

**[But]{.underline}** under Mr. Erdogan, **[Turkey has increasingly
become a problem to be managed]{.underline}**. As prime minister and
then as president, he has tilted his country away from Europe while
practicing an authoritarian and populist brand of Islamist politics,
especially since a failed coup attempt in 2016.

He has purchased an advanced missile system from Russia that NATO
officials call a threat to their integrated defense systems, and in 2019
he mounted a military incursion to battle Kurds in northern Syria who
were aiding the fight against the Islamic State with U.S. support.

"**[In my four years there, it was]{.underline}** quite **[often 27
against one,"]{.underline}** **[said]{.underline}** Ivo H. **[Daalder, a
U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration, when the
alliance had 28 members.]{.underline}**

**[Europe's effort to stand up to Russia]{.underline}** and Vladimir V.

insisting on the priority of their national interests and playing to
domestic audiences.]{.underline}**

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of **[Turkey]{.underline}** on Wednesday
**[blocked a procedural vote on NATO moving ahead quickly with the
membership applications of Sweden and Finland]{.underline}**, handed in
with much publicity Wednesday morning, a senior European diplomat said.

And Prime Minister Viktor **[Orban of Hungary continues to block even a
watered-down European Union effort to put an embargo on Russian
oil,]{.underline}** part of a sixth package of sanctions aimed at Moscow
for its war against Ukraine.

While NATO and the European Union have shown remarkable unity in their
response to Mr. Putin's **[war, the actions of the two authoritarian
leaders show the strains building as the war drags on]{.underline}**,
peace talks appear to go nowhere, and Western sanctions are contributing
to economic pain and high inflation at home, as well as in Russia.

Mr. **[Erdogan and]{.underline}** Mr. **[Orban may be
outliers]{.underline}** in their organizations, **[but they are able to
use the requirement for consensus in]{.underline}** both
**[NATO]{.underline}** and the European Union to get their political

### 1AR: China Answers

**China does not have the capabilities launch a full-scale war against
Taiwan -- not enough ships, geography prevents, and Taiwan's
infrastructure not sufficient for full-scale attack.**

**Ullman, 2/18** - Senior Advisor at the Atlantic Council

\[Dr. Harlan Ullman, Senior Advisor at the Atlantic Council, February
18, 2022, "Reality Check #10: China will not invade Taiwan,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/reality-check/reality-check-10-china-will-not-invade-taiwan/>,
accessed 4-2-2022\]

Despite Beijing's longstanding desire to invade and conquer Taiwan and
achieve "one China[," **[China simply lacks the military capability and
capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the
foreseeable future.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[With a potential defending
force of 450,000 Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one
ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, to undertake an
invasion, [China would need over 1.2 million soldiers]{.mark} (out of a
total active force of over 2 million[) that would have to be transported
in many thousands of ships.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Although Beijing is
unlikely to launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, given China's
strength, autocratic government, and ambitions, the United States cannot
totally ignore the risk of such an attack. At the same time, however,
Washington should develop an overall strategy designed to deter the most
likely scenarios---such as imposing economic and financial embargoes on
Taiwan, imposing a maritime blockade of the island, or attempting a
regime change from within---or prevail militarily if deterrence fails.
China does have many other options for pressuring Taiwan. What's the
issue? The Trump administration's National Defense Strategy (NDS) was
substantially predicated on preventing two faits accomplis: a Russian
invasion of the Baltics and a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan. To
what degree these scenarios will survive the Biden administration's
soon-to- be-released strategic review remains to be seen. The most
likely outcome is that "integrated deterrence," Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin's term---for now more a slogan than a strategic concept
that attempts a more "wholistic" all-of-government effort---will become
prominent, as will a greater focus on the "deter" element rather than on
"defeat" as was the last NDS. Defining what defeat means and how it
would be achieved remains elusive. Some observers believe that how the
United States handles the Ukraine crisis will be closely watched by
China. That is true. But, as this paper argues, the Ukraine crisis will
not influence Chinese decisions on whether or not to launch a full-scale
amphibious invasion because, given the force demands, China simply lacks
the capacity to do so for the foreseeable future. The current and former
heads of Indo-Pacific Command have warned about China's building the
necessary forces to invade and conquer Taiwan, possibly by decade's end.
Given China's long-standing determination to make Taiwan part of the
mainland and achieve "one China," a military takeover of Taiwan sounds
plausible. **[However, [this notion is based on a fundamental
misperception regarding China's capability to launch a major amphibious
assault]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If China were to launch such a military
attack on Taiwan, what would that take in terms of forces and force
levels? Does China possess the requisite numbers and capabilities? If
not, when, if at all, might it build those forces that, if history
counts, would number in the hundreds of thousands of troops and
thousands of ships and maritime assault vehicles? Current and past
studies do not successfully or specifically address these questions.
These studies focus on the how, but not on the specific manpower
requirements of what would be required to carry out an invasion. The
definitive document on what size force would be required to seize Taiwan
in a full-out landing was drafted by the US military in the late stages
of World War II in the Pacific. In 1944, Operation Causeway was the US
plan for retaking Formosa, as it was then called, from 30,000 starving
Japanese soldiers. The planned invasion force was double the size of
Operation Overlord, the Normandy landing: 400,000 soldiers and marines
deployed on 4,000 ships. With a potential defending force of 450,000
Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers
to defenders taught at war colleges, China would need to deploy over 1.2
million soldiers (out of a total active force of over 2 million). Many
thousands of ships would be required to land all those forces, and doing
so would take weeks. How many occupation forces would be required to
pacify the Taiwanese? Surely the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq are not
lost on the PLA leadership. **[[China possesses a small fraction of the
necessary ships to execute a landing of that size and lacks the capacity
to do so for the foreseeable future. Nor are there any current plans
suggesting China is intent on procuring such a force, though that could
change.]{.mark} Further[, Taiwan is not conducive to any form of
amphibious assault. A handful of landing sites on the west coast are
blocked by proximate mountainous areas]{.mark} running the length of the
250-mile-long island, some approaching 10,000 feet in
height.]{.underline}** Defenders could fall back using this difficult
terrain to wage a guerrilla war. Moreover[, **[Taiwan lacks the
infrastructure to support over a million invaders and their logistical
needs, most of which would have to come from the
mainland.]{.underline}** F]{.mark}ixating on an unlikely scenario, no
matter how compelling it sounds, skews US resources and force levels.

### AT Authoritarianism

**No impact to authoritarianism -- it's media hype**

**Leong '19** \[Ho Wai Clarence Leong holds an MSc from the Columbia
University Graduate School of Journalism and an MA in English and Modern
History from the University of St. Andrews, is the Asia newswire editor

<https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Progress-Watch/2019/0319/In-an-age-of-authoritarianism-the-world-sees-glimmers-of-hope>\]

In the past year, citizens of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Ethiopia have taken to the streets to demand accountability from their
governments, while voters in Malaysia and the Maldives ousted corrupt
governments at the ballot box. [[Countries]{.mark} with a strong civil
society or decent-sized middle class [continue to push back against
autocrats, even though]{.mark} the [headlines are more]{.mark} often
[about]{.mark} the [threats to democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's
not to say democracy has nothing to worry about. A new paper published
this month found that the world has been in "a wave of autocratization"
since 1994, and as many as 75 democracies have seen a reversal to
autocracy. Modern-day autocrats know better than to blatantly shore up
power, but do so gradually and under a legal facade, making it harder to
detect, researchers say. Autocrats pit authoritarianism against
democracy, promoting it as a more efficient form of governance and
spreading the technology that strengthens control. Social media
amplifies the spread of misinformation, clouding voters' judgment.
Global freedom, which is composed of political rights and civil
liberties, has been in decline for the 13th year in a row, according to
[a new report from [Freedom House]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the same
report also [[notes significant improvement in accountability for
corruption in Angola, Armenia, and other nations. Political
participation in most]{.mark} parts [of the world has seen a continuous
upward trend]{.mark}]{.underline}, reports The Economist. And [while
**[autocrats]{.mark}** threaten democracies, they **[are]{.mark}** also
"**[fueling a powerful counterattack]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Human
Rights Watch notes in its latest annual report.
"[[Those]{.underline}]{.mark} who are [[bemoaning]{.mark} this
[authoritarian turn]{.mark} in the world [were overstating]{.mark} the
case]{.underline}," says Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at
Harvard and co-author of "How Democracies Die." [The euphoric expansion
of democracy in the 1990s led to the over-optimistic belief that
authoritarianism was a thing of the past, and now that expectation has
been dashed]{.underline}, he says. [But "there's yet to emerge a real,
viable, truly legitimate alternative to democracy in the
world."]{.underline} That doesn't discount the fact that people are
disillusioned with traditional political parties and losing confidence
in democracy. But [rather than disengaging]{.underline} from it, that
[dissatisfaction is driving citizens to participate in political
processes]{.underline}, according to The Economist. [Voter turnout and
membership of political parties rose, reversing a downward trend. A
larger proportion of the world's population is now willing to engage in
lawful demonstrations]{.underline}. The Economist also notes a
particularly striking area of progress coming from female participation
in politics. "Women have become much more active, not just in \[the\]
U.S. but around the world," says Steven Leslie, lead analyst at The
Economist Intelligence Unit. "[[There is an ongoing surge of female
participation]{.mark} in politics and [in activities]{.mark} that are
[essential to democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Barriers like
discriminatory laws and socioeconomic obstacles are gradually being
removed. In Rwanda and Ethiopia, half of the cabinet ministers are
women. New legislation in Japan encourages gender parity in
parliament]{.underline}. In the United States, the voters in the
November midterms elected the highest number of women to Congress in
history -- though they still make up only 23.7 percent. Still, the
international atmosphere has become less favorable to the expansion of
democracy. Not only is the totalitarian state of China spreading its
influence, but cracks are appearing in decades-old alliances such as the
European Union and NATO. In the EU, both Italy and Turkey saw their
rankings in The Economist's democracy index fall by at least 10 places.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the U.S. is becoming more
isolationist, analysts say. "America's commitment to the global progress
of democracy in its foreign policy has been seriously compromised," says
Sarah Repucci, senior director for research and analysis at Freedom
House. In one example, when the U.S. withdrew from the council on human
rights at the United Nations, it left "a huge vacuum of power," says
Rosa Freedman, a professor of law, conflict, and global development at
the University of Reading in England and author of several books on the
U.N. [Despite the downward trends]{.underline}, however, **[[countries
are forming new alliances to put pressure on repressive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reports [[H]{.mark}uman [R]{.mark}ights
[W]{.mark}atch]{.underline}. It [[points to]{.mark} the example of [the
EU and]{.mark} a group of [Muslim-majority countries working]{.mark}
together to create a mechanism [at the U.N. to collect evidence on the
ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas]{.mark}, which could be used in future
trials of the Myanmar government]{.underline}. A group of [[Latin
American countries led a resolution in the H]{.mark}uman [R]{.mark}ights
[C]{.mark}ouncil [to condemn]{.mark} the severe [persecution of
Venezuelans]{.mark}]{.underline} under President Nicolás Maduro. Other
[[human rights mechanisms have sprung up in unexpected
places]{.underline}]{.mark}, adds Joseph Saunders, deputy program
director at Human Rights Watch. [For example, the organizing bodies of
big sports tournaments, such as the World Cup and the Olympics, will
scrutinize the bidders and hosts' human rights records]{.underline}.
"These are obviously dark times," says Mr. Saunders. "But [\[you\] miss
a large part of the picture if you don't see the pushback that is also
happening]{.underline}."

passes, what distinguishes the approaches of, say, France, Canada and
Ireland, lies in the details. Given how many countries fall into the
non-populist category, true outliers such as Sweden, with its minimal
lockdown, are amazingly few. Compare this with the free-for-all inside
the populist world. Modi has kept the second-largest population on Earth
at home for a month. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, took
measures against the virus relatively early. At the opposite end, there
is the laxity of Trump and Bolsonaro. [**[The crisis has exposed how
little connects these leaders]{.mark}** beyond a surface bonhomie. Some
pretend to be serious about the business of government, some do not. A
club that encompasses them all is likely to be meaningless]{.underline}.
Notice, too, how gaping are its exit doors. By embracing a shutdown,
however tardily, and not talking up a relaxation, Boris Johnson is
viewed ever more as a "normal" leader. At least before his illness, the
UK premier was counted unambiguously among the nativists. Scott
Morrison, the Australian prime minister, after tackling the virus
seriously, has undergone a similar reassignment. The nationalist team
roster has thinned in a few weeks, which tells you how much rigour the
idea ever had. And this is not just about personalities. There are
theoretical contradictions within populism. This is a creed that cannot
decide what it thinks about personal freedom. It resents technocratic
bossiness while brooking no checks and balances in the protection of the
homeland. Trump claims "total authority", yes, but to loosen
restrictions on people, not to tighten them (except for would-be
immigrants). If this tension is evident in one leader, imagine its
permutations for policy across several governments across several
continents across several issues. Even according an "-ism" to such a
disparate bunch is to flatter them. It is understandable that we do. We
are a pattern-recognising species, and sometimes a pattern-inventing
one. It is consoling to detect some kind of shape to the world. But the
point is to not make the pattern itself more frightening than anarchic
reality. No doubt, the [[momentum has been with authoritarians in recent
times. The question is whether they add up to a cohesive front]{.mark}
against democracy]{.underline}. An empire of
[[illiberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, on which the sun never sets,
[[assumes more unity than could feasibly exist]{.mark} among national
egoists]{.underline}. It just took a crisis to show it.

### AT Russia Impact

**No escalation- Putin won't mess with NATO---**invasion is limited

**Dhanesha 2/25** (Neel, reporter for Vox. "How to think about the risk
of nuclear war, according to 3 experts"
<https://www.vox.com/22951004/nuclear-weapons-russia-ukraine-war-putin>
Feb 25, 2022)

The main reason, Bunn said, is that [the United States and]{.underline}
its [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies [have [made it clear]{.mark} that
[they will **not send troops**]{.mark}]{.underline} to Ukraine.
[[Without the threat of]{.mark} military **[intervention]{.mark}**,
[Putin has **little reason** to use]{.mark}]{.underline} his [[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially since Russia has a staggering
numbers advantage over the Ukrainian military.

"[[His objective is not to bring]{.mark} the world to **[nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}," said [Paul
Hare](https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/profile/paul-webster-hare/),
senior lecturer in global studies at Boston University. "[His objective
is to [**simply** swallow Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and restore
not just the \[power of the\] Soviet Union, but the Tsarist empire."

#### No war- NATO backs down

**Gardner 2/23** (Frank, "Russia-Ukraine crisis: How likely is it to
escalate into broader war?"
<https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60485766> Feb. 23, 2022)

Let\'s cut right to the chase here: [[are we witnessing]{.mark} the
prelude to **[World War 3?]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Because let\'s face it, that is what a lot of people are understandably
asking and thinking in the light of the Kremlin\'s recent actions over
Ukraine - actions and statements that have triggered a deluge of
denouncements and sanctions from the West.

**[[No]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [As bad as the situation on the
Russia-[Ukraine]{.mark} border is right now, it [does
not]{.mark}]{.underline} currently [[involve]{.mark} a direct military
[confrontation between Nato and Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In fact, [when [the US]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [Britain]{.mark} watched in
dismay as Russia built up a force capable of invading Ukraine, they
[swiftly pulled out]{.mark}]{.underline} their small number of military
trainers and advisers.
