[Leaders of the [NATO]{.mark} defense alliance]{.underline} Thursday
[said [they were **stepping up
intelligence-sharing**]{.mark}]{.underline} on feared Russian
cyberattacks, [following U.S. warnings that Moscow was preparing
large-scale attacks]{.underline} on NATO countries linked to its
military invasion in Ukraine.

\"[[In preparation for any Russian]{.mark} malicious cyber
[response]{.mark}]{.underline} to the actions we have taken, [[we are
taking steps to increase]{.mark} the **[resilience]{.mark} of the
infrastructure**]{.underline} in our respective nations by
**[[strengthening]{.mark} our coordinated cyber

Thursday.

U.S. President Joe [Biden]{.underline} earlier this week [warned that he
had \"evolving intelligence\" that showed Russia was preparing to
conduct cyberattacks]{.underline} on U.S. infrastructure, urging
organizations in the U.S. to patch their systems in anticipation of
attacks. [Biden\'s message added urgency to repeated calls of
authorities in NATO countries to prepare for cyberattacks.]{.underline}

[[NATO leaders]{.mark} also [said that \"we will continue

Therefore, [the [time and resource requirements]{.mark} to gain access
and develop specific offensive capabilities]{.underline} may
[[render]{.underline}]{.mark} important [[escalatory]{.mark} response
[options]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[infeasible or
impractical]{.underline}**]{.mark} at the desired time. [Operational
planning and execution must consider that a given capability **may
not**]{.underline} be usable or **[even exist]{.underline}** [at a
chosen time of employment.]{.underline}29 As the above discussion
illustrates, [many of the [target]{.mark} sets that would represent
strategic]{.underline} (and therefore [escalatory) targets]{.underline},
[[such as]{.underline}]{.mark} a state's [critical [infrastructure or
nuclear command]{.mark} and control]{.underline}, **[[demand extensive
planning]{.mark}, pre-positioning, and capability
development]{.underline}** [in advance of employing]{.underline}
offensive capabilities. [Therefore]{.underline}, the
[timing]{.underline} of a crisis [plays a crucial role]{.underline} in
decisions about cyber escalation responses. Specifically, [the time
required to develop access to hold strategic targets at risk means that,
even if a [state]{.mark} seeks to escalate]{.underline} against an
adversary [using cyber means, it may find itself [limited by the]{.mark}
[accesses]{.mark} and capabilities [it possesses **at the
moment**]{.mark}]{.underline} a crisis occurs. [Cyber response options
may be limited to **less decisive**]{.underline} or more vulnerable
**[target sets]{.underline}**, [rather than those that are more
strategically significant.]{.underline}

Third, [these limitations become even more salient when we consider how
strategic interactions are likely to play out over time]{.underline}
during repeated crisis interactions. Because [the virtual domain is
changeable in a way that the physical world is not, [actions taken by
defenders]{.mark}]{.underline} in the context of a crisis [[can
**radically and unpredictably**]{.underline} [alter an attacker's
ability to]{.underline}]{.mark} deliver and [[sustain
effects]{.mark}]{.underline} against a target over time.30 [Access and
capabilities are **neither guaranteed nor
indefinite**]{.underline}---they have a shelf life.31 [[Footholds into a
target]{.mark}'s network that were time intensive to
develop]{.underline} **[[can]{.mark} unexpectedly
[disappear]{.mark}]{.underline}** as vulnerabilities in a network are
patched. [Exploits may have a short shelf life]{.underline} as revealing
information about them enables targets to identify indicators of
compromise (IOCs) and use these to prevent further damage from specific
malware strains or quarantine malicious traffic using known malware
signatures. An example of the latter is the US Cyber Command initiative,
beginning in 2018, to share information about adversary malware by
uploading samples to VirusTotal.32 Therefore, [[a target can
"transition]{.mark} from vulnerability (to a particular attack) [to
invulnerability in,]{.mark} **literally,
[minutes]{.mark}**]{.underline}."33 Third-party disclosure about
software vulnerabilities by governments or private actors can also
unintentionally precipitate the loss of access as exposure about
vulnerability information enables network defenders to take measures to
remedy them.34 For instance, the disclosures that began in 2016 by the
group Shadow Brokers of purportedly pilfered US National Security Agency
exploits and zero days ostensibly put US government accesses at risk.35
[Put simply, a vulnerability upon which an access relies may in theory
be only one update]{.underline} or disclosure [away from being
patched]{.underline}.

[Thus, in the context of]{.underline} an ongoing [crisis interaction
between an attacker and defender, the former's operational tempo is
likely to be interrupted by the latter's behavior, forcing the attacker
to devote additional time to find or acquire new
vulnerabilities]{.underline} and exploits in the midst of an offensive
operation or campaign. As Inglis notes, to succeed in an offensive cyber
campaign that unfolds over time, attackers must be able to sustain "the
efficacy of tools under varying conditions caused by the defender's
response and the natural variability and dynamism of cyberspace."36 The
ability to build or acquire new accesses and capabilities "in real time"
during a crisis is highly limited.37 Indeed, General Paul Nakasone
remarked in a January 2019 interview on the radical difference in shelf
life between conventional and cyber capabilities:

Compare the air and cyberspace domains. Weapons like JDAMs \[ Joint
Direct Attack Munitions\] are an important armament for air operations.
How long are those JDAMs good for? Perhaps 5, 10, or 15 years, sometimes
longer given the adversary. When we buy a capability or tool for
cyberspace . . . we rarely get a prolonged use we can measure in years.
Our capabilities rarely last 6 months, let alone 6 years. This is a big
difference in two important domains of future conflict.38

Therefore, as a 2013 Defense Science Board report notes, "[offensive
cyber will always be a **fragile capability**]{.underline}" [when pitted
against network [defenders]{.mark} who are ["**continuously
improving**]{.mark} network defensive tools]{.underline} and
techniques."39

[Each side can take defensive measures to blunt]{.underline} the impact
and [effectiveness of the other's access]{.underline} and
capabilities---particularly as information about them is revealed.
[[Consequently]{.underline}]{.mark}, strategic accesses and capabilities
are likely to become more vulnerable and less reliable over time,
[[shrinking the]{.mark} set of [cyber]{.mark} escalatory response
[options]{.mark}]{.underline} for all parties. This cycle is likely to
generate temporal breaks in the pace of adversarial engagements in
cyberspace, where states must regroup and develop or rebuild accesses
and capabilities during an ongoing interaction. These pauses are likely
to diffuse the pressure that typically accompanies---even
defines---crisis situations, [[creating breathing space]{.mark}
and]{.underline}, by extension, [room [for]{.mark} decisionmakers to
deliberate alternative courses of action, for domestic [political
tensions to cool]{.mark} down, for intent to be
communicated]{.underline} to adversaries, [[and for **de-escalation
pathways to be determined**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

#### It's exaggerated and no escalation

Jasmine **[Rodet 18]{.underline}**, Master's Degree in Cyber Security,
Strategy, and Diplomacy from the University of New South Wales, Cyber
Security Program Manager at Fortescue Metals Group, "The Threat of Cyber
War is Exaggerated", 11/11/2018,
linkedin.com/pulse/threat-cyber-war-exaggerated-jasmine-rodet/

For the regular person on the street, the term 'cyber war' is more
likely to bring to mind the 1983 movie "WarGames" and the [[doomsday
articles]{.underline}]{.mark} that [appear regularly in the media
[about]{.mark} the '[cyber]{.mark} battlefield' and]{.underline} an
[impending World War III]{.underline}. This essay argues that [the
threat of cyber war [is **exaggerated**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} although it can, by definition, be stated that we are
already in a state of cyber war, the impact on states is
**[negligible]{.underline}** compared to conventional war domains. The
argument is presented in 3 steps. The first step is to define cyber war
and cyber weapons, referencing scholars and experts in the area of
conventional war and the cyber domain. The second step is to explore who
has been exaggerating the threat of cyber war and what their motivations
might be. The third is to explore the evidence and quantify the
probability and impact that cyberwar has had on states to date. 'Cyber
war' is a term often used interchangeably in media with cyber-crime,
cyber-attacks, cyber-conflict and cyber-incidents, creating confusion
amongst the public and scholars alike. Clausewitz (1989, 75), in his
book, On War, defines war as 'an act of force to compel the enemy to do
our will'. Rid (2012, 7) on the other interprets Clausewitz use of
'force' as meaning 'violent' force. According to Rid, if an act is not
potentially violent, it is not an act of war. However, Stone (2013, 107)
describes 'cyber war' as a politically motivated act of force, not
necessarily lethal and not necessarily attributable. The definition by
Powers and Jablonski states more simply that cyber war is the
utilisation of digital networks for geopolitical purposes (Nocetti 2016,
464). Neither of the latter two definitions requires violence to qualify
as cyber war. Under these definitions, the Stuxnet cyber-incident in
2010 and the Estonia incident in 2007 would constitute an act of cyber
war, and as such we could say that nations have been at cyber war in the
past and are likely to continue to engage in cyber war in years to come.
For this essay, I will use Stones definition to argue that even though
states may engage in cyber war, the concept of cyber war is exaggerated.
It seems that [cyber war is **deliberately exaggerated** in the media
and by politicians [for **financial** and **political**
gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are countless examples in the media
and in politics of the exaggeration of the threat of cyber war and the
language used plays a big factor in creating a sense of fear in the
community. The Four Corners report, Hacked, is a classic example where
the reporter, Andrew Fowler describes the current situation in Australia
as '... a secret war where the body count is climbing every day' (Fowler
2013). The documentary reveals nothing violent or lethal about cyber
incidents. The documentary is actually about hackers working from
locations overseas, having targeted key Federal Government departments
and major corporations in Australia. In another example, NATO may be
interpreted as exaggerating the threat of Cyber War when they invited
Charlie Millar to present at their Conference for Cyber Conflict at the
NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in 2017. Millar is
an independent security evaluator, and his presentation was titled 'Kim
Jong-il and me: How to build a cyber army to attack the US'. He later
presented similar content at Def Con 2018. His presentation described
the steps he would take to mount a cyber war, including the types of
people he would engage, how much he would pay them, what his strategy
would be and how much it would cost in total. Who stands to gain from
the exaggeration and hype? Logically, [one group would be those that
gain financially from the sale of cyber protective services and
software]{.underline}. According to Valerino, 57% of technical experts
surveyed said that we are currently in a cyber arms race and 43% said
that the worst-case scenarios are inevitable (Valeriano and Ryan 2015).
Translate this into sales and Gartner projects worldwide security
spending will reach \$96 Billion in 2018, up 8 Percent from 2017 and to
top \$113 billion by 2020 (Gartner 2017). Additionally, [there may be
**political motivations** to exaggerate the threat of cyber
war]{.underline}. Cyberspace is not well understood by the general
public and fear is natural. In the US's cyber security debate, observers
have noted there is a tendency for policymakers, [military leaders, and
media]{.underline}, among others, [to use frightening 'cyber-doom
scenarios' when making a case for action on cyber security]{.underline}
(Dunn 2008, 2). There is some evidence to suggest that more recently in
the political arena; we may be maturing in our understanding of the real
threat of cyber war. The Tallinn Manual, an academic, non-binding study
on how international law applies to cyber conflicts and cyber warfare,
was written at the invitation of the Tallinn-based NATO Cooperative
Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. It was first published in 2013 with
the title 'The Tallinn Manual on the International Law of Cyber War'. In
2017, it was re-released with the revised title 'Tallinn Manual 2.0 on
the International Law of Cyber Operations'. The change in title from
'war' to 'operations' signifies a more moderate use of language from
NATO and is an acknowledgement that cyber incidents generally fall below
the threshold at which International Law would declare them to be a
formal act of war. Experience over the 4 short years from 2013 to 2017
has demonstrated that cyber incidents tend to have a low-level impact on
the target state. As the book's authors put it 'the focus of the
original Manual was on the most severe cyber operations, those that
violate the prohibition of the use of force in international relations,
entitle states to exercise the right of self-defence, and/or occur
during armed conflict' while the new version 'adds a legal analysis of
the more common cyber incidents that states encounter on a day-to-day
basis and that fall below the thresholds of the use of force or armed
conflict' (Leetaru 2017). To get a better sense if cyber war is
exaggerated, we must also consider the probability of cyber war in the
future. The probability of cyber war should be weighed up against the
probability of conventional war. Where tensions are already high, for
example, between North Korea and the US or Russia and Estonia, I would
argue that cyber war is more likely than conventional war. This is due
to factors including; cyber warfare is less costly than conventional
warfare, states are less rational in their decision space in the cyber
realm, states find cyber attribution very difficult to achieve so
attacks can be undertaken covertly and cyber war is considered 'a
challenge' and central to the hackers' ethos (Junio 2013, 128). Further,
Sanger describes in his book, The Perfect Weapon, cyber weapons (such as
cyber vandalism, Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS), intrusions and
advanced persistent threat (APT)) as the 'perfect weapons' for the
following reasons; They are cheap: When compared to Nuclear weapons,
there are only a handful of nations globally that can afford the
technology to create a nuclear weapon. They are easily accessible:
Unlike a Nuclear bomb that requires uranium, a highly protected metal,
in the production process, a cyber weapon can be created with minimal
investment and highly available IT infrastructure. They can be
dialled-up or dialled-down relatively easily. A ballistic missile, the
force of the explosion cannot be adjusted as easily as a DDOS attack. A
DDOS attack can be adjusted to last an hour, a few days or a few weeks.
They have a huge range in how they are used: Sabotage as with Stuxnet,
Espionage as with the Chinese industrial spying on the US, North Korea's
infiltration of Sony, the Iranians attack on Las Vegas Sands Corp.
casino operators. The significant factor is that cyber weapons can and
are being used every day for discrete, [[**low-level** cyber]{.mark}
conflicts]{.underline} to undermine and disrupt rivals, but historically
it [[has **not progressed** to]{.mark} open [conflict, nor]{.mark} has
it **[warranted]{.mark}** a **[military response]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Sanger 2018). [Additionally, massive [cyber]{.mark} operations
[would]{.mark} necessarily impact the civilian population and
[violate]{.mark} the [immunity]{.mark} of non-combatants. The conditions
of war dictate that [this is **"taboo"** and]{.mark} to date, rival
[states]{.mark} have **[show]{.mark}n [restraint]{.mark}** in their use
of cyber weapons for this reason]{.underline} (Valeriano and Ryan 2015).
[It appears that [the threat]{.mark} that cyber weapons represent to
national security is overstated and the threat of cyber war [is
**overstated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The US and]{.underline} likely
[other **highly [networked nations]{.mark}** [appear
**reticent**]{.mark}]{.underline} about using cyber weapons for
significant cyber conflict [[given]{.mark} their
**[vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ironically, NSA programs such
as PRISM have made the US more of a target given the sheer volume of
sensitive information stored in one place. Regardless of US defences,
there is no way to make this information completely secure from
intrusion, and as such, the very act of storing the information makes
them more vulnerable. Rid (2012) is among some academics who argue that
[[cyber war]{.underline}]{.mark} has never and [[will]{.mark} likely
**[never eventuate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The benefits of being on this
side of the debate mean that public funding can be allocated away from
offensive cyber security initiatives to other, potentially more
important initiatives, such as public health and housing. The government
is constantly under pressure to prioritise public spending and it is
imperative that they have realistic, accurate projections regarding the
risk of cyber war, the probability and the impact, to allow them to
focus spending on the most important areas.

president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies; \"Dismissing Cyber
Catastrophe,\"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe\]

A catastrophic cyberattack was first predicted in the mid-1990s. Since
then, [predictions of a catastrophe have appeared regularly]{.underline}
and have entered the popular consciousness. [As a **trope**, a cyber
catastrophe captures our]{.underline} [**imagination**, but]{.underline}
as analysis, [it remains **entirely imaginary**]{.underline} [and is of
**dubious value**]{.underline} [as a basis for policymaking. **[There
has never been a catastrophic cyberattack]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[To qualify as a catastrophe, an event must produce damaging mass
effect,]{.underline} including casualties and destruction. The fires
that swept across California last summer were a catastrophe. Covid-19
has been a catastrophe, especially in countries with inadequate
responses. With man-made actions, however, [a [catastrophe is
**hard**]{.mark}**er [to produce]{.mark}** than it may seem, and for
[cyberattacks]{.mark} a catastrophe [requires]{.mark} **organizational**
and]{.underline} **[technical]{.underline}** [[skills most]{.mark}
actors still [do not possess. It requires **planning**]{.mark},
**reconnaissance** to find **vulnerabilities**, [and]{.mark} then
**[acquiring]{.mark}** or building **attack
[tools]{.mark}**]{.underline}---things that require resources and
experience. [To achieve **mass effect**, either a few [central
targets]{.mark}]{.underline} (like an electrical grid) [[need to be hit
or multiple]{.mark} targets]{.underline} would have to be [[hit
simultaneously]{.underline}]{.mark} (as is the case with urban water
systems), [something that is itself [an]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[operational challenge]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

[It is easier to **imagine**]{.underline} [a catastrophe than to produce
it. [The 2003]{.mark} East Coast [blackout is the archetype]{.mark} for
an attack]{.underline} on the U.S. electrical grid. [[No one
died]{.mark} in this blackout, and **[services were restored]{.mark}**
in a few days]{.underline}. As electric production is digitized,
vulnerability increases, but [many **electrical companies**]{.underline}
[have made **cybersecurity**]{.underline} [a priority]{.underline}.
Similarly, [at **water treatment**]{.underline} [plants, the chemicals
used to **purify water**]{.underline} [are controlled in ways that make
mass releases difficult]{.underline}. In any case, [it would take
a]{.underline} **[massive amount]{.underline}** [of chemicals

or]{.underline} [**lakes**, more than most companies keep on hand, and

Moderate and [[measured takes]{.underline}]{.mark} on cyber security

[offering [**hyperbolic perspectives** based on limited

However, [these hyperbolic perspectives are being **[countered

[opposite]{.mark}]{.underline} of what is to be expected. It is
generally observed that limited cyber engagements throughout the
geopolitical system are the dominant form of interaction. Our task here
is to offer a different path forward. We first posit what can be known
about cyber security interactions with data as well as what cannot.
Where is the water\'s edge in cyber security research? We then examine
the known works in the field that utilize data and evidence to examine
cyber security processes. Finally, we conclude with an offering of what
types of studies need to be done in the future to move the field
forward, away from the prognostication and generalizations so typical in
the discourse in this constantly changing and growing field. Keywords
cyber conflict; cyber security; cyber strategy; data collection;
quantitative methods Full Text: 1. The Challenge of Cyber Security
Threat Data Beginning in 2014, various news organizations began
reporting on a particular cyber security firm, Norse Corporation, and
their active cyber threat map (Walker, 2015). Mashable noted in 2016
that \"the global cyber war is raging on, and this mesmerizing map shows
just how serious it has become\" (Gallucci, 2016). The map is dynamic,
colorful, and gets the point across quickly, a criterion for any decent
visualization of data. As late of August 2017, the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA) tweeted out a link and photo of the threat maps suggesting
it represented ongoing cyber-attacks (DIA, 2017). Yet this map is not a
very clear representation of any real threats that nationstates face on
a daily basis. Unfortunately, the Norse cyber threat map does not
represent active threat data, but attacks, likely by bots, on preset
honeypots. Honeypots are a method of providing data on fake targets to
either distract the opposition from the real targets or to deter an
aggressor from attacking in the first place (Gartzke & Lindsay, 2015).
While sometimes a useful method to gather threat intelligence if
presented a sleight of hand for an attractive target, honeypots as
reported in popular discourse are not exactly an accurate representation
of the cyber threat landscape. In this case, the goal was to demonstrate
the ability to track global attacks to gain interest in the company and
promote its capabilities. [Nearly [all]{.mark} active threat
[maps]{.mark} either [present]{.mark} data tracking honeypots and
various bot networks that are devoid of human agency]{.underline},
simply [presenting **what is in fact [fake data]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Active representation of the threat landscape is the goal, but the
reality is that the picture of the cyber security threat landscape we
currently have is incomplete, misleading, or outright fake. High profile
data breaches have been consuming media narratives for at least a
decade. With each act of cyber disruption or espionage, pundits as well
as government officials and several academics declare that cyberwar-fare
is upon us, is the future of warfare, and it is only a matter of time
before a \"Cyber Pearl Harbor\" wreaks havoc on the American homeland
(Gurdus, 2016). With this new revolution in military affairs, the
battlefield, according to some, is forever changed and the next big war
could very well be a cyberwar (Clarke & Knake, 2010; Kello, 2013).
[**Politicians**, **[pundits]{.mark}**, and
**practitioners**]{.underline} have [[jumped on]{.mark} **this [doomsday
narrative]{.mark}**]{.underline} and have promoted cyber arms races,
offensive advantage, and deterrence strategies to stay one step ahead of
would be adversaries in order to prevent them from infiltrating networks
out of fear of massive retaliation. These revolutionists point to acts
such as Stuxnet, Shamoon, Sony, and the Office of Personal Management
(OPM) hack as the new norm of conflict between states, and that the US
is losing ground with every tolerated cyber-attack on American networks.

Unfortunately, [the **Hollywood-esque idea** of [a **country-wide
blackout**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that grinds society to a halt [is what
many]{.mark} people [consider]{.mark} to be the [reality]{.mark} of the
threat to the electric grid system]{.underline}. [But the truth is
**less of a blockbuster**]{.underline}.

Consider this:

[[A destructive incident at **one** site would require **highly-tailored
tools**]{.mark} **and operations** [and **would not**]{.mark}
**effectively [scale]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[A **ransomware infection**]{.mark} at the financial services division
of an electric utility **[doesn't]{.mark} automatically [translate into
a blackout]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[In most industrial environments the [equipment]{.mark} [can operate
**safely** and **independently**]{.mark} for **quite a while**,
[so]{.mark} system [downtime may have **no
effect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It could however hurt business operations
like shipping, sales, etc.

So why is it important to identify fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) in
reporting? It can have a real impact on how people do their jobs: if
incidents relating to ICS security are misreported it can be a headache
for defenders and owners and operators who may not have the proper
context. Additionally, it contributes to an overall misunderstanding
among the general public and policy makers who often make decisions
based on public information.

It's worth noting [the phrase "**[hacking the grid]{.mark}**" **[doesn't
make]{.mark} complete [sense]{.mark}**.]{.underline} At a very basic
level, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [North American Electric [grid is
**complex**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and made up of **regional and
local**]{.mark} **electricity [grids]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are

**New grid tech solves resilience vs cyber**

[[A new]{.mark} partnership between a pioneer]{.underline} in
superconductor [[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology [and]{.underline} the
[Chicago utility [has hatched a new solution for keeping]{.mark} the
[heat pumping]{.mark}]{.underline} and factories chugging [[if anything
were to knock]{.mark} out]{.underline} parts of
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} city's [[grid]{.mark}. American
Superconductor]{.underline} (AMSC), a Nasdaq-listed innovator in energy
technology, [is deploying its Resilient Electric Grid ([REG)
system]{.mark} at two substations]{.underline} operated by ComEd, the
utility serving over 4 million homes and businesses in Chicago and
northern Illinois. If this first installation performs as the city
expects, [Chicago could expand the technology to [link many]{.mark} more
of the [nodes]{.mark}]{.underline} that distribute electricity directly
to homes and businesses. "We're planning this stage with the next stage
of connecting multiple substations in mind," says Terence Donnelly,
president and COO of ComEd. Put simply, [REG is a backup system that for
the first time connects substations so that if a downtown facility is
damaged by]{.underline} severe weather or a massive [hack, a nearby
station it's linked to sends power]{.underline} to the offices and
apartment buildings that would otherwise suffer a blackout.

[The REG technology [offers a]{.mark} second [big advantage. It
could]{.mark} create a [fully integrated]{.mark} network where when one
substation needs extra power, others]{.underline} that [[harbor
additional capacity]{.mark} can fill the gap. Hence, utilities would no
longer need to build each individual station]{.underline} so that it
holds tons of excess capacity for times when AC units or heaters are
running at full tilt, or when part of its equipment fails. "**[[REG
changes the whole]{.mark} geography of the
[grid]{.mark},"]{.underline}** says Daniel McGahn, AMSC's chief
executive. "[The more you network the grid**, the less excess capacity
you need.** The utilities no longer have to keep building new
substations]{.underline} to meet higher usage, they can tap the
'trapped' capacity from the substations already there."

The way the grid operates now, its nodes can't back each other up in
times of trouble

To grasp the potential impact of the REG system, it's important to
understand why the design of today's grids prevents them from sharing
electricity. The grid resembles the hub and spokes of a bicycle wheel.
Huge power plants that run on natural gas, nuclear, wind, and
solar---mostly located far from the cities they serve---send electricity
via "long-haul" transmission lines to substations in urban
neighborhoods. ComEd has several hundred substations in the city of
Chicago alone. Some get their power from a single plant, others from a
blend of, say, renewables and natural gas from multiple facilities.

The substations are equipped with transformers that collect all that
high-voltage electricity, and step down the voltages to a level that's
safe for homes and stores. The stations' circuit breakers cut off the
power flowing from the big plants if too much voltage is arriving. By
the way, you seldom see or recognize a substation while walking around a
city. They're often installed in a brownstone that just looks like a
residence, or sheltered in the basements of apartment buildings. That's
a sketch of the transmission and distribution system as it stands today.

The spokes are the lines that run directly from the substations to the
homes, apartment buildings, and businesses in their service areas. But
the hubs or nodes in the system, the substations, aren't connected to
each other. Their function is strictly distribution, sending the
electricity from power plants to their customers. They don't form a
network at all. They can't back each other up by having substation A
that has excess capacity channel electricity to substation B when B is
short on power or has shut down during a heat wave, a cyber hack, or an
equipment failure.

Because today's substations operate as islands or silos, each one needs
to be designed with far more capacity than it uses most of the time. The
reason is twofold. First, the stations must contain transformers and
other gear big enough to meet times of peak demand, such as 100-degree
days when everyone's running the AC to keep cool. Second, some of the
equipment at a substation will occasionally malfunction. So they need
even more backup so that the gear that remains working can compensate
for the parts most likely to break down. "All told, most substations
have built-in redundancy of 100%," says McGahn, meaning they're designed
and constructed to generate twice as much juice as their customers
consume on a typical day.

Obviously, [[connecting substations would be a **great
solution**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Today, [[in case of a
cyberattack]{.underline}]{.mark} on one substation, [the other stations
loaded with excess capacity can't send their power to light and heat the
homes suffering the blackout.]{.underline} Nor can a substation in the
suburbs that has extra capacity on a hot day dispatch it to a maxed-out
station in a city center.

[But the stations couldn't link up for two reasons]{.underline}. First,
[the traditional copper cables]{.underline} used to move power [were too
bulky to fit]{.underline} into the rights-of-way for the much smaller
conduits running from the stations to homes and buildings. Second, if
and when a substation sends power to another substation, that power
starts in a big surge. That surge is powerful enough to knock out the
transformers in the station receiving the electricity. [Worse,
if]{.underline} several [substations are connected, the rush can cause a
domino effect that disables a whole series of stations.]{.underline} The
supposed solution would turn into a disaster on the scale of a cyber
hack. That cascading effect is how many blackouts in the past have
occurred.

**[How the new REG technology would harden and expand the
grid]{.underline}**

AMSC's superconductor technology miniaturizes power transmission. [Its
Amperium wire is made from a copper oxide compound that,]{.underline}
for the same weight, [enables it to carry 200 times the
voltage]{.underline} of the regular copper wire that's the traditional
foundation for transmission. When electricity travels one mile over
copper cable, as much as one-third of the power is lost during that
trip. By contrast, electricity can cover any distance over
superconductor wire and suffer no electrical loss.

The U.S. Navy deploys the AMSC\'s Amperium superconductors to protect
its ships from mines. [The technology is calibrated to mask the magnetic
field spread]{.underline} by the vessels so they don't trigger the
underwater explosives. But utilities were still reluctant to deploy
superconductors for joining substations. They acknowledged that
superconductors solved the space problem: They can fit inside
six-inch--diameter conduits and pipes that run well within the
rights-of-way going from the substations to customers. The rights-of-way
for each substation overlap with those of other stations, making it
possible to extend the wires from one substation to another in the next
neighborhood, or even 50 miles away.

The obstacle: The superconductor technology hadn't solved the
"overcurrent" problem that could cause rolling blackouts. But AMSC's
Amperium was the breakthrough. It combined the ability to carry huge
amounts of power over a small wire with an outer layer called a
"super-resistor" that tames the surges, and also protects against
lightning strikes that could cause cascading outages.

What the Chicago project could mean for cybersecurity and more

As McGahn puts it, [the REG technology provides an extension cord
between the now-vulnerable nodes in the nation's urban power grids. [If
substations are linked]{.mark}]{.underline}, [power]{.underline} from
those still functioning **[[would automatically flow to]{.mark} the
[customers]{.mark} of the station that's attacked]{.underline}** or hit
by extreme weather. In addition, utilities will be getting far more of
their power from renewable sources in the future, and that power shuts
off when the wind's not blowing or even when the sun goes behind a
cloud. Grids will need a lot more backup capacity to compensate for that
intermittent energy. Linking substations would provide that support
without needing to continue the current strategy of building still more
substations to ensure sufficient backup.

The Chicago project links just two substations. For McGahn and ComEd the
ideal solution is joining many or even all the nodes in one giant
network that operates in a kind of buddy system. McGahn wants to create
a "super-grid" that allows for more renewables without adding lots of
backup capacity, and hence at a much lower cost than would be required
under the current system. His vision would make our grids much safer,
and enable the grid to channel electricity where it's needed, when it's
needed, in exactly the amounts it's needed, with far less need for
excess capacity.

It's a big vision for an old, and some would say stodgy, industry. But
[[it would unite aging infrastructure with]{.mark} new technology to
[make]{.mark} America's most vulnerable [pressure points]{.mark}, where
terrorists and hackers are now taking aim, **[far more
secure.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[Managing risk]{.underline}]{.mark}, even for a simplistic supply
chain, [has [become a **professional
responsibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}, both small and large private sector
[[organizations]{.underline} [employ logistici]{.underline}]{.mark}[ans,
[continuity experts, and risk analysts]{.mark}]{.underline} to help
identify and mitigate risks to their enterprise. Their [[focus can be
everything from **coordination of supply**]{.mark} **and demand** [to
minimizing]{.mark} [disruption]{.mark}]{.underline} of normal
activities. For the purpose of this research, [disruption risks are
examined]{.underline}, as they are more likely to intersect with the
roles and responsibilities of public safety officials. \[2\]
Furthermore, [those in the [public sector]{.mark}]{.underline} may be
able to **[[effect]{.underline}]{.mark}** the most **[[change around
them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Disruption risks can be described in four
broad categories: operational contingencies, natural hazards, terrorism,
and political instability. Operational contingencies are systematic
failures, such as the August 2003 Northeastern United States grid
blackout, which caused curtailment of operations for many supply and
demand nodes. \[2, 3\]. Natural hazards are events such as hurricanes,
wildfires, earthquakes, or flooding which can disrupt critical
components of a supply chain -- such as the fuel shortages in the New
York--New Jersey area following Superstorm Sandy in 2012. \[4\]
Terrorism, the next category of disruption risks, may include
indiscriminate destruction of critical supply chain components or
targeted sabotage of known critical assets and systems. \[3\] Lastly,
political instability may disrupt supply chains, such as oil production
curtailment in Iraq and Syria, given the regional strife since 2012.

In the United States, operational contingencies and natural hazards are
among the most likely disruption risks to significantly affect supply
chains that are critical to communities following a disaster. The
effects of these disruptions may directly impact the ability of a
community to obtain food, fuel, prescription medication, or other
critical goods and services in the minutes, days, or weeks following a
disaster. [[Understanding]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[behavior]{.mark}
of]{.underline} these [supply chains]{.underline}, particularly in near
real-time after a disaster, may [[help officials to make]{.mark} **more
[informed decisions]{.mark}** regarding response and recovery
activities]{.underline}.

#### Cyber attacks won't take down the grid

http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/02/02/u-s-power-grid-is-vulnerable-but-dont-panic-just-yet.html

The idea of the nation\'s power grids becoming the next battleground for
cyber warriors could make hacking into consumers' credit card accounts
and personal information seem like child's play. [[While]{.mark} U.S.
[power companies are likely targeted]{.mark} by foreign
governments]{.underline} and others in increasingly sophisticated
breaches, **[[actually shutting off]{.mark} the lights]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline} **[causing chaos]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[far more complicated]{.underline}** [than]{.underline}]{.mark} [many
[pundits make it seem]{.mark}.]{.underline} Dan [Scali]{.underline},
[senior manager of industrial control systems at Mandiant, a
cybersecurity consulting arm of FireEye
([FEYE](http://www.foxbusiness.com/quote.html?stockTicker=FEYE)),]{.underline}
[explained]{.underline} that [while cyber criminals]{.underline} [may
gain [access]{.mark} to power and utility data systems]{.underline},
[it]{.underline} **[[doesn't]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[mean]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the result will be [a]{.mark} **power
[outage]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} a **total [takedown]{.mark}** of power
grid control systems.]{.underline} In other words, [the power g[rid
is]{.mark} controlled by **[more than just]{.mark} a panel** of digital
[buttons. ]{.mark}]{.underline}["[Losing]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
[control]{.mark} system is bad]{.underline} from the perspective that it
takes you out of your normal mode of operations of being able to control
everything from one command center, [but]{.underline} [it [**doesn't**
mean]{.mark} you've lost control or all the **[lights go
out]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[in the city\]," Scali explained. While many
of the systems have been modernized to include digitized control panels,
[if a hacker were to infiltrate the system, [a utility worker could
still]{.mark} have the ability to]{.underline} **[[manually
control]{.mark} the [machines]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[by]{.underline}
**[flipping a switch]{.underline}**]{.mark}, pushing a button, or
tripping a breaker. As the world saw with the recent attack in Ukraine,
which caused a blackout for 80,000 customers of the nation's western
utility, the biggest problem may be ensuring the power grid's control
systems are not vulnerable to cyber break ins. The January attack in
Ukraine was likely caused by a corrupted Microsoft Word attachment that
allowed remote control over the computer, according to the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security. Scali said [[there was **no
ev**]{.mark}**idence** from the incident in Ukraine that the hacker's
[**malware** was able to **physically shut down**]{.mark} the
[power]{.mark}.]{.underline} "It wiped out machines, deleted all the
files. Kill disk malware made it impossible to remotely control things.
It caused chaos on the business network, and the area where control
system operations sat. But the attacker, we believe, would have had to
actually used the control system to cause load shedding, which caused
the power to go out, or trip breakers to cause the actual problem.
Malware itself didn't turn the power out," Scali said. He said what most
likely happened in that incident was the hacker stole user credentials
and logged into the system remotely. The bottom line: Yes, a similar
event could happen in the U.S. And corporate America is concerned. A
recent survey released in January on the state of information security,
conducted by consulting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers, showed
cybersecurity as one of the biggest concerns among the top brass at U.S.
power and utilities firms. Part of the problem, Brad Bauch, security and
cyber sector leader at PwC said, is the interconnectedness of the
industry's tools. "Utilities want to be able to get information out of
\[their\] systems to more efficiently operate them, and also share that
information with customers so they have more real-time information into
their usage," he explained. While allowing access to their own
consumption data allows the companies to give their customers more of
what they want, it also opens up a host of access points for hackers,
making the systems more vulnerable than they otherwise would be. But
[[to say]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} power [grid is susceptible to
cyber]{.mark} hackers [is]{.mark} a bit of an
**[oversimplification]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### Grid's resilient\-\--no collapse

http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/07/a-u-s-blackout-as-large-as-indias-very-unlikely/

[As India recovers from a blackout]{.underline} that left the world's
second-largest country --- and more than 600 million residents --- [in
the dark, a ripple of uncertainty moved through the]{.underline} Federal
Regulatory Commission's command [center today in the U.S.]{.underline}
The Indian crisis had some people asking about the vulnerability of
America's grid.

"[What people really want to know today is, can something like India
happen here?]{.underline} So if there is an outage or some problem in
the Northeast, can it actually spread all the way to California," John
Wellinghoff, the commission's chairman, told ABC News. "**[[It's very,
very unlikely that ultimately would happen]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[Wellinghoff said that first, the grid was divided in the middle of the
nation. [Engineers said that it also was monitored more closely than
ever. The grid is checked for]{.mark} line [surges **30 times a
second**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the Northeast blackout in 2003 --- the largest in the U.S., which
affected 55 million --- **[[16,000 miles of new transmission lines have
been added to the grid]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

And [even though some lines]{.underline} in the Northeast
[are]{.underline} more than 70 years [old, Wellinghoff said that the
chances of a blackout like India's were very low.]{.underline}

*CTC Sentinel*, Vol. 3, Iss. 4, April, p. 9-11, Emory Libraries\]

While there is little doubt concerning the economic salience of the
Malacca Strait, carrying out decisive [attacks against ships transiting
through this corridor is]{.underline} somewhat [more challenging than
commonly portrayed]{.underline}. One of the most frequently postulated
scenarios is that [terrorists]{.underline} could attempt to disrupt the
commercial viability of the Strait, either by [detonating a hijacked oil
or LNG tanker to shut down a]{.underline} prominent [commercial
terminal]{.underline} (such as the Port of Singapore) [or]{.underline}
by [scuttling a large ship to block]{.underline} the
through-[passage]{.underline} of maritime traffic.8 Although
theoretically possible, [realization of both attack contingencies would
be difficult to achieve]{.underline}.

[[Igniting pressurized LNG or oil is **technically
problematic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unless these substances vent in
their liquid form and mix with air in the correct ratio, [[the
**probability** of]{.mark} either substance fully [catching fire is
**extremely low**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[**Even if** this did occur,
the lateral force of any]{.mark} subsequent [explosion
would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[**be contained** by the tanker's
hull, which would force the]{.mark} destructive [energy
**upwards**]{.mark} rather than outwards]{.underline} (thus [minimizing
its destructive potential]{.underline}).9 [[Sinking a]{.mark} major
oceangoing [freighter is **equally as challenging**]{.mark} [and would,
**at a minimum**, require]{.mark} the perpetrating group to have ready
access to a [large quantity of explosives, the time and means to
transport this material and the expertise to know where to place]{.mark}
the [bombs]{.mark} to cause a critical breach]{.underline}.
[[These]{.mark} logistical and knowledge barriers]{.underline} would
[[pose **formidable barriers** for a **single
attack**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[much less]{.mark} an assault that
targeted]{.underline} two or **[[three ships]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(which would be [[**required** to]{.mark} truly [block the

Fellow at the Atlantic Council. Ryan Maness, an American cybersecurity
expert, Defense Analysis Professor at Naval Postgraduate School. \[How
We Stopped Worrying about Cyber Doom and Started Collecting Data,
Politics and Governance, 6(2), Cogitatio Press\]

6\. Expanding Cyber Security Data [Our team has been
[coding]{.mark}]{.underline} cyber incident [data [since
2010]{.mark}]{.underline} and serves as a unique example of how the
process of collecting cyber security data and evidence can be done. Our
first peer reviewed published work appeared in 2014 in Journal of Peace
Research (Valeriano & Maness, 2014). In this article we note that
[[cyber conflict is]{.mark} **much more [restrained]{.mark}** than
generally understood]{.underline} by popular discourse. [[Threat
inflation is **ripe**]{.mark} **in cyber security**]{.underline}, and
the real use of cyber tools seems to be to enhance the power of strong
states.

The data that Valeriano and Maness (2014, 2015) have built challenges
the cyber revolution perspective and does so with the tools of social
science, and is a necessary turn given the general tone of the debate.
We first determine that a viable data collection method in light of
limited resources was to focus on states that are committed interstate
rivals (Diehl & Goertz, 2001). This allows us to focus on those actors
with an intense history of recent hostilities that should be the most
likely users of cyber technology on the battlefield (Maness & Valeriano,
2018).

In our research (Maness & Valeriano, 2016; Maness, Valeriano, & Jensen,
2017; Valeriano & Maness, 2014, 2015), we have been able to marshal a
massive amount of evidence that is useful in dissecting the actual
trends on the cyber battlefield in a geopolitical context. We
demonstrate that while [[cyber-attacks]{.mark} are increasing in
frequency, they [are limited **in severity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, are
[**directly [connected]{.mark}** [to **traditional**]{.mark}
**territorial [disagreements]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly
[[take the shape of]{.mark} **espionage and [low-level]{.mark}
disruptive [campaigns]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} **outright
[war]{.mark}fare**]{.underline}.

Given this data-based perspective, we question the dynamics of the cyber
security debate and offer a countering theory where [[states]{.mark} are
[restrain]{.mark}ed from using more malicious cyber actions [due
to]{.mark} the **[limited nature]{.mark} of the weapons**, **the
possibly of [blowback]{.mark}**, the [connection between]{.mark} the
digital world and civilian [infrastructure, and]{.mark} the
[reality]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[any]{.mark} cyber [weapon]{.mark}
launched [can be **replicated** and **used**]{.mark} **right
[back]{.mark} against the attacker**]{.underline}. Given all of these
perspectives gleamed from the data, [we must moderate our
views]{.underline} about the transformation that is offered by cyber
strategists who stress a more revolutionist tone (Lango, 2016).

[[Social science]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly
**[[matters]{.underline}]{.mark}** for contemporary technological policy
debates. [[Absent]{.mark} **rigorous [methods]{.mark}**]{.underline},
much of what is in [[the field is]{.underline}]{.mark} basically
**[[guesswork]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Our work really owes an
intellectual debt to J. David Singer, who started the effort to quantify
war at the University of Michigan with the Correlates of War (COW)
project (Small & Singer, 1982). Our project builds on this methodology
and uses many of the same coding strategies. We recognize that data is a
work in progress and seek to build more and more knowledge through
subsequent updates. By gathering the full picture, we can gain the
perspective that really matters in these emerging policy debates
regarding the cyber battlefield.

#### Err [against]{.underline} catastrophe.

president and director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies; \"Dismissing Cyber
Catastrophe,\"
https://www.csis.org/analysis/dismissing-cyber-catastrophe\]

This is a short overview of why [[catastrophe is
**unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Several longer CSIS reports go into
the reasons in some detail. Past performance may not necessarily predict
the future, but [[after **25 years** without **a**]{.mark} **single
[catastrophic]{.mark} cyber[attack]{.mark}**, we should invoke the
concept cautiously, if at all]{.underline}. Why then, it is raised so
often?

Some of the explanation for the emphasis on cyber catastrophe is
hortatory. When [the author of one of the first reports]{.underline} (in
the 1990s) to sound the alarm over cyber catastrophe was asked later why
he had warned of a cyber Pearl Harbor when it was clear this was not
going to happen, his reply was that he [hoped to **scare people** into
action. [\"Catastrophe]{.mark} is nigh; we must act\" [was]{.mark}
**possibly a [reasonable]{.mark}**]{.underline} strategy [[22 years
ago]{.mark}, but **[no longer]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The resilience of historical events to remain culturally significant
must be taken into account for an objective assessment of cyber warfare,
and this will require the United States to discard some hypothetical
scenarios. [**The long [experience]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **living
under** [the **shadow** of **nuc**]{.mark}**lear [annihilation]{.mark}**
still **shapes** American **thinking** [and]{.mark} **conditions** the
**U**nited **S**tates to **expect extreme** outcomes. American thinking
is also shaped by]{.underline} the experience of
**[[9/11]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a wrenching attack that caught the
United States by surprise. [[Fears]{.mark} of another]{.underline} 9/11
[[reinforce]{.mark} the memory of nuclear war in driving [the
**catastrophe trope**]{.mark}, but when applied to cyberattack, [these
scenarios **do not track** with]{.mark} **[operation]{.mark}al
requirement[s]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} the nature of [opponent]{.mark}
**strategy and [planning]{.mark}**. The contours of **cyber warfare**
are emerging, but]{.underline} they [are not always what we discuss.

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[profound disruptive

chains,]{.mark} demand for]{.underline} consumer [goods rose
strongly]{.underline} last year. [We expect merchandise world [trade

**[in 2021]{.underline}** [compared to the previous year]{.underline},
surpassing its pre-pandemic level by 4.3%. The growth rates of global
merchandise trade should return to pre-pandemic levels this year,
supported by industrial growth, global demand for goods remaining
elevated, and only a limited shift of consumption back to services.

And [[that]{.mark} double-digit expected increase [comes **in spite

row. [That\'s according to the World Trade Monitor for November from
CPB]{.underline}. An increase in exports (+2.8%) and imports (+3.6%)
mainly in advanced economies led to the rise in trade volumes, while
China\'s exports decreased 4.1%. Imports showed modest growth of 1.2%.
With some delay, this is also reflected in global container throughput
which is regaining traction.

[Going into 2022, we expect trade growth rates to return to their
pre-pandemic levels]{.underline} in line with a continued but weakened
global economic recovery. For this year, we pencil in a growth rate in
merchandise world trade of 4.1% compared to 10.6% the year before, while
we expect world GDP growth to come in at 4.4% from 6.1% in 2021. [2021
was an exceptional year driven by pandemic-related catch-up effects.
Despite ongoing supply chain frictions and average containerised
transport costs]{.underline} expected to remain high, **[we still expect
to see a decent growth rate.]{.underline}**

We expect the global economy will gain traction and enter a new phase
should the Omicron wave become significantly less of a threat by the
European spring. The experience of almost two years of crisis shows that
economies can adapt, suggesting any new regional lockdowns should have
less of an impact. That said, a shift by consumers back into services
will only be moderate in 2022 because of Covid caution. They might
reduce some of their increased spending on the likes of electronics and
furniture while resuming spending on services all the while seeing
higher energy and food prices. Overall, however, the preference for
goods remains elevated.

In the US, for example, the share of goods spending as a proportion of
total personal consumption expenditure continues to hover around 35%,
well above its 31% average in 2019. This indicates a continued goods\'
preference in the first quarter of 2022.

Ongoing labour shortages around the globe argue in favour of a rebound
in wage growth and an improvement in workers' bargaining power. This, in
turn, means we should see an environment of continued elevated demand,
fueling world trade volumes. However, there is a risk that real wages
will remain negative despite those higher wages with worldwide inflation
expected to surge to 4.6% this year.

Through 2022, however, we expect inflation to subside, which leaves room
for real income growth to turn positive in the second half of the year.
In the eurozone, data seems to confirm this with manufacturers
mentioning easing sourcing constraints which in part helped to ease
input price inflation to the lowest level since last April. Governmental
fiscal support and infrastructure plans, partly related to the green
transition, also point to a continued positive investment outlook
despite a tightening of financing conditions from major central banks,

Asia to remain a driving force in 2022

Trade growth remains uneven, however, when you look at different
regions. The divergence across blocks and individual countries has
been - and will be - driven by the progress and speed of vaccinations
and the dependence on intermediate goods. Intra-Asia trade still has
strong growth perspectives. Following an improvement in Asian industrial
production over 2021 as well as significantly higher container
throughput in Shanghai (+8%) and other major Chinese ports, the general
macroeconomic outlook for Asia and especially China depends on Covid,
chip shortages and the US relationship.

A slowing of economic activity in China remains a concern for
northeastern Asian industrial economies. Cooling industrial demand for
coal and iron ore from China has already led to bulk freight rates
easing after a commodity-driven peak. Chinese trade flows may also be
more volatile this year due to less real estate construction but more
infrastructure investment may help to balance that out.

On a global level, we expect larger flows of oil and oil products
alongside the global recovery of road and airline traffic and we think
that China should remain a major driver of growth for metals exposed to
the energy transition. We expect global automotive production to
increase by up to 10% (we\'ve written more about that here) and that
will create extra trade volumes but the semiconductor shortage will be a
limiting factor.

Lastly, the implementation of regional trade agreements such as the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) within the
Asia-Pacific area coming into force as of the beginning of the year or
the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) promoting intra-African
trade, will likely affect regional trade flows.

Supply chain slump and elevated tariffs will drag through 2022

So it all looks positive but it doesn\'t mean we don\'t face any
obstacles to our growth outlook. A combination of shipping capacity and
container shortages, unforeseen incidents, whether those be terminal
closures in China or another blockage of the Suez Canal, and we could
also see labour shortfalls which helped lead to spiking container rates
last year. And 2022 started off with new records here. Based on UNCTAD
data, those costs pushed China to Europe port-to-port container costs up
to some 15% of the average goods transported (up from 2-3%).

The effect of massive port congestion occupying 10-15% of the global
fleet capacity feeds back to that disruption. We\'ve perhaps seen the
biggest impact of that in the US. Container ships waiting at Los
Angeles-Long Beach (covering 40% of US containerised imports) hit record
levels in January with shortages at port sites and a lack of truck
drivers to push goods further down the line. In Europe, the effect is
less pronounced but still, ports are packed too. In China, we have seen
similar squeezes in the Ningbo, Tianjin and Zhenzhen ports because of
the country\'s zero-Covid policy. After Chinese New Year we do expect
things to improve. But when spot rates come down, term contract rates of
large shippers are still being negotiated higher.

We concluded earlier that container rates will remain under upward
pressure and won't return to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. A record
wave of newly ordered ultra-large container vessels will come online
from 2023 and 2024 but the container shipping sector is much more
consolidated with three large alliances. Container liners also have
learned to manage capacity better. The container sector is also entering
the energy transition with retailers aiming to reach zero-emission
seabound trade by 2040 and companies are facing some sort of CO2
pricing. Maersk already started the shift by ordering 12 methanol-ready
container vessels. But, in any case, fuel is expected to be more
expensive, and that has an upward pressure on prices too, of course.

Risks ahead but trade fundamentals are still solid

The pandemic remains an uncertain factor affecting the outlook for 2022.
[Supply chain troubles and [higher shipping costs]{.mark}]{.underline}
also continue to pose risks to growth. At the same time, last year also
[showed]{.underline} **[this [doesn't]{.mark}]{.underline}** necessarily
**[[hamper]{.mark} the world from continuing to
[trade]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[[The economics of trade **still make sense**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[There are not many examples of [re-shoring]{.mark} yet as this takes
time; it requires a high level of automation, and [it\'s **easier said
than done**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [shippers]{.underline} do
[consider multi-sourcing options, buffer stocks and longer
contracts]{.underline} and **[this is still highly
supportive]{.underline}**.

[So, we\'re **optimistic**]{.underline} [given the economic
outlook]{.underline}, a hopefully receding pandemic, [and clear evidence
of richly filled order books,]{.underline} notably in the automotive
sector. [[We expect trade]{.mark} volume [growth to hold up]{.mark} well
this year, [resulting in]{.mark} a more moderate but still [sound
growth]{.mark} rate [for]{.mark}]{.underline} merchandise [[world
trade.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[During]{.mark} the]{.underline} 20[08]{.underline} [[financial
crisis]{.mark}, the volume of world trade initially
plummeted]{.underline} by more than it had during the Great Depression
in the 1930s (Eichengreen and O'Rourke 2010). Since many developing
countries could legally raise their applied tariffs without violating
their WTO commitments, [[there were]{.mark} widespread [fears]{.mark}
that the [protectionist responses]{.mark} that]{.underline} had
[occurred during the Great Depression [were likely]{.mark} to be
repeated]{.underline}. [[Yet the system displayed]{.mark} **remarkable
[resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Undoubtedly the disastrous
experience of the 1930s served as an **important
consideration**]{.underline} [motivating the G20 countries to issue
statements **pledging their opposition to
protectionism**]{.underline}.12 But [their actions spoke even
louder]{.underline} than their words.

As shown in figure 1, [the crisis is **simply not evident** in the
average global tariff data]{.underline} for 2008 and 2009: [The average
applied MFN [tariff rates in the]{.mark} immediate aftermath of the
[crisis were **no higher**]{.mark} than they were before
it.]{.underline} This is not to say that no countries raised their
[tariffs]{.underline}, but the [increases]{.underline} [were offset by
other countries' reductions]{.underline}.13 In addition, as chronicled
by the Global Trade Alert (a network of trade analysts that monitor
trade policy actions), [some countries did use temporary tariff
measures]{.underline} such as safeguards antidumping and countervailing
duties.

But [[studies]{.mark} that take such actions into account still
[conclude]{.mark} that [there was **remarkable
restraint**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.mark} respect to [import
barriers]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, using an overall Trade
Restrictiveness Index that includes not only MFN tariffs but those
applied in free trade agreements and other preferential arrangements,
Hiao Looi Kee, Cristina Neagu, and Alessandro Nicita (2013) found that
[together the impacts of tariffs and antidumping measures accounted for
**less than 2 percent** of]{.underline} the collapse of world trade in
response to the crisis. Among their explanations is that "[countries are
likely to take account]{.underline} of the [diverse impact of
tariffs]{.underline} [in raising input costs for products]{.underline}
used in their exports" (p. 343).

[Looking back]{.underline} from the vantage point of 2019, the Global
Trade Alert found that in response to the crisis, "[transparent import
[restrictions were placed on just 1]{.mark}.4 [percent of]{.mark} world
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, with another 6.9 and 20.8 percent of world
trade being subject to subsidies to import competing firms and state
largess to exporters respectively." However, [almost all the temporary
import restrictions]{.underline} and half of the subsidies to
import-competing firms **[were unwound]{.underline}** by 2013.

Simon Evenett and Richard Baldwin (2020) note that patterns of trade
have remained more heavily distorted by export subsidies since the
financial crisis; but while they do distort trade, in principle export
subsidies should increase rather than reduce trade.

[While]{.underline} the [declining]{.underline} growth in
[trade]{.underline} volumes [relative to GDP]{.underline} since 2011
[has been the focus of much discussion]{.underline}, **[increased trade
protection does not appear to be the reason]{.underline}**. As shown in
figure 1 there was a small increase in average global
[tariffs]{.underline} in 2009--11, but it was more than fully reversed
by 2012, and by 2017 global trade-weighted average applied MFN rates
[were **considerably lower**]{.underline} than they had been in 2008.

Marc Auboin and Floriana Borino (2017) studied the falling elasticity of
global trade to economic activity and found that while the slowdown in
the growth of global value chains and changes in the composition of
demand were important parts of the explanation for slower trade
responses to growth after 2011, "[protectionism]{.underline} **[does not
come up as statistically significant."]{.underline}**

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

This Policy Brief has provided evidence that even setting aside
participation in regional and multilateral trade agreements, [developing
countries have steadily narrowed the differences between their tariffs
and those of the United States. They have also revealed a **preference
for lower tariffs**]{.underline} by consistently applying tariffs that
are much lower than those obligated by the WTO. [Their commitment to
lower tariffs was shown by their discipline **in not**]{.underline}, on
average, **[raising tariffs in response to the financial
crisis]{.underline}** [in 2008 and their **continued
reductions**]{.underline} in applied tariffs between 2011 and 2017. The
available data at the country level show additional reductions in 2018.
[The commitment to these lower rates is]{.underline} also [evident in
the regimes for administered protection instituted by several countries,
requiring proof of serious injury]{.underline} and other conditions
[before safeguard protection is provided.]{.underline}

[All [this liberalizing behavior reflects **widespread changes in views
of**]{.mark} **trade [protection]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The spread of
global value chains, which have increased the import content of both
exports and domestic production, have convinced many that increased
protection can reduce domestic output and employment.

In many industries supply chains consist of production facilities that
produce highly customized goods and services that are not easy for firms
to produce in other countries or to shift back to their home country. It
is noteworthy that, [[for all their]{.mark} [talk]{.mark}
about]{.underline} the North American Free Trade Agreement ([NAFTA)
being a disastrous trade agreement]{.underline}, both President
[[Trump]{.mark} and]{.underline} many [Democrats [agreed
to]{.mark}]{.underline} a US-Mexico-Canada Agreement ([[USMCA)]{.mark}
that made **far fewer modifications**]{.underline} [to the original
agreement]{.underline} than might have been expected from their
rhetoric.14

Since 2018, however, global supply chains have been subjected to two
major shocks: the first from US trade policies and the countermeasures
other countries have taken in response, and the second from the COVID-19
pandemic, which initially set off a global scramble for medical
equipment. Some commentators have responded to these disruptions by
arguing that countries should now be more self-sufficient (Rapoza
2020).15 And [it is common to see predictions that the world has now
passed the high point of globalization.]{.underline} [But]{.underline}
it is too soon to tell whether these developments will lead to a
reversal of the policy trends discussed in this Policy Brief.

[The recent shocks]{.underline} certainly [point to the desirability of
diversification of supply chains]{.underline} and the need for adequate
domestic strategic reserves of essential products. Pinelopi Goldberg
(2020) makes the case that [they have]{.underline} also [underscored the
extent to which countries are **interdependent**]{.underline}. [And they
have shown]{.underline} the ability of an open global system to enable
more **[resilient responses]{.underline}** than those based on
self-reliance---the WTO has documented that, in response to the
pandemic, trade-facilitating measures undertaken by the G20 have far
outweighed trade-restricting measures.16

Indeed, [[despite]{.mark} the [talk of deglobalization]{.mark}, many
[countries have]{.mark} recently **[increased]{.mark} their
[commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline} to further trade liberalization,
albeit at the regional level. Since 2018, for example, [11 Asia-Pacific
countries have implemented the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement
for Trans-Pacific Partnership, more than 50 countries agreed to the
African Continental Free Trade Area, and 15 countries in the
Asia-Pacific concluded the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership
in late 2020.]{.underline}

As Mark Twain said about his death, [[reports of the end of
globalization]{.underline}]{.mark} may be **[[greatly
exaggerated]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

This [indicates]{.underline} that the **[increase]{.underline}** [of
economic [interdependence does not]{.mark} lead to a]{.underline}
**[[decrease]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of]{.underline} the [[interstate
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} as captured by defense expenses. On the
contrary the increase of exports of country 1 to country 2 leads to an
increase of the expenses of both countries. Hence, [both countries seem
to **consider**]{.underline} the [conflict as]{.underline}
**[vivid]{.underline}** [even though]{.underline} some [trade activity
is built]{.underline}. This may be attributed to the fact that the
defense expenses of these countries are not necessarily related to the
particular interstate conflict with the investigated pair in the dyad.
It could also be due to the fact that the economic crisis has
potentially led to a decrease of both the economic activity and the
defense expenses in some cases. This explains partially the results.
Furthermore, country 1 is not always the stronger economy. In addition,
it is not necessarily the country that has initiated the conflict. These
findings indicate that the topic needs to be further investigated so as
to incorporate more dyads and potentially additional proxies of
interstate conflict and economic interdependence in order to realize
whether the latter impacts the former.

\[Table omitted\]

The impact of the independent variables and their explanation is
summarized in Table 4.

In political terms, policymakers may find [these]{.underline}
**[[empirical results]{.underline}]{.mark}** interesting as they
[[show]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[they cannot rely]{.underline}
**[solely]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}]{.mark} [the strengthening
of]{.underline} bilateral [[trade]{.underline}]{.mark} in order
[to]{.underline} end or **[reduce]{.underline}** the
[conflict]{.underline}. In addition, [[according to]{.underline}
**[other studies]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [establishing]{.underline} a
free [[trade]{.underline}]{.mark} area may be the way for fostering
economic ties and interdependence with potential rivals, however, it
[will be]{.underline} [**[difficult]{.underline}** [to have
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[critical [impact]{.mark}]{.underline}** on
conflict [if this cannot happen]{.underline} in bilateral level [without
any degree of]{.underline} economic **[integration]{.underline}**.
Therefore, [we cannot expect]{.underline}, at least for the mentioned
cases, **[de-escalation]{.underline}** or elimination [of the conflict
caused by increased economic activity]{.underline} between the rivals.
Therefore, other routes need to be explored so that an interstate
conflict can be reduced or eliminated through trade.

6\. Conclusions and Further Research

In the present analysis, a [[study]{.mark} of]{.underline} the impact of
economic **[interdependence]{.underline}** on interstate conflict [was
attempted with the [use]{.mark} of a sample that consisted
of]{.underline} **[[three dyads]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of countries
facing]{.underline} a similar context of **[interstate]{.underline}**
[conflict]{.underline}: [**[India-Pakistan]{.underline}**,
**[Russia-Ukraine]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Yemen-Saudi]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[Arabia]{.underline}**. The
results show that only exports from country 1 to country 2 have an
impact on the level of defense expenses either for country 1 or for
country 2. This [indicates]{.underline} that economic
[interdependence]{.underline} **[does not]{.underline}** necessarily
[reduce interstate conflicts, since both [countries]{.mark}]{.underline}
1 and 2 **[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [[defense
expenses]{.underline}]{.mark} even though exports from country 1 to
country 2 increase. Our contribution in the current literature relies
upon the correlation between defense expenses and bilateral trade and is
in the direction of the research of Seitz et al. (2015). There has been
a big diversity of dependent variables employed in the relevant studies,
such as trade expectations (Copeland, 1996), common interests (Li and
Sacko, 2002), interaction between domestic politics and the
international system (Kapstein, 2003), income ratio (Martin et al.,
2008), Preferential Trade Agreements (Herge et al., 2010; Long, 2008),
trade (Barbieri and Levy, 1999; Long and Leeds, 2006), Militarized
Interstate Disputes (MIDs) (Copeland, 1996; Oneal and Russett, 1999;
Gartzke et al., 2001; Powers, 2004; Martin et al., 2008; Li and Reuveny,
2011). As all studies, it has certain limitations that primarily stem
from data availability; three dyads where analyzed and certain proxies
were used. Consequently the results depend purely on the span of the
dataset. Our future research venues include the extension to additional
dyads to more variables that are relevant to the interstate conflict as
well as the economic interdependence, provided data become available.
Furthermore, as indicated by the anonymous reviewers, it is worth
investigating whether the strength of defense can affect the mutual
trade of two countries. In addition, as recommended by the anonymous
reviewers it would be interesting to apply game theoretical approaches
in order to establish the hypotheses around economic interdependencies
prior to the investigation of the correlation of the latter to the
interstate conflict.

[[There are]{.mark},]{.underline} broadly speaking, [two]{.underline}
aspects to the [[attribution problem]{.mark}. The first is the technical
problem]{.underline} of [how to identify]{.underline} the true origin of
[a]{.underline} particular [attack and]{.underline} the
[identity]{.underline} of [those who carried it out. The second
is]{.underline} the legal question of whether and if so,
[when]{.underline}, factual [attribution allows a state to be held
responsible]{.underline} for the cyberattack under international law.

[[The technical consequences]{.mark} of the unique characteristics of
cyberattacks [have been **widely
acknowledged**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Dan Efrony and Yuval Shany
have highlighted two key differences between cyber and other kinds of
attacks: [[the **boundlessness**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[anonymity]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [cyber]{.mark}
domain]{.underline}.Footnote11 As cyberspace [[is not limited]{.mark} by
physical or geographical borders]{.underline}, questions of jurisdiction
and enforcement become more complex[. [Perpetrators use various
techniques to obscure]{.underline}]{.mark} [their true [location, and
isolating the origin of a]{.mark} [cyberattack is **extraordinarily
difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline} when [[attacks are routed]{.mark}
through **multiple machines**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} **[multiple
locations across the world]{.underline}**. [[These techniques make the
task of]{.mark} retrospectively [establishing a forensic
link]{.mark}]{.underline} between an attacker and an incident
**[[extremely difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They allow cyberattacks
to be carried out with **little risk to those involved**]{.underline},
[with perpetrators able to mask their identity and]{.underline}
potentially even **[misattribute blame.]{.underline}**

Thus, [[cyberattacks often take more time to detect]{.underline}]{.mark}
and evaluate than traditional kinetic attacks. [[This analysis might
require using classified intelligence]{.mark} and technological
capabilities [that **a state would prefer not to reveal**.]{.mark} All
of [these factors make it **challenging to attribute
cyberattacks.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[These technical difficulties]{.underline}]{.mark} have two main
consequences for attribution, both of which are critical in relation to
cyber armed attacks. The first is that the [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}
of **[[misattribution]{.underline}]{.mark}** is heightened, [[leading
to]{.mark} the potential for **[serious conflict
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [if a state mistakenly targets an
innocent third party]{.underline} in its self-defense response. [The
second is that the length of time it will realistically take to
correctly identify the perpetrator]{.underline} will very likely mean
that it will be significantly harder for a state to satisfy the factors
of immediacy and necessity required to lawfully exercise its right of
self-defense.

[[Cyberspace is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a realm where traditional
notions of deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[break down.
D]{.mark}eterring a threat by issuing counter-threats to deliver a
devastating response to any cyber attack against]{.underline} the United
States and its [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies [[may seem like an
attractive solution]{.underline}]{.mark} to the cyber security
challenge. The high costs associated with defending networks from cyber
intrusions and the relatively low costs of launching a cyber attack have
led many to analogize cyber deterrence to nuclear deterrence.31
[[However, cyber attacks lack the stable footprint]{.mark} of
conventional military forces. The fact that terrorist [attacks **do not
leave a "return address**]{.mark}**"** is accentuated in the case of
**cyber warfare**. [In the case of a cyber attack]{.mark}]{.underline},
for example, [[even tracking down the specific
computer]{.underline}]{.mark} from which an attack was launched [[might
not give the attacked country sufficient information]{.mark} to
distinguish whether a country, terrorist group, or rogue individual
launched an attack]{.underline} from that particular computer. [These
concerns]{.underline}, in part, [are why]{.underline} U.S. Deputy
[Secretary of Defense]{.underline} William Lynn recently [stated that
denying adversaries access to U.S. information systems]{.underline} in
the first place, [rather than planning to retaliate]{.underline} in case
of an attack, [encompasses the bulk of U.S. defensive
efforts]{.underline}.32 The United States and its
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} partners must invest heavily in defending
their networks from intrusion and [[cannot be confident that
maintaining]{.mark} nascent [retaliatory capabilities will suffice to
deter attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, while strong cyber ties
between NATO members might not ensure that deterrence succeeds, weak
cyber ties will almost certainly encourage adversaries to launch more
cyber incursions against NATO members.33 Finally, since many future wars
will likely include major cyber components, thinking about cyberspace as
a very separate sphere of warfare delinked from other areas of conflict
is counterproductive.34

Cyberspace is a relatively new and poorly understood domain of human
activity. Despite the potential for expression, exchange of knowledge,
and creation, it quickly became another area for human conflict. These
conflicts range from the petty to major state competition for power and
resources[. To explore the likelihood of deterrence providing some level
of stability and peace, this monograph examined three different cyber
attacks]{.underline}, the ability for the victims to attribute the
attack, the response chosen, and the effect on future cyber attacks.

[Across the three different incidents, there are different dynamics at
work. [The DDoS attack against Estonia]{.mark} was a low-grade nuisance,
whose broad attack base [supported plausible

Retrieved 6/15/2022)

The three smartest words that Donald Trump uttered during his
presidential campaign are "[[NATO is obsolete]{.underline}."]{.mark} His
adversary, Hillary Clinton, retorted that NATO was "the strongest
military alliance in the history of the world." Now that Trump has been
in power, the White House parrots the same worn line that NATO is "the
most successful Alliance in history, guaranteeing the security,
prosperity, and freedom of its members." But Trump was right the first
time around: Rather than being a strong alliance with a clear purpose,
[[this 70-year-old organization]{.underline}]{.mark} that is meeting in
London on December 4 [[is a stale military holdover from the Cold War
days]{.underline}]{.mark} that should have gracefully retired many years
ago. NATO was originally founded by the United States and 11 other
Western nations as an attempt to curb the rise of communism in 1949. Six
years later, Communist nations founded the Warsaw Pact and through these
two multilateral institutions, the entire globe became a Cold War
battleground. When the USSR collapsed in 1991, the Warsaw Pact disbanded
but NATO expanded, growing from its original 12 members to 29 member
countries. North Macedonia, set to join next year, will bring the number
to 30. NATO has also expanded well beyond the North Atlantic, adding a
partnership with Colombia in 2017. Donald Trump recently suggested that
Brazil could one day become a full member. NATO's post-Cold War
expansion toward Russia's borders, despite earlier promises not to move
eastward, has led to rising tensions between Western powers and Russia,
including multiple close calls between military forces. It has also
contributed to a new arms race, including upgrades in nuclear arsenals,
and the largest NATO "war games" since the Cold War. [[While claiming to
"preserve peace," NATO has a history of bombing civilians and committing
war crimes]{.underline}.]{.mark} In 1999, NATO engaged in military
operations without UN approval in Yugoslavia. Its illegal airstrikes
during the Kosovo War left hundreds of civilians dead. And far from the
"North Atlantic," NATO joined the United States in invading Afghanistan
in 2001, where it is still bogged down two decades later. In 2011, NATO
forces illegally invaded Libya, creating a failed state that caused
masses of people to flee. Rather than take responsibility for these
refugees, NATO countries have turned back desperate migrants on the
Mediterranean Sea, letting thousands die. In London, NATO wants to show
it is ready to fight new wars. It will showcase its readiness
initiative---the ability to deploy 30 battalions by land, 30 air
squadrons and 30 naval vessels in just 30 days, and to confront future
threats from China and Russia, including with hypersonic missiles and
cyberwarfare. But far from being a lean, mean war machine, [[NATO
is]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [[riddled with divisions and
contradictions]{.underline}.]{.mark} Here are some of them: French
President Emmanuel Macron questions the U.S. commitment to fight for
Europe, has called NATO "brain dead" and has proposed a European Army
under the nuclear umbrella of France. Turkey has enraged NATO members
with its incursion into Syria to attack the Kurds, who have been Western
allies in the fight against ISIS. And Turkey has threatened to veto a
Baltic defense plan until allies support its controversial incursion
into Syria. Turkey has also infuriated NATO members, especially Trump,
by purchasing Russia's S-400 missile system. Trump wants NATO to push
back against China's growing influence, including the use of Chinese
companies for the construction of 5G mobile networks---something many
NATO countries are unwilling to do. Is Russia really NATO's adversary?
France's Macron has reached out to Russia, inviting Putin to discuss
ways in which the European Union can put the Crimean invasion behind it.
Donald Trump has publicly attacked Germany over its Nord Stream 2
project to pipe in Russian gas, but a recent German poll saw 66 percent
wanting closer ties with Russia. The UK has bigger problems. Britain has
been convulsed over the Brexit conflict and is holding a contentious
national election on December 12. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson,
knowing that Trump is wildly unpopular, is reluctant to be seen as close
to him. Also, Johnson's major contender, Jeremy Corbyn, is a reluctant
supporter of NATO. While his Labour Party is committed to NATO, over his
career as an anti-war champion, Corbyn has called NATO "a danger to
world peace and a danger to world security." The last time Britain
hosted NATO leaders in 2014, Corbyn told an anti-NATO rally that the end
of the Cold War "should have been the time for NATO to shut up shop,
give up, go home and go away." A further complication is Scotland, which
is home to a very unpopular Trident nuclear submarine base as part of
NATO's nuclear deterrent. A new Labour government would need the support
of the Scottish National Party. But its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, insists
that a precondition for her party's support is a commitment to close the
base. Europeans can't stand Trump (a recent poll found he is trusted by
only 4 percent of Europeans!) and their leaders can't rely on him.
Allied leaders learn of presidential decisions that affect their
interests via Twitter. The lack of coordination was clear in October,
when Trump ignored NATO allies when he ordered U.S. special forces out
of northern Syria, where they had been operating alongside French and
British commandos against Islamic State militants. The U.S.
unreliability has led the European Commission to draw up plans for a
European "defense union" that will coordinate military spending and
procurement. The next step may be to coordinate military actions
separate from NATO. The Pentagon has complained about EU countries
purchasing military equipment from each other instead of from the United
States, and has called this defense union "a dramatic reversal of the
last three decades of increased integration of the transatlantic defence
sector." Do Americans really want to go to war for Estonia? Article 5 of
the Treaty states that an attack against one member "shall be considered
an attack against them all," meaning that the treaty obligates the U.S.
to go to war on behalf of 28 nations---something most likely opposed by
war-weary Americans who want a less aggressive foreign policy that
focuses on peace, diplomacy, and economic engagement instead of military
force. An additional major bone of contention is who will pay for NATO.
The last time NATO leaders met, President Trump derailed the agenda by
berating NATO countries for not paying their fair share, and at the
London meeting, Trump is expected to announce symbolic U.S. cuts to
NATO's operations budget. Trump's main concern is that member states
step up to the NATO target of spending 2 percent of their gross domestic
products on defense by 2024, a goal that is unpopular among Europeans,
who prefer that their tax dollars go to nonmilitary items. Nevertheless,
NATOSecretary-General Jens Stoltenberg will brag that Europe and Canada
have added \$100 billion to their military budgets since
2016---something Donald Trump will take credit for---and that more NATO
officials are meeting the 2 percent goal, even though a 2019 NATO report
shows only seven members have done so: the U.S., Greece, Estonia, the
UK, Romania, Poland and Latvia. [[In an age where people around the
world want to avoid war]{.underline}]{.mark} and to focus instead on the
climate chaos that threatens future life on earth, [[NATO is an
anachronism]{.underline}]{.mark}. It now accounts for about
three-quarters of military spending and weapons dealing around the
globe. [[Instead of preventing war, it promotes militarism, exacerbates
global tensions and makes war more likely]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
Cold War relic shouldn't be reconfigured to maintain U.S. domination in
Europe, or to mobilize against Russia or China, or to launch new wars in
space. It should not be expanded, but disbanded. Seventy years of
militarism is more than enough.

[[Despite endless searches for a new mission to justify its massive
burden on U.S. taxpayers, NATO has failed to be of much use since
then]{.underline}]{.mark}. As its boosters like to remind us, after
9/11, the alliance invoked its Article 5 mutual-defense provision on our
behalf. But action from America's allies did not follow the grandiose
gesture---the NATO mission in Afghanistan relied mostly on U.S. forces
and effectively failed. Today, the alliance's bureaucrats and some
member states spotlight a threat from Russia as a reason for keeping the
organization alive, along with a laundry list of "train and equip"
missions. Yet NATO members\' defense budgets don\'t reflect a real sense
of danger from Russia or anyone else. Among the twenty-nine members,
only the United States is really serious about its Article 3 obligations
to defend itself, spending approximately \$700 billion or 3.5 percent of
its GDP on defense. No other NATO member comes close to this proportion,
and the vast majority fail even to meet the modest, self-imposed
requirement to devote at least 2 percent of GDP to defense. Britain and
Poland are rare members that meet the 2 percent requirement. One of the
worst free-riders is Canada, which spends just 1 percent of its GDP on
security, amounting to \$20 billion. Furthermore, Germany spends a
similarly pathetic 1.2 percent. Compare that to non-NATO members facing
real threats, some of which spend 5-10 percent of their GDPs on defense.
These include Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who must
contend with Iran and spend nearly a combined \$100 billion. Israel,
which faces the same enemy, adds \$15 billion to the equation. Despite
protestations of poverty at a time when their economies have never been
larger, NATO members are more than willing to rack up additional
liabilities, knowing America has their back. Last year, the alliance
welcomed Montenegro. It is now poised to admit the Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, which would mean the United States is pledged to
defend a nation that devotes just \$120 million per year to its own
defense, not quite as much as the Cincinnati Police Department. But
[[the reality is there is no truly capable Russian foe seriously
threatening the West. Russia has one million uniformed personnel in its
military]{.underline}]{.mark}, the world's second-largest behind
America, [[but the E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion [[could easily afford to match that with
its combined \$17 trillion economy---ten times larger than
Russia's.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, it needn't bother as Moscow
spends just \$61 billion on its overwrought military, which doubles as
an employment program. Russia's Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} has gotten
the most from Russia's military, occupying parts of Georgia and Ukraine
and gaining influence in Syria by backing the Assad regime. Still, his
[[success]{.underline}]{.mark} in all three cases rested heavily on
surprises that Moscow [[seems unlikely to be able to repeat against
prepared and adequately funded European militaries]{.underline}.]{.mark}
Yer we should expect to hear none of this nuance at the NATO summit, as
poohbahs of the dying old European political order gather to tut-tut
President Trump in the alliance's fancy new \$1.4 billion headquarters,
funded predominantly by American taxpayers. To get out of this abusive
relationship, Trump should begin the process of limiting America\'s role
in NATO. A good model is that of Sweden, which cooperates with NATO on
some matters and not on others. Such an approach could allow joint
training, but end the practice of having over-burdened U.S. taxpayers
foot the bill for wealthy Europeans\' security. As part of this plan,
Trump could mothball U.S. bases in Europe and shift most resources spent
there and in the Atlantic to the Indo-Pacific region, where China and
Iran pose real threats to America---and against which NATO is
irrelevant. [[Europe is prosperous and treats America like a patsy. Let
it stand on its own.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The United States sent its European allies some stern signals about
their obligations to the American-led international order last week. On
Monday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power visited Brussels,
where she warned NATO members to halt their "dangerous" defense cuts and
called on European powers to offer more troops to United Nations peace
operations. Power argued that [European armies]{.underline}, which
[currently provide **less than 10 percent** of all]{.underline} U.N.
[peacekeepers]{.underline} worldwide, could have a "momentum-shifting"
impact on beleaguered blue helmet missions in trouble spots such as
South Sudan. Instead, she underlined, "European countries have drawn
back from peacekeeping," while the **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**uropean
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion [has [**shied away** from]{.mark}
high-intensity [missions]{.mark}]{.underline}. This was an accurate but
uncomfortable message for [EU and NATO members]{.underline}, whose
[[appetite]{.mark} for stabilization missions [remains **very
low**]{.mark}]{.underline} after their Afghan nightmares. Power
emphasized threats from the Middle East and North Africa to bolster her
argument. Later in the week, anonymous U.S. officials sent a reminder
that they expect European assistance in Asia, too. This time, the sore
point was economic cooperation rather than military affairs. Washington
has taken umbrage at Britain's decision to invest in the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a new organization proposed by
China to offset the U.S.-backed Asian Development Bank. A U.S. source
told the Financial Times that [the U.K. seemed to be adopting a stance
of "constant accommodation of China."]{.underline} British journalists
seemed shocked that the U.S. might question Washington's "special
relationship" with London. [In reality, the [relations]{.mark}hip [has
been **on the rocks**]{.mark} for some time, as]{.underline} U.S.
President Barack [Obama]{.underline}'s administration has [worked out
thorny but productive alternative relationships with Paris and Berlin on
political, security and economic matters]{.underline}. [Yet the U.S.
criticism]{.underline} of the U.K. involvement with the AIIB [revealed a
deeper concern about potential challenges to U.S. leadership in the
international system---and Europe's commitment to sustaining American
primacy in particular]{.underline}. The current multilateral system
rests on two basic pillars. The first of these is a U.S. political
commitment to work through international institutions, even if this is
often more a matter of rhetoric than reality. The second is the
continued willingness of Western European governments and Japan to pay a
large chunk of the costs of this system, in addition to backing the U.S.
against challengers such as Russia and China. This has never been an
entirely stable set-up. It has most obviously broken down over
individual crises such as the 2003 Iraq War, when France and Germany
lined up with China and Russia to oppose the U.S.-led invasion. More
fundamentally, it has been clear ever since the long process of
decolonization brought waves of Asian and African states into the U.N.
and other international institutions in the 1950s and 1960s that the
"global order" could not rest on a trans-Atlantic bargain indefinitely.
[[It]{.mark} has [nonetheless proved]{.mark} to be a **[remarkably
durable]{.mark}** arrangement]{.underline}. The U.S., EU members and
Japan combined continue to pay nearly 80 percent of the U.N.'s main
budget. Their shared grip on the institution remains powerful.
Non-Western powers have invested in elements of the international
system: China has aimed to expand its limited role in the International
Monetary Fund, while Arab countries have focused on humanitarian aid in
response to the crises in their neighborhood. But the overall U.S. and
European dominance of these institutions is extremely hard to break.
[The benefits to Western policymakers are also clear]{.underline}.
Non-Western officials at the IMF believe that the fund has been far too
deferential to the EU over the eurozone crisis, even if the European
Commission has at the same time argued that the IMF has been unduly
critical of EU efforts. In the meantime, close observers of the U.N.
believe that Britain, France and the U.S. are now actually more powerful
in the Security Council than they were 10 to 15 years ago, despite
collisions with Russia and China over matters such as Syria, as they
have consolidated their powers to draft resolutions and control the
organization's peace operations and sanctions regimes. The Obama
administration, with its emphasis on building relations with non-Western
powers, seemed intent on challenging this state of affairs. It did so to
some extent in its early years. Washington ganged up with Asian
governments in the G-20 to impose IMF reforms that were meant to reduce
European leverage in the organization, although the measures have
subsequently been held up in the U.S. Congress. Obama's team also tried
to show greater sensitivity to Russia's positions on crises like Syria
than previous U.S. administrations. But [the U.S. has **failed** to
re-engineer international cooperation. Russia remains obstreperous, and
China seems more interested in developing new
organizations]{.underline}, such as the AIIB, [than investing in
existing U.S.-led bodies]{.underline}. Episodes such as the 2011 Libyan
war, when Beijing and Moscow waved through the Western intervention and
then went on to slam it, have left doubts about the chances of putting
international institutions on a new political footing. [Having looked
for better partners elsewhere, **the U.S. is stuck with
Europe**]{.underline}. [And yet Europeans seem to be **distinctly
reluctant** to play along]{.underline}. NATO countries appear likely to
respond to Power's plea and do a bit more for peacekeeping in the near
future, as the Netherlands and Nordic countries have recently done in
Mali. But [[**"stay at home-ism"** is]{.mark} still [a credible]{.mark}
power [doctrine]{.mark} for some members of the alliance.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, [[most]{.mark} EU members]{.underline}, with honorable
exceptions such as Sweden and the U.K., [[**severely cut**
their]{.underline}]{.mark} development and humanitarian
[[budgets]{.mark} during the financial crisis]{.underline}. In economic
terms, no EU member can afford to ignore China's wealth and markets. [So
the [Eu]{.mark}ropean [pillar]{.mark} of the international system [looks
**very weak**]{.mark} indeed. [This does **not** mean]{.mark} that [it
is about to crack. Europe]{.mark}an policymakers [are **not about to
dump Washington**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and they still take its
criticisms to heart, as the attention given to Power's speech
demonstrates. If China's ambassador to the U.N. gave a speech in
Brussels, it would very likely go unnoticed. [But]{.underline} the U.S.
has to assume that, at best, [European governments are going to be less
consistent and predictable supporters of the]{.underline} post-1945
[multilateral system---and that]{.underline} the [system]{.underline} as
a whole [will suffer as a result]{.underline}.

Cyberspace as a domain of operations

Since the [[Allies recognised cyber]{.mark}space [as a **domain of
op**]{.mark}**erations**]{.underline} in 2016, [NATO]{.underline} has
[[achieved]{.mark} several **[important
milestones]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Perhaps most notably, in October
2018, [NATO announced the]{.underline} initial [stand up of the
**Cyberspace Operations Centre**]{.underline}, or CyOC, in its trial
structure. [[The CyOC serves as NATO's **theatre component**]{.mark} for
cyberspace and]{.underline} is responsible for providing [cyberspace
**situational awareness**, **centralised planning** for]{.underline} the
cyberspace aspects of [Alliance operations]{.underline} and missions,
[[and **coordination** for cyberspace **operational
concerns**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Along with this critical organisational adaptation, [[Allies
**agreed**]{.underline}]{.mark} at the Brussels Summit [[how to
**integrate**]{.mark} sovereign cyber effects, provided **voluntarily**
by Allies, into Alliance **operations** and **missions**. This is
**fully coherent** with NATO's **defensive mandate**, as it aligns how
NATO **defends itself in cyberspace** as]{.underline} it does [in other
domains]{.underline}, with Allies contributing tanks, planes, and ships
to Alliance operations and missions.

[[**Strategy** and **guidance** is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[maturing]{.underline}]{.mark}. In June 2018, [Allies **approved** the
**V**ision and **S**trategy on **C**yberspace as a **D**omain of
**O**perations]{.underline}. It is anticipated that, in 2019, NATO's
first cyberspace operations doctrine will be completed, subject to
Allied approval, which will provide guidance to NATO commanders.

These structures and concepts are only of value if implemented and put

### 1NC \-\-- Hybrid Ward D

**NATO response will always be proportional**

**NBC 10** \-\-- NBC News, Red Tape, "Could cyber skirmish lead U.S. to
war?", June 2010,
https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/could-cyber-skirmish-lead-u-s-war-flna6C10406234

[[Imagine]{.underline}]{.mark} this scenario:
[[Estonia]{.underline}]{.mark}, a NATO member, [is cut off from the
Internet by cyber attackers]{.underline} who besiege the country\'s
bandwidth with a devastating denial of service attack. Then, the
nation\'s power grid is attacked, threatening economic disruption and
even causing loss of life as emergency services are overwhelmed. As
international outcry swells, outside researchers determine the attack is
being sponsored by a foreign government and being directed from a
military base. Desperate and outgunned in tech resources, [Estonia
[invokes Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline} of the NATO Treaty \-- an attack
against one member nation is an attack against all. It requests an
immediate response from its military allies: [Bomb the attacker\'s
command-and-control headquarters [to stop]{.mark} the punishing [cyber
attack.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Now, the U.S. government is faced with a chilling question: Should it
get dragged into a shooting war by a cyber attack on an ally? Or should
it decline and threaten the fiber of the NATO alliance?]{.underline}

About [[half this fictional scenario **occurred**]{.mark} **in
2007**]{.underline}, [when Estonian]{.underline} government and
[financial Web sites]{.underline} [were]{.underline} ~~crippled~~
\[[knocked out\] by a cyber attack]{.underline} during a dispute [with
Russia]{.underline}. **[That incident [never
escalated]{.mark}]{.underline}** to this hypothetic level, however: The
source of the attack was unclear, physical harm did not occur and
**[[Estonia never invoked Article 5.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The incident did, however, get other NATO members thinking: When would
they be required to rise to the defense of an ally during a cyber
attack?

Last year, a working group led by former U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright was formed by NATO to study the future of the alliance
in a post Cold War world. When the group issued its report last month,
aimed at helping NATO form a new \"Strategic Concept,\" the thorny
issues raised by cyber war were listed as one of the three toughest
challenges facing the alliance. NATO is expected to approve the
Strategic Concept this November during a meeting in Lisbon, and cyber
war issues will be hotly debated.

[Mutual defense is the heart of the NATO alliance]{.underline}, formed
in 1949 in the wake of World War II, largely to combat the aspirations
of an expanding Soviet Union. Article 5 lays out the obligations of
members in plain language:

\"The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
of them \... will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.\"

[Despite all the attention [Article 5]{.mark} has received]{.underline}
during the 60-plus years of NATO, [it [has been invoked only
once]{.mark} \-- after the 9/11 attacks]{.underline}. That led to an
alliance attack to remove the Taliban from power in Afghanistan.

[That means [the odds of a]{.mark} rudimentary]{.underline} botnet
[[attack]{.mark} against a NATO member [leading to
war]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[are quite small]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
They are not zero, however. The Albright group\'s report, titled \"NATO
2020,\" was stark in its assessment \-- ignoring the issue would
probably only encourage attackers.

\"The next significant attack on the Alliance may well come down a fiber
optic cable,\" it reads. \"A cyber attack that leads to chaos in one
city may inspire copy-cat criminals in another. Due to the reach of
modern media, even terrorist groups and pirate bands now have public
relations specialists and NATO, when and wherever it acts (or fails to
act), will do so with a global audience.\"

Among the report\'s recommendations(PDF): Give NATO military leaders
pre-delegated authority to respond \"in an emergency situation such as a
missile or cyber attack.\"

\'What is the threshold for crossing the cyber line?\'

Roger Cressey, a former member of the U.S. National Security Council,
said there is a long list of unanswered questions that NATO hasn\'t
begun to resolve.

\"If there is a cyber attack, does NATO respond in kind? Do the NATO
allies with the most advanced cyber capabilities respond on behalf of
the member that was attacked?\" wondered Cressey, now a consultant with
Good Harbor Consulting and an NBC analyst. \"Should a response be
limited only to cyberspace or should kinetic options be on the table
too? This raises some very important issues \-- do you attack another
country with missiles and aircraft in response to a cyber attack? What
is the threshold for crossing the cyber line and into physical
responses?\"

An even thornier issue, he said, is \"attack attribution.\" As was the
case of the Estonian attacks and more recent attacks on Google and other
big tech companies, it\'s often difficult to positively identify
cyber-attackers. So foreign governments or other enemies can easily
blame cyber attacks on rogue groups.

\"Doctrine on cyber attack is a very problematic issue, one that the
Pentagon is struggling with right now,\" Cressey said. \"If individual
countries haven\'t figured it out yet, then it\'s a guarantee that
collective defense entities like NATO will be even further behind in
coming up with an agreed upon approach.\"

NATO lawyer: A high bar

Lawyer [Eneken Tikk]{.underline} is in a unique position to understand
the nuances of the Article 5 mutual defense debate. She is [[the]{.mark}
acting [policy chief at]{.mark} a [NATO]{.mark} training center called
the Cooperative [Cyber Defence Centre]{.mark} of Excellence in Tallinn,
Estonia]{.underline}, which was founded in 2008 in the wake of the 2007
cyber attack. She [[believes]{.mark} there is undoubtedly a legal basis
for a mutual defense response to a cyber attack]{.underline} \-- **[but
[the threshold for invoking]{.mark}]{.underline}** such a response
**[[is very high]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For starters, she said, [mere
electronic disruptions]{.underline} probably **[wouldn\'t clear the
bar]{.underline}**. [Involving other NATO nations would require \"a
cyber attack]{.underline} on a country\'s power networks or critical
infrastructure (**[that) resulted in casualties]{.underline}** and
destruction **[comparable to an armed attack,\"]{.underline}** she said.

**[And even casualties might not trigger treaty
obligations]{.underline}**, she said.

\"There is no clear threshold of a cyber armed attack - and even a
kinetic attack is not always what the U.N. Charter considers as a
threshold for invoking the right to individual (or collective)
self-defense,\" she said. She pointed to research that suggests an
attack \"has to be of enough scope, duration and intensity \... to
satisfy the accepted criteria of an armed attack under international
law.\" [Neither an overnight border skirmish nor a troublesome but
temporary denial of service]{.underline} attack [would
qualify]{.underline}, she suggested. **[[That why]{.mark} the
[Estonia]{.mark}n government [did not invoke]{.mark} Article 5 in 2007,
she said.]{.underline}**

The Albright report makes allowances for all these gray areas, but hints
at a formula it suggests could be put in place to arrive at more
delicate decisions.

\"There is, of course, nothing ambiguous about a cross border military
assault by the combined armed forces of a hostile country,\" it said.
\"However, there may well be doubts about whether an unconventional
danger \-- such as a cyber attack or evidence that terrorists are
planning a strike \-- triggers the collective defense mechanisms of
Article 5. In the event, this will have to be determined by the \...
nature, source, scope and other aspects of the particular security
challenge.\"

\'Can a cyber attack invoke a physical response?\'

Mark Rasch, former head of the Justice Department\'s computer crimes
unit and now a consultant at Secure IT Experts, said that NATO\'s
attempt to clarify members\' obligations during cyber attack is further
complicated by the fact that low[-level [cyber attacks are happening
**constantly**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Some are better described as
espionage or spying than cyber war, and many come from corporations or
curious kids. On the other hand, some of those \"curious kids\" are
state-sponsored, he said.

\"We\'ve been having low-level cyber **[for 30 years]{.underline}**,\"
Rasch said. \"There\'s been penetration testing, Web defacements, denial
of service attacks, propaganda attacks. But we haven\'t yet had a cyber
attack where a nation-state mobilizes to attack the critical
infrastructure of another nation.\"

**Hybrid deterrence high**

Deterrence by denial (i.e., an ability to deny Russian objectives by
defensive measures) is only possible for NATO at the lower rungs of this
ladder, and NATO has not been idle here either. In fact, most of the
early [measures taken by NATO]{.underline} in response to the annexation
of Crimea [fall into the deterrence of denial category and centre on
rapid reaction capacities,]{.underline} especially in the shape of a
NATO Response Force (NRF) upgraded for deterrence purposes. [The NRF now
has a **reinforced**, quicker spearhead---a Very High Readiness Joint
Task Force potentially up to 13,000 troops strong, and then two
complementing brigades with support]{.underline} (each 13,000 strong)
[forming a layered, sizeable reaction force explicitly linked to
**collective defence** purposes]{.underline} and regularly exercised in
Eastern Europe and the Baltic states.35 [In 2016, in response to the
foreseeable difficulties of projecting mainly Western forces into zones
of conflicts close to Russia, NATO decided to established an "enhanced
forward presence"---]{.underline}four multinational battalion-sized
battle groups ---[in the Baltic states and Poland]{.underline}, and a
"tailored forward presence"---mainly naval forces---in the Black Sea
region. Whether these forces can credibly "deny" Russian objectives in
the case of limited war is a bone of contention. [Most observers and
sometimes NATO itself employ the descriptor "tripwire" to these
forces]{.underline}, thus [indicating that they are triggers that
promise to unleash NATO's big guns]{.underline} and therefore part and
parcel of deterrence by punishment. However, [US
[diplomats]{.mark}]{.underline} (interviewed on background) feel more
[[confident]{.underline}]{.mark} that the US battalion embedded (in
Poland) in [the [collective forward presence posture
would]{.mark}]{.underline} actually [be able to fight and survive, and
thus **[deny Russian objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That may be so,
in which case the conclusion is that NATO has a moderate-to-low---and
geographically focused---capacity for deterrence by denial and then a
more general and impressive capacity for deterrence by punishment.
[[NATO's **unquestionable capacity for deterrence**]{.mark} by denial is
rather found [at the **level of grey zone**]{.mark}, non-kinetic
[conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this regard, [[NATO has
**upgraded**]{.mark} not only [its **cyber defences** and enhanced
intelligence coordination]{.mark}, as mentioned, but has **enhanced
coordination** with the European Union [on hybrid
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with a 2016 joint declaration leading to
a common work program and a collaborative Centre of Excellence for
Countering Hybrid Threats]{.underline}, located in Helsinki, the 2016
adoption of societal resilience benchmarks that, while mostly falling
outside NATO's political-military remit, nations must meet, and finally
the decision in 2018 to [[organize counter-hybrid support teams]{.mark}
that [can tailor assistance]{.mark} to individual allies and
circumstances]{.underline}.36 NATO's full range of actions in response
to Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea ---a range to which this brief
overview can do only limited justice---thus combines deterrence by
denial (grey zone conflict, societal resilience, reaction and forward
deployed forces to counter limited land grabs) and deterrence by
punishment (the full chain of reaction and deployable forces, from
conventional to nuclear). [[NATO's]{.mark} strong suit is the military
piece of this posture, but it [has considerably adapted to grey zone
conflict scenarios]{.mark} in an effort [to achieve]{.mark} a
**[comprehensive deterrence]{.mark}** posture vis-à-vis Russia's
unified]{.underline} (kinetic and non-kinetic) [and
uninterrupted]{.underline} (all domains, in war and peace) [doctrine of
"new generation warfare".]{.underline}

**Hybrid war doesn't spillover to kinetic conflict**

National Defence University, 2/3/19, "The Hidden Benefits of Great-Power
Conflict with China and Russia,"

[The fact [that]{.mark}]{.underline} practically [all serious [security
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} facing the West [have [**moved to the gray
zone** is]{.mark} a **[positive]{.mark} thing**. [This
means]{.mark}]{.underline} that [most---if not
[all---threats]{.mark}]{.underline} that the western states are
confronting [[are **nonmilitary**]{.underline}]{.mark} in nature.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} development [has [reduced]{.mark} the
[probability of war]{.mark}]{.underline} breaking out [between western
states and their adversaries]{.underline}. This is a new development as
many western states have overused their militaries during the post--Cold
War era to the detriment of other tools of statecraft.

"[**Gray-zone conflicts**," "**hybrid warfare**," "political warfare"
and "competition short of armed conflict" have become mainstream ways to
frame]{.underline} and conceptualize [contemporary threats]{.underline}
facing the United States and its allies and partners in Europe. The
western outlook to gray-zone conflicts accentuates daily dangers which
over time corrode western shared understandings, narratives and
institutions. [According to the western reading]{.underline} of the
situation, the [tools at the disposal of]{.underline} today's [gray-zone
actors vary from **info**rmation **war**fare]{.underline} specialists
[to internet troll farms and offensive cyber actors]{.underline}.

One key theme which unites many gray-zone conflict oracles is the focus
on nonmilitary tools with malign intent. As the Secretary-General on
NATO Jens Stoltenberg noted already in 2015, "Hybrid is the dark
reflection of our comprehensive approach. We use a combination of
military and nonmilitary means to stabilize countries. Others use it to
destabilize them." As Stoltenberg noted in his speech, the [combination
of military and nonmilitary tools to advance one's interests dates back
thousands of years. Why]{.underline}, then, [are we so
surprised]{.underline} by the fact [that Russia and
China]{.underline}---and perhaps some other significant actors as
well---[are]{.underline} conceptualizing, formulating and [executing
their security strategies in a way that assigns importance to military
and nonmilitary tools?]{.underline} Moreover, [how come we are
surprised]{.underline} by the fact that the [**overt use of military
force** is seen by Russia and China something that **should be
avoided?**]{.underline} Isn't it smart for any actor to achieve its
goals without recourse to the use of large-scale violence? [[Being able
to achieve]{.mark} one's [goals]{.mark} with diplomatic, information,
economic, financial, intelligence and law enforcement tools
[without]{.mark} the use of [military force]{.mark}]{.underline}---using
all other means than the military within the DIMEFIL model---is a result
that [**[should be commended]{.mark}**. It is a goal]{.underline} that
[any smart actor within the international system should strive to
do]{.underline}.

[Today's international system is competitive]{.underline}. This is a
fact. [But it has been **competitive for almost all known history of
human beings**]{.underline} and the social groups they have formed. From
an international security perspective, the two decades of the post--Cold
War era---roughly between 1989/1991--2013---were an extraordinary time.
During this period the West---North America and Europe---faced no
serious security threats in the military or nonmilitary spheres. It was
a time of "the unipolar moment" and supposedly "the end of history." It
was during this period that an expanding NATO made a paradigm change by
neglecting Article 5 and going out-of-area in search of a new mission.
The United States led the way by going "abroad in search of monsters to
destroy"---from Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia to Afghanistan, Iraq and
Libya. And soon enough, many western states had their hands full of real
hard security threats---if not against the states themselves, at least
against their deployed troops in operations. During this time, in a
matter of two decades, many western states used military force loosely
outside of Europe trying to manage almost irrelevant security problems
with air power, precision weapons, first-class intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technology and---ultimately---by
deploying ground troops for counterinsurgency warfare without clearly
stated political goals or any significant chance of success. For years
sunk costs mattered more than potential future "victory" when western
states deliberated new rotations of forces to these operations. Bosnia,
Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq have defined the western approach to
international security and strategy for more than two decades.
Continuously ongoing warfare, operations and campaigns somewhere "out
there" have become a normal state of affairs---"the new normal" within
the West.

Thus, during the two decades of the immediate post--Cold War era,
western states redefined their take on international politics,
international security and war. This happened at a time, when western
(read: American) power had reached its zenith. This time was really an
aberration in the long history of relations between states.
Unfortunately for the West today, past formulations of security and
military operations were based on shaky---even faulty---foundations.
They were based on wishful thinking and overtly optimistic future
projections about the ability of western states to remain at the top of
the international pecking order of state power without being challenged
by anyone, anywhere at any time. It was during these two decades that
the collective western delusion about the new "rules of the
international security game" emerged. And based on this delusion, many
western states reformulated their defense policies and national military
forces. As we have witnessed during the post--Cold War era, many western
states---led by the United States---have intervened in the affairs of
other states militarily to an unprecedented degree. Many political
problems have been securitized and militarized---seen to require
military responses.

The overtly expansive and even militaristic security policy orientation
that developed and matured within the West during the post--Cold War era
has now collided with very traditional great-power outlook of Russia and
China. Although the [[military power]{.underline}]{.mark} at the
disposal [[of the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates has suffered from almost two decades
of constant warfighting, it [[is]{.mark} still [second to none]{.mark},
and continues to be for a long time]{.underline}. However, the [policies
of Russia and China]{.underline} have [turned out]{.underline} to be [at
odds with the definition of international security]{.underline} that was
[fostered by the western states during the post--Cold War
era]{.underline}. The western-dominated international security agenda is
not accepted by Russia or China. And due to long-term efforts to
strengthen their military forces, Russia and China today need to be
taken seriously. For the West, it is unfortunate that [[the best way for
Russia and China to increase]{.mark} their power position and
[standing]{.mark} in international politics [is to attack the
existing]{.mark} western-generated internationals security
[order]{.mark} and its rules of the game]{.underline}. And [the easiest
way to do this is to use all tools of
statecraft]{.underline}---[although **[scarcely relying on]{.mark} the
use of [military force]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [overt use of
military force reflects the failure to influence others with
other---more "economical" tools]{.underline}.

[**Supposedly**, China and Russia have been]{.underline}
operating---even [waging war---below the radar for years]{.underline}
now. I argue that [many western radars have been **wrongly
calibrated**]{.underline} during the post--Cold War years. It is
precisely the "noise" in international politics that states should be
concerned about. War is---and should be---an aberration. [[Other methods
of statecraft are---and should be---constantly used]{.mark} in order to
achieve politically defined outcomes. Radars calibrated only for
high-intensity military threats and warfare leaves western statesmen
equipped with meager tools to advance their interests]{.underline}.

Much of the western [gray-zone talk has been caused by the
surprise]{.underline} that [Russia's action in Europe and China's
actions in Asia have caused. Suddenly]{.underline}, during the early
years of this decade, [states within the western security community were
not able to define the rules of the international security
system]{.underline} on their own terms. Indeed, the [actions of Russia
and China have made the return of great-power politics]{.underline} very
[visible]{.underline} within the international system. It is
understandable that the [loss of the international pole position has
caused distress]{.underline} and anger [within the West.
But]{.underline} putting things into perspective, [it would be hubristic
to assume]{.underline} that [for an extended period]{.underline} of time
[western states could have exclusive rights to delineate]{.underline}
the logic and [rules of international security]{.underline}. Today it is
obvious that **[the unipolar moment is over. The sooner that this sinks
in, the better]{.underline}**. Realizing this is a prerequisite for
devising policies that can serve western security interests.

The western [[discourse on]{.underline}]{.mark} the negative or
[[threatening]{.underline}]{.mark} aspects of the ongoing [Russian and
Chinese [gray-zone **op**]{.mark}eration[**s** is]{.mark} based on [a
**faulty understanding of statecraft**]{.mark} **or grand
strategy**]{.underline}. After all, grand strategy can be understood as
a "collection of plans and policies that comprise the state's deliberate
effort to harness political, military, diplomatic, and economic tools
together to advance that state's national interest." Grand strategy thus
reconciles aspirations or ends with means. As we have seen during the
last two decades, in most cases the use of military force serves the
national interest poorly. Not only does the use of overt violence
mobilize active resistance, it also practically in all cases also leads
to unintended consequences that are difficult, if not impossible, to
manage. [What we]{.underline} in the West [call gray-zone
conflicts]{.underline} or "hybrid warfare" [is]{.underline}, in fact,
[Russia and China advancing their national interests with
**normal**]{.underline}---albeit not always with benign---**[tools of
statecraft]{.underline}**. The [presupposition that international
relations are always benevolent]{.underline} in nature (as they were for
some years after the end of the Cold War---at least for the western
states), [and that great powers]{.underline} of the day [refrain from
using malign tools of statecraft]{.underline} when seeking to fulfill
their national objectives [would be **naïve at best---dangerous at
worst**. We should be **pleased**]{.underline} with the fact that
[[China and Russia are]{.underline}]{.mark} highly [[focused]{.mark}
on]{.underline} the [**tools [below warfare]{.mark}**[. This **makes
war**]{.mark} **between Russia or China and the West [more
unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, **[gray-zone competition is a
good thing]{.underline}**. Competition is a normal feature of
international politics.

**No military response**

The Role of Military Means

First and foremost, the role of military means in deterring or defending
against hybrid attacks is still not fully understood. [[If]{.mark}
certain [hybrid actions]{.mark} such as cyberattacks, "fake news"
campaigns or interference in elections are to [become]{.mark} a
[permanent]{.mark} component of interstate competition, [the role
of]{.mark} military [deterrence is **likely**]{.mark} to **remain
[small]{.mark}**. Military means would serve primarily to ensure that a
hybrid conflict does not turn into a military
conflagration]{.underline}. If, on the other hand, hybrid attacks were
only a precursor to a military attack, as was the case in Ukraine in
2014, the defender might have to deploy his military assets
earlier.\[3\] While [[it]{.mark} may [seem **unlikely**]{.mark} that
[NATO would respond **kinetically** to a hybrid, **non-kinetic**
attack]{.mark}]{.underline} and thus be the first to cross the threshold
of using armed force, it is important that allies have a firmer grasp of
the military and non-military response options. Determining when and how
to respond to a hybrid campaign may well turn out to be one of NATO's
toughest challenges in the years ahead. In any case, the mere assertion
that more military muscle also produces more deterrence against hybrid
warfare is clearly insufficient.

### Ext \-\-- Hybrid War D

**Hybrid tactics [fail]{.underline}**

**Lanoska 20** \[Alexander Lanoszka, Assistant Professor of
International Relations at the University of Waterloo, \"Thank goodness
for NATO enlargement\", 4/7/20,
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41311-020-00234-8.pdf\]

[[Even]{.mark} the use of so-called **[hybrid tactics]{.mark}** may
[have **limited efficacy**]{.mark} in the Baltic region]{.underline}.
The [three Baltic countries have been subject to an intense Russian
disinformation campaign since at least 2014. **Nevertheless**, [local
public opinion]{.mark} remains **[largely supportive of NATO]{.mark}**
and other defense policy measures aimed at boosting
deterrence]{.underline}. [One reason why these [societies]{.mark} may be
[inoculated against Russian disinformation]{.mark} is that they have
[gr**own accustomed to seeing Russia in adversarial terms,**]{.mark}
thus [making]{.mark} average [citizens **critical** of pro-Kremlin
narratives]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lanoszka 2019). In addition, [the
[Baltic states]{.mark} have **[integrated]{.mark} their [minority
populations]{.mark}** far better than is often assumed.]{.underline}
Although [many Russophones may still lack citizenship rights in Estonia
and Latvia and so are more likely to experience political discrimination
and economic hardship, they nevertheless retain key benefits associated
with living in the European]{.underline} Union (Trimbach and O'Lear
2015). [They may have [sympathies]{.mark} for aspects of Russian foreign
policy, but these sympathies [**do not translate** into]{.mark} a
[preference to be **reunited with Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kallas
2016). Accordingly, [[Russia faces]{.mark} serious [obstacles
**replicating**]{.mark} **what it did in [Crimea]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Russians]{.mark} living [in]{.mark} [Crimea]{.mark} were generally
[sympathetic to being part of]{.mark} Russkiy Mir ('[Russian
World']{.mark}), [making them]{.mark} more [willing to be]{.mark} the
[objects of]{.mark} an [annexation]{.mark} effort]{.underline}
(O'Loughlin, Toal, and Kolosov 2016, 761). Further, [[Russia does not
have]{.mark} an **existing [military presence]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[Baltic countries]{.mark}---as it did with the Black Sea Fleet stationed
in Sevastopol---that it could leverage to achieve easy faits accomplis
and dissuade potential challengers from organizing]{.underline}.

In sum, [[NATO does not need]{.mark} to have [a heavy footprint]{.mark}
in the Baltic region [to **deter Russian
aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia would have to overcome major
operational challenges if it wished to undertake a successful conquest
of the Baltic countries.]{.underline} Of course, none of this is to
invite complacency about Baltic security. The Baltic states and Poland
should deepen regional cooperation in order to ensure that no key policy
differences exist between them (Jermalavicius et al. 2018). They also
face potential vulnerabilities at sea and so need to improve the
resilience of their undersea and maritime infrastructure (Schaub et al.
2017). Still, [the **[defensibility]{.mark}** of the Baltic region helps
[illuminate why Russia **resorts to disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation

### 1NC \-\-- Democracy D

#### Democracy resilient but doesn't solve

RETHINKING THE VALUE OF DEMOCRACY", First Online: 22 July 2018, Page

The value of democracy has been taken for granted until recently, but
this assumption seems to be under threat now more than ever before. As
was explained in Chapter 1, democracy's claim to be valuable does not
rest on just one particular merit, and scholars tend to distinguish
three different types of values (Sen 1999). This book focused on the
instrumental value of democracy (and hence not on the intrinsic and
constructive value), and investigated the value of democracy for peace
(Chapters 3 and 4), control of corruption (Chapter 5) and economic
development (Chapter 6). [[This study]{.mark} was [based on]{.mark} a
search of an **[enormous academic database]{.mark}**]{.underline}5 for
certain keywords,6 [then pruned the thousands of articles down to a few
hundred articles]{.underline} (see Appendix) [which statistically
analysed the connection between the democracy and the four expected
outcomes.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} first [[find]{.mark}ing is that [a]{.mark} **reverse
[wave]{.mark}** [away from democracy **has not
happened**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Chapter 2). Not yet, at least.
[[Democracy is not doing worse]{.underline}]{.mark} than before, at
least not in comparative perspective. While it is true that there is a
dramatic decline in democracy in some countries,7 [a general trend
downwards cannot]{.underline} yet [be detected.]{.underline} It would be
better to talk about 'stagnation', as not [many [dictatorships have
democratized]{.mark} recently]{.underline}, [while democracies have
not]{.underline} yet [collapsed.]{.underline}

[[Another finding is]{.mark} that the]{.underline} instrumental [[value
of democracy is **very questionable**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The field
has been deeply polarized between researchers who endorse a link between
democracy and positive outcomes, and those who reject this optimistic
idea and instead emphasize the negative effects of democracy. [There has
been '**no consensus'**]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} quantitative
[literature on whether democracy has instrumental value which leads some
beneficial general outcomes.]{.underline} Some [scholars
claim]{.underline} there is a [consensus]{.underline}, but they [only do
so by ignoring a]{.underline} **[huge amount]{.underline}** [of
literature which rejects their own point of view.]{.underline} [After
undertaking a **large-scale analysis**]{.underline} of carefully
selected articles published on the topic (see Appendix), [this book can
conclude that [the connections between democracy
and]{.mark}]{.underline} expected [[benefits]{.underline} **[are
not]{.underline}**]{.mark} as **[[strong]{.underline}]{.mark}** as they
seem. Hence, we should not overstate the links between the phenomena.

[The overall evidence is **weak**]{.underline}. [Take]{.underline} the
expected [[impact]{.underline} [of democracy on
peace]{.underline}]{.mark} [for example]{.underline}. As Chapter 3
showed, the study of democracy and interstate war has been a flourishing
theme in political science, particularly since the 1970s. However,
[there are four reasons why democracy does not cause peace]{.underline}
between countries, [and why the empirical support for the popular idea
of democratic peace [is **quite weak**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most
[statistical studies have not found a strong correlation]{.underline}
between democracy and interstate war [at the dyadic level. They show
that [there are]{.mark} other---[more
powerful---explanations]{.mark}]{.underline} for war and peace, and
[even that the impact of democracy is a **spurious one**]{.underline}
(caveat 1). Moreover, [the theoretical foundation of the democratic
peace hypothesis is **weak**]{.underline}, [and the causal mechanisms
are unclear]{.underline} (caveat 2). In addition, [[democracies are
not]{.mark} necessarily [more peaceful]{.mark} in general,]{.underline}
and the evidence for the democratic peace hypothesis at the monadic
level is inconclusive (caveat 3). Finally, the process of
democratization is dangerous. Living in a democratizing country means
living in a less peaceful country (caveat 4). [With regard to peace
between countries]{.underline}, **[[we cannot defend]{.mark} the idea
[that democracy has instrumental value]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[Can]{.underline} the (instrumental) [value of democracy be found in the
prevention of civil war?]{.underline} Or is the evidence for the
opposite idea more convincing, and does democracy have a 'dark side'
which makes civil war more likely? [The findings are
**confusing**]{.underline}, which is exacerbated by the fact that
different aspects of civil war (prevalence, onset, duration and
severity) are mixed up in some civil war studies. Moreover, defining
civil war is a delicate, politically sensitive issue. Determining
whether there is a civil war in a particular country is incredibly
difficult, while measurements suffer from many weaknesses (caveat 1).
Moreover, [there is no linear link: [civil wars are just as unlikely in
democracies as]{.mark} in [dictatorships]{.mark}]{.underline} (caveat
2). Civil war is most likely in times of political change.
Democratization is a very unpredictable, dangerous process, increasing
the chance of civil war significantly. Hybrid systems are at risk as
well: the chance of civil war is much higher compared to other political
systems (caveat 3). More specifically, both the strength and type of
political institutions matter when explaining civil war. However, the
type of political system (e.g. democracy or dictatorship) is not the
decisive factor at all (caveat 4). Finally, democracy has only limited
explanatory power (caveat 5). Economic factors are far more significant
than political factors (such as having a democratic system) when
explaining the onset, duration and severity of civil war. To prevent
civil war, it would make more sense to make poorer countries richer,
instead of promoting democracy. Helping countries to democratize would
even be a very dangerous idea, as countries with changing levels of
democracy are most vulnerable, making civil wars most likely. It is true
that there is evidence that the chance of civil war decreases when the
extent of democracy increases considerably. The problem however is that
most countries do not go through big political changes but through small
changes instead; those small steps---away or towards more
democracy---are dangerous. Not only is the onset of civil war likely
under such circumstances, but civil wars also tend to be longer, and the
conflict is more cruel leading to more victims, destruction and killings
(see Chapter 4).

A more encouraging story can be told around the value for democracy to
control corruption in a country (see Chapter 5). Fighting corruption has
been high on the agenda of international organizations such as the World
Bank and the IMF. Moreover, the theme of corruption has been studied
thoroughly in many different academic disciplines---mainly in economics,
but also in sociology, political science and law. Democracy has often
been suggested as one of the remedies when fighting against high levels
of continuous corruption. So far, the statistical evidence has strongly
supported this idea. As Chapter 5 showed, dozens of studies with broad
quantitative, cross-national and comparative research have found
statistically significant associations between (less) democracy and
(more) corruption. However, there are vast problems around
conceptualization (caveat 1) and measurement (caveat 2) of 'corruption'.
Another caveat is that democratizing countries are the poorest
performers with regard to controlling corruption (caveat 3). Moreover,
it is not democracy in general, but particular political institutions
which have an impact on the control of corruption; and a free press also
helps a lot in order to limit corruptive practices in a country (caveat
4). In addition, democracies seem to be less affected by corruption than
dictatorships, but at the same time, there is clear evidence that
economic factors have more explanatory power (caveat 5). In conclusion,
more democracy means less corruption, but we need to be modest (as other
factors matter more) and cautious (as there are many caveats).

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} perceived [[impact of democracy on
development has been **highly contested**]{.underline}]{.mark} as well
(see Chapter 6). Some scholars argue that democratic systems have a
positive impact, while others argue that high levels of democracy
actually reduce the levels of economic growth and development.
Particularly since the 1990s, statistical studies have focused on this
debate, and the empirical evidence is clear: there is no direct impact
of democracy on development. Hence, both approaches cannot be supported
(see caveat 1). The indirect impact via other factors is also
questionable (caveat 2). Moreover, [there is too much variation in
levels of economic growth and development among the dictatorial systems,
and there are huge regional differences]{.underline} (caveat 3).
Adopting a one-size-fits all approach would not be wise at all. In
addition, in order to increase development, it would be better to focus
on alternative factors such as improving institutional quality and good
governance (caveat 4). [There is not sufficient evidence to state that
democracy has instrumental value]{.underline}, at least not [with regard
to economic growth.]{.underline} However, future research needs to
include broader concepts and measurements of development in their
models, as so far studies have mainly focused on explaining
cross-national differences in growth of GDP (caveat 5).

[Overall, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} instrumental [[value of democracy
is]{.underline}]{.mark}---at best---**[tentative]{.underline}**,
[or]{.underline}---if being less mild---**[simply
[non-existent]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Democracy is not necessarily
better]{.underline} than any alternative form of government. [With
regard to many of the expected benefits---such as less war, less
corruption and more economic development---democracy]{.underline} does
deliver, but so do nondemocratic systems. High or low levels of
democracy **[do not make a distinctive difference.]{.underline}**
Mid-range democracy levels do matter though. Hybrid systems can be
associated with many negative outcomes, while this is also the case for
democratizing countries. Moreover, other explanations---typically
[certain favorable [economic factors]{.mark} in a
country]{.underline}---**[[are much more powerful]{.mark} to explain the
expected benefits]{.underline}**, at least [compared to the single fact
that a country is a democracy or not. The impact of democracy **fades
away**]{.underline} [in the powerful shadows of the economic
factors.]{.underline}8

### Ext \-\-- Democracy D

#### Alt causes

**[Klaas '21]{.underline}** \[Brian; June 11; associate professor of
global politics at University College London; the Washington Post,
"Opinion: The world is horrified by the dysfunction of American
democracy,"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/06/11/pew-research-global-opinion-us-democracy/\]

It's official: [[America is **no longer** a "**shining city**]{.mark}
**up[on a hill]{.mark}**[."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Data released]{.underline} Thursday [from Pew]{.underline} Research
[shows]{.underline} that our allies are beyond delighted that the Trump
presidency has ended. Confidence in U.S. leadership has soared. Our
friends are breathing a sigh of relief.

But buried in that story about the United States' post-Trump redemption
is some seriously bad news: U.S. [[allies see]{.mark} our [democracy
as]{.mark} a **[shattered, washed-up]{.mark} has-been**. We **used** to
provide a **democratic model** for the world, but no longer. The
**chaos**, **dysfunction** and **insanity** of the past several years
have taken a **predictable toll**]{.underline}.

The numbers are depressing. [Just [14 percent]{.mark}]{.underline} of
Germans [[see America]{.mark}n democracy [as a **desirable
model**]{.mark} for other countries, while **54 percent** say that it
"**used** to be a **good example**, but has not been in recent
years."]{.underline} Public opinion in France, Britain, South Korea,
Japan and Australia is similarly bleak. In New Zealand, fewer than 1 in
10 citizens sees American democracy as a desirable model.

[It turns out]{.underline} the rest of [the]{.underline} democratic
[[world wasn't]{.mark} **particularly [impressed]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [**former authoritarian
president**, who spread **[conspiracy theories]{.mark}**, tweeted
**narcissistic absurdities** while 400,000 people died of
[covid]{.mark}-19, [and]{.mark} incited a **deadly
[insurrection]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Go figure.

But these numbers coming out of our allies aren't just depressing bits
of polling trivia. They have real-world consequences. And they highlight
a disturbing, inescapable dilemma that the Biden administration must
confront: Until [the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates fixes its broken democracy at home, it
[will be [**unable** to]{.mark} **effectively [fight]{.mark}**
[authoritarianism]{.mark} abroad]{.underline}.

Put bluntly: The United States' authoritarian slide isn't just a
domestic policy issue. It's a foreign policy disaster, too.

Ever since Donald Trump emerged as the Republican front-runner in 2016,
China has been exploiting the unhinged turmoil he ushered in as evidence
that democracy is a bad joke rather than a serious way of governing a
society. As the Trump years descended into mayhem, China ramped up its
rhetoric. And when Trump's failures to contain the covid-19 pandemic
became plain for the world to see, Beijing cited it as further evidence
that democracy was a failed experiment.

Needless to say, China is no model for the rest of the world; it's a
brutal authoritarian regime that stays in power by committing genocide
against ethnic and religious minorities while silencing its critics. But
the Trump years were a gift-wrapped propaganda coup for the Chinese in
their ongoing battle to challenge the West's ideological primacy on the
global stage.

This matters because emerging economies are slowly getting pulled into
China's orbit as they seek a viable blueprint for their own development.
In Afrobarometer surveys of public opinion across Africa, China has
pulled even with the United States. Six in 10 Africans have a favorable
view of China's role in their country. And while the United States is
still seen as offering the best development model, China isn't far
behind. This is a drastic shift in just a few decades --- and it will
play an increasingly important role in U.S. foreign policy as some of
these developing countries decide whether to follow Washington or
Beijing.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [[**lost** the]{.mark}
**moral [high ground]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The world might have always
been wary of lectures from the United States about the virtues of
democracy and freedom, but at least those on the receiving end of those
lectures often believed that the country giving the lecture knew how to
build a successful democracy. That's no longer true.

At a time of authoritarian resurgence, we need the words of the U.S.
president to pack a democratic punch. Instead, they ring hollow. After
all, due to ongoing Republican machinations, American voters can't even
be sure that their right to vote will be protected in the years to come.
What can the United States teach the world about democracy when the
country is continuing its steady slide toward authoritarian politics?

This won't just hamper President Biden's foreign policy; it will also
make the world safer for authoritarianism. Although there are still
plenty of desirable democratic models around the world (I'm looking at
you, Norway), none of them has the power to take meaningful action when
a dictator rigs an election or imprisons an opposition leader. Worse,
now that the world doesn't respect or admire U.S. democracy,
[[dictators]{.mark} have a **rhetorical trump card**. They can [point
to]{.mark} the fact]{.underline} that [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}
(falsely) [[claim]{.mark}ed [the]{.mark} U.S. [election was
**rigged**]{.mark}; that [Republicans]{.mark} are **actually trying** to
[**rig** elections]{.mark} with **voter suppression** and **worsened
partisan gerrymandering**; and]{.underline} that [the]{.underline}
former [[president]{.mark} **repeatedly called** to **[jail]{.mark}**
his political [opponents]{.mark}. Our [hypocrisy will enhance
**dictators'**]{.mark} **[impunity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Comparisons between the United States' malfunctioning politics and
genuine dictatorships are, of course, hyperbolic. But [dictators
will]{.underline} nonetheless [get plenty of]{.underline} rhetorical
[mileage]{.underline} out of making them, [pointing to Washington's
failures to]{.underline} justify or [excuse]{.underline} their own
**[authoritarian plots]{.underline}**.

#### Democratic peace theory is [cherry-picked]{.underline}, and dyadic [between two democracies]{.underline} at best.

International Studies Professor at Warwick University; Rethinking the
Value of Democracy: A Comparative Perspective, "Democracy and Interstate
War," Ch. 3\]

This finding or 'law' has not only been recognized by scholars of
international relations, but also found its way outside academia and has
influenced foreign policies to promote peace and democracy, most
prominently since the 1990s. However, [my book will not]{.underline}
draw conclusions based on '**[cherry-pick]{.underline}**ing' of specific
studies showing how peaceful democracies are, but on a systematic
overview of studies in this field. Therefore, [this [book relies
on]{.mark} **my own database** with **[hundreds of]{.mark} different
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are relevant for each chapter;
the articles had to engage directly with the chapter's main research
question. The next section will provide more detailed information around
the selection criteria. This overview includes both highly cited and
recent articles which were selected in a systematic way.

Based on analyses of statistical studies around this topic of democracy
and war, it will become clear that the overall statistical support for
the democratic peace hypothesis is not strong at all. In the rest of the
chapter, I will spell out four reasons why [democracy does **not cause
peace**]{.underline}, and why [the **empirical [support]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} the popular idea of [democratic [peace]{.mark} is
**quite [weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}: (1) most [studies do [no]{.mark}t
find a **strong [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between democracy
and interstate war [[at]{.mark} the **[dyadic
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [they show that there are
**other---more powerful---explanations** for war and peace, or even that
the impact of democracy is a **spurious one**]{.underline}, (2) [the
**theoretical foundation** of the democratic peace hypothesis is
**weak**, and the causal mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}, (3)
[democracies are **not necessarily more peaceful**]{.underline} in
general, [and the [evidence]{.mark} for the democratic peace hypothesis
[at the **monadic level** is inconclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}, and (4)
the process of democratization is dangerous and living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country.

In my view, [it is]{.underline} difficult---if not
**[impossible]{.underline}**---[to support the democratic peace
hypothesis]{.underline} without any reservations. The key caveats should
not be ignored and certainly deserve more attention before we can
confidently argue that democracies are more peaceful than other types of
political systems. Please notice that I can already reveal that the
assumed link between democracy and intrastate war is problematic as
well, but this topic will be at the core of the next chapter (Chapter
4).

Selection of Articles: Democracy and War

The instrumental value of democracy cannot convincingly be found in
democracy's expected bond with peace. I have come to this conclusion on
the basis of an analysis of statistical studies, which will be discussed
in the rest of this chapter. So how did I select the articles for my
database?4

For this chapter and Chapter 4, I selected the articles that focused on
war and democracy. Using the online database Web of Science (formerly
known as Web of Knowledge), [I identified]{.underline} a total of almost
**[[8000 articles]{.underline}]{.mark}** published in the sampled
journals until the end of 2015. I identifed them by entering 'democr\*'
in the basic search field; this asterisk (\*)-based 'wildcard' allows
searching for terms including 'democratic', 'democracy', and
'democratization' (in both British and American spellings)
simultaneously, in the title, abstract and/or the keywords. As a next
step, I excluded articles in which 'democracy' is used as synonym for
state (e.g. analysis of the relationship between immigration policies
and unemployment in European democracies) or a specific political party
or movement (e.g. the 'Democrats' in the USA, or Uganda's People's
Democratic Army) or a specifc country (e.g. the Democratic Republic of
Congo). In addition, I identified them by entering 'war\*' in the basic
search feld. The words democracy (democr\*) and war (war\*) need to be
mentioned in title and/or abstract---and I also checked for equivalents
of 'war' like 'conflict' and 'dispute' and 'no peace'.5

As it is not feasible to analyse thousands of articles, it is necessary
to take a next step in the selection process. I decided to select these
articles, which will be part of the database for the third and fourth
chapter, in three different ways. The first method is to choose the
articles with the most citations. So, for example, in Chapter 3, the
articles which are cited more than a hundred times are included in this
first list. The article by Beck et al. (1998) has been cited more than
951 times, and as a consequence, this article is part of the database.
But also articles with a much lower number of citations (such as
Barbieri 1996, with 179 citations) are included in my analyses.

The second method is simply to include the most recent articles
published in the past five years, so since beginning 2011 until end
2015. The most recent articles can easily be overlooked by applying the
first method of most quoted articles. In my view, however, they still
need to be included as they present the most recent findings and engage
with the recent and innovative debates, which cannot be ignored in this
book. For example, recent studies on democracy and interstate war
(Chapter 3) have paid more attention to the mechanisms (see, e.g.,
Zeigler et al. 2014), and there is a growing attention for the impact of
political institutions in recent studies on democracy and intrastate war
(Chapter 4; see, e.g., Walter 2015). Those recent findings cannot be
ignored in any systematic analysis of statistical studies on this theme.

The third method is the most subjective approach of selecting articles,
as it is based on the 'snowballing method'. So it includes articles
which have not been selected by the first and second methods, but which
have been quoted extensively and regularly by the previously selected
articles. For example, the article by Bethany Lacina (2006) cannot be
selected based on having high citations (the first method) and it cannot
be included based on being a recent publication (the second method), but
it has been mentioned by key studies and hence surfaces via the
snowballing method (a third method). This article is important as it
**[clearly [distinguish]{.mark}]{.underline}**es [the]{.underline}
determinants of [**[conflict severity]{.mark}** from]{.underline} those
for **[conflict onset]{.underline}**, and [those [determinants
seem]{.mark} to be **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is
crucial information for Chapter 4.

In this way, my study presents and assesses the findings based on a big
pool of statistical studies in the published literature. Based on this
assessment, I will be able to draw clearer conclusions concerning the
significance of the effects of democracy on interstate war (this
chapter) and intrastate war (the next chapter). The Appendix shows more
detailed information of the selected articles.

The Democratic Peace Hypothesis, Its Roots and Supporters

The democratic peace hypothesis6 states that democracies never or seldom
go to war with one another. Where is this powerful idea of 'democratic
peace' coming from? Before discussing the main findings of the
statistical articles and before describing the four caveats of the
'democratic peace paradigm', we need to know a bit more around the
background and the roots of this idea.

Immanuel Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace has often been mentioned as
the foundation for this hypothesis. Kant believed peace was difficult to
achieve, since 'the natural state is one of war' (Kant 1795: 10). A
state of peace must therefore be established for---in his view---it is
certain that hostilities will be committed and people need to be
protected from each other. In such a world, each may treat his
neighbour, from whom he demands security, as an enemy. In a dictatorship
where 'the subjects are not citizens, a declaration of war is the
easiest thing in the world to decide upon, because war does not require
of the ruler, who is the proprietor and not a member of the state, the
least sacrifice of the pleasures of his table, the chase, his country
houses, his court functions, and the like. He may, therefore, resolve on
war as on a pleasure party for the most trivial reasons, and with
perfect indifference leave the justification which decency requires to
the diplomatic corps who are ever ready to provide it' (Kant 1795: 13).

In contrast, the situation is different in constitutional republics,
according to Kant. He argued that the majority of the people in
republics would never vote to go to war, except for pure self-defence.
Therefore, a world with only republics would be peaceful, since there
would be no aggressors. The republican constitution, which requires the
consent of the citizens to start a war, gives the positive prospect of
perpetual peace.

It is important to note that the ideas of Kant on the one hand and the
modern democratic peace scholars on the other hand are not completely
similar. For example, Kant talked about republics instead of democratic
states as the ideal states to achieve peace. He defined republican
states as states with representative governments, in which the
legislature is separated from the executive. Not
surprisingly---considering the epoch in which he lived---Kant did not
include universal suffrage in his definition, which is now seen as an
essential dimension of democracy, even of the most minimalist types of
democracy (Dahl 1971; see also Chapter 2). Moreover, Kant argued that
republics will be at peace in general, which means that such political
systems are expected to be not only in peace with each other, but also
with other non-republican systems. Nowadays, [**only few scholars**
would support]{.underline} this approach of [a '**monadic democratic
peace**']{.underline}. As will become clear at the end of this chapter,
[there is **[no]{.mark}t much [evidence]{.mark}** for the idea that
[democracies are **more peaceful in general**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the 1960s, most statistical studies have not focused on the
'monadic democratic peace hypothesis' but on testing the 'dyadic
democratic peace hypothesis'. This dyadic hypothesis states that it is
less likely that democracies fight with each other, compared to other
'dyads' or other pairs of different types of political systems. The
sociologist Dean Babst was the first scholar who started to build on
Kant's old idea in the 'dyadic' way, and decided to test it in
statistical studies (Babst 1964, 1972). He concluded that 'no wars have
been fought between independent nations with elective governments
between 1789 and 1941' (Babst 1972: 55). His study was not published in
one of the journals in the field of international relations, but in a
sociological journal and later in Industrial Research. Therefore, it was
not read by international relations scholars, and initially, it did not
get the attention it deserved in the field of international politics.

Babst's work was, for example, not cited by Melvin Small and J. David
Singer (1976), and their fndings seemed to contradict Babst's study.
However, Small and Singer did not compare the rates of war proneness for
democracies and dictatorships, but instead they focused on the question
whether wars involving democratic states have historically been
significantly different in length or in degree of violence compared to
wars involving only dictatorships. For length and degree of violence
during the wars, they did not find a difference between democracies and
dictatorships, so they concluded that types of political systems did not
matter.7 A few years later, Rudolph J. Rummel did cite Babst's work and
replicated Babst's idea in statistical tests, which were described in
the fourth book of his five-volume Understanding Confict and War (1975--
1981). He found clear support for his eleventh (of the 33) propositions
about causes and conditions of conflict, which stated that 'Libertarian
systems mutually preclude violence' (Rummel 1979: 279).

Eventually, those innovative studies from the 1970s helped to evoke the
interest in the democratic peace proposition, and in the expected
peaceful nature of relationships among democratic states. Since the
1980s, the number of quantitative studies has increased considerably,
accumulating into an impressive field of research in international
relations with its own 'empirical law' of democratic peace (Levy 1989:
270; see also Ray 1998).

This democratic peace hypothesis has not only received support from
political scientists, but also from politicians and policy makers.
Particularly since 1993, the idea of a democratic peace has inspired
American foreign policies aimed at the promotion of peace and democracy.
As the 42nd president of the USA (1993--2001), Bill Clinton was the
first politician who explicitly bridged the gap between these findings
in international relations on the one hand, and his foreign policy
strategy on the other hand, at least rhetorically. Anthony Lake, who was
Clinton's National Security Adviser, stated in 1993 that in order to
cope with America's foreign policy challenges, the expansion of
democratic states around the world would be essential because 'it
protects our \[U.S.\] interests and security' (see Henderson 2002: 20).
In his 1994 State of the Union, Clinton declared that 'Ultimately, the
best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack
each other'.8 Findings from research in the field of international
relations seemed to have a direct impact on policy making, and this move
of the Clinton administration can be seen as 'a textbook case of
arbitrage between the ivory tower and the real world' (Gowa 1999: 109).

Clinton's successor, George W. Bush, went one big step further in his
faith that democratic peace holds. He argued that efforts to turn Iraq
into a democratic country would have positive effects on Iraqi's
neighbours. The authoritarian regimes in the region would fall as domino
stones and follow the Iraqi example. They would start democratizing as
soon as they could, which would then result in achieving a peaceful and
stable the Middle East. The real motives for attacking Iraq may have
been different, but 'regime change' was at the heart of Washington's
rhetoric when the USA started to bomb Baghdad in March 2003. The
rhetoric of the Bush administration focused on toppling Saddam Hussein's
regime, and replacing the entire underlying dictatorial system with a
democracy.

Moreover, George W. Bush used the democratic peace idea to justify the
war in Iraq, declaring, 'The reason why I'm so strong on democracy is
democracies don't go to war with each other...I've got great faith in
democracies to promote peace. And that's why I'm such a strong believer
that the way forward in the Middle East, the broader Middle East, is to
promote democracy'.9 In 2004, the 43rd President of the USA said: 'If
you think you can have peace without democracy -- again - I think you'll
find that - I can only speak for myself, that I will be extremely
doubtful that it will ever happen'.10 In his second inaugural address,
he stated that 'the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends
on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world'.

Again, these are just words from speeches and can hence be seen as
rhetoric to defend military intervention (cf. Jervis 2003; Kaufmann
2004; Daalder and Lindsay 2005; Owen 2005; Lieberfeld 2005; Schmidt and
Williams 2008). Still, in the end, politicians have rationalized their
political decisions based on one of the most powerful ideas taken from
studies in the field of international relations, clearly showing the
influence of this academic idea in political practice.

Hence, the field of international relations seems to have its own law:
democracies rarely fight with each other. It cannot be denied that the
evidence supporting the democratic peace proposition is quite diverse in
character (see Ray 1998): the evidence has been epistemological (Rummel
1975), philosophical (Doyle 1986), formal (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
1992), historical (Weart 1994; Ray 1995; Owen 1994), experimental (Mintz
and Geva 1993), anthropological (Ember et al. 1992; Crawford 1994),
psychological (Kegley and Hermann 1995), economic (Brawley 1993; Weede
1996) and political (Gaubatz 1991). Still, there have been numerous
critical studies (see, i.e., Hayes 2011), and the general picture is
unclear. We do not yet know much about the overall findings from
statistical studies.

So far, it seems as if some quantitative studies---mainly within the
field of international relations---have found strong and robust evidence
which supports the 'democratic peace hypothesis'. Those studies show
that democracy has had a positive influence on international peace (see,
i.e., Rummel 1979; Ray and Russett 1996). In this sense, the idea of a
democratic peace seems to be confirmed. Political scientists such as
James Lee Ray are passionate supporters: 'No scientific evidence is
entirely definitive' but 'based on all the empirical evidence so far'
the more defensible of the two possible definitive answers to the
question "Does democracy cause peace?" is "Yes" (Ray 1998: 43). However,
based on my own analyses of the empirical studies with statistical
evidence, I cannot be as enthusiastic as those scholars; to the
contrary, I whole-heartily disagree with them, as a more systematic
analysis of the articles shows that there are four important weaknesses,
which seriously undermines the idea that peace is one of democracy's
instrumental values.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

While analysing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms (see next section, caveat 2), and hence seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this way, the
majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the idea
that democratic peace actually exists without testing this proposition.
However, **[no]{.underline}**ne of the [**studies** that **directly
test** the democratic peace]{.underline} hypothesis [found **strong
evidence** that democracy is the **most important factor** when
explaining interstate war]{.underline}. All democratic peace studies
have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace, such
as [economic development and growth, geographic distance and contiguity,
power status, alliance ties, militarization and political
stability]{.underline}. The findings show that it is not just democracy
which explains war, not at all. Within this group of studies, which
explicitly test the democratic peace hypothesis, four different types of
findings can be detected. I will discuss those results more in-depth in
the rest of this section.

First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Significant Too

The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically significant as well (Maoz and Russett
1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck et al. 1998;
Ray 2013). For example, some studies (e.g. Rousseau et al. 1996)
included alternative independent variables in order to test realist
arguments. They tested whether the distribution of power determines
decisions to use force, and measures each state's military capabilities
relative to its opponent. A state's military capability is the average
of three elements: number of troops, military expenditures and military
expenditures per soldier. They found that this realist variable was
strong, positive and statistically significant at the 0.001 level in
their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However,
not only a state's military capabilities appeared to be an important
explanation for peace. In addition, wealth, growth, alliances and
contiguity played a crucial role when explaining interstate war (see,
e.g., Maoz and Russett 1993: 632, Table 1).11 Moreover, [[when]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** are [included]{.mark}, the **impact of
[democracy]{.mark}** on the likelihood of international crises
[is]{.mark} **even [spurious]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett
1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141, see also p. 3).12 Still, scholars in
this group keep defending the democratic peace idea, despite the fact
that their own analyses showed the significance of alternative
explanations.

Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models

The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau 2013; Gartzke
and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate the spuriousness
of the statistical democratic peace pointed to [other
factors]{.underline} that, [when accounted for '**properly'**,
**eliminated**]{.underline} or dramatically reduced [the statistical
significance of shared democracy]{.underline}. Hence, the studies in
this second group did not find strong evidence for the democratic peace
hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were included in the
models.14

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that [there is **no democratic peace**, but a **capitalist
peace instead**]{.underline}. The settlement in Germany and Japan
succeeded because of the establishment of capitalist peace. Because of
economic support by the Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered
trade opportunities in practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe
and Japan would gain economically, resulting in 'economic growth,
prosperity, and, ultimately, free trade among most of the more
technologically advanced economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By
establishing and expanding free trade, the incentives for war would
quickly decrease among trading states, according to this approach. To
prevent new interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was
a far more important factor than the American promotion of democracy and
its political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014).
[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [peace]{.mark} **only [exists]{.mark}** [when
both]{.mark} democracies [have **high**]{.mark} **levels of economic
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when economic development is well
above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and **[the
[poorest]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4--5% of current [[**democracies**,
are]{.mark} **significantly [more likely]{.mark}** than other kinds of
political systems [to **fight each other**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Mousseau 2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies
involved has a very low level of economic development, then democracy
cannot prevent war.16 Still, there is a pacifying effect of [free trade
and economic interdependence]{.underline}, which [is **more important**
than the effect of democracy]{.underline}, because the former affects
peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development
and ultimately, democracy (see Weede 2004).17

Capitalist peace is not the only alternative explanation. Shared
interests in general, and political similarities in specific, can also
be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and peace
between countries (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997; Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999;
Henderson 2002). [Democracies are **not peaceful** to each other because
they are **democratic**, but rather because they are
**similar**]{.underline}. So the difference of the scores of both
countries also contributes to the conflict proneness of the dyad. If the
difference in levels of democracy is big, then the chance of conflict is
higher (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it difficult to distinguish
between the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the first scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefits of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger

This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for peace
(and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies in
the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically significant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war (Bremer 1992; Gelpi
1997; Oneal and Russett 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002; Peterson 2013;
Caselli et al. 2015).

Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that [democracy is
**not the most important factor**]{.underline}, while war is more likely
to occur between states that are geographically proximate, approximately
equal in power, major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly
militarized than between those that are not. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, [multivariate analyses revealed some
differences]{.underline}. Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that
some factors are far more important than others. [The existence of a
**dangerous, [war]{.mark}-prone dyad** can be **[best explained
by]{.mark}** the **presence of [contiguity]{.mark}**, the **absence of
an [alliance]{.mark}** and the **absence of more advanced
[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The absence of democratic polity and
other factors (absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of
major power) are less powerful. Overall, these findings suggest that our
research priorities may be seriously distorted and that we should not
focus too much on the perceived positive impact of democracy, but on
other factors (such as alliances and economic factors) instead.

Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions

The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors. The chance of
democratic peace depends not just on the specific historical period
(Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons 1991;
Weede 1984), but also the stage of the conflict (beginning, duration or
severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed 2000), and on the
neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the region; see Gibler
and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013). Despite the differences
between the studies, there is one common finding in all studies: when
explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on the impact of
democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some specific historical periods. Based on
this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War. For example, Henry Farber and
Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea that peace
between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the threat from
the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another (see
also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued that most of
the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after
World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which
can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and
maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
conflict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the
benefits of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). Moreover, jointly democratic
dyads are likely to be allied only after 1945 (see Gibler and Sarkees
2004); during the 1816--1944 time period, there is even a negative
relationship between democratic dyads and alliance formation.20 These
findings cast serious doubts on the idea of a general existence of
democratic peace.

Not only the historical period, but also [the ***stage*** of the
conflict is crucial]{.underline}. Some scholars in this group provided
evidence that [democratic peace is **not universal**]{.underline}, but
that it depends on the stage and whether we focus on the beginning,
duration or severity of the conflict. Although joint democracy has some
pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results suggest that
they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to war (see Reed 2000).
Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the neighbourhood
instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues over which to
contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region. Democracies only
seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours, and therefore
they can more easily choose favourable conflicts to escalate. The type
of political system does not predict conflict selection or victory once
controls are added for issue salience (Gibler and Miller 2013; see also
Park and James 2015). There is an interaction between joint democracy
and regional instability, which confirms the idea that the effects of
type of political system on continued conflict apply mostly to dyads in
peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see also Park and James
2015). [**Very democratic countries** might]{.underline} even [become
**more aggressive** and **faster** than other political systems, once
the **region** becomes more hostile]{.underline} (see, e.g., Baliga et
al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries (Table 3.1).

Caveat 2: What Are the Causal Mechanisms?

Most of the statistical studies on democratic peace seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war; based on this
assumption, they then decide to focus on the mechanisms. This is
problematic as none of the democratic peace studies found strong
evidence that democracy is the most important factor when explaining
interstate war (see the previous section). As a consequence, the next
step of looking for mechanisms is quite irrelevant and not necessary in
my view, but most studies nevertheless argue that the field lacks strong
theoretical foundations and robust empirical evidence that can reveal
convincing causal mechanisms.22 Those studies seem to accept the
correlation between dyadic democracy and peace, and then start
questioning whether democracy really causes peace before investigating
potential mechanisms.

a degree that justifies war as the 'ultimate means" must rely on
practical judgments. and practical judgments can differ among even
reasonable people. democracies might disagree whether or not the
judgment applies in specific cases. Democracies also show variance in
that regard due (o a systematic. political-culturally rooted different
propensity to judge situations as justifing war or not, and to
participate in such wars (Gels et al, 2013). It should also be noted
that, given the continuum between autocracy, anocracy and democracy,
whether a given state is a democracy or not can be subject to
interpretation. and this interpretation may even change over time (Oren
1995, Hayes 2013). The fact is that there are a couple of fairly warlike
democracies, and that the democracies participating most frequently in
military disputes (apart from the special case of Israel) are, by and
large. major powers such as the United States, the United Kingdom.
France. or India. This pattern is important to keep in mind when the
question of the utility of democratic peace for today 's world problems
is to be answered. Transnational terrorism, failed states, civil wars
and the like dominate the international agenda on war and peace. At the
classical level of international relations, in the relationships among
major powers. developments arc undcr way which potentially pose an even
greater threat than this diverse collection of non-interstate problems
presently does. [We are living in an era of rather rapid and disturbing
power change]{.underline} (Tammcn et al. 2000). The United States are
still the leading power of the world with unprecedented militany and

position and take measures to ensure its position at the lop. These
actions may frustrate emerging powers and even lead to the perception
that their security is endangered. which would motivate counter-measures
that further propel a political escala tion spiral. An increasingly
focused competition in which a true power change appears increasingly
possible. that is. a change of position at the top of the international
hierarchy, has an even greater risk potential. If the inherent dangers
are not contained---which remains always a possibility major power war

that nuclear deterrence will prevent this calamity once and for all. Of
course, states can grow peacefully into roles of higher responsibility.
status and influence on the world stage. There arc no natural laws
saving that changes in the world's power structure must end in war,
despite all distur bances and ensuing risks (Rauch 2014). The less
conflict an emerging power experiences with established ones, and with
peer challengers that emerge simultaneously, the better the chances that
the rise will travel a peaceful trajectory. Looking through this lens.
thc relations of only one emerging power with the present hegemon appear
to be partially conflict-pronc. and seriously so: it concerns the pair
China/United States. The Iwo great powers are rivals for preponderance
in East and South East Asia and eventually for being the number one at
the global level. There is also Chinese resentment stemming from the US
role in China's past as a victim of Western imperialism. On the other
hand. China's authoritarian system of rule and ensuing violations of
human and political rights trigger the liberal resentment discussed in
the first part of this chapter. which is rooted particularly strongly in
US political culture. The Chinese---US relationship is thus thc key to a

#### 2. Median voter theory -- democracies fight capital intensive wars more frequently. 

**[Caverley 10]{.underline}** -- Jonathan, Poli Sci Prof @ NU, The Myth
of Military Myopia: Democracy, Small Wars, and Vietnam, International
Security 34.3.

This section offers a theory of how a rational actor, [[the average
voter]{.mark} in a democracy, can [favor]{.mark}]{.underline} what
appears to be a **[[nonstrategic policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To do
so, it uses the core logic of a research program claiming that this sort
of behavior should rarely happen in democracies. The theory presented
here shares three impor- tant assumptions with the cost-internalization
logic of democratic exception- alism: the distribution of costs within
the state affects its pursuit of security; a democratic government\'s
provision of security is a public good; and voters \"take a reasonably
level-headed cost-benefit approach in forming attitudes to- wards
military missions.\"28 I relax the claim that costs are always
internalized within democracies, however, arguing that the average
voter\'s share may be much lower than the state\'s per capita costs.
Even in democracies, wealth is not distributed equally within any given
state; the person with median income is less well off than someone
possessing the mean. A political-economic approach, the Meltzer-Richard
hypothesis, suggests that if the median voter can set a tax rate and
spend the revenue on a service available to all citizens, she will take
advantage of the potential for re- distribution.29 Even with a flat tax
on income, the wealthy will pay a larger portion of the costs for a
public good enjoyed by all. For example, in 2005 the fifth of the
population with the highest incomes paid 69 percent of all U.S. fed-
eral tax revenue, and the middle fifth paid only 9 percent.30 Similarly,
[the median voter will prefer [to tax capital more heavily]{.mark} than
labor, because labor income is distributed more equally than capital
income]{.underline}.31 How these taxes are spent plays a most important
role in establishing the redistributive nature of the public good of
defense. [[Military doctrine]{.mark}, the means by which military power
is developed and exercised, can be stylized as a production function
[consist]{.mark}ing [of **two factors**]{.mark} -
**[capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., **[tanks, planes, ammunition,
and even training]{.underline}**) [[and labor]{.mark}
(**soldiers**]{.underline}, sailors, etc.) - as well as the technology
that allows one factor of production to serve as a substitute for
another.32 Capital and labor are imperfect replacements and show
diminishing returns; given a hundred tanks and ten soldiers, adding
another tank will not produce as much capability as adding another
soldier. The type of conflict af- fects substitutions as well; it is
much harder to substitute capital for labor when fighting an
unconventional opponent. Tax revenue can pay for both the capital and
labor inputs. Personnel also can be supplied through conscription, a tax
on a citizen\'s labor rather than income. [[Even if]{.mark} the [odds of
being conscripted are equal]{.mark}ly distributed, [the median voter
will demand]{.mark} that a larger amount of the [military budget go
toward]{.mark} the purchase of [capital to reduce]{.mark} the
[risk]{.mark} of conscription. In cases where existing threats do not
currently justify resorting to conscription]{.underline}, [military
capitalization will still to a large degree determine a draft\'s future
likelihood]{.underline}. The median voter normally will be happy with an
expensive, all-volunteer military; but once the level of threat creates
a demand for labor that reaches into the middle class, the voter will
support a conscripted military where draftees are protected by large
amounts of capital.33 [Casualties are also a public bad: no one wants to
see their fellow citizens die]{.underline}. The less wealthy are more
likely to be drafted and to join an all-volunteer force; they may gain
jobs from domestic weapons manufacturing; and they of- ten regard
military service as a means of acquiring human capital. Conscription is
therefore an important, but not the only, reason why militaries with
large amounts of labor can be a public bad. The median voter will accept
a higher tax, what the British socialist Sidney Webb called the
\"conscription of riches,\" to build highly capitalized militaries both
in peace and in war, because such militaries redistribute money and
skills through jobs and training as well as reduce the risk of
conscription and casualties. The median voter theory outlined above does
not claim to perfectly capture how policy is made in a democracy, nor
does it argue that one\'s relative in- come determines one\'s position
on foreign policy. Rather, this simple theory suggests an equally simple
insight: a military doctrine that privileges capital over labor will
reduce the costs of conflict for an important swath of voters. A
capitalized military not only results in many voters doing less of the
fighting themselves, but also allows someone else\'s resources to fund
the costs of war. **[[Politicians]{.mark} should [respond
accordingly]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This distribution of costs explains
how a state\'s seemingly nonstrategic behavior may be in the interests
of important rational actors within a democracy. Because of its
redistributive nature, [a [capitalized military doctrine]{.mark} can
[lead to **moral hazard**]{.mark},]{.underline} [which arises when
perverse incentives encourage actors to pursue risky
behavior]{.underline}. For example, drivers with auto theft coverage are
more likely to park on the street than pay for secure parking. Many
domestic gov- ernment programs merge moral hazard with the
Meltzer-Richard effect dis- cussed above. Deposit insurance uses
government backing to insure bank deposits up to a certain limit, a
redistributive public good. Because the insur- ance applies regardless
of the bank (subject to government regulations), an individual has
little motivation to consider the bank\'s solvency. Indeed, she is
likely to choose the higher interest provided by a bank making risky
investments. [**Regarding defense provision, a [lack of cost
internalization creates]{.mark} an [incentive for the]{.mark} median
[voter to support risky behavior]{.mark}**[:]{.mark} that is,
[using]{.mark} a [capital- intensive military in conflicts where
**substitutability is low**]{.mark} because the decreased likelihood of
winning is outweighed by the lower costs of fighting in such a
manner.]{.underline} [If the median voter\'s risky behavior is in effect
being subsidized by the wealthy, [democratic leaders sensitive
to]{.mark} this [voter\'s costs]{.mark} will [pursue strategies that
make success less likely]{.mark}]{.underline}. [I]{.underline} argue
that this is what happened in Vietnam.

[The [democratic peace]{.mark}]{.underline}---the observation that
democracies are less likely to fight each other than are other pairings
of states---[[is one of the most widely acknowledged]{.mark} empirical
[regularities in i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations. Prominent
scholars have even characterized the relationship as an empirical
law]{.underline} (Levy 1988; Gleditsch 1992). The discovery of a special
peace in liberal dyads stimulated enormous scholarly debate and led to,
or reinforced, a number of policy initiatives by various governments and
international organizations. Although a broad consensus has emerged
among researchers regarding the empirical correlation between joint
democracy and peace, disagreement remains as to its logical foundations.
Numerous theories have been proposed to account for how democracy
produces peace, if only dyadically (e.g., Russett 1993; Rummel 1996;
Doyle 1997; Schultz 2001).

[[At the **same time**, peace appears likely to foster or maintain
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} (Thompson 1996; James, Solberg,
andWolfson 1999). A vast swath of research in political science and
economics proposes explanations for the origins of liberal government
involving variables such as economic development (Lipset 1959; Burkhart
and Lewis-Beck 1994; Przeworski et al. 2000; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006;
Epstein et al. 2006) and inequality (Boix 2003), political interests
(Downs 1957; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 2003), power hierarchies (Moore
1966; Lake 2009), third party inducements (Pevehouse 2005) or
impositions (Peceny 1995; Meernik 1996), geography (Gleditsch 2002b),
and natural resource endowments (Ross 2001), to list just a few
examples. [[Each]{.underline}]{.mark} of these putative
**[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark}**s [[of democracy is]{.mark} **also**
[associated with]{.mark} various [explanations for international
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, some as yet poorly defined set of
canonical factors may contribute both to democracy and to peace,
[[making it **look** as if the two variables are **directly related**,
**even if possibly they are not**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

We seek to contribute to this literature, not by proposing yet another
theory to explain how democracy vanquishes war, but by estimating the
causal effect of joint democracy on the probability of militarized
disputes using a quasi-experimental research design. We begin by noting
that [[some of the **common causes** of democracy and peace may be
**unobservable**]{.mark}, [generating an **endogenous
relations**hip]{.mark} between the two. [Theories of democracy and
explanations for peace are at a **formative state**; it is **not
possible** to utilize detailed]{.mark}, validated and widely accepted
[models of each of these processes to assess their
interaction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [to a **remarkable degree**
[democracy and peace each remain **poorly understood** and **weakly
accounted** for]{.mark} **empirically**, despite their central roles in
international politics. We address the risk of spurious correlation by
applying an **instrumental variables approach**. Having **taken into
account possible endogeneity** between democracy and peace, [we
find]{.mark} that joint [democracy does **not** have **a**n
**independent** pacifying effect on]{.mark} interstate
[conflict]{.mark}. Instead]{.underline}, our [[findings show that
democratic countries are **more likely** to attack other democracies
than are non-democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Our [results **call into
question** the]{.underline} large body of [theory that]{.underline} has
been proposed to [account for]{.underline} the [**apparent** pacifism of
democratic dyads]{.underline}.

#### It\'s an [empirical]{.underline} question, [answered]{.underline} by statistical methods\-\--failing to code based on [exogenous]{.underline} variables [corrupts]{.underline} their evidence

Before we review our approach in detail, it may be useful to explain why
[this type of analysis has **not** been pursued **successfully** in the
past]{.underline} and [what makes our effort **different** from
other]{.underline}, broadly related [projects. We are not the first to
apply an IV framework]{.underline} (more specifically) [or
multi-equation models]{.underline} (more broadly) [to the democratic
peace. However, [**previous attempts** suffer from two **major
problems**. First]{.mark}, previous [studies have]{.mark} typically
[used a **dyad**]{.mark}]{.underline} (country pair) [[as the
**unit**]{.underline}]{.mark} of observation in analyzing conflict,
[[which requires]{.underline}]{.mark} some **[[summary
measure(s)]{.underline}]{.mark}** of democracy [for a pair]{.underline}
of countries [[rather than the]{.underline}]{.mark} state-level
[[**(monadic)** democracy measure]{.underline}]{.mark}. 6 [[Use of a
dyadic aggregate]{.mark} to represent regime type [creates a
**discrepancy** between]{.mark} the **[first stage regression]{.mark}**
(predicting democracy at the country level) [and the **outcome stage
regression**]{.mark} (predicting conflict at the dyad
level).]{.underline} 7 [[We **avoid this**]{.mark} problem by using the
**directed dyad** as the **unit** of observation in predicting conflict,
**distinguishing** between the potential challenger and target in a
dispute. This allows us to connect the first stage
equations]{.underline} (predicting the challenger's and target's regime
types) [and the outcome stage equation **seamlessly**]{.underline}.
Doing so has several benefits: the outcome stage model could directly
include country-level covariates (such as challenger's and target's
democracy) without having to convert them to a dyadic summary.
[This]{.underline} also [allows us to estimate the system of equations
jointly rather than relying on the **"forbidden
regression."**]{.underline} 8

[[Second]{.mark}, a more daunting challenge]{.underline} in applying an
IV approach to democratic peace research [[is the difficulty of finding
a **plausible instrument** for **regime type**]{.underline} [--- a
variable that is **strongly correlated** with **regime type** but is
**unrelated to war**. This is the challenge that has **plagued**
empirical researchers in many fields]{.underline}]{.mark}[. For example,
a recent study]{.underline} of the effect of regime type on economic
growth [uses a **diffusion-based** measure]{.underline} of democracy
(i.e., average value of democracies in a given region) as an instrument
for democracy (Acemoglu et al. 2019). [However]{.underline},
diffusion-based [[instruments]{.underline}]{.mark} such as this [[are
unlikely to be]{.underline}]{.mark} a **[[valid]{.underline}]{.mark}**
instrument, [[due to **spatial spill-over**, **interdependence**,
and]{.underline}]{.mark}, most importantly,
**[[simultaneity]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Betz, Cook, and Hollenbach
2018). Recognizing problems with spatial instruments, McDonald (2015)
seeks to exploit the very discrepancy between country-level and
dyad-level designs as the source of identification. His discussion,
however, lacks a clear explanation as to why some determinants of regime
type do not influence conflict. 9

[[We turn to a **demographic** variable]{.underline}]{.mark} --- average
female **[fertility rate]{.underline}** in a given country --- [[as a
source of **variation in regime type** that is **exogenous** to
international conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. As we will argue below, [[a
lower fertility rate is a **strong driver** of
democratization]{.underline}]{.mark}. We will [also]{.underline} present
theoretical arguments and a series of falsification tests that support
the claim that average national **[[fertility]{.underline}]{.mark}**
rate [[does **not**]{.underline}]{.mark} directly [[influence]{.mark}
international **[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

#### US and Israel prove -- citizen preferences for a capital-intensive military doctrine lock in aggressive foreign policy and protracted warfare -- legal reforms fail. 

**[Caverley 10]{.underline}** -- Jonathan, Poli Sci Prof @ NU, The Myth
of Military Myopia: Democracy, Small Wars, and Vietnam, International
Security 34.3.

This article shows that, contrary to the consensus regarding U.S.
military intransigence in the face of unconventional warfare, [civilian
officials in Lyndon Johnson\'s administration - and ultimately the
American public - played an essential role in the selection of a
capital-intensive strategy to fight insurgents in the Vietnam
War]{.underline}. President Johnson was convinced that the American
public would punish any administration that \"lost\" South Vietnam to
communism, but he was equally certain that public preferences
constrained the number of U.S. forces to be deployed and lives to be
lost far more than the amount of money to be spent and ordnance to be
consumed. In response, he and his sub- ordinates instructed the military
to fight what they themselves acknowledged to be an ineffective,
capital- and firepower-intensive strategy. The article ex- plains this
seemingly nonstrategic behavior using a theory, generalizable be- yond
this specific case, of the distribution of the costs of war within the
electorate.138 [[Israel\'s experience]{.mark} in its 2006 war against
Hezbollah [suggests]{.mark} that [this]{.mark} phenomenon [is not

strategic culture.139 Israel expended 170,000 artillery shells, twice
the number fired in the conve tional 1973 Arab-Israeli War, in a

rapid air and small-unit ground assault that relied on firepower to
control territory - was designed to minimize the number of ground forces
and casualties. The Israeli cabinet rejected it; the transportation
minister objected to \"exposing 40,000 troops to the Lebanese
reality.\"141 Four days into the conflict, the IDF deputy chief of staff
recommended stopping the campaign: \"We have exhausted the \[aerial\]
effort; we have reached the peak; from now on we can only descend.\"142
Nonetheless, despite its intention to avoid a ground war, the Israeli
government announced ambitious goals far beyond releasing hostages and
deterring further rocket attacks.143 A report written by a subsequent
government commission describing the strategic co- nundrum evokes the
constraints faced by Johnson in Vietnam: \"[Declared [goals were too
ambitious]{.mark}, and it was publicly stated that fighting will
continue till they are achieved. But the authorized [military operations
did not enable]{.mark} their [achievement]{.mark}.\"]{.underline} The
report acknowledges the government\'s bind: no \"other ef- fective
military response to such missile attacks than an extensive and pro-
longed ground operation\" existed, but this \"would have a high \'cost\'
and did not enjoy broad support.\"144 Cost distribution theory makes
such behavior explicable. From four ma- jor assumptions - [security is a
public good; [voters weigh security benefits against]{.mark} taxes,
conscription, and [casualties]{.mark}; median wealth is less than mean
wealth in every state; and the preferences of the median voter are
heeded [in]{.mark} a [democracy]{.mark} - **I derive [a]{.mark} voter
[preference for a capitalized military]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like the
democratic exceptionalist research program, this article finds evidence
that the American public weighs the benefits of limited war against the
costs. Although one recent study of American public opinion assigns
expectations of success as the most important factor in the public\'s
support for a conflict, it also points out that the public more
generally carries out relatively competent cost-benefit analysis.145
This article extends this logic by arguing that when the ability to
substitute matériel for personnel is low, as it is against
unconventional opponents, [[democracies]{.mark} may still [prosecute
wars using]{.mark} an [ill-suited]{.mark} military [doctrine]{.mark}
(and [thus a lower chance of success]{.mark}), because the costs remain
modest for this pivotal voter.]{.underline} [Democratic
[exceptionalism\'s]{.mark} cost-[internalization mechanism provides an
overly optimistic assessment of]{.mark} democracies\' discretion in
**[how and]{.mark} even [when]{.mark}** [they fight]{.mark} small
wars.]{.underline} Neither an apolitical public, nor a dysfunctional
military culture, nor a military doctrine divorced from grand strategy
causes a flawed warfighting strategy. Rather, [it results from political
leaders\' assessment of the average voter\'s preferences]{.underline}.
Although claiming that democracies substitute capital for labor to
reduce the costs of war for voters is not news, tying the pur- suit of
such a strategy to a rational voter has two novel and important
implications. First, many observers argue that most wars of the
twenty-first century will be hybrid conflicts involving unconventional
opponents; finding the root cause of poor counterinsurgency is an
essential task. This article argues that [fixating on reforming the
armed services]{.underline} (or even the civilian tools of foreign
policy) [in an effort to improve democratic performance in small wars
**is [its own]{.mark} form of [myopia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} My theory
gives reason to be skeptical of how much the U.S. military will be
allowed to shift by future administrations and the public to which they
are held accountable. Dysfunctional organizations can eventu- ally learn
and adapt. If the public suffers from foolish preconceptions, it may be
dissuaded through public education and the marketplace of ideas. Even
positing a powerful strategic culture underpinning U.S. doctrine
suggests that \"it is at least possible that by deconstructing the
standard American \'way\' . . . some pathways to improved performance
may be identified.\"146 **[But [if a rational]{.mark}, fully [informed
electorate views such]{.mark} a military doctrine [as its best
option]{.mark}, the [prospects for change are less
clear]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} third [[challenge to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[integration of cyber effects in NATO]{.mark} operations [relates
to]{.mark} a well-known military concept,
**[deconfliction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The coordination by
allies]{.underline} and military units [of their efforts to avoid
confliction, between for example an air operation and a special forces
operation in the same area, is a central element in every military
campaign. Deconfliction is all about openness and communication between
allied partners]{.underline}. **[[But in cyber]{.mark}space,
[deconfliction comes with]{.mark} several
[difficulties]{.mark}]{.underline}**. At the core of these difficulties
is the fact that [the [tools]{.mark} and techniques [that produce cyber

also used and [[heavily depended on]{.underline}]{.mark} for
**[[intelligence collection]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[are]{.underline}

**[not known for sufficient]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[mutual
[trust]{.mark} among members]{.underline}** to share intelligence,40
[[there is little indication that allies will become **more open
about**]{.mark} **the cyber [tools and techniques]{.mark}**]{.underline}
they currently have at their disposal. [The request-based model is the

Second, [beyond operational requirements for secrecy, [states make
political decisions to **eschew attribution**]{.mark}]{.underline} for
offensive cyber operations.64 States employ technical methods to avoid
attribution (e.g., obfuscating points of departure of attacks by using
spoofing, proxy servers, third-party infrastructure, compromised
certificates, and other anonymizing capabilities) [as well as make
deliberate efforts to **obscure command and control for
cyberattacks**]{.underline} (e.g., using cyber proxies with varying
degrees of plausible deniability).65 [[The]{.mark} time requirements for
a targeted state to achieve attribution at a reasonable confidence
threshold, as well as its [willingness to share potentially sensitive

[Although crucial to solving the challenge, [the intelligence component
has been the **most underrated aspect**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
public debate. [[The reason]{.underline}]{.mark} for that [[is the
**classification of intelligence**]{.underline}]{.mark} materials and
thus their rare exposure to public scrutiny. After the US presidential
elections in 2016, the American intelligence community issued a
declassified intelligence report18 that was supposed to convince the
public of Russia's guilt. It however achieved almost the opposite effect
because -- due to declassification -- the public report no longer
contained any hard proof of Russian intervention. When asked whether
they think Russia attempted to meddle in the 2016 presidential
elections, 45% of respondents in the US answered either that they do not
know or that it is not true.19 At the end of the day, it is the state's
strategic choice how much it discloses about what it knows and how it
obtained its intelligence. Therefore, credible attribution is indeed
within the realms of possibility. [[Whether]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[proof can be presented to]{.mark} international organisations
**(e.g.**]{.underline} UN, **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and/or the
public or not is a different story as this [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
likely [[mean exposure of the intelligence operation. Revealing such an
intelligence operation would decrease the likelihood of it still being
effective in the future]{.mark}. If attackers follow the
counter-response to their actions closely, they might be able to
identify what measures were used to track them down and circumvent/avoid
them if possible.]{.underline}

Relationships built on trust and mutual interests are also necessary to
obtain cooperation from foreign governments in the area of Intelligence
and Information. [[It is useful to separate]{.underline}]{.mark} **[the

[**[Security Cooperation]{.underline}**. [Intelligence

crime. [By its nature, however]{.underline}, **[such sharing [involves

normally in the context of a bilateral relationship. [[Its sensitivity
requires delicate handling in **highly restrictive
channels**]{.mark}**.** [Intelligence sharing]{.mark}, in
practice,]{.underline} **[[falls outside the scope of Security

Both Intelligence Sharing and Intelligence Security Cooperation are
mutually supporting. It is clear that the quality and reliability of
intelligence we get from our partners depends on the competence,
capability, professionalism, and trustworthiness of their national
intelligence services and how compatible their operations are with ours.
Intelligence Security Cooperation provides the tools to develop
long-range relationships with foreign partners to improve both the
quality of the intelligence we share and our ability to work together.

#### US Cyber capabilities are high but China is catching up

**[Marks 21]{.underline}** \-\-- Joseph Marks, Anchor of The
Cybersecurity 202 newsletter, Washington Post, "The Cybersecurity 202:
The United States is still number one in cyber capabilities", June 2021,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/28/cybersecurity-202-united-states-is-still-number-one-cyber-capabilities/

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [remains **by
far**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the world's most cyber-capable
nation]{.underline}]{.mark} with no major competitors for the title.

[[That's the conclusion from a]{.mark} mammoth 182-page
[report]{.mark}]{.underline} released today by British think tank the
International Institute for Strategic Studies [[that reviews the cyber
capabilities of]{.mark} 15 of the [world's biggest players]{.mark} in
**hacking and digital defense**]{.underline}. The report assesses both
government and private-sector capabilities.

[[The report relegates]{.mark} the most troublesome U.S. adversaries,
[Russia and China, to a second tier]{.mark} of [cyber
powers]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} That group also contains the
United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Israel and France.

[[However, China's rapid digital development]{.mark} and its growing
slate of technology firms [make it]{.mark}]{.underline} ["**[the only
state currently on a trajectory to join the U.S]{.underline}**.]{.mark}
in the first tier of cyber powers," the authors warn.

[The report]{.underline} marks a major endorsement for U.S. cyber
capabilities, which have been called into question by a string of major
cyberattacks by Kremlin-linked hackers and Russia-based cybercriminals.
It also [comes as U.S. officials are struggling to temper the global
growth of Chinese tech firms, which they fear could give Beijing a
critical edge in cyber competition.]{.underline}

"[[China has made **significant progress**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in
bolstering its capabilities]{.underline} since 2014, [[but nowhere near
enough to close the gap with the U.S]{.underline}]{.mark}.," said IISS
Senior Fellow for Cyber, Space and Future Conflict Greg Austin. "The
main reason is the relative standing of the two nations' digital
economies, where the U.S. remains far advanced despite China's digital
progress."

#### Sharing vulnerabilities weakens the United States cyber-capabilities \-\-- China will exploit

**[Aitel & Rampersaud 14]{.underline}** \-\-- Dave Aitel is CEO of
Immunity Inc., a leading offensive security firm that serves major
financial institutions, industrials, Fortune/Global 500s and US
government/military agencies. He is a former NSA computer scientist and
DARPA contractor. Skylar Rampersaud is a former NSA computer scientist
and director of vulnerability analysis at Immunity., "Some People Want A
Time Limit On The NSA\'s \'Zero-Day\' Exploits --- Here\'s Why That\'s A
Terrible Idea", Jul 2, 2014,
https://www.businessinsider.com/why-a-time-limit-on-zero-days-is-a-bad-idea-2014-7

In particular, [[people have suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} that the NSA
be restrained from collecting a "zero-day" stockpile and that one of the
logical ways to do this [[was to]{.mark} force them to [report]{.mark}
any [discovered vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} to the vendor for
patching after a certain time period has elapsed, presumably so they
could use them in the meantime for intelligence collection.

First, some context from the White House's NSA task force and their own
blog:

Recommendation 30: "US policy should generally move to ensure that Zero
Days are quickly blocked, so that the underlying vulnerabilities are
patched on US Government and other networks. In rare instances, US
policy may briefly authorize using a Zero Day for high priority
intelligence collection, following senior, interagency review involving
all appropriate departments."

"[[But there are legitimate]{.mark} pros and [cons to the **decision to
disclose**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and the trade-offs
between]{.underline}]{.mark} **[prompt
[disclosure]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and **withholding
knowledge**]{.underline}]{.mark} of some vulnerabilities for a limited
time [[can have **significant consequences**]{.underline}. [Disclosing a
vulnerability can mean that we **forego an opportunity to collect
crucial intelligence that could thwart a**]{.underline}]{.mark}
terrorist **[[attack]{.mark} stop]{.underline}** the **[[theft
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** our nation's **[[i]{.mark}ntellectual
[p]{.mark}roperty, [or]{.mark} even [discover more dangerous
vulnerabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}** that are being used by hackers or
other adversaries to exploit our networks."

However, people with experience in the field of information operations,
computer and network exploitation, or any related signals intelligence
occupation know that assigning a time limit to your methods is madness.

Specifically, computer and network operations are fragile in the sense
that they are often linked together. Take one simple sample operation
for example: penetrating the Iranian nuclear establishment.

This may involve at a minimum three different kinds of 0days
(penetrating into a computer, taking full control of that computer, and
spreading from that computer to other computers), but it also involves
special software for maintaining a presence on the network and getting
large volumes of data out of the network (think FLAME). These tools are
known as "implants."

[Obviously, [the first time someone discovers the implant, they can hunt
down all other machines that have been infected]{.mark} and start making
guesses as to what information you were after, or may have gotten. [This
is why the **minute** you become aware that someone has found you, you
clean up every possible operation]{.mark}]{.underline} using that
implant.

What is less well known is how the discovery of vulnerability
information ("0days") can affect operations. In particular, the modern
age of cloud computing allows countries to store and analyze huge
volumes of their traffic (or indeed, other countries' traffic, as
Snowden has helpfully pointed out). This means that [[when a
vulnerability goes public they can search through all of history to find
out when any traffic matching that vulnerability may have
happened]{.mark}. They then rush to look at that machine, and will
likely find any implant on it.]{.underline}

[[In other words, **releasing a vulnerability**]{.underline} [means that
**all of your implants**]{.underline}]{.mark} in Iran **[[must be
removed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [if any of them were installed using that
vulnerability]{.underline}. In addition, [hard targets are often
compromised with the help of **[human agents]{.mark}, recruited by human
intelligence organizations**]{.underline}. [These people's **[lives
are]{.mark} then [put at risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} any computer they have touched is discovered
to have been compromised by [[a tool that can be linked back to the
United States or]{.mark}]{.underline} her [[Allies]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In addition, [[you are not just releasing the information that the
vulnerability exists. If you are giving that vulnerability
info]{.mark}rmation]{.underline} to the vendor, [[you are also saying
that it was **definitely the United States**]{.mark} **government [that
was involved with that operation.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[This
**solves**]{.mark} **the "[attribution]{.mark} problem" [for your
enemy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[But [it solves more difficult problems for your enemy too. Software
bugs are often related]{.mark}, and the knowledge that a bug exists can
lead them to find different bugs]{.underline} in the same code or
similar bugs in other products. [[By looking at all the vulnerabilities
you release, they know the state of your vulnerability]{.mark}-finding
[programs]{.mark}. They know how far ahead or behind of you they are.
They can focus their own vulnerability-finding resources with greater
precision. They will be able to find vulnerabilities that you have not
found - and they will have the added advantage of knowing when to wrap
up their own exploit operations.]{.underline}

[[Vulnerabilities are a **finite thing**]{.underline} - [taking the tack
of releasing them]{.underline}]{.mark} over time [[means]{.mark} that
[eventually the United States' ability to find them will be **heavily
drained, but China's will not**]{.mark}]{.underline}, much like
exhausting an oil reserve.

Even if we ignore the problem of adversarial nation-states gaining an
advantage in vulnerability research, the discussion of a limited-use
window appears based on a non-existent thing: a static set of
intelligence priorities. The idea being presented is that the NSA would
find a vulnerability, use it for some amount of time to exploit its
"high priority" intelligence targets, then send it off to be patched.

This ignores the fact that [intelligence priorities can change rapidly
and often, hindering]{.underline} NSA's [ability to respond rapidly to
world events. In addition, computer network operations are continuous
things that often involve waiting for windows of opportunity\--something
that is incompatible with many of your tools having a time-limited
lifespan.]{.underline}

Integrating 0days into a toolkit, testing them and using them may cost
millions of dollars before it pays off with valuable intelligence. Keep
in mind as well, that not all 0days pay off, and any can be discovered
and destroyed in an instant and you have the very picture of a resource
you can't afford to waste.

Because of the interconnected nature of the entire computer and network
exploitation framework, [[forcing]{.underline}]{.mark} the NSA to
[[report]{.underline}]{.mark} vulnerabilities to vendors [[would force
it to **give up using vulnerabilities altogether.**]{.underline} [This
is not]{.underline}]{.mark} a considered and [[wise]{.underline}]{.mark}
action, even in light of Snowden's revelations.

[[The]{.mark} Deterrence Operations]{.underline} Joint Operation Guide
(DOJOC) [defines deterrence as the ability to "Convince adversaries to
not take action that threaten US vital interests by means of decisive
influence over their decision making]{.underline} ... [\[to\] change the
decision calculus of an adversary by denying benefits, imposing costs,
or encouraging adversary restraint]{.underline}."13 [[One method to
deter is the cyber domain is through a forward-deployed
presence]{.underline}]{.mark}. The US Cyber Command ([[USCYBERCOM) has
included the concept as a central focus through **superiority through
persistence**]{.underline}]{.mark}.14 [[The goal is to deploy as close
to the adversary]{.mark} activity as possible, [allowing the **research
of weaknesses**]{.mark}, intentions, capabilities, [and ability to
counter-attack]{.mark}.]{.underline}15 [USINDPACOM]{.underline}
reinforces a cyber alliance with the ROK, Japan, and Australia to
include information sharing and cyber attack response commitments.16 It
lists the Philippines as a nation that the US will support specifically
in an armed attack in the South China Sea.17 However, it [does not
mention Taiwan or cyber attacks]{.underline}. [Forward deploying in
cyberspace assumes that the US can act in cyberspace while controlling
escalation and the persistence will deter others from cyber
attacks.]{.underline}

[[Forward deployed troops allow for the normalization of cyber
operations, which decreases the risk of escalatory response in a
conflict situation.]{.mark} The decision to forward deploy in cyberspace
includes cyber protection teams, operations within allied networks,
operations against adversary networks, intelligence sharing with
allies]{.underline} and partners[, and using malware to set up critical
national infrastructure]{.underline} [to be effected.]{.underline}

[[The US must forward deploy troops]{.underline} [because of the
organizational decision to support Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}. The 2017
National Security Strategy included Taiwan and stated the US would
provide for Taiwan's legitimate defense needs and help deter coercion.18
The Interim National Security Strategy Guidance reaffirmed that
guarantee, including comments that Taiwan is a democracy and critical
economic and security partner in line with American commitments.19 [The
US values democracy]{.underline}, human rights, and human dignity as the
basis for all top-level doctrine and strategies. [Each document includes
spreading and securing democracy as part of its core mission. [In a
cyber event with China, China could stifle the]{.mark} fundamental right
to freedom of [information]{.mark} or speech [through]{.mark} a DDoS
attack]{.underline} as was seen in Hong Kong [or [a **zero-day
attack**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that could have strategic-level effects
on critical national infrastructure]{.underline}. **[The US must deter
Chinese aggression towards Taiwan]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[as aligned
with their diplomatic pledge.]{.underline}**

#### Taiwan invasion causes nuclear war

international media outlets. DW is an unbiased media organization, based
in Germany. We provide our journalistic content to people worldwide,
giving them the freedom to make up their own minds and the information

ignores,\" DW,
https://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-the-threat-that-the-world-ignores/a-54944934,
Accessed: 1-21-2021, MB

Taiwan\'s Foreign Minister Joseph Wu is ringing the alarm, hoping that
the world will pay attention to the profound threat emanating from
China.

[\"[The threat]{.mark} is very [real]{.mark}]{.underline} and therefore
Taiwan\'s preparation is also very serious,\" he told DW. \"We are
trying to deal with the military threat, day in and day out.\"

[[China\'s aggressive military probing]{.mark} has been going on for
years]{.underline} --- an unending stress test for the democratic island
it claims as its territory.

[But [in **2020**]{.mark}**, the threat [has taken on a new
intensity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Over and over again, Taiwan has had
to scramble fighters to intercept Chinese warplanes flying towards or
even into Taiwan\'s airspace]{.underline}.

With China cracking down on freedoms in Hong Kong, accused of sweeping
repression against the Uighurs in Xinjiang, expanding in the South China
Sea, and clashing with India in the Himalayas, Taiwan is asking: Are we
next?

In a new in-depth film DW lays bare the risks to this highly vulnerable
and yet thriving society, and examines three possible scenarios with
strategy and military experts from Taiwan, China, the US and Germany.

The underestimated threat

[China is completely open about the threat. President Xi Jinping framed
it himself in a high-profile speech in 2019: \"We do not promise to
renounce the use of force and reserve the option to use all necessary
measures.\"]{.underline}

Yet this threat to Taiwan receives little international attention.

\"[To say that [the world has **underestimated the severity of this
flashpoint**]{.mark} and that [there\'s]{.mark} [the **potential for war
over Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [I think itself is an
underestimation]{.underline},\" said Ian Easton of the Project 2049
Institute in Washington, DC, and author of \"The China Invasion
Threat.\"

James Fanell, former intelligence chief for the US Pacific Fleet,
agrees: \"2020 to 2030 is the most dangerous time on earth, in my
opinion, for a conflict with China over these disputed territories.\"

Taiwan exposed

Despite flourishing into a vibrant, high-tech democratic society since
its split from mainland China at the end of the civil war in 1949,
Taiwan is highly exposed.

Just 15 countries around the world recognize it as an independent state.
It is frozen out of international bodies like the UN and the World
Health Organization. And with a population of under 24 million, it is
dwarfed by China.

[Crucially, the military gap between China and Taiwan widens every
year.]{.underline}

Washington supplies Taipei\'s armed forces in line with defense
commitments made after it switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing in
1979. But those commitments are highly ambiguous. They stipulate that
Washington maintain \"the military capability in the West Pacific to
prevent intimidation and coercion against Taiwan,\" said Bonnie Glaser
of the Center for International and Strategic Studies in Washington, DC.

\"Notably, that is not a commitment to come to Taiwan\'s defense in the
event that it is attacked,\" Glaser said.

China\'s military might

[[China\'s threat to Taiwan is **backed by vast military
power**]{.underline}. [It has spent decades amassing the resources to
follow through]{.underline}]{.mark} [--- pouring massive investment into
its naval forces, even overtaking the US.]{.underline}

[\"For the last five years plus, they\'ve been [producing literally five
times as many ships per year as]{.mark} [the US Navy]{.mark}
produces]{.underline},\" said former Intelligence Chief James Fanell.
\"My projection is that the Chinese Navy by 2030 will have over 550
ships and submarines, and the United States Navy is still struggling to
figure out how to get to 350-355.\"

Key here is not only the size of the fleet but the type of ships Beijing
is building and the forces that work with them. [[China\'s new
generation]{.mark} of amphibious [warfare vessels, coupled]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} an expanded marine corps, would play a critical role in a
possible invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.

Outgunning the United States

[[China\'s array of anti-ship missiles]{.mark} is another part of the
arsenal. \"They\'ve developed this cornucopia of missile systems
designed specifically to defeat our Navy,\"]{.underline} said Fanell.

China is the world leader in this technology. \"They have anti-ship
cruise missiles like the YJ-18, which has a range that\'s longer than
anything that the United States has right now,\" said Fanell. \"And they
have anti-ship ballistic missiles that were specifically designed to go
after US Navy aircraft carriers.\"

[These weapons [are precisely what China would need to **deter**]{.mark}
**--- or repel --- [a US intervention]{.mark} to defend
Taiwan.**]{.underline}

[\"[Even five years ago, the ability of the United States]{.mark} [to
come to Taiwan\'s defense]{.mark} [was greater]{.mark} than it is
today,\"]{.underline} said Bonnie Glaser[. \"[It has **eroded over the
last decade**]{.mark}. And that is, I think, problematic.\"]{.underline}

Scenarios

So what could actually happen?

In the new film DW examines three possible scenarios in detail:
gradually chipping away at Taiwan\'s stability via military and hybrid
means; a sudden, Crimea-style annexation of outlying islands; and
finally a full-scale invasion.

[[An invasion would]{.mark} [involve]{.mark} [enormous risks not]{.mark}
just to Taiwan]{.underline}, but to the whole world. The US would face
the dilemma of whether to intervene **[--- potentially [sparking a war
between two superpowers]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

\"[[Everything that happens]{.mark} in this scenario [happens **under
the shadow of**]{.mark} **a potential [nuclear
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,\"]{.mark} Easton told DW. \"[[Every
decision]{.mark} that was made every minute, every day of a crisis or
[once a crisis escalates to war;]{.mark} you would never know when
things **[could spin out of control]{.mark}**.\"]{.underline}

The world is not ready

Ian Easton says that this last, [most dangerous scenario could arise
from internal [turbulence in China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"[You could imagine all kinds of disasters that that could occur that
[would **put pressure on the central leadership to get people to rally
around the flag**]{.mark}. And of course, at that point, Taiwan is an
obvious one, **[especially if it\'s not clear that the United States is
committed to Taiwan\'s defense]{.mark}.\"**]{.underline}

[A period of [political instability in the US]{.mark} --- such as a
contested presidential election result as feared this year --- **[could
open a window of opportunity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And Taiwan\'s
foreign minister, Joseph Wu, warned that conditions could converge in
China sooner than many expect.

[\"If you look at the internal situation in China at this moment, [the
economy has been affected by COVID-19]{.mark} and also the very serious
floods,]{.underline}\" he said. \"[Under these kinds of circumstances,
the [Chinese authoritarian leaders **may find Taiwan as a convenient
scapegoat**]{.mark}. Therefore Taiwan needs to be doubly concerned about
a possible Chinese use of force against us.\"]{.underline}

[The **preferred [U.S.]{.mark} style of warfare**]{.underline}---to
conduct [attacks **deep** throughout an enemy's territory]{.underline}
rather than simply meeting them at a forward line of engagement---also
presents problems and contains the prospect that non-nuclear strikes
[[might]{.mark} **unintentionally [trip]{.mark} Chinese
[redlines]{.mark}** [regarding]{.mark} **nuclear use**]{.underline}.
Within the U.S. academic community, this has produced a small, but
important body of literature focused on the subject of "entanglement,"
or [the **[co-mingling]{.mark} of [systems]{.mark}** with]{.underline}
both **[conventional and nuclear applications]{.underline}**.48 This
discussion has primarily focused [on China's **ballistic missile
force**]{.underline}, as [most]{.underline} of its [systems]{.underline}
are [capable of firing **both nuclear and non-nuclear
warheads**]{.underline}.49

[China's **increasing [reliance]{.mark}** [on **road**]{.mark}**-mobile
[ICBMs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (such as the DF-31 variants and the new
DF-41) [[complicates]{.mark} this problem, creating the potential for
their **mis[identification]{.mark}** as **shorter-range**]{.underline}
systems, such as the road-mobile DF-21 and DF-26, that might be used
against U.S. ships or regional bases.50 [Analysts]{.underline} have also
[expressed concern over the **potential for [U.S. forces]{.mark}** to
**[inadvertently sink a]{.mark} Chinese [SSBN]{.mark}**]{.underline} as
part of its ASW campaign [[during]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[Taiwan
conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}, a fear that echoes similar worries from
the U.S.-Soviet struggle.51 [Recall]{.underline} again the [**private
comments** of **Chinese officials** about [**conventional attacks** on
nuc]{.mark}lear system[s **nullify**]{.mark}**ing its [NFU]{.mark}
policy**]{.underline}.

THE POTENTIAL FOR MUTUAL MISCALCULATION

Entanglement issues are far from the whole of the problem. [[There
is]{.mark} **still a fundamental
[misreading]{.mark}**]{.underline}---perhaps [[on]{.mark} **both
sides**---[of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[ability to **manage
escalation** in **Taiwan**]{.mark} **contingencies** for reasons beyond
**strict operational matters**]{.underline}. The very fact of China
attempting something as complex and challenging as an amphibious
invasion of an island of 24 million people would show an unwelcome
tolerance for risk. For that matter, U.S. efforts to defend said
island---halfway around the world on another nuclear power's
doorstep---also shows a fair amount of audacity. Put differently, the
act of aggression against Taiwan and the effort to repel such an attack
both demonstrate that each side is willing to take actions which could
be viewed as inherently risky.

Through that lens, the additional step to [**[unwanted]{.mark} nuclear
[escalation]{.mark}** [is not a]{.mark} **great [leap]{.mark}**[. States
**act rationally**]{.mark}, **right up [until they do
not]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In considering how a Taiwan contingency
would play out, it would therefore be prudent to assume that nuclear use
is more viable than cold assessments of each side's pre-conflict
intentions suggest. If academic surveys of Chinese strategic literature
are correct, overoptimism on the ability to manage escalation once
hostilities commence is not confined to the U.S. side.52

[Ever wondered where [World War III might break
out]{.mark}?]{.underline}

**[A clear and troubling [consensus]{.mark}]{.underline}** has
[[emerged]{.underline}]{.mark} in the American national security
community [that the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait [is]{.mark} the **[most
likely]{.mark} place** [for a]{.mark} **major [war]{.mark}** to erupt
between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and

In March, the leading foreign policy organization in the United States,

that [Taiwan has become]{.mark} "[the **most dangerous

**[[troubling]{.underline}]{.mark}** set of **[[geopolitical

Republic of [[China and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates **[[more likely than ever]{.mark}
before]{.underline}**. Recently the newly appointed commander of U.S.
forces in the Indo-Pacific Region, Admiral John Aquilino, remarked that
[**a possible [invasion]{.mark} of Taiwan** by]{.underline} the People's

[The **horrendous global consequences** of a war between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China]{.underline}, most
likely [over [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, should preoccupy the Biden
team, beginning with the president. [It [could]{.mark}]{.underline} be
unlikely that a U.S.- China conflict would [[go
nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark} and Beijing has repeated its no first use
doctrine, but [there is **[little doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[China wants to **grow** its arsenal]{.underline}]{.mark} of a few
hundred warheads [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} build a more sophisticated
force that could [[employ **hypersonic**]{.mark} **glide
capabilitie[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.189 Millions of Americans could die
in the first war in human history between two nuclear weapons states. A
2015 RAND Corporation study of the effects of U.S.-China combat
determined that estimating military losses would be "exceedingly
difficult." World War II, however, was the last time the United States
lost a major warship, and one sunk vessel could turn into the deadliest
U.S. military event since the Vietnam War.190

The outbreak of [a **great power [war]{.mark}**
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[produce]{.mark} a **global
recession**, if **not a [depression]{.mark}**. It would
**[disrupt]{.mark}**]{.underline} Asian and [international [trade,
**sever**]{.mark}]{.underline} major [[supply chains]{.mark},
and]{.underline} could [**collapse** international]{.underline}
financial [systems]{.underline}.191 This would produce deeply painful
economic consequences for U.S. allies, who trade more with China than
they do with the United States. One study estimates that a single year
of U.S.-China conflict could cause American GDP to decline by 5 to 10
percent.192

China could unleash cyberattacks on the United States. The New York
Federal Reserve estimates that a major cyberattack on the U.S. financial
system could cause 2.5 times daily GDP in forgone payments, and a
Lloyd's of London and Cambridge University study predicted that a
hypothetical blackout affecting fifteen states could cause \$243 billion
to \$1 trillion in damages, as well as deaths resulting from disruption
to health care, traffic, and industry.193

In 2013, hackers associated with the PLA reportedly tried to infiltrate
companies that control U.S. critical infrastructure, including Telvent
which provides remote access and holds blueprints to North and South
American oil and gas pipelines.194 In 2019, researchers uncovered a
suspected Chinese plot to access American utility companies.195
Additionally, in September 2020, a ransomware attack said to have
originated in Russia hit U.S. hospitals during a coronavirus surge and
forced doctors to switch to pen and paper record keeping and postpone
certain medical procedures.196 The outbreak of U.S.-PRC conflict could
see multiple cyber events hit U.S. society and its allies in rapid
succession.197

[While Washington and Beijing were trading blows, [Russia could
**threaten the Baltics**, increase]{.mark} **its [presence]{.mark}** [in
Ukraine, or]{.mark} provide **oil and weapon [support]{.mark}** to
[China]{.mark}]{.underline}.198 [[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark} would be
[**[unlikely to stand idle]{.mark}** in the Middle East in **such a
crisis** [given **U.S. attention directed
elsewhere**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Another factor is the allied
dimension. In matters ranging from technology issues to criticism of
China's handling of Hong Kong, U.S. allies have sometimes been hesitant
to support Washington when American rhetoric and actions are deemed too
provocative or come with high economic costs.199 France and Germany
refused to support the United States in the 2003 Gulf conflict. In a
U.S.-China war, even Japan might not join the battle given its domestic
politics and constitutional constraints and the United States could well
fight alone, shattering its alliance system.

THIS BOOK is intended to help readers better understand the national
security issues facing the United States today and offer the general
outline of a strategy for dealing with
them. [National ]{.underline}[security
policy](https://muhaz.org/security-assurance-policy-helper-saph.html)---both
making it and debating it --- [is harder today because the issues that
are involved are more numerous and varied. [The problem]{.mark} of the
day [can **change at a moment\'s
notice**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Yesterday, it might have been
proliferation; today, terrorism; tomorrow, hostile regional powers.
Threats are also more likely to be
intertwined]{.underline}---proliferators use the same networks as
narco-traffickers, narco-traffickers support terrorists, and terrorists
align themselves with regional powers. Yet, as worrisome as these
immediate concerns may be, the long-term challenges are even harder to
deal with, and the stakes are higher. Whereas the main Cold War threat
--- the Soviet Union --- was brittle, [[most of the]{.mark} potential
[adversaries]{.mark} and challengers [America now faces are
resilient]{.mark}]{.underline}. In at least one dimension where the
Soviets were weak (economic efficiency, public morale, or leadership),
the new threats are strong. They are going to be with us for a long
time. As a result, we need to reconsider how we think about national
security. [[The most important task for U.S. national security]{.mark}
today [is]{.mark} simply **[to retain the strategic
advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This term, from the world of military
doctrine, refers to the overall ability of a nation to control, or at
least influence, the course of events.1 When you hold the strategic
advantage, situations unfold in your favor, and each round ends so that
you are in an advantageous position for the next. When you do not hold
the strategic advantage, they do not. As national goals go, "keeping the
strategic advantage" may not have the idealistic ring of "making the
world safe for democracy" and does not sound as decisively macho as
"maintaining American hegemony." But [[keeping the strategic advantage
is critical, because it is essential for just
about **everything**]{.mark} else America hopes to achieve ---
[promoting freedom, protecting the homeland, defending its
values]{.mark}, ]{.underline}preserving[** [peace]{.mark}**[, and so
on]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Changing Threat If one needs proof of this
new, [dynamic
environment](https://muhaz.org/dynamic-adaptation-of-parallel-codes-toward-self-adaptable-com-v2.html),
consider the recent record. A search of the media during the past
fifteen years suggests that there were at least a dozen or so events
that were considered at one time or another [the most pressing national
security problem]{.underline} facing the United States --- and thus the
organizing concept for U.S. national security. What is most interesting
is how varied and different the issues were, and how many different sets
of players they involved --- and how each was replaced in turn by a
different issue and a cast of characters that seemed, at least for the
moment, even more pressing. They [included]{.underline}, roughly in
chronological order, [• [regional conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
like Desert Storm --- involving the threat of war between conventional
armies; • [[stabilizing "failed states]{.underline}]{.mark}" like
Somalia, where government broke down in toto; • staying economically
competitive with Japan; [• [integrating Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} into
the international community after the fall of communism
and [[controlling]{.mark} ]{.underline}the [[nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} it inherited from the Soviet Union; [•
[dealing with "rogue states]{.mark}]{.underline}," unruly nations like
North Korea that engage in trafficking and proliferation as a matter of
national policy; [• [combating]{.mark} international
[crime]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the scandal involving the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International, or imports of illegal drugs; [•
[strengthening]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} for
trade as countries in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America adopted
market economies; • responding to ethnic conflicts and civil wars
triggered by the reemergence of culture as a political force in the
"clash of civilizations"; • providing relief to millions of people
affected by natural catastrophes like earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons,
droughts, and the spread of HIV/AIDS and malaria; •
combating [[terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} driven by sectarian or
religious extremism; • grassroots activism on a global scale, ranging
from the campaign to ban land mines to antiglobalization hoodlums and
environmentalist crazies; • border security [and illegal
immigration](https://muhaz.org/immigration-politics--cal-2013--starter-packet.html);
• the worldwide [ripple effects of currency fluctuations and the
collapse of confidence in complex financial securities]{.underline}; and
• for at least one fleeting moment, the safety of toys imported from
China. There is some overlap in this list, and one might want to group
some of the events differently or add others. The important point,
however, is that when you look at these problems and how they evolved
during the past fifteen years, you do not see a single lesson or
organizing principle on which to base U.S. strategy. Another way to see
the dynamic nature of today\'s national security challenges is to
consider the annual threat briefing the U.S. intelligence community has
given Congress during the past decade. These briefings are essentially a
snapshot of what U.S. officials worry most about. If one briefing is a
snapshot, then several put together back to back provide a movie,
showing how views have evolved.2 Figure 1 summarizes these assessments
for every other year between 1996 and 2006. It shows when a particular
threat first appeared, its rise and fall in the rankings, and in some
cases how it fell off the chart completely. So, in 1995, when the public
briefing first became a regular affair, the threat at the very top of
the list was North Korea. This likely reflected the crisis that had
occurred the preceding year, when Pyongyang seemed determined to develop
nuclear weapons, Bill Clinton\'s administration seemed ready to use
military action to prevent this, and the affair was defused by an
agreement brokered by Jimmy Carter. Russia and China ranked high as
threats in the early years, but by the end of the decade they sometimes
did not even make the list. Proliferation has always been high in the
listings, although the particular countries of greatest concern have
varied. Terrorism made its first appearance in 1998, rose to first place
after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and remains there
today. The Balkans appeared and disappeared in the middle to late 1990s.
A few of the entries today seem quaint and overstated. Catastrophic
threats to information systems like an "electronic Pearl Harbor" and the
"Y2K problem" entered the list in 1998 but disappeared after 2001.
(Apparently, after people saw an airliner crash into a Manhattan
skyscraper, the possible loss of their Quicken files seemed a lot less
urgent.) Iraq first appeared in the briefing as a regional threat in
1997 and was still high on the list a decade later---though, of course,
the Iraqi problem in the early years (suspected weapons of mass
destruction) was very different from the later one (an insurgency and
internationalized civil war). [[All this is why the United
States **needs agility**]{.mark}. It not only must be able to refocus
its resources repeatedly; it [needs to do this **faster than an
adversary can** focus its own resources]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Given the clear offensive potential of]{.mark} zero-day
[vulnerabilities, governments **actively collect
these**]{.mark}]{.underline} software flaws [in order [to **build up
their cyber-arsenals**]{.mark}**.** In the US]{.underline}, for example,
the National Security Agency (NSA) actively attempts to identify and
collect zero-days for the purpose of tailored access operations (TAO).
In 2013 alone, the [NSA]{.underline} reportedly [spent \$25 million
purchasing zero-day vulnerabilities]{.underline} (EPIC, 2018). While TAO
have clear espionage and even outright offensive purposes in some
situations[, [the threat of using zero-days]{.underline}]{.mark} [as a
retaliatory measure in the eventuality of a cyberattack **[readily
contributes to the nation's cyber deterrent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
this sense, [[the collection of zero-day vulnerabilities by government
agencies]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the NSA [[can be viewed as
**increasing the potential for deterrence**]{.mark} **by threat of
retaliation and punishment.**]{.underline}

The focus on the private sector is essential, since the overwhelming
majority of network and information systems are privately owned and
operated, and most EU member states have not yet adopted the necessary
conditions to enable effective vulnerability disclosure by businesses
(Pupillo et al. 2018). Nonetheless, as noted previously, [[government
agencies are]{.mark} also actively [involved in the search for]{.mark}
zero-day [vulnerabilities which they can
**stockpile**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and use for **military
purposes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. EU [member states with known offensive
programs]{.underline} include the Netherlands, Sweden, France and
Germany (Healey 2016). However, to date, most EU member states have not
taken active steps to establish GDDP processes similar to the VEP in the
US, and [[little information is available about how they handle the
knowledge]{.mark} of vulnerabilities in their possession]{.underline}
(Delcheva and Soesanto 2018). According to Marietje Schaake, former
Chair of the CEPS Task Force, "[[we know]{.underline}]{.mark} that
\[European\] intelligence **[[agencies have been stockpiling
vulnerabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[...\]. At the moment there's
often a lack of oversight \[...\] [intelligence agencies can roughly
decide for themselves \[whether or not [to disclose]{.mark} a newly
discovered vulnerability]{.underline}\] without proper accountability"
(Marietjeschaake.eu 2018). Yet, [due to an **inherent conflict of
interests**]{.underline}, as demonstrated by the role of the NSA in the
US, these circumstances can hardly lead to optimal results. The [absence
of a vulnerability review process [runs the risk of **exposing unpatched
vulnerabilities to adversary countries and criminal groups, weakening
regional cybersecurity.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Nuclear or conventional weapons, once developed, can remain dormant yet
functional until needed. In comparison, the **[[zero-days
used]{.mark}]{.underline}** in cyber weapons [[**require the US to
constantly discover new vulnerabilities to maintain a deployable cyber
arsenal**. Holding a specific zero-day does not guarantee that the
vulnerability will remain unpatched]{.mark} for a prolonged period of
time by the targeted state.]{.underline}59 Complicating this is the fact
that undetected vulnerabilities, once acquired, are rarely used
immediately given the time and resources it takes to construct a cyber
attack.60 In the time between acquisition and use, a patch for the
vulnerability may be released, whether through routine patches or a
specific identification of a security hole, rendering the vulnerability
obsolete. To minimize this, [[America deploys several zero-days at once
in a cyber attack to increase the odds that at least one]{.mark} (or
more) of the vulnerabilities [remains open to provide system
access]{.mark}.6 2.4.]{.underline}

[One Attack, Multiple Vulnerabilities]{.underline}

[[Multiple backdoor entry points are preferable given that America
cannot be absolutely certain of what vulnerabilities the target system
will contain]{.mark}62]{.underline} despite extensive pre-launch cyber
attack testing63 and customization.64 [[A successful cyber attack needs
a minimum of one undetected vulnerability]{.mark} to gain access to the
target system. Each successive zero-day that works adds to the strength
and sophistication of a cyber assault.]{.underline}65 As one
vulnerability is patched, America can still rely on the other undetected
vulnerabilities to continue its cyber strike. [[Incorporating multiple
**undetected** vulnerabilities into a cyber attack reduces the need to
create new cyber attacks after each zero-day fails.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Stuxnet]{.underline}, a joint US-Israel operation, [was a cyber attack
designed to disrupt Iran's progress on its nuclear weapons
program.]{.underline}66 The attack was designed to alter the code of
Natanz's computers and industrial control systems to induce "chronic
fatigue," rather than destruction, of the nuclear centrifuges.67 The
precision of Stuxnet ensured that all other control systems were ignored
except for those regulating the centrifuges.68

[What is notable about Stuxnet is its use of four zero-day exploits (of
which one was allegedly purchased)69 in the attack.]{.underline}70 That
is, [to target one system, Stuxnet entered through four different
backdoors.]{.underline} A target state aware of a specific vulnerability
in its system will enact a patch upon detection and likely assume that
the problem is fixed. [Exploiting multiple vulnerabilities creates
variations in how the attack is executed given that different backdoors
alter how the attack enters the target system.71 One patch does not stop
the cyber attack.]{.underline} The use of multiple zero-days thus
capitalizes on a state's limited awareness of the vulnerabilities in its
system.

Each phase of Stuxnet was different from its previous phase which
created confusion among the Iranians. Launched in 2009, Stuxnet was not
discovered by the Iranians until 2010.72 [Yet even upon the initial
discovery of the attack, who the attacker was remained unclear. The
failures in the Natanz centrifuges were first attributed to insider
error73 and later to China]{.underline}74 before finally discovering the
true culprits.75 The use of multiple undetected vulnerabilities helped
to obscure the US and Israel as the actual attackers.76

**[[The Stuxnet case helps illustrate the efficacy of zero-day attacks
as a means of attaining political goals.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Although
Stuxnet did not produce immediate results in terminating Iran's nuclear
program, it helped buy time for the Americans to consider other options
against Iran. A nuclear Iran would not only threaten American security
but possibly open a third conflict for America77 in the Middle East
given Israel's proclivity to strike a nuclear Iran first. Stuxnet
allowed the United States to delay Iran's nuclear program without
resorting to kinetic action.78

can direct its security apparatus to develop
counter-capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The United States, through the Department of Homeland Security, has
launched both passive and active cyber sensors to detect network
intrusions. EINSTEIN 2, the passive sensor, was launched in 2008 to
detect network intrusions.168 Building on the capabilities of EINSTEIN 2
was EINSTEIN 3, an active sensor designed to provide realtime threat
detection capable of stopping known malware before it reaches the
targeted government network.169 Passive [[defences "scan, firewall, and
patch" in an attempt to protect a system. These
defences]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[have little utility against
sophisticated cyber]{.mark} [attacks]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as
Stuxnet, [or against attacks employing zero-days.]{.underline}
[**[Active defences]{.mark},** in comparison, build on passive defences
to try and stop the cyber attack]{.underline}170 [but the success rates
of such measures in the US security architecture remains
unknown]{.underline}.171 [In reality, the EINSTEIN systems only detect
and (in the case of EINSTEIN 3) [stop known malware entering through
known vulnerabilities]{.mark}.172 **[Nevertheless]{.mark}**, [every
vulnerability subsequently discovered through **attack
absorption**]{.mark} [allows]{.mark} EINSTEIN 3 to erect [new cyber
barriers in its systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[A cyber-capable adversary may undertake multiple attempts to create
sustained access to a target]{.mark} system or network]{.underline}.173
[[**Absorbing the initial attack** becomes necessary to find and fix the
exploited vulnerability to avert subsequent
strikes]{.mark}.]{.underline} If only the first intrusion succeeds, the
attacker will be forced to adjust its strike strategy to reopen the
system access it once had. By erecting cyber obstacles, one is able to
discourage weaker actors from exploiting the same vulnerability before
it is patched. Adapting from vulnerabilities to defensive barriers may
not stop cyber attacks altogether but it can frustrate cyber-capable
states from "easily succeeding in \[...subsequent\] attacks."174

Allowing a [[cyber attack]{.mark},]{.underline} while counterintuitive,
[[allows the US to gather valuable information on its attacker]{.mark}.
By identifying how an attacker got into an American system or network
and what information was sought, [the US is positioned to **better
understand not only its vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but
also the capabilities and intentions of its adversaries]{.underline}.
**[Resiliency through attack absorption diminishes the prospect of
long-term disruption to American networks]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [As a
result, [the benefits to an attacker diminish]{.mark}.]{.underline}175

#### Secrecy is key to effective cyber deterrence and response

John **[Mowchan 11]{.underline}**, Lt Col, October, "Don't Draw the
(Red) Line,"
http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2011-10/dont-draw-red-line

[Those arguing for]{.underline} establishing [red lines fail to
comprehend the complexity of the digital domain, in which [**adaptation
and anonymity are the norm**. The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is
better served in the long run by not establishing]{.mark} such
[thresholds]{.mark}, for four reasons. [First, not doing so allows
government leaders the latitude to **tailor response options**]{.mark}
**based on a hostile act**, its physical and digital effects, and how it
relates to the current state of affairs in the international
system]{.underline}. As retired Air Force General Kevin Chilton remarked
in 2009 as commander, U.S. Strategic Command, "I don't think you take
anything off the table when you provide \[response\] options to the
president to decide. Why would we constrain ourselves on how we would
respond \[to hostile acts in cyberspace\]?" 15 [Such an approach does
not differ from the way the United States addresses hostile acts in
other domains. [If red lines are established, we will be compelled to
respond to each threat that crosses the line, which is
unrealistic]{.mark},]{.underline} given that our computer networks are
subjected to millions of probes, scans, and attacks on a daily basis.
[Even if red lines are narrowly focused]{.underline} (e.g., employing
military force if a cyber attack results in the deaths of U.S.
citizens), [the first time the United States fails to respond
accordingly, **[it will undermine the credibility and deterrence
effect]{.mark}**]{.underline} of our other capabilities. [[A]{.mark}
second [reason in favor of ambiguity is that **if our adversaries know
our response to such acts, they will adjust
accordingly**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Because neither the national nor
the defense strategy explicitly defines a hostile act in cyberspace or
exactly how the United States will respond, this leaves it open to
interpretation.]{.underline} As one military official remarked, "If you
shut down our power grid, maybe we will put a missile down one of your
smokestacks." 16 In addition, [hostile actors may perceive a green light
for certain acts that do not cross a particular response
threshold.]{.underline} While one such act below this threshold may not
be harmful to U.S. interests, what if 100 million are? Again,
[[maintaining ambiguity]{.mark} concerning when, how, and [to what
extent to respond **gives the U**]{.mark}**nited [S]{.mark}tates
[greater latitude]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Third, [because cyberspace is
a global domain]{.underline} [that emphasizes open access, the free flow
of information, and anonymity, **[it is extremely difficult to determine
where the threat]{.mark} or attack [originated]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
For example, U.S. military networks are probed more than six million
times a day by assailants operating in one corner of the world using
computer networks or servers in another corner. [Most perpetrators are
never identified]{.underline}, except for a computer Internet protocol
address or a one-time user alias. Army General Keith Alexander,
commander of U.S. Cyber Command and Director, National Security Agency,
emphasized this challenge, saying, "[Too often, the military discovers
through forensics that network probes have been successful \[and\] as a
consequence, **[response becomes policing up after the fact versus
mitigating it real time]{.mark}**]{.underline}." 17 If red lines demand
a timely response and there is no one to pin responsibility on, then how
can a response be implemented? Finally, even if the source of the
attacks is determined in a timely manner, automatic triggers for a
response, particularly those that employ military force, could create
negative second- and third-order effects that make a bad situation even
worse. Given that nation states pose the greatest threat to U.S.
networks, red lines that automatically result in a response could
escalate an already volatile situation. For example, in 2009 individuals
in China and Russia penetrated computer networks operating parts of the
U.S. electrical power grid. 18 They reportedly inserted malware that
could destroy infrastructure components. Although their identities or
associations with the Russian and Chinese governments were not
disclosed, it validates the point that response options must be
tailored. If Russia or China, two nuclear powers, were responsible, a
U.S. response would be markedly different than if they had they been
conducted by a non-nuclear state. Clearly the diplomatic, information,
and economic instruments of national power versus military force would
receive more emphasis with China or Russia for what could be considered
a hostile act in cyberspace. Given the complex and indeterminate 21st
century international system and the multitude of current threats, U.S.
interests will be better served by not establishing clear thresholds[.
[Ambiguity is a powerful tool]{.mark} to shape our adversaries' actions
in all domains [and allows us **the maneuverability to respond**]{.mark}
**where, when, and how we choose.**]{.underline} Red-line advocates must
understand that thresholds only constrain our actions and could
undermine credibility and the power to effectively deter our
adversaries.

That was then. [Much of the cyber talk around the Pentagon these days is
about offensive operations. It is no longer enough for [cyber
troops]{.mark} to be deployed along network perimeters, desperately
trying to block the constant attempts by adversaries to penetrate front
lines. The US military's]{.underline} geek [warriors [are]{.mark} now
[prepared to]{.mark} go on the [attack]{.mark}, armed [with]{.mark}
potent [cyberweapons that can break into enemy computers]{.mark} with
pinpoint precision.]{.underline} The new emphasis is evident in a
program launched in October 2012 by the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA), the Pentagon's experimental research arm. DARPA
funding enabled the invention of the Internet, stealth aircraft, GPS,
and voice-recognition software, and the new program, dubbed Plan X, is
equally ambitious. [DARPA managers said the Plan X goal was "to create
revolutionary technologies for understanding, planning, and managing
cyberwarfare."]{.underline} The US Air Force was also signaling its
readiness to go into cyber attack mode, announcing in August that it was
looking for ideas on how "to destroy, deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive,
corrupt, or usurp the adversaries \[sic\] ability to use the cyberspace
domain for his advantage." The new interest in attacking enemies rather
than simply defending against them has even spread to the business
community. Like their military counterparts, cybersecurity experts in
the private sector have become increasingly frustrated by their
inability to stop intruders from penetrating critical computer networks
to steal valuable data or even sabotage network operations.
[[The]{.mark} new [idea is to pursue the perpetrators back into their
own networks]{.mark}. "We're following a failed security strategy in
cyber,"]{.underline} says Steven Chabinsky, formerly the head of the
FBI's cyber intelligence section and now chief risk officer at
CrowdStrike, a startup company that promotes aggressive action against
its clients' cyber adversaries. ["[There's no way that we are going to
win]{.mark} the cybersecurity effort [on defense]{.mark}. **[We have to
go on offense]{.mark}**."]{.underline} The growing interest in offensive
operations is bringing changes in the cybersecurity industry. Expertise
in patching security flaws in one's own computer network is out;
expertise in finding those flaws in the other guy's network is in.
[Among the "hot jobs" listed on the career page at the National Security
Agency are openings for computer scientists who specialize in
"vulnerability discovery."]{.underline} Demand is growing in both
government and industry circles for technologists with the skills to
develop ever more sophisticated cyber tools, including malicious
software---malware---with such destructive potential as to qualify as
cyberweapons when implanted in an enemy's network. ["[Offense is the
biggest growth sector]{.mark} in the cyber industry right
now,"]{.underline} says Jeffrey Carr, a cybersecurity analyst and author
of Inside Cyber Warfare. But have we given sufficient thought to what we
are doing? Offensive operations in the cyber domain raise a host of
legal, ethical, and political issues, and governments, courts, and
business groups have barely begun to consider them. The move to
offensive operations in cyberspace was actually under way even as
Pentagon officials were still insisting their strategy was defensive. We
just didn't know it. The big revelation came in June 2012, when New York
Times reporter David Sanger reported that the United States and Israel
were behind the development of the [Stuxnet]{.underline} worm, which had
been used to damage computer systems controlling Iran's nuclear
enrichment facilities. Sanger, citing members of President Obama's
national security team, said the attacks were code-named Olympic Games
and [constituted "America's first sustained use of
cyberweapons."]{.underline} The highly sophisticated Stuxnet worm
delivered computer instructions that caused some Iranian centrifuges to
spin uncontrollably and self-destruct. According to Sanger, the secret
cyber attacks had begun during the presidency of George W. Bush but were
accelerated on the orders of Obama. The publication of such a highly
classified operation provoked a firestorm of controversy, but government
officials who took part in discussions of Stuxnet have not denied the
accuracy of Sanger's reporting. "He nailed it," one participant told me.
[In the aftermath of the Stuxnet revelations, discussions about cyber
war became more realistic and less theoretical. Here was a cyberweapon
that had been designed and used for the same purpose and with the same
effect as a kinetic weapon]{.underline}: like a missile or a bomb, it
caused physical destruction. Security experts had been warning that a US
adversary could use a cyberweapon to destroy power plants, water
treatment facilities, or other critical infrastructure assets here in
the United States, but [[the Stuxnet story showed]{.mark} how the
[American military]{.mark} itself [could use an offensive cyberweapon
against an enemy]{.mark}. The advantages of such a strike were obvious.
A [cyberweapon could take down computer networks and even destroy
physical equipment]{.mark} without the civilian casualties that a
bombing mission would entail.]{.underline} Used preemptively, it could
keep a conflict from evolving in a more lethal direction. [The targeted
country would have a hard time determining where the cyber attack came
from.]{.underline} In fact, the news that the United States had actually
developed and used an offensive cyberweapon gave new significance to
hints US officials had quietly dropped on previous occasions about the
enticing potential of such tools. In remarks at the Brookings
Institution in April 2009, for example, the then Air Force chief of
staff, General Norton Schwartz, suggested that cyberweapons could be
used to attack an enemy's air defense system. ["Traditionally," Schwartz
said, "we take down integrated air defenses via kinetic means. But if it
were possible to interrupt radar systems or surface to air missile
systems via cyber, that would be another very powerful tool in the tool
kit allowing us to accomplish air missions."]{.underline} He added, ["We
will develop that---have \[that\]---capability."]{.underline} A full two
years before the Pentagon rolled out its "defensive" cyber strategy,
Schwartz was clearly suggesting an offensive application. The Pentagon's
reluctance in 2011 to be more transparent about its interest in
offensive cyber capabilities may simply have reflected sensitivity to an
ongoing dispute within the Obama administration. Howard Schmidt, the
White House Cybersecurity Coordinator at the time the Department of
Defense strategy was released, was steadfastly opposed to any use of the
term "cyber war" and had no patience for those who seemed eager to get
into such a conflict. But his was a losing battle. [[Pentagon planners
had already classified cyberspace officially as a fifth "domain]{.mark}"
of warfare, alongside land, air, sea, and space.]{.underline} As the
2011 cyber strategy noted, that designation "allows DoD to organize,
train, and equip for cyberspace as we do in air, land, maritime, and
space to support national security interests." That statement by itself
contradicted any notion that the Pentagon's interest in cyber was mainly
defensive. [Once the US military accepts the challenge to fight in a new
domain, it aims for superiority in that domain over all its rivals, in
both offensive and defensive realms. Cyber is no exception.]{.underline}
The US Air Force budget request for 2013 included \$4 billion in
proposed spending to achieve "cyberspace superiority," according to Air
Force Secretary Michael Donley. It is hard to imagine the US military
settling for any less, given the importance of electronic assets in its
capabilities. Even small unit commanders go into combat equipped with
laptops and video links. "We're no longer just hurling mass and energy
at our opponents in warfare," says John Arquilla, professor of defense
analysis at the Naval Postgraduate School. "Now we're using information,
and the more you have, the less of the older kind of weapons you need."
Access to data networks has given warfighters a huge advantage in
intelligence, communication, and coordination. But their dependence on
those networks also creates vulnerabilities, particularly when engaged
with an enemy that has cyber capabilities of his own. "Our adversaries
are probing every possible entry point into the network, looking for
that one possible weak spot," said General William Shelton, head of the
Air Force Space Command, speaking at a CyberFutures Conference in 2012.
"If we don't do this right, these new data links could become one of
those spots." Achieving "cyber superiority" in a twenty-first-century
battle space is analogous to the establishment of air superiority in a
traditional bombing campaign. Before strike missions begin against a set
of targets, air commanders want to be sure the enemy's air defense
system has been suppressed. Radar sites, antiaircraft missile batteries,
enemy aircraft, and command-and-control facilities need to be destroyed
before other targets are hit. Similarly, when an information-dependent
combat operation is planned against an opposing military, the
operational commanders may first want to attack the enemy's computer
systems to defeat his ability to penetrate and disrupt the US military's
information and communication networks. Indeed, operations like this
have already been carried out. A former ground commander in Afghanistan,
Marine Lieutenant General Richard Mills, has acknowledged using cyber
attacks against his opponent while directing international forces in
southwest Afghanistan in 2010. "I was able to use my cyber operations
against my adversary with great impact," Mills said, in comments before
a military conference in August 2012. "I was able to get inside his
nets, infect his command-and-control, and in fact defend myself against
his almost constant incursions to get inside my wire, to affect my
operations." Mills was describing offensive cyber actions. This is cyber
war, waged on a relatively small scale and at the tactical level, but
cyber war nonetheless. And, as DARPA's Plan X reveals, the US military
is currently engaged in much larger scale cyber war planning. DARPA
managers want contractors to come up with ideas for mapping the digital
battlefield so that commanders could know where and how an enemy has
arrayed his computer networks, much as they are now able to map the
location of enemy tanks, ships, and aircraft. Such visualizations would
enable cyber war commanders to identify the computer targets they want
to destroy and then assess the "battle damage" afterwards. Plan X would
also support the development of new cyber war architecture. The DARPA
managers envision operating systems and platforms with "mission scripts"
built in, so that a cyber attack, once initiated, can proceed on its own
in a manner "similar to the auto-pilot function in modern aircraft."
None of this technology exists yet, but neither did the Internet or GPS
when DARPA researchers first dreamed of it. As with those innovations,
[the government role is to fund and facilitate]{.underline}, but much of
the experimental and research work would be done in the private sector.
A computer worm with a destructive code like the one Stuxnet carried can
probably be designed only with state sponsorship, in a research lab with
resources like those at the NSA. But private contractors are in a
position to provide many of the tools needed for offensive cyber
activity, including the [[software bugs that can be **exploited** to
provide a "back door" into a computer's operating system]{.mark}.
Ideally, [the]{.mark} security flaw or [vulnerability]{.mark} [that can
be exploited]{.mark} for this purpose will [be one of which the]{.mark}
network [operator]{.mark} **[is totally unaware]{.mark}**. Some [hackers
specialize in finding these vulnerabilities]{.mark}, and as the interest
in offensive cyber operations has grown, so has the demand for their
services.]{.underline} The world-famous hacker conference known as
Defcon attracts a wide and interesting assortment of people each year to
Las Vegas: creative but often antisocial hackers who identify themselves
only by their screen names, hackers who have gone legit as computer
security experts, law enforcement types, government spies, and a few
curious academics and journalists. One can learn what's hot in the
hacker world just by hanging out there. In August 2012, several
attendees were seated in the Defcon cafe when a heavy-set young man in
jeans, a t-shirt, and a scraggly beard strolled casually up and dropped
several homemade calling cards on the table. He then moved to the next
table and tossed down a few more, all without saying a word. There was
no company logo or brand name on the card, just this message: "Paying
top dollar for 0-day and offensive technologies . . . " The card
identified the buyer as "zer0daybroker" and listed an e-mail address.
[[A "zero-day" is the most **valuable of computer
vulnerabilities**]{.mark}, [one unknown to anyone but the researcher who
finds it]{.mark}. [**Hackers prize zero-days** because]{.mark} **[no one
knows to have prepared a defense against them]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The growing demand for these tools has given rise to brokers like
Zer0day, who identified himself in a subsequent e-mail exchange as "Zer0
Day Haxor" but provided no other identifying information. As a broker,
he probably did not intend to hack into a computer network himself but
only to act as an intermediary, connecting sellers who have discovered
system vulnerabilities with buyers who want to make use of the tools and
are willing to pay a high price for them. In the past, the main market
for these vulnerabilities was software firms themselves who wanted to
know about flaws in their products so that they could write patches to
fix them. Big companies like Google and Microsoft employ "penetration
testers" whose job it is to find and report vulnerabilities that would
allow someone to hack into their systems. In some cases, such companies
have paid a bounty to freelance cyber researchers who discover a
vulnerability and alert the company engineers. But [the rise in
offensive cyber operations has transformed the vulnerability market, and
hackers these days are more inclined to sell zero-days to the highest
bidder. In most cases, these are governments. [The market for back-door
exploits has been boosted]{.mark} in large part by the burgeoning demand
from militaries eager to develop their cyber warfighting
capabilities.]{.underline} The designers of the Stuxnet code cleared a
path into Iranian computers through the use of four or five separate
zero-day vulnerabilities, an achievement that impressed security
researchers around the world. The next Stuxnet would require the use of
additional vulnerabilities. [**"**If the president asks [the US
military]{.mark} to launch a cyber operation in Iran tomorrow, it's not
the time to start looking for exploits," says Christopher Soghoian, a
Washington-based cybersecurity researcher. "They **[need to have the
exploits ready to go]{.mark}**. And you may not know what kind of
computer your target uses until you get there. **[You need a whole
arsenal \[of vulnerabilities\]]{.mark}** ready to go in order **[to
cover every possible configuration you may meet]{.mark}**."]{.underline}
Not surprisingly, [the National Security Agency]{.underline}---buying
through defense contractors---[may well be the biggest customer in the
vulnerability market, largely because it pays handsomely. [The US
military's dominant presence in the market means]{.mark} that other
possible **[purchasers cannot match the military's price]{.mark}**.
"Instead of telling Google or Mozilla about a flaw and getting a bounty
for two thousand dollars, researchers will sell it to a defense
contractor like Raytheon or SAIC and get a hundred thousand for
it,]{.underline}" says Soghoian, now the principal technologist in the
Speech, Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties
Union and a prominent critic of the zero-day market. "Those companies
will then turn around and sell the vulnerability upstream to the NSA or
another defense agency. They will outbid Google every time."

["[If there is a war, and the Chinese shut down the power

"great difficulties" as well as widespread panic among people.

"[[If we got a cyberwar]{.mark}, then all these systems are down," Huang
said]{.underline}. "If the communication node is broken, then **[[it

At the same time, [[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [regards cyber
war during armed conflict with a cyber-capable enemy
as]{.mark}]{.underline} probable, if not [**[inevitable]{.mark}**. It
both assumes that the computer systems on which its own forces rely to
deploy, receive support and strike will be attacked, and intends to
attack the computer systems that enable opposing forces to operate as
well.]{.underline} Thus, [the United States has said that it can and
would]{.underline} conduct cyber war to 'support operational and
contingency plans' -- a euphemism for [attacki]{.underline}ng [computer
systems that enable enemy war fighting. US military doctrine now
regards]{.underline} 'non-kinetic' (that is, [cyber]{.underline})
[measures as an integral aspect of US joint offensive
operations.]{.underline}8 Even so, the stated purposes of the US
military regarding cyber war stress protecting the ability of
conventional military forces to function as they should, as well as
avoiding and preventing escalation, especially to non-military targets.
Apart from its preparedness to conduct counter-military cyber operations
during wartime, the United States has been reticent about using its
offensive capabilities. While it has not excluded conducting cyber
operations to coerce hostile states or non-state actors, it has yet to
brandish such a threat.9 [Broadly speaking, [US policy is to rely on the
threat of retaliation to deter a form of warfare it is keen to
avoid]{.mark}.]{.underline} Chinese criticism that the US retaliatory
policy and capabilities 'will up the ante on the Internet arms race' is
disingenuous in that China has been energetic in forming and using
capabilities for cyber operations.10 Chinese criticism is disingenuous
Notwithstanding the defensive bias in US attitudes toward cyber war, the
dual missions of deterrence and preparedness for offensive operations
during an armed conflict warrant maintaining superb, if not superior,
offensive capabilities. Moreover, the case can be made -- and we have
made it -- that **[[the United States should have superiority in
offensive capabilities in order to control
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.11 The combination of significant
capabilities and declared reluctance to wage cyber war raises a question
that is not answered by any US official public statements: when it comes
to offence, what are US missions, desired effects, target sets and
restraints -- in short, what is US policy? [To be clear, we do not take
issue with the basic US stance of being at once wary and capable of
cyber war. Nor do we think that the United States should advertise
exactly when and how it would conduct offensive cyber war.]{.underline}
However, the very fact that the United States maintains options for
offensive operations implies the need for some articulation of policy.
After all, the United States was broadly averse to the use of nuclear
weapons during the Cold War, yet it elaborated a declaratory policy
governing such use to inform adversaries, friends and world opinion, as
well as to forge domestic consensus. Indeed, if the United States wants
to discourage and limit cyber war internationally, while keeping its
options open, it must offer an example. For that matter, the American
people deserve to know what national policy on cyber war is, lest they
assume it is purely defensive -- or just too esoteric to comprehend.
Whether to set a normative example, warn potential adversaries or foster
national consensus, US policy on waging cyber war should be coherent. At
the same time, it must encompass three distinguishable offensive
missions: wartime counter-military operations, which the United States
intends to conduct; retaliatory missions, which the US must have the
will and ability to conduct for reasons of deterrence; and coercive
missions against hostile states, which could substitute for armed
attack.12 Four cases serve to highlight the relevant issues and to
inform the elaboration of an overall policy to guide US conduct of
offensive cyber war. The first involves wartime counter-military cyber
operations against a cyber-capable opponent, which may also be waging
cyber war; the second involves retaliation against a cyber-capable
opponent for attacking US systems other than counter-military ones; the
third involves coercion of a 'cyber-weak' opponent with little or no
means to retaliate against US cyber attack; and the fourth involves
coercion of a 'cyber-strong' opponent with substantial means to
retaliate against US cyber attack. Of these, the first and fourth imply
a willingness to initiate cyber war. Counter-military cyber war during
wartime Just as cyber war is war, armed hostilities will presumably
include cyber war if the belligerents are both capable of and vulnerable
to it. The reason for such certainty is that impairing opposing military
forces' use of computer systems is operationally compelling. Forces with
requisite technologies and skills benefit enormously from data
communications and computation for command and control, intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), targeting, navigation, weapon
guidance, battle assessment and logistics management, among other key
functions. If the performance of forces is dramatically enhanced by such
systems, it follows that degrading them can provide important military
advantages. Moreover, allowing an enemy to use cyber war without
reciprocating could mean military defeat. Thus, [[the United States and
other advanced states are acquiring capabilities not only to use and
protect computer systems, but also to disrupt those used by
enemies]{.mark}. The intention to wage cyber war is now prevalent in
Chinese planning for war with the United States -- and vice versa.
[Chinese military planners have long made known their belief that,
because computer systems are essential]{.mark} for effective US military
operations, [they must be targeted. Chinese cyber capabilities may not
(yet) pose a threat]{.mark} to US command, control, communications,
computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR)
networks, which are well partitioned and protected. [However, the
networks that enable logistical support for US forces are inviting
targets.]{.mark}]{.underline} Meant to disable US military operations,
[[Chinese use of cyber war]{.mark}]{.underline} during an armed conflict
[[would not be contingent on US cyber operations. Indeed, it could come
early]{.mark}, first or even as a precursor of armed hostilities. For
its part, [the US military is increasingly aware]{.mark} not only that
sophisticated adversaries like [China can be expected to use cyber war
to **degrade**]{.mark} the performance of [**US forces**,]{.mark} but
also that US forces must integrate cyber war into their capabilities and
operations**.**]{.underline} Being more dependent on computer networks
to enhance military performance than are its adversaries, including
China, US forces have more to lose than to gain from the outbreak of
cyber war during an armed conflict. This being so, would it make sense
for the United States to wait and see if the enemy resorts to cyber war
before doing so itself? [[Given US conventional military superiority, it
can be assumed that any adversary that can use cyber war against US
forces will do so]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, waiting for the other
side to launch a cyber attack could be disadvantageous insofar as US
forces would be the first to suffer degraded performance. Thus, rather
than waiting, there will be pressure for the United States to commence
cyber attacks early, and perhaps first. Moreover, leading US military
officers have strongly implied that cyber war would have a role in
attacking enemy anti-access and area-denial (A2AD) capabilities
irrespective of the enemy's use of cyber war.13 If the United States is
prepared to conduct offensive cyber operations against a highly advanced
opponent such as China, it stands to reason that it would do likewise
against lesser opponents. In sum, offensive cyber war is becoming part
and parcel of the US war-fighting doctrine. [The nature of US
counter-military cyber attacks during wartime should derive from the
mission of gaining, or denying the opponent, operational
advantage.]{.underline} Primary targets of the United States should
mirror those of a cyber-capable adversary: ISR, command and control,
navigation and guidance, transport and logistics support. Because this
mission is not coercive or strategic in nature, economic and other
civilian networks should not be targeted. However, to the extent that
networks that enable military operations may be multipurpose, avoidance
of non-military harm cannot be assured. There are no sharp 'firebreaks'
in cyber war.14

WASHINGTON: **[[Because China believes it is]{.mark} much
[weaker]{.mark} than the United States, [they are more likely to launch
a massive preemptive strike]{.mark}]{.underline}** in a crisis. Here's
the other bad news: [[The current US concept for high-tech
warfare]{.underline},]{.mark} known as Air-Sea Battle, [[might
escalate]{.underline}]{.mark} the conflict even further towards a
"limited" nuclear war, says one of the top American experts on the
Chinese military. \[This is one in an occasional series on the crucial
strategic relationship and the military capabilities of the US, its
allies and China.\] What US analysts call an "anti-access/area denial"
strategy is what China calls "counter-intervention" and "active
defense," and [the Chinese approach is born of a deep sense of
vulnerability that dates back 200 years,]{.underline} China analyst
Larry Wortzel said at the Institute of World Politics: ["The People's
Liberation Army still sees themselves as an inferior force to the
American military, and that's who they think their most likely enemy
is."]{.underline} That's fine as long as it deters China from attacking
its neighbors. But [[if deterrence fails, the Chinese are likely to **go
big or go home**]{.mark}. Chinese military history from the Korean War
in 1950 to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam in 1979 to more recent,
albeit vigorous but non-violent, grabs for the disputed Scarborough
Shoal suggests a preference for a sudden use of overwhelming force at a
crucial point]{.underline}, what Clausewitz would call the enemy's
"center of gravity." "What they do is very heavily built on preemption,"
Wortzel said. ["The problem with the striking the enemy's center of
gravity is, for the United States, they see it as being in Japan,
Hawaii, and the West Coast....That's very escalatory."]{.underline}
(Students of the American military will nod sagely, of course, as we
remind everyone that President George Bush made preemption a centerpiece
of American strategy after the terror attacks of 2001.) Wortzel argued
that the current version of US Air-Sea Battle concept is also likely to
lead to escalation. "China's dependent on these ballistic missiles and
anti-ship missiles and satellite links," he said. Since those are almost
all land-based, any attack on them "involves striking the Chinese
mainland, which is pretty escalatory." "You don't know how they're going
to react," he said. "They do have nuclear missiles. They actually think
we're more allergic to nuclear missiles landing on our soil than they
are on their soil. They think they can withstand a limited nuclear
attack, or even a big nuclear attack, and retaliate." What War Would
Look Like [So [how would China's preemptive attack
unfold?]{.mark}]{.underline} First would come [weeks of escalating
rhetoric and cyberattacks. [There's no evidence the Chinese favor a
"bolt out of the blue]{.mark}" without giving the adversary what they
believe is a chance to back down]{.underline}, agreed retired Rear Adm.
Michael McDevitt and Dennis Blasko, former Army defense attache in
Beijing, speaking on a recent Wilson Center panel on Chinese strategy
where they agreed on almost nothing else. That's not much comfort,
though, considering that Imperial Japan showed clear signs they might
attack and still caught the US flat-footed at Pearl Harbor. [[When the
blow does fall, the experts believe it would be sudden. Stuxnet-style
viruses]{.mark},]{.underline} electronic jamming, and Israeli-designed
Harpy radar-seeking cruise missiles (similar to the American HARM but
slower and longer-ranged) **[[would try to blind every land-based and
shipborne radar]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Long-range anti-aircraft
missiles like the Russian-built S-300 would go for every plane currently
in the air within 125 miles of China's coast, a radius that covers all
of Taiwan and some of Japan. Salvos of ballistic missiles would strike
every airfield within 1,250 miles. That's enough range to hit the four
US airbases in Japan and South Korea -- which are, after all, static
targets you can look up on Google Maps -- to destroy aircraft on the
ground, crater the runways, and scatter the airfield with unexploded
cluster bomblets to defeat repair attempts. Long-range cruise missiles
launched from shore, ships, and submarines then go after naval vessels.
And if the Chinese get really good and really lucky, they just might get
a solid enough fix on a US Navy aircraft carrier to lob a
precision-guided ballistic missile at it. But would this work? Maybe.
"This is fundamentally terra incognita," Heritage Foundation research
fellow Dean Cheng told me. There has been no direct conventional clash
between major powers since Korea in the 1950s, no large-scale use of
anti-ship missiles since the Falklands in 1982, and no war ever where
both sides possessed today's space, cyber, electronic warfare, and
precision-guided missile capabilities. Perhaps the least obvious but
most critical uncertainty in a Pacific war would be invisible. ["I don't
think we've seen electronic warfare on a scale that we'd see in a
US-China confrontation," said Cheng. "I doubt very much they are behind
us when it comes to electronic warfare, \[and\] the Chinese are training
every day on cyber: all those pings, all those attacks, all those
attempts to penetrate."]{.underline} While the US has invested heavily
in jamming and spoofing over the last decade, much of the focus has been
on how to disable insurgents' roadside bombs, not on how to counter a
high-tech nation-state. [[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[has
focused its electronic warfare and cyber attack efforts on the United
States.]{.mark} Conceptually, [China may well be ahead of us in linking
the two]{.mark}.]{.underline} (F-35 supporters may well disagree with
this conclusion.) Traditional radar jammers, for example, can also be
used to insert viruses into the highly computerized AESA radars (active
electronically scanned array) that are increasingly common in the US
military. ["[Where there has been a fundamental difference, and perhaps
the Chinese are better than we are at this, is the Chinese seem to have
kept cyber and electronic warfare as a single integrated
thing]{.mark},"]{.underline} Cheng said. "We are only now coming round
to the idea that electronic warfare is linked to computer network
operations." In a battle for the electromagnetic spectrum, Cheng said,
[[the worst case "is that you thought your jammers, your
sensors]{.mark}, everything was [working]{.mark} great, **[and the next
thing you know missiles are penetrating \[your defenses]{.mark}**\],
planes are being shot out of the sky."]{.underline}

Can the United States and China escape Thucydides Trap? While
international relations experts grapple with the question whether the
two powers are destined for war, a storm seems to be gathering in the
Asia-Pacific, and it seems increasingly clear where lightning might
strike. Considering recent developments, [[the Taiwan Straits
seems]{.mark} to be [the **most likely battleground for**]{.mark}
**[Sino-American conflict]{.mark}. [The prospect]{.mark} of conflict
[appears to be looming]{.mark}** as Beijing closes in on Hong Kong and
ratchets up its rhetoric on a forceful reunification with
Taiwan.]{.underline}

[[China has backed its statements on]{.mark} "the Chinese dream of
national rejuvenation" with a substantial increase in military activity
surrounding Taiwan]{.underline}. It has conducted an unprecedented
amount of more than ten military and transit exercises in close
proximity to Taiwan in 2020. Additionally, China's air force made an
incursion into Taiwanese airspace for the first time in 20 years. Since
then, it has done so an accumulative number of times[. A former top
military official of Taiwan commented that Beijing might be [looking to
provoke a military reaction by Taipei]{.mark}, which could give them a
casus belli for an invasion.]{.underline}

Weakness is Provocative

[These developments come as [Taiwan's defence and resolve have
withered]{.mark}, which has been exacerbated by the Sino-American
military balance of power having shifted in favour of
China]{.underline}. Taiwan has grown complacent under the security
umbrella. It scrapped its mandatory conscription in 2018, and its
overall defence strategy of late makes little military sense. Instead of
focussing its limited defence budget on creating an effective defence
force tailored towards Chinese offensive capabilities, it has
concentrated on trying to match China in more traditional and expensive
weapon systems; such as tanks, fighter jets, and submarines. At the same
time, Washington does not seem to be capable of ensuring Taiwan's
defence. Senior US Defence officials have revealed that the US would no
longer win in a war against China; especially not one over the defence
of Taiwan.

[Such a development is particularly concerning due to [the
centralisation of Chinese decision]{.mark}-[making]{.mark}. China,
**[under Xi Jinping]{.mark}, [has noticeably]{.mark} become [more
assertive]{.mark} and less risk-averse**]{.underline}. [Xi reportedly
seems to be making important decisions himself. An erosion of checks and
balances is worrying since [it **could easier lead to undaunted
actions**]{.mark} **[regarding a forceful reunification]{.mark} with
Taiwan**.]{.underline} [This concern is compounded **[by Beijing
possibly being encouraged by an increasingly isolationist
US]{.mark}.**]{.underline} After all, Russia met relatively little
resistance when it invaded Georgia and Ukraine. A Beijing insider
informed reporter Evan Osnos that [Xi had told people that he was
impressed by Putin's annexation of Crimea. Meanwhile, Xi might also be
emboldened by his own endeavours]{.underline}, as a result of the
marginal resistance China met in regards to its tightening control over
Hong Kong. [[China's]{.mark} ambitious and unconstrained [leader **might
figure that today's**]{.mark} **strategic [conditions are as ripe
as]{.mark} will probably [ever]{.mark} be for the remainder of his
leadership**.]{.underline} [[Thus, he might **seize the
opportunity**]{.mark} **[to]{.mark} personally [restore China's former
glory by forcefully reuniting with Taiwan sooner rather than
later.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

### Terminal \-\-- China / Taiwan

#### Taiwan goes nuclear 

**[Lowther 13 --]{.underline}** William Lowther, Taipei Times, citing a
report by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, 3/16/13,
"Taiwan could spark nuclear war: report,"
<http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2013/03/16/2003557211>

[[Taiwan is the]{.underline} [most likely]{.underline}]{.mark}
[potential [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} [[that could]{.underline}
[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [nuclear war]{.mark}]{.underline}
[between China and the US]{.underline}, a new academic report
concludes.¶ "Taiwan remains the single most plausible and dangerous
source of tension and conflict between the US and China," says the
42-page report by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and
International Studies (CSIS).¶ Prepared by the CSIS' Project on Nuclear
Issues and resulting from [a year-long study]{.underline}, the report
[emphasizes]{.underline} that [[Beijing continues to be]{.underline}
[set]{.underline}]{.mark} [on a policy [to prevent]{.mark} Taiwan's
[independence]{.mark},]{.underline} [while]{.underline} at the same time
[the US maintains the capability to come to Taiwan's
defense]{.underline}.¶ "Although tensions across the Taiwan Strait have
subsided since both Taipei and Beijing embraced a policy of engagement
in 2008, [[the situation remains combustible]{.underline}]{.mark},
[complicated [by]{.mark}]{.underline} [[rapidly diverging]{.mark}
cross-strait [military capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} [and persistent
political disagreements]{.underline}," the report says.¶ In a footnote,
it quotes senior fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations Richard
Betts describing Taiwan as "the main potential flashpoint for the US in
East Asia."¶ The report also quotes Betts as saying that [neither
Beijing nor Washington can fully control developments that might ignite
a Taiwan crisis]{.underline}.¶ "[[This is a]{.underline}]{.mark} classic
[[recipe for]{.underline}]{.mark} surprise, [[miscalc]{.mark}ulation
[and]{.mark} uncontrolled [escalation]{.mark}]{.underline}," Betts wrote
in a separate study of his own.¶ The CSIS study says: "For the
foreseeable future [[Taiwan is]{.mark} the contingency in which nuclear
weapons would most likely become a major factor]{.underline},
[because]{.underline} the fate of [the island is
[intertwined]{.mark}]{.underline} both [[with the legitimacy of the
C]{.underline}]{.mark}hinese [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ommunist
[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}arty [and the reliability of US defense
commitments]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific region."¶ Titled Nuclear
Weapons and US-China Relations, the study says disputes in the East and
South China seas appear unlikely to lead to major conflict between China
and the US, but they do "provide kindling" for potential conflict
between the two nations because the disputes implicate a number of
important regional interests, including the interests of treaty allies
of the US.¶ The danger posed by flashpoints such as Taiwan, the Korean
Peninsula and maritime demarcation disputes is magnified by the
potential for mistakes, the study says.¶ "[Although Beijing and
Washington have]{.underline} agreed to [a range of crisis management
mechanisms,]{.underline} such as the Military Maritime Consultative
Agreement and the establishment of a direct hotline between the Pentagon
and the Ministry of Defense, [the [bases for miscommunication]{.mark}
and misunderstanding [remain]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and draw
on]{.underline} [deep]{.underline}]{.mark} [historical reservoirs of
[suspicion]{.mark}]{.underline}," the report says.¶ For example, it
says, [it is unclear whether either side understands what kinds of
actions would result in a military or]{.underline} even [nuclear
response]{.underline} [by the other]{.underline} party.¶ To make things
worse, "[[neither]{.mark} side [seems to believe the other's]{.mark}
declared policies and [intentions]{.mark}]{.underline},
[suggesting]{.underline} that [[escalation
management]{.underline}]{.mark}, already a very uncertain endeavor,
[[could be]{.underline} [especially difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} in
any conflict," it says.¶ Although conflict "mercifully" seems unlikely
at this point, the report concludes that "it cannot be ruled out and may
become increasingly likely if we are unwise or unlucky."¶ The report
says: "[[With]{.mark} both sides possessing]{.underline} and looking set
to retain [[formidable nuclear]{.mark} weapons
[arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}, [such a [conflict would
be]{.mark}]{.underline} tremendously dangerous and quite possibly
[[devastating]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[A [war between China, Taiwan and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[has]{.mark} the [potential to escalate into]{.mark} a [nuclear conflict

#### China/Taiwan war goes nuclear

THE PROSPECTS for avoiding intense military competition and war may be
good, but growth in China\'s power may nevertheless require some changes
in U.S. foreign policy that Washington will find
disagreeable\--particularly regarding Taiwan. Although it lost control
of Taiwan during the Chinese Civil War more than six decades ago,
[China]{.underline} still [considers Taiwan]{.underline} to be [part of
its homeland,]{.underline} and unification remains a key political goal
for Beijing. [[China has made clear that it will use force if]{.mark}
[Taiwan declares independence]{.mark},]{.underline} and much of
[[China\'s]{.mark} conventional [military buildup has been
dedicated]{.mark} [to]{.mark}]{.underline} increasing its ability to
[coerce [Taiwan]{.mark} and reducing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates\' [ability to intervene]{.underline}. [[Because
China places such high value on Taiwan and]{.mark} because [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
China]{.underline}]{.mark}\--whatever they might formally agree
to\--[[have such different attitudes]{.underline}]{.mark} regarding the
legitimacy of the status quo, [[the issue poses special
dangers]{.underline}]{.mark} and challenges for the U.S.-Chinese
relationship, placing it in a different category than Japan or South
Korea. [[A crisis over Taiwan could]{.mark} fairly [easily escalate to
nuclear war]{.mark},]{.underline} because [[each step along the way
might]{.underline}]{.mark} well [[seem rational]{.mark} to the actors
involved.]{.underline} Current U.S. policy is designed to reduce the
probability that Taiwan will declare independence and to make clear that
the United States will not come to Taiwan\'s aid if it does.
Nevertheless, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [[would find itself under pressure to
protect Taiwan]{.mark} against any]{.underline} sort of [attack, no
matter how it originated.]{.underline} Given the different interests and
perceptions of the various parties and the limited control Washington
has over Taipei\'s behavior, a crisis could unfold in which the United
States found itself following events rather than leading them. Such
dangers have been around for decades, but [ongoing [improvements in
China\'s military capabilities may]{.mark} [make Beijing]{.mark} more
[willing to escalate a Taiwan crisis]{.mark}.]{.underline} In addition
to its improved conventional capabilities, [[China is modernizing its
nuclear forces to]{.mark} increase their ability to]{.underline} survive
and [[retaliate following a]{.mark} large-scale U[.S.
attack.]{.mark}]{.underline} Standard deterrence theory holds that
Washington\'s current ability to destroy most or all of China\'s nuclear
force enhances its bargaining position. [[China\'s]{.mark} nuclear
[modernization might remove that check on Chinese action, leading
Beijing to behave more boldly]{.mark} in future crises]{.underline} than
it has in past ones. [[A U.S. attempt to]{.mark} preserve its ability to
[defend Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, meanwhile, [[could fuel a]{.mark}
conventional and [nuclear arms race]{.mark}.]{.underline} Enhancements
to U.S. offensive targeting capabilities and strategic ballistic missile
defenses might be interpreted by China as a signal of malign U.S.
motives, leading to further Chinese military efforts and a general
poisoning of U.S.-Chinese relations.

A possible [Chinese blockade of Taiwan]{.underline}, on the other hand,
clearly [has]{.underline} even [high]{.underline}er [stakes, and history
suggests]{.underline} that [crises may]{.underline} again [occur in
connection with Taiwan]{.underline}[. [Beijing might **convince
itself**]{.underline}]{.mark} that **[[a
blockade]{.underline}]{.mark}**-centered operation [[against
Taiwan]{.mark}, designed [to **force it** to reverse]{.mark} whatever
**purportedly [offending action or rhetoric]{.mark}**]{.underline} had
[caused China's reaction]{.underline} in the first place, [[might not be
hugely risky]{.underline}.]{.mark} In principle, China could scale back
or suspend enforcement of the blockade at any point if it needed to, and
could do so while saving face, especially if the blockade was conducted
principally by submarines. Moreover, [Beijing might believe]{.underline}
that even [a]{.underline} partially [**effective naval blockade** could
be [a potent instrument of coercion against Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Such a blockade would almost assuredly be nowhere near complete or
airtight.84 However, China would not need to stop all commercial ships
transiting into and out of Taiwan. It would simply need to deter enough
ships from risking the journey that Taiwan's economy would suffer badly.
The goal would likely be to squeeze the island economically to the point
of capitulation. This solution might seem quite elegant from Beijing's
point of view: it could involve little or no loss of life, little or no
damage to Taiwan itself, and the ability to back off the attack if the
United States seemed prepared to intervene or if the world community
slapped major trade sanctions on China in response.[85 [In any such
blockade, China might]{.underline} [well combine various elements of
military power, including cyberattacks, into a multidimensional
operation]{.underline}]{.mark}.86 [It could attack command and control
as well as reconnaissance capabilities both on land and in
space]{.underline} (the latter intended largely to blind the United
States). The [centerpiece]{.underline} of the approach
[would]{.underline} probably [be the PRC submarine fleet introducing a
**significant risk factor** into]{.underline} all [maritime voyages into
and out of Taiwan by occasionally sinking a cargo ship]{.underline},
either with submarines or with mines it had laid in Taiwan's harbors.87
[The **PRC submarine force**]{.underline} has [improved by leaps and
bounds in recent decades]{.underline}. Over the past twenty years,
China's fleet of modern attack subs has grown from roughly two to
forty.88 [China's precision-strike capabilities]{.underline} have
[improved to the point that China could]{.underline} conceivably [use a
**preemptive missile and air attack** against Taiwanese airfields and
ports and associated infrastructure]{.underline} to hobble Taiwan's
ability to strike back, though it might choose not to attack Taiwan's
territory in the first instance.89 To allow humanitarian supplies to
reach Taiwan, Beijing might offer countries the option of first docking
in a PRC port for inspection before sailing to their destinations. In
this and other ways, it could limit the dangers to innocent civilians.
Since this strategy might require the Chinese submarine fleet to sink
only a few ships to achieve the desired aims, even in the worst case
Beijing might believe that it was acting humanely--- threatening the
lives of only 100 to 200 commercial seamen. [Given the perceived
stakes]{.underline} involved, [[Beijing could well consider this a
**reasonable risk**]{.underline}]{.mark}. If they chose [[to try to
break the blockade,]{.mark} the **basic**]{.underline} concept of
[**operations** for the United States and Taiwan would]{.underline}
probably [be to assemble enough forces]{.underline} in the western
Pacific [to set up a **protected shipping lane east of
Taiwan**]{.underline}. To carry out that mission, [the United States
would need to establish air superiority]{.underline} throughout a large
part of the region, together with Taiwan (and perhaps other countries
such as Japan). [The United States and Taiwan]{.underline}, and perhaps
others, [would also need to protect ships against Chinese **submarine
attack**]{.underline} while coping with the threat of mines near
Taiwan's ports. And [they might have to do all this without **assured
access to much of their satellite architecture**]{.underline},
especially for imagery and some types of signals intelligence. That is
because [China's abilities to shoot down]{.underline} or disable **[low
Earth orbit satellites]{.underline}**, through direct-ascent
interceptors or directed-energy weapons or other means, [have
improved]{.underline} in recent years (even as some aspects of U.S.
access to space have become more distributed and resilient as well).90
[[China]{.mark} [might]{.mark}]{.underline} well be willing to [[shoot
at **American satellites**]{.mark} [even if it
sought]{.mark}]{.underline}, at least initially, [[not to attack U.S.
ships or aircraft]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, [its
willingness]{.underline} to do the latter in addition [should not be
dismissed, in light of Taiwan's importance to Beijing]{.underline}. And
its willingness would likely grow very quickly after the first Chinese
submarine was sunk, which could happen if the U.S.-Taiwan
blockade-busting and convoy escort operation shot back at a PLA
submarine that had just attacked a cargo vessel. Escalation could happen
fast. Later in a conflict, [China might even consider using **nuclear
weapons** in such an attack, despite its official **no-first-use**
policy]{.underline}, as Columbia professor Thomas Christensen has
argued.91 [While the term "**surgical nuclear strike**" is]{.underline}
almost [oxymoronic and Strangelovian]{.underline}, to the extent it has
any faint resemblance to reality, [it is probably in a situation like an
**attack on a lone ship** at sea]{.underline}. [Establishing **air
superiority** has become much harder]{.underline} for the United States
and Japan in these kinds of scenarios [because of the PLA Air Force's
modernization trends in recent years, combined with]{.underline} the
**[limited options for basing U.S. aircraft]{.underline}** in the
region. Fortunately, modern U.S. stealthy or "fifth-generation" aircraft
are still far superior to Chinese planes. Unfortunately,
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[has]{.mark} close to [1,000
**"fourth-generation" fighters**]{.mark} roughly comparable to U.S.
aircraft]{.underline} such as the F-15 and F-16. And [it can base
perhaps 1,000 aircraft [within several hundred miles of
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [A RAND simulation
estimates]{.underline} that [[China might be able to **surge**]{.mark}
**about [half that]{.mark} number** [in an attack on Taiwan]{.mark} or
on the shipping around it]{.underline}, including a mix of air-to-air,
air-to-ground, and electronic-warfare planes. Using a basic model and
some simplifying assumptions, RAND estimates that the United States
could prevent such a surge force from reaching most of its targets only
by continuously keeping some two wings or about 150 aircraft airborne
near Taiwan. The United States and its partners would likely succeed in
such an effort because, according to RAND's model, the United States'
fifthgeneration aircraft---F-22s and F-35s, and to a lesser degree
F/A-18E/F Super Hornets---could have 50 percent more lethality and up to
90 percent less vulnerability than Chinese combat jets.92 But the
success would come at a price, and only with considerable effort and
difficulty. [China could **choose the time and place of its
surge**,]{.underline} and the United States (with any allies) would
therefore have to be vigilant at all times. It would need to keep
fighters airborne near Taiwan essentially for as long as the crisis
endured. It would also need the continued presence of airborne warning
aircraft in the vicinity. Bases on Okinawa are about 750 kilometers away
from Taiwan, or about an hour of flight time; aircraft carriers might be
kept roughly that close too. But other bases in the area---Misawa Air
Base on Japan's main Honshu island, Andersen Air Force base on Guam---
would be 2,500 kilometers or more distant, meaning some three hours of
flying each way to get to station and then return after flying a patrol.
If aircraft and crews are limited to a daily flight average of about six
hours a day, jets from Okinawa could average 1.5 sorties per day and
those from the more distant bases slightly less than one sortie per
twenty-four hours. That would translate into three hours a day on
station flying from Kadena and 1.5 hours a day flying from Guam or
Honshu. Put differently: Eight aircraft (plus or minus) based on Kadena
would be needed to sustain one on station near Taiwan. Sixteen aircraft
or so based at Misawa or Andersen Air Force Base would be needed to keep
one on station near Taiwan. Averaging this out, keeping two wings of
fighters aloft at a time could require about ten to twelve times that
number being based in the region, or twenty to twenty-four wings---more
than half the total U.S. military aggregate. (The RAND study actually
estimates that fourteen to thirty would be needed, depending on specific
assumptions; I have simplified the analysis above.93) Moreover, the
United States could lose a number of aircraft in this process, perhaps
even dozens. China could lose dozens or even hundreds. [The backdrop
would be set for escalation]{.underline}. [Both sides would be
increasingly tempted to attack the land bases and aircraft carriers from
which planes operated]{.underline}.94 Ballistic missiles and ballistic
missile defense would be important in this kind of engagement, too.
China now has missiles, such as the medium-range DF-21 in the Dong-Feng
series, that are capable of being fired from its homeland and reaching
ships east of Taiwan. [It is not clear whether the United States could
blind China's sensors]{.underline} adequately [to deprive the PLA of
targeting information]{.underline}. Any PLA attack against military
facilities in a place like Okinawa therefore could well shut down
runways for at least some stretch of time and destroy aircraft or
ordnance and fuel stocks not in underground areas or hardened
shelters.95 Again, [Chinese nuclear attacks against American and any
allied naval assets]{.underline} in the region [are hard to
dismiss]{.underline} categorically. The [antisubmarine
warfare]{.underline} (ASW) [effort could have multiple
aspects]{.underline}. The United States would probably be tempted to
deploy its own attack submarines as close as possible to
China---certainly in the Taiwan Strait, maybe just outside PRC ports.
This approach would provide American submarines a good prospect of
destroying PRC submarines at their source, before they were in position
to fire on commercial shipping (or U.S. aircraft carriers) in more
distant waters. However, this type of [ASW could be escalatory if it
involved attacks in Chinese territorial waters]{.underline}. Whatever
happened near Chinese shores, there would surely be additional layers of
American ASW farther out to sea. American ASW assets on ships and planes
would accompany convoys of merchant ships as they sailed in from the
open ocean waters east of Taiwan. These convoys might form a thousand
miles or more east of Taiwan and enjoy armed protection from that point
onward as they traveled to the island, and then later as they departed.
The ASW assets would use sonar to listen for submarines, and for the
sound of any torpedoes being fired. The United States would have to
deploy significant numbers of surface combatants and airplanes such as
P-3s and P-8s, as well as helicopters, to the region for this mission.
Some would help protect U.S. aircraft carriers east of Taiwan. Others
would provide additional protection to merchant ships or mine warfare
vessels as they operated near Taiwan's shores. Any Chinese submarine
wishing to fire a torpedo at a merchant ship or aircraft carrier would
then first have to run a gauntlet (if it were firing long-range antiship
missiles, it could avoid some of the gauntlet, but would depend on
targeting information provided by another platform). It would likely
have to evade submarine detection as it left port, avoid any openwater
search missions that the United States and Taiwan established, and then
somehow penetrate the defensive ASW perimeter of whatever convoy it was
attacking as it approached its target. To survive the overall engagement
and return to port, it would then need to successfully negotiate all of
this in the other direction. Unfortunately for Chinese submarines, this
would be risky business. Unfortunately for the United States, Taiwan,
and any other allies participating in the effort, it would also be risky
for their assets, and some would surely be lost in the operation. During
the Cold War, the effectiveness of ASW operations was commonly assessed
at 5 to 15 percent per barrier. (Cold War barriers were often more
linear and literal perimeters than would be likely here, but the fact
remains that Chinese submarines would have to survive perhaps three
types of pursuers on three different parts of their journey to or from
home base.) By those odds, the typical Chinese submarine would do well
to survive for two or three round-trip missions from base.96 But it
might succeed in getting off several shots against valuable, and
vulnerable, surface ships before meeting its own demise.97 A recent
major RAND study on the U.S.-China military balance concurred with this
broad result, especially in cases where Chinese submarines could be cued
by sensors to a general area where a target such as a U.S. aircraft
carrier might operate. In that case, a given submarine might have
multiple opportunities to get off shots at lucrative surface targets.98
China might hope that a quick strike that sank a major U.S. ship and
killed hundreds of Americans (or even thousands, in the event of a
carrier sinking) would cause Washington to waver in its future
commitment to the defense of Taiwan. [The United States might face
serious challenges in waters near Taiwan]{.underline} as well, [despite
the **proximity of land-based assets**]{.underline} that could join in
the ASW hunt. [Shallow waters are complex sonar environments in which
sound waves bounce back and forth in multiple and unpredictable
directions]{.underline}. [This makes ambush a real worry]{.underline},
especially for the mine warfare vessels and surface ships that would
have to escort commercial vessels all the way into Taiwan's ports.99
Toward a Net Assessment Where does this leave us? Although I have not
provided a detailed scenario analysis or combat modeling exercise here,
the broad contours of the situation drive home some central points. They
are also consistent with the more detailed modeling work of others, such
as RAND. [[Once a Chinese blockade operation]{.mark} against Taiwan
[began, it would be]{.mark} [difficult to]{.mark} be
confident]{.underline} that [it would [end without]{.mark} a
**[significant]{.mark} and [escalating conflict]{.mark}** [pitting the
United States, Taiwan, and]{.mark}]{.underline} perhaps [[Japan against
China]{.underline}]{.mark}. If that occurred, sustained naval, aerial,
and missile combat in and around Taiwan would likely lead to substantial
losses on all sides. American advantages in fifth-generation combat
aircraft and modern attack submarines would give the United States and
its partners in the operation a significant edge. However, that edge is
less than it used to be. China would clearly have the edge in geography,
and it also increasingly possesses good attack submarines and
precision-strike missiles as well. [Myriad uncertainties,
including]{.underline} the [**survivability of space and cyber
systems**, as well as ships and land bases, make it hard to be confident
in predicting outcomes]{.underline}. Indeed, when I modeled
uncertainties with respect to a possible U.S.- led invasion of Iraq in
2002, I produced a likely band of possible casualties in which higher
estimates were literally ten times greater than lower estimates. This
broad approach was eventually vindicated: it initially appeared, in
April 2003, that U.S. losses might be very modest, but over the course
of several years it became clear they were much higher. A U.S.- China
war would be far more uncertain. For most scenarios involving blockades
and other possible intense operations over and in the waters of the
western Pacific, the United States and allies could probably muscle
their way to victory over China at this point, as we approach 2020.
Taiwan could also likely endure the privations that would be experienced
during the military campaign before victory was assured.100 My best
guess is that [both sides would lose]{.underline} most [low-altitude
satellites and]{.underline} some [cyber as well as **command, control,
and communications capability**, so the war would]{.underline}
ultimately [be fought in a certain fog]{.underline}. Yet American
high-tech advantages in weapons platforms would ultimately provide an
important and probably decisive edge. This somewhat sanguine conclusion
is far from certain, however. It hinges in part on a willingness in
Washington to accept many thousands of American battlefield dead and at
least some risk of nuclear escalation. Even though U.S. nuclear forces
far exceed those of the PLA, [[China might conclude]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [its [disproportionate interests]{.mark} in the Taiwan issue
[warranted **nuclear brinkmanship**, especially if
China]{.mark}]{.underline} had [[already]{.mark} possibly [lost]{.mark}
thousands of [its own people]{.mark}]{.underline} in conventional
combat, [[which would **heighten the stakes**]{.mark} as well as the
**reputational importance** of the outcome of the conflict]{.underline}.
These [concerns could be amplified if the United States]{.underline},
intentionally or not, [began to strike]{.underline} the [**nuclear
assets** of the PLA in the course of conventional fighting near
Taiwan]{.underline}. If that happened, [[China might face a "use them or
lose them" dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}.101 Nuclear attack against a
carrier, or a high-altitude nuclear airburst over a base like Kadena
(designed to destroy people and equipment immediately below, without
generating lots of fallout), might seem particularly attractive options
to Beijing. Nuclear escalation might happen in another way as well.
[Perhaps China would **attempt a large-scale cyberattack** against the
United States]{.underline} (and quite possibly Japan too) in the course
of such a conflict. [Its hope might be]{.underline}, for example, [to
incapacitate the U.S. **electricity grid**]{.underline}---as National
Security Agency director Admiral Michael Rogers said in 2014 that China
might well be able to do. Such a result could badly incapacitate many of
the Defense Department systems in the United States that require
civilianproduced electricity to function.102 [Even if such systems could
be restored]{.underline} quickly, [the U.S. electrical
system]{.underline} as a whole [might remain damaged for many months, as
might **national infrastructure** needed to **deploy military forces**
abroad]{.underline}. Whether the United States could muster a major
military response at a time when its national capacities were needed to
take care of the many Americans left in the cold and dark, without
medicine or sanitation or clean water or viable living quarters, is an
open question. China might hope that U.S. military assets would be
devoted to missions closer to home, to prevent mass famine, privation,
or disease, after such a catastrophe. China might do this, if already
losing in a conventional conflict or expecting to lose, even if its own
cyber systems could be just as vulnerable to attack.103 [Countries
sometimes start wars or escalate]{.underline} not out of complete
confidence that they will succeed but [after concluding that the risks
of inaction outweigh those of even risky action]{.underline}.104 And [if
China conducted such a cyber operation, it might be the very type of
**non-nuclear strategic attack**]{.underline} that [the Trump
administration's Nuclear Posture Review envisions as a plausible basis
for possible American nuclear first use]{.underline}.105

### China Revisionism

#### China's [revisionist]{.underline}---Official statements prove. Prefer [official statements]{.underline} because empirics can be evaluated [multiple ways]{.underline}, only statements provide a [clear demonstration]{.underline} of resolve.

#### a. [Even if]{.underline} they aren't revisionist now, they're [hiding their true intentions]{.underline} until they have the capabilities to [challenge the US]{.underline}, plan gives them that [golden opportunity]{.underline}---that's a basic tenant of realism. 

**[b. To win China is not revisionist they have to explain every action
as defensive. Revisionism does not preclude defensive actions, but
defensive realism precludes any offensive actions.]{.underline}**

#### [**c.** Only a risk]{.underline} we get offense---if China is revisionist, deterrence is the [only option]{.underline} because they pocket concessions. But, even if they're defensive, deterrence [can't hurt]{.underline} because it sends a signal that they can't win.

#### They are committed to counter extended deterrence, it's a core of liberal order of alliances

A final complication stems from the asymmetric alliance relationships
that characterize the United States and China. During the Cold War, both
the United States and the Soviet Union had allies and commitments
outside their national territories. Consequently, there were at least
some parallels in terms of understanding extended deterrence. In the
case of China, however, Beijing does not have any real allies that it is
clearly and credibly committed to defending. (Although China and North
Korea are, at least on paper, linked by their 1961 Mutual Defense
Treaty, many observers doubt that this commitment is truly binding on
either side.) For Beijing, neither Pakistan nor North Korea, the closest
analogues, are really comparable to the U.S. relationship with Japan.

As a result, [China does not face the problem of extending deterrence;
it is defending itself but it is not attempting to defend
allie]{.underline}s. Indeed, [it would be more accurate to say that
[China is]{.mark} not [focused]{.mark} on engaging in extended
deterrence, but [on **countering extended
deterrence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Along its periphery, **[China does
not directly confront the United States; it is seeking to deter and
coerce]{.mark} U.S[. friends and allies]{.mark}. This creates**
**substantially different asymmetric concerns between China and the
United States.** Where Washington is engaged in extended deterrence in
support of allies, Beijing is concerned about direct deterrence---i.e.,
direct threats to China]{.underline}.

[[There are functioning channels]{.mark} of communication [between NATO
and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} meetings of the
NATO-Russia Council ([NRC]{.underline}) at ambassadorial level.
[[But]{.mark} these channels are of limited]{.underline} effectiveness.
[The intensity of NATO-Russia [contacts has been]{.mark} **drastically**
[reduced]{.mark}]{.underline} following Russia's actions against Ukraine
and NATO's subsequent April 2014 decision to suspend practical
cooperation with Russia. [[With increased]{.mark} military activities
and]{.underline} what each side perceives as pressure or
[[probing]{.mark} of its limits [and 'red lines']{.mark} by the
other,]{.underline} whether intended or not, [[the existing]{.mark}
communication [channels are inadequate]{.mark} and insufficient to
clarify concerns]{.underline} or deal with uncertainties, especially
during periods of increased tension. [The level of mutual understanding
between Russia and NATO is **low**]{.underline}, [and the deterrence
signalling]{.underline} of each side [can be misunderstood]{.underline}
by the other [side or dismissed by them as posturing.]{.underline}

[[NATO and Russia will have to]{.mark} navigate better a space filled
with]{.underline} substantial and [genuine disagreements, ballooning
mistrust regarding the other side's intentions, and continued
prioritisation of deterrence and strengthening of respective military
potentials.]{.underline}

[In navigating safely, the priority should thus be given to
"[deepen]{.mark}ing"]{.underline} and multiplying the current
[[channels]{.mark} of communication]{.underline} and making the best
possible use of the existing instruments such as the NRC or the
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and its
Structured Dialogue. None of the actions suggested below would breach
the 'red lines' constraining the conduct of the bilateral relationship,
as currently understood by NATO or Russia. They can be also pursued in
parallel with efforts to utilise better all other available instruments
such as the OSCE-wide and bilateral confidencebuilding measures and the
Open Skies Treaty. [[These proposals **may appear
trivial**]{.mark}]{.underline} or modest, [[but]{.mark} their
implementation]{.underline} **[[would mark an improvement]{.mark}
in]{.underline}** comparison with **[the current
situation,]{.underline}** [[moving Russia and NATO towards **more
stability and predictability**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Better quality of dialogue While respecting the existing limitations,
for example regarding NATO's de facto decision not to resume
working-group level NRC contacts, [**[the following measures could be
pursued]{.underline}**:]{.mark}

• [[Schedule regular meetings of the NRC at the level of
ambassadors]{.underline}]{.mark}

Between 2014 and 2018, [ten meetings of the NATO-Russia Council were
held]{.underline}. Three took place in both 2016 and 2017 and two in
2018.3 [Topics included]{.underline} the situation in and around
[Ukraine]{.underline} (featured as the fixed first point of the agenda);
[transparency]{.underline} and [risk reduction]{.underline} in the
context of military activities, other issues of concern including the
situation in [Afghanistan]{.underline}, aviation security in the
[Baltic]{.underline} region, **[hybrid challenges]{.underline}** or the
Intermediate-Range [Nuclear Forces Treaty]{.underline}.

While this may suggest increased efficiency of contacts, [the exact
timing and agenda has had to be laboriously negotiated each
time]{.underline} before the NRC met. [The **infrequent**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[adhoc character]{.underline}** [of the meetings
increases the risk of important concerns not being raised in a timely
way or of falling off the agenda]{.underline}. [It does not give enough
scope to prepare]{.underline} the meetings, [ensure proper follow-up, or
develop any positive dynamics]{.underline} between them.

**[[Setting]{.mark} a firm timetable]{.underline}** [with a specified
number of **[regular meetings]{.mark}**]{.underline} (either bimonthly
or quarterly, with additional emergency meetings scheduled as needed)
[[would provide **more consistency**]{.underline},]{.mark} [avoid
divisive deliberations]{.underline} on the timing, [[make the channel
less vulnerable]{.mark} to political storms [and allow more continuity
of work.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As Chairman, [the NATO Secretary General]{.underline} [could take a more
leading role in setting the agenda, with NATO's Deputy Secretary General
working with the Russian Permanent Rep]{.underline}resentation [to
develop the preparatory materials for the meetings.]{.underline}

The first NRC meeting in 2019 took place on 25th January, with the INF
Treaty crisis high on its agenda. While there was no progress on
resolving the crisis, the meeting illustrated the need to discuss issues
of mutual importance in a timely and efficient manner.

• Russia to ensure ambassadorial level representation at the NRC

Since January 2018, there has been no Russian ambassador to NATO.4 Such
a long gap without a senior Russian diplomat with a direct connection to
Moscow's decisionmaking circles hinders a constructive dialogue in the
NRC and seems to signal Russian disinterest in improving relations with
NATO. It may also hamper communication during any period of increased
tension.

Russia could immediately appoint a Permanent Representative to NATO to
signal the importance of maintaining relations and make sustained
engagement possible. Alternatively, Russia could assign one of the two
Russian ambassadors currently in Brussels (one responsible for bilateral
relations and one for the European Union) to take over responsibility
for the NATO portfolio, or appoint a Moscow-based ambassador to
participate in the NRC meetings. Even under the NATO limits on the
Russian delegation, Russia could also bring in more senior diplomats,
military and civilian experts to brief the NRC on topics of mutual
interest and to prepare its meetings. The participation of Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in the January 2019 NRC meeting was a
welcome development.

• [[Ensure that there are multiple]{.mark} channels of
[military-to-military comm]{.mark}unication]{.underline}

[More military-to-military contacts [would add]{.mark}]{.underline} to
the [[stability]{.underline}]{.mark} of the relationship by improving
understanding of the other, [[offering]{.mark} options on [channels to
be used in a crisis]{.mark} and [creating]{.mark}]{.underline} some
**[[trust]{.underline}]{.mark}** at a personal level. Dialogue and
technical contacts between the uniformed personnel of Russia and NATO
should not be a victim of lack of trust at the political level. [[So
far, there have been **sporadic**]{.mark} **telephone
[conversations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and direct meetings between the
Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces General Valery
Gerasimov and NATO's Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) General
Curtis Scaparrotti, as well as with previous Chairman of the NATO
Military Committee General Petr Pavel.

[The new Chairman of the [NATO]{.mark} Military]{.underline} Committee
Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach [[could **re-establish
com**]{.mark}**munication**]{.underline} [[with the Russian]{.mark}
Chief of the [General]{.mark} Staff]{.underline}, in parallel with the
existing SACEUR-Gerasimov channel. Based on a clear political mandate
with a clearly understood separation of functions, [these contacts could
be made **routine**]{.underline} and prepared at deputies' level. While
the SACEUR-Gerasimov [channel could focus on the most pressing military
activities, operations-related issues and current concerns]{.underline},
the Peach-Gerasimov exchanges [could focus on]{.underline} more
political and [longer-term questions related to military doctrines,
postures, development of capabilities and concepts of operations.
Improved]{.underline} and [multiple contacts [would serve as]{.mark}
another [instrument to]{.mark} clarify concerns]{.underline}, [[increase
transparency and build up]{.mark} mutual understanding and personal
[trust]{.mark}.]{.underline}

• [[Use]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[existing NATO-Russia hotline
in]{.mark} case of serious [cyber incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[NATO and Russia **lack**]{.mark} established [joint procedures to deal
with]{.mark} serious [cyber]{.mark}incidents and allegations of
cyber-attacks,]{.underline} despite the fact that these can have
disastrous consequences and despite the increase in the scale and
sophistication of cyber-attacks, sometimes attributed to states. [In
some cases]{.underline}, particular [NATO states and Russia would rather
use bilateral instruments to communicate and react]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} in case of a major or widespread attacks against
military targets, [it may be useful to have the possibility to interact
at the NATO-Russia level as well.]{.underline}

Due to the technical nature of any conversation about a potential
incident, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} [separate **[cyber incidents
hotline]{.mark}**]{.underline} [between NATO and Russia may be
preferable]{.underline}. Since this may not be feasible to set up,
[the]{.underline} [already existing NATO-Russia military-to-military
hotline should also be activated in the event of a
cyber-contingency]{.underline}. Both [NATO and Russia could agree that
they would be prepared to use the hotline for that purpose, and that
issue-experts would be available to advise the leadership of each side
in case of its activation. The]{.underline} use of the [Nuclear Risk
Reduction Centres]{.underline} in Washington and Moscow to [facilitate
inquiries about cybersecurity incidents could serve as a
blueprint.]{.underline}

While it would not solve the bigger problem of establishing rules and
norms in the cyberdomain, [the hotline [would]{.mark} help to **[control
the risk of escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in the event of
a]{.underline} serious [cyber-attack against a NATO member state or
Russia conducted by a third party]{.underline} or a non-state entity.
[It [could become **crucial**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in such cases [to
**prevent a false attribution**]{.mark}]{.underline} [of the attack
[and]{.mark} [retaliation]{.mark} against the wrong target.]{.underline}

More substance to dialogue Increasing the frequency of NATO-Russia
meetings or military-to-military contacts would have limited impact
unless the two sides look anew at the topics and potential of the
conversation. While not requiring any major policy changes, [these
recommendations would enable both sides to reflect on their goals for
NATO-Russia relations:]{.underline}

• **[NATO's homework]{.underline}**: [clarify the content of 'no
business as usual']{.underline}

[NATO Allies want to avoid any impression of getting back to what they
call "business as usual" with Moscow,]{.underline} in other words
[resuming cooperation with Russia while putting aside the current
disagreements, notably over Ukraine]{.underline}. Without a clearer
meaning of the term, however, any activity or topics beyond the current
agenda can be presented as crossing the line. [At the same time,
individual NATO states continue, to varying degrees, to pursue bilateral
contacts]{.underline} with Russia on topics of mutual interest. That may
with time create a gap between limited exchanges at the NATO-Russia
level and closer engagement at national level in some cases. [It may
therefore be in NATO's interest to review its approach to
dialogue]{.underline}. [The North Atlantic Council could
clarify]{.underline} through internal discussion [what NATO understands
by "no business as usual" and "no practical cooperation" with
Russia.]{.underline}

While clearly delineating areas of no engagement (for example, no
cooperation on sensitive issues like missile defence or joint
exercises), [that could open up space and give an impetus for **business
that needs to be done**]{.underline}. [This could include increased
political and military-to-military contacts, risk reduction measures,
arrangements for crisis prevention and management, and engagement in
confidence-building and arms control talks]{.underline} with Russia.

• Russia's homework: address the credibility gap in its dialogue offers
towards NATO

While Russia maintains that it makes attempts to pragmatically engage
the Alliance and its members, including on crisis management, and is
open to resumption of working-level contacts, it has a serious
credibility problem. Many Allies see Moscow as not engaging seriously on
some issues (such as specific questions on military exercises or
military build-up), cherry-picking topics or making proposals calculated
to divide the Alliance rather than to be constructive. NATO also
frequently claims that Russia's actions on the ground are inconsistent
with its engagement initiatives.

Russian decision-makers are certainly entitled to conclude that dialogue
with NATO is pointless. But if they are going to engage in dialogue at
all, and especially if they are interested in stabilising the
relationship with NATO and addressing the threat of escalation, they
will need to reflect on the effectiveness of their overall approach
towards NATO and its member states. A review could ensure that
diplomatic overtures are not unintentionally undermined by assertive
propaganda or military moves on the ground. Regarding specific topics,
Moscow could provide credible information on its military activities at
the NRC briefings and constructively address more of the questions
raised by the NATO side.

• Run a Table Top Exercise on the Management of Air Incidents

Significant steps have already been taken to reduce risks of collision
between military and civilian aircraft (for example, through the Baltic
Sea Project Team and the International Civil Aviation Organization), but
more should be done in the military-to-military sphere where dangerous
incidents continue to be an issue.5 While so far escalation has been
avoided, real-time management of an incident or accident involving the
air forces of NATO countries and Russia would prove to be challenging,
as the November 2015 Turkey-Russia incident demonstrated.

A table top exercise focused on air accident/ incident response could
develop a much needed procedural knowledge for handling such situations.
A non-governmental panel of experts could be convened from both sides
(including retired senior military with the requisite expertise, as well
as civil aviation experts) to scope the problem, run a table top
exercise with scenarios involving reacting to an air incident or
accident, and prepare recommendations. Such a panel could report to the
NRC, with results made available to the OSCE and other interested
organisations. This exercise could provide a blueprint for perfecting
procedures (such as the preparation of a code of conduct) that could be
discussed at the governmental level in order to improve the handling of
air incidents.

• [[Invite experts to brief the NRC on cyberspace]{.mark}
regulations]{.underline}

[The scope for advancing NATO-Russia discussion on crisis stability by
acting "from within" the NRC seems limited. This is particularly true
for the cyber domain,]{.underline} where the NRC conversation so far has
apparently been unproductive. [At the same time, the need for greater
regulation of cyberspace activities is growing more acute,]{.underline}
and a number of international initiatives have been launched to work on
solutions. [To move forward the discussions]{.underline} related to the
cyber domain within the NRC, [[it may be beneficial to draw on]{.mark}
the [experience of external experts]{.mark} such as members of the
United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on Developments in the
Field of Information and Telecommunications]{.underline} in the Context
of International Security6 [or the Global Commission on the Stability of
Cyberspace (GCSC]{.underline}).7

When it comes to air safety, the briefing by the Baltic Sea Project Team
helped the NRC to better comprehend the topic. Similarly, [[independent
cyberspace experts could brief the NRC]{.mark} on their work and
lessons-learned]{.underline}, [[making recommendations]{.mark} relevant
to the NRC which could be further discussed by the Council.]{.underline}

Intensifying NATO-Russia dialogue beyond the official government level
contacts

There are contacts between individual experts, think tanks and academic
experts from Russia and NATO countries, as well as sporadic joint
initiatives. Yet deterioration of the relationship has increased the
tendency to instrumentalise expert discussions as opportunities for
trading accusations rather than for engaging in a constructive dialogue.
This seems to consolidate rather than help to overcome the existing
diplomatic stalemate.

Non-governmental initiatives and those with the informal participation
of officials do not always require official blessing or implicate
governmental positions yet can provide valuable insights and suggestions
for intergovernmental work. They can operate at a more technical level,
outside the political limelight.

Initiatives to consider could include setting up a "Track 2 NATO-Russia
Council" of NGOs, think tanks and scientific organisations; establishing
a group of retired officials and experts to advise the officials on both
sides, or setting up a Wise Persons Study Panel to offer recommendations
on the future of the NATO-Russia relationship. Additionally, the NATO
Parliamentary Assembly's Bureau could maintain contacts with the Russian
Parliament in order to cultivate dialogue and explore the potential of
ad-hoc meetings.

Significant value-added can be derived from joint simulations (table top
exercises, war games or scenario-based discussions) involving experts,
former officials and retired military from NATO states, partners and
Russia. For example, simulations with the participation of retired
officials and officers could "test" responses to a developing crisis
between NATO and Russia, examine escalation scenarios and crisis
management procedures. Such exercises could help assess the dangers of
inadvertent escalation, the likelihood or otherwise of a rapid move to a
devastating conflict, and the adequacy of the current communication
arrangements. A potential post-INF Treaty escalation of tensions in
Europe caused by deployments of INF Treaty-class missiles could serve as
one possible scenario.

On another track, taking the Polish-Russian project "White Spots―Black
Spots: Difficult Matters in Polish-Russian Relations" as a point of
departure, a semi-official study of the history of NATO-Russian
relations could be initiated. The participation of historians from NATO
countries and Russia, with a broad access to archives, could help to
analyse the roots of some misunderstandings and myths about the past, or
at least illuminate better the conflicting narratives and historical
perspectives.

III Taking one step further in stabilising NATO-Russia relations

The limited character of the recommendations in the previous section
stems from a realistic assessment of what is feasible in the current
circumstances. NATO\'s and Russia\'s approaches to their relationship
are based on deeply-held views about the other side and their own
interests. It is difficult to see how the present confrontational
relationship can be significantly improved unless its trajectory is
changed by internal developments or external events.

The simplest but also least likely scenario for improvement would be a
major reconceptualisation of the relationship on either side. From
NATO\'s perspective, the change on Russia\'s side would most likely need
to include reversing the policy decisions of recent years including the
annexation of Crimea, restraint in its force deployments and exercises,
ceasing Russia\'s destabilisation campaign, accepting NATO as a partner
rather than a threat, reversing Moscow\'s negative stance on NATO\'s
enlargement and addressing the numerous issues brought up by the Allies.
From Russia's perspective, such a change would probably have to involve
NATO accepting Russia's recent territorial gains, significantly
restraining its military activities along its Eastern flank, and
accepting a halt on Eastern enlargement and limitations on partnerships
with countries bordering Russia. It is implausible to expect either side
to make such a dramatic U-turn.

[It may]{.underline} thus [be]{.underline} more [realistic to envisage
increased stabilisation of the relationship as stemming from a gradual
build-up of greater predictability between NATO and Russia.
Implementation of the recommendations]{.underline} from the previous
section [would be one step in that direction]{.underline}. Parallel
progress on resolving some of the contentious issues, such as the
implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the situation in the Azov Sea,
or the INF Treaty, would be another. A partial "détente" would mean a
slow, careful and reversible broadening of the areas of engagement,
dealing with some of the sharpest points of difference and avoidance of
new tensions.

If and when political space opens up that makes such increased
engagement possible, maintaining movement would require both sides to
respond step-by-step to the opportunity. That supports the case for
having 'in the air' ideas that have already to some extent been sifted.
These might range from additional channels of communication, potential
political pledges, declaratory measures, or crisis management
procedures, to initiating limited cooperation on issues of mutual
interest.

[Our exercise identified a short menu of]{.underline} ideas that did not
meet the requirement of immediate political feasibility but that were
nonetheless seen as **[practical and realistic]{.underline}** enough
[that they might become applicable]{.underline} at a certain point. [If
they were implemented, NATO-Russia relations would]{.underline} still be
adversarial but would **[be much more stable]{.underline}** and somewhat
less expensive.

Enhanced quality of dialogue [Assuming new willingness on both sides to
move beyond the current model of]{.underline} NATO-Russia dialogue, [the
following measures can be suggested:]{.underline}

• Convene a high-level NRC meeting to provide direction

Summit and ministerial-level contacts are not excluded by the April 2014
NATO Foreign Ministers decision on suspending practical cooperation with
Moscow.8 Many NATO Allies would currently see a ministerial level NRC as
a totally unacceptable 'reward' to Moscow. But in other circumstances
such a meeting could be reframed not as 'business as usual' but as
'business that needs to be done' to provide direction in reducing risk
in a continuing adversarial relationship. It might be convened, for
example, to address the 'rules of the road' for stability or even to
give momentum to a stabilisation and deescalation process.

• **[[Establish a dialogue on cyber activities within the
NRC]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[There are no commonly accepted rules guiding NATO-Russia conduct in
cyberspace]{.underline} and response towards hostile cyber activities.
[At the same time, there are several cyberrelated risks and challenges
relevant to the NATO-Russia relationship]{.underline}: the risk of
crossdomain escalation; the risk to command and control, communication,
and early warning systems; [the possibility of wrong or politicised
attribution]{.underline} of a cyber-attack; [the problem of third-party
attacks]{.underline} and the lack of deterrence rules in cyber space.
**[[A formal dialogue could serve transparency, confidence building and
risk reduction.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[NATO and Russia could establish an NRC Cybersecurity Working Group to
discuss possible risks]{.underline} involved in cyber activities and
ways to mitigate their escalation. [[This]{.mark} certainly falls into
the category of '**business that [needs to be
done]{.mark}'**.]{.underline} [This group could start by working on a
cyber-domain glossary of terms. Both [parties could]{.mark} also [work
on a prohibition of cyber-attacks on c]{.mark}ommand [and
c]{.mark}ontrol [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO and Russia
could also use the working group to provide some transparency regarding
their cyber policies and the mechanisms and criteria they will use to
assess alleged cyber-attacks.

In the event of any future updates of the Tallinn Manual, which aims to
identify rules for cyberspace activities, the facilitator -- the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence -- could potentially
invite Russian experts to participate, in order to broaden the range of
the exercise.

#### Cyber hotline solves

**[Banco 19]{.underline}** Erin Banco National Security Reporter. Kevin
Poulsen Sr. National Security Correspondent. Updated Mar. 07, 2019.
"U.S. intelligence officials are looking to Washington-Moscow hotline as
a last-ditch crisis channel that might just prevent a cataclysmic online
showdown."
<https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-hotline-could-keep-the-us-and-russia-from-cyber-war>
{DK}

As concerns mount that Russia will unleash hackers and online
disinformation brigades to wreak havoc in another American election,
senior U.S. officials are taking a second look at a technology handed
down from the age of Gorbachev and Reagan: an emergency
"[[hotline]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[between]{.mark}]{.underline}
officials in the [[U.S. and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[might]{.underline}]{.mark} someday [[pull both countries back from the
brink of an all out cyberwar.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The secure messaging system, known colloquially in the White House as
the "cyberhotline," already exists. It was set up in 2013---building off
a Cold War messaging system, in fact---in the hope that it might
facilitate conversations between the two countries during a crisis in
cyberspace, where the identities and intentions of attackers are often
muddled. So far it's been [[used]{.underline}]{.mark} only
[[once]{.underline}]{.mark}, in the waning days of the Obama
administration, when the White House's cyberchief fired off a [carefully
worded warning to Moscow not to attack the "infrastructure" for the 2016
election.]{.underline}

Since then, the U.S. has invested in developing a Cold War-style
deterrence capability in cyberspace, and military brass have publicly
touted their willingness to respond to foreign cyberaggression in kind.
But with that sharper stick comes greater risk of a misunderstanding
that might lead to an escalating conflict online. So intelligence
officials in the Trump administration are talking about using the
cyberhotline as a last-ditch crisis channel that might just prevent the
electronic equivalent of the Cuban Missile Crisis, according to three
U.S. officials.

"Everything has been laid out on the table, all sorts of options of
dealing with this cybersecurity threat. The hotline is something that
came up in the context of us needing to really face this issue head
on---and to know that Russia has received the message," said one senior
intelligence official. "It's the option we would use if we felt like all
the other options weren't working and if the crisis was escalating
quickly. We've seen no signs that Russia has stopped meddling.\"

There are ongoing concerns in the Department of Homeland Security and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Russia, among other countries,
is continuing to stir trouble in U.S. politics and is actively planning
to meddle in the 2020 presidential elections, according to three
individuals with first-hand knowledge of reports drawn up within the
last six months. (The FBI declined to comment for this story, and DHS
didn't respond to multiple written and telephone requests for comment.)

But while the Justice Department continues its prosecutions of Russian
intelligence officers for their roles in the 2016 election and the
military continues to prepare for a possible cyberwar, national security
policymakers are grappling with a pair of beyond-thorny questions: How
do we stave off another Russian attack on U.S. elections? And what do we
do to keep any attack from becoming a cataclysm? Warning Russia directly
through an official channel could provide at least some answers.

"I would expect to see some of that same Russian activity to occur
again. I think the [[hotline is a useful tool to raise
concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Michael Daniel, the former White
House cybersecurity adviser and president and CEO of the Cyber Threat
Alliance. "I am certain at some point the U.S. will use it again."

Daniel was there for the first and only time the hotline has been used
so far.

It was October 2016, not long before the voting for president was set to
begin. According to Daniel, the Obama White House decided to warn
President Vladimir Putin that it had gathered intelligence that
indicated Russia was attempting to disrupt the U.S. election.

\"We didn't have full knowledge and understanding of the scope of the
social media and disinformation work," Daniel said. "We were focused on
the threats to the actual infrastructure."

The decision to contact Russia through the established hotline included
a slew of top-level cabinet secretaries, including then-National
Security Adviser Susan Rice.

Discussions about when and how to contact Russia spanned weeks,
according to four former National Security Council staffers.

"There was a process at the staff level to approve the actual content to
make sure we were sending the right message," Daniel said, adding that
no one in the administration knew if or how Russia would respond to the
communication.

"The fact that we were using it to communicate our concerns about the
potential for Russia using cyber-means to disrupt the election," he
added. "We knew it would convey how serious we were about this issue."

The message, which was carefully crafted into an agreed template between
the U.S. and Russia, eventually made its way to staffers at the Nuclear
Risk Reduction Center (NRRC) at the State Department.

The U.S. and Russia created the center in 1987 as a way to establish a
direct line of communication in the event of looming nuclear war. More
than a quarter-century later, Washington and Moscow signed an agreement
to establish the [[cyber hotline]{.underline}]{.mark}---one tacked on to
the old NRRC messaging system and an additional voice line that would
[[extend between the U.S. Cybersecurity Coordinator]{.mark} in the White
House [and the Russian Deputy Secretary]{.mark} of the Security
Council]{.underline}.

"It was a big deal... just like in the cold war, the [[way you
handle]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear, and now [[cyber, is to ease
involuntary escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Chris Painter who
served as the top U.S. "cyber diplomat" at the State Department from
2011 to 2017.

Once the 2016 message left the NRRC system, Daniel and his team received
notice that it had been delivered to the Kremlin.

"And then, we waited," Daniel said, adding that everyone involved in the
crafting of the message went back to their daily routines.

"It took a couple of days," he said. "Then, we heard back. Their message
was, 'We need more information.' That was the last of the
communication."

Two other former National Security Council staffers said that a voice
hotline was also used to communicate with the Kremlin about election
meddling.

The cyberhotline idea came to fruition in 2013 amid growing concerns in
the U.S. administration that its relationship with Russia was on a crash
course.

"The hotline was [[a symbolic gesture that could be used to help build a
relationship with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} and in the event of a real
emergency, the administration and Moscow could... chat," said one former
State Department official.

The voice line, Painter said, "was something the Russians wanted...
**[[No matter how bad things get]{.underline}]{.mark}** between Russia
and the United States, **[[it is always
answered]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

[[A]{.mark} less well known but]{.underline} [**[growing
component]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [West's cyber
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, **[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}**
also **[[diplomatic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [in the form of cyberspace
security diplomacy. As exemplified by the]{.underline} U.S. **[[State
Department's]{.mark} Office]{.underline}** of the Coordinator for Cyber
Issues (CCI)5\] [this [work involves **engaging with foreign
counterparts**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to develop]{.underline}]{.mark}
and articulate **[[common understandings]{.mark} of]{.underline}**
peacetime norms for **[cyber activity]{.underline}**; this includes the
principles set forth by United Nations experts in 2013 that states
should not attack each other's civilian critical infrastructure in
peacetime.\[6\] [[It also involves promoting the **adoption of common
positions in attributing cyberattacks**]{.underline}]{.mark} to
malicious cyber actors [[and]{.underline} **[in imposing
penalties]{.underline}**]{.mark} (e.g., sanctions, public condemnation,
or prosecution) [upon those actors]{.underline}.

[[Cyberspace security diplomacy]{.mark} was responsible for a 2019
agreement reached by 28]{.underline} Western [countries]{.underline}
[expressing support for the "evolving framework of responsible state
behavior]{.underline} in cyberspace," [supporting "targeted
cybersecurity capacity building to [ensure]{.mark} that all responsible
[states can]{.mark} implement this framework and **[better protect their
networks from significant disruptive, destructive, or otherwise
destabilizing cyber activity]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,"]{.mark} and
pledging to "work together on a voluntary basis to hold states
accountable when they act contrary to this framework."\[7\] It is now
not unusual for US officials to impose sanctions upon malicious cyber
actors in other countries, nor for US law enforcement agencies to issue
criminal indictments.\[8\] Work by US diplomats, intelligence officials,
and law enforcement officers to engage their international counterparts,
moreover, has helped encourage foreign governments impose concrete
international steps to penalize such malefactors as well.\[9\]

In the US, [such cyber-diplomacy has been undertaken under the aegis of
the 2018 National Cyber Strategy, which called for "an international
Cyber Deterrence Initiative" that would include building "a coalition
\[of states\] and develop\[ing\] tailored strategies]{.underline} to
ensure adversaries understand the consequences of their own malicious
cyber behavior."

[[The United States will work]{.mark} with [like-minded states to
coordinate]{.mark} and support [each other's responses to]{.mark}
significant malicious [cyber incidents]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[including through intelligence sharing]{.underline}**,
[buttressing]{.underline}]{.mark} of [[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}
claims, public statements of support for responsive actions taken, and
joint imposition of consequences against malign actors.\[10\]

[[Such **diplomacy**]{.underline}]{.mark} cannot solve all today's
problems of rampant cybercrime and state-sponsored cyber assaults, of
course, but it [[is]{.mark} a [key piece of the puzzle]{.mark} as
Western societies build effective responses.]{.underline}

[Cyber diplomacy involves convincing others to agree upon cyber threat
assessments, the attribution of specific attacks to specific actors, and
what sorts of response may be appropriate]{.underline} in any given
case. While there are extremely technical aspects of this work (such as
the analysis of cyber-attackers' TTPs and intelligence-derived
information in connection with attribution assessments) cyber diplomacy
is not only a technical matter but also a persuasive and even political
exercise, in which international counterparts work to develop areas of

The Diplomacy of International Cyber-Collaboration

[[Cyberspace security diplomacy revolves heavily around international
efforts to come to agreement on]{.mark} cyber [threats -- and on the
attribution]{.mark} of a cyber-attack to a particular malicious cyber
actor.]{.underline} "[[Attribution diplomacy" is **critical to the State
Department's cyberspace security engagements**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Though the conventional wisdom used to hold that such attribution was
all but impossible in cyberspace,

... \[i\]t actually is possible to do more by way of attribution than
most observers once thought possible. It is sometimes even possible to
share enough information with one's friends and partners that they, too,
can have a reasonable degree of confidence in the source of an
attack.\[11\]

Among today\'s great ironies is that, despite the fact that [[the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [has been **at
war**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} the better part of]{.underline}
**[two [decades]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [rare is the American policy
maker who **speaks adeptly**]{.underline} [about our
**use**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[military]{.underline}** [power
in a]{.underline} **[coherent manner]{.underline}**. On the one hand,
[political [leaders]{.mark} attempt to [avoid categorizing]{.mark} our
[air strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} and raids [targeting al-Qaeda and the
Islamic State in countries around the world [as war,
while]{.mark}]{.underline} on the other hand [[they
**conflate**]{.underline}]{.mark} [hostile [Russian acts with]{.mark}
some form of]{.underline} **[hyphenated [war]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This article argues that [the adoption of two prominent and fashionable
**theoretical [terms]{.mark}** and their various iterations-the **[gray
zone]{.mark}**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} [**grayzone**
conflict]{.underline} (usually described as the space between peace and
war) [[and]{.underline} **[hybrid war]{.underline}**]{.mark} (often
described as Russia\'s new form of mixed-methods warfare birthed by
General Valery Gerasimov)-[[is]{.mark} an example of an]{.underline}
**[American [failure]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to think clearly]{.mark}
about **political**, **military**, and **strategic** issues]{.underline}
and their vitally important connections.

[[These terms]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as the concepts arising from
them, [[should be **eliminated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [from
the]{.underline} [**strategic lexicon**. [They cause **more harm than
good**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} contribute to an
increasingly]{.underline} **[dangerous
[distortion]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[of]{.mark} the concepts of
[**war**, **peace**, and]{.mark} **geopolitical [competition]{.mark}**,
with a resultant **negative impact**]{.underline} [on the crafting
of]{.underline} **[security strategy]{.underline}** [for the **U**nited
**S**tates and]{.underline} its allies and partners around the world.

If an effort to eliminate two such commonly accepted terms and the
theoretical approaches arising from them seems a fruitless effort to
corral the contents of Pandora\'s box, then examine the most recent U.S.
National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy.1 You will not
find either term in these documents even though, as we will see, both
have appeared regularly in U.S. political and strategy documents for
years. This demonstrates that [[it is **possible** to discuss
**security**]{.mark} **challenges**]{.underline} [[without reliance
on]{.mark} **problematic [terms]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that **confuse
strategic issues**]{.underline}]{.mark} [rather than clarify
them]{.underline}. This is what we hope to achieve in this article.

There are four key problems with gray-zone conflict and hybrid war and
the related variations of each.

1\. They are examples of poorly constructed new theories that more often
than not cloud rather than clarify.

2\. They distort or ignore history, sometimes by claiming to be new when
we have seen similar confusion in the past.

3\. They feed a dangerous tendency to confuse war and peace.

4\. They undermine U.S. strategic thinking via the construction of
critical political and strategic documents on the basis of flawed ideas,
even sometimes resulting in strategic guidance derived from a focus on
tactical matters.

[After almost two decades of war, we should]{.underline} **[heed the
lessons]{.underline}** [that writers]{.underline} such as Emile Simpson
[learned firsthand in Afghanistan: \"What [liberal powers]{.mark} do
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[blurring]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} **[conceptual [boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[between war and peace]{.mark} is often to]{.underline}
[**[militarise]{.underline}** [in a polarised manner **pre-established
patterns**]{.underline}]{.mark} [of political activity, which might
otherwise not be part of the wider conflict]{.underline}.\"2 As we will
see, part of [the]{.underline} **[cure]{.underline}** [for a poor
understanding of some of our geopolitical problems is **not to confuse**
geopolitics, competition among adversaries]{.underline}, or ham-handed
influence efforts [with **war**]{.underline}. [The **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} (and its allies) [survived the Cold
War]{.underline} (what some have termed more accurately the Cold Peace)
[without confusing whether it was at war or at peace]{.underline} with
the Soviet Union-when such confusion could have produced nuclear
Armageddon. We need to relearn how to make this distinction.

A FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSIS

To support these claims, [we must]{.underline} do something of
fundamental importance: [establish the basis for our discussion. This
will give us a]{.underline} **[firm foundation]{.underline}** [for
analysis, because without a]{.underline} **[secure base]{.underline}**
[one **cannot evaluate** terms and concepts **consistently** and
**rationally**]{.underline}. [This is important because what some
advocates of hybrid and gray-zone ideas are doing is]{.underline}
**[elevating the importance]{.underline}** [of these concepts to being
a]{.underline} **[new /theory of war]{.underline}**. Proposing
supposedly new tools or methods for analysis is to present new theory.
How do we judge whether this theory is valid, rigorous, and testable?

Carl von Clausewitz gave us the first steps. \"The primary purpose of
any theory is to clarify concepts and ideas that have become, as it
were, confused and entangled\"3 Theory, as Sir Julian Corbett tells us,
\"can assist a capable man to acquire a broad outlook\" [[Theory should
teach us to **think critically**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [to
**[analyze]{.mark}**, to [bring a **questioning**]{.mark} **but
[informed]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[eye]{.mark} to the problem at hand,
[and]{.mark} to [consider]{.mark} both its]{.underline}
[**[depth]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[breadth]{.underline}**.
[It provides **conceptual tools**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **grounds
us**]{.underline} [[by defining]{.mark} our [terms]{.mark} and
[providing us a **firm foundation for analysis**,]{.mark} while teaching
us to **distinguish** between what is important and what is
not]{.underline}.4

The results of [theory]{.underline}, Clausewitz insists, \"must have
been derived from military history, or at least checked against it\"
thus ensuring \"that theory will have to remain realistic. It [cannot
allow itself to get lost in]{.underline} **[futile
speculation]{.underline}**, hairsplitting, and flights of fancy\" Most
importantly, particularly in any theory addressing warfare, it \"is
meant to educate the mind of the future commander\"5 Historian Peter
Paret has made similar points. \"A theory that is logically and
historically defensible, and that reflects present reality, has the
pedagogic function of helping the student organize and develop his ideas
on war, which he draws from experience, study, and from history-the
exploration of the past extends the reality that any one individual can
experience\"6

#### Bad strategic studies terminology turns the case.

[Commentators frequently use [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[gray
zone]{.underline}** [phrase]{.underline}]{.mark} [to describe
the]{.underline} **[war]{.underline}** [Vladimir Putin launched against
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014, [implying that the **actions** were
**opaque**]{.underline} [enough to]{.underline} **[[cloud
perceptions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [about whether war had
erupted]{.underline} in the Donbas[. Commentators also use gray zone and
its variations to describe China\'s moves]{.underline} to cement its
extralegal territorial claims in the South China Sea against weaker
opponents, as well as Iranian moves in Syria and the Persian Gulf.

[The **popularization** of the **term** gray zone appears to have been
**inspired** by its]{.underline} **[incorporation]{.underline}** [into
military]{.underline} **[documents]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[speeches]{.underline}**. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review
references challenges that occur in an \"ambiguous gray area that is
neither fully war nor fully peace.\"16 But it took the remarks delivered
five years later by General Joseph L. Votel, USA, the then head of
Special Operations Command, to bring the term into the public eye. He
incorporated the concept into his briefing to Congress on the unique
challenges posed by Russia and the Islamic State, noting that \"our
success in this environment will be determined by our ability to
adequately navigate conflicts that fall outside of the traditional
peace-or-war construct\"17

An article discussing \"a \'gray zone\' between traditional notions of
war and peace\" appeared soon after.18 More [publications quickly
followed]{.underline}; they seem to be an elaboration of General
Votel\'s remarks and to discuss conflicts \"that fall between the
traditional war and peace duality\"19 [Collectively, this work gave us a
generally]{.underline} **[accepted definition]{.underline}** [of the
term.]{.underline} Other publications arrived before the end of 2015.20
After these instances, [use of the term exploded]{.underline}.21 One
article arguing for a place between peace and war did appear in August
2014, but it does not mention a gray zone specifically.22 The earliest
example of this delineation (which does not appear to underpin the key
relevant literature) appeared in a 1995 international law article that
mentions \"the gray zone between war and peace\"23 Japan\'s 2010 and
2013 National Defense Program Guidelines took a slightly different tack,
pointing out that \"there are a growing number of so-called
\'gray-zone\' disputes-confrontations over territory, sovereignty, and
economic interests that do not escalate into wars\"24 There is also a
related October 2014 Stars and Stripes article.25

[[The key academic text]{.underline}]{.mark} seems to be [Michael J.
Mazarr\'s Mastering the Gray Zone]{.underline}, which [[does
**not**]{.mark} **provide [a sufficiently clear
definition]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the gray zone. [The best that can
be derived from it]{.underline} is that [a \"new standard form of
conflict\" is emerging from \"revisionist states\"]{.underline} that are
\"competing below the threshold of major war.\"26 Moreover, [gray-zone
war is defined in relation to an undefinable term:]{.underline} **[major
war]{.underline}**.27 A commonly accepted definition of this in certain
academic circles is as follows: \"[Major war means an operation where
the **U**nited **S**tates deployed **over fifty thousand
troops**]{.underline} [and there were at least]{.underline} **[one
thousand battle deaths]{.underline}**.\"28 [This definition
is]{.underline} **[arbitrary]{.underline}** [and means based, and
thus]{.underline} **[unusable]{.underline}**.

Mazarr derived the term-at least in part-from the work of the special
operations community.29 But our inquiries have failed to determine any
inspiration for other recent American users of the term. It could derive
from a 2005 book by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, American and
Italian Marxist scholars, respectively (Negri is a devotee and former
student of Michel Foucault). Hardt and Negri related the gray-zone
concept to the post-Saddam Iraqi insurgency and wrote that \"most of the
current military engagements of the United States are unconventional
conflicts or low-intensity conflicts that fall in the gray zone between
peace and war\"30 Ironically, here gray zone is used by critics of
America to describe what is seen as deliberate efforts to blur
recognition of what is clearly a military action: the occupation of a
sovereign nation. Even more ironically, Russian officials frequently
depict hybrid war as something \"the Americans do\" with \"their
advocacy of color revolutions\"-which demonstrates the crossover
contagion effects of the use of both terms.31

GRAY-ZONE CONFLICT AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEORY

[[There are]{.mark} several **[fundamental
problems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with use of the term gray
zone.]{.underline}32 The [first has to do with **theoretical
considerations**]{.underline}. [Again, the [advocates]{.mark} of the
concept-**[whether or not they realize]{.mark} it**, and whether
[or]{.mark} not they [insist they are]{.mark} doing so-are]{.underline}
[**[creating new theory]{.underline}** [about what is and is not
war]{.underline}]{.mark}.33 The [advocates of the gray-zone conflict
terminology **fail this test**]{.underline} [because]{.underline}, as we
will see, [they are]{.underline} **[not clarifying
concepts]{.underline}** [but instead]{.underline} **[creating
confusion]{.underline}**.

As with some discussions of hybrid war, [gray-zone publications
**haphazardly**]{.underline} [swirl and mingle the levels of
war]{.underline}. Mazarr mixes strategy and tactics when he calls
Chinese actions in the South China Sea the \"use of gradual,
multi-instrument strategies\" then in the next sentence states that
Russia\'s moves against Ukraine \"also constitute a variety of the
tactic\" and in the next sentence avers that Iran\'s search for regional
power and nuclear weapons is \"a variety of gray zone strategy\" He also
writes that \"gray zone conflict involves the holistic application of a
mosaic of civilization and military tools, short of combat operations,
to achieve gradual progress toward political objectives.\" Here, as in
other places, the author is partly writing about grand strategy, because
he is examining the various tools of power a nation can employ in
pursuit of its political objective.34

[All [this produces]{.mark} a]{.underline} [**[critical
problem]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [**logic**. If you do not
define]{.underline}]{.mark} [your [terms and stick to]{.mark} a [valid
use]{.mark}]{.underline} of them, [[you have **not presented**]{.mark}
**a [basis for rational discussion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Failing to
differentiate among **grand strategy**]{.underline},
**[strategy]{.underline}**, **[operations]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[tactics]{.underline}** [compounds
this]{.underline}]{.mark} [problem]{.underline}. A challenge on the
tactical level must be addressed in ways starkly different from those
applicable to a strategic threat.

Mazarr also argues that revisionist powers \"are creating a new approach
to the pursuit of aggressive aims, a new standard form of conflict\" by
undermining foes gradually on their periphery.35 The reality is that
there is nothing new here. The Nazis used subversion to undermine
Austria and Czechoslovakia before World War II. This was a standard
Soviet practice against NATO countries. Mazarr himself writes that the
ancient Greeks behaved in the manner now associated with gray-zone
conflict. Revisionist or aggressive powers certainly are a problem
today, but they always have been a problem and always will be.

[None of this]{.underline}, of course, [counters]{.underline} the fact
that Mazarr and others indeed are correct about [the danger from
revisionist states. But we must **parse the problem**]{.underline} [in
a]{.underline} **[clearer manner]{.underline}** [to develop]{.underline}
**[proper responses]{.underline}**. [[If one identifies]{.mark} the
[problem incorrectly, one]{.mark} very likely [will **deliver the wrong
answer**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most important and useful part of
Mazarr\'s text provides superb analysis of the threat to the
international order from several aggressive, revisionist powers. The
challenges from China and Russia today resemble those of the 1950s. Both
the Soviet empire and China had, on their respective borders, weak
states that were not tied to any alliance system. Both also had
revolutionary, and thus revisionist, regimes, as does Iran. Today,
Russia, China, and Iran all have weak, often unaffiliated states on
their borders, or ungoverned or disputed areas, such as parts of the
South China Sea. The methods one uses to go about obtaining control of
these areas fall under the realms of grand strategy, strategy,
operations, and tactics. It is also here where the ideas of the original
gray-zone writers, as we will see shortly, are very applicable.

[The [gray zone]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Adam Elkus observes,
[[is]{.mark} \"just [another example of]{.mark} the **[strategic studies
community]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[needlessly **confusing
itself**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by generating **new
terminology**]{.underline} [to replace what is not
broken]{.underline}\"36
