In his first days in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has worked to
signal a clean break with his predecessor. He rejoined the Paris climate
accord, offered to extend the New START nuclear weapons treaty, and
reversed the "Mexico City" policy curtailing overseas abortion access.
His appointees have repeatedly emphasized that the administration will
prioritize diplomacy and multilateralism over former President Donald
Trump's "America first" nationalism.

But the fate of a central plank of Trump's foreign policy remains
uncertain: the focus on great-power competition, which according to his
administration's National Security Strategy has "returned." In a major
address at the U.S. State Department, Biden underscored his intention to
"work with Beijing when it's in America's interests to do so," but days
later noted the likelihood of "extreme competition" with China. This
rhetoric may reflect either pragmatism or that great-power competition
is on its way to assuming a dominant place in Biden administration
policy. [Even if Biden aims to de-emphasize competition in certain
areas]{.underline}, though, Republicans are certain to criticize the
administration for being weak and ineffective in the face of
international challenges. Absent some major change in the global threat
environment, [great-power competition will remain a focal point in
debates]{.underline} over U.S. foreign and national security policy.

[This is unfortunate]{.underline}. For all the concept's influence in
recent years, [**[g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower [c]{.mark}ompetition**
[is **not**]{.mark} a **[coherent]{.mark}** framework]{.underline} for
U.S. foreign policy. [Treating it as a guiding principle of American
grand strategy risks **[confusing means and ends]{.mark}**, [**wasting
limited resources** on **illusory threats**]{.mark}, [and **undermining
coop**]{.mark}**eration** [on **immediate security challenges**]{.mark},
such as **climate change** and **nuclear
nonprolif**eration]{.underline}. In the long run, [a [**fixation** on
**g**]{.mark}**reat-[p]{.mark}ower [c]{.mark}ompetition** is [likely to
**undermine, rather than enhance**]{.mark}, U.S. **[power]{.mark} and
influence**]{.underline}.

THE PROBLEM WITH COMPETITION

According to the Trump administration's 2018 National Defense Strategy,
"Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary
concern in U.S. national security." Just a year later, the analyst Uri
Friedman observed in The Atlantic that great-power competition was now
"invoked from Aspen to Israel to South Korea, and by U.S. officials
making the case for all sorts of policies." The phrase, he noted, "has
even achieved hallowed acronym status" in the form of "GPC." Some in
Washington see it as a sequel to the original Cold War, with China
taking over for the Soviet Union. Others look to more traditional
geopolitical rivalries as a model.

Great-power competition's newfound popularity reflects real facts on the
ground. Indeed, [competition among great powers cannot return, because
it never really went away]{.underline}. Rivalries between leading states
exist in every international system. Even during the 1990s---the height
of the "unipolar moment"---the United States and Russia competed in the
Balkans; the United States and France competed in parts of Africa; and
multiple states competed for influence in Central Asia.

But with Washington's unipolar status now on the wane, powers such as
China and Russia find it easier than they once did to challenge U.S.
leadership. Since states tend to consider overt antagonism a more
attractive option when they expect to come out on top, there will
inevitably be more competition among great powers as U.S. relative power
declines. With Washington on the back foot, foreign leaders see a chance
to gain economically, advance their security interests, and challenge
existing norms, rules, or their position in the international pecking
order.

[It is one thing]{.underline}, though, for Washington [to observe
increasing competition among great powers and adjust to a world in which
it enjoys less influence than it once did. It is another entirely to
elevate competition itself to the guiding paradigm of U.S. foreign
policy---as]{.underline} the Trump administration proposed and [Biden
may wind up doing]{.underline}. [[The **mere fact** of a]{.mark} more
**[competitive]{.mark} international [environment]{.mark}** [does **not
compel**]{.mark} states to engage in **[unrelenting struggle]{.mark}**.
[Instead]{.mark}, periods of **intense interstate rivalry** [happen
when]{.mark} great powers **[choose]{.mark}**---sometimes as a matter of
grand strategy, other times [through]{.mark} the **[accretion of
individual tactical decisions]{.mark}**---[to **prioritize conflict over
coop**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. **[[Nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
for instance, [[requires]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[to **push back** against **every peripheral
challenge**]{.mark} to its influence, status, or policy preferences.
[**Not every move** by **Moscow** or **Beijing** **constitutes
a**]{.mark} **direct [threat]{.mark}** to Washington's national
interests]{.underline}.

[It is also [**misguided** to think]{.mark}]{.underline}, as some have
suggested, [that **[g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower [c]{.mark}ompetition**
[makes]{.mark} norms, [**rules**, and]{.mark} other aspects of
**international [order]{.mark}** (**[liberal or otherwise]{.mark}**)
**[irrelevant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even during the Cold War, the
United States and the Soviet Union worked out a variety of formal and
informal rules that helped them manage competition, limit nuclear
proliferation, and otherwise structure international relations. Breaking
those rules meant real reputational costs, as the number of covert
interventions during the Cold War attests. Both sides of the conflict
faced stiff resistance when they violated norms of sovereignty or
national self-determination.

These norms, rules, and institutions often complement power politics.
They serve as both objects and instruments of great-power contestation.
In the nineteenth century, for instance, the German statesman Otto von
Bismarck appealed to shared norms in a successful effort to reduce
European resistance to German unification. Today, the United States
draws much of its relative power from institutional
arrangements---notably its unrivaled network of alliances and
partnerships---that frequently reflect and derive legitimacy from
liberal values.

These relationships underscore a central problem with treating
great-power competition as the organizing principle of foreign policy:
it provides very little in the way of guidance to policymakers. [[There
is **no single**]{.mark} **grand [strategy]{.mark}** for eras of
great-power competition. There are **[no instruments]{.mark}** of
statecraft **[that competition renders relevant]{.mark} or irrelevant**.
Great-power competition **[doesn't even imply]{.mark}** adopting a more
**[antagonistic approach]{.mark}** to rivals]{.underline}: as U.S.
President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev realized by
1987, [the best response to intensifying competition may be to dial
tensions back through confidence-building measures and
cooperation]{.underline}.

[Such **[indeterminacy]{.mark}** helps [explain]{.mark} the concept's
widespread [appeal]{.mark}: one **[can use g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower
[c]{.mark}ompetition [to justify]{.mark} almost
[anything]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the 1990s, the United States needed
enormous military budgets to prevent the emergence of new great-power
competitors. Now it needs them to compete with existing ones. Liberals
once called for major investments in infrastructure, education, and
research to sustain American primacy. Now they call for them to keep the
United States competitive in a multipolar world. Great-power competition
might require strategic retrenchment, or offshore balancing, or deep
engagement. [**Perhaps** it means that Washington must **give up its
liberal illusions** and pursue unbridled and **unilateral realpolitik**.
**Or maybe** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to
commit to **multilateralism** and more equitable relationships with
**allies**]{.underline}.

#### Their impact theorizations [overstate]{.underline} the [scope]{.underline} of competition -- it's [NOT all-encompassing]{.underline}, [revisionism is selective]{.underline} -- our [advantages]{.underline} have [greater explanatory power]{.underline} -- theirs [backfire]{.underline}

"America is back," blared headlines following President Joe Biden's
speech to the Munich Security Conference in February, an address clearly
designed to draw a line under the Donald Trump presidency and mark a new
start in trans-Atlantic relations. "We are not looking backward," Biden
promised. "We are looking forward, together." Yet one big plank of the
Trump administration's foreign policy is apparently sticking around:
great-power competition. "We must prepare together for a long-term
strategic competition," Biden told conference attendees, adding that
"competition with China is going to be stiff."

Unfortunately, [for all that **[g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower
[c]{.mark}ompetition** has been Washington's **favorite
buzzword**]{.underline} in recent years, [it remains frustratingly
**[poorly defined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, most [commentators
[skip]{.mark} right [past]{.mark} the big questions (Why are we
competing? **[Competing over what?]{.mark}**)]{.underline} [[and **go
straight to**]{.mark} arguing about **[how to achieve
victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the possible answers to these
questions range from the entirely reasonable (i.e., that Western states
should engage in collective defense of liberal democracy) to the
dangerous and utterly unrealistic (i.e., that Washington should be
pursuing regime collapse in Beijing), it's hardly something we should
ignore.

It seems that once again---[**[just as]{.mark}** it did during the
**[g]{.mark}lobal [w]{.mark}ar [o]{.mark}n [t]{.mark}errorism** in the
mid-2000s [or]{.mark} when styling the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as **[the indispensable nation]{.mark}** in the
1990s---Washington's strategic community is again reorienting itself
around [a new, **poorly theorized model**]{.mark} of the world and of
America's place in it]{.underline}. [Yet precisely because it
[is]{.mark} so ill-defined, **great-power competition as a
strategy**---that is to say, competition for its own sake---also has the
potential to be **highly dangerous**]{.underline}.

It is a mark of how recently the notion of great-power competition has
entered the Washington lexicon that someone who had fallen into a coma
just five years ago might never have heard the phrase. Though the Obama
administration's 2015 National Military Strategy warned of states
"attempting to revise key aspects of the international order," it was
not until the Trump era that the term itself entered widespread use.
Then-U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in June 2017 that a
"return to great-power competition ... places the international order
under assault," while the National Security Strategy released later that
year noted that "after being dismissed as a phenomenon of an earlier
century, great power competition returned." Since then, its growth has
been exponential.

[As a description, great-power competition is accurate; competition
among the great powers is a defining feature of the international
environment]{.underline}. Whether one is talking about 16th-century
rivalries among empires, the imperialist scramble for Africa, or the
Cold War struggle between the capitalist and communist blocs, states
have always jockeyed for power and influence. [But the notion that it is
**new**---or that it is **returning** as if history were taking its
revenge---is somewhat **[absurd]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the
Georgetown University professor Daniel Nexon recently put it,
"[competition among great powers cannot return, because it never really
went away]{.underline}."

[Instead, the "return of great-power competition" is essentially an
easier way of admitting that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is in relative decline]{.underline}. [The
**unipolar moment**]{.underline}---the three-decade period of U.S.
global predominance that started with the collapse of the Soviet
Union---[is **ending**]{.underline}. In the parlance of political
science, [other states are beginning to **balance against** the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. In layman's terms,
this means that with the United States in relative decline, other states
are increasingly willing to take actions they would not have during the
1990s, [whether it's **Russian intervention**]{.underline} in Syria,
[**Chinese** claims to the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}, or
European steps to circumvent U.S. sanctions legislation. Irving Kristol,
considered the godfather of neoconservatism, once noted that a
neoconservative is just a liberal who's been mugged by reality; some of
the loudest voices proclaiming an era of great-power competition are
just liberal internationalists who have been mugged by the reality of
power politics.

[Yet **if this were all there was to it**, the **debate** surrounding
great-power competition would be **far less problematic**. Scholars and
pundits would **update** their **mental models** for a **more
competitive world** and **move on** with their lives]{.underline}.
[**Instead**, foreign-policy circles]{.underline} in Washington [are
increasingly **fixated** on the notion that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**must commit to competition** with China, Russia,
and other states]{.underline}.

Great-power competition is portrayed less as a fact of life and more as
a strategy in and of itself. Certainly, some authors do suggest a
potential endpoint to great-power competition, such as Hal Brands and
Zack Cooper, whose recent piece in Foreign Policy argued that
competition between the United States and China would only lessen when
the regime in Beijing collapsed. [But they are **[still
unclear]{.mark}** on [**why** we should pursue an
**existential**]{.mark} Cold War-style **[struggle]{.mark}** with China,
[rather than]{.mark} a more measured approach of **[competitive
coexistence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This example is emblematic of the debate on great-power competition as a
whole. [As a grand strategy]{.underline}---what the Yale University
professor John Lewis Gaddis once described as "the calculated
relationship of means to large ends"---[**great-power competition** is
**sorely lacking**]{.underline}. For starters, it's [**not clear**
whether **competition** is itself a **means** or an
**end**]{.underline}.

The 2017 National Security Strategy, for example, describes the world as
an "arena of continuous competition" for which the United States must
prepare. Whether it is domestic infrastructure projects, student loan
forgiveness, repairs to democratic institutions, or increasing the birth
rate, a wide range of policy priorities are now portrayed as essential
to the pursuit of great-power competition. This suggests that
great-power competition is itself an end. Why the country is compelled
to compete in this way typically goes unstated.

Indeed, [[if]{.mark} great-power competition is instead [a
**means**]{.mark} to an end, it's **[not at all clear what]{.mark} those
[ends are]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There's [**rarely a concrete goal**
among those who proselytize]{.underline} in favor of a strategy of
great-power competition. Consider how the topic is portrayed by former
National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster in his recent book. He opens by
noting that "after the end of the Cold War, America and other free and
open societies forgot that they had to compete to keep their freedom,
security, and prosperity" while later arguing that states must "compete
thoroughly as the best means of avoiding confrontation."
[Confusingly]{.underline}, he [[portrays **competition** as **both** an
**alternative to conflict** and]{.mark} as [a **Manichean
struggle**]{.mark} **between good and evil**, with the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[beset by
adversaries]{.underline}** on all sides.

[It's easy to dismiss this kind of rhetoric as **silly**, but it also
carries **substantial danger**]{.underline}. For one thing, the [focus
on competition **[masks]{.mark} a whole series of underlying
[assumptions]{.mark}** about the international system and America's role
in it]{.underline}. Washington's policy community appears convinced that
we are headed for a more dangerous world, one in which the United States
must push back against the perceived aggression of states like China and
Russia. Though articles almost always include an obligatory aside---that
cooperation with China on climate change is a must!---the frame is
almost uniformly confrontational.

To be clear, there are good reasons for Washington's strategic community
to perceive an increasingly competitive world. The gap between the
United States and other countries is narrowing militarily; it has
already closed by some economic measures. And pushback against U.S.
foreign-policy choices among other states has increased in recent years,
from Chinese attempts to revise maritime rules to Russia's aggressive
targeting of foreign elections. [But a more competitive world **[isn't
the same thing as an all-out struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Great-power competition is often portrayed as an **all-or-nothing
conflict**, [where **revisionist autocracies** are **challenging** the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[in
every sphere]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[In
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus far [[**China** and **Russia** are
**only selectively revisionist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, attempting to
change the status quo where it suits their interests and to maintain it
in other places.

[The [**risks** of the **all-or-nothing approach**]{.mark} to global
politics **[cannot be overstated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Fareed
Zakaria put it recently, "The United States [risks **squandering the
hard-won gains from four decades of engagement** with
China]{.underline}, encouraging Beijing to adopt confrontational
policies of its own, [and leading the world's two largest economies into
a treacherous conflict of unknown scale and scope]{.underline}." Indeed,
[if one assumes---as]{.underline} much of the [writing on great-power
competition does---that China and Russia are implacable foes of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [determined to destroy the
existing order and overturn U.S. hegemony, then policies that would
otherwise be unthinkable are suddenly on the table]{.underline}.

[[**Military buildup** in **Europe** and **Asia** becomes necessary,
even if it **raises**]{.mark} **the [risk of open conflict with another
nuclear power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Economic decoupling** seems
vital to protect supply chains, though studies show that the
**costs**]{.underline} to U.S. companies and workers [would be
**extreme**]{.underline}. A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's China Center, for example, estimated that the U.S. economy
could lose up to \$1 trillion in growth if tariffs were more broadly
applied to all U.S.-China trade. Restrictions on tourism or on Chinese
students studying in the United States would cost between \$15 billion
and \$30 billion per year.

[The bottom line is simple: It's easy to make fun of great-power
competition as a **meaningless buzzword** or as Washington's
foreign-policy elite rediscovering that other states get to have a say
in world politics. But]{.underline} as the political scientist Robert
Kagan wrote recently, the biggest question of the coming decades may be
whether countries can "confine the global competition to the economic
and political realms and thus spare themselves and the world from the
horrors of the next great war or even the still frightening
confrontations of another cold war." In that context, the blind pursuit
of a strategy of great-power competition is irresponsible and
shortsighted.

The [last time the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**single-mindedly pursued a poorly thought-out slogan masquerading as a
strategy**, it ended up fighting a two-decade global war on terrorism, a
conflict from which it is still struggling to extricate itself and that
had **immense negative effects** on]{.underline} the country's [foreign
relations]{.underline} and its domestic liberties. [Yet if today's
leaders are not careful, the **rhetoric of great-power competition**
could **drag the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**into
a conflict** even more costly and damaging]{.underline}.

The Indispensable Nation

Although geopolitical fear prevents current international empirical
realities from receiving a fair evaluation by U.S. society, another
belief prescribes a specific approach to foreign policy, one that
mandates a far higher level of international activism than would
otherwise be warranted. Both are based on thin intellectual foundations,
and together they encourage a variety of ill‐​advised policies on the
part of the United States. According to what might be considered the
indispensability fallacy, [many Americans believe]{.underline} that
[U.S. actions are primarily responsible for any stability that currently
exists]{.underline}. "All that stands between civility and genocide,
order and mayhem," explain Lawrence Kaplan and William Kristol, "is
American power."37 That [belief is an offshoot]{.underline}, witting or
not, [of]{.underline} what is known as "[hegemonic stability
theory]{.underline}," which proposes that international peace is
possible only when one country is strong enough to make and enforce a
set of rules.38 Were U.S. leaders to abdicate their responsibilities,
that reasoning goes, unchecked conflicts would at the very least bring
humanitarian disaster and would quite quickly threaten core U.S.
interests.39

[Brzezinski is typical in his [belief that]{.mark} "outright chaos" and
a string of specific horrors could be expected to follow a loss of
hegemony, from [renewed attempts to build regional empires]{.mark} (by
China, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil) to the collapse of the U.S.
relationship with Mexico]{.underline} as emboldened nationalists south
of the border reassert 150‐​year‐​old territorial claims. Overall,
[[without U.S. dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}, today's [relatively
peaceful world would turn "violent and bloodthirsty]{.underline}."40 The
[[liberal]{.mark} world [order]{.mark}]{.underline} that is so
beneficial to all [[would come tumbling down]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Like many believers, proponents of hegemonic stability theory base their
view on faith alone.41 [[There is]{.mark} precious **[little
evidence]{.mark}** to suggest [that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is **responsible** for]{.mark} the **[pacific trends]{.mark}** that
have swept across the system]{.underline}. In fact, the [[world
remained]{.mark} equally [peaceful]{.mark}]{.underline}, relatively
speaking, [[while]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cut]{.mark} its [forces]{.mark}
throughout the 19**90s**]{.underline}, [[as well as while it
doubled]{.mark} its military [spending]{.mark}]{.underline} in the first
decade of the new century.42 [Complex statistical methods should **not**
be **needed** to demonstrate]{.underline} that [levels of U.S. military
spending have been essentially **unrelated** to **global
stability**]{.underline}.

[Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go way beyond]{.underline} the
[absence of simple correlations]{.underline} to support them, however.
The [theory's supporters have never been able to explain adequately how
precisely 5 percent of the world's population could force peace on the
other 95 percent]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world
was simply not intent on fighting. Most [[states are]{.mark} quite
**[free to go to war]{.mark}** without U.S. involvement [but **choose
not to**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially after Iraq, to
**steer** well **clear** of **most civil wars** and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal violence
in, say, [most of Africa would be unlikely to attract serious attention
of the world's policeman, much less intervention]{.underline}. The
continent is, nevertheless, more peaceful today than at any other time
in its history, something for which U.S. hegemony cannot take credit.43
[[Stability **exists**]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[in **many**]{.mark}
**such [places]{.mark}** to [which **U.S. hegemony**]{.mark} simply
**[does not extend]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Overall, proponents of the stabilizing power of U.S. hegemony should
keep in mind one of the most basic observations from cognitive
psychology: rarely are our actions as important to others' calculations
as we perceive them to be.44 The so‐​called [[egocentric
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is essentially ubiquitous in human
interaction, [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [although it may be
natural for **U.S. policymakers** to interpret their role as crucial in
the maintenance of world peace, [they are]{.mark} almost **certainly
[overestimating]{.mark}** their [own **importance**. Washington
is]{.mark} probably [**not as central** to]{.mark} the **myriad
[decisions]{.mark}** [in **foreign capitals**]{.mark} that help maintain
international stability [as it **thinks it is**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The indispensability fallacy owes its existence to a couple of factors.
First, although all people like to bask in the reflected glory of their
country's (or culture's) unique, nonpareil stature, [Americans have long
been exceptional in their exceptionalism]{.underline}.45 The short
history of the United States, which can easily be read as an almost
uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, has led to a
(perhaps natural) belief that it is morally, culturally, and politically
superior to other, lesser countries. It is no coincidence that the
exceptional state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and
justice in the world.

Americans have always combined that feeling of divine providence with a
sense of mission to spread their ideals around the world and battle evil
wherever it lurks. It is that sense of destiny, of being the object of
history's call, that most obviously separates the United States from
other countries. Only an American president would claim that by entering
World War I, "America had the infinite privilege of fulfilling her
destiny and saving the world."46

Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no other
seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in quite
the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants everybody to
be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I believe. And
that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine Albright called
the United States the "indispensable nation," she was reflecting a
traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48 Exceptional
nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to assist the
merely average.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And [unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [comes a
sense of great responsibility]{.underline}: to serve and protect
humanity, to drive history in positive directions. More than any other
single factor, the [people of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [tend to **believe** that they are
**indispensable** because they are **powerful**, and [power tends to
\[**obfuscate**]{.mark}\]]{.underline} ~~blind~~ [[states to]{.mark}
their **[limitations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 [It is **quite likely** that the [world does **not
need**]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to **enforce
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact[, [if]{.mark} virtually [any of
the **overlapping** and]{.mark} **mutually [reinforcing
explanations]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the [**current stability** are
correct]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[trends in]{.mark} international
[security]{.mark} may well [prove **difficult to reverse**]{.mark}. None
of the **contributing factors** that are commonly suggested]{.underline}
([**[economic development]{.mark}**, complex [**interdependence**,
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**, international
[**institutions**, **democracy**]{.mark}, **[shifting]{.mark} global
[norms]{.mark}** [on war]{.mark}) seem poised to disappear any time
soon]{.underline}.50 The [world [will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably
[**[continue]{.mark} its peaceful ways** for the near
future]{.underline}, at the very least, [no matter what the United
States chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded
while [pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made

### AT: Alliances !

#### [No war]{.underline} from [abandonment]{.underline} nor [entanglement]{.underline}

If [[**reputational credibility** has been]{.underline}]{.mark} so
[[**repeatedly debunked**, **both** in **specific instances** and as a
**theory**]{.underline}]{.mark}, why does it continue to loom so large
in America\'s foreign policy discourse?

Tufts University\'s Michael Beckley hinted at one possible explanation
in a much-discussed article last year in International Security: Could
it have something to do with America\'s uniquely broad network of
alliances?

Beckley\'s article was actually asking a different question ---
**[[whether]{.underline}]{.mark}** those [**[alliances lead]{.mark} the
US [to war]{.mark}**[, by]{.mark} allowing allies to \"entangle\" it in
foreign conflict]{.underline}. (Beckley concludes the answer is no;
other scholars have disputed his findings.)

But, in reviewing [so-called \"**[entanglement]{.mark}
theory**,\"]{.underline} Beckley points out that reputational
credibility, even if it doesn\'t exist in the world, is something that
definitely exists in the minds of foreign leaders
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign policy decision-makers.

\"The alliance comes to be perceived as an end in itself, transcending
the more concrete national security interests for which it was initially
conceived,\" political scientist Jack Levy wrote in a well-known 1981
paper (which Beckley cites). Here\'s the key quote:

[Political decision makers come to **believe that support for one\'s
allies**, regardless of its consequences, is **essential** for their
national prestige, and [that]{.mark} the [**failure to provide support**
would]{.mark} ultimately [result in]{.mark} their diplomatic
[**isolation** in a **hostile**]{.mark} **and threatening
[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So it\'s not that reputation is a real thing that compels states to act
in a certain way, but rather that individual decision-makers are driven
by their own mistaken belief in reputation. As a result, Beckley writes,
\"reputational concerns can drive states into wars over trivial
interests in peripheral places.\"

Some **[scholars]{.underline}**, including Levy, [argue that America\'s
**allies promote the idea of reputation, as a means to convince the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**to commit more
resources** to serve their own interests]{.underline}.

Foreign leaders do seem to become awfully preoccupied with American
credibility when they want the US to take military action on their
behalf. When the US failed to bomb Syria in 2013, for example, Syria\'s
enemies in the region --- Arab leaders who are also allied with the US
--- declared that American credibility was at stake.

\"I think I believe in American power more than Obama does,\" Jordan\'s
King Abdullah II said of Obama\'s decision to not bomb Syria.

This comes at a time when the US has grown unusually indulgent of its
allies, as Jeremy Shapiro and Richard Sokolsky argue in a recent
article. This has made American policymakers more likely to heed
allies\' demands and take their claims at face value.

But [Dartmouth\'s Jennifer Lind finds [**evidence** that **allies make
this argument only opportunistically**]{.mark}, and almost always about
conflicts in which they are directly involved. They [might
**speak**]{.mark} **in [the language of reputation theory]{.mark}**[,
but]{.mark} their [**behavior** suggests]{.mark} that [they **do
not**]{.mark} **really [believe]{.mark} in [it]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Reputation **[theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, after all, [[says]{.mark}
that America\'s **[allies would want the US to intervene as much as
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline} in other conflicts, [when [**in fact**
the **opposite is**]{.mark} **usually [true]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There are many good reasons to host such a gathering. It's smart
politics, fulfills a campaign commitment and counters the perception,
fostered by President Donald Trump, that America is no longer interested
in promoting democracy and human rights. But as a geopolitical
instrument, [**drawing lines between democracies and autocracies** is
not only **certain to disappoint** --- it's also a deeply flawed
organizing principle for America's approach to the world]{.underline}.

China and Russia, which Biden has also singled out for criticism, are
not the main causes of the weakening of democracies around the world.
Most of the backsliding, according to a recent study, has been caused by
erosion within the world's democracies, including the United States and
many of its allies. Indeed, the upcoming summit includes a number of
countries --- India, Brazil, the Philippines and Poland among them ---
marked by growing autocratic movements and infringements on freedom of
expression and a free press. And **[[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these and [**[other countries to reform]{.mark}** their political,
electoral or judicial institutions [**from the outside** is]{.mark} hard
if not **[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Biden isn't the first and won't be the last American president to make
democracy promotion central to his foreign policy. Woodrow Wilson wanted
to make the world "safe for democracy"; Franklin Roosevelt promulgated
the Atlantic Charter. The Clinton administration was present at the
creation of the Community of Democracies. George W. Bush had his Freedom
Agenda and talked about ridding the world of dictators. All found
democracy promotion a useful tool to advance U.S. values and interests.

Biden seems to genuinely believe that democrats and dictators are in a
do-or-die battle over who will own the 21st century. Though he insists
that he doesn't want a new cold war, some of his overcharged rhetoric
belies this view. In March, Biden announced his intention "to invite an
alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future," including
holding "China accountable to follow the rules" on issues such as
persecution of its Uyghur citizens and its territorial disputes with
Taiwan. Biden has said of China's President Xi Jinping that he "doesn't
have a democratic bone . . . in his body" and that Xi believes
"democracy cannot keep up with" China.

It is simplistic to believe, however, that Chinese and Russian foreign
policies are driven by the ideological impulse to spread autocracy. Both
countries see the United States as their main geopolitical adversary and
seek to undermine American influence and alliances wherever they can;
the Chinese are also bent on outcompeting the United States in
21st-century technologies.

But the Russians don't have an authoritarian model for export, and other
autocratic-minded governments don't need inspiration from Moscow to run
kleptocratic, corrupt, repressive and misgoverned regimes. Putin's
overriding priority is self-preservation and the preservation of his
regime. What evidence is there that he believes these objectives can be
achieved only if the rest of the world looks like Russia?

Likewise, Xi's main priority is maintaining his control and the Chinese
Communist Party's monopoly on power. He is all too happy to claim that
the Chinese government is outperforming America's dysfunctional system.
But it is simply not the case that he thinks these goals require Beijing
to actively spread authoritarianism with Chinese characteristics abroad.
And China's wealth and power, not to mention its social stability,
depend on competing effectively within the interdependent global
economic system, not toppling it.

[[Another **flaw**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Biden administration's
approach [[is the **presumption that all democracies think
alike**]{.mark} based on their shared commitment to democratic
values]{.underline}. If only it were that simple. [Values do shape a
nation's foreign policy, but history, geography, culture, political
ideology and material interests also matter]{.underline}. [It is
[**precisely for these reasons** that]{.mark} America's **[democratic
allies]{.mark}** and partners **[do not see eye to eye]{.mark}** on how
to deal with China or Russia --- and why they shouldn't be forced to
choose sides between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
the authoritarians]{.underline}.

**Doorenspleet '19** \[Renske; 2019; Political Science and International
Studies Professor at Warwick University; Rethinking the Value of
Democracy: A Comparative Perspective, "Democracy and Interstate War,"
Ch. 3\]

This finding or 'law' has not only been recognized by scholars of
international relations, but also found its way outside academia and has
influenced foreign policies to promote peace and democracy, most
prominently since the 1990s. However, [my book will not]{.underline}
draw conclusions based on '**[cherry-pick]{.underline}**ing' of specific
studies showing how peaceful democracies are, but on a systematic
overview of studies in this field. Therefore, [this book relies on **my
own database** with **[hundreds of]{.mark} different
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are relevant for each chapter;
the articles had to engage directly with the chapter's main research
question. The next section will provide more detailed information around
the selection criteria. This overview includes both highly cited and
recent articles which were selected in a systematic way.

Based on analyses of statistical studies around this topic of democracy
and war, it will become clear that the overall statistical support for
the democratic peace hypothesis is not strong at all. In the rest of the
chapter, I will spell out four reasons why [democracy does **not cause
peace**]{.underline}, and why [the **empirical [support]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} the popular idea of [democratic [peace]{.mark} is
**quite [weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}: (1) most [studies do [no]{.mark}t
find a **strong [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between democracy
and interstate war [[at]{.mark} the **[dyadic
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [they show that there are
**other---more powerful---explanations** for war and peace, or even that
the impact of democracy is a **spurious one**]{.underline}, (2) [the
**theoretical foundation** of the democratic peace hypothesis is
**weak**, and the causal mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}, (3)
[democracies are **not necessarily more peaceful**]{.underline} in
general, [and the [evidence]{.mark} for the democratic peace hypothesis
[at the **monadic level** is inconclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}, and (4)
the process of democratization is dangerous and living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country.

In my view, [it is]{.underline} difficult---if not
**[impossible]{.underline}**---[to support the democratic peace
hypothesis]{.underline} without any reservations. The key caveats should
not be ignored and certainly deserve more attention before we can
confidently argue that democracies are more peaceful than other types of
political systems. Please notice that I can already reveal that the
assumed link between democracy and intrastate war is problematic as
well, but this topic will be at the core of the next chapter (Chapter
4).

Selection of Articles: Democracy and War

The instrumental value of democracy cannot convincingly be found in
democracy's expected bond with peace. I have come to this conclusion on
the basis of an analysis of statistical studies, which will be discussed
in the rest of this chapter. So how did I select the articles for my
database?4

For this chapter and Chapter 4, I selected the articles that focused on
war and democracy. Using the online database Web of Science (formerly
known as Web of Knowledge), [I identified]{.underline} a total of almost
**[[8000 articles]{.underline}]{.mark}** published in the sampled
journals until the end of 2015. I identifed them by entering 'democr\*'
in the basic search field; this asterisk (\*)-based 'wildcard' allows
searching for terms including 'democratic', 'democracy', and
'democratization' (in both British and American spellings)
simultaneously, in the title, abstract and/or the keywords. As a next
step, I excluded articles in which 'democracy' is used as synonym for
state (e.g. analysis of the relationship between immigration policies
and unemployment in European democracies) or a specific political party
or movement (e.g. the 'Democrats' in the USA, or Uganda's People's
Democratic Army) or a specifc country (e.g. the Democratic Republic of
Congo). In addition, I identified them by entering 'war\*' in the basic
search feld. The words democracy (democr\*) and war (war\*) need to be
mentioned in title and/or abstract---and I also checked for equivalents
of 'war' like 'conflict' and 'dispute' and 'no peace'.5

As it is not feasible to analyse thousands of articles, it is necessary
to take a next step in the selection process. I decided to select these
articles, which will be part of the database for the third and fourth
chapter, in three different ways. The first method is to choose the
articles with the most citations. So, for example, in Chapter 3, the
articles which are cited more than a hundred times are included in this
first list. The article by Beck et al. (1998) has been cited more than
951 times, and as a consequence, this article is part of the database.
But also articles with a much lower number of citations (such as
Barbieri 1996, with 179 citations) are included in my analyses.

The second method is simply to include the most recent articles
published in the past five years, so since beginning 2011 until end
2015. The most recent articles can easily be overlooked by applying the
first method of most quoted articles. In my view, however, they still
need to be included as they present the most recent findings and engage
with the recent and innovative debates, which cannot be ignored in this
book. For example, recent studies on democracy and interstate war
(Chapter 3) have paid more attention to the mechanisms (see, e.g.,
Zeigler et al. 2014), and there is a growing attention for the impact of
political institutions in recent studies on democracy and intrastate war
(Chapter 4; see, e.g., Walter 2015). Those recent findings cannot be
ignored in any systematic analysis of statistical studies on this theme.

The third method is the most subjective approach of selecting articles,
as it is based on the 'snowballing method'. So it includes articles
which have not been selected by the first and second methods, but which
have been quoted extensively and regularly by the previously selected
articles. For example, the article by Bethany Lacina (2006) cannot be
selected based on having high citations (the first method) and it cannot
be included based on being a recent publication (the second method), but
it has been mentioned by key studies and hence surfaces via the
snowballing method (a third method). This article is important as it
**[clearly [distinguish]{.mark}]{.underline}**es [the]{.underline}
determinants of [**[conflict severity]{.mark}** from]{.underline} those
for **[conflict onset]{.underline}**, and [those [determinants
seem]{.mark} to be **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is
crucial information for Chapter 4.

In this way, my study presents and assesses the findings based on a big
pool of statistical studies in the published literature. Based on this
assessment, I will be able to draw clearer conclusions concerning the
significance of the effects of democracy on interstate war (this
chapter) and intrastate war (the next chapter). The Appendix shows more
detailed information of the selected articles.

The Democratic Peace Hypothesis, Its Roots and Supporters

The democratic peace hypothesis6 states that democracies never or seldom
go to war with one another. Where is this powerful idea of 'democratic
peace' coming from? Before discussing the main findings of the
statistical articles and before describing the four caveats of the
'democratic peace paradigm', we need to know a bit more around the
background and the roots of this idea.

Immanuel Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace has often been mentioned as
the foundation for this hypothesis. Kant believed peace was difficult to
achieve, since 'the natural state is one of war' (Kant 1795: 10). A
state of peace must therefore be established for---in his view---it is
certain that hostilities will be committed and people need to be
protected from each other. In such a world, each may treat his
neighbour, from whom he demands security, as an enemy. In a dictatorship
where 'the subjects are not citizens, a declaration of war is the
easiest thing in the world to decide upon, because war does not require
of the ruler, who is the proprietor and not a member of the state, the
least sacrifice of the pleasures of his table, the chase, his country
houses, his court functions, and the like. He may, therefore, resolve on
war as on a pleasure party for the most trivial reasons, and with
perfect indifference leave the justification which decency requires to
the diplomatic corps who are ever ready to provide it' (Kant 1795: 13).

In contrast, the situation is different in constitutional republics,
according to Kant. He argued that the majority of the people in
republics would never vote to go to war, except for pure self-defence.
Therefore, a world with only republics would be peaceful, since there
would be no aggressors. The republican constitution, which requires the
consent of the citizens to start a war, gives the positive prospect of
perpetual peace.

It is important to note that the ideas of Kant on the one hand and the
modern democratic peace scholars on the other hand are not completely
similar. For example, Kant talked about republics instead of democratic
states as the ideal states to achieve peace. He defined republican
states as states with representative governments, in which the
legislature is separated from the executive. Not
surprisingly---considering the epoch in which he lived---Kant did not
include universal suffrage in his definition, which is now seen as an
essential dimension of democracy, even of the most minimalist types of
democracy (Dahl 1971; see also Chapter 2). Moreover, Kant argued that
republics will be at peace in general, which means that such political
systems are expected to be not only in peace with each other, but also
with other non-republican systems. Nowadays, [**only few scholars**
would support]{.underline} this approach of [a '**monadic democratic
peace**']{.underline}. As will become clear at the end of this chapter,
[there is **[no]{.mark}t much [evidence]{.mark}** for the idea that
[democracies are **more peaceful in general**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the 1960s, most statistical studies have not focused on the
'monadic democratic peace hypothesis' but on testing the 'dyadic
democratic peace hypothesis'. This dyadic hypothesis states that it is
less likely that democracies fight with each other, compared to other
'dyads' or other pairs of different types of political systems. The
sociologist Dean Babst was the first scholar who started to build on
Kant's old idea in the 'dyadic' way, and decided to test it in
statistical studies (Babst 1964, 1972). He concluded that 'no wars have
been fought between independent nations with elective governments
between 1789 and 1941' (Babst 1972: 55). His study was not published in
one of the journals in the field of international relations, but in a
sociological journal and later in Industrial Research. Therefore, it was
not read by international relations scholars, and initially, it did not
get the attention it deserved in the field of international politics.

Babst's work was, for example, not cited by Melvin Small and J. David
Singer (1976), and their fndings seemed to contradict Babst's study.
However, Small and Singer did not compare the rates of war proneness for
democracies and dictatorships, but instead they focused on the question
whether wars involving democratic states have historically been
significantly different in length or in degree of violence compared to
wars involving only dictatorships. For length and degree of violence
during the wars, they did not find a difference between democracies and
dictatorships, so they concluded that types of political systems did not
matter.7 A few years later, Rudolph J. Rummel did cite Babst's work and
replicated Babst's idea in statistical tests, which were described in
the fourth book of his five-volume Understanding Confict and War (1975--
1981). He found clear support for his eleventh (of the 33) propositions
about causes and conditions of conflict, which stated that 'Libertarian
systems mutually preclude violence' (Rummel 1979: 279).

Eventually, those innovative studies from the 1970s helped to evoke the
interest in the democratic peace proposition, and in the expected
peaceful nature of relationships among democratic states. Since the
1980s, the number of quantitative studies has increased considerably,
accumulating into an impressive field of research in international
relations with its own 'empirical law' of democratic peace (Levy 1989:
270; see also Ray 1998).

This democratic peace hypothesis has not only received support from
political scientists, but also from politicians and policy makers.
Particularly since 1993, the idea of a democratic peace has inspired
American foreign policies aimed at the promotion of peace and democracy.
As the 42nd president of the USA (1993--2001), Bill Clinton was the
first politician who explicitly bridged the gap between these findings
in international relations on the one hand, and his foreign policy
strategy on the other hand, at least rhetorically. Anthony Lake, who was
Clinton's National Security Adviser, stated in 1993 that in order to
cope with America's foreign policy challenges, the expansion of
democratic states around the world would be essential because 'it
protects our \[U.S.\] interests and security' (see Henderson 2002: 20).
In his 1994 State of the Union, Clinton declared that 'Ultimately, the
best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack
each other'.8 Findings from research in the field of international
relations seemed to have a direct impact on policy making, and this move
of the Clinton administration can be seen as 'a textbook case of
arbitrage between the ivory tower and the real world' (Gowa 1999: 109).

Clinton's successor, George W. Bush, went one big step further in his
faith that democratic peace holds. He argued that efforts to turn Iraq
into a democratic country would have positive effects on Iraqi's
neighbours. The authoritarian regimes in the region would fall as domino
stones and follow the Iraqi example. They would start democratizing as
soon as they could, which would then result in achieving a peaceful and
stable the Middle East. The real motives for attacking Iraq may have
been different, but 'regime change' was at the heart of Washington's
rhetoric when the USA started to bomb Baghdad in March 2003. The
rhetoric of the Bush administration focused on toppling Saddam Hussein's
regime, and replacing the entire underlying dictatorial system with a
democracy.

Moreover, George W. Bush used the democratic peace idea to justify the
war in Iraq, declaring, 'The reason why I'm so strong on democracy is
democracies don't go to war with each other...I've got great faith in
democracies to promote peace. And that's why I'm such a strong believer
that the way forward in the Middle East, the broader Middle East, is to
promote democracy'.9 In 2004, the 43rd President of the USA said: 'If
you think you can have peace without democracy -- again - I think you'll
find that - I can only speak for myself, that I will be extremely
doubtful that it will ever happen'.10 In his second inaugural address,
he stated that 'the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends
on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world'.

Again, these are just words from speeches and can hence be seen as
rhetoric to defend military intervention (cf. Jervis 2003; Kaufmann
2004; Daalder and Lindsay 2005; Owen 2005; Lieberfeld 2005; Schmidt and
Williams 2008). Still, in the end, politicians have rationalized their
political decisions based on one of the most powerful ideas taken from
studies in the field of international relations, clearly showing the
influence of this academic idea in political practice.

Hence, the field of international relations seems to have its own law:
democracies rarely fight with each other. It cannot be denied that the
evidence supporting the democratic peace proposition is quite diverse in
character (see Ray 1998): the evidence has been epistemological (Rummel
1975), philosophical (Doyle 1986), formal (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
1992), historical (Weart 1994; Ray 1995; Owen 1994), experimental (Mintz
and Geva 1993), anthropological (Ember et al. 1992; Crawford 1994),
psychological (Kegley and Hermann 1995), economic (Brawley 1993; Weede
1996) and political (Gaubatz 1991). Still, there have been numerous
critical studies (see, i.e., Hayes 2011), and the general picture is
unclear. We do not yet know much about the overall findings from
statistical studies.

So far, it seems as if some quantitative studies---mainly within the
field of international relations---have found strong and robust evidence
which supports the 'democratic peace hypothesis'. Those studies show
that democracy has had a positive influence on international peace (see,
i.e., Rummel 1979; Ray and Russett 1996). In this sense, the idea of a
democratic peace seems to be confirmed. Political scientists such as
James Lee Ray are passionate supporters: 'No scientific evidence is
entirely definitive' but 'based on all the empirical evidence so far'
the more defensible of the two possible definitive answers to the
question "Does democracy cause peace?" is "Yes" (Ray 1998: 43). However,
based on my own analyses of the empirical studies with statistical
evidence, I cannot be as enthusiastic as those scholars; to the
contrary, I whole-heartily disagree with them, as a more systematic
analysis of the articles shows that there are four important weaknesses,
which seriously undermines the idea that peace is one of democracy's
instrumental values.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

While analysing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms (see next section, caveat 2), and hence seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this way, the
majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the idea
that democratic peace actually exists without testing this proposition.
However, **[no]{.underline}**ne of the [**studies** that **directly
test** the democratic peace]{.underline} hypothesis [found **strong
evidence** that democracy is the **most important factor** when
explaining interstate war]{.underline}. All democratic peace studies
have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace, such
as [economic development and growth, geographic distance and contiguity,
power status, alliance ties, militarization and political
stability]{.underline}. The findings show that it is not just democracy
which explains war, not at all. Within this group of studies, which
explicitly test the democratic peace hypothesis, four different types of
findings can be detected. I will discuss those results more in-depth in
the rest of this section.

First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Significant Too

The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically significant as well (Maoz and Russett
1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck et al. 1998;
Ray 2013). For example, some studies (e.g. Rousseau et al. 1996)
included alternative independent variables in order to test realist
arguments. They tested whether the distribution of power determines
decisions to use force, and measures each state's military capabilities
relative to its opponent. A state's military capability is the average
of three elements: number of troops, military expenditures and military
expenditures per soldier. They found that this realist variable was
strong, positive and statistically significant at the 0.001 level in
their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However,
not only a state's military capabilities appeared to be an important
explanation for peace. In addition, wealth, growth, alliances and
contiguity played a crucial role when explaining interstate war (see,
e.g., Maoz and Russett 1993: 632, Table 1).11 Moreover, [[when]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** are [included]{.mark}, the **impact of
[democracy]{.mark}** on the likelihood of international crises
[is]{.mark} **even [spurious]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett
1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141, see also p. 3).12 Still, scholars in
this group keep defending the democratic peace idea, despite the fact
that their own analyses showed the significance of alternative
explanations.

Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models

The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau 2013; Gartzke
and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate the spuriousness
of the statistical democratic peace pointed to [other
factors]{.underline} that, [when accounted for '**properly'**,
**eliminated**]{.underline} or dramatically reduced [the statistical
significance of shared democracy]{.underline}. Hence, the studies in
this second group did not find strong evidence for the democratic peace
hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were included in the
models.14

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that [there is **no democratic peace**, but a **capitalist
peace instead**]{.underline}. The settlement in Germany and Japan
succeeded because of the establishment of capitalist peace. Because of
economic support by the Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered
trade opportunities in practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe
and Japan would gain economically, resulting in 'economic growth,
prosperity, and, ultimately, free trade among most of the more
technologically advanced economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By
establishing and expanding free trade, the incentives for war would
quickly decrease among trading states, according to this approach. To
prevent new interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was
a far more important factor than the American promotion of democracy and
its political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014).
[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [peace]{.mark} **only [exists]{.mark}** [when
both]{.mark} democracies [have **high**]{.mark} **levels of economic
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when economic development is well
above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and **[the
[poorest]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4--5% of current [[**democracies**,
are]{.mark} **significantly [more likely]{.mark}** than other kinds of
political systems [to **fight each other**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Mousseau 2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies
involved has a very low level of economic development, then democracy
cannot prevent war.16 Still, there is a pacifying effect of [free trade
and economic interdependence]{.underline}, which [is **more important**
than the effect of democracy]{.underline}, because the former affects
peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development
and ultimately, democracy (see Weede 2004).17

Capitalist peace is not the only alternative explanation. Shared
interests in general, and political similarities in specific, can also
be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and peace
between countries (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997; Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999;
Henderson 2002). [Democracies are **not peaceful** to each other because
they are **democratic**, but rather because they are
**similar**]{.underline}. So the difference of the scores of both
countries also contributes to the conflict proneness of the dyad. If the
difference in levels of democracy is big, then the chance of conflict is
higher (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it difficult to distinguish
between the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the first scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefits of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger

This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for peace
(and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies in
the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically significant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war (Bremer 1992; Gelpi
1997; Oneal and Russett 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002; Peterson 2013;
Caselli et al. 2015).

Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that [democracy is
**not the most important factor**]{.underline}, while war is more likely
to occur between states that are geographically proximate, approximately
equal in power, major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly
militarized than between those that are not. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, [multivariate analyses revealed some
differences]{.underline}. Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that
some factors are far more important than others. [The existence of a
**dangerous, [war]{.mark}-prone dyad** can be **[best explained
by]{.mark}** the **presence of [contiguity]{.mark}**, the **absence of
an [alliance]{.mark}** and the **absence of more advanced
economy**]{.underline}. The absence of democratic polity and other
factors (absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of major
power) are less powerful. Overall, these findings suggest that our
research priorities may be seriously distorted and that we should not
focus too much on the perceived positive impact of democracy, but on
other factors (such as alliances and economic factors) instead.

Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions

The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors. The chance of
democratic peace depends not just on the specific historical period
(Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons 1991;
Weede 1984), but also the stage of the conflict (beginning, duration or
severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed 2000), and on the
neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the region; see Gibler
and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013). Despite the differences
between the studies, there is one common finding in all studies: when
explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on the impact of
democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some specific historical periods. Based on
this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War. For example, Henry Farber and
Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea that peace
between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the threat from
the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another (see
also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued that most of
the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after
World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which
can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and
maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
conflict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the
benefits of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). Moreover, jointly democratic
dyads are likely to be allied only after 1945 (see Gibler and Sarkees
2004); during the 1816--1944 time period, there is even a negative
relationship between democratic dyads and alliance formation.20 These
findings cast serious doubts on the idea of a general existence of
democratic peace.

Not only the historical period, but also [the ***stage*** of the
conflict is crucial]{.underline}. Some scholars in this group provided
evidence that [democratic peace is **not universal**]{.underline}, but
that it depends on the stage and whether we focus on the beginning,
duration or severity of the conflict. Although joint democracy has some
pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results suggest that
they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to war (see Reed 2000).
Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the neighbourhood
instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues over which to
contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region. Democracies only
seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours, and therefore
they can more easily choose favourable conflicts to escalate. The type
of political system does not predict conflict selection or victory once
controls are added for issue salience (Gibler and Miller 2013; see also
Park and James 2015). There is an interaction between joint democracy
and regional instability, which confirms the idea that the effects of
type of political system on continued conflict apply mostly to dyads in
peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see also Park and James
2015). [**Very democratic countries** might]{.underline} even [become
**more aggressive** and **faster** than other political systems, once
the **region** becomes more hostile]{.underline} (see, e.g., Baliga et
al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries (Table 3.1).

Caveat 2: What Are the Causal Mechanisms?

Most of the statistical studies on democratic peace seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war; based on this
assumption, they then decide to focus on the mechanisms. This is
problematic as none of the democratic peace studies found strong
evidence that democracy is the most important factor when explaining
interstate war (see the previous section). As a consequence, the next
step of looking for mechanisms is quite irrelevant and not necessary in
my view, but most studies nevertheless argue that the field lacks strong
theoretical foundations and robust empirical evidence that can reveal
convincing causal mechanisms.22 Those studies seem to accept the
correlation between dyadic democracy and peace, and then start
questioning whether democracy really causes peace before investigating
potential mechanisms.

VI\. THE INTERLOCKING CRISES

In this Part, we highlight how the vulnerabilities of democracy are made
salient as well as exacerbated by climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene. We also emphasize how [**climate change** and **other
problems** of the Anthropocene place **democracies** that attempt to
navigate them in a **particularly impervious Scylla and Charybdis**-like
situation]{.underline}.173 [The Scylla is **ineffective policy**; the
Charybdis is some **relaxation of** the core democratic principle of
**popular sovereignty**. Both options seem nearly **guaranteed** to
trigger **significant legitimacy challenges** to **liberal democratic
systems**]{.underline}.

Traditionally, two important sources of democratic legitimacy have been
beneficial consequences, in the utilitarian tradition, and consent, in
the social contract tradition.174 Whatever else may count as beneficial
consequences, the capacity to solve problems that threaten the physical
and social security of citizens is a central and important source of
democratic legitimacy.175 Call this the "public utility" view of
democratic legitimacy. And whatever else may count as consent, surely
the fact that the majority of citizens have expressed their preference
for a certain candidate, law, or policy is an important source of
democratic legitimacy as well.176 Call this the "expressed preference"
view of democratic legitimacy.

Consider public utility first. As we have pointed out, most
[contemporary **democracies** have]{.underline} thus far [**failed** to
address]{.underline} the **[emerging problems]{.underline}** of the
Anthropocene.177 Consequently, the sense of physical and social
insecurity grows more acute amongst citizens as the problems mount and
compound.178 The legitimacy of these democracies, and the supranational
institutions they have created, such as the European Union and the
United Nations, is thus compromised on public utility grounds.

Now consider expressed preference. [[The **global scope**]{.mark},
long-term reach, unprecedented features, [and **highly complex** nature
of **climate change** and **other problems**]{.mark} of the Anthropocene
[require]{.mark} democracies to make robust commitments to
**[multilateral coop]{.mark}eration**, **[long-term planning]{.mark}**,
significant deviations from the status quo, [and]{.mark} increased
reliance on **[expert knowledge]{.mark}** if they are to succeed in
managing these problems]{.underline}. 179 Citizens' expressed
preferences may be quite distant from this network of commitments and
activities,180 since the benefits of successfully managing a problem
like climate change would mostly accrue not to these citizens, but to
spatiotemporally distant people (i.e., the global poor and future
generations) and genetically distant (non-human) nature. 181 Attempting
to force such commitments, especially at a time when democracies are
already being accused of not being responsive enough to their citizens,
can further compromise legitimacy.182

[We thus face an apparent dilemma: **[if democracies fail]{.mark}** to
successfully address climate change and other problems of the
Anthropocene, [their **legitimacy will be challenged** on **public
utility**]{.mark} grounds. **[If they aggressively]{.mark} attempt to
[address them]{.mark}**[, their **legitimacy will**]{.mark} **likely [be
challenged]{.mark}** [on **expressed preference**]{.mark} grounds.
**[Either way]{.mark}**, we can [**expect** the **power** of
**populist**]{.mark} figures and **[movements to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The remainder of this Part illuminates this dilemma by discussing how
[climate change and other problems]{.underline} of the Anthropocene
[interact [with]{.mark}]{.underline} some further **[[democratic
vulnerabilities:]{.underline}]{.mark}** weak multilateralism,
short-termism, the profusion of veto players, the contested role of
experts, and self-referring decision making.

A. **[[Weak Multilateralism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Climate change cannot be successfully managed without a strong
commitment to international cooperation.183 For a climate regime to
succeed, it must be effective, perceived as at least not unfair by all
parties, and otherwise acceptable to each party.184 At various times,
the attempt to create a regime has foundered on each of these three
considerations.185

From the beginning of the negotiations that led to the adoption of the
FCCC in 1992 and in subsequent negotiations under the Convention, the
question of fairness has been unavoidable.186 When agreements have been
structured in ways that are acceptable to developing countries (e.g.,
the Kyoto Protocol) they have been perceived as unfair by the United
States.187 This has led to the weakening of commitments and to a regime
whose effectiveness is in question.188 The Paris Agreement, by putting
voluntary pledges at the center, was designed to avoid the problem of
perceived unfairness.189 It was reasonably thought that no party could
say that they had been unfairly treated when they have agreed to be
measured in relation to a commitment that they have voluntarily
undertaken and to which no sanctions are attached for non-compliance.
190 Nevertheless, that was exactly the claim made by President Trump in
announcing his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris
Agreement.191 Moreover, the cost of creating an agreement to which no
one could reasonably object was to create an Agreement whose
effectiveness was in question even before the United States announced
its intention to withdraw.192

While climate change is its own "full tragedy and weird comedy," 193
there are structural issues at work.194 As the world order attempts to
adjust to shifting power distributions following the emergence of new
giants such as China and India, when it comes to problems such as
climate change the cooperation of such countries is no longer just
desirable but essential.195 As their collaboration becomes more
valuable, the price for obtaining it rises accordingly.196 This
complicates negotiations, and the problem seems only destined to worsen
because this logic applies not only to presently emerging world powers,
but also to those that have already emerged and those that will emerge
in the future. As we observed in an earlier paper, "\[g\]lobal
governance in the Anthropocene is cooperation-hungry, and this increases
the price of obtaining cooperation from every country."197

In addition, [**democracies** have their own **particular problems**
when it comes to **multilateral agreements**. Except in the rare case
where they are able to steer multilateral agreements in the way they
prefer, democratic governments "[often **seek to avoid
compliance**]{.mark} with binding **multilateral decisions** if [this
**weakens their relationship to their
electorate**]{.mark}]{.underline}."198 [This is in fact what happened in
the case of]{.underline} President [Trump's repudiation of the Paris
Agreement]{.underline}.199 The stated reason was the agreement's
unfairness to the United States.200 However, the deeper reason was that
the Obama administration's decision to join, although admittedly an act
of national self-determination, was not in fact an authentic deliverance
of American popular sovereignty, at least in the eyes of Trump and his
supporters.201 According to Trump,

> \[t\]he Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of
> Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United
> States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American
> workers -- who \[sic\] I love -- and taxpayers to absorb the cost in
> terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly
> diminished economic production.202

In the same speech Trump reminded his audience that "I was elected to
represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."203

In democracies, it is ultimately citizens who empower their
representatives to bargain and strike terms of international
cooperation.204 Successfully addressing the problems of the Anthropocene
is likely to require unprecedented levels of multilateralism.205
Democratic states that attempt to rise to the challenge are likely to
face legitimacy challenges on expressed preference grounds. Those that
do not may face legitimacy challenges on public utility grounds.

B. **[[Short-termism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Short-termism can be defined as "the priority given to present net
benefits at the cost of future ones."206 Short-termism is a problem
whenever policy domains have an extended timeframe, as is the case with
climate change and other systemic problems of the Anthropocene.207 In
these cases, present net benefits may need to be curtailed (through
increases in taxes and regulations, for example) for the sake of
benefits that might materialize in the distant future. These future
benefits will then mostly advantage people other than those who have
borne the costs. Reasons for privileging the present in these cases
include pure time preference, uncertainty, and diminished or even null
moral concern for those who might benefit in the future.208 The
temptation, then, is to eschew the costs of the required policies and
"pass the buck" to future generations.209

Short-termism is not always irrational nor morally wrong.210 It has been
argued, however, that short-termism is both irrational and morally wrong
in the case of climate change.211 The sources of short-termism are
rooted in human psychology and can manifest in any kind of political
regime.212 However, it has been argued that democracies are particularly
vulnerable to short-termism.213

[One important reason for the short-termism of democratic political
regimes is that these regimes inherit, via voting and other forms of
popular influence, their citizens' biases in favor of the present.
**[Policies]{.mark}** may also]{.underline} reflect [citizens'
**[misinformation]{.mark}** about, or unawareness of, long-term
processes, risks, policy aims, and possible outcomes]{.underline}.214
[[To counter]{.mark} these tendencies, liberal democracies [typically
filter]{.mark} their citizens' inter-temporal biases, misinformation,
and unawareness [through]{.mark} such mechanisms as constitutions and
reliance on **[expert bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.215 [[Yet the **more
filtering**]{.mark} they do, [the **more likely**]{.mark} they
[are]{.mark} to incur **[legitimacy challenges]{.mark}** on expressed
preference grounds]{.underline}.216 This is a problem of
intra-generational legitimacy.217

There are also problems of inter-generational legitimacy.218 There is no
guarantee that long-term policies, if enacted, will achieve the
anticipated aims, or that they will indeed make future people better off
by achieving these aims.219 If things do not work out, these policies
might be deemed illegitimate on public utility grounds by the very
future people that they were supposed to benefit.220 In addition, such
policies may be deemed illegitimate by future people on expressed
preference grounds.221 Legitimacy on expressed preference grounds
typically requires some form of authorization by those who are affected
by policies, yet future people who will be affected by past policies
never authorize them, nor can they hold anyone accountable.222

[Another reason for democracies' short-termism is the scheduling of
participatory events]{.underline}.223 Democracy requires elections,
which must be relatively frequent in order to ensure that people can
regularly express their will, vote out politicians who are judged to
have failed in some important ways, and prevent rent-seeking behavior by
not giving politicians enough time to set up camp within
institutions.224 However, [the relatively **short duration of electoral
cycles** ensures that politicians are constantly concerned with their
own reelection, and this may prevent them from taking hard policy
decisions that require a great deal of political capital and do not
produce appreciable outcomes in time for the next
election]{.underline}.225 [Because most of the **[impacts]{.mark}** of
climate change will largely **materialize in the future** and be felt by
future generations, efforts at their alleviation must obey a clock that
is **[not in sync with the electoral clock]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Note that there is no need to assume that politicians are always and
necessarily motivated by only a thirst for power.226 In a democ- racy,
even politicians who are exclusively motivated by the aspiration to make
good long-term policy need to be elected or re-elected to do so.227 In
order to be elected, they need to harness the votes of the current
electorate.228 So, the problem of short-termism goes beyond a lack of
conscientious far-sightedness on the side of politicians: it is
structurally connected to the very fact of popular sovereignty---at
least as long as the majority of people discount the future.229

C. **[[Veto Players]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Any political system (with the possible exclusion of some forms of
anarchy) accords veto powers to some agent: a monarchy to the king, an
aristocracy to the nobility, a technocracy to the experts, a theocracy
to the religious leader, and so on.230 A veto player in a political
system can be understood as an agent who can prevent a departure from
the status quo.231 In democracies, veto players can be specified by
constitutions (e.g., the President and the Congress in the United
States), emerge from the political system (e.g., the Supreme Court in
the United States, political parties that are members of a government
coalition in Western Europe), or from civil society (e.g., powerful
industries, unions or other interest groups in many countries).232

In a democracy, veto players can protect minority interests, prevent
destabilizing change, and preserve important values and policies through
periods in which they are unpopular.233 More generally, veto players
prevent a democratic system from being excessively fluid and
flexible.234 This is attractive when the status quo is desirable or an
exogenous shock is beneficial; however, when the status quo is
undesirable or an exogenous shock disturbs a desirable status quo,
fluidity and flexibility are needed in order to respond quickly

and decisively.235 This is arguably the situation in the case of climate

change, which demands nimble political responses to which veto

players would have to acquiesce.

[The presence of many veto players threatens to delay or even block the
formulation and implementation of policy]{.underline}.236 Liberal
democracies, with their reliance on checks and balances generated by
institutional architecture or by competition among interest groups, seem
particularly vulnerable to such threats---and the more veto players in a
democracy the greater the degree of vulnerability.237

[An **especially high concentration of veto players** helps to explain
why a powerful, rich, technological leader like the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is **uncannily slow** to address consequential
public issues such as the politics of distribution, racial equality,
immigration, the proper balance between liberty and national security,
and of course climate change]{.underline}.238 The United States
Constitution separates powers in the federal government, reserves a
broad range of powers to states and includes a bill of rights that can
be viewed as effectively giving veto powers to individuals in some
circumstances. Practices have also developed through time that inhibit
action, such as requiring supermajorities for some political decisions.

[The profusion of **veto players** may be extreme in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [but it [is]{.mark} a feature
[common to]{.mark} many **[liberal democracies]{.mark}** that often
[makes]{.mark} political [action **elusive**]{.mark} even on relatively
minor policy issues]{.underline}.239 For every possible policy change,
there is always a "do-nothing" alternative (sometimes more respectably
presented as a "wait and see" alternative) that is invariably attractive
to some veto player.240

"Do-nothing" alternatives may sometimes be justified on grounds of
rational choice considerations relating to transition costs and
uncertainty about both the process of transition and the final pay-off
structure.241 Veto players give voice to such considerations, as well as
other considerations that we have already noted.242 But veto players may
also give voice to less rational tendencies, which are inevitably
present and, in democracies, are crystallized in votes. Among these
tendencies may be disproportionate attention to sunk costs, finding
refuge in "what has always worked," fear of regretting the changes made,
the desire to maintain and transmit a sense of control by not acceding
to the demands of new circumstances, and lack of trust in those who are
proposing the changes.243

Veto players tend to slow down or block deviations from the status quo,
and this makes it difficult to tackle climate change and other similar
problems of the Anthropocene.244 But veto players also reflect and
configure real structures of power, and protect and promote the needs
and interests of actual people.245 When the number of veto players or
the importance of specific veto players is altered, new power structures
emerge and this can raise legitimacy challenges on both utility and
expressed preference grounds.246 It is not obvious what veto players
should be eliminated or demoted in order to produce more nimble and
effective climate policy, and which ones should be given additional
power instead. Nor is it obvious who should decide the answers to these
questions (if not the people) and on what grounds (if not majority
rule).

Veto players configure systems of checks and balances, filters and
buffers, which are only partially exposed to popular influence.247 This
anti-majoritarian service is particularly precious to liberal
democracies, which rely on veto players to protect and promote the
rights of individuals and minorities---and, with that, the core liberal
principles of individual liberty and human rights. However, as a
consequence, if a majority exists that is overwhelmingly convinced by
climate science, totally in favor of leaving all remaining fossil energy
sources in the ground, and ready to embark on ambitious renewable energy
programs, this majority may still find it difficult to act. Liberal
democracies protect minorities of various kinds in varying degrees, and
these include climate change denialists and those who profit from fossil
fuels. Economically powerful and en- trenched economic minorities (the
"1%") are often extremely effective veto players.248 This can prevent
action that would benefit most people, thus increasing the risks of
legitimacy challenges.

D. **[Contested Role of Experts]{.underline}**

Climate change and other problems of the Anthropocene are unprecedented
phenomena whose complexity and implications are only beginning to be
understood by scientists and other experts. Climate change is a
multidimensional problem that concerns and connects ecology, demography,
development, production, consumption, resource use, trade rules, health,
security, urban planning, mobility, migration, and more, in novel
ways.249 It poses threats that are multi-scalar, probabilistic,
indirect, often invisible, spatiotemporally unbound, and potentially
catastrophic. These threats challenge our reason, emotions, and
imagination.250 If there were ever a complex problem that required
expert knowledge, it is climate change.

Liberal democracies make significant use of expert knowledge in
policymaking in various ways to protect liberal values, and to boost
their efficiency, equity, and political stability.251 Expert knowledge
is distinguished from non-expert opinion through such criteria as
experience, professional and educational qualifications, peer-review,
and rules of evidence.252

Still, in a democracy, differences in expertise do not translate to
differences in political authority, for much the same reason why
differences in lineage do not translate in this way. A democratic
citizen can recognize expertise and accept the science of, say, climate
change, and still object to the expert who counsels some course of
action: "You may be right, but who made you boss?"253 In a democracy,
expertise is always subservient to the voice of the people (pace Plato,
philosophers cannot be kings).254

For this reason, the relationships between experts and ordinary citizens
are always potentially fraught in a democracy. These relationships vary
from country to country, time to time, and issue to issue. Often, the
relationships are placid in good times and rocky in hard times. Major
policy failures, such as the global financial crisis of 2008 and the
spreading of terrorist radicalization in many European Union countries,
can lead citizens to question experts' knowledge and see them as just
another interest group seeking rents at people's expense.255

In the case of climate change, an additional element makes the role of
experts potentially unpopular. Climate science, in our present social
context, inevitably provokes fundamental questions about how we ought to
live and organize our societies, throwing doubt on the ways in which we
do so now. A particularly powerful and widespread attempt to avoid
cognitive dissonance through various forms of rationalization may thus
come into play. After all, if something potentially catastrophic such as
climate change can result from the very ways in which we live our
everyday lives---how we dwell, how we eat, how we make things, how we
move around---the nagging thought is that there might be something
fundamentally wrong about the ways in which we live. These are not
comfortable thoughts and can lead to resentment or worse towards those
who bear the message.

The incipient conflict and simmering resentment has been exploited by
powerful interests who look to be the immediate losers from a transition
to a more sustainable way of life. They stoke the dissonance and
encourage denialism. The most obvious manifestation of this is the
climate change denial campaign, directed towards preventing the
formation of a consensus for political action on climate change.256

The main strategy of climate change denialists has been to suppress both
belief in the science and belief that there is a scientific consensus on
the existence, anthropogenic nature, and dangerousness of climate
change.257 In its aims and strategies, climate change denialism has
replicated earlier forms of denialism involving tobacco smoking, acid
rain, DDT, and ozone depletion. 258

The rhetorical techniques adopted by climate change denialism have also
not been particularly original: versions of these techniques were used
in all the other cases mentioned above. These techniques include
attacking sources rather than discussing evidence, "moving the goalpost"
by requesting ever larger amounts of evidence, submitting false
evidence, suggesting false equivalences or analogies, confusing
ignorance about mechanisms or processes with ignorance about facts or
outcomes, cherry-picking anomalies, selective skepticism, quote mining,
and the so-called "Gish gallop"---overwhelming discussants or audiences
with unscientific claims to make it difficult to counter all the
misinformation at once.259

What is new about denialism in the Anthropocene is not its strategies or
tactics, but its amplification. Expertise denialism now travels through
social media, which allows for unfiltered instant communication among
citizens and between citizens and representatives. Traditional
intermediaries---political parties, intellectuals, and the professional
press---are increasingly made redundant by these technologies. Indeed,
to maintain their relevance (and market share), these traditional
intermediaries often seek to replicate the immediacy and excitement of
social media, compromising their own claims to epistemological or
institutional privilege.

One effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is an increased tendency to
brand political ideas and policy proposals and to market them as
products.260 The need to engage audiences with arguments and relevant
facts---and even to maintain consistency in one's opinions--- decreases,
while the need for a good, resonant, quick-win pitch increases. With
that, the importance of expert knowledge is downplayed to the advantage
of skilled branding and marketing.

Another effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is a polarizing fragmentation,
not just at the level of policy judgments, but also regarding the sets
of facts to which different individuals and groups make reference.
Social media allows for networked, yet highly fragmented, political
communication, making it harder to individuate and even debate a common
story.261

Much empirical work in psychology, economics, political science,
sociology, and communications has gone into trying to explain how and
why disagreement about facts can occur.262 The explanation seems to be
some sort of "biased assimilation," whereby people adjust their view of
facts with reference to their self-defining values, social identities,
and partisan allegiances.263 Experiments on reception suggest that
individuals selectively credit or dismiss information in a manner that
reinforces beliefs congenial to their values.264 These experiments found
that subjects were substantially more likely to count a scientist as an
authoritative "expert" when the scientist was depicted as taking a
position consistent with the subjects' cultural predispositions, than
when that scientist took a contrary position.265 Interestingly, these
tendencies seem to be directly, rather than inversely, related to levels
of science literacy and general education of experimental subjects: the
more equipped people are to know and understand the facts, the more they
disagree on them.266

In times of social media, these tendencies may be amplified, insofar as
individuals tend to gravitate towards and engage mostly with resonant
networks of "like-me's" that by and large reaffirm their own values and
perspectives.267 This may tribalize positions and impede constructive
democratic engagement and debate from ever taking off on many contested
issues. In addition, one can expect increasing polarization to also be
fomented by individuals and groups trying to secure loyalty to their
branded political ideas and policy proposals in this way.

The internet and other media, with their seemingly endless resources,
create the impression that expertise can be picked and chosen at will,
thereby feeding the perception of public life as a spectacle.268 Public
discussions, unfiltered by "moderators," unfold in a denuded space
stripped of epistemological norms.269 In the United States at least,
this has morphed into a generalized atmosphere of expertise denialism
writ large. Denialism about evolution, vaccines, economics, and more has
become commonplace.270

It is not an exaggeration to say that we are on the verge of adopting
epistemological nihilism as a public epistemology.271 No commitment to
facts, in the traditional sense, or even consistency of opinion, is
required.272 Truth is what the speaker says it is, here and now. In a
moment it may be different, depending on what the speaker can get away
with. In a democracy, it is up to elections or approval ratings to
resolve disagreements. It is a short step from here to other exercises
of power.

The nihilistic turn in public epistemology threatens the legitimacy of
democracy, for democracy cannot solve the problems it faces without
mobilizing epistemological authority that is itself hostage to popular
vote. As difficult as this challenge may be in favorable times, it is
greatly magnified in the face of climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene.

E. Self-referring Decision-making

What we have elsewhere called the "agency presupposition" is deeply
entrenched in modern democratic theory. This presupposition holds "that
the political community is constituted by agents who initiate and
conduct political action, and who themselves, and their interests and
welfare, are what matter politically."273 The agency presupposition
arose at a time in which democratic principles, norms and institutions
were being developed to govern relations between agents who lived in
close proximity to one another in space and time, and whose decisions
and actions had relatively direct impacts on each other. However, around
1950, a profound change occurred from a world of discrete but
interdependent states to a world of shared social space in which distant
events have localized impacts and vice-versa. In this globalized world,
the fates of nation-states and their peoples became not just effectively
interdependent, but also structurally interconnected, with social,
political, and economic activities, interactions, and infrastructures
stretching beyond political frontiers, leading to a deepening enmeshment
of the local and the global.274 Political decisions and actions taken
locally (in selected powerful countries, many of which were democratic)
now systematically had planetary implications, impacting for better or
worse the welfare and interests of people in all corners of the world.

With the Anthropocene disruption of earth's fundamental ecological
systems, including those that govern climate, political agents (living
humans who can initiate and conduct political action) have gained
unprecedented power over a vast universe of non-agents that comprises
animate and inanimate nature as well as those living on the periphery of
both space and time.275 The circle of affected nonagents has expanded
beyond cultural, genetic, and spatiotemporal boundaries to include
virtually everything on the planet, now extended indefinitely in
time.276 This establishes an enormous asymmetry of power. Those on the
periphery, and nature, cannot initiate and conduct political action:
they cannot reciprocate, they cannot participate, they cannot protest,
they cannot retaliate.277 In democratic terms, they do not matter---or
only matter derivatively, if political agents care about their fate. And
it is as undemocratic as can be, particularly if the democracy in
question is a liberal democracy, to force political agents to care if
they do not.278

A phenomenon like climate change creates ubiquitous tensions and
trade-offs between agents and non-agents---those who are governed, and
those who are affected.279 The latter will suffer most from climate
change, but a democracy responsive to the claims of future generations
(or those living beyond its borders, or nonhuman nature) may often have
to forgo opportunities for bringing beneficial consequences to those who
empower it with their votes.280 Instead, democratic leaders would have
to enact policies favoring the interests of those who do not vote
because they do not yet exist (or live in different countries or are not
human).

Democracies making policies that favor non-agents will expose themselves
to intra-generational legitimacy challenges on both public utility
grounds and expressed preference grounds.281 Even if the expected
benefits to non-agents were great, such non-agent-oriented policies
might not win the hearts, minds, and guts of living human agents who may
express their preference for themselves instead--- particularly in
democracies that are already being accused of not being responsive
enough to their citizens.282 Many believe that ignoring or heavily
discounting the welfare and interests of non-agents is morally wrong,
but if expressed preference is important, it may be a wrong that
democracies cannot avoid committing.283

The agency presupposition makes government responsive to those who are
governed but not to those who are affected beyond borders in space,
time, citizenship, or genetic make-up. A basic presupposition of liberal
democracy appears to be threatened by the very actions that would have
to be taken to express concern for all those affected by the
climate-changing and eco-altering actions of its citizens.

VII\. CONCLUSION

We began this Article by explaining the notion of the Anthropocene and
briefly telling the story of failed responses to climate change. We went
on to discuss the uneasy relationship between climate change and
democracy, focusing on liberal democracy in particular. We presented
some basic aspects of democratic theory and practice, and discussed some
of democracy's main vulnerabilities. We showed how in the Anthropocene
these vulnerabilities can magnify, leading to legitimacy challenges.

[These legitimacy challenges are not new. Democracy has always been
haunted by anxiety about its future]{.underline}. Some political
theorists have argued that [**[democracy]{.mark}** is the only form of
political organization that **[underwrites]{.mark}** the seeds of **[its
own destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.284 [Demagogues and extremists
who wish to blow up the state are allowed the same freedoms as those who
seek to manage it more fairly and effectively]{.underline}. [The risk of
a [**democratically enabled democide** is **not**]{.mark} an
[**abstract** or **counterfactual**]{.mark} risk: the executioners of
German democracy came to power through the rules and procedures of the
**Weimar Republic**]{.underline}.285 If we open our eyes, we may see
these stories going on around us today.

Modern democracy is, in many respects, the most sophisticated
articulation of the human capacity for social organization. It is also
the most hospitable environment for the expression of human values that,
through centuries of emancipatory struggles, have come to be regarded as
fundamental, such as individual liberty and political equality.286 Our
objective in this Article is not to write a requiem for democracy, but
rather to chart the seas that democratic theory and practice will have
to navigate in order to successfully address climate change and survive
the challenges of the Anthropocene. We have highlighted the
vulnerabilities of democracy in order to throw in sharp relief the many
challenges entailed by the voyage, not to discourage it. Democracy has
shown itself to be remarkably resilient in the past, and it may well
succeed in rising to these challenges as well. There are those who think
that democracy doesn't stand a chance.287 But many still believe that
the only solution to the problems of the Anthropocene lies in more,
better, or different democracy.288 And there are those who think that
even if democracy fails these challenges, democracy itself will not have
failed. For they see its value as intrinsic, and not just as a means to
better or more effective governance.289

It is difficult to sketch the nature of possible democratic solutions to
some of the issues that we have raised, and we will not try to do so
here. Instead, we will close with a summary of what seems to be the main
challenge ahead. The existing democratic deficits in liberal countries
will generally have to be reduced. Yet, in the case of climate change
and other problems of the Anthropocene, liberal democratic countries
will have to muster both the internal coherence and strength to better
resist populism, and the external coherence and strength to be more
cooperative partners within the framework of supranational institutions.
This is necessary because, in the Anthropocene, the global spills into
the domestic and vice-versa: a globally changing climate may have
pernicious local impacts on the territory and population of any given
country, while [[**political dysfunction in one country**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} cripple **[[\[halt\] efforts at global
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The democracies of the Anthropocene will have to work at multiple scales
in both space and time, incorporating the interests of the global with
those of the local, and those of the future with those of the present.
This seems to suggest, perhaps paradoxically, that the democracies of
the Anthropocene will have to be more democratic in some respects and
less democratic in others. The relation between popular sovereignty and
institutions that limit popular sovereignty while respecting it is a
tug-of-war in democratic theory and practice that has been going on for
millennia, and is now being put to unprecedented tests.

Liberal democracies, in particular, have an enormous amount at stake.
Liberal political theory has always recognized the right to resist and
even overthrow illegitimate political power.290 This right has been used
to justify historical events that liberals typically applaud, including
the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, and the American
Revolution.291 Despite their failures and excesses, these revolutions
forwarded liberal values and helped to entrench them in institutions.
Unable to find consistent responses to challenges to their own
legitimacy in the Anthropocene, liberal democracies may be in danger of
warranting revolutions against themselves and the very institutions that
should realize their values. They may become the ancient regime.

### AT: Terror !

[The likelihood that anyone **outside a war zone**]{.underline} [will be
killed by an]{.underline} Islamist [extremist terrorist is **extremely
small**. In the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, for example, [some]{.underline} **[six
people]{.underline}** [have perished each year since 9/11 at the hands
of such [terrorists]{.mark}---for an annual fatality rate of about **one
in 50 million**]{.underline} for the period.

This might be taken to suggest, as one writer has characterized it, that
"terrorism is such a minor threat to American life and limb that
[[it's]{.mark} simply **bizarre**---just **[stupefyingly irrational and
intellectually unserious]{.mark}**---to suppose that it could even
**begin** to justify]{.underline} the abolition of privacy rights as
they have been traditionally understood in favour of the installation of
a panoptic [surveillance]{.underline} state." 1 And [terrorism
**specialist**]{.underline} Marc Sageman [characterizes [the
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} terrorists present in the United States
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} "rather
**[[negligible]{.underline}]{.mark}**." 2 The vast majority of what is
commonly tallied as [terrorism]{.underline} has occurred **[in war
zones]{.underline}**, and this is especially true for fatalities.3 But
**[even]{.underline}** this [[has been
**exaggerated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by [conflating
**terror**]{.mark}ism [with **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}: civil war
violence that would previously have been seen to be acts of insurgency
are now often labeled terrorism.4

In order to put the numbers in some context, it has often been pointed
out that **[[far more]{.mark} Americans [are killed]{.mark} each
year]{.underline}** [not only by such]{.underline} highly
**[destructive]{.underline}** [hazards as **drug**]{.underline}
overdose**[s]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[automobile]{.underline}** accident**[s]{.underline}**, [but even
by]{.underline} such comparatively **[minor]{.underline}**
[ones]{.underline} as lightning, accident-causing
**[deer]{.underline}**, **[peanut]{.underline}** allergie[**s**, or
**[drowning in bathtubs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some comparisons are
arrayed in Table 1.

In recent years, however, critics have attacked what they call "the
bathtub fallacy." 5

First, they stress that it is important to keep in mind that bathtubs
are not out to kill you while terrorism is a willful act carried out by
diabolical, dedicated, and clever human beings. Thus, although the
number of people Islamist terrorists have been able to kill in the West
since 9/11 has thus far been quite limited, those terrorists, as they
plot and plan and learn from experience, may very well become far more
destructive in the future.

Second, the critics charge that the comparison of terrorism with bathtub
drownings is incomplete in that it doesn't consider the possibility that
the incidence of terrorist destruction is low precisely because
counterterrorism measures are so effective.

Third, it is argued that, unlike bathtub drownings, terrorism exacts
costs far beyond those entailed in the event itself. It damagingly sows
terror, fear, and anxiety; disturbs our

psychological well-being; undermines trust and openness within the
society; and reduces our sense of intrinsic moral worth even as it
increases a sense of helplessness. They maintain, fourth, that the
comparison is invalid because, unlike terrorism, bathtubs provide
benefit.

And finally, they contend that terrorism costs are peculiarly high,
particularly in a democratic society, because the fears it generates
will necessarily need to be serviced by policy makers, and this pressure
forces, or inspires, them to adopt countermeasures, both foreign and
domestic, that are costly and sometimes even excessive.

In this article, we examine these five propositions and find all of them
to be wanting. In the process, we conclude that terrorism is rare
outside war zones because, to a substantial degree, terrorists don't
exist there. In general, as with rare diseases that kill few, it makes
more policy sense to expend limited funds on hazards that inflict far
more damage.

Terrorism is willed and may well become more destructive

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg has suggested that "the fear of terrorism
isn't motivated solely by what terrorists have done, but what terrorists
hope to do." Bathtubs are simply not "engaged in a conspiracy with other
bathtubs to murder ever-larger numbers of Americans." However,
terrorists "in the Islamist orbit," he insists, "seek unconventional
weapons that would allow them to kill a far-larger number of Americans
than died on Sept. 11." 6 Or as Janan Ganesh of the Financial Times puts
it, "Bathroom deaths could multiply by 50 without a threat to civil
order. The incidence of terror could not." 7

Thus far, [9/11 stands out as an **extreme outlier**: scarcely any
terrorist act, before or after, in war zones or outside them, has
inflicted **even one-tenth**]{.underline} [as much]{.underline} total
[destruction]{.underline}. That is, contrary to common expectations,
[the attack has]{.underline} thus far [been an]{.underline}
[**aberration**, **not** a **harbinger**]{.underline}.8 And
[**[a]{.mark}**l-**[Q]{.mark}**aeda central]{.underline}, the group
responsible for the attack, [has]{.underline}, in some respects at
least, [[proved]{.mark} to resemble]{.underline} President John
Kennedy's assassin, [**Lee Harvey Oswald**---an entity
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[trivial proportions]{.underline}**
[that got]{.underline}]{.mark} **[horribly [lucky
once]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The tiny group of perhaps 100 or so does
appear to have served as something of an inspiration to some Muslim
extremists. They may have done some training, may have contributed a bit
to the Taliban's far larger insurgency in Afghanistan, and may have
participated in a few terrorist acts in Pakistan. In his examination of
the major terrorist plots against the West since 9/11, Mitchell Silber
finds only two---the shoe bomber attempt of 2001 and the effort to blow
up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs in 2006---that could be
said to be under the "command and control" of al-Qaeda central (as
opposed to ones suggested, endorsed, or inspired by the organization),
and there are questions about how full its control was even in these two
instances, both of which, as it happens, failed miserably.9 And,
although some al-Qaeda affiliates have committed substantial damage in
the Middle East, usually in the context of civil wars, their efforts to
carry out terrorism in the West have been rare and completely
ineffective.10 Even under siege, it is difficult to see why al-Qaeda
could not have carried out attacks at least as costly and shocking as
the shooting rampages (organized by other groups) that took place in
Mumbai in 2008 or at a shopping center in Kenya in 2013. Neither took
huge resources, presented major logistical challenges, required the
organization of a large number of perpetrators, or needed extensive
planning.

However, [there is of course no guarantee that things will
**remain**]{.underline} [that way, and the 9/11 attacks inspired the
remarkable **extrapolation**]{.underline} [that, because the
[terrorists]{.mark} were **successful with box cutters**, they might
**soon** be [able to **turn**]{.mark} **out weapons of mass
destruction**--- particularly **[nuclear]{.mark}**]{.underline}
ones---and then detonate them in an American city. For example, in his
influential 2004 book, Nuclear Terrorism, Harvard's Graham
**[Allison]{.underline}** [relayed]{.underline} his "considered
judgment" [that]{.underline} "on the current path, [a nuclear terrorist
attack on America in the **decade**]{.underline} ahead [is]{.underline}
more **[likely]{.underline}** than not." 11 Allison has had a great deal
of company in his alarming pronouncements. In 2007, the distinguished
physicist Richard Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an
American or European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per
year, which would work out to 91 percent over the elevenyear period to
2018.12

**[Allison's time is up]{.underline}**, and so is Garwin's.
[These]{.underline} oft-repeated [[warnings have
proven]{.underline}]{.mark} to be **[[empty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And
it is important to point out that [[not only]{.mark} have terrorists
**[failed]{.mark}** to go nuclear, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} as William
Langewiesche, who has assessed the process in detail, put it in 2007,
"[[The **best info**]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark} that **[no one has
gotten]{.mark} anywhere [near]{.mark}**]{.underline} this. I mean, if
you look carefully and practically at this process, you see that [[it
is]{.mark} an **enormous undertaking**]{.underline} [[full of
**risks**]{.mark} for]{.underline} the would-be
[terrorists]{.underline}." 13 [That process [requires trusting
**corrupt**]{.mark}ed foreign [**collaborators**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[**criminals**, obtaining]{.mark} and
transporting highly]{.underline} [[**guarded material**, setting
up]{.mark} a machine shop staffed with **[top
scientists]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technicians]{.underline}**, [[and **rolling**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[heavy]{.underline}**, cumbersome, and
**[[untested]{.underline}]{.mark}** finished
**[[product]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into]{.underline}
**[position]{.underline}** [to be detonated [by a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[skilled crew]{.underline}**]{.mark}, all the [while [attracting **no
attention**]{.mark}]{.underline} from outsiders.

[[Nor]{.mark} have terrorist groups been [able to steal]{.mark} existing
nuclear]{.underline} [[weapons]{.mark}---characteristically burdened
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[multiple [safety
devices]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} often [stored
in]{.underline} pieces at separate **[secure
locales]{.underline}**---from existing arsenals as was once much feared.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} [they certainly have [not]{.mark} been able
to [cajole]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[leaders]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
nuclear states [[to]{.underline} **[palm one off]{.underline}**]{.mark}
to them---though a war inflicting more death than Hiroshima and Nagasaki
combined was launched against Iraq in 2003 in major part under the spell
of fantasies about such a handover.14

More generally, [the **actual [terrorist]{.mark}**]{.underline}
"adversarie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in the **West**]{.underline}
**[scarcely]{.underline}** [deserve accolades for either **dedication**
or **prowess**]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that sometimes even
incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are
rare. [For the most part, terrorists in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[are a
**confused**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[inadequate]{.underline}**,
**[[incompetent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[blundering]{.underline}**,
and **[gullible [bunch]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [only]{.underline}
**[occasionally]{.underline}** [able to get their act together. Most
seem to be far [better at **frenetic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and often
**[self-deluded [scheming]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} at [actual
**[execution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A summary assessment by RAND's
Brian Jenkins is apt: "[their **numbers** remain **small**, their
**determination limp**, and their **competence poor**]{.underline}." 15
And much [the same holds for **Europe**]{.underline} [and the
**rest**]{.underline} [of the developed world]{.underline}.16 Also
working against terrorist success in the West is the fact that [almost
**[all]{.mark}** are **[amateurs]{.mark}**: they have never before tried
to do something like this. Unlike **criminals** they have **not been
able to develop street smarts**.]{.underline}

[Except perhaps for the use of vehicles to [deliver]{.mark}
mayhem]{.underline} (though this idea is by no means new in the history
of terrorism), [there has been]{.underline} remarkably **[[little
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terrorist weaponry or methodology
since 9/11]{.underline}.17 Like their predecessors, [they have continued
to rely on bombs]{.underline} (many of which fail to detonate or do much
damage) [and bullets]{.underline}.18

Cautions and Caveats

It is important to note that [scientific advances and]{.underline} the
[**emergence** of **new tech**nologies are **not** the only, or even the
**most important**, factors **influencing** the [**likelihood** of
**terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}** acquiring and **[using CBRN
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thankfully, the [[number of]{.mark}
terrorist [groups]{.mark} motivated to acquire these weapons [has been
limited, despite]{.mark} [many that have]{.mark}]{.underline} the
requisite [technical and financial [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.60
The [**[vast majority]{.mark}** of **terrorist** groups have been
[**satisfied** with **conventional**]{.mark} **weapons**]{.underline}
such as guns and bombs. The surprising rise of the Islamic State and
their repeated use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria, however, serve
as a reminder that it only takes one group with the intent and
capability to acquire and use CBRN weapons to pose a threat to
international security.61

In addition, the [[ability]{.mark} of a terrorist group to convert
CBRN-related material into a weapon [depends on]{.mark}]{.underline}
intangible factors such as **[[tacit knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(the unarticulated knowledge that can only be gained through hands-on,
trial-and-error experience or mentorship), the [**ability** of the group
to **create and share** such **knowledge**, [and its ability to
**assemble**]{.mark} and successfully **manage** **interdisciplinary
teams**]{.underline}.62 [Terrorist [groups]{.mark}, especially those
**facing pressure** from **law enforcement** and **intel**ligence
agencies, [have had **difficulties** **recruiting**]{.mark},
**retaining**, [and]{.mark} effectively [**utilizing** individuals
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [right **combination** of **scientific**,
**technical**, and **organizational [skills]{.mark}** to develop
effective CBRN weapons]{.underline}.

[Developing a CBRN weapon capable of]{.underline} causing [**mass
casualties** is also a **very complex** process. A scientific
[breakthrough that makes]{.mark} **developing** or acquiring **[one
component]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a weapon [[easier]{.mark} might [not
have any impact on]{.mark} the [other stages]{.mark} in the
weaponization process]{.underline}. Thus, the [impact of a single
scientific breakthrough]{.underline} or a novel technology on the
acquisition of a CBRN weapon [should not be exaggerated]{.underline}.
For example, [**[syn]{.mark}**thetic **[bio]{.mark}**logy might make it
easier]{.underline} for a non-state actor [to create]{.underline} a
pathogen, [but]{.underline} that technology [**[does not help]{.mark}**
terrorists improve their **[ability to disseminate]{.mark}** the
pathogen on a large scale]{.underline}.63

Likewise, it is important to assess the [specific contributions that a
particular technology can make to a specific aspect of]{.underline} the
[CBRN threat in practice, not just in theory]{.underline}. In the case
of [[3D printing]{.underline}]{.mark}, this manufacturing technology [is
**[not appropriate]{.mark}** for working with **[metals]{.mark}** that
[are **toxic** or **radioactive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
microreactors are well-suited to covertly producing small quantities of
highly pure chemicals, [they are **not well-suited** to]{.underline} the
[production of **most chemical warfare agents**]{.underline} and
precursors [due to **[excessive heat]{.mark}** generated]{.underline} by
their synthesis [[and]{.mark} by the **production** of **[solid
byproducts]{.mark}** that would **[clog]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[microfluidic [channels]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the heart of this
technology.64

Finally, [[advances in]{.mark} science and **[tech]{.mark}**nology
represent]{.underline} not just threats, but also [opportunities to
[make it harder]{.mark} for terrorist groups [to acquire]{.mark} CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nmanned
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial and ground
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [can be
[used for border security]{.mark}, CBRN weapon [detection, and]{.mark}
bomb [disposal]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the EU is sponsoring
the development of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to investigate
CBRN crime scenes under the ROCSAFE project.65 [[Biometrics]{.mark} and
radio frequency ID chips can be used to [improve **physical
security**]{.mark} **measures** and **inventory control** to prevent
unauthorized access to CBRN materials]{.underline}. Advances in science
and technology are also leading to **[improved
[sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [can be used to [detect]{.mark} the
**[production]{.mark}**, **transportation**, and **use** of CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. The [development of dedicated laboratories and new
techniques to analyze CBRN materials has also contributed to impressive
advances in nuclear, biological, and chemical forensics, which are
crucial for attribution]{.underline}.66

/GoGreen!

Can the U.S. Department of Defense do two things at once: Operate in the
gray zone and excel in great power competition? Not according to Tommy
Ross and Stephen Tankel who [**[argue]{.mark}** that **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[a]{.mark}ssistance** "[is]{.mark} focused [on the **wrong countries**
and]{.mark} being used to build the **wrong
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Their idea is [that competition
with China and Russia - **great power competition**]{.underline} (GPC) -
[is the priority and all instruments of national power must be bent to
that end, at the expense of all other needs]{.underline}. Ross and
Tankel conclude that the "United States is no longer well-positioned to
use security sector assistance to "compete with China and Russia ---
especially in 'gray zone' activities short of war." Ross is a former
assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation and should know
better.

Changes in administrations are [an opportunity to **[reflect on what
works and]{.mark} what [doesn't]{.mark}**[, **but**]{.mark} in this
case, **[changes]{.mark}** in the name of so-called reform [could
**cause real harm**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They suggest, in part,
converting what are known as building partner capacity (BPC) funds into
general-purpose security assistance funds so they may explicitly be used
for Great Power Competition --- that is, to block China and Russia. That
is a fine goal, but there are greater and more effective tools already
in use. Security assistance writ large, about \$19 billion dollars in
2019, and the deterrent effect of the U.S. armed forces being forward
stationed and deployed around the world. Besides, Congress created
specific categories of activities in for BPC which lie in the gray zone
like counter terrorism operations, countering illicit drug trafficking,
countering organized crime, supporting intelligence operations and
supporting multi-national operations- like AMISOM in Somalia and the G5
Sahel. These funds are critical in providing equipment and training
support against various insurgent, transnational terrorists and
smuggling threats in twenty-one countries.
**[[Moving]{.underline}]{.mark}** those **[[funds]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from these conflicts [[to support **great-power competition**]{.mark}
would result in the **[abandon]{.mark}ment** of those [partners]{.mark}
who are [now]{.mark} decisively [engaged]{.mark} on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' behalf. [There is **real
danger** to a U.S. withdrawal of support to these fragile
partners]{.underline}.

What are building partner capacity funds? They are a basket of
congressional authorizations meant to counter urgent and emergent
threats. In various forms, they have been around for three
administrations. In the early 2000s, the DOD needed an authorization to
quickly buttress and fund operations with smaller countries not in
formal alliances like NATO or through the cumbersome existing security
assistance framework of foreign military financing and sales. The
zeitgeist of BPC funds was to quickly provide rifles, trucks, radios,
and ammunition, along with training, to partner states who were fighting
terrorists and insurgencies that were critical to U.S. security. These
funds were meant for partner states actually engaged in the business of
killing bad guys. Beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, which gobbled up billions
of dollars, building partner capacity funds have been small. BPC funds
have gone through several iterations since their introduction in 2006.
The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act re-authorized the largest
part of the funds under section 333. They have never exceeded 1 percent
of the DOD budget. In 2020, 333 Global Train and Equip fund, made up
less than 0.14% of the defense budget.

Where have 333 funds been used? Since 2017, they have been used in
Burkina Faso, Chad, Cameroon, supporting Uganda, Kenya, and Djibouti in
the UN mission in Somalia. Worldwide, they have been used in the
Philippines, Vietnam, Jordan, Uzbekistan and even Mexico. Earlier
versions of BPC funds were used in Hungary, Indonesia, Georgia, Latvia,
Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Poland and
Romania. In Africa in particular, the need is urgent. That is exactly
where these funds should be deployed to allow the rest of the billions
and billions of dollars of security assistance to be spent more directly
against China and Russia in.

A Holding Action

First and foremost, building partner capacity is a holding action, a
strategic defensive effort in order that the United States and its
Allies can deter Russia and China with infantry divisions, fighter jets
and aircraft carriers in other theaters. Building partner capacity (BPC)
funds are not meant to be decisive. They buy time against the violence
and instability of the gray zone. That zone is where malign actors
create chaos and seek to replace legitimate authority in its wake. On
one side is the area the U.S. and the international community can
access, and on the other, are the forces that seek to confront the U.S.
In Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, attacks by Islamic State and al Qaeda
affiliates have increased dramatically since 2015, with more than 4000
deaths reported in 2019. The U.S. must stay engaged in that gray zone.
This is the penultimate problem with the assertion that security
assistance is out of sync with U.S. priorities and these "shortcomings
hinder U.S. allies and partners, in turn leaving them vulnerable to
Chinese and Russian influence" that reveals a deep misunderstanding of
the strategy behind BPC funds. BPC funds are exactly how the U.S.
remains engaged in competition with Russia and China in the gray zone.

[A withdrawal of BPC funds or **redirection** in their uses would be
**tantamount to abandonment** of the ideals of building up
partners]{.underline}. [The Department of Defense could **[just find
itself in a deeper hole]{.mark} ten [years hence]{.mark}**, anxiously
**[requesting]{.mark} another [funding]{.mark} stream [to counter the
same, bigger]{.mark}, more dangerous [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
That is on the horizon: For example, Burkina Faso is the focal point of
an increasingly complex regional war in which jihadist groups take
advantage of nonexistent border security. This in turn has exacerbated
and amplified local grievances about corruption and bad governance. An
attack killed 36 in a village market in January 2020, and in October,
another 20 were killed in the north of the country. The violence moves
across international borders with impunity. This is typical of the vast
trans-Sahel region in which the reach of the central state governments
closely follows the roads and towns, with millions of square kilometers
of scrub and desert left with only the lightest touch of government
authority. In 2012, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad
in Mali teamed up with heavily armed Toureg nomads back from the Libyan
Civil war. The group captured key cities and declared northern Mali an
Islamic state. The short, sharp civil war toppled the Malian president
in a coup in March 2012, resulting in the French Government deploying
4,000 soldiers to push back the Islamist groups. In August 2020, another
coup toppled the latest leader of Mali. Building partner capacity funds
are used in each country for air reconnaissance assets, long range
communications, and heavy-duty desert vehicles, along with training on
how to tie them all together in operations. This contributes to
partner's internal stability, thus keeping them in the fold of
international norms and values, and more resistant to Chinese and
Russian influence.

China and Russia behind the Gray Zone

If the U.S. pulls back from these areas of conflict, China and Russia
will step in. In many cases, it is because of the security situation and
corruption that U.S. companies hesitate to operate. For China and
Russia, concerns over human rights abuses matter little. Chinese
investment in Africa tops \$200 billion per year and since 2015, Beijing
has provided \$120 billion in financial aid. In Burkina Faso, China is
building a \$140 million hospital and a \$1.3 billion dollar road. In
Guinea, another west African country, China has provided \$20 billion in
loans to develop bauxite mines and another \$14 billion for iron
developments. In Mali, the Chinese have invested \$11 billion in
infrastructure deals.

It is true that many of these failing states are run by corrupt,
narcissistic family and clan confederations whose human rights records
are little better than the insurgent terrorists who seek to replace
them. Security assistance funds provide an important foot in the door
for the U.S. in these developing nations. It is particularly important
because these weak countries view many of the U.S. State Department's
activities as subversive and possibly corrosive to their own authority.
Building partner capacity (BPC) funds are security funds and that is
simple enough to understand. If this 'foot-in-the-door' is removed,
Chinese dollars will work just as well, their thinking goes. If the U.S.
were to retreat along the line presented by Ross and Tankel, the line of
instability would move, allowing the space behind to be filled by Russia
and particularly, China. The places where Chinese money is invested
would need security and already China has peacekeepers in Congo,
Liberia, Mali, Sudan and South Sudan. China also partially funds the G5
Sahel Joint Force.

Perhaps more baldly, and thus more surprising that Ross and Tankel
missed it, these small countries vote in the big international
organizations, like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.
These potential allies will be needed in the coalitions of international
cooperation that President Joe Biden looks to lead. Thwarting Russia and
China short of actual war will require a broad coalition of countries
voting on issues ranging from climate change to fair trade. Already,
China uses dollar diplomacy to keep vulnerable, weak states in its
orbit. It won over Burkina Faso in 2019, at the same time China offered
to pay for security forces in the Sahel. BPC funds, for all their
simplicity, can help buy votes, too.

The Last 1%?

Great power competition is real and is the priority of the Department of
Defense. Ross and Tankel are correct in that. However, they lose sight
of the billions and billions spent on great power competition. Since it
is the priority, one could say that great-power competition consumes 99%
of the Department of Defense budget. That is tanks, aircraft carriers,
attack helicopters and missiles. That is personnel and their pay and
benefits. That is all the training and exercises in the plains of
central Europe and the seas in Southeast Asia. The U.S ability to
curtail Chinese and Russian expansion in the gray zone is enormously
important. Why would the last 1% be eyed for use in Europe and Northeast
Asia?

It is because the bureaucracy simply cannot imagine low-level conflict
as a useful means to a larger end. Slow to adapt, grinding, and loath to
change, the Department of Defense was created for great power war and it
requires expensive kit- missile defense, ships, tanks and fighter jets
like the trillion dollar F35 and B21 programs, and the Gerald Ford
aircraft carrier. Security assistance, run through the State Department,
and the even bigger foreign military sales efforts have provided this
kind of equipment since the 1960s. There is seduction in the simplicity
of big wars. They are easy to understand, plan for, and win. From
pre-commissioning training to the flag officer level, planning is
oriented toward maneuvering divisions, corps and carrier air wings, the
gotterdammerung of the decisive battle (a horrible misapplication of
Clausewitz). This is the American way of war, with technology, mass, and
speed. [Unfortunately, [this creates]{.mark}]{.underline} an amaranthine
loop of organizational bias and [**[coercive info]{.mark}rmation
[processing routines]{.mark}** that in turn produce values and norms
about the way things are and the way things should be]{.underline}. BPC
funds are meant for smaller, simpler tasks, not part of the U.S. main
effort in its big wars. After 9/11 the Department of Defense needed a
tool for engagement- thus the creation of these types of funds. Planning
and execution have proceeded apace since. Ross and Tankel have also
taken to task the planning superstructure for these funds. Their
suggestion of creating "coordinated, department-wide planning processes
at the departments of State and Defense" is also wide of the mark.
[There is already a joint review and approval process that begins
eighteen to twenty-four months out from execution. There is even a
capstone review conference called the Joint Security Sector Assistance
Review that seeks to capture issues and recommendations for improvement
in future execution cycles. **[Creating new]{.mark}**]{.underline} human
infrastructure, [boards, bureaus, cells, and [**diagrams** would
**invite more** of the very "**inefficient and incoherent
planning**]{.mark} **and coordination [processes]{.mark}**["
that]{.mark}]{.underline} Ross and Tankel [[seek to
improve]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Considering the price point and investment level of BPC funds, they have
been successful. They have paid for support to the AMISOM peacekeeping
mission in Somalia and strengthened the Jordanian efforts against ISIS
and Al Qaeda. They proved instrumental in providing real capabilities in
Tunisia's struggle against trans-national violence spilling over from
Libya. The 333 funds, and other, even smaller building partner capacity
authorizations have made a difference in these places where the average
cost per capacity building program is just \$5.5 million. There does
exist the dubious idea is that these small funds could be deployed
quickly to support and guide partners towards larger, and much more
lucrative purchases of military equipment. This destroys the original
intent of 333 funds. Congress has seen the importance of having separate
authorities to do separate things, and this should be preserved. If BPC
funds are amalgamated into the framework that provides big weapons and
expensive capabilities, like fighter-jets, hyper-advanced, secure
communications, and cyber security apparatus, it will take away, in some
cases, the only incentive for partners to meet and fight terrorists. The
knock-on effect is losing a strong method for deterring method of
deterring Chinese and Russian aspirations in these gray zones.

Conclusion

[[Overall]{.mark}, the U.S. [spends]{.mark} about **\$[18 billion
globally]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} various **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[a]{.mark}ssistance** authorizations. The question that appears not to
be asked in wise councils is \"**[Would this tiny .14% make a difference
in great power competition?]{.mark}**\" [**Already**, the **vast
majority**]{.mark} of **security assistance** funding **does go towards
great power competition** via foreign military financing and
sales]{.underline}. Other initiatives are not small. The European
Deterrence Initiative focused on Russia sits at \$6 billion, the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative, provides \$250 million, the Southeast
Asia Maritime Security Initiative is funded at \$425 million. Congress
is set to authorize the Pacific Deterrence Initiative with has much as
\$6 billion over two years. Now, the bureaucracy wants the .14 percent
of the budget meant to fight terrorism around the world.

Finally, [the U.S. [pays]{.mark} **\$[700 billion]{.mark}** a year [for
the **world's largest defense establishment**]{.mark} on the premise
that this **massive juggernaut** is **needed [for deterrence]{.mark}**.
In this case, [it **doesn't make sense** that **another \$700 million
will make a difference**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The very idea is
staggering: Is there no deterrent effect in all those divisions and
aircraft carriers? There is, however, a very real deterrent in
strengthening small partners quickly and effectively. [The
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense **can walk and chew gum** at the same
time]{.underline}. At least Congress thinks so, hence the categories
legislated in the building partner capacity authorization. The U.S. will
not send infantry divisions to west Africa; it can and should support
governments in improving their own security. [The DOD can confront
China, Russia and provide capacity support to friends in the
fight]{.underline}. For less than a billion dollars a year, the decision
is a no-brainer.

[Within the **international development** arena, the past few years has
witnessed a move towards measured, progress-focused development, as
illustrated by the birth of terms such as "effective aid " and "managing
for development results " at various international forums]{.underline}.
For example, at a global meeting of development partners in 2004, , the
discussions centred on how to strengthen an international partnership
around the concept of 'managing for development results'. [This upped
the stakes for **monitoring and evaluation** (**M&E**)]{.underline}, in
the sense that the Joint Memorandum, which was issued by all these
global partners at the end of their meeting, focused not only on M&E
processes itself, but also on using results for improvement and
decision-making.

"\[We will\] rely on -- and strengthen -- countries' monitoring and
evaluation systems to track progress and assess outcomes. As agencies
with regional or global reach, we pledge to better distill the lessons
of countries' experiences and disseminate knowledge about what gets
results in different country contexts."

Joint Memorandum, issued by all global development partners at the end
of the 2nd Roundtable on Managing for Development Results

[**[Despite pressure]{.mark}** from international development partners
to measure and quantify results, [**M&E** has **remained the ugly
duckling** of **development**. **Efforts to incorporate it into
practice** have met with a combination of **apathy**, **resistance**,
and **half-baked efforts**]{.mark} that primarily consisted of
**[throwing together a few indicators]{.mark}** and defining how the
data would be collected]{.underline}.

[Developments in the field of **HIV/AIDS** monitoring and evaluation
over the last 10 years [has illustrated the challenges of]{.mark}
monitoring and evaluating of **development efforts in general**, and
raised some uncomfortable, close-to-home questions for the development
**[M&E]{.mark}** profession]{.underline}.

In Africa in particular, HIV/AIDS M&E is not only important because of
international pressure on managing for development results, but also
because of the scale of the virus's impact. HIV/AIDS has ravaged Africa.
A continent-wide Social Impact Assessment would have revealed that it
has destroyed families, torn apart communities, paralysed the health
sector, crippled the agricultural and education sectors, hampered
government's efforts to provide effective services to its people, and
caused indescribable long-term trauma and grief. The extent and reach of
its impact over such a short period of time is forcing national AIDS
coordinating structures to focus, maybe for the first time, on ways to
find real, effective, efficient, and replicable solutions.

At the international level and at the country level, the response to
HIV/AIDS has moved in the past 10 years from a health sector-driven to a
multisectoral response. In parallel, HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation
has evolved from exclusively epidemiological surveillance in the 1980s
to multi discipline approaches to HIV/AIDS M&E.

B What are the challenges?

HIV/AIDS M&E cannot be a disjointed collection of evaluation studies and
monitoring processes, but needs one integrated HIV/AIDS M&E system,
managed by a National AIDS Commission (NAC) MG comment: some countries
do not have NACs, so it may be better to refer to it as the national
AIDS coordinating structures. This is because the NAC has the mandate to
coordinate and manage the national HIV response and can only do this if
it has accurate and relevant data when decisions need to be made. It is
also because it was recently acknowledged, internationally, that one M&E
framework at country level is one of the core principles of effective
management of the HIV response .

Such an HIV/AIDS M&E system needs to combine a vast variety of M&E
processes: from biological sentinel surveillance (an epidemiological
"tripwire" used to detect trends in HIV infection); to routine
collection of management information about funding for HIV interventions
in the public sector, private sector and civil society; and
ethnographic-type studies about sexual risk behaviour and the abuse of
right of vulnerable children, the elderly and persons living with AIDS.

HIV/AIDS M&E requires that, in order to assess the extent and nature of
HIV service coverage, the same output-level, programme-monitoring data
be collected from all implementers of HIV interventions on a routine
basis. The health sector in Africa has struggled to establish an
effective management information system in its own sector -- NACs are
now obliged to set up a such a routine system across all government
ministries, the private sector, and the entire civil society. This is a
vast undertaking, especially given that some of these organisations have
never had to report to government before. Another challenge is that the
HIV response is increasingly becoming decentralised. This adds a layer
of reporting and could potentially cause delays in data collection.

HIV interventions range dramatically in content, focus, and
implementation methodology. For example, interventions focusing on
establishing partnerships for HIV will have vastly different monitoring
and evaluation approaches to programmes that aim to keep educationally
marginalised children in school.

The impact of HIV has necessitated that there is a real focus on using
results for decision-making and programme improvement because countries
in Africa heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS cannot afford not to.

B What can be done?

Addressing these challenges requires a systemic approach: we need to
focus on designing and operationalising national HIV/AIDS M&E systems,
rather than new evaluation studies.

Figure 1 illustrates such a systemic approach to HIV/AIDS M&E. It shows
the relationship between indicators (A), data sources (B), information
products (C) and the project stakeholders (D). These four components
will only work in unison if it is backed up by strong management.

Figure 1: Illustration of Systemic Approach to HIV/AIDS M&E

At the risk of revamping an old development phrase, a systemic approach
to HIV/AIDS M&E require those involved in the M&E profession to change.
It requires a paradigm shift away from conducting piecemeal,
complicated, and specialised monitoring or evaluation studies and
towards thinking about monitoring and evaluation in an operational way,
focusing on synergies, sometimes at the expense of individual academic
accolades.

B The Way Forward

Such an approach requires that M&E professionals:

•Learn new skills: they need to become good budgeters, M&E work plan
developers and M&E strategists.

•Move away from focusing on specific processes and towards integrated
monitoring and evaluation systems, which re-examines the practicalities
of collecting output data.

•Use existing tools in a new way: For example, Social Impact Assessments
have, to date, primarily been used to assess the impact of planned
developments (e.g. assessing the social impact of a new mine on a
community's livelihood). The tools in the quiver of the Social Impact
Assessment process (including trend extensions, computer modelling,
consulting experts, focus group discussion and questionnaires) could be
adapted to even suit assessments of the unplanned, catalytic, and
widespread impact of HIV and AIDS on different sectors of society.

•Assess the cost-benefit trade-off in different monitoring and
evaluation tools and processes to find, recommend, and use those
processes that are most useful for the most reasonable cost

•Be prepared to sacrifice some professional autonomy for the sake of
synchronisation. In one country in Africa, in 2004, over 40 assessments
relating to HIV/AIDS M&E were done, often replicating each other.

•Understand how HIV/AIDS M&E systems should be managed to yield the best
possible success; it implies advocacy for M&E, capacity building in M&E
and communications about M&E

•Find a renewed focus to make sure that results are used to improve
projects.

•Go back to the basics of data collection, and apply it with new vigour
in a multi-sectoral, decentralised, developing and emergency context.

•Think of practical ways in which to focus on, promote and
institutionalise the process of using results for decision-making. This
means moving away from the typical thinking in which M&E systems have
focused on indicators and data sources, with less focus on information
products and dissemination to stakeholders (see Figure 2). It also
implies avoiding a situation where stakeholder dissemination is done as
an afterthought, primarily through a national level workshop.

Figure 2: Disproportionate focus on Indicators and Data Sources

The challenges of HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation systems cut to the
heart of the monitoring and evaluation profession. Although we have
always known that monitoring and evaluation needs to earn its keep
(Patton, 2000), it is nowhere more evident than in the design and
implementation of HIV/AIDS M&E systems. **[[Every dollar that is spent
on monitoring and evaluation is one that it not spent
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** HIV **[[programme
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Within the context of HIV/AIDS,
[[this **can**]{.mark} **simply [not be wasted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

HIVAIDS is an opportunity for our profession to prove M&E as a real,
tangible and value adding part of development work, and as an
opportunity for professionals to demystify monitoring and evaluation. We
have a responsibility to do so, and there has never been a better time.

#### Even if it works, results [won't be used]{.underline} effectively

We don't need to preach to the choir: given the plethora of data-related
projects that donors and development finance institutions (DFIs) have
supported in the past, they clearly know that data is a powerful tool
for advancing financial inclusion. And there is a lot to be excited
about, given how digital technologies are accelerating the speed, depth
and breadth of available data.

We share this excitement. In fact, data is at the heart of CGAP's work.
In recent years, we have talked about data-based segmentation to better
serve customers, data sharing to enable innovation, data protection and
how data capabilities need to be revamped to implement risk-based
supervision.

But is data just the latest shiny object of the financial inclusion
community? Are data's powers fully leveraged? Does more data lead to
sustainable impact?

Today, we think the jury is out on all three of these questions. [Our
[**research** shows]{.mark} that [**more and better data** in the hands
of]{.mark} providers, regulators, **[policy makers]{.mark}**, investors
and customers **[doesn't automatically lead to better
outcomes]{.mark}**. Results **[often]{.mark}** show that these market
actors [**do not use data** or]{.mark} have **[stopped]{.mark} using
data [after a while]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That's why, for us, the real excitement lies beyond data. It is about
bringing fresh thinking to help donors and DFIs achieve sustainable
impact through their data efforts. Based on our research, we have four
recommendations:

[[**Do not overestimate data** as a **driver of change**]{.mark}.
**[Increased knowledge]{.mark}** with data [does **not**]{.mark}
necessarily [incentivize **behavior change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, robust data on women\'s demand and need for financial services
will not automatically lead providers to improve their suite of products
and services. A detailed theory of change (ToC) will help donors and
DFIs to clarify the chain of incentives and behavior changes that a data
initiative seeks to trigger. Make sure the pathway from data to expected
outcomes is clear.

### Thumper -- Ukraine

#### [Ukraine thumps]{.underline} -- and more [unexpected]{.underline} arms increases are coming

**Ryan 6-14**-22 Missy Ryan, reports on diplomacy, national security and
the State Department for The Washington Post; and Emily Rauhala,
Brussels bureau chief for The Washington Post, covering the European
Union and NATO; "Ukraine battle intensifies as Western backers mull new
military aid," The Washington Post, 6-14-2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/14/severodonetsk-weapons-nato-russian-advance/>
/GoGreen!

Russia intensified its assault on a strategic Ukrainian city on Tuesday
as [**[NATO]{.mark}** officials]{.underline} prepared to [debate
**[increased military support]{.mark}** for Kyiv's attempt to reverse
Russian momentum]{.underline} in the country's east.

Officials in the eastern city of Severodonetsk said that Ukrainian
forces were mounting a pitched defense of an area that is now a central
focus of Russian firepower. Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk described "constant
fighting" for Severodonetsk, which has become increasingly isolated
following the destruction of bridges leading out of the city. He said
Russian troops so far have been unable to complete their control of the
area.

"Street fighting is underway," Stryuk said. "Tactically, our armed
forces are pushing back the enemy," an effort that he said relies on a
"huge amount of manpower."

Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region where Severodonetsk is
located, said that humanitarian supplies could no longer be delivered to
the city. The two sides have exchanged accusations about who is
responsible for destroying the bridges, which permit the movement of
civilians and aid but also military equipment and troops.

Capturing Severodonetsk and neighboring Lysychansk, which lies across
the Siversky Donets river, would represent a major step forward in
President Vladimir Putin's quest to solidify control of eastern Ukraine,
and would mark a Russian revival following the battlefield failures that
characterized the early stage of the war.

Even as Ukrainian forces face mounting setbacks in the Donbas campaign,
officials in Kyiv have vowed to retake every inch of Russian-controlled
territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, but they say
greater outside help is required.

Haidai said conditions for civilians remaining in Severodonesk are now
"extremely difficult." In echoes of the extended siege of the southern
city of Mariupol, officials have said that some 500 people, including
dozens of children, are sheltering in bunkers beneath the city's Azot
chemical plant.

On Tuesday, a top Russian military official offered a humanitarian
corridor to permit the evacuation of civilians trapped at the plant. In
a statement, Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said the evacuees would be
permitted to travel to the Russian-controlled city of Svatove. Ukrainian
civilians forced to evacuate to areas under Russian control have
complained of abuse and degrading treatment at filtration camps.

Mizintsev, who heads Russia's National Defense Control Center, accused
Ukraine of positioning civilians at the plant as human shields. He
demanded the surrender of Ukrainian troops there, characterizing them as
"militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries."

[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his appeal]{.underline}
on Tuesday [for greater military aid to help Ukraine defend
itself]{.underline} in Luhansk and other areas, [saying that only
greater quantities of air and missile defense systems can help stave off
Russia's larger, more advanced military]{.underline}. Those weapons are
expected to be of increased importance in the artillery-heavy battle for
the Donbas region.

Zelensky cited missile attacks near Lviv and Ternopil on Tuesday, which
he said Ukrainian forces had been able to only partially defend against.

"We keep telling our partners that Ukraine needs modern antimissile
weapons. Our country does not have it at a sufficient level yet," he
said in a nightly video address. "Delay with its provision cannot be
justified."

How much new weaponry is provided, and what kind, may be defined on
Wednesday when officials gather in Brussels for a meeting of the s
Ukraine "defense contact group," which will be chaired by U.S. Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Austin touched down in Belgium on Tuesday ahead of that gathering, which
is expected to include up to 50 countries, and a separate meeting of
NATO defense ministers being held ahead of a June 29 alliance summit in
Madrid.

When NATO foreign ministers convened in April, Ukraine told the alliance
its priority issue was "weapons, weapons, weapons" --- a message that is
likely to be reiterated this week as the conflict drags through its
fourth month.

[While]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration [has not
revealed]{.underline} its [plans, [the **Pentagon's top policy
official**]{.mark}]{.underline} on Tuesday [[suggested **it would send
additional**]{.mark} **multiple-launch rocket [systems]{.mark} to
Ukraine**, potentially **[going farther to satisfy Ukrainian
demands]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Colin Kahl, who serves as undersecretary of defense for policy, said
the]{.underline} four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket
[[Systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, which can hit targets at longer
distance, [that Washington has [sent]{.mark} to Ukraine **[to date did
not represent the end]{.mark} of its supply** of such
weapons]{.underline}.

["**[We're going to provide the Ukrainians what they
need]{.mark}**]{.underline} to prosecute the targets inside Ukrainian
territory," [Kahl said]{.underline} during a think tank event in
Washington. Ukrainian officials have said they need at least 60 such
systems.

Western leaders [have gradually **[increased the array of arms they are
willing to provide]{.mark}** Ukraine since the beginning of the
war]{.underline}. But many remain nervous about supplying systems that
could be used to launch attacks deep into Russian territory or that
Putin might use as a reason to strike a NATO country.

In separate discussions in Brussels on Thursday, NATO allies are
expected to discuss a range of broader issues, including the alliance's
troop footprint in Eastern Europe and defense spending, conversations
that will continue at the late June summit in Madrid.

#### Ukraine will remain a [more urgent priority]{.underline}

**DoS 6-1**-22 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs, "U.S. Security Cooperation with Ukraine," Fact Sheet, 6-1-2022,

The United States, our allies, and our partners worldwide are united in
support of Ukraine in response to Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, and
unjustified war against Ukraine. We have not forgotten Russia's earlier
aggression in eastern Ukraine and occupation following its unlawful
seizure of Crimea in 2014. The United States reaffirms its unwavering
support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its
internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.

[**Ukraine** is a key regional strategic partner that has undertaken
significant efforts to modernize its military and increase its
interoperability with NATO. [**It remains an urgent security assistance
priority** to provide **Ukraine** the equipment it needs]{.mark} to
defend itself against Russia's war against Ukraine]{.underline}.

Since January 2021, the United States has invested more than \$5.3
billion in security assistance to demonstrate our enduring and steadfast
commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This
includes more than \$4.6 billion since Russia's launched its
premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine on February 24.
Since 2014, the United States has provided more than \$7.3 billion in
security assistance for training and equipment to help Ukraine preserve
its territorial integrity, secure its borders, and improve
interoperability with NATO.

### Thumper -- Taiwan

#### [Taiwan thumps]{.underline} -- it's being [prioritized]{.underline}

**Nakamura 6-13**-22 Ryo Nakamura, Nikkei staff writer, "U.S., Taiwan
set to hold strategic dialogue this month: sources," Nikkei Asia,

/GoGreen!

[[The **U.S.** and **Taiwan**]{.mark} are in the **final stages** of
preparation for a strategic bilateral dialogue between security
officials]{.underline}, three people with knowledge of the matter told
Nikkei.

The dialogue, [scheduled to take place **[by the end of this
month]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the U.S., is [[expected to focus
on]{.mark} specific measures for [**weapons provision** and **military
drills**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Officials [from]{.mark} the two sides will discuss details of
**[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation**]{.underline} under a regular
framework known as the \"Monterey talks\" \-- last held in autumn 2021
in the U.S., according to Taiwanese media. As a general rule, neither
plans for the talks nor details are publicly disclosed.

[One of the sources said the key theme for the upcoming dialogue would
be weapons support from the U.S., with [Washington **aiming to
prioritize** the **sale of weapons**]{.mark} that would be effective in
blocking potential Chinese landing operations on the
island]{.underline}.

The U.S. [**[Congress]{.mark}** is considering a [plan to provide
**several billion dollars**]{.mark} of financial support to Taiwan so
the island can procure weapons]{.underline}, Nikkei reported last month,
citing three sources connected to the legislature.

The **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration [**[intends to
prioritize]{.mark}** the sale of weapons with what it calls
\"**[asymmetric capabilities]{.mark}**\" \-- those that are agile,
inexpensive and effective in dealing with Chinese amphibious operations.
Specifically]{.underline}, they cover [anti-ship missiles and air
defense systems, as well as systems for gathering
intelligence]{.underline} needed to identify enemy movements and for
initiating early warnings.

But F-16 fighter jets, which the U.S. government has already decided to
sell to Taiwan, might not fall under this category. This implies that
the bar for additional fighter jet sales may be set higher in the
future.

[By **prioritizing** asymmetric weapons, the U.S. intends to quicken
reinforcement of capabilities in preventing the Chinese military from
landing operations on Taiwan]{.underline}. It also aims to encourage
Taiwan to allocate its budget more efficiently on the defense front.

It appears that the U.S. has prepared a list of weapons and systems it
recommends Taiwan to purchase, and selected about 20 specific weapons
and other items as preferred subjects of sale.

Taiwan was a hot theme at the weekend\'s Shangri-La Dialogue security
summit in Singapore.

\"Now, as a part of our One China policy, we will continue to fulfill
our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act,\" U.S. Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin said on Saturday. \"And that includes assisting Taiwan in
maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.\"

As roughly 100,000 Russian troops amass around [**Ukraine**, [a **series

attention** of **NATO**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly its most
powerful member, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

Now, there's a growing sense among national security experts that the
crisis in [**[Ukraine]{.mark}** is [just **one of many**]{.mark}
conflicts]{.underline} on the precipice, [putting pressure on the
alliance and its member countries to address this threat and at the same
time brace for the next one]{.underline}.

Indeed, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** this week [flew 39 warplanes
toward **[Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And consider the United Arab
Emirates reported this week it had intercepted multiple ballistic
missiles aimed at Abu Dhabi.

Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, described the ongoing
dispute between Russia and Ukraine as a "microcosm" of the types of
threats Western analysts were expecting all along. "All of this is
becoming very real," she said this week at a panel in Brussels sponsored
by [the German Marshall Fund of the United States]{.underline}.

At the same time, "[**[something could happen]{.mark}** on China and
Taiwan **[next week]{.mark}**," said Ian Lesser, vice president at the
think tank]{.underline}, referring to the possibility of China attacking
the U.S.-backed island nation that Beijing sees as a renegade province
to be eventually united with the mainland.

Asked about that possibility on Thursday, [**[Defense]{.mark}**
Department spokesman John Kirby [said]{.mark}]{.underline} the military
remains watchful of other theaters.

"I think [the gist]{.underline} of your question [is, why can't [we
**walk and chew gum at the same time**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he told
reporters at the Pentagon. "[We **can**, and we **are**. ... [Just
because we're focused on **bolstering our allies** because
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the worrisome accumulation of combat-credible
power by [the Russians in and around [**Ukraine** doesn't mean]{.mark}
that [we aren't focused on]{.mark} the pacing challenge that
**[China]{.mark}** represents]{.underline} to the department."

As NATO tries to use diplomacy to defuse tensions in Ukraine,
[**[planners]{.mark}** are finding the standoff reflects many of the
characteristics slated to make up the alliance's new strategic
concept]{.underline}.

[Analysts have long said]{.underline} the upcoming revision, up for
approval at the alliance's Madrid summit in late June, [[must consider
**defenses against**]{.mark} information warfare, **[cyber
attacks]{.mark}**, economic pressure and an overall increase in conflict
complexity that exceeds that of traditional military
operations]{.underline}.

**[[Much of that is happening right now]{.underline}]{.mark}**,

With NATO and U.S. written responses delivered to Moscow on Wednesday,
diplomacy is still running its course. Russia wants the alliance to
close the door to an eventual Ukrainian membership, a prospect
considered notional at best even within NATO.

Alliance officials, in turn, have touted the principle that Russia's
neighbor nations should be able to pick their own path in matters of
defense and security.

That idea doesn't sit well with the Kremlin, where President Vladimir
Putin is nursing dreams of restoring past Russian grandeur along ethnic,
religious and language lines, incorporating some of its neighbors,
according to Western analysts.

Still, the guns remained silent on mid-day Friday.

"I think the West is doing fairly well in managing a conflict that
cannot be deterred," said Hal Brands, a senior fellow with
Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think
tank, and a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies.

Brands said he believes Moscow's demands were so outrageous an eventual
armed confrontation was likely baked into them from the start. At this
point, he said, Putin may be more interested in continuing the pace of
escalation rather than agreeing to a diplomatic solution.

Deterrence has been the name of the game in Europe, however, where
countries are [[trumpeting **weapon shipments**]{.mark} large and small
[into **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline}, publicly scorning the one
government not going along: Berlin.

European countries still view their relationship with Russia through
bilateral lenses, said Rachel Rizzo, an analyst with the Atlantic
Council think tank. "That's why they are sidelined," she added,
referring to the fact that the European Union has no formal role in the
ongoing negotiations.

German government officials have defended their position of sending only
help that neither shoots nor explodes, like helmets, arguing a plus-up
in combat capabilities would be too insignificant to warrant undermining
Berlin's policy of hopeful hedging. But inside the country, some
analysts are arguing it's time to take a stance militarily.

The situation is emblematic for how disjointed Europe's position
continues to be on key defense issues, and how its biggest economic
player is finding itself isolated, said Christian Mölling of the
Berlin-based German Council on Foreign Relations.

"We have left a vacuum that the Americans are forced to fill once
again," he said.

The defense attaché system structure, mission, and manning have not
evolved with the changes of the last decade that require increased
levels of involvement in operational activity. [The primary attaché
function of [**observing and reporting** is]{.mark} often
[considered]{.mark} to be [in]{.mark} direct [conflict with **time** and
**energy** spent on other]{.mark}]{.underline} nonintelligence
[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Intelligence and
[[**military-diplomatic activity** are **not zero-sum** competing
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}. Narrow specialization by other DOD
elements has undermined the overall effectiveness of the military
attaché by reducing access to the host nation military. DOD
representation abroad should be the military attaché. Security
assistance and arms control would be better managed by trained attachés
with the requisite language skills, cultural knowledge, and regional
expertise. This approach would eliminate parochialism, reduce overhead,
streamline operations, and simplify bilateral coordination for the host
nation military.

Transformation of the military attaché corps begins at the higher
headquarters. The nature and function of a headquarters influence the
priorities of its subordinate elements. By eliminating stovepipe
organizations inside the U.S. Embassy in a consolidated DAO, the
combatant command headquarters will need to establish a
Politico-Military Directorate to manage, deconflict, and synchronize the
activities of military attachés. This transformed organization will
integrate national requirements for observing and reporting, supporting
operational and exercise taskings, security assistance, and strategy and
policy. More coherent policy and guidance will enable the military
attachés to apply the informational instrument of national power more
effectively. Making the director of this new organization within each
combatant command a general/flag officer with attaché experience will
brighten the promotion prospects for attaché duty and attract higher
quality officers.

**[[Realigned]{.mark} Mission [Priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[**Security cooperation** and the war on terror have increased the
strategic importance of military attachés serving abroad.]{.underline}
Considering the extensive actions to coordinate the deployment of U.S.
forces against the Taliban in Afghanistan and support the
train-and-equip operation in Georgia, attachés provide a tremendous
value to the combatant commanders as operators and reporters.
Independent of transformation, [they have four main missions that
**[seamlessly blend]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Advising the Ambassador. Military attachés must know the host nation
military and strategic environment and be intimate with the U.S.
military's capabilities to support diplomatic and engagement measures.
The DATT provides advice on the full range of issues concerning regional
security, to include the attitudes and intentions of the host nation and
other nations engaged in regional activities. Finally, most DATTs also
serve as the U.S. defense representative charged with managing the
coordination of administrative and security matters of all DOD personnel
who fall under responsibility of the U.S. Ambassador. However, this
command relationship would be more effective with defense attachés
assigned to the same higher headquarters as the other DOD elements---the
combatant command.

[Representing DOD to the host nation]{.underline}. More than playing a
ceremonial role, military attachés are a highly visible symbol of the
Armed Forces. Especially critical in Eurasia where the Iron Curtain
allowed for little interaction with Americans during the Cold War, they
provide daily access to the host nation military regarding information,
capabilities, and strategies. They are generally contacted before all
others in a crisis. They serve a large public diplomacy function as
well.

[**[Reporting]{.mark}** conditions in the host country]{.underline}.
Attachés observe military conditions and developments. This [[is a
**continuous mission**]{.mark} that must be **[integrated into
all]{.mark} their [activities]{.mark}**. To succeed in security
cooperation, policymakers and decisionmakers require actionable
information]{.underline}. [It is often **attaché input** that **makes
for effective security cooperation** programs]{.underline}. During
periods of heightened tension and crisis, the attaché supports the
combatant commander by becoming his eyes and ears on the scene,
responding quickly to time-sensitive information requirements.
[Increasingly, military attachés serve as the conduit for sharing
information]{.underline}, especially in support of the war on terror.
Lastly, corruption remains a huge problem in Eurasia, and military
attachés provide oversight to monitor whether U.S. resources and funds
are used appropriately.

[**Managing security cooperation** programs]{.underline}. [Worldwide,
about half of all DAOs manage formal security assistance programs such
as]{.underline} the International Military Education and Training
([IMET]{.underline}) program [and]{.underline} Foreign Military
Financing ([FMF]{.underline}). [[In **activities unique to the former
Soviet Union**]{.mark}, the military attaché **[already]{.mark}** plays
a substantial role in **[coordinating]{.mark}** and executing the
[**extensive** **mil**]{.mark}**itary-to-[mil]{.mark}itary** programs,
[**exercises**, and **deployments**]{.mark}, [which
**frequently**]{.mark}]{.underline} dwarf **[[\[eclipse\] IMET and FMF
responsibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Even in countries with
security assistance offices, attachés still make recommendations on
**spending priorities**]{.underline} and approve IMET candidates.

Improved Manning Posture

Many DATT positions in remote regions are occupied by hard-working but
junior majors or senior first-time attachés with limited choices for
their terminal assignment. Lack of experience, language skills, rank, or
maturity is not a recipe for success. Many countries recognize the
strategic importance of their military attachés and send only their best
abroad. Because of the symbolic and ceremonial importance of rank, and
the requirement for experience and maturity, DATT billets should be
filled by colonels (or Navy captains) and represented by the service
that logically corresponds to that which dominates in the host country.
Most importantly, DAOs must have sufficient depth to permit attachés to
operate in multiple geographical locations.

To what degree is the United States able to resort to military power
without dependence on foreign governments? [The military attaché manages
the day-to-day bilateral relations for national policymakers and
combatant commanders]{.underline}. Transforming the attaché corps will
substantially improve the steady state military diplomacy that must be
conducted prior to any crisis. Changing the status quo will improve
interagency coordination and provide the combatant commander the
representation he needs within his area of responsibility. The military
attaché corps must adapt to the new strategic environment, which demands
skillful military diplomacy and knowledgeable professionals. Like the
Special Operations Soldiers who achieved fame in Afghanistan by
demonstrating their strategic value, military attachés have the
potential to provide significant returns in the area of military
diplomacy, while at the same time providing better reporting on a wider
range of important issues.

DOD officials can work around the State Department's diplomats. In part
due to restrictions from the Budget Control Act and [[with **new

crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}, something that is virtually impossible
for the State Department, making the DOD often the lead actor in a
crisis.44 Regional combatant commands aggressively sought more resources
from Congress to conduct their own security assistance programs, giving
them added flexibility to work with partners in the field that their
State Department counterparts lacked.45 A Government Accountability
Office report found that 56 DOD security assistance programs do not
require any involvement from the State Department.46

The U.S. military must plan for a wide range of security cooperation1
missions, ranging from "normal" peacetime security cooperation
activities---such as building the long-term institutional and
operational capabilities and capacity of key partners and allies,
establishing and deepening relationships between the U.S. and partner
militaries, and securing access to critical areas overseas---to managing
quasi-operational efforts, such as managing foreign internal defense
within the overall foreign policy objectives of the United States.
Security cooperation, in the form of noncombat military-to-military
activities, is a useful part of the military's toolkit in conflict
prevention.2 Although [**[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation**
[requires a relatively **small investment**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
respect to the overall efforts of the U.S. military, [it can be a key
enabler of the success of future U.S. military missions by shaping the
environment and laying the groundwork for future coalition and stability

Fortunately, those too often disjointed outcomes are now collapsing into
a far more synergistic endeavor [thanks to the N]{.underline}ational
[D]{.underline}efense [A]{.underline}uthorization [A]{.underline}ct [of
2017]{.underline}, and in particular the codification of Title 10,
Chapter 16, Security Cooperation.

Congress redefined nearly everything DOD does with a foreign partner as
"security cooperation." That definition includes not just exercises and
information sharing---which is the traditional forte of operational
forces---but the Army's support of State Department-approved foreign
military sales cases, direct commercial sales, the training provided to
foreign partners at our schoolhouses and other programs as defined by
Title 22 Security Assistance, a State Department authority executed by
DOD.

Importantly, [the [**new law** **mandates**]{.mark} the creation of a
**[formalized a]{.mark}ssessment, [m]{.mark}onitoring [and
e]{.mark}valuation [efforts]{.mark}** to foster more accurate and

cooperation outcomes and an evaluation of the reasons for success or
lack thereof]{.underline}. This new accountability requirement intends
[[to]{.mark} identify and **[disseminate best practices]{.mark}**
and]{.underline} lessons for security cooperation [to inform decisions
about policy, plans, programs and workforce]{.underline}. The law also
requires an annual report to Congress on the measurable results of U.S.
security cooperation investments.

Meanwhile, the **[O]{.underline}**ffice of the

which provide security cooperation programs and activities [[with

investment on the executing unit or agency, [[and the **results** are

MAJOR UPDATE

DOD publications updated as part of the National Defense Authorization
Act of 2017:

· Department of Defense Directive 5132.03, "DOD Policy and
Responsibilities Relating to Security Cooperation."

· Department of Defense Instruction 5132.14, "Assessment, Monitoring,
and Evaluation Policy for the Security Cooperation Enterprise."

· Department of Defense Instruction 5132.15, "Implementation of the
Security Cooperation Workforce Certification Program."

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency's comprehensive and expanded
mission, according to the agency's website, is "to advance U.S. defense
and foreign policy interests by building the capacity of foreign
partners in order to encourage and enable allies and partners to respond
to shared challenges." Important aspects of the agency's mission are the
tasks of managing and training the department's security cooperation
workforce and demonstrating the return on program investments, all while
continuing to perform their traditional core functions such as defense
trade and arms transfer, institutional capability building and
international education and training. Much of that mission passes to
each of the military services for execution through a variety of new
guidance like that for workforce certification.

CONVERGING EFFORTS

Understandably, [[the new]{.mark} **DOD** and **D**efense **S**ecurity
**C**ooperation **A**gency [**guidance** **resulted
in**]{.mark}]{.underline} the Army [**[rethinking
top-to-bottom]{.mark}** how it engages with foreign partners and manages
its workforce]{.underline}. Specifically, the materiel side of
international engagement, the Army security assistance enterprise, led
by DASA (DE&C), began to collaborate more closely with the operational
forces headed by the Army's G-3/5/7. That synergistic effort resulted in
the formulation of new Army guidance for the security cooperation
enterprise that more closely aligns with "General Order 2020-01,
Assignment of Functions and Responsibilities within Headquarters,
Department of the Army," and updated critical guidance in security
cooperation-related Army regulations.

[[This **refreshed**]{.underline}]{.mark} Army policy
marriage---[[operational **s**]{.mark}**ecurity

whole-of-Army approach, which [aligns plans that equip and train allies
and foreign partners to better]{.underline} contribute to the Army
Campaign Plan, the service's guidance for [allocating resources and
tasks to satisfy the DOD mandates]{.underline}.

NEW REGS

Army publications created or updated in response to DOD changes:

· Army Regulation 11-31, "Army Security Cooperation Policy."

· Army Regulation 12-1, "Security Assistance, Training, and Export
Policy."

· Army Regulation 5-22, "The Army Force Modernization Proponent System."

The Army validated this new relationship with a number of significant
administrative and strategy documents. In particular, those documents
include the designation of the Army chief of operations and DASA (DE&C)
as the Army's force modernization co-leads for security cooperation.
These partners also co-developed the Army Strategy for Allies and
Partners and three of its annexes: Implementation of Security
Cooperation with Allies and Partners, the Global Prioritization
Assessment and Country Specific Guidance.

As Part I of this study discussed, Army security cooperation activities
have aligned fairly well with what previous analyses have found
contribute to effectiveness in both security cooperation and
international development assistance. However, [[**across the U.S.
government**, **requirements** for]{.mark} more rigorous and systematic
[**AM&E** are **growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Army, with the rest
of DoD, must improve its ability to analyze and report the extent to
which its security cooperation activities are meeting their objectives.
As Part I makes clear, there is still much to be learned. As the United
States increases the scope of security cooperation, in terms of both
activity and partner types, planners will need to understand not only
what has been effective in the past but also how to identify lessons
from the broader range of partners the United States is engaging. Part
II of this study focuses on helping the Army develop an AM&E
implementation framework that will better link security cooperation
activities to their outcomes.

AM&E Developments---and Requirements---Are Accelerating

Within the past ten years, several developments have laid the
foundations for a more strategic and analytically rigorous approach to
security cooperation. As shown in Figure 4.1, [these developments have
arisen at several levels of government: Congress, the White House, OSD,
DSCA, and combatant commands (CCMDs), and within the Army]{.underline}
itself.

[First, an important impetus for DoD's recent efforts to improve the
security cooperation AM&E process has come from
**Congress**]{.underline}, some of whose members [are eager for the
department to improve its ability to track security cooperation resource
expenditures and demonstrate the effectiveness of security cooperation
programs in achieving DoD objectives]{.underline} at the national,
theater, or country level. In Section 1202 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress mandated that DoD
work with the Department of State (DoS) to establish a strategic
framework for security cooperation "to guide prioritization of resources
and activities." Furthermore, it specified that one of the elements of
this strategic framework would be "a methodology for assessing the
effectiveness of Department of Defense security cooperation programs in
making progress toward achieving the primary objectives, priorities, and
desired end-states . . . including an identification of key benchmarks
for such progress."1 [[The]{.mark} FY **[2017 NDAA]{.mark}** reiterates
the]{.underline} previous NDAA's [call for a **security**]{.underline}
**\[Figure 4.1 OMITTED\] [cooperation AM&E framework]{.underline}**[,
but **goes further** by **requiring** an "**independent assessment** of
defense security cooperation programs."]{.underline}2

[Second, the **N**ational **S**ecurity **C**ouncil laid the groundwork
in 2013]{.underline} for a more integrated approach to security sector
assistance. [Directed primarily at DoS and DoD,
**[P]{.mark}**residential **[P]{.mark}**olicy **[D]{.mark}**irective
**[23]{.mark}** (Security Sector Assistance Policy) called for "a
deliberate and inclusive whole-of-government process that ensures
alignment of activities and resources with \[U.S.\] national security
priorities]{.underline}." Among other things, this meant ensuring
greater consistency between programs and objectives, fostering
transparency and coordination across U.S. government agencies, building
sustainable partner security capacity through comprehensive sector
strategies, being more selective in the use of security assistance
resources to achieve the greatest impact, and informing policy with
rigorous analysis, assessment, and evaluations. According to the
directive, this latter effort [would involve introducing "common
standards and expectations for assessing security cooperation
requirements" as well as "investing in monitoring and evaluation of
security sector assistance programs."]{.underline} Although the emphasis
was on greater standardization of AM&E policies and procedures
throughout the security assistance sector, the directive did indicate
that newly established "standards and data collection will take into
account the varying security and information environments where U.S.
programs operate."3

[Third, in 2016 OSD released Department of Defense Instruction
(**[DoDI]{.mark}**) Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation Policy for the
Security Cooperation Enterprise, which provides guidance for a "whole of
DoD" approach to security cooperation AM&E]{.underline}. It asserts that
"accountability and learning are the primary purposes" of AM&E, and
highlights AM&E's importance in demonstrating security cooperation's
"returns on investment" so policymakers might "identify and improve or
eliminate ineffective initiatives" as well as garner evidentiary support
for policy and legislative proposals.4

[The DoDI specifies two main military service requirements in supporting
CCMD AM&E: (1) an initial (country-level) assessment of the security
cooperation environment and (2) an initial design document (IDD) for
"significant" security cooperation initiatives]{.underline}. "The
initial assessment provides an understanding of the context, conditions,
partner capabilities, and requirements immediately before the
implementation of security cooperation initiatives and other
activities." It informs initiative design and establishes a "baseline
against which to track progress." The IDD contains milestones and
measures that allow for performance monitoring and "independent and
rigorous evaluations" of initiative "relevance, effectiveness, and
sustainability."5 The IDD must also include a TOC.

[Within the terms of the DoDI, the **GCCs have the primary security
cooperation AM&E role**. Their responsibilities include (1) leading
initial assessment efforts, (2) orchestrating the assessment process,
(3) formulating IDDs for all significant initiatives, (4) monitoring all
significant initiatives, and (5) submitting to DSCA all initial country
assessments and IDDs for new security cooperation
initiatives]{.underline}.6 Based on the analysis in this report,
services play an important role in every step of the AM&E process,
particularly for the activities they implement directly. ASCCs play a
particularly important role linking Army security cooperation to GCCs'
initial assessment and IDD.

[In addition to issuing the DoDI, **OSD** has **encouraged** the
development of **AM&E** processes, for example, by highlighting the
importance of AM&E in various [other **guidance
doc**]{.mark}**ument[s]{.mark}** and hosting DoD-wide and **interagency
[workshops]{.mark}** to share best practices]{.underline}. These efforts
were accelerated and better integrated after OSD's establishment of a
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation in 2015.
This office undertook several initiatives over the past two years,
supported by RAND's National Defense Research Institute, which focused
on institutionalizing best practices in security cooperation planning,
transparency, and AM&E.7

[Fourth]{.underline}, innovative concepts for using [technology to
improve data collection have allowed hundreds of U.S. security
cooperation practitioners around the globe to report on their activities
in more methodical and comprehensive ways]{.underline} and for
policymakers and program managers to provide more rigorous oversight.
[The creation of **security cooperation management information systems**
by the GCCs and other DoD organizations provided unprecedented platforms
for planning, resourcing, assessing, monitoring, and evaluating future
security cooperation AM&E efforts. These largely independent initiatives
have begun to coalesce in the form of a **comprehensive tool for
tracking DoD security cooperation activities and resources**:
**[G-TSCMIS]{.mark}**, whose development is being managed by DSCA (with
support from the Joint Staff) and is required to be used by all DoD
security cooperation activity managers]{.underline}. G-TSCMIS is still a
work in progress, and CCMDs face challenges getting all relevant
activities included in the system.8 Still, even when G-TSCMIS is fully
developed and widely used, it will not fulfill all the information
management needs required for effective security cooperation planning
and AM&E, which is why the CCMDs and other security cooperation
organizations continue to use their own systems.

In addition to overseeing the development of G-TSCMIS, DSCA has also
recently launched an initiative to formalize security cooperation
workforce competencies and associated experiential and training
requirements, which could eventually contribute to a larger pool of
qualified AM&E professionals within the security cooperation field.

[Fifth, the **[Joint Staff]{.mark}** has also played an important role
in attempting to improve and standardize security cooperation and
security force assistance (SFA) **[doctrine]{.mark}**, including with
respect to AM&E]{.underline}. Acknowledging the challenge of determining
the extent to which security cooperation activities have contributed to
U.S. objectives, the draft Joint Publication 3-20 provides guidelines
for three kinds of security cooperation assessments: operations
assessments (which focus on "are we doing the right things"), task
assessments (which focus on "are we doing things right"), and functional
assessments (which focus on "are we efficient [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
effective").9

[Sixth, OSD established theater campaign plans (**[TCPs]{.mark}**) for
CCMDs and campaign support plans for the military services as a way of
applying military planning techniques beyond traditional war plans to
incorporate more steady-state activities like security
cooperation]{.underline}. These plans allowed for a Secretary of
Defense--led analysis and discussion of security cooperation ends, ways,
and means that did not exist before. [More recently, the CCMDs have
begun to develop **[country plans]{.mark}** that [promise a **clear
auditing trail**]{.mark} between theater objectives and the means
(activities and resources)]{.underline} employed to achieve them that
involve U.S. allies and partner nations, given appropriate country
objectives and metrics as well as improved country-level data
collection.
