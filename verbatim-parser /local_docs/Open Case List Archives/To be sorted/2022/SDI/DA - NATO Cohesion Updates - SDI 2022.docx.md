[[The trilateral memorandum signed]{.mark} among Turkey, Finland, and
Sweden on June 28 [is a]{.mark} welcome [development]{.mark} designed
[to demonstrate NATO's]{.mark} solidarity and [unity, and further
strengthen the Alliance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is commonplace in NATO to consult on and negotiate over any dispute
among allies and would-be allies to find a common ground. That is how
NATO plays its role, and at the end a solution accommodating such
concerns is found by consensus.

It is also true that once new members accede to NATO, they are bound by
the decisions previously taken by the Alliance on a wide range of
subjects. In NATO there exists a robust set of decisions and practices
in fighting terrorism, beginning with the intervention in Afghanistan.
Therefore, there is already an agreement comprising all sorts of
conceptual work and practices in different geographical theaters on
combatting terrorism, developed within NATO and binding on all members.

The newly adopted Strategic Concept (SC) clearly identifies Russia and
"terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations" as the primary sources
of threats in a 360-degree manner and across all three core tasks of
NATO: collective deterrence and defense, crisis prevention and
management, and cooperative security. [[Given that terrorism is "the
most direct asymmetric threat to the security]{.mark} of our citizens
and to international peace and prosperity," [as defined in the
SC]{.mark},]{.underline} [it [makes sense both for Finland and Sweden to
cooperate with Turkey in combatting terrorism]{.mark} as one of the
primary sources of threats against Alliance interests.]{.underline}

In a nutshell, collective deterrence and defense against actual and
potential adversaries, nipping crises in the bud, and expanding the web
of networks with partners under challenging circumstances are the main
tasks of NATO in the next decade.

The main center of gravity for NATO is its solidarity, unity, and
cohesion, including all allies and those set to become allies.

[[The summit decision]{.mark}s in their entirety will [help NATO to
navigate]{.mark} the troubled waters ahead [over the long
term]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

#### Erdogan's stance is all political

politics and culture, one of MHPC\'s 30 journalists under 30 to watch,

ISTANBUL --- Restaurants have invested in wipe-clean menus so they can
update their prices daily. Taxi drivers are asking passengers to top up
their fares to meet rising fuel costs. A cappuccino that cost 20 lira
earlier this year is now 30 lira.

["It's ridiculous," said Osman, who runs a local coffee shop and is
trying to keep up with **[Turkey's runaway inflation]{.mark}** ---
[officially at a 20-year high]{.mark} of 70 percent and, according to
the independent Inflation Research Group, more than double
that.]{.underline}

[Yet]{.mark} as anxiety courses through the country and elections loom
in 2023, [President Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan\'s rhetoric]{.mark} has only
become increasingly uncompromising, [rejecting calls to change]{.mark}
monetary [policy in the face of]{.mark} voters' [financial
fears]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[**[Instead, Erdoğan is looking abroad to help solve his country's
problems]{.mark}**, partly out of economic necessity, and partly [out of
political expediency.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In Ukraine, Ankara has emerged as a major military supplier to Kyiv,
while also positioning itself as a diplomatic power broker and refusing
to adopt Western sanctions against Moscow. A major reason: Turkey has a
large financial stake in both countries it wants to preserve.

[And [at the NATO summit in Madrid]{.mark} this week, [Erdoğan]{.mark}
made sure he was front and center, [threatening to block Sweden and
Finlan]{.mark}d from joining the alliance before backing down after they
committed to helping Turkey thwart Kurdish groups --- [giving him a
center-stage photo op.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Elsewhere, [[Erdoğan has riled up nationalist sentiment --- **a
vote-winning strategy**]{.underline}. [By painting]{.underline}]{.mark}
Greece as an external threat to Turkey's territory, and [[Kurdish
separatism as an internal one]{.mark}, he has [created a sense that the
country is facing attacks that only he can protect it
against]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[Everyone\'s wondering what on earth Erdogan is up to]{.underline}**
-- first he impedes the Nato accession of Finland and Sweden, then he
gives the go-ahead after apparently winning concessions on Kurdish
terror allegedly hatched by expat Kurds in those countries. Or so it
seems. The same Erdogan who defied Russia by selling those devastating
drones to Ukraine. Is he pro-West or pro-Moscow? What\'s his game? [[He
manifestly used the Finland/Sweden accession issue as bargaining
leverage. What does he really hope to squeeze from
Nato?]{.underline}]{.mark} [For the answers, you won\'t get any real
help from authentic Turkish pundits trotted out by big news orgs like
the BBC. If they\'re based in Turkey, they can\'t be too candid for fear
of being persecuted under Erdogan\'s repressive anti-media laws.
And]{.underline} [the on-site foreign reporters aren\'t much better
since their HUMINT contacts are watched and the news media they read
locally is muzzled]{.underline}.

So, does Erdogan\'s noisemaking about Kurds reflect his genuine
concerns? Yes and no. Mostly no. Anyway, neither Finland or Sweden will
hand over anybody that Erdogan asks for extra-judicially with trumped-up
accusations -- as the BBC outlines. More about the Kurds later. [Erdogan
has bigger concerns**,** chief [among]{.mark} which is the consolidation
of his regime in a time of [**galloping inflation** and **economic
meltdown** at home]{.mark}. With a parliamentary general election coming
up in the new year, [his party is heading for a major
loss**.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In reality, what Erdogan really wants is
a pledge of non-interference from Western democracies in his internal
affairs. Likely because he intends to keep power in his hands through
various authoritarian maneuvers. In effect, he stays as President and
maintains state capture from there. [[He is saying to the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}, \'You need me to co-ordinate on Nato actions?
[[Don\'t subvert my hold on power]{.underline}]{.mark} and don\'t be
championing political prisoners like Osman Kavala, or any number of
jailed journalists and Kurdish politicians. Don\'t oppose my upcoming
anti-democratic ruses.\' **[[That\'s]{.mark} [his]{.mark} main
[condition]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But there\'s more.

[[Since Russia attacked]{.mark} Ukraine]{.underline} on February 24,
[[we have been witnessing]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[important changes
in]{.mark} not only European but also national foreign, security and
defense [policies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[In the past, Europeans]{.mark} often [appeared reluctant to
coordinate]{.mark} their national foreign, security and defense
policies.]{.underline} Instead, they preferred to "go it alone". [The
[Ukraine]{.mark} crisis]{.underline}, [however]{.underline}, [[has
elicited a **strong**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**unified response** from
the]{.underline}]{.mark} European Union ([[EU]{.underline}]{.mark}), the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}),
[[and]{.mark} their [member states **as never
before**.]{.mark}]{.underline} To put pressure on the Kremlin and bring
the war to an end as soon as possible, the EU, in close coordination
with its North American allies, has adopted unprecedented measures. In
June, EU member states agreed upon a sixth package of sanctions, which
included an embargo on Russian oil imports (currently 90%) and the
removal of three Russian banks from the international SWIFT payment
platform. They also granted Ukraine and Moldova EU candidate status.
This would have been unthinkable only a few months ago.

In addition, the EU activated for the first time the European Peace
Facility (EPF), a newly established off-budget fund that replaced,
merged and expanded the scope of the Athena Mechanism and the African
Peace Facility, and introduced the possibility for the EU to deliver
lethal weapons to third countries. Through the EPF, the bloc has already
provided \$1.5 billion (€1.5 billion) in financial support to Ukraine's
military, with an additional \$500 million (€500 million) announced on
May 24. The next day, the European Commission (EC) adopted the second
annual work program of the European Defence Fund (EDF), through which it
has been scaling up funding for collaborative research in innovative
defense products and technologies. The EC also introduced some new
measures to promote defense innovation under a new umbrella: the EU
Defence Innovation Scheme (EUDIS). In Versailles, EU leaders had agreed
on the need for more effective defense spending. This \$2 billion (€2
billion) investment will spur defense innovation while reducing
industrial fragmentation wherever possible in coordination with NATO's
Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic (DIANA) and the
freshly launched Innovation Fund.

Meanwhile, [[NATO has been **progressively bolstering defense** along
its eastern flank]{.mark} in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
In February, [the Alliance activated the]{.mark}]{.underline} NATO
Response Force ([[NRF]{.underline}]{.mark}), a high-readiness
multinational force of 40,000 troops that can be deployed quickly in
response to an emerging crisis. The NRF was activated [[for the first
time for]{.mark} the purpose of [deterrence and defense]{.mark} instead
of crisis management.]{.underline} More recently [at the NATO
Summit]{.underline} in Madrid, US President Joe [[Biden
announced]{.mark} that [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [would establish a permanent US Army
headquarters in Poland and further [expand]{.mark} US [military presence
in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, which currently stands at around 100,000
troops.

**Stoltenberg 7/15** --- Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General at NATO,
former Prime Minister of Norway, 2022 ("Strategic solidarity after
Madrid, a conversation with Jens Stoltenberg," *groupe d'études

*In this global geopolitical landscape, NATO's unity remains a key
issue. Yet, the ideological divide between democracy and autocracy also
runs through the organization, if we look for example at Turkey, but
also Hungary or Poland. In addition, there are disputes between members
threatening the cohesion of the Atlantic alliance, with renewed tensions
for instance between Greece and Turkey in the Eastern Mediterranean. Is
NATO actually as united as it seemed during the Madrid Summit, both in
terms of values and interests?*

NATO is based on some core principles such as the rule of law,
individual liberties and freedom. These values are extremely important
-- I attach great importance to them myself. At the same time, you are
right that we see, both in the European Union and in NATO, that some
countries raise concerns about the extent to which they fully adhere to
these values. It is not for me to speak for the European Union but I can
say that I believe that NATO is an important platform for countries to
raise these concerns and to address exactly these issues. Over the years
during which I have been Secretary General of NATO, I have raised such
concerns in different capitals. I think that it is better if we discuss
those issues openly and frankly within the organization because it is
the best way to ensure that these values -- democracy, freedom -- are
respected to the highest degree possible.

[What [we saw in Madrid]{.mark} was [**an alliance of thirty
allies**.]{.mark} When you have so many countries from both sides of the
Atlantic]{.underline}, [with different cultures,]{.underline} different
[history,]{.underline} different [political parties in government,
[there will **obviously** be important differences]{.mark} among them.
So [if one defines unity as something that is
**monolithic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[where everyone agrees **on every
issue at all times**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[then **of course** that is
not how I see it.]{.mark} We are different, there will be disagreements
between allies, as it has been throughout NATO's history.]{.underline}
We could go back to the Suez crisis in 1956 or when France decided to
leave military cooperation in NATO in 1967, or the Iraq war and many
other issues. [There have been differences in the past and there will be
differences in the future.]{.underline}

[**The [unity]{.mark} of NATO [is demonstrated]{.mark} however**
[through the fact that **despite**]{.mark} **these
[differences]{.mark}** [we unite around our **core task** to protect and
defend]{.mark} each other. [We have done that successfully for]{.mark}
more than [seventy years]{.mark}]{.underline}, [by preventing any armed
attack against any NATO ally]{.underline} since our foundation in 1949
[and by helping to secure peace throughout Europe and the North Atlantic
area. War used to be the normality in this area]{.underline}, [but now
we have seen an unprecedented period of peace.]{.underline} This is
because of the role played by many different institutions -- the EU in
particular has played a key role, as well as NATO. It is also important
not to forget that NATO's enlargement has helped to pave the way for EU
enlargement. So I strongly believe that in uncertain times, it is even
more important to have strong international institutions.
