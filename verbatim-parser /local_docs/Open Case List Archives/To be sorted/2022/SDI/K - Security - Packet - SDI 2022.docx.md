What's the Problem Represented to be? (WPR) approach to policy analysis

Question 1: What's the problem (e.g., of "gender inequality", "drug
use/abuse", "economic development", "global warming", "childhood
obesity", "irregular migration", etc.) represented to be in a specific
policy or policies?

Question 2: What deep-seated presuppositions or assumptions underlie
this representation of the "problem" (problem representation)?

Question 3: How has this representation of the "problem" come about?

Question 4: What is left unproblematic in this problem representation?
Where are the silences? Can the "problem" be conceptualized differently?

Question 5: What effects (discursive, subjectification, lived) are
produced by this representation of the "problem"?

Question 6: How and where has this representation of the "problem" been
produced, disseminated and defended? How has it been and/or how can it
be disrupted and replaced?

Step 7: Apply this list of questions to your own problem
representations.

One could imagine that the saying 'There is life in an old dog yet' fits
quite well for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Many
serious challenges threatened its cohesion, such as the Suez crisis in
1956, the disputes over the so-called double track-decision in 1979, and
the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact in 1993. While the history of the
alliance has often been told as a history of crises (e.g. Stanley
Hoffman, 1981), neither internal disputes over the war in Iraq nor the
disappearance of a 'communist threat' have led to a break-up of NATO.
The transatlantic alliance lives on. It has even expanded in size and
tasks after the end of the Cold War. Recent tensions between 'the West'
and Russia over Crimea and Ukraine make clear that the Atlantic alliance
is anything but dead. As Stephen Walt put it: 'NATO owes Putin a big
thank-you' (Walt, 2014).

[[In]{.mark} International Relations (**IR**), **[debates]{.mark}** on
the Atlantic alliance have witnessed ups and downs]{.underline} as well.
[While [**realist**, **liberal**, and **institutionalist**
scholars]{.mark} strove to **[explain]{.mark}** the existence and
persistence of [**NATO** by]{.mark} referring either to an alliance
against **threat**]{.underline} (Walt, 1990, 1997), [an alliance of
**democracies**]{.underline} (Risse-Kappen, 1995, Risse, 1996), [or a
**security manager**]{.underline} (Wallander, 2000), [other approaches
have advocated a more critical and reflective understanding of the
**discourses** and practices which **constitute(d) the alliance** in the
first place]{.underline} (Klein, 1990; Bially Mattern, 2005; Behnke,
2013; Hellmann, 2006; Jackson 2003; Neumann and Williams, 2000; Pouliot,
2010; Adler, 2008). [NATO's lasting ability to overcome internal and
external challenges to its cohesion]{.underline}, I will argue, [directs
our attention exactly to the [**discursive practices** which
enable]{.mark}d a [**continuous reconstitution** of a **Western security
community**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By re-constitution I refer to
the]{.underline} Janus-faced [**process** of [**activating** and
**transforming**]{.mark} foundational [**narratives** which **justify**
the]{.mark} existence and **[continuity of NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[This process commonly [includes **constructions of threats**
and]{.mark} a sense of [a **shared identity**]{.mark} which are both
[ingrained in **symbolic orders**]{.mark} and [**mobilized by
articulations** of a **common security strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Of further interest, therefore, is how]{.underline} the allies
[answered the question why NATO should exist, how they invented and
[used]{.mark} a common notion of [**identity**, **interests**, and
**threats**]{.mark} in order [to **justify**]{.mark} a deep and lasting
pattern of **[military cooperation]{.mark}** between North America and
(Western) European states]{.underline}. Such [[a critical]{.mark}
constructivist [approach **directs our attention** to the **political
dynamics** whereby a **Western security community** is **invented in the
first place** **instead of**]{.mark} **already [presuming it]{.mark} as
taken for granted**]{.underline} (cf. Tilly, 1998, Bartelson, 2009,
Herborth, 2009). It emphasizes that [the **practical usage of meaning**
imbues an act of political power with quite **tremendous institutional
consequences**]{.underline}. Invented as a geopolitical community of
solidarity in the early 1950s with a clear distinction of friends and
enemies, NATO symbolized more than a classical military alliance.
Compared to the 'pledge' of collective defense in Article 5 of the North
Atlantic Treaty, Article 4 emphasized that the allies 'will consult
together whenever . . . the territorial integrity, political
independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened'. Exactly
this invocation of a political community made NATO's evolution possible
and enabled a smooth reorientation towards out-of-area missions and
Eastern enlargement in the 1990s.

This chapter continues with a brief conceptual discussion of the
relationship between identity and security by focusing on critical
constructivist approaches in IR. In the second section I turn to NATO's
strategic discourse in the late 1940s/early 1950s and the 1990s. In
these two periods, the Atlantic alliance seemed to be tenuous, but its
(continued) existence could be restored by the declaration of a common
strategic concept. In conclusion I show how these discursive foundations
of a transatlantic alliance relate to the overall theme of this volume,
the (re-)constitution of 'the West'.

1 Foundational Narratives: Securing a Western Community

In the last twenty years, [a turn to discourses and practices has
altered the field of security studies in many ways]{.underline} (Buzan
and Hansen, 2009). [While security studies were traditionally dominated
by paradigmatic approaches many scholars have **[problematized]{.mark}**
such a rigid fixation on [**grand theories** and]{.mark} a **[positivist
epistemology]{.mark}**. [In particular]{.mark} the **[liberal]{.mark}**
accounts on NATO's taken-for-granted identity and its normative
attractiveness as a **democratic alliance**, as well as [**realist** and
**institutionalist** explanations]{.mark} of NATO's likely or unlikely
continuity]{.underline} (Risse-Kappen, 1995, 1996; Wallander 2000,
Waltz, 1990), were targeted [as expressions of a [**rationalist fixation
on causation** and **macro-structural phenomena**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Hellmann, 2006; Sjursen, 2004; Jackson, 2003). [[**Identities**,
**interests**, and **threats**]{.mark}, however, [**neither**
signify]{.mark} distinct [**causes and effects** **nor**]{.mark} do they
[describe **static objects one could**]{.mark} **easily
'[observe]{.mark}'**; [they are **constructed
inter-subjectively**]{.mark} and they are only meaningful in the sense
that people make use of references to 'identities', 'interests', and
'threats' in specific ways]{.underline} (Weldes et al., 1998, p. 13;
Wæver 1995, p. 55; Jackson, 2006, chapter 2; Bially Mattern, 2005, p.
92). For critical constructivists, therefore, all our knowledge about
social facts is dependent on communicative processes where people
produce meaning and knowledge through the practical usage of language
(Guzzini, 2005, p. 498).

Critical constructivist and [**poststructuralist** approaches are
interested]{.underline}, in particular, [in understanding these
discursive practices]{.underline} -- i.e. how people make sense of their
worlds, [how they create and mobilize a common identity or threat
assessment and how such references unfold institutional
consequences]{.underline}. While some critics have argued that
constructivists might underestimate material conditions of power, a
critical approach takes power quite seriously (Guzzini, 2005; Bially
Mattern, 2006; Barnett and Duvall, 2000). Despite a material fixation on
capabilities, the concept of power in critical constructivism indicates
'the realm of political action and its justification' (Guzzini, 2005, p.
508), including the institutional consequences made possible by these
acts. Power, then, is part of distinct discourses understood as symbolic
orders which constrain and enable what can be meaningfully said (Doty,
1996, p. 6; Hansen, 2006, p. 19). While discourse approaches pose the
most forceful challenge to more traditional approaches in security
studies, scholars occasionally overemphasize the macro-structural level
of symbolic orders in general and the disciplinary power of discourses
in particular. However, it is always the practical invocation,
mobilization, and transformation of structures of signification whereby
people make sense of their world and justify why they act the way they
do (cf. Jackson, 2006, p. 15; Tilly, 2006; Boltanski and Thevenot,
2006). [An **assumed 'shared' identity between North America and
Europe**, composed of historical, social, and normative patterns of
interaction, is nothing but the actualization of a common discourse
where **'the West'** figures as a **powerful yet notoriously vague
signifier**]{.underline}.

Bearing these arguments of critical constructivist approaches in mind,
[it is of **central interest**, then, **how NATO** is 'able to
**mobilize** its longstanding **identity** as the expression and
**military guarantor of Western civilization**' closely connected to the
**democratic** and **capitalist** bonds among its member
countries]{.underline} (Neumann and Williams, 2000, p. 361; italics
added). It goes without saying that [a **common threat
perception**]{.underline} during the heydays of the Cold War has
tightened these bonds. [However, it **does not explain how Western
security cooperation was made possible in the first place and why it
lasted for over 60 years**, including the phase of detente ´ in the
1970s. Hence, [the **key shortcoming**]{.mark} of **realist**,
**liberal**, and **institutionalist** approaches to **NATO** [is]{.mark}
that [they **take**]{.mark} **the actor's [articulations of threats and
interests at face value]{.mark}**, while [a **critical approach directs
our attention to how actors invoke**]{.mark} **threats, interest, and
identities [and]{.mark} to [what]{.mark} kind of [institutional
consequences are made possible]{.mark}** by these acts]{.underline}
(Klein, 1990, p. 315, p. 317; Jackson, 2003, p. 224).

Such a perspective on the usage of concepts and their meaning is
interested in the ways and forms of inscribing plots, characters,
relations, and motives for action. As Trine Flockhart (2012, p. 80)
writes, '\[n\]arratives describe the history, purpose and achievements
of a collective entity such as NATO, and they contribute in the process
towards its unity and facilitate its continuous transformation'. These I
will call foundational narratives. Foundational refers to two related
aspects characteristic of most political narratives: first, it directs
our attention to the justifications why something exists. In NATO's case
this refers to the justifications mobilized by the allies in order to
found and keep an 'alliance', i.e. to construct meaningful stories about
what 'NATO' is and how its past, present, and future are to be
described. Foundational narratives are answers to 'why'- questions --
questions such as 'why do we still need NATO?'. Second, the term
'foundational' emphasizes the taken-for-grantedness of these narratives.
Narratives are foundational when they restore unity in the light of
(more or less) serious 'identity crises' where constructions of common
representations appear as problematic. References to a 'global war on
terrorism', for example, where military intervention and preemption is
articulated as necessary, altered the organizational design of NATO in
many ways. Within these discursive patterns the continuing relevance of
a transatlantic alliance was never really questioned, irrespective of
whether NATO was defined as a system of collective defense or a forum
for political consultation. Understood in this way, foundational
narratives are powerful and consequential in the sense that they enable
and constrain the re-constitution of political subjects.

Foundational **[[narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}** come in different
forms. In this chapter I argue that they [[**materialize in NATO's
strategic documents** where]{.mark} the allies [agree on]{.mark} a
highly symbolic assurance of their mutual trust and **[shared
identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They frequently **invoke a common
purpose**, **mobilize a [shared threat assessment]{.mark}**, and
rearticulate a collective defense assurance]{.underline} as laid down in
Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. Official strategic concepts
during the Cold War included M.C. 3 (1949), M.C. 14/2 known as 'massive
retaliation' (1957), and M.C. 14/3 known as 'flexible response' (1968)
and were accompanied by more detailed strategic guidance and planning
documents. In the 1990s, NATO's strategic concept became an issue of
public declaration, symbolized by the Alliance's 'New Strategic Concept'
(1991) and its follow-up documents in 1999 -- NATO's fiftieth birthday
-- and 2010. All strategic concepts reflected changing security
perceptions and restored the unity of the alliance by codifying
onestrategy. In the late 1940s/early 1950s, the foundations for a
transatlantic alliance were laid down in the North Atlantic Treaty and
the following strategic concepts and guidance. Forty years later, the
dissolution of the Soviet Union made a public revision of NATO's
strategy necessary in order to re-orient the alliance after the 'end of
the Cold War' had been declared. Although many commentators doubted that
NATO would survive this period of transformation, the alliance counts
twenty-eight members today and seems to be 'very much in business', as
former General Secretary Manfred Worner once stated.1

2 The Formation of the Transatlantic Alliance and the Beginning of the
Cold War

When tensions between the Western powers and the Soviet Union
intensified after the defeat of Nazi Germany, the formalization of a
transatlantic alliance was perceived as an obligation to counter and
deter an apparent Eastern threat.2 The purpose of the alliance, NATO's
first Secretary General Lord Ismay has often been cited as saying, was
'to keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down'. While
France and Britain, the driving forces behind the initiative to form a
military alliance, strongly called for a lasting presence of the US in
European affairs, the Truman administration, supported by isolationist
sentiments in Congress, had more reservations about pursuing such a
project (Kaplan, 1999, pp. 7--28; Osgood, 1962).3 Most controversial was
the issue of military assistance. While the US government preferred a
nonbinding and declaratory formulation, French diplomat Armand Berard ´
and British diplomat Sir Frederic Hoyer-Millar, both delegates to the so
called exploratory talks, insisted on a reliable and forceful assurance
of US military assistance (Kaplan, 1999, p. 16--17). When the Truman
government drafted a compromise formula, US objections to a formalized
alliance were overcome. In a memo to President Truman in 1948, his
advisor Clark Clifford remarked that the preamble of a transatlantic
declaration should make clear that 'the main object of the instrument
would be to preserve western civilization in the geographical area
covered by the agreement'.4

The North Atlantic Treaty, signed on 4 April 1949 by ten Western
European states, the US, and Canada, outlined the principles of the new
alliance -- consultation (Article 4) and collective defense (Article 5)
-- and called for the development of an organizational structure
(Article 9). The preamble of the treaty states:

The parties to this Treaty reaffirm their faith in the purpose and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations and their desire to live
in peace with all peoples and governments. They are determined to
safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their
peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and
the rule of law. They seek to promote stability and well-being in the
North Atlantic area. (North Atlantic Treaty, 1949; italics added)

The contractual language ('parties', 'Treaty') of the preamble
postulated a community based on shared principles as laid out in the
Charter of the United Nations and closely linked to democracy, liberty,
and the rule of law. In the late 1940s such an equivalence between these
principles and the North Atlantic area is not surprising given the
overall perception of a clash between antagonistic identity
constructions, a 'free world' on the one side and 'communism' on the
other side. However, the preamble included a puzzling formulation: it
assumes that a community of likemined states is already in existence due
to the act of 're-affirming' a common faith expressed in another legal
document, the Charter of the United Nations, as well as 're-affirming' a
shared desire to live in peace. Such a community is then explicated by
referring to freedom, common heritage, and civilization as well as
principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law. All
these signifiers have, for some time, commonly been associated with 'the
West'. Here NATO materializes as an actualization of an already existing
community, not as a newly created military alliance. Hence, NATO was
justified as the means to promote stability and well-being between the
contracting parties instead of a goal in itself.

While many commentators would presume that NATO is the institutional
core of what we commonly call 'the West', the term itself is
surprisingly absent in the North Atlantic Treaty and the following
strategic concepts. The central subject of every strategic document
during the Cold War is the 'North Atlantic treaty area', specified as
the defense of 'America and Europe' (North Atlantic Treaty, Article 5).
The name to be given to the institutionalized security cooperation
between the US and their Western European allies was of central concern
for both sides. While the foreign ministers of France and Britain,
Bidault and Bevin, preferred a 'European' title for the treaty, US
delegates refused such a narrowly defined subject. The ''North
Atlantic', which developed as a compromise, symbolized a geographic and
political bond which connected the US, Europe, and some geostrategically
important members such as Portugal and Iceland (Kaplan, 2004, p. 30).
The insistence of the Truman administration on integrating Canada,
Portugal (Azores Islands), and Iceland also pleased those isolationists
in the US Congress who rejected NATO as a 'European' alliance (Kaplan,
2004, p. 33p). The goal of containing communism made it even possible to
include an autocratic member such as Portugal, which hardly counted as a
reliable candidate for 'safeguarding the freedom of their people', as
one of the preamble states.

Invoking the alliance primarily as a loosely defined geopolitical entity
signaled a willingness to distance oneself from the specific political
circumstances in 1948/49. It united the geographic and political project
of a 'Western' alliance between North America and (Western) Europe.
While the term 'area' evoked associations of space and territory, the
boundaries of this entity remained rather vague due to the geographical
fuzziness of the 'North Atlantic' (Franke, 2010).5 How the notion of a
'North Atlantic area' is used within NATO's strategic concepts,
nevertheless, illustrates a crucial point. By reading NATO's strategic
concepts, one gets the impression that such an 'area' -- however
materially and ideationally unbounded it may remain -- is not defended
against a specific, identifiable threat but is constructed as a
political space with various social and cultural relations worthy of
being secured in a broad sense. The treaty title and preamble do not
primarily mobilize a military purpose but a notion of geopolitical unity
and durability to be taken for granted.

Despite the imagination of an already existing and geopolitically
bounded community, NATO is generally described as a system of collective
defense. For most Western European states, Article 5 formalized the
(military) assistance of its transatlantic partner and the economic
support of the US government to rebuild Western Europe as well as to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. Military
assistance, though, was not inscribed as a necessity; rather it was
invoked with a strong notion of solidarity:

The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in
Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all
and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each
of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective
self-defense recognised by Article 51 of the Charter of the United
Nations, will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking
forthwith, individually and in concert with the other Parties, such
action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to
restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. (Article
5, North Atlantic Treaty, 1949; italics added)

Article 5 was perceived as a 'pledge' made by the US to defend their
Western European allies who were alarmed by the superior number of
Soviet conventional forces.6 Framing this pledge in terms of a mutual
assurance of assistance implied a strong symbol of solidarity. The
compromise formula that active assistance would not be an automatic
demand pleased all sides due to the different interpretations it made
possible. For the US Congress, the strongest opponent of the
'entanglement' of the US with a European alliance, it expressed the
freedom of choice isolationists insisted on. For Western European
states, Article 5 confirmed the solidarity and military assistance of US
conventional and in particular nuclear forces if such assistance would
become necessary.

Article 5 is mostly seen as the source of collective defense. Its
consequences, though, were ambivalent: on the one hand, it expressed the
defensive purpose of the alliance ('restore'); on the other hand, it
made possible a policy of planning, preparation, and precaution in order
to 'maintain the security of the North Atlantic area' (emphasis added).
In relation to the geopolitical imagination of a community, regional
defense planning was one central institutional consequence which
constituted NATO as a military as well as political enterprise. Although
Article 5 is mostly seen as the 'heart' of NATO, it was only in
combination with Article 4 (consultation) and Article 9 (Council) that
an integrated military command structure, the standardization and
modernization of forces, and even a common nuclear policy developed so
quickly. Through the invocation of this geopolitical community of
solidarity, NATO transformed into a military organization and assured
the presence of US forces in Europe.

During the formative years of the alliance this foundational narrative
of a geopolitical community of solidarity was consolidated in the
strategic concepts and guidance via a clear distinction between the
'Western allies' on the one hand and the 'Soviet Union' with its
satellites on the other. NATO's first strategic concept -- at least the
first document entitled 'strategic concept' available in the archives --
was drafted in October 1949 and intended to 'ensure unity of thought and
purpose' as stated on the cover page (M.C. 3; Wheeler, 2001, p. 123;
Pedlow, 1997).7 The kind of community imagined by the signatories put
strong emphasis on unity understood in a broad sense. As a highly
confidential and mandatory text, the strategic concept authorized the
national executives and the intergovernmental committees of NATO to take
any measure in order to provide for the defense of the North Atlantic
area. The integration of 'political, economic, and psychological as well
as purely military means' was articulated as a central requirement for
efficient defense. Deterrence and, if necessary, collective defense were
set up as a core strategy of prevention and preparation. Hence, the
insignia of the Allied Command Europe reads 'vigilance is the price of
liberty'.

Key to the implementation of the defense concept was to '\[i\]nsure the
ability to deliver the atomic bomb promptly' as the primary
responsibility of the US government and the strategy of 'forward
defense'. The main purpose of NATO was to effectively coordinate and
integrate collective defense planning in order to 'unite the strength of
the North Atlantic Treaty nations'. This [policy [included]{.mark} the
**[standardization of military doctrines]{.mark}**, **combined [training
exercises]{.mark}**, **[exchange of intel]{.mark}**ligence information,
and 'cooperation in the construction, maintenance and operation of
military installations of mutual concern']{.underline}. M.C. 3, however,
invoked neither a strong concept of 'the West' nor a clear description
of an 'Eastern threat'. It referred to 'the enemy' only as an abstract
source of insecurity and uncertainty

The strategic concept and every subsequent revision of it are
accompanied by guidelines for strategic planning. The first official
strategic guidance in 1950, M.C. 14, emphasized 'the necessity for
developing methods to compensate for numerical inferiority' compared to
Soviet (conventional) forces.8 Entitled as a 'directive', regional
planning groups, NATO's core institutional structure in the 1950s, were
authorized to develop 'detailed regional defense plans which . . . will
ensure the unity of defense of the North Atlantic Treaty nations'. Until
1 July 1954 NATO member states were instructed to implement a medium
term defense plan 'for building up the overall military capabilities of
the North Atlantic Treaty nations'. NATO allies should be prepared for
'war' with the Soviet Union, which had 'maintained, if not increased,
her technical, military and economic capabilities'. Anticipating a
potential war with the Soviet Union, NATO's military planning was
justified as an act of defense which was based on several 'assumptions'
about Soviet intentions, for example '\[t\]hat the USSR will initiate
air attacks on the North Atlantic Treaty nations in Europe and the
Western Hemisphere' (italics added). The Soviet Union was invoked as an
expansionist and aggressive adversary with stronger and larger
conventional forces than those of the Western allies. Therefore, a
common nuclear policy was justified as the primary mean to prevent war.
It symbolically marked the beginning of the Cold War when assessments of
'Western' and 'Eastern' alignment invented a global conflict with mainly
two competing ideological camps.

NATO's defense policy, as stated in M.C. 14, was based on a distinction
between peace-time and war-time as two operational modes of security:

In peacetime the objectives of the defense policy of the North Atlantic
Treaty powers are to convince the USSR that war does not pay, and,
should war occur, to insure a successful defense of the North Atlantic
area. This policy requires the development of adequate military strength
and a close coordination of the political, economic and psychological
efforts of member nations. (M.C. 14, 1950; italics added)

[Effective deterrence and collective defense 'required' [**military
modernization** and **political coordination**]{.mark}. Hence, as a
geopolitical community of solidarity, **NATO** was **re-constituted** as
a **military** and **political** enterprise, including **economic** and
**psychological** efforts. It [**re-affirmed a sense of 'Western
we-ness'** which **reached far beyond the specific historical**]{.mark}
circumstances of responding to a]{.underline} Soviet
[**[threat]{.mark}** and developed a comprehensive approach to security.
Deterrence and precaution were only two sides of the same coin, namely
securing 'the West']{.underline}.

The continuing debates between the NATO allies in the early 1950s
centered on questions of effective defense planning, deterrence, and
nuclear policy. A 'Report by the Military Committee on the most
effective pattern of NATO military strength for the next few years' in
1954 (M.C. 48) explicated the concept of 'massive retaliation' including
a 'forward defense' of Europe on West German territory (Kaplan, 2004, p.
63f., 80f.; Kugler, 1993, p. 101). It formalized the 'New Look policy'
of US president Eisenhower, the former SACEUR, in order to guarantee an
economically efficient deterrence (Trachtenberg, 1992). US nuclear air
capacities were the cornerstone of 'massive retaliation', NATO's
strategic concept until 1968. The nuclearization of the alliance gave
the European member states a strong voice in the development of a common
nuclear strategy and shifted the 'balance of power within NATO' in the
1960s from the USA to European member states (Tuschhoff, 1999, p. 159).
Self/other depictions culminated in a stylized presentation of a
monolithic Soviet system on the one hand and a democratic alliance on
the other hand:

The Soviet political system, with its power of immediate decision and
its advantage of strict security, as compared with the free and
democratic system of the NATO type which must obtain decisions through
group action, provides an initial advantage of great importance in
achieving surprise. (M.C. 48, 1954; italics added)

While the Soviet Union held the advantage of surprise, Western allies
were convinced that they had only one choice: nuclear planning. [The
prevention of war, in particular the 'overrun of Europe']{.underline} by
Soviet conventional forces, [**[legitimized]{.mark}** effective
**[deterrence based on]{.mark} a numerical and qualitative [superiority
in nuclear capacities]{.mark}** which had to be integrated in
the]{.underline} so-called forces in being, i.e. [forces being held in a
state of readiness]{.underline}. The enclosure, the most confidential
part of M.C. 48, listed those measures 'necessary to increase the
deterrent and defensive value of NATO forces': integrated atomic
capabilities, early warning and alert systems, a German contribution to
'forces in being', and measures to ensure the survival of NATO forces
after a Soviet first strike. NATO's forward defense strategy, including
the Rhine-Ijssel line, made a military contribution of Germany even more
necessary and provided an early justification for a German membership
(cf. Jackson 2006).

In the next 35 years, NATO had to weather turbulent times of ups and
downs: the Suez crisis in 1956, the withdrawal of France from the
integrated military command structure in 1966, the invocation of
flexible response as the new strategic concept in 1968, the policy of
detente in the 1970s, NATO's controversial double-track decision in
1979, and the changing political constellations in the Soviet Union
beginning with Gorbachev's reform policies in the mid-1980s. The list of
crises and renewed routines, however, is much longer and certainly one
reason why research on NATO, its histories and policies, characterized
security studies for many decades. With the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, a re-orientation of the alliance seemed to be necessary, even
inevitable in order to explicate why NATO should continue to exist.

3 The Re-orientation of the Alliance after the Cold War

With the announcement of Mikhail Gorbachev as General Secretary of the
Communist Party in 1985, Soviet 'new thinking' of transparency
(glasnost) and domestic reform (perestroika) tremendously changed the
established discursive patterns of self/other relations and threat
constructions. The London Declaration, following the NATO summit in July
1990, symbolically proclaimed the end of the Cold War, and the allies
invited the members of the Warsaw Pact to declare that 'we are no longer
adversaries'.9 With the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw
Pact in the early 1990s, most commentators expected that NATO's strategy
of flexible response, forward defense, and nuclear first strike
capabilities had lost its validity as well, even that the alliance would
suffer the same fate of disappearance (Waltz, 1990, 1993; Snyder, 1990;
Mearsheimer, 1990). Nevertheless, there seemed to be a strong consensus
between the member states that NATO should persist. For the allies,
[NATO still played a significant internal and external role: externally,
in preventing, containing, and controlling instabilities and militarized
conflicts in Central and Eastern Europe, including the neutralization of
a renewed Russian threat]{.underline} (Duffield, 1994, p. 767--70; see
also Pouliot, 2010); [internally, in providing an institutional
mechanism to overcome the classical security dilemma by practices of
reassurance, transparency, and de-nationalization of forces]{.underline}
(Duffield, 1994, p. 772--775; see also Adler, 2008).10

[While neorealists predicted a slow but inevitable decline of the
transatlantic alliance, a variety of institutionalist approaches
explained the looming continuity of the Atlantic alliance through
institutional adaption and its inherent political function]{.underline}
(Wallander, 2000, p. 717; Haftendorn, 1996; Duffield, 1994). [New
'partnership programs' evolved that were intended to 'persuade the
partners that learning the practices of a community of the like-minded
and coming to share an identity with its members will make them part of
this community']{.underline} (Adler, 2008, p. 207; see also Gheciu,
2005). Bearing these multiple assets and cooperative security practices
of NATO in mind, [new strategic concepts and military directives
[developed **hand in hand** with the **declaration of new**]{.mark}
**challenges and [missions]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the 1990s. While
previous strategic concepts had been highly confidential and drafted by
military experts within the alliance, the alliance's concepts in 1991,
1999, and 2010 were unclassified and -- in the case of the last concept
in 2010 -- the work of an appointed political expert group.11
[[Today]{.mark}, NATO's strategic concept represents a new kind of
**public diplomacy** which is **[primarily directed at national
publics]{.mark}** in order [to **explain why NATO should continue to
exist, expand, and intervene in conflicts**]{.mark} **far beyond the
'transatlantic area'**]{.underline}.

In 1991, shortly after the proclaimed end of the Cold War, the new
strategic concept was an expression of an unexpected crisis caused by
the rapid transformations in Europe (Kay, 1998, p. 61). The first years
of the 1990s were mainly experienced as a period of uncertainty
regarding the future direction of security relations between 'the East'
and 'the West'. Already the title of the new strategic concept
introduced the subject as a well-known entity, i.e. 'The Alliance's new
strategic concept'. The term 'Alliance', written in capital letters,
re-confirmed the positive connotations of the World War II alliance
against Hitler Germany and liberated Western security community from the
geographical notion of the 'Transatlantic'. Nevertheless, it coevally
reactivated the geopolitical connotation of former times by focusing
primarily on Europe's territorial and political transformation in the
East.

One central question the new strategic concept was intended to answer
was what aim the Atlantic alliance could serve in a world where a
territorial threat had ceased to exist for the better part. Turning away
from the depiction of a communist Soviet aggression of territorial
expansion, Europe's transformation was presented as the main referent
object of security, including a 'vision of Europe whole and free' (SC
1991). Clear distinctions of military and ideological alignment as
articulated in the early 1950s had disappeared; new but still uncertain
formations of political unity were developing. The strategic concept
therefore distinguished between the Soviet Union on the one hand, and
the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), the 'USSR's former
satellites' which 'have fully recovered their sovereignty' (SC 1991) on
the other hand. Because of political changes in 'the East', there were
also 'significant changes' in 'the West': German unification and the
development of a European security identity in the context of the
European Community. The document, however, articulated 'the West', now
explicitly named, as an expanding project which already expected to
incorporate CEE:

All the countries that were formerly adversaries of NATO have dismantled
the Warsaw Pact and rejected ideological hostility to the West. They
have, in varying degrees, embraced and begun to implement policies aimed
at achieving pluralistic democracy, the rule of law, respect for human
rights and a market economy. The political division of Europe that was
the source of the military confrontation of the Cold War period has thus
been overcome. (SC 1991, italics added)

The invention of CEE symbolically bridged the dissolution of the Eastern
bloc and opened a range of new political, diplomatic, but also military
relations for the Western allies with the former members of the Warsaw
Pact. NATO policies of dialogue and cooperation were created as
instruments of incorporation closely associated with notions such as
democracy, human rights, and market economy. Neumann (2001) argues that
the invention of the category CEE and how it was used by both sides was
quite important in order to open up the road for NATO's as well as EU's
eastern enlargement (see also Behnke, 2013; Schimmelfennig, 2003). Such
a split of the 'Eastern bloc' made it possible to conceive of the CEE as
being liberated from communist rule and returning to a democratic and
free Europe where the Cold War period and their association with Russia
seemed to be just a transitory coincidence. A geopolitical narrative was
once again mobilized in order to integrate Europe, 'whole and free',
into the Transatlantic community of solidarity.

The perception of a vanishing Eastern threat and the invention of the
CEE, however, also pushed for a revision of NATO's flexible response
strategy, including a justification of why NATO should persist at a time
when a major war was becoming ever more unlikely. The document
continues:

In contrast with the predominant threat of the past, the risks to Allied
security that remain are multi-faceted in nature and multi-directional
which makes them hard to predict and assess. NATO must be capable of
responding to such risks if stability in Europe and the security of
Alliance members are to be preserved. (SC 1991)

Such a diffuse presentation of 'risks' which are 'multi-faceted' and
'multidirectional' emphasized NATO's planning capabilities and a renewed
concept of precaution. In many ways, the focus on non-military
challenges 'dislodged the distinction between the possible and the
probable' (Williams, 2009, p. 1). While some scholars argue that
'\[r\]isk is becoming the operative concept of Western security' since
the 1990s (Rasmussen 2001, p. 285), it was only before the background of
NATO's existing planning capacities that such an invocation of risks
could be worked on. Already in the 1950s, the allies laid the foundation
for an institutional structure which was dominated by practices of
military and strategic planning and the management of different
scenarios of attack and defense. The allies planned in detail for a
prospective war in Europe if prevention would fail. This renewed and now
more explicit emphasis on risks and precaution highlighted the relevance
of Article 4:

Any armed attack on the territory of the Allies, from whatever
direction, would be covered by Articles 5 and 6 of the Washington
Treaty. However, Alliance security must also take account of the global
context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a
wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,
disruption of the flow of vital resources, and actions of terrorism and
sabotage. Arrangements exist within the Alliance for consultation among
the Allies under Article 4 of the Washington Treaty and, where
appropriate, coordination of their efforts including their responses to
such risks. (SC, 1991; italics added)

Internally, Article 5 guaranteed alliance solidarity and the
indivisibility of transatlantic security; externally, such an assurance
of military support was intended to deter a Soviet attack, e.g.
'convincing the USSR that war does not pay'. With the proclamation of an
end of the Cold War, the external function of Article 5 had to be
re-interpreted due to the invocation of new non-territorial risks and
challenges. In a world where classical inter-state wars and conflicts
were vanishing, deterrence was increasingly perceived as an
anachronistic strategy of the old times. 'However', as the new strategic
concept explicitly cautioned, dangers had not disappeared but turned
into more diffuse risks. The invocation of 'uncertainty' and 'risks'
thus strengthened Article 4 as a mechanism of political consultation and
initiated NATO's transformation towards enhanced practices of security
management.

Bearing this discursive shift from Article 5 to Article 4 in mind,
out-of-area missions were the most explicit expression of institutional
consequences, including new consultation and cooperation practices. The
rationale for non-article 5 and out-of-area missions, though, was
already inscribed in the 1950s when the strategic concept outlined that
'\[i\]n order to preserve peace and security in the NATO area, it is
essential that, without disregarding the security of the NATO area,
hostile Soviet influence in non-NATO regions is countered' (M.C. 14/2,
1957).12 NATO's active military engagement began when the Allied Mobile
Force (AMF), a small multinational force which was founded in 1960, was
deployed in the southeast of Turkey during the Gulf War in 1991. The
violent fragmentation of Yugoslavia in the following years was perceived
as a test case for providing regional stability and security. Hence, the
'Partnership for Peace' program initially originated as a 'Partnership
for Peacekeeping' (Wallander, 2000, p. 721). With the air strikes
against Serbia in 1999 and even more explicitly in reaction to the
attacks on 9/11, NATO's self-image as a defender of human rights
manifested its confirmed self-image as an 'alliance of democracies'.13

The new emphasis on 'political means', as stated in the strategic
concept in 1991, already relied on a wide conception of security,
including 'dialogue', 'cooperation', and 'collective defense' for the
purpose of 'protecting peace in a new Europe'. While the allies
distinguished between peacetime and wartime in the 1950s, a third
operational mode of security was now added: crisis. Peace should be
'protected', war should be 'prevented', and in the event of crisis NATO
forces should 'contribute to the management of such crises and their
peaceful resolution'. Combined with the invocation of new uncertainties
and risks, the notion of crisis helped to justify the development of
rapid reaction forces and multinational forces in order to prevent (or
at least contain) a crisis.

[[Compared to]{.underline}]{.mark} this [**[new emphasis]{.mark}** on
NATO's ability of crisis management, the **[fear of war still
loomed]{.mark}** in the back of any risks assessment]{.underline}. In
the light of uncertainties -- crisis, risks, and war -- the alliance had
to be prepared for anything. [**Nuclear forces**, therefore, **continued
to play a significant strategic and political role**]{.underline}:

The fundamental purpose of the nuclear forces of the Allies is
political: to preserve peace and prevent coercion and any kind of war. .
. Nuclear forces based in Europe and committed to NATO provide an
essential political and military link between the European and the North
American members of the Alliance. (SC 1991, italics added)

Strategically, nuclear forces signaled a posture of deterrence;
politically, they ensured the cohesion and unity of the allies despite
the material inequalities between the US and their European allies. US
nuclear forces stationed in Europe symbolized a strong political bond of
solidarity. [[While]{.mark} dialogue and **[cooperation]{.mark} in
uncertain times** were **[now the buzzword]{.mark}s** of a 'new world
order', this uncertainty about the future also **[provoked]{.mark} a
sense of insecurity and [an urge to be prepared for the worst]{.mark}**.
The **[continued stationing of nuclear forces]{.mark}** in Europe and
the development of multinational as well as rapid reaction forces **were
[a response to this uncertainty]{.mark}**. NATO's central message boiled
down to: 'we are prepared']{.underline}. This confidence in the
continued relevance of the alliance was newly inscribed in its
foundational narrative of a geopolitical community of solidarity which
now expanded geographically to the East and was functionally expanded
into a political community according to Article 4 of the Washington
Treaty.

This re-constitution of NATO continued through the strategic concepts of
1999 and 2010, solidifying these discursive shifts in several ways. Most
explicit is a strengthening of Article 4 and the political power of the
alliance, the global perspective on NATO's mission, and the functional
re-organization of the military command structure. While NATO's
foundational narrative of a geopolitical community of solidarity had
initially enabled a regionally organized military command structure
(regional planning groups, then SACEUR and SACLANT) as well as the
deployment of US nuclear forces in Europe, the appearance of new risks
and uncertainties beyond the realm of territorial defense in the 1990s
enabled a functional transformation: SACEUR became Allied Command for
Operations (ACO) and SACLANT became Allied Command Transformation (ACT).
While the old military structure symbolised the trans-Atlantic bond --
Supreme Allied Command Europe and Supreme Allied Command Atlantic -- the
new division between operations and transformations dissolved such a
narrow geographical representation. In this sense NATO re-constituted
itself as a Western global alliance, 'Western' in its identity and
global in its mission.

4 Conclusion

[**[Debates]{.mark}** over the future of **NATO** [**easily transform**
into]{.mark} debates about [whether **'Western civilization'**]{.mark}
and 'the West' as a whole [might be **in decline**]{.mark} or whether
they are the winner of]{.underline} the Cold War's **[ideological
battles]{.underline}** (cf. Huntington, 1993; Fukuyama, 1989). [Compared
to NATO, however, a **Western security community** seems to be quite
prosperous **despite continuing conflicts** between NATO
members]{.underline} (Cox, 2005; Pouliot, 2006). In this chapter I have
tried to show that [a **transatlantic alliance** was
**(re-)constituted** via the mobilization and **re-articulation** of
foundational **narratives** by the allies in order to **justify** the
**existence**, **continuity**, and **transformation** of
**NATO**]{.underline}. [Foundational narratives, then, **direct our
attention** exactly to the **politics of security and identity** where
**political subjects are formed in the first place** and help to
understand how security communities are constituted **instead of
postulating that they are already existing**]{.underline} (Adler and
Barnett 1998, p. 3; contrary: Deutsch et al., 1969).

In conclusion, I want to highlight how NATO's re-constitution relates to
the overall theme of this volume, 'the West'. It is not surprising that
NATO allies often referred to 'democracy', 'individual liberty', or 'the
rule of law' in order to justify NATO as a geo-political community of
solidarity with defensive and peaceful intentions. Accordingly, it is
not surprising that the Soviet Union was repeatedly accused of
modernizing its military capacities, harboring expansionist intentions,
and being an aggressive opponent in an ideological struggle between
'freedom' and 'communism'. This rather plain self/other construction,
however, was quickly modified in the early 1990s by declaring an 'end of
the Cold War', invoking the CEE as a distinct political subject, and by
focusing on new risks and challenges different from the past focus on
territorial defense. Moreover, NATO had 'gone global' in order to 'bring
stability to other parts of the world' (Daalder and Goldgeier, 2006, p.
105; Brzezinski, 2009).

While this global NATO is depicted as a result of changing security
politics, in particular as a consequence of a globalized terrorist
threat, [it is]{.underline} short-sighted [\[myopic\] to argue that
these transformations are merely a reaction to external
pressures]{.underline}. [Grand **[narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline}
about a 'Cold War' and a 'War on Terrorism' [are [as much]{.mark}
produced by a transatlantic security discourse [**intended to make sense
of the world** as]{.mark} they **[serve to justify political
decisions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It is a **moot question**
whether]{.mark} the **global [projection of power by 'the West' caused
violent opposition]{.mark}** around the globe [or whether **'new
wars'**]{.mark}]{.underline} and terror networks such as Al Qaida
**[[caused a transformation of NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is
puzzling, though, that NATO has managed to secure its survival and to
transform. I have argued that [the creation and repetition of
foundational **narratives** -- in particular the **invention of a
geopolitical community of solidarity**]{.underline} and a political
community according to Article 4 of the Washington Treaty -- [made such
a two-sided re-constitution of continuity and transformation possible.
This also implies that NATO will persist and at once change as long as
the allies carry on re-articulating this foundational
narrative]{.underline}.

[Such a foundational **[narrative serves its integrating function only
against the background of 'the West' as]{.mark} a shared yet
[unspecified]{.mark} signifier**, which is **implicitly represented as a
threatened [referent]{.mark} object [of security]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
['Europe', the 'transatlantic area', respectively 'the West' are the
endangered subjects of NATO's strategic discourse
**[justifying]{.mark}** a durable and institutionally dense **[military
coop]{.mark}eration** of its member states [and]{.mark} a
**[nuclearization]{.mark}** of its defense strategy]{.underline}.
[Whenever allies pursued (national) security policies without
consultation, conflicts and crisis within the alliance were foreseeable.
It was [**only through NATO** that **'the West'** could
**utilize**]{.mark} **its [power]{.mark} position** [through]{.mark} a
specific form of **[self-authorization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [NATO,
respectively Western states, [presented **'democracy'**]{.mark}, 'human
rights', the **['rule of law']{.mark}**, [and **'market economy'** as
**normatively unquestioned** principles]{.mark} they had **[already
realized]{.mark}**. [**Others** had **only one choice:**]{.mark} to
[**comply** or]{.mark} to **[resist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The
**normative attractiveness of 'the West'**]{.mark}, thus, [also implies
the temptations of **self-authorizing**]{.mark} and **securitizing**
practices [where **a culture of legal formalism is
marginalized**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wæver, 1995; Koskenniemi, 2001).
[Yet 'Others' might only be known as defectors to a Western project of
modernization and democracy]{.underline}.

After two decades of academic and political debate about NATO's growing
irrelevance and likely or unlikely dissolution, the military escalation
on the Crimean peninsula and in Eastern Ukraine has definitely revived
the alliance. Some commentators even predict the dawn of a new Cold War
based on well-known patterns of enmity between 'the West' and 'the
East'. This is not the place to reflect on the current political
situation and its impact on NATO's future. Given its history, however,
NATO General Secretary Stoltenberg's recent remark should be taken
seriously that 'one of our greatest strengths is our ability to adapt'.

Thinking of **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** in terms of survival has
mostly meant to reflect on the Alliance's capacity to adapt to change.
It is undeniable, the Alliance [has proved to be **[adapting
continuously]{.mark}**; not only has it managed to transform itself in
face of structural change, as it has also **[transform]{.mark}ed [the
contexts in which it operates]{.mark}**, and **led the way to normative
evolutions** in the field of **international security** [as a
**self-proclaimed agent of change**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[**[Simultaneously]{.mark}**, NATO has also managed to **[keep some
things timeless]{.mark}** and unchanged, [through **recurrent**]{.mark}
and persisting [**narratives** displaying]{.mark} the different shades
of [its **civilisational purpose**]{.mark}. In line [with a logic of
**linear progress**]{.mark} and constant improvement, the Alliance has
remained aware of **temporality**, which it represents in very open and
**symbolic terms**. In this sense, **NATO** belongs to, and **feeds
itself upon**, the very **narratives** on Modernity [that Critical
Theory seeks to **deconstruct**]{.mark}]{.underline}. NATO is thus a
historical and ideological product of Modernity.

But survival is also the matter of people. Amidst the permanence of
change, as events and social phenomena emerge, evolve, or disappear, the
importance of living, sentient, organisms cannot be dismissed, hence the
need to individualise the very approach of civilisation in relation to
security. By conceptualising the Civilised Subject of Security, it
becomes possible to cope with the complex relations connecting the
individuals' sense of identity, their perception of security, and
broader social processes associated with the idea of civilisation. With
the Civilised Subject of Security, [different **[connections]{.mark}**
are established and **[converge:]{.mark}** social cognition,
sociological processes, behavioural transformations, [**power
relations**, **symbolic representations**, and **psychological
needs**]{.mark}. All together, these connections help picturing how [the
**Civilised Subject of Security**]{.mark} has been [in the
**West**]{.mark} **across time[:]{.mark}** [a **self-restrained
individual** who **looks**]{.mark} **up [to the state]{.mark}** in
search [for the]{.mark} **symbolic [representations necessary]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} his **[[feel]{.mark}ing of
[secur]{.mark}ity]{.underline}**. Throughout the last five centuries,
[civilised subjects of the West [have grown on]{.mark} the sense of
certainty and **naturalness** those **symbolic connections**
unconsciously provide them. As they **cumulated** this **assurance**
within their collective learning process, they **[cumulated symbolic
power]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} were able to impose upon and [**dominate
non-Western Otherness** with the]{.mark} actual [belief that]{.mark}
behavioural and social **[norms from the West could only be
beneficial]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The West built upon that belief and
that **symbolic capital** to assemble the preliminary system of
**international security** that]{.underline} basically [ensured that
Westerners would be secure outside the West, which included the liberty
to believe and behave as they did in the West]{.underline}. All of this
also contributed to the cumulated security experience of the West
through time, so it has come to be comprised in the civilised habitus of
Westerners, as part of their unconscious history. [What]{.underline} the
existence of [the unconscious structures of human mind
suggest]{.underline} in this book [is that the perceptions and
representations of security are **[not]{.mark} the fruit of [a
conscious]{.mark} or voluntary [choice of practices and
meanings]{.mark}** by the subjects, but **[rather the result of]{.mark}
domination, [disciplining]{.mark}** and]{.underline} [**exclusionary
practices**, long-term processes of **inculcation**, [and
**symbol**]{.mark}**ic suggestion[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That, in
addition to the process of civilisation from the West,
[[suggests]{.mark} that **[the security of some cannot be the security
of all]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The defence of Western civilisation had a central role in NATO's
original formulation of its referent object of security. In line with
the general claim of this book that the civilisation of the West is not
a natural, spontaneous or innate idea when conceiving international
security, Chap. 5 showed that WWII made Western powers redefine the
rules allowing the habitus of the Civilised Subjects of Security to be
corrected and resumed. [The **civilised habitus** of the
**West**]{.underline} suffered a major breakdown because of WWII, but it
[was **revived** through]{.underline} different concepts and
[**symbols** such as **democracy**]{.underline} and spirituality,
[and]{.underline} through [the **representation** of a specific
stereotyped **barbarian Other**---the **Soviet Union**]{.underline}. The
fundamental beliefs of Westerners about how civilised they really were,
or about how uncivilised they could be, were strongly disrupted, which
required a reassertion of justifications and symbolic meanings, in order
to continue with the civilised habitus. The symbolic capital of the West
had been destabilised as a consequence of both world wars, and needed
reassurance. In this sense, NATO's civilisational referent of security
composes a fundamental part of its identity, a foundational principle,
an original meaning.

By analysing the first four decades of NATO's life in those terms, Chap.
6 also showed that a sense of identity and purpose has always been a
pressing issue since the beginning of the Alliance. Although NATO's
organisational and identity crisis have been profusely analysed in
reference to the post-Cold War period, matters of survival, pertinence,
and projection into the long-term future were an important part of
NATO's narrative early in its existence. In a way that is indeed aware
of temporality and future, NATO has associated a historical Atlantic
identity with long-lasting purposes that expand beyond mere military
functions of defence. The short-term, event-related, dimension of WWII
was overthrown by NATO's interplay with longer temporal references,
which has also influenced its civilisational referent of security. Not
only has NATO evolved in an open way because it is part of a
long-duration structural time, as civilisation has also been represented
and projected into the long-term future as part of a "common destiny",
ascribing a sense of linearity and timelessness to the very idea of
civilisation. The initial significance of the civilisational referent
was sustained throughout the 1950s and 1960s, and the idea of
civilisational unity was even reclaimed, as more integration, or
interdependence, was demanded by Western elites. The civilised habitus
of the West was still on the process of reassurance, because the
perception of security was not definite, or stabilised. As the 1970s
brought strong ideological criticism to the West, civilisation became
more discrete in NATO's discourses. Instead, the Organisation's values
and usefulness were persistently reaffirmed by referring to symbols of
security and memories, fed by the references to past achievements and
glory. But it also adapted conceptually, to include issues such as
poverty and underdevelopment, thereby expanding the Alliance's
competences.

The new structural era that opened with the end of the Cold War provided
NATO with many opportunities to dominate the new architecture of
international security. Across the 1990s, this was operated on two
interrelated levels simultaneously. One occurred with a political and
institutional reinvention centred on new ways of relating to non-members
and to potentially new ones, by gradually assimilating them into the
Alliance's narrative about collective security and identity. In both
cases, this process entailed conditioned socialising practices and
learning processes that increased interdependence and regularised
behaviour according to democratic standards, so that NATO's new partners
and members would be ultimately perceived as civilised, but would also
behave as such.

The final development of the argument suggested that intervening to
protect individuals in out-of-area countries is not a natural or
spontaneous evolution of NATO neither. This is rather part of a careful
reinvention after the Cold War that is entrenched in broader
conjunctural changes, but that is still inscribed in the continuity of
NATO's narrative about change. The end of the Cold War left plenty room
for the redefinition of a civilisational order; every belief,
relationship, practice, justification, or stereotype of the preceding
fifty years either ceased to be relevant, or needed to be rethought. In
the new conjunctural context of the 1990s, multi-polarity was still
virtual. Rules and practices were expected to transform, because the
locus of symbolic power was now uncertain. At a deeper level, as Robert
W. Cox (2002: 76) puts it, the assumptions upon which prevailing forms
of knowledge were based were challenged, and a different set of problems
arose to be confronted. During the Cold War, two competing forms of
homogenisation were the only games allowed. In the search for a new
basis of knowledge, a new ontology of world order needed to be found
that allowed "\[p\]erceiving the historical structures that characterize
an epoch" (Cox, 2002: 78). Although it seemed Capitalism, Liberalism and
democracy had won over Soviet Communism, the post-Cold War period also
liberated societies from old constraints, and could have represented a
critical opportunity for renovating a world order based on enhanced
multicultural dialogue as the "obscured diversity of the human
situation" (Cox, 2002: 77) was suddenly more apparent. However, that
period opened a latent ideological struggle for defining the rules that
would dominate from then on. Rules and practices changed, because other
elements transpired and rose above those of the previous period.

But the main post-Cold War conjunctural change in the field of
international security during the 1990s was presented in Chap. 8 as
consisting of [the Individualisation of Security, a normative process
through which Western civilisation could be upheld and
continued]{.underline}. [**NATO** has been a **major actor** in that
process, as it **strove** and managed **to be very influential** in
**prescribing and putting in practice** the **new rules and practices**
of the Individualisation of Security]{.underline}. The main
[findings]{.underline} regarding the Individualisation of Security
[suggested that the **valuation of individuals** when formulating
**security policies**]{.underline}, or deciding to intervene militarily
in third sovereign states, [has particular political and ideological
stances related to the **maintenance of the status quo** and world
order, **[empowering]{.mark}** in fact [the **agency of international
organisations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The positive connotation of the
Individualisation of Security as a system of values can be seen as [a
way [to **justify** and **sustain** **biopolitical arguments**]{.mark}
and practices [destined to **control and contain human
life**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The preliminary relationship between the
Individualisation of Security and the civilising process was set in
terms of an apparent rise of a cosmopolitan consciousness whereby the
interdependence between individuals make states or groups of states to
act in territories other than their own, in a sort of decentralising
process of the original monopolistic state. The Individualisation of
Security thus implies a transformation of behaviour in both men and
states in international society, mostly through the inculcation of
responsibility, and through the establishment of new boundaries for
appropriate behaviour regarding individuals. The Individualisation of
Security [also produced an international discourse of discipline and
normalisation, whereby a conduct that is respective of individuals
should be natural for all states]{.underline}.

[The Individualisation of Security constitutes another stage of the
civilising process because it has expanded the civilised habitus to
non-Western spaces, by normalising the rationale for military
intervention, and by transforming the beliefs and behaviours about
security]{.underline}. [In BH and Kosovo, that rationale was articulated
in terms of NATO's ethical responsibility to intervene in defence of
civilians, mostly ethnic minorities, victims of barbarian practices such
as ethnic cleansing]{.underline}. The Individualisation of Security thus
contributed to NATO's civilisational narrative in both those nonmember
countries, through discourses representing a geopolitics of morality,
through barbarian analogies and comparisons. They represented local time
and space as stagnated entities, in contrast with the timelessness of
the Alliance's values and moral authority. They also employed memory
discourses referring to WWII and the Holocaust, powerful features of the
Alliance's symbolic capital.

The Individualisation of Security as practised and performed by NATO is
consistent with its original civilisational referent, for the security
of the North-Atlantic area and wider ideological and normative influence
have been upheld. But ultimately, it also transformed the dominant
perceptions and fundamental beliefs of the twentieth century on war.
[From an aberration, failure and deviation of the civilised subjects,
the justifications and memories of wars like those of BH, Kosovo or
Afghanistan are likely to remain in the future as protective wars
destined to secure innocent human lives from barbarian ideologies,
either from the West, or from the non-West]{.underline}. This could be
[at the origin of how meanings of security can be unconsciously (and
erroneously) shaped]{.underline}.

Throughout the operations, the importance of NATO's public speeches and
justificatory discourse decreased. The initial mediatisation of Bosnia
and Kosovo might have corresponded to an initial normalising phase, in
which the effort to inform and shape public awareness was stronger. In
each of the three interventions, behaviour change was a major objective,
ultimately aimed at another interrelated goal: regime change. For that,
psychological operations were put in practice through different
approaches destined to induce behavioural transformations, such as radio
and television broadcasts or air-dropped leaflets. With the
Individualisation of Security, [humanitarian and **biopolitical
concerns** mixed, and produced discourses **framing** each of these
**countries as spaces of behavioural duality**, where **barbarism** was
always the **original problem**, and **civilisation** **only possible
under certain controlled circumstances** and standards]{.underline}.
Whereas BH and Kosovo's [barbarism]{.underline} was [represented in
terms of a demonized leader and of **essentialist ethno-political
stereotypes**]{.underline}, Afghanistan's barbarism was [associated to
both the **possibility of terrorist insurgency** and more basic
**battles of perceptions** focusing on binary perceptions of **amity
versus enmity**, security versus insecurity]{.underline}, terrorist
activities versus inactivity. In each case, [**NATO's justifications**,
narrative on change and overall discourse on civilisation]{.underline}
were very [often **[framed within binaries of civilised and uncivilised
behaviour]{.mark}**, denoting the continual influence of
Logocentrism]{.underline} under Modernity, [as a hegemonic system of
representing the world]{.underline}. [The **consequence**]{.underline}
of Logocentrism is, as Richard Ashley suggested (1989), [that
hierarchical meanings are imposed regarding the non-members of the
Alliance, and the **non-Western world** more widely]{.underline}. In
this sense, [**[all that NATO does not consider civilised]{.mark}**
within international security---**[identities]{.mark}, practices,
behaviour, [norms]{.mark}**---[is conceived as]{.mark} an essential
**political [deviation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The **consequences** of this]{.mark} limiting **[form of]{.mark}
thinking and [representing the world]{.mark}** are quite disturbing, for
they **[enhance]{.mark} and revive [the global potential for
war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Vivienne Jabri (2007) actually speaks of [a
"**global matrix of war**" that is now [**constituted** of two]{.mark}
dominant [sets of]{.mark} practices; one includes the **[wars fought in
the name of humanity]{.mark}**, [legitimised by **discourses**]{.mark}
**centred [on care]{.mark}, rescue, [and]{.mark} human rights** (as in
Kosovo)]{.underline}. [The other includes **war confronting an enemy
deemed to constitute [an existential threat]{.mark}** (as in
Afghanistan)]{.underline}. [Discursively, they are [**both framed** "in
terms of **progress** and **civilisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a
battle for modernity itself" (Jabri, 2007: 136--137). Whereas war
presented a decivilising potential for both states and individuals at
the time of WWII, one may now think of how the Individualisation of
Security contributed to its civilising nature. Ironically, Alessandro
dal Lago and Salvatore Palidda interestingly use the expression
"civilisation of war" to allude to this culture---both civilian and
military--- "that has been produced by Western countries in just under
two decades in relation to the conflicts with those who threaten (or are
presumed to threaten) Western security" (Dal Lago & Palidda, 2010: 5).
This definition, they claim, has nothing to do with either the
stereotypical ideology of Western civilisation or the so-called clash of
civilisations theorised by Huntington. Likewise, the intent of this work
was rather to highlight the procedural possibilities inherent to
civilisation as an "on-going process and a possible aim of action",
quite in Elias' manner (1991: 82).

[The [**ties connecting civilisation to security** are]{.mark} now
clear, as they both reveal to be [**central features** in]{.mark} the
historic development of **[Western]{.mark}** society and its
**[domination]{.mark} upon the rest of the world**. With [the
**resurgence of**]{.mark} **intolerance**, **[conservative
ideologies]{.mark}** and what the public opinion deems as irrational
leaders in **powerful Western democracies** dealing with **social,
economic and political problems** perceived as coming from the outside,
a crisis seems indeed to be attaining the civilisation of the West right
now. In this sense, a **crisis of Western civilisation**
[is]{.mark}]{.underline}, before anything, [[a crisis that **comes from
within**]{.mark}, because the **symbols**]{.underline}, the
**[values]{.underline}**, the social and moral priorities [suddenly fall
far from the normality we thought we knew, and **political phenomena**
shock and **surprise** [as]{.mark} the **[unexpected
consequences]{.mark}** of a lottery]{.underline}. [But times of crisis
have repeatedly [call]{.mark}ed [for]{.mark} re-thinking common
assumptions, for [**questioning** the **validity** of our
**knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for self-reflexivity, [hence the
**importance** of **[appraising the influence of]{.mark} the unconscious
dimensions of knowledge** for **minimizing** the shock and the
**surprise**, and for **learning**]{.underline}--- once again---[the
lessons from the past, aiming for a **better future**]{.underline}.

[The [**unconscious connections** between **civilisation and
security**]{.mark} have **[not]{.mark}** been **[questioned by]{.mark}**
the **[Westerners]{.mark}** themselves, for [the **symbolic capital** of
the **West**]{.mark} has **remained largely [undisrupted so
far]{.mark}**]{.underline}---although the current refugee crisis and
Brexit from the EU may be increasingly challenging that. [The feeling of
security of the civilised subjects of the West should endure, as long as
it is not unsettled by fundamental death anxieties coming from either
their civilised space, or from what they perceive to be uncivilised
Otherness]{.underline}. In this sense, [the current **[policies of
control]{.mark}** and contention [of **non-Western lives by, and within,
the West** are likely to **remain outside conscious history**]{.mark},
doomed to oblivion, **[precisely because the Western perception of
security]{.mark} is what [needs to be upheld by]{.mark} Western [elites
if its cohesion as a civilisational entity is to
endure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Hopefully, this book has revealed the
epistemological potential of the concept of civilisation in making the
domination and control of the unconscious visible.

**[C. J. Polychroniou:]{.underline}** Richard, [**US foreign
[policy]{.mark}** under the **Biden** administration [is geared toward
**escalating**]{.mark} the [**strategic competition** with]{.mark} both
[**China** and **Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, the Interim
National Strategic Guidance, released in March 2021, [[makes]{.mark} it
abundantly [clear]{.mark} that the US intends to deter its adversaries
from "inhibiting access to global commons, or dominating key regions"
and that, moreover, this work cannot be done alone, as was the case
under Trump, but [will **require** the **reinvigoration and
modernization of the alliance**]{.mark} **system**]{.underline} across
the world. [Does this read to you like a call for the start of a **new
New Cold War**?]{.underline}

**[Richard Falk:]{.underline}** **[Yes]{.underline}**, I would say [it
is **more than 'the call'** for a New Cold War, **but its
start**]{.underline}. The focus is presently much more China than
Russia, because China is seen by Washington as posing the primary
threat, and besides, it regards Russia as a traditional rival while
China poses novel and more fundamental challenges. Russia, while
behaving in an unsavory manner, dramatized by the crude handling of the
opposition figure Alexei Navalny, is seen as manageable geopolitically.
Euro-American strategy is to stiffen resistance to Russian pressure
being exerted along some of its borders, and as in the Cold War can be
handled by refurbished versions of 'containment' and 'deterrence.'

China is another matter entirely. The most serious perceived threats are
mainly associated with non-military sectors of Western, and
particularly, U.S., primacy, its dominance over a dynamic productive
economy, especially with respect to frontier technologies. The
remarkable developmental dynamism of the Chinese economy has far
outstripped anything ever achieved in the West. The United States
Government under Biden seems stubbornly blindsided, seemingly determined
to address these Chinese threats as if they could be effectively
addressed by a combination of ideological confrontation and as with
Soviet Union, containment and deterrence. So far, the Biden response is
fundamentally mistaken in its approach, which is to view China as a
similar adversary than was the Soviet Union. This Chinese challenge
cannot be successfully met frontally. It can only be met by a diagnosis
of the relative decline of the West by way of self-scrutiny, selective
emulation, and a surge of creative adaptive energies. Such a response
needs to be accompanied by a reformist agenda of socio-economic equity,
massive infrastructure investment, the adoption of fairer wealth and
income tax structures, and a commitment to a style of global leadership
that identified the national interest to a greater extent with global
public goods. Instead of focusing on holding China in check, the United
States would do much better by learning from its successes, and adapting
them to the distinctiveness of its national circumstances.

It is to be regretted that the present mode of response to China is
dangerous and anachronistic for four principal reasons. Firstly, the
mischaracterization of the Chinese challenge betrays a lack of
self-confidence and understanding by the American Biden/Blinken foreign
policy leadership. Secondly, the chosen path of confrontation risks a
fateful clash in South China Seas, an area that according to the
precepts of traditional geopolitics falls within the Chinese sphere of
influence, and a context within which Chinese firmness is perceived as
'defensive' by Beijing while the U.S. military presence is regarded as
intrusive, if not 'hegemonic.' These perceptions are aggravated by the
U.S. effort to augment its role as upholding alliance commitments in
South Asia, recently reaffirmed by a clear anti-Chinese animus in the
shape of the QUAD (Australia, Japan, India, and the U.S.), formally
named Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, which despite the euphemism
intends to signify enhanced military cooperation and shared security
concerns.

Thirdly, the longtime U.S. military superiority in the Pacific region
may not reflect the current regional balance of forces in the East and
South China Seas. Pentagon public assertions have been sounding the
alarm, insisting that in the event of a military confrontation, China
would likely come out on top unless the U.S. resorts to nuclear weapons.
According to an article written by Admiral Charles Richard, who
currently heads National Strategic Command, this assessment has been
confirmed by recent Pentagon war games and conflict simulations.

Taking account of this view, Admiral Richard advises that U.S.
preparations for such an armed encounter be changed from the possibility
recourse to nuclear weaponry to its probability. The implicit
assumption, which is scary, is that U.S. must do whatever it takes to
avoid an unacceptable political outcome even if it requires crossing the
nuclear threshold. It may be instructive to recall the Cuban Missile
Crisis of 1962 when Soviet moves to deploy defensive missile systems in
Cuba in response to renewed U.S. intervention to impose regime change.
It is instructive to recall that Cuba was accepted as independent
sovereign state entitled under international law to uphold its national
security as it sees fit, while Taiwan has been consistently falling
within the historical limits of Chinese territorial sovereignty. The
credibility of the Chinese claim was given diplomatic weight in the
Shanghai point Communiqué that re-established U.S./China relations in
1972. Kissinger recalled that in the negotiations leading to a renewal
of bilateral relations the greatly admired Chinese Foreign Minister,
Chou En-Lai, was flexible on every issue except Taiwan. That is, China
has a strong legal and historical basis for reclaiming Taiwan as an
integral part of its sovereign territory considering its armed severance
from China as a result of Japanese imperialism. China governed the area
now known as Taiwan from 1683-1895. In 1895 it was conquered and ruled
by Japan until 1945 when it was reabsorbed and became a part of the
Republic of China. After 1949 when the Chinese Communists took over
control of China, Taiwan was renamed Republic of China on Taiwan. From
the Chinese perspective, this historical past upholds the basic
contention that Taiwan is part of China and not entitled to be treated
as a separate state.

Fourthly, and maybe decisively, the international claims on the energies
and resources of the United States are quite different than they were
during the Old Cold War. There was no impending catastrophe resulting
from climate change to worry about or decaying infrastructure
desperately needing expensive repair or under-investment in social
protection by government in the area of health, housing, and education.

**[CJP:]{.underline}** Isn't it possible that the approach of the Biden
administration to the future environment of great power competition
could lead to the formation of a Russia-China military alliance,
especially since alliance formation constitutes a key element of state
interaction? Indeed, Vladimir Putin has already said that the prospect
of such partnership is "theoretically... quite possible," so the
question is this: What would be the implications for global order if a
Sino-Russian military alliance were to be formed?

**[RF:]{.underline}** I think [we are in a period of **[renewed alliance
diplomacy]{.mark}** recalling the feverish attempts of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to surround the Soviet Union
with deployed military forces]{.underline}, which was a way of
communicating to Moscow that the Soviet Union could not expand their
borders territorially without anticipating a military encounter with the
United States. At first glance, alliances conceived in these traditional
terms make little sense. Except in Taiwan it is unlikely that China
would seek to enlarge its territorial domain by the threat use of force.
In this sense, [the ad hoc diplomacy of alliance formation]{.underline},
typified by the QUAD [seems [**anachronistic**, and could **lead to
war**]{.mark}**fare** as one [among **several unintended
consequences**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, realignment as distinct from alliance frameworks does make
sense [in an international atmosphere in which the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is trying to **confront** its international
adversaries with **sanctions** and a variety of measures of **coercive
diplomacy** that are intended to constrain its policy
options]{.underline}. [Many states are **dependent on international
supply chains** for energy and food, as well as reliable trade and
investment relations]{.underline}. Reverting to the Cold War [the Soviet
Union was relatively autonomous]{.underline}. [This is much less true
under present conditions in which the **higher densities of
interdependence** are linked to acute security vulnerability to **cyber
attacks**, and where access to **drone** technologies and **computer
knowhow** make **non-state actors**, extremist **political movements**,
and **criminal syndicates** an **increasingly troublesome** part of the
global political landscape. In such an **emergent global setting**,
traditional reliance on **deterrence**, **defense capabilities**, and
**retaliatory action** are often **ineffectual**, and quite often even
**counter-productive**]{.underline}. [The purpose of contemporary
patterns of **realignment** is **less to augment defenses** against
intervention and aggression than to **broaden policy options** for
countries that **need to reach beyond their borders** to achieve
economic viability]{.underline}. Another motivation is to deflect
geopolitical bullying tactics intended to isolate adversaries. [As
[**China** and **Russia**]{.mark} are being **[portrayed as]{.mark} the
[enemies of the West]{.mark}**, their **alignment with one another**
makes sense if thought of as a reciprocally beneficial '**security
community**.' Compared to past configurations of conflictual relations,
current geopolitical maneuvers such as realignment are less
**concerned** with weaponry and war and **more** with attaining
developmental stability, **intelligence sharing**, and **reduced
vulnerability** to the **distinctive threats** and parameters of the
**Cyber Age**]{.underline}.

The logic of realignment gives to countries like China and Russia
opportunities to increase their geopolitical footprint without relying
on ideological affinities or coercion. Such a change in the nature of
world politics is more broadly evident. For instance, important
countries such as Iran and Turkey use realignment as a diplomatic tool
to offset pressures and security encroachments by U.S. and Israel. In
Iran's case despite radical differences in ideology and governing style
it is turning to China and Russia so as to protect its national
sovereignty from a range of destabilizing measures adopted by its
adversaries. Whereas Turkey, while being devalued as an alliance partner
in the NATO context, may be satisfying its overall needs by turning to
China and Russia than by sticking to its traditional role of a junior
participant in the most potent of Western alliance structures.

**[CJP:]{.underline}** Certain mainstream foreign policy analysts are
rehashing old arguments about the US-China competition, in particular,
by claiming that this is really an ideological battle between democracy
and authoritarianism. What's your own take on this matter?

**[RF:]{.underline}** I think even more so than in the Cold War [[the
**ideological battleground is a smokescreen** behind which lurk]{.mark}
**fears** and [**perceived threats** to]{.mark} the [**Western
dominance** of the **world economy** and]{.mark} of innovative
**[military tech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}. In the last half
century China has already staked a strong claim to have demonstrated a
superior development model ('socialism with Chinese characteristics') to
that produced in the capitalist United States. This Chinese achievement
is quite clearly explained and documented by the outstanding Indian
liberal economist, Deepak Nayyar, in his important study, Asian
Resurgence: Diversity in Development (2019). Great emphasis is placed by
Nayyer on the high rate of savings enabling China to finance and
strategically manage targeted investment of public funds. Nayyer
downplays the role of ideology and stresses these economistic factors,
as he analyzes the development achievements of 14 countries in Asia.

The reality of the Chinese rise makes a mockery of the triumphalist
claims of Francis Fukuyama in The End of History and The Last Man
(1992), even more so in George W. Bush's covering letter to the 2002
National Security Strategy of the United States in which he claims that
the 20th century ended with "a decisive victory for the forces of
freedom---and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom,
democracy, and free enterprise." How dated and misplaced such language
seems twenty years later!

If China now additionally manages to challenge successfully the U.S. in
such vital areas of technological innovation as artificial intelligence
and robotics it will undoubtedly reinforce this image of Chinese
ascendancy on the 21st century world stage. [It is **this prospect** of
being **relegated to the technological shadowland** that had made
**bipartisan elites** in the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**so anxious** of late]{.underline}. In fact,
even Republican stalwarts are willing to put aside their polarizing
hostility to join with Democrats in mounting a diplomatic offensive
against China that could become war-mongering interaction if Beijing
responds in kind. Graham Allison has reminded us that historical
instances where a previously ascendent power is threatened by a rising
one has often resulted in disastrous warfare. Such belligerence is
usually initiated by the political actor that feels displaced by the
changing hierarchy of influence, wealth, and status in world order,
yielding to pressure to engage the challenger while it still possesses
military superiority. \[See Allison, Destined for War: Can America and
China Escape the Thucydides Trap (2017)\]

**[CJP:]{.underline}** [**Nuclear weapons** and **climate change**
represent by far humanity's two **greatest existential crises**. Can we
really be hopeful that these threats can be]{.underline} managed [tamed
**[within the existing international system]{.mark}**? If not, what
changes are required in current interstate relations?]{.underline}

**[RF:]{.underline}** Of course, at this time we have become acutely
aware of such global existential threats by experiencing the ordeal of
[the **COVID** pandemic]{.underline}, which has [revealed the
**conflictual state-centric manner** of dealing with a situation that
could have been **more effectively addressed** if responding by way of
**global solidarity**]{.underline}. [As the pandemic now appears to be
subsiding in most parts of the world, we cannot be encouraged by the
weakness of cooperative impulses despite the obvious self-interested
benefits for all if a global commons approach had been adopted with
respect to testing, treatment, and distribution of
vaccines]{.underline}. This negative background [suggests that **[it
a]{.mark} somewhat [vain hope to suppose]{.mark} that the [threats posed
by nuclear weapons and climate change can be successfully
managed]{.mark}** over time]{.underline}. [**[Each]{.mark}** of these
mega-threats **[disclose different features of a]{.mark}n essentially
[dysfunctional and inequitable]{.mark} system of [world
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [World history has now entered [a
**bio-political phase** where]{.mark}]{.underline} civilizational
achievements are at risk and [even the **[survival of the human species
is in doubt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Analogous dysfunctions** of a
different nature are **evident** in the **internal political and
economic life** of most **sovereign states**]{.underline}.

The relationship to nuclear weapons has been problematic from the
beginning, starting from the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japanese
cities in 1945 as the war was nearing its end. The horrifying civilian
consequences seared the consequences of collective human conscience
almost to the extent of the Holocaust. The two realities exemplifying
the atrocities of World War II are Auschwitz and Hiroshima. It is
illuminating that in the first instance the behavior of the loser in the
war was criminalized in the Genocide Convention while that of the winner
in the second instance was legitimated although left under a dark cloud
that lingers until now. The reality is that nuclear weapons are retained
for possible use by nine states, including the most militarily powerful
countries. The fact that the great majority of non-nuclear governments
and the sentiments of most people in the world unconditionally oppose
such weaponry has hardly mattered. The UN recently sponsored the Treaty
of Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) that entered into force in
January 2021; however, neither law nor morality can challenge the
resolve of the nuclear weapons states to retain their freedom to
possess, deploy, develop, and even threaten or use such weaponry of mass
destruction. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council, the
first states to develop nuclear weapons, have issued a formal statement
expressing their belief in the non-proliferation regime and deterrence
as a preferred model of nuclear war prevention to that associated with a
norm of unconditional prohibition reinforced by phased, monitored, and
verified disarmament treaty process.

[Martin Sherwin in his definitive **[study]{.mark}**]{.underline},
Gambling with Armageddon: Nuclear Rouletter from Hiroshima to the Cuban
Missile Crisis (2020), [convincingly [shows]{.mark} that [the
**avoidance of nuclear war**]{.mark} has been [a consequence
of]{.mark}]{.underline} dumb [[**luck**, **not rational oversight**
or]{.mark} the inhibitions on use associated with
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The point being that [**despite**
the **magnitude of the threats posed** by the **existence of nuclear
weapons** the **structures** of **Westphalian statism** has **prevailed
over** considerations of **law**, **morality**]{.underline}, common
sense, and rationality. [[What is absent with]{.mark} regard to these
[**existential global threats** is]{.mark} a [**sufficient political
will** to **transform the underlying structural features** by which
**authority**, **power**, and **identity** have been **managed on a
global level**]{.mark} for last several centuries]{.underline}. [The
**absence of trust among countries** is **given precedence**, and is
further reinforced by the **weakness of global solidarity mechanisms**,
resulting on leaving this **ultimate weapon** in potentially
**irresponsible hands**]{.underline}, the fate of the earth in Jonathan
Schell's book bearing that title, published in 1982.

[Climate change has dramatized a different facet of this statist
structure of world order]{.underline}. [The need for the cooperative and
urgent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has been validated by a
strong consensus of scientific opinion. The effects of inaction or
insufficient action are being concretely experienced in the form of
global warming, ocean levels rising, extreme weather events, glacial
melting, and migrations from droughts and floods]{.underline}. [Yet
effective responsive action is blocked by inequalities of circumstances
and perception that generate disagreements about the allocation of
responsibility and by short-termism that makes private and public sector
decision makers reluctant to depress performance statistics by expensive
adjustments that cut profits and development]{.underline}. [There is a
widespread recognition of the need for drastic action, but the best that
the collective will of governments have been able to do is to produce
the Paris Agreement]{.underline} in 2015, which leaves it up to the good
will and responsible voluntary behavior of governments to reduce
emissions, [a rather wobbly foundation on which to stake the future of
humanity]{.underline}.

[The UN as now constituted cannot provide platforms for addressing
global existential threats in an effective and equitable
manner]{.underline}. The responses to the [COVID]{.underline} pandemic
[offer a template for such a negative assessment]{.underline}. [It was
obvious that short-term national economic and diplomatic interests
prevailed]{.underline} at the expense of minimizing the health hazards
of virus COVID-19. [Once these interests were satisfied the richer
countries felt virtuous by resorting to feel good philanthropy, which
was masked as empathy for poorer countries and their populations. These
societies had been left almost totally without access to the protective
medical equipment, ventilators, and vaccines during the height of the
health hazards]{.underline}.

A revealing extreme instance of the pattern was embodied in the Israeli
approach which was very effective within Israel, while withholding
vaccines from the approximately five million Palestinians living in the
Occupied Palestinian Territories. This disparity ignored Israel's
explicit obligation under Article 56 of the Fourth Geneva Convention to
accord protection to an occupied people in the event of an epidemic.
[What is disclosed]{.underline} beyond reasonable doubt [is the
structural dominance of statist and market forces combined with the
weakness of existing mechanisms of **[global solidarity]{.mark}**, which
[are **preconditions** for]{.mark} upholding **[global public
goods]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[An **analogous dynamic**]{.mark} occurs
[**within states**, reflecting]{.mark} the [**class**, **gender**, and
**race**]{.mark} interests and the disproportionate burdens borne by the
poor, women, and marginalized minorities]{.underline}.

This book introduces a Foucault-influenced approach to
**[[poststructural policy analysis]{.underline}]{.mark}** and explains
the usefulness of this perspective for those wishing to engage in
critical policy analysis. It offers a user-friendly "tool" to conduct
poststructural policy analysis, called "What's the Problem Represented
to be?" (WPR approach). [Applications]{.underline} of the approach [by
policy workers/analysts illustrate its potential for disrupting
conventional views about the meaning of policy and how governing takes
place]{.underline}.

The WPR approach brings together several Foucauldian modes of inquiry,
including archaeology, genealogy, and problematization, to generate a
range of new questions for policy workers/analysts. These new
[**questions** provide [guide]{.mark}lines for [thinking about
policy]{.mark} development [at a level **uncommonly
probed**]{.mark}---the deep-seated presuppositions and
**[assumptions]{.mark}** that **underpin policies** [and the
ways]{.mark} in which **[policies]{.mark}** actively produce, or
**[constitute]{.mark}**, "[problems]{.mark}", "[subjects]{.mark}",
"[objects]{.mark}", [and]{.mark} "[places]{.mark}" in specific
contexts]{.underline}. [This innovative approach to policy analysis
[**puts in question** the]{.mark} **taken-for-granted [view]{.mark}**
[prevalent]{.mark} among many who develop, implement, and **analyze
policies** [that **policy problems**]{.mark} are self-evident, and that
subjects, objects, and places **[simply exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[It facilitates critical policy analysis through **[creating the
possibility of thinking otherwise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The book has two parts. Part I locates the particular poststructural
approach introduced in the book within other recent developments in the
policy analysis field and elaborates its theoretical grounding. Chapter
1 sets the scene. It provides a brief synopsis of the Foucauldian
version of poststructuralism that guides the analysis in subsequent
chapters. It also highlights the importance of this stance for how
policy work is thought about and practiced, emphasizing the possibility
of critical engagement and contestation.

Chapter 2 introduces the WPR approach and explains the forms of
criticism it involves. [The approach]{.underline}, as elaborated there,
[encourages critical interrogation of policy proposals
through]{.underline} six [questions]{.underline} and an undertaking to
apply those questions to one's own proposals (see WPR Chart on page 20).
[Importantly]{.underline}, a WPR [analysis **[does not offer]{.mark}
firm [solutions]{.mark} to assumed problems**. **[Rather]{.mark}**, it
[encourages]{.mark} policy workers [to **reflect on how**]{.mark}
**policy ["problems" are]{.mark}** produced (or
**[represented]{.mark}**) [within]{.mark} the policies and **[policy
proposals]{.mark}** they develop and implement]{.underline}.

The argument, introduced in Chapter 2 and developed throughout the book,
is that [governing takes place through the ways in which "problems" are
represented in policies (problem representations). This]{.underline}
view of how governing occurs [brings a new urgency to consideration of
how "problems" are constituted within policies, the unexamined forms of
thinking they rely upon, the practices that generate them and the
effects they produce]{.underline}. The term "effects" captures the ways
in which [[particular]{.mark} problem [representations **limit what can
be thought**]{.mark} (**discursive effects**), **[affect what]{.mark} it
[is possible for people to become]{.mark}** (**subjectification
effects**) [and **impact**]{.mark} on how they live their
**[lives]{.mark}** (lived effects)]{.underline}. [**[Probing]{.mark}
problem [representations]{.mark}** for these effects [becomes]{.mark} a
**[politically efficacious]{.mark}** task, **opening up consideration of
alternative problematizations** of a wide range of social
issues]{.underline}.

Chapter 3 introduces key theoretical concepts in Foucault-influenced
poststructural analysis. The chapter contains seven subsections, each of
which is dedicated to a group of related concepts. These subsections
assist readers to grasp what it means to:

• talk about power as productive;

• take practices as a starting point for analysis;

• focus on discourses as knowledges;

• examine governmental problematizations;

• adopt a governmentality perspective;

• carry out Foucauldian-style genealogies;

• put in question the humanist subject.

The chapter, thus, provides a resource for policy analysts interested in
using the WPR approach by outlining direct links between Foucauldian
themes and concepts, and the WPR questions.

Part II of the book illustrates the forms of critical analysis made
possible through Foucault-influenced poststructuralism, and
specifically, through application of the WPR approach. [It draws on the
work of a diverse array of **[policy]{.mark} workers/[analysts from many
countries]{.mark}** who [**have used** the]{.mark} questions in the
[approach to examine]{.mark} critically [a wide range of policy]{.mark}
developments. These examples of application have been organized around
four themes---**making and unmaking "problems", "subjects", "objects",
and "places"**]{.underline}.

The uniting argument that these "things" have been made---and hence can
be unmade---finds its inspiration in the poststructural thinking that
underpins the book. In a poststructural perspective things that are
commonly taken for granted as real and unchanging (e.g., nations, public
places, addiction), including the presumed fixed nature of human
subjects and groups of human subjects (e.g., youth, irregular migrants),
are seen as generated in repeated heterogeneous practices and relations.
They are made. Activity is involved in their becoming. Hence, they are
political creations rather than inescapable ways of being or facts of
life.

[The analytic task]{.underline}, therefore, [becomes [**drawing
attention** to the **politics involved** in their **emergence as
"**]{.mark}**the [real"]{.mark}**---how it was possible for these things
to come to be---making that politics visible]{.underline}. [Politics
here is understood to comprise the plural practices involved in the
coming to be of "things"]{.underline}. **[[By denaturalizing
"things"]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this way, [they are **opened up** for
possible modification---[they **can be unmade**]{.mark}---[should they
be found to produce **detrimental consequences for specific groups of
people or**]{.mark} **for [life in general]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Chapter 4 elaborates what it means to say that "problems" are
constituted in policies. It traces and contests how "problems" are
conceptualized in a range of policy theories, including classic
rationalist, interpretive and critical realist approaches. From this
starting place it demonstrates how select applications of the WPR
approach put into question "problems" presumed to exist in drug and
alcohol policy, and gender equality policy.

Chapter 5 confronts the challenging task of rethinking how "subjects"
are conceptualized in the policies that purportedly address them. [The
view that subjects exist as particular kinds of people (rational,
self-sufficient, risk averse, caring, lazy) independently of policy is
countered with illustrations of how **["subjects" are constituted within
policies]{.mark}** that **allocate specific subject positions for them
to occupy**]{.underline}. ["Subjects" become provisional, [**in ongoing
formation**, emphasizing the importance of **examining policies for how
they produce "subjects"**]{.mark}]{.underline}. WPR applications that
undertake this task are drawn from the following fields: education
policy, health policy, immigration policy, economic policy, transport
policy, environment policy, and disability/equality policy.

Chapter 6 calls upon readers to rethink the nature of "objects". Instead
of presumed, fixed "entities", they emerge as "objectivizations"
produced in policy. The point of this form of intervention is to
encourage policy workers/analysts to interrogate presumed "objects that
exist" and show how, through problematization, they are given specific
characteristics and associations. The postulated "singularity of
objects" turns out to be "an accomplishment," an act of "coordination"
(Mol 2002: 7--8), with research methods identified as major players in
the reinforcement of particular realities. On these grounds, the
applications of WPR in this chapter call for a rethinking of the
commonly assumed policy objects of "poverty", "addiction", "literacy",
and "wellbeing".

Chapter 7 [elaborates the implications of taking assumed geographical
entities---"places"---for granted as specific kinds of
"objects"]{.underline}. Further, it illustrates, through selected WPR
applications, how [poststructural policy analysis draws attention to the
**multitude of practices** that **need to be repeated on a daily basis**
for certain "sites" to **emerge as "real"**]{.underline}. [In the
process this form of analysis **produces opportunities to challenge the
assumed facticity of "states", "regions"**]{.underline}, "public
places", [etc]{.underline}.

The Appendix, by Bacchi and Bonham, offers a poststructural methodology
for analyzing interviews. Policy analysts commonly draw on interview
material to provide background or on-the-ground perspectives on specific
developments. Since poststructuralism puts in question "subjects" as
sources of "true" information based on "direct" experience, it is
necessary to approach interviews differently from forms of analysis that
rest on these premises. PIA \[Poststructural Interview Analysis\] offers
a way to locate interview comments within the practices that generate
them and thus to politicize what tends to be treated as "truth",
including assumptions about interviewees themselves as sources of truth.
To this end, it draws upon key theoretical concepts introduced in the
book, including genealogy and discursive practices. The research task
becomes interrogating how specific "things said" come to be said, and
how transformation is possible.

Throughout the book, the WPR approach is proposed as an accessible and
adaptable guide to poststructural policy analysis through seven
interrelated forms of questioning and analysis. [The six questions
enable [analysts]{.mark} to [select a **specific
policy**]{.mark}]{.underline} or governmental technology, [[and]{.mark}
to **[interrogate it]{.mark}** in ways [that]{.mark} **reveal levels of
complexity that require consideration**. They [**provoke specific forms
of political engagement**, encouraging]{.mark} analysts [to **reflect
on**]{.mark} **possible [alternative
problematizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [At the same time [a
practice]{.mark} of self-problematization, **[endorsed]{.mark}** in the
undertaking [to apply]{.mark} the]{.underline} WPR [questions [to
**one's own proposals**]{.mark} or recommendations, [**alerts
researchers to their participation in ontological politics**, **making
rather than reflecting "reality"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Chapter 2).
[[The **ethos of continual criticism** thus promoted **opens up the
space for challenge**]{.mark} and protest]{.underline}.

The WPR approach, however, needs to be used carefully. Some key premises
that can sometimes slip away in the process of analysis are summarized
here:

• Usually the terms "problem" and "problems" are placed in scare quotes
to signal that their commonly assumed status as fixed and readily
identifiable "entities" is put in question. Departure from this practice
occurs only where it is clear that a particular theoretical stance, such
as positivism, treats problems as straightforward and uncontentious (see
Chapter 1, endnote 1, p. 12).

• [Analysis begins from proposals or proposed solutions and researchers
"read off" the implicit problem representations within
them]{.underline}.

• References to governing include but extend beyond the state to
encompass a wide range of agencies and people involved in societal
administration.

• The term "discourse" refers to background knowledge, and "discourses"
are knowledges rather than forms of language use.

• "Subjects" are provisional and in ongoing formation, rather than
stable kinds of being.

• Governmentalities, such as neoliberalism, are not monolithic and
determining rationalities, nor ideologies.

• Resistance does not sit outside power, meaning that forms of protest
might also involve forms of complicity.

• References to strategies and "strategic relations" describe complex
societal relations and practices rather than intentional manipulation.

• Poststructural policy analysis aims to study, not people's views, but
how it is possible for such views to exist.

In terms of political vision, [the **perspective
developed**]{.underline} in this book [is **valuable** for what it
**opens up** rather than for what it **proscribes**]{.underline} (Moss
1998: 9). [[It **does not put forward a blueprint for political
change**]{.mark}, which people are expected to adopt, but
[instead]{.mark} aims to "**[craft a different kind of political space
in which critics can]{.mark} operate**"]{.underline} (Brown 1998: 34).
In tune with Foucault's own "version of emancipation", [**universals**
are **replaced with** "**specific transformations**" that **minimize
domination**]{.underline} (Moss 1998: 9). In line with this view the WPR
approach consists of questions, not directives. As the sub-title for the
book suggests, it is a guide to practice. With the WPR approach as
guide, [policy workers/analysts [become "**policy
problematizers**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Webb 2014: 371). [They are
**spurred to reflect on the presuppositions underpinning specific policy
proposals**, **including their own** proposals. They are prompted,
further, to reflect on alternative ways of constituting "problems", and
on how alternative problematizations may produce new "subjects",
different "objects", and other ways of imagining political
space]{.underline}.

As illustrated in the applications in the book, [the]{.underline} WPR
[approach **has [proved popular with policy workers]{.mark}/analysts**.
Clearly, **[there is a significant section of the policy community eager
to embrace]{.mark} the form of [critical analysis]{.mark}** it
offers]{.underline}. The applications [also indicate the popularity of
the approach among **[research students]{.mark}**, who [**are often also
policy workers**, in a **wide range of**]{.mark} **policy
[fields]{.mark}**. These and other scholars find the]{.underline} WPR
[questions helpful in generating and structuring useful research
projects]{.underline} (Manning 2014; Bletsas and Beasley 2012). [By
[making the approach **more accessible**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this book
[**[produces poststructural policy analysis]{.mark}** in a form that
people can employ and enjoy]{.underline}.

Journal of International Relations, 27(4), 2021, DOI

Although critical IR theorists were inspired by a wide range of
thinkers---from Horkheimer and the early Frankfurt School through
Wittgenstein, Winch and Kuhn to Habermas and Cox as well as Foucault
(George and Campbell, 1990: 271--277, 282, 284)---they originally
subscribed to the same two core principles derived from the same
arguments. The historical and therefore particular nature of knowledge
constitutes theory as "always for someone and for some purpose" (Cox,
1996: 87; Devetak, 2013: 164; Campbell and Bleiker, 2016:
198)---depriving the sciences of an Archimedean point from which to
establish objectivity or grasp totality (George and Campbell, 1990:
270--271). In order to overcome these limitations, critical theory aims
at "the social and political complex as a whole rather than . . . the
separate parts" (Cox, 1996: 89). But since this whole ultimately remains
inaccessible, critical theory cannot offer an authoritative vision of a
better society (Cox, 1996: 97). [In order **[to keep the possibility of
a transformation of]{.mark} the [entire society
alive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, therefore, [critical theory
**[refuse]{.mark}s [to engage in "problem-solving"]{.mark}** [which is
geared toward **making the existing order function more
smoothly**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cox, 1996: 89). [Instead, the aim of
**[transcending the existing order in practice requires overcoming its
limitations in theory: by reflecting "upon the process of theorizing
itself"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Cox, 1996: 88; Hutchings, 2007: 72;
Rengger, 2001: 105)---[and by **thus opening up thinking
space**]{.underline} (Ashley, 1981: 217; Ashley and Walker, 1990: 259;
George and Campbell, 1990: 269--270, 288).

Yet, Horkheimer and first-generation critical IR theorists did not just
share this critical stance toward **[[calls for "practical
relevance"]{.underline}]{.mark}** for theoretical reasons.
[Historically]{.underline}, such calls [**[forced]{.mark} theorists [to
choose sides]{.mark}**---between **communists** and **capitalists** in
the 1920s and 1930s, between the **Soviets** and the **Americans**
during the Cold War---[and]{.mark} hence to **[sacrifice the critique
of]{.mark} a society or [an international system in which these were the
only choices]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**Resisting demands for practical
relevance** was]{.mark} therefore **[the condition of the possibility to
imagine an alternative]{.mark}** society or international system; it
played a key role in creating space for critical thinking and
imagination beyond the given options]{.underline}. [And **yet**, it is
precisely **such calls for practical relevance that drive** much of the
current **debate**]{.underline}---raising the question how and why such
core principles are now fundamentally contested.

In order to answer this question, I will draw again on Horkheimer who
offers explicit reflections on critical theory's historical dynamics.
First, if critical theory cannot offer a substantive vision of a better
society, it cannot offer any (authoritative) guidance for political
practice (Horkheimer, 1968: 31). Second, within a fragmented society in
which material and ideological power serves to support privileges, all
groups represent particular interests (Horkheimer, 1968: 37--38). Hence,
critical theory cannot identify particular individuals, groups, issues,
or causes as "progressive" per se, as seeds of a future just society
(Horkheimer, 1968: 37--38). Today's oppressed can become tomorrow's
oppressors. Hence, critical theory bears "no flag" (Ashley and Walker,
1990: 264).

[But this does not mean that critical theory has no political impact. On
the contrary, by undermining traditional ways of understanding
particular issues, critical theories constitute them in new ways and
thus pave the way for new practices. Critical (like any other) theories
thus inevitably have political impact and therefore]{.underline} may
also [contribute to improvements for particular groups within
society]{.underline}---as set out in the previous section. However,
within a society that emerges from the competition between particular
groups, the empowerment of some groups changes power relations within
society but does not lead to the emancipation of society as a whole.
Moreover, [critical theories can never guarantee the political outcome
of their particular activities because society as a whole emerges from
the relations of all of its parts]{.underline}. It provides, as Foucault
(1984) put it, nothing but a "historical analysis of the limits that are
imposed on us and an experiment with the possibility of going beyond
them" (p. 50). This is why critical theories "issue no promises" (Ashley
and Walker, 1990: 264).

Critical theory therefore contributes to historical developments even
while it is itself subject to historical changes. It is motivated by
different historical problems (Weber, 2014: 533): the rise of fascism
and national socialism for Gramsci and Horkheimer in the 1920s and 1930s
(see Morton, 2003: 121--122), the student revolution in 1968 for
Foucault (Torfing, 2005: 5), the decline of the public sphere for
Habermas in the 1970s, and the onset of the second Cold War in the 1980s
which finally motivated IR scholars to import critical theory into the
discipline (Ashley and Walker, 1990: 265).5 Critical theories are also
shaped by their particular focus---racism, sexism, political violence,
material inequality, subjectivity---developing the theoretical and
methodological tools suited to their subject matter. As soon as critical
theory is applied in practice, therefore, it fragments into critical
theories.

This plurality of critical theories gives rise to significant
differences and sometimes even to competition, for example, between a
focus on capitalism or patriarchy, or on everyday vs systemic
reproductions of power (Hartmann, 1979; Koddenbrock, 2015). But for the
most part, this diversity of critical theories is the result of the
application of core critical principles to different problems within
society and historical periods. That is, most feminist, queer, Marxist,
poststructuralist, postcolonial theories subscribe to the
metatheoretical assumptions that theory is practice, that all knowledge
is historical, and investigate the knowledge that constitutes their
respective problems. Hence, feminist and queer theories are the updated
and gender sensitive versions of critical theory just as decolonialism
is the critical theory sensitive to colonial issues and
poststructuralism represents a non-statist critical approach.

[But this does not mean that [**critical theory** can]{.mark}not
**[become uncritical]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The fate of discourse
ethics provides an instructive example. Jürgen Habermas was dissatisfied
with the "pessimistic" implications of critical theory and set out to
rekindle its positive emancipatory element (George and Campbell, 1990:
278--279). In order to support the argument that communicative action
provided positive resources for a transformative practice, Habermas
distinguished between the system, governed by the instrumental logic of
money and power, on the one hand and the lifeworld, governed by the
logic of understanding, on the other (Habermas, 1984: 366--399, 1987:
106--130; Wyn Jones, 2000: 8). Yet [[**by** **separating**
**communication** from **power**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hutchings, 2005:
165), the lifeworld from the system (Schmid, 2018: 7), [[the **subject**
from the **object**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Fluck, 2014: 57), emancipation
from an analysis of existing injustices (Jahn, 1998: 615, 622),
democracy from capitalism (Azmanova, 2020), discourse ethics identified
a particular element of existing society as "progressive" and **[[ended
up justifying the very power and interest from which vulnerable
societies needed protection]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Linklater, 2005:
154). The tragic fate of Habermas' [**[desire for practical
relevance]{.mark}** confirms the arguments of early critical theorists,
within and outside of IR, and it illustrates how the **relationship to
practice [leads to significant changes within critical theory
itself]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[We thus have to distinguish between two related dimensions (or levels)
of critical theory: Its metatheoretical assumptions which are shared
widely and are historically relatively stable since they are derived
from the nature of liberal society as a whole; and its application in
practice which gives rise to a plurality of particular critical theories
that are constantly in flux, reflecting the changing relations between
different groups and issue areas within society]{.underline}
(Horkheimer, 1968: 49, 50). What links these two dimensions are the core
principles of critical theory: to refrain from problem-solving and from
separating theory and reality in the scientific process. And [while the
idea of emancipation is strictly tied to the metatheoretical level and
the transformation of society as a whole, particular critical theories
address specific issues within society and thus inevitably become
entangled in its development]{.underline}.

These reflections [help make sense of the curious frustration of
critical theorists despite their political
achievements]{.underline}---for the latter clearly belong into the
second register of [critical theories successfully addressing particular
problems within society]{.underline}. This [leads to the mainstreaming
and institutionalization of various "critical" projects and to the
integration of critical theories into the academic establishment and
public discourse. Yet]{.underline} the rise of populism highlights that
[these achievements do not amount to the transformation of society as a
whole]{.underline}. Moreover, confronted with the rise of populism this
very success puts critical theorists in a position of defending the
status quo---which now embodies some of their achievements.
[Disappointment]{.underline} therefore [arises from the fact that the
particular achievements of critical theory appear to go hand in hand
with the failure to transform society as a whole]{.underline}.

[Yet, this perception of failure stands in contradiction to the original
metatheoretical principles in which emancipation is neither derived from
features of empirical reality nor does it entail any concrete empirical
claims]{.underline}. Hence, [critical theory **does not promise
emancipation**---it simply **posits** that the **transformation of
society** as whole may be **possible**]{.underline}. Yet, the validity
of this assumption can only be determined with hindsight---once that
transformation has occurred. [In the meantime, there is **no empirical
evidence** that **can prove it right or wrong**]{.underline}
(Horkheimer, 1968: 37, 39, 55). [Brexit, Trump, and the rise of populism
do not prove that emancipation is not possible]{.underline}. At the
metatheoretical level, [critical theory is therefore "never 'accurate'
or 'wrong'; it is only more or less illuminating]{.underline}, more or
less provocative, [more or less of an incitement to thought,
imagination, desire, possibilities for renewal"]{.underline} (Brown,
2002: 574)---[and this **potential is realized by not representing
things as they are**, by undermining their familiarity, by providing
different narratives, by **refusing to be "useful" and by focusing on
the thinking that constitutes practice**]{.underline}. While this
theoretical practice can lead to empirical claims that require testing,
it does not affect the metatheoretical assumption. But [instead of
applying these principles]{.underline} to the current political
juncture, critical [theorists read recent political developments as
empirical evidence for the failure of critical theory, as evidence for
being out of sync with history and out of touch with practice. They have
thus lost sight of the]{.underline} metatheoretical nature of the
concept of emancipation and of the originally [fundamental assumption
that theory is practice and that all knowledge is
historical]{.underline}. Moreover, [in the attempt to get back into line
with history and practice, they explicitly aim to **discard** the two
practical principles that **link the two levels** of critical
theory**:** the **refusal to engage in problem-solving** and the
requirement to **focus on the knowledge that constitutes
practice**]{.underline}.

In the last step of this analysis, I will locate this development of
critical theory in its historical context and show that [rather than
being out of sync with history, the recent **[debate]{.mark}** is
perfectly in line with, and **[reflects the pressures of]{.mark},
neoliberalism**]{.underline}. Historically, the introduction and
development of critical theory in IR coincides almost exactly with the
period of neoliberalism---and therefore with the extension of economic
principles, of the market and competition, into all spheres of life.
This development was amplified by the end of the Cold War that led to
its globalization. It created a situation, in which it was "easier to
imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism"
(Jameson, 2003: 76) and Margaret Thatcher's [oft repeated claim that
**[There Is no Alternative]{.mark}**]{.underline} (TINA) [was widely
experienced as a reality]{.underline} (Fisher, 2009).

Moreover, this extension of market principles and competition included
knowledge production and education (Brown, 2005; Harvey, 2007).
Knowledge was now seen as a commodity and education as a driver of
economic growth, development, and global competitiveness. As Patrick's
(2013) research shows, universities became producers of commercially
exploitable knowledge: from intellectual property and patents to the
training that turns student customers into high-skills, high-wage,
marketable knowledge workers. Depending on the context, this process has
taken a myriad of forms: from Ronald Reagan's reduction of public
funding for higher education in the United States, through the
redirection of such funds from universities to students in the United
Kingdom, to the introduction of a competitive process for the funding of
"excellence clusters" in Germany. Despite vast differences in higher
education systems, the common aim of these policies is to introduce
competition---which global university rankings ensure affects all of
them.

It also affects the nature of knowledge: [for even while knowledge
becomes the most important commodity in the "knowledge economy," **[all
knowledge that is not readily commodified loses its value]{.mark}**.
"[Hence the]{.mark} intensifying **[demand]{.mark} on and [in
universities]{.mark}** . . . [for **knowledge** that is
**applicable**]{.mark} and marketable]{.underline}" (Brown, 2002:
573)---[**[including "critical" theory]{.mark}** which can provide
institutions with a "progressive" brand and helps to attract
students.]{.underline}

[This is the historical context in which critical IR theory successfully
established itself, willy-nilly participating in the process of
professionalization]{.underline} described above[:]{.underline}
[contributing to textbooks, landing Chair appointments, founding
critical journals, establishing professional networks, volunteering in
professional organizations, validating critical work through prizes.
Critical theorists have turned themselves into highly competent
knowledge entrepreneurs and critical theory has become part of the
academic establishment and is hence also subject to its
pressures]{.underline}.

This context and its pressures are reflected in critical theory's latest
developments. If there is no alternative to the existing globalized
neoliberal world order, this undermines the rationale for a
metatheoretical conception of the transformation of society as a
whole---but it does provide a reason for shifting attention to
particular issues within that society. [The **pressure to produce
marketable knowledge** directly **undermines** the **critical
requirement not to become useful**---and [provides **strong incentives**
for **"critical problem-solving"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Post-Critical
IR?, 2018). [[In light of the **demand for applicable
knowledge**]{.mark}, the critical requirement [to **focus on the
knowledge that constitutes reality** **appears like a waste of
time**]{.mark}---and calls for a direct engagement with
practice]{.underline} (Kurki, 2011). [[And pervasive **competition**
leads to the **individualization** not only of **success** but]{.mark}
also of [**failure**---and]{.mark} therefore [to **excessive
self-criticism of critical scholars**]{.mark} expressed in the current
debate]{.underline} (Conway, 2021).

Hence, if critical theorists today feel that their approaches lack the
ability to provoke and inspire new ways of seeing things and acting in
the world, it is not because they are out of touch with practice or out
of sync with history. Quite the opposite. It is because critical
theorists are deeply embedded in the dynamic globalization of
neoliberalism that they suffer from its closing down of alternative
thinking spaces. And it is because critical theory participates in and
is dependent on the dominant neoliberal practices of knowledge
production that it experiences the pressure to be useful in and for
existing society---and thus to abandon original critical principles.

Conclusion

[Critical theory is thus indeed in crisis, but its problems are widely
misunderstood and the solutions run the **[risk]{.mark}** of
**[abandoning critical theory entirely]{.mark}**---instead of
**reinvigorating it**. Many critical theorists attribute their
disappointment to a lack of engagement with practice and a disconnect
from the current historical juncture. Yet, we have seen that **critical
theory** [has always engaged with **concrete policies**]{.mark} and was
well aligned with historical developments. In fact, it [can be proud of
a wide range of **political achievements**]{.mark}. Critical theory
[is]{.mark} today [firmly]{.mark} ([though]{.mark} by **[no]{.mark}**
means **[irreversibly]{.mark}**) [embedded in **universities**]{.mark}
and **textbooks**, in **[social movements]{.mark}** and **[international
organizations]{.mark}**, in **public [debates]{.mark}** [and **foreign
policies**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[And **[yet]{.mark}**, it is the resultant close alignment with the
historical forces of neoliberalism that has cost critical theory its
inspirational quality. It **subjects critical theory to [the pervasive
experience of TINA]{.mark}** and thus challenges its core assumption
that an alternative form of society is possible. And it is critical
theory's active participation in neoliberal forms of knowledge
production that **dissolves its original suspicion of practical
relevance and [engenders calls to become "more effective in]{.mark} its
[daily practice]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (Post-Critical IR?, 2018). [The
intimate entanglement with neoliberal history and practice thus
simultaneously undermines critical theory's core aims and means: the
emancipatory ideal of the possibility of an alternative form of society
and the refusal to engage in problem-solving as the means to approach
this aim]{.underline}.

[But if the problem lies in the close entanglement with history and
practice, the solution cannot lie in more of the same. On the contrary,
such suggestions turn critical theory into an embodiment of neoliberal
world views and practices. "Updating" core critical principles, for
example, subsumes theory under the dominant historical forces and
sacrifices the space created by their tension---an end of history that
**[literally removes the logical possibility of alternatives]{.mark}**.
Similarly, searching for an authoritative version of critical theory
extends the introduction of neoliberal competition into the realm of
critical theories leading, just as in society at large, to fragmentation
instead of the recognition of common predicaments and principles that
could further creative cooperation. And the demand for acting in the
world requires instrumental rationality and catapults critical back into
traditional theory]{.underline} (Rengger, 2001: 102, 105)---as the fate
of discourse ethics clearly demonstrates. [[If we capitulate "to the
demand that theory **reveal truth**]{.mark}, deliver applications, [or
**solve**]{.mark} each of [the problems it defines]{.mark}," [we
**sacrifice**]{.mark} **the very [space for potential renewal]{.mark}**
that our inevitable alignment with the forces of neoliberalism has
closed down]{.underline} (Brown, 2002: 573--574).

[Hence, if attachment is the problem, [the **solution** lies in]{.mark}
detachment: in **creating spaces** in which **different forms of
thinking become possible** again. And this is precisely what critical
theory's core principles were originally designed to produce: by
[**forcing** the theorist to **step away from the problem itself and
focus on the knowledge that constitutes it instead**]{.mark}, **[by
refusing to solve problems]{.mark} directly [and instead offering new
ways of seeing these problems]{.mark}** to a variety of creative
political actors]{.underline}. We need, in short, to remind ourselves of
the metatheoretical principles that critical theories share with each
other, to apply them to our current predicament, and thereby to identify
those pressures that need to be resisted and analyzed (Hutchings, 2001:
88; 90; Levine, 2012; Paipais, 2011). [And this, to be clear, is **[not
an argument against practical political engagement]{.mark}**---which
critical theorists have always undertaken. It is **[an argument against
confusing political practice with critical theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}
because the latter never promises a practical transformation of society
as a whole. It promises to create the space for political
imagination---a space that closes down when theory is made to fit
practice.

Security*, Routledge, 2014, ISBN 987-0-203-07130-4, pp.4-6 /GoGreen!

The moral anxiety and debate in such cases-just a few of many-suggests
something important. **[Ethics matters]{.underline}**. in this book, we
contend that [the nature of **global insecurity**]{.underline} in the
last century, [and [the **kinds of security**]{.mark} **that the world
[will be able to achieve]{.mark}** in this century, [**depends
significantly** on]{.mark} ethics: on [the **ethics** we bring to **our
analysis**]{.mark}, policymaking [and]{.mark} decisions; on the
**ethics** [that **underpins** our understanding of **what security is**
and **to whom it is owed**]{.mark}; and on the ethics that shapes the
realities we accept or deny]{.underline}. Whether people live or die,
whether they suffer or prosper\--which people live and prosper and where
they are able to do so are ethical questions. [How these questions are
answered in the real world will be the results of [particular **ethical
frameworks, rules and decisions**]{.mark}; the result of the ways in
which ethical dilemmas are posed, and how they are addressed and
resolved]{.underline}. Is it right to attack or target cities with
nuclear weapons? Is it right to even possess them? Is it right to detain
asylum seekers, push their boats out to sea, or return them to the
places from which they fled? [[**Is it right** to target]{.mark}
terrorists and insurgents [with]{.mark} remote-controlled **[robotic
aircraft and missiles]{.mark}**, even if those killed include civilians
and if their operators aim---and kill without
risk**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Is it right to invade a foreign country
to stop crimes against humanity, end a famine, build a state, or remove
a regime, and if so, what are the right ways of going about it? Is it
right to use torture, or suspend habeas corpus or the rule of law, to
protect our security? What forms of reasoning, what criteria and ends,
should govern such decisions?

[These are some of what most of us recognise as \"moral\" questions
central to war and security questions about killing, harm and
humanity---and put in this form they [are]{.mark} certainly [of]{.mark}
great [importance]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, such questions
are addressed in great depth in the \"just war\'\' tradition, and you
will read more about that school of thought in the pages that follow.
[**[However]{.mark}**, in this book we argue that [the **influence** and
**problem** of **ethics** in **security** goes beyond **moral choices in
particular cases**]{.mark}, and beyond questions of war and violence,
[to take in the]{.mark} very [**system** and **infrastructure** of
**global security itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This \"system\" is a
dynamic and contested set of processes that develops out of the
frameworks provided by (and actions of) key structures and
actors**[[:]{.underline}]{.mark}** international treaties and law,
regional and global organisations, governments, militaries, intelligence
and aid agencies, NGOs, corporations, communities, and civil society
organisations. The \"international\" management of security, however,
should not be confused with a genuinely global sensibility, perspective,
practice or set of institutions. Currently, we have a largely
state-centric international security system that attempts very
imperfectly to deal with increasingly global processes and dynamics of
insecurity: risks and threats that have transnational and often global
sources and symptoms. This system is structured around a cooperative
tension (and sometimes outright conflict) between national security
policies and **[[military alliances]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[regional
security organisations]{.underline}** (like ASEAN or the OSCE) [[and
**collective security \"regimes\"**]{.mark} of]{.underline}
international law, [**treaty agreements** and **international
organisations**]{.underline} in areas like arms control, disarmament,
and the environment. These regimes reflect both cosmopolitan commitments
to deal with global problems in an effective and equitable way, and an
uglier power politics that generates compromises that reflect particular
national and corporate (rather than global) interests. Such regimes are
also almost entirely missing or stagnant in areas like the energy and
the world economy. A global approach to security thus recognises that
our common problems are global in scope and that national, regional and
collective security responses need to be reformed to serve genuinely
global ends (Burke 2013a).

In our view, [[the **kind of global security system** we have]{.mark},
how [**and to whom it provides security**, is the **very first ethical
question**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Does this system serve the interests of
states and corporations alone or the interests of all people and the
ecosystems that they depend on? [Does it serve the interests of the
wealthy and powerful, or the poor and the marginalised? Does it serve
the interests of some at an unacceptable cost to others?]{.underline}
[**These concerns preoccupied** a \"**high level** panel\" of **former
states-people**]{.underline} asked by then United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to map out a new global security agenda in
2004. In their report, A More Secure World, [they said:]{.underline}

> [[**Differences** of **power**]{.mark}, wealth [and
> **geography**]{.mark} do [determine what we **perceive as the gravest
> threats** to]{.mark} our survival and well-being. Differences of focus
> lead us to dismiss what others perceive as the gravest of all threats
> to their survival. Inequitable responses to threats further fuel
> division. Many people believe that what passes for **[collective
> security]{.mark}** today is simply a system for protecting the rich
> and powerful]{.underline}. (United Nations 2004: 2)

We believe that **[["ethics"]{.underline}]{.mark}** and "morality" [[are
**not things that can be brought to insecurity**]{.mark} **or war [from
outside, to a space that would otherwise be unethical]{.mark}** or
amoral. **[Rather]{.mark}**]{.underline}, we believe that [**[even
before we face a specific]{.mark} moral [decision]{.mark}**, ethics
[**constitutes** the **choices available**]{.mark} to us---that
particular **ethical** **[commitments]{.mark}**, options, [**limits**
and **imperatives** are **implicit in**]{.mark} the **system** itself,
and in particular [**theoretical** and **policy** **world
views**]{.mark}. Every\' vision, every\' practice, and every\' system of
security has an ethics---even if we cannot agree that all are equally
ethical]{.underline}. As Richard Shapcott argues, [[any work]{.mark} of
political ethics]{.underline}

> [[**must draw attention** to the]{.mark} possible
> **[consequences]{.mark}** or implications [of **different starting
> points**]{.mark}]{.underline}\...[[it is **only once** we have
> **assessed**]{.mark} or understood [**these \[consequences\]** that we

> [**[whether]{.mark}** we think [the **costs** of **our positions** are
> **worth it, or not**]{.mark}, or whether they are justifiable or need
> modification]{.underline}. (Shapcott 2010: uii-ihiii)

In sum, [even as we accept that to be able to term a perspective or
behaviour "amoral", "immoral", or "unethical" is a powerful and
sometimes legitimate use of language, [it is **analytically more
helpful** to]{.mark} be able to **[lay out the assumptions]{.mark}** and
commitments of a range of ethical frameworks that bear on the problems
and realities of global security, [so that **their effects** can
be]{.mark} considered and **[judged]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even as we
assume a responsibility to advance a distinctive global security ethics
that is better---that will lead to a more just and stable world---we do
so in a global political context where moral pluralism is a fact.
[[**Debate** among **competing ethical perspectives** is **necessary**
and **important**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

In Defence of Theory

However widespread it might be, [the [notion that **IR's lack of
practical relevance stems from excessive theorising**]{.mark} rests
[more]{.mark} on]{.underline} vigorous [[**assertion**
than]{.underline}]{.mark} weighty **[[evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
As noted above, we lack good data on the field's practical relevance,
and the difficulties establishing appropriate measures are all too
apparent in the fraught attempts by several governments to quantify the
impact of the humanities and social sciences more generally. Beyond
this, though, [we lack any credible evidence that any fluctuations in
the field's relevance are due to more or less high theory]{.underline}.
We hear that policymakers complain of not being able to understand or
apply much that appears in our leading journals, but it is unclear why
we should be any more concerned about this than physicists or
economists, who take theory, even high theory, to be the bedrock of
advancement in knowledge. Moreover, [there is now a **wealth of
[research]{.mark}**, inside and outside **IR**, that [shows]{.mark} that
[**policy communities** are **not**]{.mark} open epistemic or cognitive
realms, **[simply awaiting]{.mark} well-communicated, [non-jargonistic
knowledge]{.mark}** -- [they are **bureaucracies**, **deeply susceptible
to groupthink**]{.mark}, that filter information through their own
intersubjective frames]{.underline}. 10

Beyond this, however, [there are [good reasons to believe]{.mark} that
**precisely the reverse** of the **theory versus relevance** thesis
might be **true**; that **[theoretical inquiry]{.mark}** may be [a
**necessary prerequisite** for the generation of **practically relevant
knowledge**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I will focus here on the value of
metatheory, as this attracts most contemporary criticism and would
appear the most difficult of theoretical forms to defend.

Metatheories take other theories as their subject. Indeed, their
precepts establish the conditions of possibility for second-order
theories. In general, metatheories divide into three broad categories:
epistemology, ontology and meta-ethics. The first concerns the nature,
validity and acquisition of knowledge; the second, the nature of being
(what can be said to exist, how things might be categorised and how they
stand in relation to one another); and the third, the nature of right
and wrong, what constitutes moral argument, and how moral arguments
might be sustained. Second-order theories are constructed within, and on
the basis of, assumptions formulated at the metatheoretical level.
[Epistemological assumptions about what constitutes legitimate knowledge
and how it is legitimately acquired delimit the questions we ask and the
kinds of information we can enlist in answering them]{.underline}. 11
[Can social scientists ask normative questions?]{.underline} Is
literature a valid source of social-scientific knowledge? Ontological
assumptions about the nature and distinctiveness of the social universe
affect not only what we 'see' but also how we order what we see; how we
relate the material to the ideational, agents to structures, interests
to beliefs, and so on. [If we assume, for example, that individuals are
rational actors, engaged in the efficient pursuit of primarily material
interests, then phenomena such as faith-motivated politics will remain
at the far periphery]{.underline} of our vision. 12 Lastly, meta-ethical
assumptions about the nature of the good, and about what constitutes a
valid moral argument, frame how we reason about concrete ethical
problems. Both deontology and consequentialism are meta-ethical
positions, operationalised, for example, in the differing arguments of
Charles Beitz and Peter Singer on global distributive justice. 13

[Most scholars would acknowledge the background, structuring role that
metatheory plays, but argue that we can take our metatheoretical
assumptions off the shelf, get on with the serious business of research
and leave explicit metatheoretical reflection and debate to the
philosophers]{.underline}. [If practical relevance is one of our
concerns, however, there are several reasons why this is
misguided]{.underline}.

Firstly, [whether IR is practically relevant depends]{.underline}, in
large measure, [on the kinds of questions that animate our
research]{.underline}. I am not referring here to the commonly held
notion that we should be addressing questions that practitioners want
answered. Indeed, [our work will at times be **most relevant** when we
pursue questions that **policymakers**]{.underline} and others [would
**prefer left buried**]{.underline}. My point is a different one, which
I return to in greater detail below. It is sufficient to note here that
[being practically relevant involves asking questions of practice; not
just retrospective questions about past practices]{.underline} -- their
nature, sources and consequences -- but [prospective questions about
what human agents should do]{.underline}. As I have argued elsewhere,
being practically relevant means asking questions of how we, ourselves,
or some other actors (states, policymakers, citizens, NGOs, IOs, etc.)
should act. 14 [Yet our ability, nay willingness, to ask such questions
is determined by the metatheoretical assumptions that structure our
research and arguments]{.underline}. This is partly an issue of ontology
-- what we see affects how we understand the conditions of action,
rendering some practices possible or impossible, mandatory or beyond the
pale. [**[If]{.mark}**, for example, [we **think**]{.mark} that
[**political change is driven by material forces**, then we are
**unlikely to see communicative practices**]{.mark} of argument and
persuasion [as]{.mark} potentially **[successful sources of
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [More than this]{.underline}, though, [it
is also an issue of **epistemology**. [**If** we **assume**]{.mark} that
[the proper domain of **IR**]{.mark} as a social science [is the
**acquisition** of **empirically verifiable knowledge**]{.mark}, then
[we **will struggle to comprehend, let alone answer, normative
questions**]{.mark} of how we should act]{.underline}. We [will either
**[reduce 'ought']{.mark} questions [to 'is']{.mark} questions**, or
place them **off the agenda altogether**]{.underline}. 15 [Our
**metatheoretical assumptions** thus **determine the macro-orientation
of IR** towards questions of practice, **directly affecting** the
field's **practical relevance**]{.underline}.

Secondly, metatheoretical revolutions license new second-order
theoretical and analytical possibilities while foreclosing others,
directly affecting those forms of scholarship widely considered most
practically relevant. The rise of analytical eclecticism illustrates
this. As noted above, Katzenstein and Sil's call for a pragmatic
approach to the study of world politics, one that addresses real-world
problematics by combining insights from diverse research traditions,
resonates with the mood of much of the field, especially within the
American mainstream. Epistemological and ontological debates are widely
considered irresolvable dead ends, grand theorising is unfashionable,
and gladiatorial contests between rival paradigms appear, increasingly,
as unimaginative rituals. Boredom and fatigue are partly responsible for
this new mood, but something deeper is at work. Twenty-five years ago,
Sil and Katzenstein's call would have fallen on deaf ears; the neo-neo
debate that preoccupied the American mainstream occurred within a
metatheoretical consensus, one that combined a neo-positivist
epistemology with a rationalist ontology. This singular metatheoretical
framework defined the rules of the game; analytical eclecticism was
unimaginable. The Third Debate of the 1980s and early 1990s destabilised
all of this; not because American IR scholars converted in their droves
to critical theory or **[[poststructuralism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (far
from it), but because metatheoretical absolutism became less and less
tenable. The anti-foundationalist critique of the idea that there is any
single measure of truth [did **not** produce a wave of
**relativism**]{.underline}, but it did generate a widespread sense that
battles on the terrain of epistemology were unwinnable. Similarly, the
Third Debate emphasis on identity politics and cultural particularity,
which later found expression in constructivism, did not vanquish
rationalism. It did, however, establish a more pluralistic, if
nevertheless heated, debate about ontology, a terrain on which many
scholars felt more comfortable than that of epistemology. One can
plausibly argue, therefore, that the metatheoretical struggles of the
Third Debate [**created a space** for -- even **[made possible]{.mark}**
-- the rise of **analytical eclecticism** and its **aversion to
metatheoretical absolutes**, a **principal benefit** of which is said to
be **[greater practical relevance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Lastly, [most of us would agree that for [our **research**]{.mark} to be
**practically relevant**, it **[has to be good]{.mark}** -- it has to be
[the product of]{.mark} **sound inquiry**, and our conclusions have to
be plausible]{.underline}. The pluralists among us would also agree that
different research questions require different methods of inquiry and
strategies of argument. Yet [across this diversity there are several
practices widely recognised as essential to good research]{.underline}.
[Among these are]{.underline} clarity of purpose, [logical coherence,
**engagement with alternative arguments** and the provision of **good
reasons**]{.underline} (empirical evidence, corroborating arguments
textual interpretations, etc.). [Less often noted, however, is the
importance of **[metatheoretical reflexivity]{.mark}**. If our
**epistemological assumptions affect the questions we ask**, then
**being conscious of these assumptions is necessary** to ensure that we
are not fencing off questions of importance, and that if we are, we can
justify our choices]{.underline}. [Likewise, if our ontological
assumptions affect how we see the social universe, determining what is
in or outside our]{.underline} field of vision
\[**[awareness]{.underline}**\], [then reflecting on these assumptions
can [prevent us being]{.mark}]{.underline} blind to \[**[[unaware
of]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] **[[things that
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A similar argument applies to our
meta-ethical assumptions. Indeed, if deontology and consequentialism are
both meta-ethical positions, as I suggested earlier, then [reflecting on
our choice of one or other position is [**part and parcel** of
**weighing rival ethical arguments**]{.mark} (on issues as diverse as
global poverty and human rights)]{.underline}. Finally, [our
epistemological, ontological and meta-ethical assumptions are not
metatheoretical silos; assumptions we make in one have a tendency to
shape those we make in another]{.underline}. The oft-heard refrain that
'if we can't measure it, it doesn't matter' is an unfortunate example of
epistemology supervening on ontology, something that metatheoretical
reflexivity can help guard against. In sum, [like clarity, coherence,
consideration of alternative arguments and the provision of good
reasons, metatheoretical reflexivity is part of keeping us honest,
making it practically relevant despite its abstraction]{.underline}.

### AT: Scenario Analysis Good

#### [Scenario analysis]{.underline} is [itself]{.underline} what we're critiquing, and [drives our impacts]{.underline} -- does [NOT challenge stereotypes]{.underline}, rather [magnifies]{.underline} and [empowers]{.underline} them to [self-authorize violence]{.underline} through surveillance, policing and intervention

**Hogue 15** Simon Houge, PhD candidate, philosophy, McGill University,
MA linguistics, University of Ottowa, "Ubiquitous surveillance for
paranoid security apparatus, or how mass security surveillance threatens
the democratic space of revelation and deliberation," paper presented at
the CPSA Annual Conference, 6-24-2015

[**[Securing]{.mark} through risk** [is **based on**]{.mark} an **act of
[imagination]{.mark}:** that [of **future
threats**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Security
**[experts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or "managers of unease", [[must think
of]{.mark} the possible and, more importantly, not so possible threats,
those almost [unthinkable plots that would bring]{.mark} the [greater
damages]{.mark}]{.underline} (Salter, 2008). Uncertainty provides for a
logical foundation to imagination: [[the]{.mark} **absolute
[impossibility to know]{.mark}** the future [means]{.mark} that **[all
scenarios must be anticipated]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Amoore & De Goede,
2008b). [This process of imaginative thinking, or **premediation**, is
**[not about forecasting correctly]{.mark}** the future]{.underline}.
Grusin explains: "premediation \... is not necessarily about getting the
future right [as much as it is about trying to imagine or **map out as
many possible futures as could plausibly be imagined**]{.underline}" (De
Goede, 2008a). [Once imagined these possible futures **become the basis
for present actions**. The visualization of these futures allow for
**[planning scenarios]{.mark}** and acting in the present to avoid them
from happening in the future]{.underline}. For Marieke de Goede,
[premediation is for this reason **highly problematic**:]{.underline}
Perhaps precisely because of its ability to foster current action, we
could argue that [**premediation** [has **itself** **become the
catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Coutin, 2008). [Not only does
[**security premediation** offer a **fantasy of control**]{.mark} and
rational management of the uncertain future [that '**depoliticises the
limits of knowledge**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Best, 2006: 13--14); [more
worrying still is the fact that **premediation is performative**. This
does not mean that disastrous imagined futures will inevitably play out,
but it does mean that [the **imagination of some scenarios over
others**]{.mark}, the visualization of some futures and not others,
[entails **profoundly political** work that **enables and constrains
political decisionmaking in the present**]{.mark}]{.underline} (De
Goede, 2008a, p. 171) In this context, the use of algorithms to
visualize these scenarios [**[accentuates]{.mark}** the importance of
predetermined data (and [**fear** and **stereotypes**]{.mark}) by
raising attention to some while ignoring others]{.underline}. [The
attention raised]{.underline} by algorithms [[validates **not actual
threats**, but the **info**]{.mark}**rmation [deemed relevant]{.mark}**
in the imagined scenarios]{.underline}. Amoore explains: In effect,
algorithms precisely function as a means of directing and disciplining
attention, focusing on specific points and cancelling out all other
data, appearing to make it possible to translate probable associations
between people or objects into actionable security decisions\... In this
sense, the algorithm [produces a screened visualization of suspicion[,
on the basis of which **'other' people** are intercepted]{.mark},
detained, stopped and searched]{.underline} (Amoore, 2009, p. 22). In
brief, [the **security surveillance apparatus** works from an
algorithmic, intuitive reality **based on imagination** and
**"confirmed" by dissected and reassembled data** that form profiles of
safe or threatening dividuals]{.underline}. In a sense, relying on a
fictitious world is not illogical since history has proved that one
cannot trust what it sees. But [this generates a **double problem**: the
algorithmic visualization of intuitive scenarios [constrains the
apparatus to **see only the predetermined
scenario**]{.mark}]{.underline} that reappears in their algorithms
(Amoore, 2009; 2011). [These scenarios become similar to
[**self-fulfilling prophecies** that **cannot be proved wrong**]{.mark}
since risk may always spring from an uncertain world]{.underline}. In
addition, to use de Goede's words again, "**[Premediation]{.underline}**
has the ability to [**[foster societal fragilities]{.mark}** and
resentment, [while **disregarding its present victims as 'collateral
damage'**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (De Goede, 2008a, p. 171). [**Today's
victims represent [the potential threats in a scenario that did not
happen, but]{.mark} that [always can]{.mark}**. As such, they are
**never freed of suspicion**]{.underline}.

All strands of critical theory, in sum, have undergone considerable
theoretical development over the course of their operation in IR. And
far from representing some ahistorical theoretical flight of fancy,
these developments clearly run parallel with and address contemporaneous
historical dynamics. [Critical theories]{.underline}, in short, [are
neither substantively nor theoretically out of sync with
history]{.underline}.

Hence, [I will now investigate the]{.underline} second
[claim]{.underline}, also in two parts: [that critical theories have
been politically irrelevant]{.underline}---because they failed to
provide empirical studies of pressing political problems. Have critical
theorists "empirically" analyzed "pressing political problems?" To
answer this question, I will treat as "pressing political problems"
issues that were widely discussed in mainstream academic and public
debates and as "empirical" analysis methods such as ethnographic
fieldwork and interviews as well as the analysis of documents, pictures,
statistics, and so on.

[**Critical IR scholarship** systematically provides **empirical
analyses** of pressing political problems from the 1980s
onward]{.underline}. In the context of the Second Cold War and the peace
movement, feminists used fieldwork and empirical research to investigate
strategic discourses (Cohn, 1987) as well as the reproduction of gender
inequality in and through military service (Yuval-Davis, 1985). Among
the most pressing political issues arising at the end of the Cold War
were the Yugoslav wars. While feminists conducted interviews and used
statistics to study the systematic use of rape in those wars
(Stiglmayer, 1994), [**poststructuralists** analyzed]{.underline} their
**[media representations]{.underline}** (Campbell, 1998). Marxists
challenged dominant discourses on globalization by empirically comparing
the integration of the world economy in the 1990s with that at the end
of the 19th century (Hirst and Thompson, 1996) while feminists exposed
the gendered nature of global governance by studying policy documents of
international organizations (Meyer and Prügl, 1999). Feminist and
postcolonial [[scholars]{.underline}]{.mark} also undertook fieldwork in
Somalia (Miller and Moskos, 1995) [and **[analyzed]{.mark}**
international legal [**texts** regarding]{.mark} the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (**[NATO]{.mark}**) intervention]{.underline} in
Kosovo (Orford, 1999).

In the early 2000s, 9/11 raised a host of important issues addressed by
critical scholars. Thus, we find the empirical analysis of different
cases of political self-sacrifice (Fierke, 2012), a poststructuralist
investigation of the Muhammad cartoon crisis (Hansen, 2011), analysis of
the role of enemy images in the case of Iraq (Dodge, 2012), and legal
implications of preemption in the war on terror (De Goede, 2008). There
are empirical investigations of counter-terrorism policies and programs
like Prevent and Channel (Martin, 2018) as well as of British
involvement in prisoner abuse through the rendition program (Blakeley
and Raphael, 2017). The analysis of media and policy documents
demonstrates the role of gender in the justification of the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan and the importance of women as targets and practicioners
in counter-insurgency (Dyvik, 2014). This development of a militarized
femininity is also explored through the role of women prisoners of war
and women prison guards in the Iraq war (Sjoberg, 2007).

In addition, critical scholars empirically investigated the AIDS crisis
and its impact on security and governmentality (Elbe, 2009). The
financial crisis and rising inequality are widely explored through
economic data (Knafo, 2009; McNally, 2010) and their political impact in
the case of Brexit and Trump linked to electoral statistics (Rosenberg
and Boyle, 2019). [Critical IR scholars have also provided in-depth
empirical analyses of]{.underline} concrete human rights struggles and
their consequences (Odysseos, 2011) and of [arms trade and licensing
strategies]{.underline} (Stavrianakis, 2008).

In short, critical scholars have systematically analyzed "pressing
political problems" and they have regularly done so using "empirical"
methods. It therefore now remains to determine whether this work has
remained politically sterile. I will show that [critical theories have
[made]{.mark} a **[significant]{.mark} contribution** to different types
of **[political impact]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

I will begin with the impact of critical theories on their home ground:
academia. Higher education in general and universities in particular, it
is worth recalling, are integral to the division of labor in
contemporary societies (Campbell and Bleiker, 2016: 210). [Since their
entry into **IR**]{.underline} in the 1980s, [critical theories have
**radically transformed the field**. Today, [**IR textbooks** regularly
contain]{.mark} chapters on]{.underline} Marxist, feminist,
**[[poststructuralist]{.underline}]{.mark}**, postcolonial---and
sometimes even generically [critical---[theories]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Baylis et al., 2017; Sterling-Folker, 2013). [[Proponents]{.mark} of
these critical approaches now [**occupy chairs** in **IR**]{.mark} (and
**Politics**) **[departments]{.mark}**]{.underline} (University of
Sussex, 2018). Critical scholarship like postcolonialism has led to the
establishment of entirely new fields of study like Black Studies in the
United Kingdom (Andrews, 2016) and Africana Studies in the United States
(Cornell University, n.d.). [Critical scholarship is today [published in
**mainstream journals**]{.mark}]{.underline}---from International
Studies Quarterly to the European Journal of International
Relations---and it has its own outlets like Security Dialogue or
International Political Sociology, the latter endorsed as an
International Studies Association (ISA) publication. Professional IR
associations have Global South, Women's and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual,
Transgender, Queer, Asexual (LGBTQA) caucuses (ISA, n.d.). [Academics
decolonize education, the classroom, the University]{.underline}
(Kennedy, 2017), [ensure that women are represented on appointments
committees, and rule out male-only panels at their
conferences]{.underline} (European International Studies Association
(EISA), n.d.). [**[Even if]{.mark} mainstream approaches and [positivism
remain dominant]{.mark}** in academia in general and **IR in
particular**, therefore, critical theories [have **radically
transformed**]{.mark} the discipline's understanding of and approaches
to [the **study of IR**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rengger and
Thirkell-White, 2007: 5). [And they have **contributed to a shift in
power relations** as well as to **organizational and cultural reform
within academic institutions**]{.underline}.

[But the **[political impact]{.mark}** of critical theories [is **not
restricted to academia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Critical theories have
played an important role in **[shifting public perception]{.mark}** in a
variety of issue areas thus [empowering **social
movements**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Marxist2 and postcolonial studies, for
instance, widely challenged the hegemonic discourse on globalization
thus [[contributing to]{.mark} the anti-globalization movement, to
protests against neoliberal economic and development
policies]{.underline} (Krishna, 2000: 155--156), [to climate change
**[negotiations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Saran, 2015) [as well as
[informing]{.mark} refugee and migration
**[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bilgic, 2018).

Postcolonial analyses of the way in which representation and memory
serve to uphold unequal power relations has informed protest movements
for quite some time---from the naming of the Woodrow Wilson School of
Public and International Affairs at Princeton (Fisher, 2015) through the
"Rhodes must fall" movement in Oxford and Cape Town to reviews of a
number of public statues associated with colonialism, racism, and
genocide from Australia to New York (Mudditt, 2017; NYT Editorial,
2017). [These **movements are [currently sweeping]{.mark} across
[the]{.mark} entire [globe]{.mark}**, [leading to **significant policy
changes**]{.mark}]{.underline} (The New York Times, 2020). Similarly,
[[**poststructuralist** work]{.underline}]{.mark} like Cynthia Weber's
film I Am an American (Weber, 2007) [is [an integral part of **public
debate**]{.mark} on the openDemocracy website while James **DerDerian's
documentaries** have **won awards** at major film festivals and are the
subject of national newspaper reports]{.underline} (Der Derian, n.d.).

Academic theories have also influenced political parties and topical
issues like Brexit lately. The work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal
Mouffe, also influential in IR, played a role in the development of new
parties like Podemos in Spain or Syriza in Greece (Hancox, 2015; Judis,
2016). Similarly, Marxist arguments feed into Lexit---leftist arguments
for Brexit (McFadyen, 2017; Zagoria, 2017).

In addition, individual critical scholars actively participate in a wide
range of political projects. Teivo Teivainen set up the Network
Institute for Global Democratization (NIGD, n.d.) and is an active
member of the World Social Forum (Teivainen, 2018). The scholar-activist
network Transnational Institute has been supported by IR scholars like
Fred Halliday, Boris Kagarlitsky, Richard Falk, Achin Vanaik (TNI,
n.d.). Poststructuralists are actively engaged in the "Righting
Corporate Wrongs" campaign (Coleman, 2015).

[Not limited to social and protest movements, critical theory has also
**shaped the policies of governments and international
organizations**]{.underline}. Postcolonial and feminist thought, for
instance, is reflected in the Equality Act passed by the British
Government in 2010 (Equality Act 2010, 2020) just as gender, LGBT, and
queer studies have paved the way for the integration of women into the
military and the repeal of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policies in the
American military in 2010. Similarly, feminist work3 led to the
recognition of rape as a war crime in the International Criminal Court
(ICC, Rome Statute, n.d.) and to the integration of policies addressing
sexual and gender-based violence into humanitarian policies (Veit,
2018). In 1995, the UN Human Development Programme adopted the Gender
Development Index (GDI). It also led to the adoption of gender
mainstreaming by the United Nations (UN) and nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and in 1996 the International Labour Organization
(ILO) adopted international standards for home-based work that largely
impacts on women (Tickner, 2011: 273). [Critical scholars serve as
experts on governmental committees on human rights and arms
trade]{.underline} (Stavrianakis, 2015) [and their work on the
environment is taken up at the UN]{.underline} (Newell, 2020; Newell and
Simms, 2020).

[Critical theories have thus been [**successful** in leading to **legal
and political change**]{.mark} within and between
societies]{.underline}. In doing so, however, they have also become part
of the establishment. As Alex Veit shows, the integration of a response
to sexual and gender-based violence into humanitarian policies
simultaneously entails an integration into a wider liberal governance
strategy---thus providing opportunities for the improvement of
beneficiaries' lives but not for the radical transformation of gender
relations in society as a whole (Veit, 2018). Similarly, the treatment
of women is now used as a justification for war or intervention, in
Afghanistan for instance, while International Financial Institutions use
gay rights to cast their economic policies in a progressive light (Rao,
2015). Critical thought is thus widely---albeit variably---reflected in
public debate, in political struggles, and in the law and policies of
powerful states and institutions---where it now also serves dominant
governance purposes. The same is true for academia itself. [Erstwhile
critical approaches like **[securitization theory]{.mark}** become part
of the academic establishment and begin to attract critical
scrutiny]{.underline} (Howell and Richter-Montpetit, 2020).

In sum, [the empirical evidence shows that critical IR theories have,
over the past (almost) 40 years, been closely aligned to historical
developments and conducted empirical research into serious political
issues]{.underline}. Above all, [the **[empirical evidence]{.mark}**
undermines the claim that **critical theories** have had **no political
relevance**. It [shows]{.mark}, on the contrary, that **critical
theories** have [**shaped a wide range** of]{.mark} political
[**principles**, **practices**, and
**institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Yet, these empirical findings do not indicate that the debate about the
fate of critical theory today is unfounded. Instead, they help us
formulate the puzzle more accurately: How do we account for the
widespread sense of disappointment among critical theorists in light of
these achievements?

Critical theory in theory

In order to make sense of this tension, I will now trace the changing
conception of critical theory over time and show that in the course of
its inevitable engagement with political practice, critical theory loses
sight of its core metatheoretical principles. Critical theories become
integrated into the mainstream and thus lose the ability to inspire
visions of an alternative society. And it is this loss, not despite but
because of the empirical successes of critical theory, that accounts for
the current disappointment. What is more, I will show, the solutions
offered to address this problem today tend to reflect the specific
pressures of neoliberalism and lead to the subsumption of critical
theory under the current hegemonic forces.

The term critical theory as used in professional academia today was
originally coined by Max Horkheimer. Horkheimer's essay Traditionelle
und Kritische Theorie (1937, republished in 1968) provides a useful
starting point not only because it offers its first systematic
conceptualization but also because it was motivated by the same question
as the current debate. Confronted with the rise of Nazism, Horkheimer
asked how it was possible that the sciences, supposedly based on reason,
did not present an obstacle to the development of an utterly
unreasonable society. What made the co-existence of science and national
socialism possible? According to Horkheimer, the answer lay in certain
features of "traditional theory" and he designed "critical theory"
specifically to preclude such complicity. And yet, today it seems that
critical theory has been unable to prevent the rise of populism. The
current debate is therefore motivated by the parallel question: what
makes the coexistence of critical theory and populism possible, and what
resources does critical theory offer to confront this challenge?

Such parallels are, of course, dependent on drawing historical and
theoretical lines---between the rise of fascism in the 1920s and 1930s
and populism today, and between Horkheimer's conception of critical
theory and critical IR theories today. The historical claim of
comparability is contested but it has given rise to a revival of
interest in the Frankfurt School (Guyer, 2020; Illing, 2016; Ross,
2016).4 This interest is relevant for us in two ways. First, Horkheimer
identifies core principles of critical theory that also explicitly
characterized early conceptions of critical theory in IR---and it is
these same principles that are fundamentally contested in the current
debate. The fate of these principles over time thus provides a
historical thread that meaningfully connects Horkheimer's work to the
current debate. Second, Horkheimer theorizes the historical logic of
critical theory and thus provides tools for its analysis today.
Horkheimer's conception of critical theory, in short, serves as an
analytical resource providing historical reference points and
theoretical tools rather than authoritative definitions.

I will begin by reconstructing Horkheimer's conception and its
difference to "mainstream" theory. The next step shows that critical IR
theories of all strands originally subscribed to the same core
principles---that are now, however, under serious attack. Following
Horkheimer's theorization of the historical dynamic of critical theory,
the last section shows that it is the practical alignment with
neoliberalism that engenders calls to discard these critical principles.

At the core of Horkheimer's conceptualization of critical theory lies
the relationship between theory and practice---specifically, between
science and national socialism. He argued that their coexistence was
made possible by positivist theory in three main ways. First, positivism
presupposes a separation between thinking and reality, reason and
society. Ideally, theory serves to bridge this gap: to provide a
theoretical explanation of that reality in the form of causal
connections---hypotheses---which then need to be empirically tested
(Horkheimer, 1968: 16--17). Yet, this assumption overlooks, according to
Horkheimer, that thinking itself is shaped by society and changes over
time---hence that thinking and reality cannot be separated.

Second, positivism claims that its language is, in principle,
universally valid, that it can be applied to all areas of knowledge. As
long as one makes sure that all the individual elements of a particular
theory are true (i.e. empirically substantiated) and logically
connected, one can work one's way up from the simplest objects of
cognition to the most complex ones (Horkheimer, 1968: 13). Horkheimer
points out, however, that if reason is indeed independent of
reality---as positivism assumes---then positivist science is completely
self-referential: it can only ever test its own theories rather than
determine or explain extra-scientific purposes. Hence, the inhumane
purposes of Nazi society made no difference to the process of theorizing
while, conversely, the scientific process never presented an obstacle to
the development of national socialism (Horkheimer, 1968: 18).

Finally, the purpose of positivist science is to make as much empirical
knowledge as possible useful to society---rather like a library catalog
without which the accumulated books and articles cannot be accessed and
used (Horkheimer, 1968: 13). However, since positivist science cannot
grasp society's purposes, it is useful only with reference to the
existing purposes of society. The Nazis could make use of science
despite, or indeed for, their inhumane purposes because the latter did
not appear within the scientific process (Horkheimer, 1968: 18).

Horkheimer therefore concludes that the positivist separation of reason
and reality provided the basis for the coexistence of science and
national socialism: by "failing to fail," by allowing reason to exist
within a fundamentally unjust and violent society, the sciences
contributed to making the latter "respectable." And he locates this
separation of reason and reality in a particular historical context.
Liberal capitalist society, he argues, is not directed by a plan,
governed by a particular authority, or oriented toward a common goal.
Instead, the whole of liberal society emerges simply as the result of a
myriad of particular relationships, as the result of competition between
different individuals and groups (Horkheimer, 1968: 22, 24--25). As long
as the whole of society is unreasonable, therefore, reason cannot come
into its own (Horkheimer, 1968: 27--29, 36).

This analysis, whether or not it does justice to positivism, provides
the basis for Horkheimer's elaboration of critical theory. The
shortcomings of positivism imply that science has to overcome the
separation of reason and reality if it wants to present an obstacle to
violence and injustice. But this would require a transformation of
society as a whole---whose unreasonable nature constitutes this
separation. Alas, since society is constituted through a division of
labor of which the sciences are an integral part, they cannot help but
participate in its reproduction (Horkheimer, 1968: 19). [Any substantive
vision of a better society is]{.underline} thus [rooted in, the product
of, and limited by the existing---unjust and
violent---society]{.underline}. [This analysis produces two basic
assumptions: First, **[theory is practice]{.mark}**. The sciences
willy-nilly **[play a constitutive role]{.mark}** in and for society,
and hence [there is **no such thing as**]{.mark} **an "ivory
tower"**---**[a sphere of knowledge production detached from political
practice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Second, thinking, science, perception
itself are socially formed: all knowledge is historical]{.underline}
(Horkheimer, 1968: 23). [Critical theory therefore has to operate under
the same limitations as traditional theory: it has no privileged vantage
point, no special methods, no access to the whole of
society]{.underline} (Horkheimer, 1968: 29).

Critical theory thus cannot offer a substantive notion of emancipation
(Horkheimer, 1968: 31). [The emancipatory goal of transforming society
as a whole must instead become a regulative ideal---and this in turn
provides critical theory with two core principles. First, if a
substantive notion of emancipation is only possible for society as a
whole and if this whole is obscured to all parties, then the only way to
honor that goal lies in the refusal to "solve" particular problems
within existing society, to make anything in that society work
"better."]{.underline} Critical theory is suspicious of terms like
"productive," "valuable," "progressive" because they are defined with
reference to the purposes of existing society---rather than its
transformation. [It thus lacks the "pragmatic" character of, and cannot
be "consumed" like, traditional theory]{.underline} (Horkheimer, 1968:
27, 29, 35--36). [Second, critical theory honors the assumption that
reason and society, **knowledge and reality, theory and practice, are
mutually constitutive** by refusing to separate them in the scientific
process. Critical theory therefore **does not analyze problems "out
there"**; it investigates those problems **always through the way in
which they are constituted through knowledge**]{.underline} (Horkheimer,
1968: 36). [Critical theory aims to **change thinking**]{.underline}
(Horkheimer, 1968: 31); [it reflects on the way in which knowledge
production itself is complicit in the constitution of social and
political issues]{.underline}.

### AT: Alt Fails -- Jarvis

#### Jarvis and other grumpy get off my lawn takes, while amusing, are not responsive

**Shapiro 1** Michael J. Shapiro, Professor of Politial Science at the
University of Hawaii, "Review: Pragmatic Critique and Gothic Fiction,"
International Studies Review, 3(1), Spring 2001, pp.126-128, JSTOR
/GoGreen!

D. S. L. Jarvis\'s International Relations and the Challenge of
Postmodern­ism: Defending the Discipline constitutes a radical
alternative to Cochran\'s practice of critique. Manifesting a serious
allergy to critique and especially to what he calls \"postmodernism,\"
Jarvis presumes that he must defend tradi­tional, neopositivist IR
against (in the words of the book jacket) \"the various postmodern and
poststructuralist theories currently sweeping the discipline of
International Relations.\"

To put the matter simply at the outset, [[**Jarvis** appears]{.mark} to
be almost [**entirely ignorant** of the]{.mark} philosophical predicates
of the **[critical IR lit]{.mark}erature** [he attacks]{.mark}. He
invents a model of thought that he finds vulnerable and then proceeds
with his method of argumentation, mostly to scoff at the enemy he has
invented]{.underline}. But Jarvis\'s scoffing amounts to whistling in
the dark. He has entered a field of critique with predicates that are
mysterious to him, and he shows signs of being genuinely anxious about
the consequences of critical work.

[The monster Jarvis creates is a work of fiction]{.underline}, for he
begins with the pre­sumption that postmodern orientations are
\"sweeping\" and therefore threaten­ing the discipline. (I estimate that
roughly one percent of the papers at the annual meeting of the
International Studies Association reference postructural­ist philosophy.)
Returning to the Victorian genre of Gothic fiction in which the
constitutive practice involves two primary roles---the monster and the
victim---Jarvis portrays Richard Ashley as the Frankenstein monster and
the victim as the entire IR discipline. Moreover, Jarvis\'s overwrought
style of characteriza­tion of the dangers of postmodern IR fits Gothic
fiction\'s motivational profile as well. As is noted in Fred Botting\'s
treatment of the genre: \"The terrors and horrors of transgression in
Gothic writing become powerful means to reassert the values of society,
virtue and propriety. . . . They warn of dangers by putting them in
their darkest and most threatening form\" (p. 5).

Why fiction? Jarvis\' makes \"the postmodern\" (which he seems to know
primarily on the basis of rumor, for most of his citations are not to
postructur­alist texts but to thinkers hostile to them) an elastic
category that applies to everything that he perceives to be antagonistic
to his pre-Kantian empiricism. It encompasses most of feminist IR and
anything that uses interpretive method. Although the use of a
deconstructive mode of critique is extremely rare in international
studies (the major practitioner is David Campbell), Jarvis fre­quently
uses the term \"deconstruction\" as a synonym for postmodernist method.
[He **[assumes]{.mark}**, without showing any evidence]{.underline} that
he has read a word of Jacques Derrida\'s writings, [that
[**deconstruction is hostile to theory building** and]{.mark} is
**[opposed to all forms of affirmation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This
characterization is **[belied by]{.mark}**]{.underline} Derrida\'s
statements and demonstrations and by Campbell\'s
[[**deconstruction-inspired writing** on]{.mark} war,
**[security]{.mark}**, and the ethics of responsibility]{.underline}.
Symptomatic of his woeful ignorance of critical work in general, Jarvis
refers at one point to the expression \"structure of feeling\" as a
\"postmodern phrase\" (p. 32). Structure of feeling is initiated in the
work of Raymond Williams, the late (and famous---though not sufficiently
to alert Jarvis) Marxist literary critic whose work cannot be remotely
related to poststructuralist critique and has inspired such prominent
postmod­ernism bashers as Terry Eagleton.

Jarvis\'s ignorance is not confined to contemporary critical
interpretive theory (postmodern or otherwise); it even extends to the
neoempiricist philosophy of science. For example, he chides
postmodernists for holding the outrageous view that theorizing
constitutes fact (p. 27), while he wants to uphold a model in which the
integrity of theory---in international studies or elsewhere---requires
that the domains of theory and fact be understood as radically separate.
One need not resort to a Foucauldian treatment of discourse as event or
a Deleuzian critique of representational thinking to challenge Jarvis\'s
approach to theory. Jarvis\'s view of the theory--data relationship was
seriously impeached by enough neoempiricist philosophers by the 1960s to
field a softball team (among the heavy hitters in the starting lineup
would be Willard V. Quine, Patrick Suppes, and Norwood Russell Hanson).

The critical work for which Jarvis has contempt is not the threat he
imag­ines to \"the discipline,\" unless we construct the IR discipline as
a trained inat­tention to the problematics, within which the work of
theory proceeds. [The writings of Michel Foucault]{.underline} (some of
whose work Jarvis seems to have read) [have implications for a critical
and affirmative perspective that does not com­promise the kind of theory
building that IR empiricists do. [It **extends the
arena**]{.mark}**---[in which to theorize]{.mark}** while
**[encouraging]{.mark} a historical [sensitivity]{.mark}---[to regimes
of discourse]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} suggests an ethico-politics of
freedom from the **impo­sitions of [identity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Although Foucault\'s conception of the **problematic** points to how
**concepts and the modes of fact assigned to them are historically
contin­gent**, explicable in contexts of value, and **complicit with
modes of power and authority**, [this **does not thereby invalidate
theory**. Rather]{.mark}, it **[opens the way to]{.mark} work on the
ethico-political context of theory** and, among other things, to
**[theo­rize with a sensitivity to theory\'s constituencies]{.mark}**
(**[beyond]{.mark}** the **[policymakers]{.mark}** that seem to be
prized by Jarvis)]{.underline}. As Molly Cochran, whose work is based on
knowl­edge and critique rather than rumor and contempt, implies, [[an
**important legacy**]{.mark} of contemporary **critical work** [is the
**expansion of political and moral inclusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Finally, there is one other genre that is (regrettably) embedded in
Jarvis\'s fable of the dangers of postmodernism, a biographical
speculation about a five-year hiatus in Richard Ashley\'s publishing
life. Obsessed with the dangers of postmodernism, Jarvis attributes
these years of silence to the \"deep resigna­tion\" (p. 183) that he
thinks Ashley\'s version of postmodern theorizing invites. Without
insisting on a counterspeculation, I want to point out that Ashley\'s
publishing hiatus coincides with the period shortly after an automobile
accident claimed the life of his wife and seriously maimed his two sons.
At a minimum, the information renders Jarvis\'s biographical fable crass
and uninformed---like the rest of the book.

### AT: Link Inevitable

#### Links are [NOT inevitable]{.underline} -- only seems that way because speech acts such as the 1AC continually reconstitute ["Western" identity]{.underline} through [securitization]{.underline} -- the [ALT solves]{.underline}

**Burke 7** Anthony Burke, Senior Lecturer, School of Politics and
Professor of International Relations, University of New South Wales,
*Beyond Security, Ethics and Violence*, Routledge, 2007, ISBN
978-0-203-96570, p.68-69 /GoGreen!

[This]{.underline} chapter [is]{.underline} thus [an exercise in
thinking, which challenges the continuing power of [political
ontologies]{.mark} (forms of truth and being) that [connect
**security**]{.mark}]{.underline}, sovereignty, [[**belonging**,
**otherness** and **violence** in ways that for many appear like
**enduring political facts**, **inevitable**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
irrefutable. Conflict, violence and alienation then arise not merely
from individual or collective acts whose conditions might be understood
and policed; they condition politics as such, forming a permanent
ground, a dark substrata underpinning the very possibility of the
present. [Conflict and alienation [**seem inevitable** because of the
way]{.mark} in which the modem [**political imagination** has conceived
and **thought security**]{.mark}, sovereignty and ethics]{.underline}.
Israel/ Palestine is chosen here as a particularly urgent and complex
example of this problem, but it is a problem with much wider
significance.

While I hold out the hope that [[**security can be re-visioned** **away
from** a **permanent dependence** on]{.mark} insecurity, [**exclusion**
and **violence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and I believe it retains
normative promise, this analysis takes a deliberate step backward to
examine the very real barriers faced by such a project. Security cannot
properly be rethought without a deeper understanding of, and challenge
to, the political forms and structures it claims to enable and protect.
If Ken Booth argues that the state should be a means rather than an end
of security, my objective here is to place the continuing power and
depth of its status as an end of security, and a fundamental source for
political identity, under critical interrogation.\' If the state is to
become a means of security (one among many) it will have to be
fundamentally transformed.

The chapter pursues this inquiry in two stages. The first outlines the
historic strength and effective redundancy of such an exciusivist vision
of security in Israel, wherein Israel not only confronts military and
political antagonists with an \'iron wall\' of armed force but maps this
onto a profound clash of existential narratives, a problem with
resonances in the West\'s confrontation with radical Islamism in the war
on terror. The second, taking up the remainder of the chapter, then
explores a series of potential resources in continental [philosophy and
political [theory]{.mark}]{.underline} that might [[help us to **think
our way out**]{.mark} of a **security** grounded in violence and
alienation]{.underline}. [Through a [critical engagement]{.mark} with
this thought]{.underline}, I aim [to [construct a political ethics based
not in relations between insecure and separated
identities]{.underline}]{.mark} [mapped solely onto nation-states, [but
in relations of responsibility]{.mark} and interconnection that can
negotiate and recognise both distinct and intertwined histories,
identities and needs; an ethics that might underpin a vision of
interdependent (national and non-national) existence proper to an
integrated world traversed by endless flows of people, commerce, ideas,
violence and future potential]{.underline}.

### AT: Floating PICs Bad

#### [No link]{.underline} -- we're [NOT a floating PIC]{.underline} -- no part of the ALT advocates security cooperation with NATO -- because there's no version of it that can avoid being framed by "Western" identity -- BUT that does NOT mean transatlantic cooperation is impossible, NOR that nothing can be done to solve their advantage impacts -- our argument is simply that [by debating representations]{.underline}, we come to [understand unintended consequences better]{.underline}, and through creativity and reflexivity, can figure out ways of thinking and acting that mitigate those consequences -- that's Bacchi

#### [No impact]{.underline} -- it's no different than saying the states counterplan spills up, or a pilot program is modelled -- [their burden]{.underline} to win their advantages are intrinsic to the plan, and there's no other way to solve them, is the same as answering any advantage counterplan

### ALT -- Security/NATO PIC

#### The alternative is [cooperation]{.underline} (minus security/NATO) -- it's NOT incompatible with [alliances]{.underline}, NOR [policy engagement]{.underline} -- BUT the [solidarity]{.underline} required to [actually provide peace]{.underline} is [mutually exclusive]{.underline} with [NATO]{.underline} and [security cooperation]{.underline}

People-centred solutions for peace

Beyond this immediate context, action is needed to prevent future armed
conflict and threats of nuclear war.

[Instead of maintaining opposing military alliances, all parties should
engage in building a common, demilitarised security strategy that places
cooperation and the collective fulfilment of the needs of people and
planet in the forefront of all policies and actions.
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example, [[**should be disbanded**
and]{.mark} non-militarised, [**non-divisive alliances** for]{.mark}
peace and [**cooperation** should be **built instead**, with
**international solidarity** as its **guiding
principle**]{.mark}]{.underline}. All countries should reduce their
military spending immediately, and agree to phased reductions through
the implementation of Article 26 of the UN Charter, the mandate for
which should be taken from the UN Security Council and given to the UN
General Assembly.

All countries should join the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons and work urgently for the timebound elimination of all nuclear
weapons. [Through the treaty's provisions for disarmament, the
elimination of nucelar weapons could be pursued through verifiable
process and achieved within a decade. [The **process**]{.mark} of
nuclear weapon abolition could [provide a]{.mark} foundational [path to
**broader changes** in]{.mark} the **[world
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Eliminating nuclear weapons
[[would]{.mark} help [establish a new **cooperative paradigm**]{.mark}
in international relations [and **free up resources**]{.mark} help
[address the **climate crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It would
[also]{.mark} help [**generate momentum** for broader **disarmament**
and **demilitarisation**]{.mark} and redirection of money and human
ingenuity towards meeting human and planetary needs]{.underline}.

[At the core of our efforts, we must put the lives of civilians and care
for the planet above perceived military, political, and economic
interests]{.underline}. To this end, a people-centred peace process is
imperative. As Almut Rochowanaski writes, "We must apply the lessons of
21st-century peacebuilding to create a peace process that is
people-centred, women-led and rights-based." [[Without this,
"**patterns** of **exclusion** and **victimisation** will]{.mark} not be
remedied, and memories of pain and injustice will [turn into
**grievance** and **alienation** **lasting
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A **broad range of stakeholders**
can be heard and validated through **[proven peacebuilding
practices]{.mark}**, and [can]{.mark} go on to **[build a different
future]{.mark}**]{.underline} for their country."

[In the Ukraine context, we [echo the]{.mark} call of the **[Ukrainian
Pacificist Movement]{.mark}** for "open, inclusive and comprehensive
negotiations on peace and disarmament in the format of a public dialogue
between all state and non-state parties to the conflict with the
participation of pro-peace civil society actors." This type of
**[inclusive process]{.mark}**, a process that is not driven or
dominated by those who created the crisis in the first place, [must be
**applied to other contexts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We know that more
inclusive processes [lead to **more stable peace**]{.mark}, [yet]{.mark}
time after time, [only men with guns dictate]{.mark} the terms of
["peace"]{.mark}. These solutions [**invariably** lead to]{.mark} the
imposition of **neoliberal economic policies**, **[gender and racial
oppressions]{.mark} and inequalities**, [and **endless
militarisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The old ways of doing things have proven over and over again that they
do no work. [We need a new vision of global peace, grounded in the
intersectional experiences of people and the needs of the entire
planet]{.underline}. [Creating and achieving that vision requires
changing who is invited to the table: out with the ruling elites, who
are bound to personal interests and gains, and in with everyone who
stands to lose from conflict]{.underline}. [Land and water protectors,
feminists, antinuclear activists, those organising for demilitarisation,
equality, and care must lead the work for peace, not the people who
profit from conflict]{.underline}.

Abolition for transformation

We need a paradigm shift in international relations, stemming from this
kind of people-centred peace process. [We need to alter the relations
between U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and Russia, but more
broadly [we need to dismantle]{.mark} the militarised global order,
**[militarised conceptions of security]{.mark}**, and the dominance of
the military-industrial complex over world affairs]{.underline}. [The
hegemony of colonial-corporate extractivism must also be transformed ---
for the climate, for relations with First Nations, for the protection of
land, water, air, and animals]{.underline}.

[An **[abolitionist framing is useful for cultivating such
transformation]{.mark}**. Instead of investing in weapons and preparing
for war, we must be investing instead of care for people and planet.
Abolition is a tool to build a world that works for all, instead of just
a few]{.underline}. The abolition of war, globally, requires disarmament
and arms control, systems for demilitarisation and reduction of military
spending. But [[it]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[**requires building
structures** for]{.mark} peace, [**solidarity**,
**cooperation**]{.mark}, and nonviolence [to
flourish]{.mark}]{.underline}. It means replacing weapons with renewable
energy, war with diplomacy, capitalism with a redistributive feminist
political economy that is centered on equality, social justice, degrowth
and ecological sustainability.

Unlearning the necessity of violence is essential to exploring what
could be built in its place. This means turning on its head so much of
what we are taught about what's necessary for safety and security in our
world. [It means learning to reject violence as a solution to all
problems, interrogating and challenging systems of power that assert
they exist to protect while instead they persecute and
oppress]{.underline}.

## PERM

### AT: Perm

#### [Poststructural analysis]{.underline} is [mutually exclusive]{.underline} with [endorsement]{.underline} -- [refusing]{.underline} to offer a competing solution [now]{.underline} is key to [producing future advocacies]{.underline} capable of solving both the case and our links -- that's Bacchi -- makes any perm [severance]{.underline} -- a [voter]{.underline} for making offense impossible

Economy in the Department of Government, Brunel University London,

[[The **only way out**]{.underline}]{.mark} of such a dilemma, to escape
the fetish, [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[to **eschew the logic of
security altogether**]{.underline}]{.mark} - to reject it as so
ideologically loaded in favour of the state that any real political
thought other than the authoritarian and reactionary should be pressed
to give it up. That is clearly something that can not be achieved within
the limits of bourgeois thought and thus could never even begin to be
imagined by the security intellectual. [It is]{.underline} also
[something that the **constant iteration** of the refrain **\'this is an
insecure world\'** [and **reiteration** of one]{.mark} fear, anxiety and
[**insecurity** after another will]{.mark} also **[make it hard to
do]{.mark}**. But it is something that the critique of security suggests
we may have to consider if we want a political way out of the impasse of
security]{.underline}.

[This impasse exists because security has now become so all-encompassing
that it marginalises all else, most notably the constructive conflicts,
debates and discussions that animate political life]{.underline}. The
constant [**[prioritising]{.mark}** of a mythical [**security** as a
**political end**]{.mark} - as the political end **[constitutes a
rejection of politics]{.mark}** in any meaningful sense of the
term]{.underline}. [That is, [as a mode of action in which **differences
can be articulated**]{.mark}, in which the conflicts and struggles that
arise from such differences can be fought for [and]{.mark} negotiated,
in which **[people]{.mark} might [come to believe]{.mark} that [another
world is possible]{.mark}** - that they might **transform the world**
[and]{.mark} in turn **[be transformed]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**[Security politics]{.mark}** simply **[removes
this]{.mark}**]{.underline}; worse, it removes it while purportedly
addressing it. [In so doing it **suppresses all issues of power** [and
**turns political questions** into **debates** about the **most
efficient way to achieve \'security\'**]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite
the fact that we are never quite told - never could be told - what might
count as having achieved it. [Security politics is, in this sense, an
anti-politics]{.underline},141 [**dominating political discourse** in
much the same manner as the security state tries to dominate human
beings, reinforcing]{.underline} security fetishism and [[the
**monopolistic character of security on the political
imagination**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We]{.underline} therefore [need to
**get beyond** security politics, **not add** yet more \'sectors\' to it
in a way that [simply **expands the scope of**]{.mark}]{.underline} the
state [[and **legitimises**]{.mark} **state [intervention]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} yet more and **[more areas]{.mark}** of our
lives]{.underline}.

Simon Dalby reports a personal communication with Michael Williams,
co-editor of the important text Critical Security Studies, in which the
latter [asks: if you take away security, what do you put in the hole
that\'s left behind? But]{.underline} I\'m inclined to agree with Dalby:
maybe [there is no hole]{.underline}.142 [The mistake has been to think
that there is a hole and that this hole needs to be filled with a new
vision or revision of security in which it is re-mapped or civilised or
gendered or humanised or expanded or whatever]{.underline}. All of these
ultimately remain within the statist political imaginary, and
consequently end up reaffirming the state as the terrain of modern
politics, the grounds of security. [[The **real task** is]{.mark} not to
fill the supposed hole with yet another vision of security, but [to
fight for]{.mark} an **[alternative political language]{.mark}** which
takes us beyond the narrow horizon of bourgeois security]{.underline}
and which therefore does not constantly throw us into the arms of the
state. [That\'s the point of critical politics: to develop a **new
political language** more adequate to the kind of society we
want]{.underline}. Thus while much of what I have said here has been of
a negative order, [part of the tradition of critical theory is that [the
**negative**]{.mark} may be [**as significant as the positive** in
**setting thought on new paths**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

For [if **security** really is the]{.underline} supreme concept of
bourgeois society and the [fundamental thematic of **liberalism**, then
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} keep harping on about insecurity and to [[keep
demanding \'more security\']{.underline}]{.mark} (while meekly hoping
that this increased security doesn\'t damage our liberty) [[is
to]{.underline}]{.mark} blind ourselves to [\[[**remain ignorant**
of]{.mark}\] [the possibility of **building real alternatives**]{.mark}
to the authoritarian tendencies in contemporary politics]{.underline}.
[To **situate ourselves against security politics** would **allow us to
circumvent** the debilitating effect achieved through the constant
**securitising** of social and political issues, debilitating in the
sense that \'security\' helps consolidate the power of the existing
forms of social domination and justifies the short-circuiting of even
the most democratic forms. It would also **allow us to forge another
kind of politics** [centred on a **different conception of the
good**]{.mark}. We need a **new way of thinking and talking** about
social being and politics that moves us beyond security]{.underline}.
This would perhaps be emancipatory in the true sense of the word. What
this might mean, precisely, must be open to debate. But [it certainly
requires recognising that security is an illusion that has forgotten it
is an illusion; it requires recognising that [**security** is
**not**]{.mark} the same as **[solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}; it
requires accepting that insecurity is part of the human condition, and
thus giving up the search for the certainty of security and instead
learning to tolerate the uncertainties, ambiguities and \'insecurities\'
that come with being human; [it requires accepting that \'securitizing\'
an issue does not mean dealing with it politically, but bracketing it
out and handing it to the state; it requires us to be brave enough to
return the gift]{.underline}.143

### AT: Performative Contradiction

#### The fact that we also read positions that link is irrelevant -- our framework isn't "you said a dirty word" -- rather, that a win condition for poststructuralist criticism, within a hypothesis testing approach to policy analysis, is important to produce reflective subjects capable of transformative change -- it's NOT a contradiction and does NOT justify "severing reps"

**Jahn 21** Beate Jahn, Professor of International Relations at the
University of Sussex, President of the European International Studies
Association, "Critical theory in crisis? a reconsideration," European
Journal of International Relations, 27(4), 2021, DOI
10.1177/13540661211049491 /GoGreen!

But what does this mean for critical theory in practice---and for its
relationship to practice? After all, [critical theory cannot just rest
on these **metatheoretical principles**; it **has to apply
them**]{.underline}. [And this means, first of all, that in the absence
of a privileged vantage point with access to society as a
whole]{.underline} (Horkheimer, 1968: 29), [it must---just like
traditional theory---take particular]{.underline} individuals, groups,
or [issues as a starting point]{.underline}. [Second, in the absence of
special methods, critical analyses must also use the most advanced
theoretical tools available]{.underline}. [Third, however, in order not
to separate theory and practice, critical analysis has to focus
reflexively on the particular forms of knowledge that constitute its
object]{.underline}. [And, finally, it must explore how the problem at
hand is entangled with society as a whole]{.underline} (Horkheimer,
1968: 35, 30).

[[**In practice** there is]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [**[considerable
overlap]{.mark}** between conventional and critical
theory---[from]{.mark} the [**focus on particular problems** to]{.mark}
the [use of **common methods**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,
Horkheimer's analysis of the limitations of "traditional" theory were
not at all unique. Max Weber's lecture on Science as a Vocation famously
[highlights the **limits** of scientific **knowledge:** establishing its
**historical nature**, the **particularity** of its insights, its
**inability** to grasp the whole or to establish
**objectivity**]{.underline} (Weber, 1948: 137, 135, 138, 139, 153).
Weber (1948), too, comes to the conclusion that "science is meaningless
because it gives no answer to . . . the only question important for us:
'What shall we do and how shall we live?'" (p. 143). And like critical
theory, Weber (1948) sees the highest aim of science in exploring 'the
devil's ways to the end in order to realize his power and his
limitations' (p. 152). [Mainstream and critical theories thus share a
reflexive critique of science, just as they share conventional methods.
Hence, **[the fact that critical theorists themselves use positivist
methods]{.mark}**---work on the "authoritarian personality," for
example, [is based on **hypothesis testing**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Adorno, 1973)---[or that critical IR theorists use a wide range of
empirical methods]{.underline} (as we have seen in the previous section)
**[[does not present a contradiction]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[[Rather, the **difference**]{.mark} between conventional and critical
theory **[lies in the response]{.mark}** to these limitations of
science]{.underline}. For Weber, these limitations lead, at best, to
self-clarification about the implications of the ends or means we
choose, and thus to an ethic of responsibility (Weber, 1948: 152).
Meanwhile, [critical theorists [aim to **overcome**]{.mark} **these
[limitations]{.mark}**---[not by promising a substantive utopia but **by
keeping the possibility of an alternative open**: through]{.mark} the
[refusal to become "useful"]{.mark} within the given
parameters]{.underline}.

## IMPACT

### AT: Consequentialism

#### [Consequentialism]{.underline} is inseparable from [securitization]{.underline} -- relies upon treating [violence]{.underline} as a [knowable object]{.underline}, rather than an [intersubjective relation]{.underline} -- training students to [describe "causes"]{.underline}, rather than examine [their own relationship to its enabling structures]{.underline} -- ensures [external, Otherized]{.underline} threats are [inflated]{.underline}, while the [greater violence]{.underline} [endemic to securitized society]{.underline} is [dismissed]{.underline} because "the ALT doesn't solve" -- prioritize our impacts in distrust of your capacity to evaluate consequentialist debate on these terms

Cultural Diversity and Wellbeing at Victoria University, "The Return of
Violence," Chapter 1, *Our Violent World: Terrorism in Society*,
Palgrave Macmillan, 2013, ISBN 978-0-230-22473-5, pp.1-4 /GoGreen!

Among the most significant of these changes are transformations in forms
of social and political violence, the kinds of violence recently
described by the philosopher Charles Taylor as 'categorial', directed
towards people whom the protagonists do not personally know (2011).
Often such violence is contrasted to the violence that takes place
within personal relationships, but as we will see as this book develops,
this distinction is not as clear as it once may have been. The chapters
that follow attempt to explore a context that has become increasingly
evident, as violence that once appeared to be \'contained\' by key
dimensions of modern society is now much more fluid, increasingly part
of the flows making up a global world (Urry 2005). But such
[[**violence** is **not**]{.mark} a \'thing\' or [an **object**]{.mark}.
[It is a **form of agency**, an **embodied**]{.mark} relationship and
human **[experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As such, it is [a]{.mark}
**critical [lens]{.mark}** [through which to **explore**]{.mark} **wider
[transformations of social life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On the other
hand, [**[to separate violence]{.mark} from such transformations**
**profoundly [limits our capacity to understand, and respond]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark}, one of the most urgent questions shaping the twenty-first
century]{.underline}.\
The Surveillance Society\
[Most of us are aware of changing forms or potentials of violence
through [the growth of **security**]{.mark} and
**surveillance**]{.underline} (Crelinsten 2009). Some developments are
obvious, such as airport security. Others are less so, such as passport
tracking systems, internment camps, control orders and detention without
trial, or erosion of the distinction between immigration policy and
security policy (Connolly 2005: 54). Some receive extensive debate in
the press and social media, while other developments are less discussed.
Over recent years, for example, states as different as Iran, Saudi
Arabia, Israel and the United States have been engaged in the
construction of thousands of kilometres of walls along national borders,
a development that the political scientist Wendy Brown calls
\'walling\', something she contends is driven by \'waning sovereignty\'
(2010). **[[Global military expenditure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which
had declined in the years following the end of the Cold War in 1989,
[expanded rapidly]{.underline} over the first decade of the new century,
increasing by some 49 per cent to reach US\$1.53 trillion in 2009
(Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 2011). [New types of
public **[surveillance]{.mark}** involve pervasive but ambiguous
categories of \'pre-crime\' as public policy seeks to identify groups
[and]{.mark} individuals \'at risk\' of committing criminal
acts]{.underline} (Zedner 2007). The changing role of the criminal
justice system has become [evident in [the relentless increase
in]{.mark} the number of **[people imprisoned]{.mark}** in the
world]{.underline}, a figure that reached some 10.65 million in 2009
(Walmsley 2010).\
[Political theorists in particular have been aware of the ways these
transformations **\'resonate\', [mutually amplifying]{.mark}** each
other]{.underline} (Connolly 2005: 54). Brian Massumi (2007) argues that
[we are witnessing the emergence of a new type of governance in complex
societies, one shaped by a shift from a model of prevention, which
operates [in an **\'objectively knowable world\'**]{.mark}, to a model
of pre-emption, which involves the attempt to wield power in a world
based on uncertainty]{.underline}. [Brad Evans]{.underline} (2010)
[points to the rise [of '**consequentialist ethics**]{.mark}' involved
in this development, [where]{.mark} forms of **[moral
judgement]{.mark}** framed in terms [of **'right' and 'wrong'**
are]{.mark} becoming **[redefined as calculations]{.mark}** to determine
whether a situation is to be [judged **better or worse** as a result of
a **course of action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [These are **not minor
transformations**]{.underline}. The OECD argues that \'security\' has
become a major area of economic activity, a driver of modern economies
(OECD 2004), while the sociologist David Lyon traces the contours of a
surveillance society increasingly based on digital technologies (Lyon
2004). The political philosopher William Connolly argues that [this new
social and political model involves an **increasing mobilization of the
population against 'unspecified enemies'**]{.underline} (2005: 54).\
The Blurring of War and Peace\
One way to [think about this transformation]{.underline} is [in terms of
a changing relationship between peace and war]{.underline}. The
historical sociologist Charles Tilly argues that the emergence of modern
societies from the seventeenth century to the Second World War saw
violence moving in two directions: increasingly deadly inter-state
confrontations and increasingly peaceful domestic societies, evident in
the disarming of populations and the rise of peaceful forms of protest
and conflict (Tilly 2002, 2003). This constituted [an increasingly clear
separation between zones of war and zones of peace]{.underline}, a
separation that for the philosopher Immanuel Kant constituted the very
basis of modern society (Kleingold 2006: ix). [[This
account]{.underline}]{.mark} of the birth of modernity [[**locates
violence beyond the borders** of]{.mark} increasingly **[peaceful
societies]{.mark}**, and to a significant extent has established itself
as **[a structure of thought preventing]{.mark} any significant
[exploration of the violence at the heart of modern societies]{.mark}**,
in particular the violence present in colonial expansion, or in the
extent of atrocities and extreme violence undertaken by the colonizers
in the process of decolonization]{.underline} (Bennett 2011). Within
this modern self-understanding, [the **[capacity for extreme
violence]{.mark}** has [always]{.mark} been **[associated with \'the
Other']{.mark}**, with modern society, by definition, understood as
being inherently peaceful]{.underline}.\
[The **[securitization]{.mark}** we have referred to above
[signals]{.mark} two related transformations: the separation between war
and peace is becoming less and less clear, while the state\'s monopoly
of violence is becoming less and less certain]{.underline}. Rather than
war being an external event, the cultural geographer Nigel Thrift argues
that [contemporary, globalizing societies have entered [an '**era of
permanent and pervasive war**]{.mark}']{.underline} (2011: 11), [with
war no longer understood as taking place beyond borders, but **[across
all areas of social life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This shift seems
particularly evident when we look at urban design, where we encounter
not simply the increasing integration of blast proofing and other
defensive systems into buildings, but the actual militarization of urban
space, evident in particular in contemporary military theory where older
conceptions of \'battlefield\' are giving way to new models of \'battle
space\' (see Graham 2012) where [the **space of warfare** becomes
'**coterminus with the space of civil society** itself']{.underline}
(Dillon and Reid 2009: 128). This pattern is evident in the extent that
[conceptions of urban security developed in a warzone]{.underline} such
as post-2003 Baghdad [have established themselves as paradigms for
policing and security in the cities of North America and
Europe]{.underline} (Graham 2010).\
[**[War]{.mark}**, from this perspective, rather than being an activity
beyond the borders of modern society, **[becomes instead a lens with
which to conceive of the core organization of such
societies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The rise of war as a lens to frame
social life has been particularly evident in military theory. William
Lind, for example, argues that the world has entered an age of \'fourth
generation war\', characterized by the loss of the state\'s monopoly
over the exercise of war. [Today states find themselves at war with
non-state opponents]{.underline}, wars he argues that states are losing.
Writing in a respected journal, Lind argues \'invasion by immigration
can be at least as dangerous as invasion by a state army\' (2004: 14).
We do not need to embrace this type of argument to recognize that the
twenty-first century has been shaped by an awareness of a new
vulnerability.

should **[possess great leverage in explaining]{.mark}** the **[lack of

political community should **[subsume the liberal peace
literature]{.mark}** and account for its findings]{.underline}. [We
**[test]{.mark} our theory** by examining whether political community
reduces militarized conflicts in dyads from 1816-2001]{.underline}. We
also examine how political community increases state preferences and
voting at the UN. We create our measure of political community by
measuring the similarity of two states' portfolios of memberships in
IGOs, focusing more specifically on economic and security organizations,
with the use of the S-score methodology by Signorino and Ritter (1999).
By using the S-score instead of summing IGOs we tap into the spatial
aspects of political community that condition the interactions of dyads.
[Our **[findings support our theory]{.mark}**. When we include our

though, while we show that political community also explains national
preferences and affinities, measured using Gartzke's data (1998),
Affinity still has an independent pacifying effect separate from both
political community and liberalism, which begs the question what
Gartzke's measure is actually measuring.

Toward a Phenomenology of Violence

To illustrate the limits of direct and indirect accounts of violence,
consider the following thought experiment. A man enters a home with a
gun, points the gun at the family, and begins to make requests of the
family. The family, intimidated by the implied threat of the gun,
complies. Is this interaction violent? Most people would agree that,
yes, it is. The implied threat of force terrorizes the family. Yet,
neither direct nor indirect conceptions of violence adequately capture
the violence of this scene. Any physical violence committed by the
gunman is direct violence, and any causal, lasting, yet largely unseen
effects (such as a heart attack induced later by the stress of attack)
is indirect violence. While direct and indirect violence both focus on
measured effects of violence, our point is more fundamental. We offer a
third conception of violence to make sense of such scenes.

[Acts of violence do not only inflict physical (and/or psychological)
harm, they also restructure the social and political world]{.underline}.
Imagine that the gunman in the thought experiment attacked a white South
African family who live within a gated complex. The barbed wire crowning
the compound walls, the bars on all the doors and windows, and the
private security guard posted out front illustrate how this family lives
in constant fear of armed intruders. The assailant might come from a
family that suffered under apartheid\'s racialized social order. He
might not have benefited from society\'s democratization and
liberalization. If the gunman scaled these walls and inflicted
wounds---physical or otherwise---everyone would agree violence had
occurred. But what if the barbed wire, barred windows, and private
security guard successfully kept the would-be assailant at bay? The
family goes about its daily routine, but is the world any less violent?
Though the presence of walls and barbed wire prevent observable violence
in this scenario, we argue that this society remains---in its lived,
material, and psychic forms---structured by violence. [Violence
constitutes the worldhood]{.underline}.

[[Data showing]{.mark} that direct violence is on the [decline
obscures]{.mark} the [**intensification** of other forms]{.mark} of
violence]{.underline}. Using the graph below as an example, [rapid and
historically unprecedented increases in economic inequality]{.underline}
since 1970 [have coincided with the pacification of militant political
opposition such as rioting, guerrilla warfare, and political
assassinations]{.underline} (see Figure 1).9 Rioting, guerrilla warfare,
and assassinations throughout the first half of the twentieth century
exposed increasing discontent with perceived systemic injustice,
including capitalism, patriarchy, imperialism, colonialism, and white
supremacy. [Liberal society suppressed these forms of violent political
resistance]{.underline} over the past fifty years (Murphy 2017). [A
restructuring of social relations displaced and co-opted violent
protests against the perceived injustices of the world order. This
restructuring represents a]{.underline} third [type of violence called
pacification]{.underline}.10

\[Figure 1 Omitted\]

[[The hallmark of pacification is that]{.mark} the structures of
domination ensure that resistance in the form of direct violence against
this order is less frequent. There are numerous ways that **implicit and
explicit [threats]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} **global [surveillance]{.mark}**[,
**imbalances in military power**, **displays of military might**,
**occupations**, **blockades**, **nuclear deterrence**,
**terrorism**,]{.mark} and **[c]{.mark}**ounter**[t]{.mark}**errorism,
[**counterinsurgency**, **sanctions**, **trade disputes**, and
**embargoes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [**[restructure
intersubjective relationships]{.mark}** in global politics. A focus
solely on discrete acts of physical harm and quantifiable events does
not and cannot capture the restructuring consequences of these acts. Our
account of violence hypothesizes that the restructuring of social and
political worlds might lead to fewer acts of direct violence if the
restructuring deters agents from engaging in direct violence. The
restructuring might also lead to less quantifiable physical harm, direct
or indirect. However, this decrease may be achieved **through an
intensification of pacification**]{.underline}.

Our point is that [pacification is the most difficult kind of violence
to observe and, if operating effectively, will correlate with the
absence of direct violence. Pacification is difficult to observe because
it is diffuse and involves the coercive reordering of social relations.
Phenomenology, with its focus on background practices, structures, and
the constitution of social relations, provides a methodology for
uncovering this form of violence]{.underline}.

The first step in this theoretical development is to recognize the
intersubjective character of violence. The meaningful structures of our
world do not exist independently of us. [Our identities are in a
coconstitutive relationship with our society\'s institutions, practices,
shared meanings, and norms]{.underline} (Taylor 1971, 27). [A
phenomenological account of violence examines the ways that violence is
not simply a thing. "The expression 'phenomenology' signifies primarily
a methodological conception," able to uncover not just things
themselves, but phenomena that are hidden yet are fundamental to our
being]{.underline} (Heidegger 1962, 59). These phenomena include
different types of beings or entities, including structures, and how our
being makes sense of and functions in this world (Dreyfus 1991, 32).

[Violence is one of the structures of our world and contributes to our
understanding and ability to function in this world. There
are]{.underline}, however, [different worlds]{.underline} (Heidegger
1962, 93). Martin Heidegger offers a tripartite classification. [The
first]{.underline} (1) [is the world of physical objects. The
second]{.underline} (2) [is a world of shared practices and shared
beliefs. The third]{.underline} (3), what Heidegger calls
"[worldhood]{.underline}," [is the ontological-existential sense of the
world]{.underline} (1962, 93). [Direct violence operates in the first
world. Indirect violence operates in the second world. Pacification as
violence exists in this third world]{.underline}
([worldhood]{.underline}).

[Within world three the ontological character of violence
is]{.underline} not that of an object, but is [the structuring of the
intersubjective relations of our being-in-the-world]{.underline}. Most
of the time we are able to function in our surroundings because of our
ability to cope with that which we encounter. We know how to act in
certain situations and what specific purpose specific things serve.
Sometimes, however, something breaks down or malfunctions. In such
situations, the object, relation, or worldhood reveals itself (Heidegger
1962, 105). This revealing is when the inconspicuous becomes
conspicuous. Violence functions as a moment of revealing.11 Overt acts
of violence (direct or indirect) reveal elements of our world that
otherwise remain hidden. Violence brings out grievances and animosities
that are otherwise dormant, perhaps simmering, waiting to be released;
this is the case whether it is to do violence to a text or to erupt
physical violence in a pub. Similarly, the violence of a riot is a
visible expression of a worldhood characterized by unseen or ignored
social relations.

[Our typology of violence distinguishes between direct, indirect, and
pacification]{.underline} (see Figure 2). The typology distinguishes six
different characteristics across the three types of violence.
Pacification operates through different modes of power other than direct
and indirect violence. Drawing on Michael Barnett\'s and Raymond Duvall
(2005, 48) typology of power, direct violence corresponds to compulsory
power, indirect violence to institutional and structural power, and
pacification to productive power and some elements of structural power.
Pacification as violence is inconspicuous. It pertains to our worldhood
in a constitutive fashion. It is intersubjective and it is diffuse.
These characteristics, taken together, identify pacification in
ontological-existential terms.

\[Figure 2 Omitted\]

[Researchers rarely]{.underline}, if ever, [consider violence that falls
under the ontological-existential category]{.underline}. From this
category, what counts as violence within international relations
scholarship is be understood instead as brief moments when the largely
invisible structuring of the world becomes visible: direct violence is
epiphenomenal. To rephrase Heidegger, direct and indirect violence mark
breakdowns that reveal part of the world, but violence remains a part of
this world that it reveals.

Phenomenology, as we are using it, is not about lived experience. It is
the philosophical tradition of revealing different types of beings and
things that contain meaning in our world, the structures and/or contexts
in which they exist, and how these structures and contexts are
meaningful. Understood in this way, violence is one of these structures
and/or contexts. A phenomenological perspective does not approach
violence from a particular normative position, although it does not
preclude normative critique. [A phenomenological approach does not treat
violence as a discrete thing that one agent does to another, although it
does not preclude such acts being described as violent. Instead, [a
phenomenological perspective adds to our]{.mark} intellectual and
methodological [toolbox by identifying]{.mark} violence [as **a
condition or context in which people function**]{.mark}. Phenomenology
allows us to identify violence occurring in ways and in places that we
otherwise would not be able to recognize]{.underline}. It does not
change the meaning of violence (as harm, for example). Instead, [it
treats violence **ontologically**, enabling us to reveal more accurately
the extent to which violence exists in the world]{.underline}.

[From a phenomenological perspective, violence is often inconspicuous.
Violence can function as a naturalized or internalized regime of
compulsion or domination. Pacification reveals both the pervasiveness of
violence and forms of violence that may otherwise remain
inconspicuous]{.underline}. The erasing of tradition and the enforcement
of particular legal codes at the expense of indigenous cultural norms is
one example of an inconspicuous form of violence that involves
conspicuous and inconspicous consequences (Cocks 2014). [[In
understanding]{.mark} violence [phenomenologically]{.mark}, as a
structure of revealing across multiple worlds, [we]{.mark} are better
able to [reveal **the extent to which violence shapes our world** and
how we are]{.mark} then **[shaped by violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Pacavere

The Romans understood violence as a necessary condition for pax. [The
liberal imagination blinds itself to the ways that pacification
functions as violence in our world order. I]{.underline}nternational
[r]{.underline}elations [scholarship\'s strict distinction between peace
and violence reinforces this obfuscation. Yet, [the violence of (and in)
pacification is central]{.mark} to the contemporary world]{.underline}.
A phenomenological approach shows that moments of violent rupture are
not aberrations of the world order. Violent outbreaks are breakdowns of
pacification. It follows that [[multiple structures]{.mark} of the world
order [function as]{.mark} the [violence]{.mark} of
pacification]{.underline}, of pacavere.12 [[These]{.mark} structures
[include **liberal capitalism**, **colonialism**]{.mark} and the
postcolonial aftermath, [and **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Each
functions as a key site of pacification. Anarchist thought reveals the
pacification in liberal capitalism. Postcolonial thought reveals the
pacification of colonial projects. Both anarchist and postcolonial
thought demonstrate how war is a breakdown of pacification, revealing
the hidden violent structures of our worldhood.

Anarchist critiques of capitalism, unlike Marxist and liberal
interpretations, take seriously the decisive role of state violence in
structuring society and markets. Anarchists view the state as an
institution that sustains elite appropriations of political and economic
power (Proudhon \[1861\] 1998; Sorel 1999; Prichard 2015). Those at the
bottom of the social hierarchy bear the costs of this enforced order.
The state diffuses violence (pacification) throughout the entire
society---often in ways that go unrecognized by its subjects (Sorel
1999, 65). The naturalization of violence consolidates arbitrary regimes
of domination in society. [While specific, countable incidents of
violence may decline, the social order is largely premised on the threat
of violence for contravening social norms making specific, countable
incidents of violence relatively rare]{.underline} (Kinna and Prichard,
forthcoming).

Anarchist thinkers view rising inequality in the context of declining
riots, insurgencies, and assassinations (see Figure 1) as evidence of
pacification. Incidents of proletarian violence, anticolonial violence,
riots, and protests are all examples of resistance to the "regimes of
domination" that shape contemporary society, regimes easily identifiable
by those subject to them (Gordon 2007, 33). Drawing on these accounts,
we interpret declining rates of riots as a sign of increased
pacification, rather than evidence that the system is becoming less
violent. Conversely, eruptions of antistate and anticapitalist direct
violence are signs of a breakdown in pacification. Much like
Heidegger\'s example of broken equipment (1962, 102--3, 412--13), which
draws our attention to the background structures of our world, brief
instances of direct violence reveal violently structured social
relations.

[Although the liberal imagination obscures the centrality of violence,
violence has always been central to the liberal world
order]{.underline}---to the liberal worldhood---particularly during the
colonial and imperial projects of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries
(Bell 2007a, 2007b). Colonial violence was diffused throughout the
entire society, often in ways that went unrecognized by the colonized
themselves. The violence of pacification structured the very existence
of the colonized subject. This violence transformed the colonized
subjects into a different "species" (Fanon 1963, 35--40, 43). Colonial
pacification was more than direct and indirect violence; it was
sufficiently diffuse to remake the psyche of the colonized, affecting
their mental health and emotions (Fanon 1963, 35--106). Fanon (1963, 31)
described it as "atmospheric violence," a "violence rippling under the
skin." Unable to lash out against the colonizer, the colonized lived
everyday within a world ordered by violence. In this world, the
colonized could not respond to the colonizers for fear of directly
violent reprisals and would turn to symbolic activities such as a dance
circle to expose the violence experienced on a daily basis (Fanon 1963,
57). For the colonized, rituals such as the dance were a means of
expressing existential frustrations with and resistance to the violence
of colonial pacification through reenactments of direct violence.
Ultimately, anticolonial struggles exposed the violence of colonialism
by directing that violence back on its authors.

Practices of colonial rule were central to developing liberal norms of
sovereignty, as well as to the domination and control of recalcitrant
populations whether within Europe, such as the English domination of the
Welsh, Irish, and Scots, or outside of Europe by settler colonialists
against indigenous populations (Deloria Jr 1974; Anghie 2005; Miller
2006; Havercroft 2008; Shaw 2008; Barkawi and Stanski 2012; Coulthard
2014; Simpson 2014; Lightfoot 2016; Rueda-Saiz 2017). This civilizing
imagination functioned phenomenologically. It produced insiders as
civilized and peaceful and outsiders as violent, external threats to
civilization. In doing so, this imagination successfully obscured how
the structures of liberalism produced colonial violence.13

The idea of war as an external practice of states, not tied to their
internal workings and located according to specific normative
projections of Western identity, followed from this colonial mentality.
This mentality legitimized the exporting of violence to create a Western
imperial pax and was so widespread that it shaped the development of
modern warfare (Ellis 1986; Proudhon \[1861\] 1998). The colonial wars
reproduced and reinforced ideologies of Western superiority, evidenced
in part by the West\'s superior military technology. A consequence of
this racist hubris was the inability to foresee the destructive
tendencies of Western warfare when unleashed against themselves (Ellis
1986).

The discipline of international relations, founded in response to the
unexpectedly destructive character of the First World War, reproduced
this understanding of war.14 This understanding disguises the
possibility of increasing violence within the liberal world by presuming
a historical narrative of progress and being shocked by its aberration.
[[War]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[is]{.mark} not the absence of
peace or an aberration of liberal progress, but is instead **[a
phenomenological breaking of the liberal
worldhood]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15

[Once a liberal order of democracy, free markets, and international
institutions are spread throughout the world, liberal ideology imagines
peace as the end state. Yet, states often deploy war under liberal
guises]{.underline}.16 [Wars under the aegis of humanitarian values and
regime change are examples of the multifaceted character of liberal
pacification. Liberal regimes emphasize the violence of those that they
are invading, while minimizing the violence involved in these military
undertakings and the violence necessary to sustain the liberal societies
themselves]{.underline}. What Pierre-Joseph Proudhon called "the moral
phenomenology of war" (Prichard 2015, 112--34; Proudhon \[1861\] 1998)
becomes an integral part of the everyday workings of society that shape
innumerable aspects of our daily language. The upshot is that, within
liberal ideology, the violence committed by liberal states is justified,
whereas the violence committed by illiberal states is not.

Postcolonial and anarchist scholarship focuses on the incorporation of
violence in the production of liberal spaces (Barkawi and Laffey 1999).
These same concerns can be directed onto the liberal order itself. Seen
from the perspective of marginalized and oppressed populations, the
structures of liberal pacification take on a distinctly violent aspect.
[The liberal world is not less violent. Rather, [the liberal world
involves a]{.mark} sophisticated [phenomenological process of
legitimating certain]{.mark} types of [violence **in order to render
other types**]{.mark} **of violence [invisible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Liberal Pacification

What does it mean to apply this third type of violence to our
understanding of international relations? [Pacification reveals
liberalism as a violent process as opposed to a system that is
emblematic of the absence of direct violence]{.underline}. There are
parallels between the Pax Britannia, Pax Americana, and the ancient
peace of the Pax Romana (Neocleous 2010, 13). However, our account
emphasizes the crucial role of pacification as a distinct kind of
violence in maintaining these pacific orders. Our theory offers the
novel insight that incorporating pacification into the analysis of the
liberal peace reveals crucial aspects of this peace that conventional
and critical accounts neglect.

A focus on pacification provides three critical insights. First, it
recovers the crucial role of pacification in the historical founding of
the liberal order. Second, by distinguishing between three kinds of
violence (Figure 2), we account for the empirical observations of the
liberal peace as leading to a decline in direct violence and an increase
in violence overall as part of the pacification of the Pax Americana.
Conversely, the liberal version of the Pax Americana cannot account for
key anomalies. Third, our approach draws attention to the violent
ordering of social relations. This dimension of violence is neglected
even in Marxist, postcolonial, neo-Gramscian, and post-structuralist
critiques of the liberal peace, which primarily focus on the role of
direct and indirect violence in maintaining the Pax Americana.

[Contemporary liberal i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
[theory emphasizes the nonviolent role of the liberal triad]{.underline}
(democracy, free markets, and institutions) [in causing the liberal
peace]{.underline}. Yet, a quick review of the history of liberalism in
the nineteenth and twentieth centuries shows that key figures in
liberalism, from John Stuart Mill, to Joseph Galliéni, to American
foreign policy elites, understood pacification as a necessary step in
establishing and maintaining the liberal order.

Mill, one of the philosophical founders of liberalism, conceptualized
and deployed liberalism as a domination strategy. Mill argued that it is
appropriate to impose despotism or slavery on "savages" who incline to
"fighting and rapine," but the government should use force as little as
possible:

> What they require is not a government of force, but one of guidance.
> Being, however, in too low a state to yield to the guidance of any but
> those to whom they look up as the possessors of force, the sort of
> government fittest for them is one \[that\] possesses force, but
> seldom uses it. (Mill 1998, 232--33)

In terms of our conceptual distinction, Mill argued that liberalism as
pacification was a more effective instrument of violence than the direct
modes of violence that governments usually deploy.

The history of European colonialism is replete with this line of
reasoning. "\[L\]iberal improvement" was a regular plank of colonial
strategy by France and Britain in the nineteenth century (Owens 2015,
154). Consider one example from the French colonial tradition. Galliéni,
a military commander and administrator, consciously deployed liberalism
as a domination strategy in the pacification of Tonkin during the 1890s.
Galliéni\'s strategy involved slowly spreading military outposts and
deploying civil administrators to create markets, schools, and
amenities. The rationale was that locals would gain a personal interest
in the continuation of French control and would help to quell Chinese
brigandage. "Piracy," said Galliéni, "is the result of an economic
condition. It can be fought by prosperity" (quoted in Owens 2015, 157).
Galliéni devised a "theory of pacification" in which "the correct
combination of force and politics can socialize, pacify, and domesticate
a population into regulating itself" (quoted in Owens 2015, 157). What
Mill proposed in theory, Galliéni enacted in practice;
pacification---the violent reordering of social relations in a
colony---was a more effective means of maintaining liberal rule than the
deployment of direct violence.

While less explicit, the relationship between liberalism and imperialism
remained present in the twentieth-century development of the Pax
Americana. During this era, US policy makers sought to construct a zone
of peace distinct from the zones of war associated with authoritarian
regimes. The US State Department first recognized the concept of
"hegemonic pacification" in the Euro-Atlantic conference diplomacy of
the 1920s (Cohrs 2008, 619). The United States' "strategic restraint" in
the aftermath of World War Two was motivated by this concept of liberal,
hegemonic pacification (Ikenberry 2009; Ikenberry 2011, 173). US defense
officials Stimson, Patterson, McCloy, and Assistant Secretary Howard C.
Peterson agreed that it was a matter of the security interests of the
United States to maintain "open markets, unhindered access to raw
materials, and the rehabilitation of much---if not all---of Eurasia
along liberal capitalist lines" (Leffler 1984, 349--56; Barkawi and
Laffey 1999). Liberalism as a domination and pacifying strategy
continued throughout (and long after) the Cold War (Laffey 2003; Stokes
2003), as evident in one of the founding documents of the post--World
War Two liberal order, NSC-68 (Ikenberry 2011, 168). [While the
enforcement of a Pax Americana eventually yielded a decline in direct
violence, it produced an increase in other types of
violence]{.underline}. The first insight of our theory is that
[pacification has always been part of the liberal project
and]{.underline} that [the violence in the liberal project never went
away]{.underline}.

The second insight is that [by reinterpreting the liberal peace as
liberal pacification we are able to grant the empirical findings of
liberal peace theorists while maintaining that the Pax Americana
represents an intensification of violence overall]{.underline}. In the
language of positivist social science, our theory is observationally
equivalent to that of liberal peace theory. We expect that the quantity
of direct violence inversely associates with the degree of pacification
in a society. Therefore, [our interpretation challenges research that
identifies liberal institutions as the cause of declining violence.
Liberal institutions, as apparatuses of liberal pacification, ensure
that direct violence is increasingly rare while leaving the structures
of violence and domination in place]{.underline}. The observational
equivalence on particular dependent variables (in our case, all forms of
direct violence) produces a theoretical change requiring the generation
of novel observable implications (King, Keohane, and Verba 1994, 30).

Furthermore, [increased suffering in liberal societies provides evidence
contradicting the main claims of liberal peace theories, while remaining
consistent with liberal pacification]{.underline}. At its core,
liberalism is a project that tries to maximize the utility of its
subjects (in other words, minimize suffering while maximizing
happiness). As such, [a state of liberal peace should lead to a decrease
in markers of suffering. However, there is more slavery in the world
today than ever before, with conservative estimates of]{.underline}
between 12.3 and [27 million people in debt bondage, chattel, or
contract slavery]{.underline} (Gordon 2012).17 Moreover, [there is ample
evidence of rising psychological disorders in liberal societies. A
preponderance of evidence from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [suggests that depression, anxiety, alienation,
opioid dependency, stress, other related psychological disorders,
increased social isolation, and the decline of community have increased
throughout the twentieth century]{.underline} (Twenge, Zhang, and Im
2004, 320; Adler, Boyce, Chesney, et al. 1994; Twenge 2000; Twenge,
Konrath, Foster, et al. 2008; Twenge, Gentile, DeWall, et al. 2010;
Cohen and Janicki-Deverts 2012; American Society of Addiction Medicine
2016). [Changes to human life associated with modernity have caused
psychological stress to increase]{.underline} (Jackson 2014). Mortality
rates have increased for some white, non-Hispanics aged 45--54 in the
United States between 1999 and 2013 (Case and Deaton 2015). Modern
technological advances from television to the Internet may contribute to
increasing separation and alienation of the social human animal into
individualized bodies connected by increasingly weak and empty bonds
(Putnam 2000; Gray 2011; Turkle 2011). At minimum, new information
communication technology such as Facebook can increase the stress and
anxiety of its users (Lee-Won, Herzog, and Park 2015). [The violent
structuring of liberalism enables increases in [social alienation,
anxiety, stress, and]{.mark} human [bondage through repression, economic
control, and social isolation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[These are not isolated instances of suffering. They [are **fundamental
structural features**]{.mark} **of our liberal world**. If liberalism is
a process of pacification rather than simply peace, then this rise in
individual suffering in liberal spaces may be evidence of a similar
process that Fanon equated with the psychic life of the colonist. Just
as Fanon\'s colonial subjects, unable to lash out at the settler through
direct violence, internalized their suffering, [modern liberal
subjects]{.mark}, [unable to resist]{.mark} liberal [pacification,
**internalize their suffering**]{.mark}]{.underline} (1982, chap. 6; cf.
Sorel 1999, 118). [Liberal peace should bring about a rise in happiness;
that it has **instead led to rising suffering** is evidence of liberal
pacification]{.underline}.

Third, in addition to offering an alternative interpretation of the
liberal peace, [our theory]{.underline} of liberal pacification
[supplements key insights from critical approaches to
peace]{.underline}. Tarak [Barkawi and]{.underline} Mark [Laffey\'s work
on imperial processes and liberal spaces]{.underline} makes a similar
point to ours, that the celebrated zone of liberal peace rests on
practices of violence (Barkawi and Laffey 1999, 2002; cf. Neocleous et
al. 2013). Their account, however, [focuses on practices of direct
violence, such as humanitarian interventions against authoritarian
regimes or corporations hiring local militias to make work sites in the
global south safe for economic extraction]{.underline} (Barkawi and
Laffey 1999, 422). Our point is that [these moments of direct violence
lead to pacification wherein social relations have been so violently
reordered as to make direct violence no longer necessary. Once direct
violence has established liberal space, pacification functions as a
structure of violence that sustains the space. Direct violence only
manifests itself when pacification weakens]{.underline}.

Pacification, however, does not merely operate through manipulating the
conscience of its subjects. While Marxist and Gramscian concepts of
ideology and hegemony are consistent with our theory of pacification
(Peceny 1997, 418), they do not address how the constructed political
order sustains itself through a violent reordering of social relations.
A Gramscian-inspired critique of the democratic peace can yield a
bird\'s-eye view of the ways in which liberal peace theory is itself
deployed as an ideological tool (Ish-Shalom 2006, 569--75). However,
Gramscian-inspired approaches do not account for the ways that everyday
practices of violence (for example, surveillance technologies, implied
threats from weapons, security barriers, etc.) sustain liberal
pacification. While ideational factors are important in pacification,
these factors rest upon practices and structures that are of an
ontological-existential character.

To review, our reinterpretation of the liberal peace as liberal
pacification offers three novel insights. First, [liberal
scholars]{.underline} and others [associate the development of the
liberal order with peace and a decline in violence by ignoring how
pacification is part of the liberal project]{.underline}. Second, [the
empirically observed decline in violence equated with the liberal peace
is not necessarily a sign of human progress but could be a sign of
intensified repression or increases in other forms of suffering across
the liberal world order]{.underline}. Third, [our concept of
[pacification reveals violence]{.mark} that is neither direct nor
indirect but is **[phenomenologically structured into the]{.mark} world
[order]{.mark}**. Understanding liberalism as pacification produces **a
paradigm shift**. Liberal pacification is **violent** in the sense that
**it coerces a specific type of liberal docility**, while also
preventing types of resistance that might be understood as violent,
including **riots**, **insurrections**, **civil wars**, and **interstate
wars**. Pacification reveals **the ongoing violence** at the heart of a
political project that imagines itself to be against
violence]{.underline}.

Conclusion

Our account of pacification recovers a crucial aspect of pax, one
originally etched into Roman monuments. The heading of the Res Gestae
(the funeral monument to Emperor Augustus) reads, "\[t\]his is how he
\[Augustus\] made the world subject to the power of the people of Rome"
(Beard 2016, 364). This monument does not celebrate peace as the absence
of violence; it celebrates pacification. Pax takes the form of a process
that violently reorders the world so that imperial subjects are rendered
incapable of using violence to resist Roman rule. [The absence of overt
acts of violence depends upon the maximization of
pacification]{.underline}.

[The practice of [pacification]{.mark} includes threats, coercion,
intimidation, and surveillance to restructure and sustain social and
political relations. When this type of violence operates effectively, it
appears as the absence of violence; pacification\'s violence resides in
the structuring of the prevailing order. While such an outcome may
appear peaceful, it entails, at best, a negative peace that [operates
through a **violent and coercive** reordering]{.mark} of
society]{.underline}.

[Liberal peace advocates measure direct violence and equate the decline
in that kind of violence with peace. However,]{.underline} our claim is
that [the spread of liberal institutions does not necessarily
**decrease** violence but **transforms** it. [Our]{.mark}
phenomenological [analysis captures empirical trends]{.mark} in human
domination and suffering that liberal peace theories fail to account
for, [including increased **inequality**, **slavery**, **anxiety**,
**addiction**, and **anomie**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Our analysis also
highlights how [[a decline in **direct** violence may]{.mark} actually
coincide with the [transform]{.mark}ation of [violence in ways that are
**concealed**, **monopolized**, and **structured into the
fabric**]{.mark} of modern liberal society]{.underline}. If our theory
is correct, we will find increases in markers of suffering as society
liberalizes. While we cannot say whether these indicators are unique to
pacified liberal societies, it is significant that they are rarely, if
ever, discussed in terms of violence and the liberal peace.

[[Liberal pacification **is**]{.mark} observationally equivalent to
[liberal peace]{.mark}. This is not a semantic argument. Liberal peace
advocates claim that processes that promote individual freedom and
autonomy]{.underline} (that is, democracy, free markets, and global
institutions) [cause peace. While]{.underline} the restructuring of the
global order---[pacification]{.underline}---[reduces direct violence, it
also restructures social relations in ways that **are** violent.
[Declines]{.mark} in directly observable violence [render other
forms]{.mark} of violence [**invisible as violence**;]{.mark} in
fact,]{.underline} [[**insidious**, **coercive**, and **violent**
systems of **military deterrence and compellence**, **nuclear terror**,
**surveillance**, and **intimidation** constitute **the worldhood of the
liberal order**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

10 Our account of pacification differs from those of Neocleous (2010,
2011) and Neocleous et al. (2013). We push beyond an account of violence
and peace as material or institutional forms of violence and toward an
account of violence that encompasses a richer phenomenology. In their
account, pacification operates through direct and indirect violence. In
our account pacification is a third kind of violence that makes
instances of the first two kinds of violence less likely.

11 While Heidegger\'s phenomenology in Being and Time does not address
either politics or violence, Hannah Arendt\'s (1970) work illuminates
the political implications of a phenomenological critique of violence.
In her critique, violence takes on similar characteristics as any other
technology that breaks. However, the type of breakdown that occurs
through violence differs from Heidegger\'s because violence involves
people\'s interactions with each other (and not primarily with other
objects). Arendt\'s treatment of violence rests on this distinction.

12 Pacavere is a conjugation of paco.

13 Arguments about the foundational role of colonialism, primitive
accumulation, and white supremacy in structuring the modern
international system are particularly useful in thinking about
phenomenological violence (Jones 2006; Anievas, Manchanda, and Shilliam
2015; Du Bois 1915; Shaw 2008; Coulthard 2014; Deloria 1974; Lowe 2015;
Hartman 1997). The legacy of these practices pervades contemporary
liberal peace-building (Richmond 2014; Sabaratnam 2015; Bouka 2013;
Autesserre 2009) and liberal global governance (Koomen 2014a, 2014b,
2013), while trade liberalization can facilitate mass violence (Kamola
2007; Smith 2016). Césaire argues that colonialism produced a "boomerang
effect" within European societies; Nazism was the return of violence
previously "applied only to non-European peoples" (Césaire 2000, 36). At
independence, international law became a mechanism for reinforcing this
international order upon the previously colonized world (Grovogui 1996).

14 See Agathangelou and Ling (2004), Vitalis (2017), Nayak and Selbin
(2013), and Koomen (2018). On different origin stories of international
relations and their consequences, see Baron (2014, 226--28).

15 Our concept of liberal pacification is not the same as "positive
peace." Paul Diehl argues that rather than focusing on the negative
peace---such as, "the absence of war"---scholars should also study
"broader conceptions of peace," namely those that include
"considerations of justice, human rights, and other aspects of human
security" (Diehl 2016, 9; Goertz, Diehl, and Balas 2016). Using the
terms of our analysis, however, such arguments simply call upon scholars
accustomed to studying peace as an absence of direct violence to expand
their analyses to study how liberal institutions can find solutions to
indirect violence as well. Phenomenological violence remains absent in
these accounts.

16 See Abu-Lughod (2015), Coker (1998, 2010, 2007), Dillon and Reid
(2009), Evans (2011), Howard (2008), and Neocleous (2010, 2013, 2011).

17 Much of the research we cite here is based on data from the United
States, mirroring the US-centric liberal peace literature. As a
paradigmatic liberal market economy, the United States should be a
most-likely case for the expectation of generally decreasing violence.
John Owen, for example, argues that it is not coincidental that the
"discourse and practice" of the democratic peace thesis was developed in
the United States, given that American social scientists are greatly
informed by the country\'s "strong liberal tradition" (2011, 162). For
an overview of the Eurocentric assumptions embedded within critiques of
the liberal peace, see Sabaratnam (2013). Anomalous observations from
the United States should raise doubts about other countries around the
world. There is evidence that such trends likely generalize across
liberal societies. For example, Ferrari, Charlson, Norman, et al. (2013)
have calculated that depression is a significant and growing cause of
shortened lifespans and death around the world, including within many
liberal societies. With respect to the pacification of violence, we note
that rioting has decreased as a share of street-protest activity
(relative to peaceful demonstrations) since the 1970s in most continents
around the world (Murphy 2017). These data suggest that these dynamics
are unlikely to be peculiar to the United States.

#### Liberal peace is the [chief motor]{.underline} behind global violence at [every scale]{.underline}---the impact is [mass death]{.underline} and [extinction]{.underline} from [far-right populism]{.underline} and [environmental collapse]{.underline}---[all stats go neg]{.underline} and [we control uniqueness]{.underline} because lib-ism [inevitably]{.underline} produces illiberal responses that their scholarship [can never account for]{.underline}

University (Ruben, "The liberal peace fallacy: violent neoliberalism and
the temporal and spatial traps of state-based approaches to peace,"
Territory, Politics, Governance, December 6, 2018, dml)
\[IRT=international relations theory\]

To develop this critique, I draw upon three main bodies of literature
that, despite their apparent affinities, are seldom brought together.
These include Polanyi and Gramsci-inspired understandings of hegemonic
crisis, counter-movements, and the rise of nationalism and populism
(Gill, 2015; Gonzalez-Vicente & Carroll, 2017); critical political
economies of social conflict within a context of neoliberal
globalization (Harvey, 2005; Springer, 2015); and political geography
analyses of international relations theory (IRT), and more specifically
critical geographies of peace (Agnew & Corbridge, 1995; Flint, 2005;
Koopman, 2016; McConnell, Megoran, & Williams, 2014; Megoran, 2011;
Nagle, 2010; Williams & McConnell, 2011). Elaborating upon these, I
contend that [the **methodological nationalism** of the
disciplines]{.underline} of economics and international relations -- [in
which]{.underline} much of [the **liberal view is based**]{.underline}
-- [has left them in a **sorry state** in making sense of recent
political development throughout the world]{.underline}, specifically
when addressing the contemporary rise of reactionary forms of populism.

In this sense, [the **high degrees of violence** and **vulnerability**
associated with processes of market integration have **often escaped the
radars** of economics and IR analyses, **fixated** as they are with
**mono-scale scrutiny** of national economies and state-to-state
relations]{.underline}. Although some liberal IR scholars have laid the
grounds for a less normative paradigm that incorporates domestic
variables and bottom-up societal processes into the understanding of
state action, [the **assumption remains** that policy interdependence
and compatibility between states, combined with]{.underline} the
Pareto-efficient outcomes of [globally integrated]{.underline}
production and [trade, result in '**strong incentives for coexistence
with low conflict**']{.underline} (Moravcsik, 1997, p. 521; see also
Oneal & Russett, 1997; McDonald & Sweeney, 2007). [**Recent
developments** suggest there are **fundamental flaws** with this
**largely deductive hypothesis**]{.underline}. [Whereas on **aggregate
terms**, and according to **some measurements**, nation-states may have
**benefitted more** or **less from globalization**, **social conflict**
occurring at **multiple scales** -- and indeed in a class-based
dimension -- is an **undeniable constitutive element** of state
action]{.underline}, the latter reflecting and/or attempting to contain
particular constellations of social forces and their interests. In this
way, [the **damage inflicted** upon many by **increasingly disembedded
markets** and **post-political states** that shield policy from popular
deliberation (both the **products of the liberal agenda**) are at the
**very root** of the current crisis of liberal hegemony]{.underline}
(Gonzalez-Vicente & Carroll, 2017).

In what follows, I draw upon a variety of cases to explain how a
dialectical approach to liberalism, neoliberalism and their illiberal
responses,1 and a multi-scalar analysis of market violence are
indispensable in explaining much of the turbulence that world politics
faces today. To be clear, the paper's goal is not to deny that state
leaders factor in the economic repercussions of conflict when they
contemplate its possibility -- a logical assumption of
**[liberal]{.underline}** **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations scholarship. The aim is instead to argue
that these [**calculations tell very little** about the **nature of
peace** and **conflict** as historically bounded processes that need to
be studied in relation to broader transformations in the global
political economy]{.underline}, the latter affecting state behaviour in
terms of both economic policy and inter-state rivalry. In this way, and
crucially, [I]{.underline} also wish to [**refute the liberal argument**
that the **pursuit of economic integration** at any (social) cost will
**unequivocally lower the prospects for international conflict**
or]{.underline}, indeed, **[structural violence]{.underline}** more
broadly understood as a multi-scalar phenomenon.

The paper is structured as follows. The next section problematizes the
concept of peace in IRT, with a more detailed discussion of economic
liberalism. The following section presents a temporal critique,
contextualizing the contemporary rise of illiberal politics within the
transformation of the global political economy under world market
capitalism. After this, I build upon Agnew (1994) to develop a scalar
critique and argue that liberalism's methodological nationalism hampers
a proper assessment of the transnational dimensions of processes such as
development, violence or peace. I chart various scales of market-induced
violence and vulnerability (as a form of economic violence) in the
global era, tracing the rescaling of violence and risk from the
interstate scale to the individual sphere. I conclude by discussing the
transition from a 'durable disorder' (Cerny, 1998) to an emerging
(albeit contested) new populist order under world market capitalism. To
do so, I echo Polanyi and Marx in contending that processes of
marketization, replete as they are with contradiction, cannot engender
liberal or capitalist peace, but result instead in anti-liberal
reactions of various kinds (what Polanyi called 'counter movements') to
the violence of unrestrained markets. Importantly, these counter
movements can often take reactionary characteristics, as people under
threat or the perception of threat retreat into culture and nationalism
against the 'other' and internationalism in all its variants.

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE LIBERAL PEACE

While the pursuit of peace is a central preoccupation for progressive IR
scholarship, peace as a concept and as an actual manifestation is rarely
discussed in the IR literature. Instead, [peace often appears as a
**negative occurrence**, intuitively understood as the **avoidance of
war** or an **absence of overt inter-state violence**]{.underline}
(Galtung, 1969; Richmond, 2016, p. 57). Thereby, most IR literature
focuses on the challenges to state-based peace, with commentary
typically dominated by the two main competing schools, realism and
liberalism, both subdivided into further dissenting subcamps.
Conventional [realist approaches take the '**anarchic**' or **violent
nature** of international politics as a **given** and place their focus
on states' survival strategies]{.underline}. Offensive realists warn of
the disruptive effects of 'power transitions' and in the contemporary
context claim, for example, that as China grows economically and
militarily, and as its interests expand and it seeks greater influence,
tensions with other countries are certain to arise (Mearsheimer, 2014).
Defensive neorealists hold similar assumptions about the foundations of
the international system, yet contend that states privilege security
over domination and that the incentives for conflict are contingent
rather than endemic, with balances of power potentially keeping states
at bay and preventing conflict (Waltz, 1979).

[Liberal theorists]{.underline} dispute these interpretations and
[**reject** that competition alone guides state behaviour]{.underline}.
Elaborating on the Kantian ideal of 'perpetual peace', and drawing upon
Adam Smith, David Ricardo or John Stuart Mill, [liberal theories contend
that **economic integration** and **institutional enmeshment** or
**socialization exercise a constraining force on conflict** and are
**conductive to peaceful scenarios**]{.underline} (Doyle, 1986; Howard,
1981; Johnston, 2008; Keohane & Nye, 1977). While there is no absolute
agreement on the exact shape that such 'interdependence' should take
(Mansfield & Pollins, 2001), [liberal IR scholars]{.underline} often
[hold that **large-scale conflict** in the 21st century can be
**avoided** if the liberal world order **survives the relative decline**
of the United States and manages to **assimilate rising
powers**]{.underline} such as China. The emphasis is placed both on
institutions and norms of reciprocity, on the one hand, and on economic
integration, on the other. Regarding the latter, and evoking Smithian
language, [the agenda for a '**capitalist peace**' assumes that free
markets represent '"a **hidden hand**" that ... build(s) up
**irrevocable** and **peaceful connections** between
states']{.underline} (Gartzke, 2007; Richmond, 2008, p. 23), [and that
'**put simply**, **globalisation promotes peace**']{.underline} (Gartzke
& Li, 2003, p. 562). [The theory]{.underline} is in many ways deductive,
but [relies]{.underline} also [on the **statistical data** that on
aggregate tends **partially** to support the liberal peace
argument]{.underline} (except for the period leading to the First World
War; see also Barbieri, 1996) [and on the '**logic**' that national
leaders are **not expected to act irrationally** or **be insensitive**
'to **economic loss** and the **preferences of powerful domestic
actors**']{.underline} (Hegre, Oneal, & Russett, 2010, p. 772).

A more nuanced exposition of the liberal argument suggests that what
brings nations together and heightens the opportunity cost of conflict
is market integration according to a set of commonly devised regulations
-- rather than the realization of an ideal 'free' trade archetype
(Moravcsik, 2005). This results in a sort of 'embedded liberalism', with
the successful integration of postSoviet states and China in world
market capitalism through World Trade Organization (WTO) membership and
other liberalizing initiatives understood as a deterrent to military
action and, hence, as an effective strategy for both global growth and
security, particularly in the face of China's rising economic and
military might (Funabashi, Oksenberg, & Weiss, 1994). [From this
perspective]{.underline}, not only is violence avoidable but also
**[peace may]{.underline}** indeed [**be engineered** with the creation
of a **world market society**]{.underline} being key to this endeavour
[as well as]{.underline} to the broader goal of crafting [a **liberal
hegemony** able to deliver a veritable '**end of history**' where
markets and functioning liberal democracies prevail]{.underline}
(Fukuyama, 1992). The engineering of market-orientated democracies has
indeed often been the main task of liberal peace- and state-building
operatives in post-conflict areas (Campbell, Chandler, & Sabaratnam,
2011).

[Yet, **decades of neoliberal integration have not brought Fukuyama's
prophecy closer to its realization**. Across the world, liberal market
integration]{.underline} has facilitated convivial relations among key
countries and paid important dividends to elites, yet it
[has]{.underline} also [resulted in the concentration of wealth in
**ever fewer hands**, **rising inequalities** within
countries]{.underline} (although not between them) [and **higher
concentration of wealth** at the top, and **increased risks** and
**vulnerability** as the logic of market competitiveness takes hold of
many aspects of our lives]{.underline} (Anand & Segal, 2015; Lynch,
2006). The relation between the United States and China or the processes
of economic integration in the European Union are clear examples of
these trends. In these places as well as others, [inequalities,
precarization and economic insecurity have given way to]{.underline} a
[**populist** and **nationalist momentum**]{.underline} that can be
interpreted both as a popular response to the extreme and diverse forms
of violence engendered by processes of market integration, or as a
manoeuvre to channel discontent towards the 'other' in order to protect
elite interests (Gonzalez-Vicente & Carroll, 2017). [By **prescribing
ever more market globalization to counter populist politics** and
**avoid conflict**, liberal elites **add fuel to the fire** as they
**sever the very conditions** that led to the **disfranchisement of
significant segments of the population** in the first
place]{.underline}. Thereby, it is crucial to understand how [the
argument for capitalist peace **fails to factor in the crisis-prone**
and **socially destructive tendencies** of capitalism, particularly in a
context of **unfenced global competitiveness**]{.underline} along market
lines.2

Two of the underlying problems in the liberal peace argument stand out.
The first has to do with the statistical selection of fixed points in
time that suggest correlations between growth in trade and diminished
conflict -- while failing to discern mechanisms of causation (Hayes,
2012). A wider temporal lens is needed to situate the contemporary rise
of mercantilist and illiberal politics in the context of neoliberal
globalization, representing the same sort of 'counter movement' that
Polanyi had warned of in his reading of the 19th-century downward spiral
towards war -- aided in our contemporary case by the demise of the
traditional left (Blyth & Matthijs, 2017; Carroll & Gonzalez-Vicente,
2017). The second problem relates to liberal international political
economy and IRT's scalar fixation on inter-state matters and hence their
inability to factor in violence in the absence of war. I turn now to
these two points.

NEOLIBERALISM'S ILLIBERAL MOMENT AS COUNTER MOVEMENT

[**On paper**, the]{.underline} two intertwined [arguments for liberal
peace would **seem to make sense**]{.underline}: if countries remove the
barriers to trade and investment and choose to specialize in their
comparative advantages, international productivity will be raised and we
will enjoy a more prosperous global economy with satisfied consumers and
states; also, if states develop close economic linkages, they will have
important material incentives to avoid conflict with one another. [In
the **real world**, competition]{.underline} between jurisdictions and
social groups [**implies often** that the **development** and
**prosperity of some** is based on the **exploitation** and
**vulnerability of others**, as]{.underline} typically [emphasized
by]{.underline} the extensive literature on bifurcated economies,
[**temporally constrained** and **contradictory growth patterns**, and
**uneven** and **destructive forms of development**]{.underline}. In
this way, [it is **not** that economic interdependence, when **removed
from its social context** and **put under the microscope**, **does not
raise the costs of conflict**. **However**, the **political choices**
and **social transformations needed** to achieve interdependence are a
**key variable**]{.underline} to understanding a state's behaviour and
predisposition to conflict. [And while governments **may in many
junctures align** with the interests of capital, they are **not immune
to crises of legitimacy**]{.underline}, and will need to mediate issues
of accumulation and social cohesion when people perceive the social
transformations required to achieve interdependence to have a negative
impact on their lives (Jessop, 2016, p. 189). This will reflect in a way
or another on state behaviour as political elites, current and
prospective, jostle for votes and/or legitimacy.

[A **key problem** with the argument for liberal peace lies in its
emphasis on **narrow temporal correlations** between trade and (lack of)
conflict, which **removes interdependence** from its broader political
economic context, **disembedding peace** and **conflict** from the
**broader set of historically bounded** and **politically contingent
social relations** that underpin them. A **widened analytical timeframe
renders clear the dialectical relationship** between (neo)liberal social
projects and their social responses, both progressive and reactionary.
Whereas high volumes of trade **may coincide** at a particular
'**optimal**' period of liberal expansionism with interstate peace, they
**may also**]{.underline} transform societies in ways that [**engender
the conditions** for a potential '**illiberal**' turn or counter
movement resulting in a **higher risk of conflict** as
**beggar-thy-neighbour positions emerge** and **new enemies need to be
sought** by political elites to bind national-constrained constituencies
to their agendas to maintain power]{.underline}.

[We can observe this temporal incongruity in]{.underline} the work of
some of the [**key proponents** of the capitalist peace]{.underline}.
For example, [**Oneal** and **Russett**]{.underline} (1999, p. 439)
argue that trade 'sharply reduces the onset of or involvement in
militarized disputes among contiguous and major-power pairs', which are
identified by Maoz and Russett (1993) as the set of countries more
likely to enter into conflict with each other. Despite Oneal and
Russett's sophisticated [approach]{.underline} to the [data]{.underline}
(modelling, for example, to avoid 'false negatives' by factoring in
geographic contiguity, or controlling for alliances) and the attention
paid to statistical rejections of the liberal peace argument, trade
interdependence and the occurrence of conflict are analyzed [on a
**year-by-year basis**]{.underline} (Oneal & Russett, 1999, p. 428).
[This is **also the case with other comparable studies**]{.underline}
(Hegre, 2000; Oneal & Russett, 2001; Souva & Prins, 2006). [This
temporal frame is **problematic**, as inter-national conflict tends to
**build up over prolonged periods of time**, and the adverse impacts of
interdependence and liberal integration are **more likely to result
first in crisis** and **social dislocation**, followed by some sort of
**economic distancing**]{.underline} (perhaps under a new administration
that replaces the one that embraced liberalization) [and a **wide range
of policy measures**, before leading to **military
conflict**]{.underline} -- underpinned either by the state that
perceives that liberal integration is having negative impacts on
socioeconomic development, or more often than not by the one which wants
to prevent the deterioration of important trade and investment links.

Here, [one **vital issue** often left out]{.underline} of the liberal
peace equations [is the fact that **most military
interventions**]{.underline} in the post-Second World War period [were
aimed at **disciplining countries that opted out** of the United States'
**global liberalizing project**]{.underline} and sought to pursue a
variety of indigenous pathways to modernity, often including many that
did so under the rubric of socialism, democratically achieved or
otherwise. [The **reverse is also true**, as countries that **chose to
ally** with the United States]{.underline} during the Cold War [were
**shielded from attacks**, and]{.underline} in some cases [given
**preferential trade access**, **technology transfer** and allowed to
**engage in market protection**. In this context, associating conflict
with the **lack of strong trade links**, rather than to the **meticulous
unfolding** of a **market-based imperial agenda**, would be tantamount
to concluding that **low opium consumption was responsible for British
military expeditions** in 19th-century China]{.underline}. [While there
is **certainly a correlation**]{.underline} between China's ban on opium
and British intervention, **[nobody could seriously suggest that opium
consumption reduces interstate conflict]{.underline}**. Similarly, in
many of these cases, [it is **not** that the **absence of trade results
in conflict**, but]{.underline} on the contrary, [that military
intervention has **often been aimed at expanding markets** and
**protecting investment**]{.underline}.

This situation is aptly explained by Richmond (2006), who discusses
'virtual' peace and emphasizes how [war and peace can be **synonymous**
in countries **subjected to military intervention in the name of liberal
peace**]{.underline}. Old examples of this practice would include the
above-mentioned Opium Wars or indeed most colonial wars to open new
market frontiers. Cold War [**examples abound**, from]{.underline} the
CIA-supported assassination of Salvador Allende following his policies
of nationalization and collectivization in **[Chile]{.underline}**,
[to]{.underline} the training of Contras to oust the Sandinista National
Liberation Front in **[Nicaragua]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} the
perennial yoke on **[Cuba]{.underline}** to seed the ground for a
market-friendly regime.3 While these interventions were justified on the
basis of dubious arguments regarding the national security of the
attacking country, today these rationales cohabit with moral claims for
'human security' and humanitarian intervention in the target countries,
although many authors have suggested that these moral arguments often
conceal Realpolitik motivations (Chandler, 2004). [The **Iraq War** is a
case in point]{.underline}, having achieved a boom in trading links
between Iraq and United States following the 2003 invasion, with a
six-fold increase of trade between 2002 and 2008 that only started to
decline following the discovery of shale oil reserves in the United
States (United States Census Bureau, 2017), but having achieved very
little in terms of curbing internal violence.

[The **liberal peace fixation with short-term correlations between trade
openness** and the **absence of grand inter-national conflict** is
**particularly perplexing** if one considers how the liberal argument
for economic development **dismisses the immediate social dislocations**
underpinned by market integration as **tangential** to longer term
improvements for all segments of society]{.underline} (Garret, 1998, p.
796). Here, it would seem that liberal arguments for peace and
development operate under different temporal logics. If
[liberalism's]{.underline} positive impacts on peace are attested with a
focus on yearly correlations between commerce and an absence of
conflict, its **[alleged positive]{.underline}** developmental
[**impacts** can]{.underline} often [be supported **only by eschewing**
the **immediate social conflict** and **diminished living standards
fomented by interdependence** and **marketization** -- see]{.underline},
for example, the arguments for structural adjustment throughout [the
**developing world in the 1980s** and **1990s** or **more recent
austerity policies in Europe**]{.underline}, which, incidentally, many
authors have demonstrated to be also counterproductive for long-term
development (Blyth, 2013; Chang, 2007).

This last example brings one back to the contemporary juncture.
[**Across the world**, we are observing an **emergence of illiberal
politics** in countries that have represented the **backbone of
neoliberal globalization**]{.underline}, and indeed at its very
Anglo-American core. In many places, [reactionary politicians have been
**first** to galvanize social discontent successfully by **publicly
condemning the negative social impacts of economic
globalization**]{.underline}, such as increased inequalities and growing
insecurity. In the United States, the UK or France, for example, it has
been [the populist right]{.underline} that [has **more prominently
hoisted the anti-globalization flag**, even if its discourses place
targets on ethnic minorities or national trade imbalances, rather than
on class inequality]{.underline} or the increased leverage of businesses
in processes of transnational integration. We can see, for example, how
rising job insecurity and deteriorating living standards in the UK were
mobilized by the Brexit campaign. While much of the 'Leave' discourse
was problematic, and focused its anger towards European Union
regulations and immigrants, Brexit advocates successfully tapped into a
widespread sense of vulnerability and precarization throughout the isles
that is intimately linked to neoliberal transformations at home and to
the consolidation of the world market and its competitive pressures more
broadly (Pettifor, 2017; The Guardian, 2016). Similarly, Donald Trump's
antiChina and anti-migrant rhetoric resonated with the experiences of
many in the middle class who have been on the losing side of growing
inequality and declining social mobility for decades, but also
remarkably in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis, with the top
1% capturing 85.1% of the country's income growth between 2009 and 2013
(Economic Policy Institute, 2016). Indeed, [there are **striking
similarities** in the protestations of politicians at **opposite ends**
of the spectrum]{.underline}, such as Trump and Bernie Sanders, [despite
proposing diametrically opposed treatments to the perceived
problems]{.underline}, with Trump doing little to upset the
business-centric order and only adding bigotry and defensive nationalism
into the mix.4

In this way, [this rise of illiberal positions and movements **must not
be seen as a diversion** from the road to neoliberal globalization, but
rather a **direct consequence** of the consolidation of the world market
facilitated by neoliberal policy sets and the techno-logistical
developments underpinning globalized forms of accumulation]{.underline}.
The current illiberal rise is hence aptly interpreted both as a counter
movement in the Polanyian sense, and as a dialectical relationship.
[Although the **detrimental social impacts** of liberal integration are
**often felt rather swiftly by many**, their reverberations into
politics take the shape of **more prolonged reactions**. Yet, there is a
**strong association between liberal integration**, its **social
impacts** and the **rearticulations of politics that follow** and that
we **currently experience** in many parts of the world]{.underline}
(Gonzalez-Vicente & Carroll, 2017). [The current rise of various kinds
of populism]{.underline} -- [in]{.underline} places as diverse as [the
**United States**, the **UK**, **Indonesia**, **Russia**, **Turkey** or
the **Philippines**]{.underline}, to name a few--
[represents]{.underline} from this perspective [a '**counter
movement**']{.underline} following a 'global organic crisis'(Gill,
2015), as people look beyond the mainstream for alternatives that
explain and respond [to]{.underline} the social dislocations brought
about by the pursuit of transnational liberal integration. In this way,
neoliberalism's illiberal moment is in a dialectical relationship with
[the **pursuit of a liberal utopia**]{.underline}, mirroring the
Polanyian counter movement that would put an end to the 'Hundred Years
Peace' (1815--1914). Most importantly, the traditional centre left's
failure in many contexts to formulate viable responses to the current
social dislocation has left it up to the reactionary right to devise a
way out of the crisis.5 More often than not, the leaders of the new
populist moment combine an enduring business- and market-centric
approach to development with nationalist and reactionary discourse,
resulting in a dangerous blend that is likely to perpetuate social
discontent, but redirecting it not towards the policy and economic
elites responsible of the current developmental impasse but towards
countries that are increasingly perceived as rivals.

THE MULTIPLE SCALES OF VIOLENT NEOLIBERALISM

How are we then [to explain the **inability of**]{.underline} mainstream
**[liberal approaches to predict]{.underline}** what seems to be a
logical turn -- in the form of a societal defence or Polanyian 'counter
movement' versus [the **inequalities**, **risks** and
**vulnerabilities** fomented by the world market]{.underline}? Much of
the problem lies within IRT's scalar limitations, which we can explore
by focusing on the disjunction between the interstate scale and the
diversity of political economic processes and social conflict occurring
at other scales. This disjunction is with no doubt closely related to
IRT's development and consolidation in the post-Second World War years,
a period characterized by particular patterns of growth of national
development, marked ideological preferences and methodological
nationalism -- although at that point **[debates]{.underline}** on
structural violence and positive peace already existed in the margins of
the field of IR (Gleditsch, Nordkvelle, & Strand, 2014). These all
[resulted in]{.underline} what John Agnew famously described as IRT's
'territorial trap', [a **fixation** with the **interstate scale** and
the assumption that **states are containers of societies**, with
politics played in a **domestic/foreign binary**]{.underline} (Agnew,
1994). Below, I expand on this notion to discuss how violence or risk
have been rescaled in the neoliberal era from the interstate realm and
into the individual one, with societies taking on the costs of a
competitive market integration that has allowed for -- at least
temporarily -- relatively convivial relations between key states (and
the elites who control them) mediating the global economic architecture
(on risk, see also Beck, 1999).

IRT's territorial trap remains ubiquitous. Despite decades of powerful
critiques that have presented the post-Westphalian nation-state as a
never fully realized political moment and a site of social conflict
(Agnew, 1994; Mitchell, 1991), [states remain an **ontological
fixation**]{.underline} at the core of IRT. This is even more so the
case when it comes to the understanding of conflict and peace. Whereas
the field of IR is today increasingly open to accepting
['**non-traditional**' security threats such as **organized crime**,
**terrorism** or **epidemics**]{.underline}, these [are]{.underline} to
a great degree [studied as **anomalies** in a state-based system, and
considered **only inasmuch** as they **pose a threat to state
order**]{.underline}. Typologies of war such as the Correlates of War
(COW) Data Sets accept [non-state entities]{.underline} as potential
actors of conflict. However, these are narrowly defined as
'nonterritorial entities or non-state armed groups' that are not
formally accepted as members of the interstate system but which [**must
contest the power of a state** or at least **represent a violent
challenge to state** or **state-like entities** in order to be agents of
conflict]{.underline} (COW Wars v. 4.0, 2014). According to this
understanding, [peace is not only **negatively constructed** as the
**absence of violence**]{.underline} (Williams & McConnell, 2011, p.
928), [but in particular as the **absence of violence explicitly
directed at the state** or at **gaining control of a
state**]{.underline}.

[This **monoscalar conceptualization** of peace and conflict **pervades
liberal IRT**]{.underline}, too, [which **considers the state the key
actor**]{.underline} in international relations, and markets the
connecting fabric **[holding international peace
together]{.underline}**. Gartzke and Li argue, for example, how the
demonstrators who took the streets 'from Seattle to Switzerland and from
Gothenburg to Jakarta ... mobilised by apocalyptic visions of the menace
of globalisation' failed to recognize that economic integration offers
mutual benefits to states that opt for settlements in the place of
fighting (Gartzke & Li, 2003, p. 562). This is, of course, a caricature
of 'alter-globalisation' movements that fails to acknowledge the
transnational networks behind such movements.6 Yet, it is a useful
example to show how, [by **focusing on states**]{.underline} as the
aggregate beneficiaries of 'efficient' modes of transnational production
and exchange, [liberal scholarship **eschews the variegated forms of
politico-economic conflict** that market reordering **foments at
intrastate scales**]{.underline}.

The crucial point is that, [with the complexities of global dynamics
**flattened into a chessboard of one-dimensional state actors**,
mainstream IR perspectives are often **unable to address the multiscalar
violent repercussions** of liberal market integration and therefore its
challenges to]{.underline} positive peace -- understood as ['the
**possibility of maximising human potential**']{.underline} (Flint,
2005, p. 7) [and the **absence of structural**, **cultural** and
**environmental violence**]{.underline} (Galtung, 1996; Richmond, 2008,
p. 89). [Peace, much like war, operates at '**intertwined** and
**mutually constitutive**' scales, from the **intimate** to the
**global**]{.underline} (Koopman, 2011, p. 194). **[Anchored
in]{.underline}** mid-20th-century [**statist notions** of world
politics, conventional]{.underline} IR [understandings]{.underline} of
peace and conflict [are **oblivious** to threats to everyday peace when
state power is **not directly under challenge**]{.underline}. In this
way, foreign direct investment or trade are considered phenomena that
bring states more closely integrated, hence either increasing the
likelihood of peace (from the liberal perspective) or not necessarily
having an impact on the probability of conflict in the long term (from
the realist perspective).

Yet, [the undemocratic trends]{.underline} behind processes of
transnationalization of capital [**reproduce new** and **old forms of
violence**]{.underline}. John Nagle, a political anthropologist of
ethnic conflict, highlights, for example, how [global market integration
may indeed '**cause a violent backlash** if economic reconstruction
**dispossesses groups** from their land or **dismantles their
traditional economic systems** without providing acceptable
alternatives']{.underline} (Nagle, 2010, p. 232), or what could also be
described as processes of primitive accumulation without immediate
proletarianization. [The creation of masses of unemployed
youth]{.underline}, surplus to the immediate exploitative needs of
capital, [is]{.underline} of course [an **important factor** behind the
rise of violence in many societies]{.underline}, as, for example, many
in the Caribbean (Pantin, 1996). Moreover, [these processes of
dispossession and the dismantling of livelihoods are **per se violent
by-products** of neoliberal integration]{.underline}.

[Violent neoliberalism, mediated]{.underline} not by an invisible hand
but [by explicit elite interests]{.underline} (Harvey, 2005) or more
subject-based processes of governmentality (Larner, 2000), is a
recurrent phenomenon in the study of the globalization of capitalism.
The integration of 'developing countries' with global markets [is
**typically plagued with violent rationales** of development and
**tangible issues of exploitation** and **dispossession**, as **vividly
exemplified** in]{.underline} Simon Springer's studies of violent
neoliberalism in **[Cambodia]{.underline}** (Springer, 2015). An
important issue to be considered here is the transformation of the state
alongside processes of economic globalization, adopting increasingly
competitive and regulatory forms, and ubiquitously morphing into what
some have described as 'capitalist states' (Jessop, 2002). This
transformation implies that, through processes of disciplinary
neoliberalism (Gill, 1995), states can in fact mediate between global
competitive forces and domestic societies not to protect the latter from
outside dangers or the recurring crises of capitalism, but in fact to
impose measures of austerity, protect creditors, and in general promote
more precarious and vulnerable patterns of living.

[A **powerful example** of violent neoliberalism is found in processes
of **worker exploitation** fomented by flexible regimes of accumulation
required to attract capital investment. This explains why **70,000
workplace casualties** in China]{.underline} during 2012 (The Economist,
2013) -- a country where workers' independent organization is to a great
extent illegal, or 180,000 protests in 2010 (The Wall Street Journal,
2011), [**do not affect IR's calculations of peace**, despite the
**close link** between these incidents and **exploitation dynamics**
associated with **China's integration into global markets**]{.underline}
(Chan, 2001). It is only from this perspective that IR scholars in China
can present their country's growing economic pre-eminence as a 'peaceful
rise', arguing that 'the Chinese have made \[the choice\] to embrace
economic globalization rather than detach themselves from it' (Zheng,
2005). Ironically, given the ostensible incompatibility between liberal
emphases upon freedom and pluralism and state propaganda, Chinese
official media also suggests that globalization and peace provide
'favourable conditions for building a harmonious society', where 'the
political environment is stable, the economy is prosperous, people live
in peace and work in comfort and social welfare improves' (People's
Daily, 2007). The actual 'harmonisation' of society in China has indeed
entailed occasional improvements in welfare provision and some
concessions to labour -- for example, in the form of a new Labour
Contract Law in 2007 that required firms to give written contracts to
their workers. Yet, disciplinary measures hold sway, and the very
lawyers who sought to protect worker rights under the Labour Contract
Law framework are being incarcerated under the charges of 'disturbing
social order', while income inequality and labour unrest have continued
to rise (Financial Times, 2016; Hui & Chan, 2011). And crucially,
[intrastate violence can in turn be **rescaled to the inter-national
sphere**]{.underline}. Therefore, [analysts **often associate** the rise
in protests and repression in China with the Chinese Communist Party's
**orchestration of** and **permissiveness towards nationalist
campaigns** and **patriotic discourse** -- including typical recourse to
international belligerence over disputed territories and anti-Western
rhetoric -- in search for legitimacy]{.underline} (Hughes, 2006).

Similarly, [there has been an **emergence of inequality**,
**vulnerability** and **precarization** in economically developed
countries]{.underline} that can also be analyzed under the framework of
violent neoliberalism. As transnational capital benefits from exploiting
the world's largest unfree labour force in China and other low and
middle income countries, middle classes elsewhere have seen their rights
and economic power decline. [In the United States, the last decades of
globalization and prosperity have been accompanied by **increased levels
of poverty**, a **net decline of 2.7 million jobs**]{.underline} between
2001 and 2011, [and **declining inflation-adjusted minimum
wages**]{.underline} (Mischel & Davis, 2015; Scott, 2015; Shaefer &
Edin, 2013). [Marketization has reached **grotesque proportions**, and
today even the **disciplinary apparatus of the state is up for sale**,
resulting in **skyrocketing incarceration rates**, chiefly affecting
**impoverished populations** and the **African American
community**]{.underline} (BBC, 2014). [In **Spain**, a **rampant series
of evictions**]{.underline} following the 2008 Global Financial Crisis
-- [with **over 600,000 foreclosures**]{.underline} from 2008 to 2015
(El País, 2015) -- [left families **homeless**]{.underline} while
political elites transferred €100 billion of public wealth to private
and privatized financial institutions, with four-fifths of the sum
deemed unrecoverable according to the estimations of the Spanish Central
Bank. [Global and national processes have]{.underline} in this way
[**powerful impacts** on other scales, including the **personal lived
experiences** of crisis]{.underline}. In the United States, studies find
that the 40% rise in suicides since 1999 is connected to the recession
of 2007--09, while the World Health Organisation (WHO) observes a 60%
increase in suicide rates across the world over the last 45 years that
appears to be connected to periodic spikes in economic hardship
(Oyesanya, Lopez-Morinigo, & Dutta, 2015; Whiteman, 2015). [With global
affluence concentrated in **increasingly fewer hands**]{.underline}
(with eight people having the same amount of wealth as 50% of the
world's population according to some studies; Hardoon, 2017), [and with
**risk gradually removed** from markets and transferred to increasingly
vulnerable individuals, **national illiberal politics** has come to
constitute a **logical reaction** to the liberal order for
many]{.underline}, or a quest for refuge from the violence of markets,
however fraught the responses offered by many of the populist
alternatives now in vogue.

[Another **vivid example** of violent neoliberalism is seen in the
**apparent capitulation** of the **future of the world's environment**
and the **present livelihoods of many** to the **immediate needs of
capital**. Here we see the **expansion of capitalist activities** in
search of **previously untapped resources** in the developing world and
elsewhere **driving conflict with local populations** and **fomenting
processes of internal colonialism** and **dispossession**]{.underline}
(Gonzalez-Vicente, 2017; Kaag & Zoomers, 2014). [Even a **wide range of
allegedly well-intentioned initiatives to preserve biodiversity**
operate now according to **market logics**, relying on the **valuation**
and **commodification of nature** and the deployment of green
credentials ultimately to **displace populations**]{.underline} in ways
that are reminiscent of processes of primitive accumulation (Fairhead,
Leachm, & Scoones, 2012; Lohmann, 2010). And, of course, [climate change
and environmental degradation in general have become **key drivers of
global migrations**]{.underline}, with the risk of being displaced by
natural disasters today being 60% higher than 40 years ago and 25.4
million people needing to migrate every year to escape the consequences
of natural disasters (Greenpeace, 2017, p. 6). Crucial here -- once
again -- is the fact that [our current global environmental crisis
**cannot be understood outside the context of global liberal
integration**, as the promotion of '**good business
environments**']{.underline} (note the irony) [and **competition across
jurisdictions** to attract capital investments have resulted in **any
attempt to make businesses pay** for the environmental 'externalities'
of production being **just a marginal note** in a **downward
trajectory** towards an **environmental dystopia**]{.underline}.

These violent by-products of liberal integration operate at scales that
go from the global to the intimate. Yet, [despite the **vast amounts of
empirical evidence** illustrating the **violence inherent** in processes
of marketization]{.underline}, the **[epistemological
limitations]{.underline}** of IRT [create **illusions of liberal peace**
in the absence of conflict between states]{.underline}. The examples
above illustrate how [state-based peace is **limited** in its
implications for the **everyday lives of many people** and may even be
**counterproductive at diverse scales** where violence is
**systematically applied** and **justified to perpetuate liberal state
peace** and **market integration**]{.underline}. Importantly, people are
not just victims of violence, but agents of political change. If at an
early stage of globalization liberal elites were able to contain
discontent through appeals to technical prowess, claims of a lack of
viable alternatives (see, for example, Margaret Thatcher's famous 'there
is no alternative' mantra) and the depoliticization of policy more
broadly, today we observe a process of re-politicization that often
takes reactionary forms (Gonzalez-Vicente & Carroll, 2017).
[While]{.underline} in some countries progressive alternatives to the
liberal order are revitalizing the political debate, and indeed
[solidarity campaigns have **delivered some important victories across
the world**]{.underline}, what we observe in many places today is the
conjunction of national reactionary discourse (with elites placing
responsibilities for the social crisis on foreign forces and migrants,
for example) and a continued hegemony of markets. [This new populist
order **dangerously combines** an economic base that will **continue to
produce market violence** with nationalist rationales that **undermine
internationalist solidarity**, and]{.underline} which unfortunately
[**invite further violence** towards the 'other']{.underline}.

Introduction

[Canonical texts in i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
[define peace as the absence of violence]{.underline} (Aron 1973, 21;
Bull 2012, 18; Clausewitz 1976, 75; Waltz 1959, 1; 1979, 343). [However,
a glance at the philology of the word "peace" reveals a more complex
relationship with violence]{.underline}. The Latin words for peace (pax,
pacis, paco) trace their roots to the verb for a pact (pacisci), "which
ended a war and led to submission, friendship, or alliance." As Rome
transitioned from republic to empire, pax changed its meaning from a
pact among equals to submission to Rome, and "pacare began to refer to
conquest" (Weinstock 1960, 45).1

Two monuments built by Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, record this
shift in the meaning of peace. The first, the Ara Pacis Augustae, a
monument to the goddess of peace, commemorates Augustus's pacification
of Gaul and Spain (Kleiner 2005, 212). The second, the funerary
inscription Res Gestae Divi Augusti, appeared on Augustus's tomb and
celebrates his many accomplishments, including bringing peace to the
sea, Gaul, Spain, and the Alps. Crucially, the term used to characterize
this peace is pacavi, which means pacified. Pacavi is not the absence of
violence but the use of violence to reorder the world into a Roman
Empire. Thus, Pax Romana meant eliminating the threat of war---both
civil and foreign---through the preponderance of Roman military might.

[Romans understood peace to include both the absence of violence and the
forceful creation and maintenance of a political order: pacification.
Modern scholars]{.underline} in the field, however, [understand violence
and peace as antonyms. While some researchers question the meaning of
peace]{.underline} (Martín 2005; Richmond 2008), [the field almost never
scrutinizes its concepts of violence]{.underline}.2 In fact, scholars of
international relations seldom even use the term (Thomas 2011,
1815--16).

Inspired by this anamnesis analysis of pax, we argue that [violence
functions as a structural feature of the world---even a seemingly
peaceful world]{.underline}.3 [Violence is not the absence of peace
but]{.underline}, rather, as the Romans recognized, [the ordering
feature of the pax. Violence constitutes modern society]{.underline}. We
argue for a phenomenological understanding of violence to reframe how we
might theorize what violence is. [[Our approach]{.underline}]{.mark}
does not contest the basic character of violence (harm, death, and so
forth.). Rather, it [[identifies violence as **a structuring feature of
the world**]{.underline}]{.mark}, one [[that conditions and enables
political, social, and economic relations. We define this process as
**pacification**: the process of rendering invisible what
scholars]{.mark} in the field [identify as direct and indirect
violence]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article proceeds in four parts. In part one, we identify a
conceptual gap at the heart of much international relations scholarship
about violence. We show that [scholars generally conceptualize violence
as either direct]{.underline} (the consequence of empirically
identifiable behaviors) [or indirect]{.underline} (behaviors that in the
aggregate cause violence via the institutions of modern society). Across
mainstream and critical literatures alike, [scholars understand violence
as a specific thing, the effects of which we can observe, count,
measure, and potentially eliminate]{.underline}. In part two, [[we
introduce a **phenomenological methodology** for theorizing
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}. We show how [[violence operates **even
when it is unobservable**]{.mark}. Observable violence can function as a
rupture that reveals the hidden violence of pacification]{.underline}.
In part three, we develop our account of [[violence as
pacification]{.underline}]{.mark}, which we argue [[is **central to
the**]{.mark} **development of the [liberal world
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Anarchist thought reveals the pacification
in liberal capitalism. Postcolonial thought reveals the pacification in
colonialism. In part four, we demonstrate the theoretical value of our
tripartite classification of violence: direct, indirect, and
pacification. [Our [understanding]{.mark} of [pacification as violence
allows us to account for]{.mark} both [the empirical observation of the
liberal peace]{.mark} as leading to a decline in direct violence [and
the claim that the Pax Americana represents **an increase in violence
overall**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**------ Footnotes ------**

1 Pacare is a conjugation of paco, the Latin verb meaning to pacify or
subdue.

theoretical understandings of the concept. See also Calkivik (2016) and
Rodriguez-Alcázar (2017).

### ! -- Structural Root Causes

#### Crisis avoidance makes [extinction inevitable]{.underline} by occluding the [structural causes]{.underline} of instability and fueling [militarized conflict]{.underline} around the globe\-\--interrogating their epistemological failures is a [pre-requisite]{.underline} to effective policy

**Ahmed 11** -- Nafeez Mosaddeq Ahmed, International Security Analyst,
Executive Director at the Institute for Policy Research and Development,
and DPhil, Associate Tutor at the Department of IR, University of
Sussex, "The International Relations of Crisis and The Crisis of
International Relations: From the Securitisation of Scarcity to the
Militarisation of Society," Global Change, Peace & Security, Volume 23,
Issue 3, Taylor and Francis

Instead, [both realist and liberal orthodox IR approaches]{.underline}
focus on different aspects of interstate behaviour, conflictual and
cooperative respectively, but each [lack]{.underline}s [the capacity to
grasp that the unsustainable trajectory of state and inter-state
behaviour is only explicable in the context of a wider global system
concurrently over-exploiting the biophysical environment in which it is
embedded. They are]{.underline}, in other words, [unable to address the
relationship of the inter-state system itself to the biophysical
environment as a key analytical category for understanding the
acceleration of global crises]{.underline}. They simultaneously
therefore cannot recognise the embeddedness of the economy in society
and the concomitant politically-constituted nature of economics.84
Hence, [they neglect the profound irrationality of collective state
behaviour, which systematically erodes this relationship, **globalising
insecurity on a massive scale -- in the very process of seeking
security**]{.underline}.85 In Cox's words, [because positivist IR theory
'does not question the present order \[it instead\] has the effect of
legitimising and reifying it']{.underline}.86 [Orthodox [IR **sanitises
globally-destructive**]{.mark} **collective inter-state
[behaviour]{.mark}** as a normal function of instrumental reason -- thus
**[rationalising]{.mark}** what are clearly deeply irrational collective
human [actions that]{.mark} threaten to permanently erode state power
and security by **[destroy]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark} very [conditions
of]{.mark} human [existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, the
prevalence of orthodox IR as a body of disciplinary beliefs, norms and
prescriptions organically conjoined with actual policy-making in the
international system highlights the extent to which both realism and
liberalism are ideologically implicated in the acceleration of global
systemic crises.87

By the same token, [the [incapacity to]{.mark} recognise and critically
[interrogate how prevailing]{.mark} social, political and economic
[structures are driving]{.mark} global [crisis acceleration]{.mark} has
[led to]{.mark} the proliferation of [**symptom-led solutions** focused
on]{.mark} the **[expansion of]{.mark} state/regime
[military]{.mark}--political [power]{.mark}** [rather than]{.mark} any
attempt [to transform **root**]{.mark} **structural
[causes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.88 It is in this context that, [as the
prospects for **meaningful reform** through inter-state cooperation
appear increasingly **nullified** under the pressure of actors with a
vested interest in sustaining prevailing geopolitical and economic
structures, states have resorted progressively more to **militarised
responses** designed to protect the concurrent structure of the
international system from dangerous new threats. In effect, the
**[failure]{.mark} of orthodox approaches [to accurately
diagnose]{.mark} global [crises]{.mark}**, directly [accentuates a
tendency to **'securitise' them** -- and]{.mark} this, ironically,
[fuels]{.mark} the **proliferation of [violent conflict]{.mark}** and
**militarisation** responsible for magnified global
insecurity]{.underline}.

['Securitisation' refers to a **'speech act'** -- an act of labelling --
whereby political authorities identify particular issues or incidents as
an **existential threat** which, because of their extreme nature,
justify going beyond the normal security measures that are within the
rule of law]{.underline}. It thus legitimises resort to special
extra-legal powers. [By labelling issues a matter of 'security',
therefore, states are able to move them outside the remit of democratic
decision-making and into the realm of emergency powers, all in the name
of survival itself]{.underline}. Far from representing a mere aberration
from democratic state practice, this discloses a deeper 'dual' structure
of the state in its institutionalisation of the capacity to mobilise
extraordinary extra-legal military-- police measures in purported
response to an existential danger.89

[The problem in the context of global ecological, economic and energy
crises is that such levels of [emergency mobilisation]{.mark} and
militarisation [have **no positive impact**]{.mark} on the very global
crises generating 'new security challenges', and are thus **entirely
disproportionate**]{.underline}.90 [All that remains to examine is on
[the **'surface'**]{.mark} of the international system (geopolitical
competition, the balance of power, international regimes, globalisation
and so on), phenomena which [are **dislocated** from]{.mark} their
**[structural causes]{.mark}** by way of being [unable to
recognise]{.mark} the [biophysically-embedded]{.mark} and
[politically-constituted]{.mark} social [relations]{.mark} of which they
are comprised. [The consequence is]{.mark} that orthodox [IR has **no
means of responding**]{.mark} to global systemic crises other than to
reduce them to their symptoms]{.underline}.

Indeed, [orthodox IR theory has]{.underline} largely
[responded]{.underline} to global systemic crises not with new theory,
but [with the expanded application of existing theory to 'new security
challenges' such as **'low-intensity' intra-state conflicts**;
**inequality and poverty**; **environmental degradation**;
**international criminal activities** including **drugs** and **arms
trafficking**; **proliferation of weapons of mass destruction**; and
**international terrorism**]{.underline}.91 Although the majority of
such 'new security challenges' are non-military in origin -- whether
their referents are states or individuals -- the inadequacy of systemic
theoretical frameworks to diagnose them means they are primarily
examined through the lenses of military-political power.92 In other
words, the escalation of global ecological, energy and economic crises
is recognised not as evidence that [the current organisation of the
global political economy is **fundamentally unsustainable**, requiring
urgent transformation]{.underline}, but as vindicating the necessity for
states to radicalise the exertion of their military--political
capacities to maintain existing power structures, to keep the lid on.93
[Global [crises are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[viewed as]{.mark}
amplifying [factors that]{.mark} could mobilise the popular will in ways
that [challenge existing]{.mark} political and economic [structures,
which]{.mark} it is presumed]{.underline} (given that state power itself
is constituted by these structures) **[[deserve
protection]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This justifies the state's adoption
of extra-legal measures outside the normal sphere of democratic
politics. In the context of global crisis impacts, [this]{.mark}
counter-democratic trend-line can [result in a]{.mark} growing
[propensity to **problematise**]{.mark} **potentially [recalcitrant
populations -- rationalising violence]{.mark} toward them** [as]{.mark}
a **[control]{.mark} mechanism**.]{.underline}

3.2 From theory to policy

Consequently, for the most part, the policy implications of orthodox IR
approaches involve a redundant conceptualisation of global systemic
crises purely as potential 'threat-multipliers' of traditional security
issues such as 'political instability around the world, the collapse of
governments and the creation of terrorist safe havens'. Climate change
will serve to amplify the threat of international terrorism,
particularly in regions with large populations and scarce resources.94
The US Army, for instance, depicts climate change as a
'stress-multiplier' that will 'exacerbate tensions' and 'complicate
American foreign policy'; while the EU perceives it as a
'threat-multiplier which exacerbates existing trends, tensions and
instability'.95

In practice, this generates an excessive preoccupation not with the
causes of global crisis acceleration and how to ameliorate them through
structural transformation, but with their purportedly inevitable
impacts, and how to prepare for them by controlling problematic
populations. [[Paradoxically]{.mark}, this '[securitisation']{.mark} of
global crises does **not** render us safer. Instead, [by
necessitating]{.mark} more [violence, while inhibiting]{.mark}
preventive [action]{.mark}, it [guarantees]{.mark} **greater
[insecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, a recent US Department of
Defense report explores the future of international conflict up to 2050.
It warns of 'resource competition induced by growing populations and
expanding economies', particularly due to a projected 'youth bulge' in
the South, which 'will consume ever increasing amounts of food, water
and energy'. This will prompt a 'return to traditional security threats
posed by emerging near-peers as we compete globally for depleting
natural resources and overseas markets'. Finally, climate change will
'compound' these stressors by generating humanitarian crises, population
migrations and other complex emergencies.96 A similar study by the US
Joint Forces Command draws attention to the danger of global energy
depletion through to 2030. Warning of 'the dangerous vulnerabilities the
growing energy crisis presents', the report concludes that 'The
implications for future conflict are ominous.'97 Once again, the subject
turns to demographics: 'In total, the world will add approximately 60
million people each year and reach a total of 8 billion by the 2030s',
95 per cent accruing to developing countries, while populations in
developed countries slow or decline. 'Regions such as the Middle East
and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the youth bulge will reach over 50% of the
population, will possess fewer inhibitions about engaging in
conflict.'98 The assumption is that regions which happen to be both
energy-rich and Muslim-majority will also be sites of violent conflict
due to their rapidly growing populations.

A British Ministry of Defence report concurs with this assessment,
highlighting an inevitable 'youth bulge' by 2035, with some 87 per cent
of all people under the age of 25 inhabiting developing countries. In
particular, the Middle East population will increase by 132 per cent and
sub-Saharan Africa by 81 per cent. Growing resentment due to 'endemic
unemployment' will be channelled through 'political militancy, including
radical political Islam whose concept of Umma, the global Islamic
community, and resistance to capitalism may lie uneasily in an
international system based on nation-states and global market forces'.
More strangely, predicting an intensifying global divide between a
super-rich elite, the middle classes and an urban under-class, the
report warns: 'The world's middle classes might unite, using access to
knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational processes in
their own class interest.'99

3.3 Exclusionary logics of global crisis securitisation?

Thus, [the securitisation of global crisis]{.underline} leads not only
to the problematisation of particular religious and ethnic groups in
foreign regions of geopolitical interest, but potentially [extends this
problematisation to any social group which might challenge prevailing
global political economic structures across racial, national and class
lines]{.underline}. The previous examples illustrate how [securitisation
paradoxically generates insecurity by reifying a process of
militarisation against social groups]{.underline} that are constructed
as external to the prevailing geopolitical and economic order. In other
words, [the internal reductionism, fragmentation and
compartmentalisation that plagues orthodox theory and policy reproduces
precisely these characteristics by **externalising** global crises from
one another, externalising states from one another, externalising the
inter-state system from its biophysical environment, and externalising
new social groups as dangerous 'outsiders']{.underline}. Hence, a simple
discursive analysis of state militarisation and the construction of new
'outsider' identities is insufficient to understand the causal dynamics
driving the process of 'Otherisation'. As Doug Stokes points out, the
Western state preoccupation with the ongoing military struggle against
international terrorism reveals an underlying 'discursive complex',
where representations about terrorism and non-Western populations are
premised on 'the construction of stark boundaries' that 'operate to
exclude and include'. Yet these exclusionary discourses are 'intimately
bound up with political and economic processes', such as strategic
interests in proliferating military bases in the Middle East, economic
interests in control of oil, and the wider political goal of
'maintaining American hegemony' by dominating a resource-rich region
critical for global capitalism.100

But even this does not go far enough, for arguably the construction of
certain hegemonic discourses is mutually constituted by these
geopolitical, strategic and economic interests -- exclusionary
discourses are politically constituted. New conceptual developments in
genocide studies throw further light on this in terms of the concrete
socio-political dynamics of securitisation processes. It is now widely
recognised, for instance, that the distinguishing criterion of genocide
is not the pre-existence of primordial groups, one of which destroys the
other on the basis of a preeminence in bureaucratic military--political
power. Rather, genocide is the intentional attempt to destroy a
particular social group that has been socially constructed as
different.101 As Hinton observes, genocides precisely constitute a
process of 'othering' in which an imagined community becomes reshaped so
that previously 'included' groups become 'ideologically recast' and
dehumanised as threatening and dangerous outsiders, be it along ethnic,
religious, political or economic lines -- eventually legitimising their
annihilation.102

In other words, [genocidal violence is inherently rooted in a prior and
ongoing **ideological process**, whereby exclusionary group categories
are innovated, constructed and **'Otherised'** in accordance with a
specific socio-political programme. The very process of identifying and
classifying particular groups as outside the boundaries of an imagined
community of 'inclusion', justifying exculpatory violence toward them,
is itself a political act without which genocide would be
impossible]{.underline}.103 This recalls Lemkin's recognition that the
intention to destroy a group is integrally connected with a wider
socio-political project -- or colonial project -- designed to perpetuate
the political, economic, cultural and ideological relations of the
perpetrators in the place of that of the victims, by interrupting or
eradicating their means of social reproduction. Only by interrogating
the dynamic and origins of this programme to uncover the social
relations from which that programme derives can the emergence of
genocidal intent become explicable.104

Building on this insight, Semelin demonstrates that the process of
exclusionary social group construction invariably derives from political
processes emerging from deep-seated sociopolitical crises that undermine
the prevailing framework of civil order and social norms; and which can,
for one social group, be seemingly resolved by projecting anxieties onto
a new 'outsider' group deemed to be somehow responsible for crisis
conditions. It is in this context that various forms of mass violence,
which may or may not eventually culminate in actual genocide, can become
legitimised as contributing to the resolution of crises.105

This does not imply that the securitisation of global crises by Western
defence agencies is genocidal. Rather, the same essential dynamics of
social polarisation and exclusionary group identity formation evident in
genocides are highly relevant in understanding the radicalisation
processes behind mass violence. This highlights the fundamental
connection between social crisis, the breakdown of prevailing norms, the
formation of new exclusionary group identities, and the projection of
blame for crisis onto a newly constructed 'outsider' group vindicating
various forms of violence.

Conclusions

While recommendations [to shift our frame of orientation away from
conventional state-centrism toward a \'human security\'
approach]{.underline} are valid, this [cannot be achieved without
confronting the **deeper theoretical assumptions** underlying
conventional approaches to \'non-traditional\' security
issues]{.underline}.106 [[By **occluding**]{.mark} **the [structural
origin]{.mark}** and systemic dynamic of **global ecological, energy and
economic crises**, orthodox [approaches]{.mark} are **incapable** of
transforming them. Coupled with their **excessive state-centrism**, this
means they **[operate]{.mark} largely [at the level of \'surface\'
impacts]{.mark}** of global crises in terms of how they will affect
quite traditional security issues relative to sustaining state
integrity, such as international **terrorism**, **violent conflict** and
**population movements**. Global [crises]{.mark} end up
**[fuel]{.mark}ling the [projection of risk]{.mark}** [onto]{.mark}
social networks, [groups]{.mark} and countries that cross the
geopolitical fault-lines of these \'surface\' impacts - which happen to
intersect largely with Muslim communities]{.underline}. [Hence, regions
particularly vulnerable]{.underline} to climate change impacts,
containing large repositories of hydrocarbon energy resources, or
subject to demographic transformations in the context of rising
population pressures, [have become the focus of state security planning
in the context of counter-terrorism operations abroad]{.underline}.

[The intensifying problematisation and
[externalisation]{.mark}]{.underline} of Muslim-majority regions and
populations [by Western security agencies - [as a **discourse** -
is]{.mark} therefore not only **interwoven with growing state
perceptions of global crisis acceleration**, but [driven]{.mark}
ultimately [by]{.mark} an **epistemological [failure]{.mark}** [to
**interrogate**]{.mark} **the [systemic causes]{.mark}** of this
acceleration in collective state policies (which themselves occur in the
context of particular social, political and economic structures). This
expansion of militarisation is thus coeval with the subliminal normative
presumption that the social relations of the perpetrators, in this case
Western states, must be protected and perpetuated at any cost -
precisely because the efficacy of the prevailing geopolitical and
economic order is ideologically beyond question.]{.underline}

As much as this analysis highlights a direct link between global
systemic crises, social polarisation and state militarisation, it
fundamentally undermines the idea of a symbiotic link between natural
resources and conflict per se. Neither \'resource shortages\' nor
\'resource abundance\' (in ecological, energy, food and monetary terms)
necessitate conflict by themselves.

There are two key operative factors that determine whether either
condition could lead to conflict. The first is the extent to which
either condition can generate socio-political crises that challenge or
undermine the prevailing order. The second is the way in which
stakeholder actors choose to actually respond to the latter crises. To
understand these factors accurately requires close attention to the
political, economic and ideological strictures of resource exploitation,
consumption and distribution between different social groups and
classes. [Overlooking the systematic **causes** of social crisis leads
to a heightened tendency to problematise its **symptoms**]{.underline},
in the forms of challenges from particular social groups. [This can lead
to **externalisation** of those groups, and the **legitimisation of
violence** towards them]{.underline}.

[Ultimately, this systems approach to global crises strongly suggests
that **[conventional]{.mark} policy [\'reform\' is woefully
inadequate]{.mark}**. **Global [warming]{.mark}** [and **energy
depletion** are manifestations of]{.mark} a civilisation which is in
**[overshoot]{.mark}**. The [current]{.mark} scale and
[organisation]{.mark} of human activities [is **breaching the limits**
of]{.mark} the wider environmental and natural resource [systems **in
which**]{.mark} **industrial [civilisation is embedded]{.mark}**. This
breach is now increasingly [visible in]{.mark} the form of two
interlinked crises in [**global food production** and]{.mark} the
**global [financial system]{.mark}**. In short, industrial
[civilisation]{.mark} in its current form [is **unsustainable**. This
calls for]{.mark} a process of **[wholesale]{.mark} civilisational
[transition]{.mark}** to adapt to the inevitable arrival of the
post-carbon era through social, political and economic
transformation]{.underline}.

[[Yet]{.mark} conventional theoretical and [policy
approaches]{.mark}]{.underline} fail to (1) fully engage with the
gravity of research in the natural sciences and (2) translate the social
science implications of this research in terms of the embeddedness of
human social systems in natural systems. Hence,
[[lacking]{.underline}]{.mark} [capacity for **[epistemological
self-reflection]{.mark}** and [inhibit]{.mark}ing the [transformative
responses]{.mark} urgently required]{.underline}, they [**reify and
[normalise]{.mark} mass [violence]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} diverse
[\'Others\']{.mark}, **newly [constructed as]{.mark} traditional
security [threats]{.mark}** enormously amplified by global crises - a
process [that **guarantees**]{.mark} **the [intensification]{.mark} and
globalisation [of insecurity]{.mark}** [on the road to]{.mark}
ecological, energy and economic **[catastrophe]{.mark}**. Such an
outcome, of course, is **not inevitable**, but extensive [new]{.mark}
transdisciplinary [research]{.mark} in IR]{.underline} and the wider
social sciences - drawing on and integrating human and critical security
studies, political ecology, historical sociology and historical
materialism, while engaging directly with developments in the natural
sciences - [[is]{.mark} **urgently [required]{.mark}** [to
develop]{.mark} coherent conceptual [frameworks which]{.mark} could
**[inform]{.mark} more sober, [effective]{.mark}, and joined-up
[policy-making]{.mark}** on these issues]{.underline}.

Duffield's principal message here is clear and provocative: [Liberalism
proceeds on the basis that **'[Others' are the problem to be
solved]{.mark}**[. With politics]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore
[[becoming the **handmaiden of necessity**]{.underline}]{.mark}, mired
in the instrumental pursuit of power, [any form of political
[subjectivity]{.mark} that stands against]{.underline} the technical
recovery of the good [life [is]{.mark} **necessarily [rendered
dangerous]{.mark}** [for the **greater**]{.mark}]{.underline} social
**[[good]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This is significant. Since
[**de-politicization** is]{.underline} said [to occur when life is being
**primed for its own betterment**]{.underline} -- that is, within the
remit of humanitarian discourses and practices -- it is possible to
offer an alternative reflection on Agamben's bare life. Bare life for
Agamben is seen to be a product of the sovereign encounter. Life, in
other words, becomes bare since it is beyond the recourse of any legal
frameworks/obligations -- hence set outside ('abandoned' in Agamben's
terms) the juridical protections that normally guarantee the subject a
place in our moral and political universe of obligation. What Duffield
implicitly suggests, however, is that [the [bare life]{.mark} of the
biopolitical encounter [is the product]{.mark}]{.underline} of a
different logic. No longer banished from the realm, [[life]{.mark} is
[denied]{.mark} its [political quality as]{.mark} the **'[bare
essentials' for]{.mark} species [survival]{.mark}**]{.underline} take
precedence. [No longer]{.underline} then [made bare in order to be
rendered inactive]{.underline} to the society it endangers, [[life is
**stripped**]{.mark} **bare [of its]{.mark} pre-existing
[values]{.mark}** [on the basis that those]{.mark}]{.underline} precise
[qualities [impede]{.mark} its potential productive
[salvation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hence, while this [[life is]{.mark}
equally assumed to be **[without]{.mark} meaningful [political
quality]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- though in this instance because of
some dangerous lack of fulfilment -- [permitting the restitution in the
life of the body implies that exceptional politics are displaced by
the]{.underline} no less imperial and no less politically [charged bare
activity of **species survival**. Barely active life]{.underline}
accordingly [has not only become the privileged object of global
security governance. **[Global battle lines are]{.mark}**]{.underline}
effectively **[[drawn around]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[hollowed-out
form]{.mark} in order [to gain mastery over]{.mark}]{.underline}** the
productive spoils of **[[global existence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[The Liberal War]{.underline}** Thesis

[[Imposing liberalism]{.mark} has often come at a price. That price has
tended to be a continuous recourse to war]{.underline}. While the
[**militarism** associated with liberal internationalization has already
received scholarly attention]{.underline} (Howard, 2008), [Foucault was
concerned]{.underline} more with [the **continuation of war** once peace
has been declared]{.underline}.4 Denouncing the illusion that 'we are
living in a world in which order and peace have been restored'
([Foucault]{.underline}, 2003: 53), he [set out to [disrupt
the]{.mark}]{.underline} neat [[distinctions
between]{.mark}]{.underline} times of
**[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**/military exceptionalism
**[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** times of
**[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**/civic normality. [War]{.underline}
accordingly now [appears to condition the type of peace that
follows]{.underline}. None have been more ambitious in mapping out this
war--peace continuum than Michael Dillon & Julian Reid (2009). Their
'liberal war' thesis provides a provocative insight into the lethality
of making live. Liberalism today, they argue, is underwritten by the
unreserved righteousness of its mission. Hence, while there may still be
populations that exist beyond the liberal pale, it is now taken that
they should be included. [With 'liberal peace']{.underline} therefore
[predicated on the]{.underline} pacification/**[elimination
of]{.underline}** all forms of political [**difference** in order that
liberalism might meet its own moral and political objectives, **[the
more peace is commanded, the more war is declared]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in order [to achieve it: 'In proclaiming peace . . . liberals are
nonetheless committed also to making war.']{.underline} This is the
'martial face of liberal power' that, contrary to the familiar
narrative, is 'directly fuelled by the universal and pacific ambitions
for which liberalism is to be admired' (Dillon & Reid, 2009: 2).
[Liberalism thus stands accused]{.underline} here [of universalizing
war]{.underline} in its pursuit of peace:

> However much liberalism abjures war, indeed finds the instrumental use
> of war, especially, a scandal, [[war has **always
> been**]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[**instrumental to**
> **liberal**]{.underline}]{.mark} as to **[[geopolitical
> thinkers]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In that very attempt to
> instrumentalize, indeed universalize, [war in the pursuit of its own
> global project]{.underline} of emancipation, [the practice of liberal
> rule itself becomes profoundly shaped by war.]{.underline} However
> much it may proclaim liberal peace and freedom, its own allied
> commitment to war subverts the very peace and freedoms it proclaims
> (Dillon & Reid, 2009: 7).

While Dillon & Reid's thesis only makes veiled reference to the
ontotheological dimension, they are fully aware that its rule depends
upon a certain religiosity in the sense that [[war has]{.mark} now [been
turned into a veritable human crusade with only two possible outcomes:
'**endless war or the transformation** of other societies]{.mark} and
cultures into liberal societies and cultures']{.underline} (Dillon &
Reid, 2009: 5). Endless war is underwritten here by a new set of
problems. Unlike Clausewitzean confrontations, which at least provided
the strategic comforts of clear demarcations (them/us, war/peace,
citizen/­soldier, and so on), these [wars no longer benefit from the
possibility of]{.underline} scoring outright [victory]{.underline},
retreating, [or]{.underline} achieving a lasting negotiated
[peace]{.underline} by means of political compromise. Indeed, deprived
of the prospect of defining enmity in advance, [war itself becomes just
as complex, dynamic, adaptive and radically interconnected as the world
of which it is part.]{.underline} That is why 'any such **[[war to end
war becomes a war without end]{.underline}]{.mark}**. . . . [[The
project]{.mark} of removing war from]{.underline} the [life]{.underline}
of the species [[becomes]{.mark} a lethal]{.underline} and, in
principle, continuous and [unending process']{.underline} (Dillon &
Reid, 2009: 32). Duffield, building on from these concerns, takes this
unending scenario a stage further to suggest that since wars for
humanity are inextricably bound to the global life-chance divide, [it is
now possible to write of [a '**Global Civil War'**]{.mark} [into which
all life is]{.mark} openly [recruited]{.mark}:]{.underline}

> [Each crisis of global circulation]{.underline} . . . [marks out a
> terrain of global civil war]{.underline}, or rather a tableau of wars,
> which is fought on and between the modalities of life itself. . . .
> [What is at stake in this war is the West's ability to contain and
> manage international poverty while maintaining the ability of mass
> society to live and consume beyond its means]{.underline} (Duffield,
> 2008: 162).

Setting out civil war in these terms inevitably marks an important
departure. Not only does it illustrate how [liberalism gains its mastery
by posing fundamental questions of life and death]{.underline} -- that
is, who is to live and who can be killed -- disrupting the narrative
that ordinarily takes sovereignty to be the point of theoretical
departure, [civil [war]{.mark} now appears to be [driven by a **globally
ambitious biopolitical imperative**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see below).

[[Liberals]{.underline}]{.mark} have continuously made
[[reference]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[humanity]{.mark} in order [to
justify]{.mark} their use of [military force]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ignatieff, 2003). [War]{.underline}, if there is to be one, [must be
for the unification of the species]{.underline}. This humanitarian
caveat is by no means out of favour. More recently it underwrites the
strategic rethink in contemporary zones of occupation, which has become
biopolitical ('hearts and minds') in everything but name (Kilcullen,
2009; Smith, 2006). While criticisms of these strategies have tended to
focus on the naive dangers associated with liberal idealism (see Gray,
2008), insufficient attention has been paid to the contested nature of
all the tactics deployed in the will to govern illiberal populations.
[Foucault returns here with renewed vigour.]{.underline} He understood
that [**forms of [war have always been aligned with]{.mark} forms of
[life]{.mark}**. Liberal wars are no exception]{.underline}. Fought in
the name of endangered humanity, [humanity itself finds its most
meaningful expression through the battles waged in its
name:]{.underline}

> At this point [we can invert Clausewitz's proposition]{.underline} and
> say that **[[politics is]{.mark} the continuation of [war by other
> means]{.mark}]{.underline}**. . . . While it is true that [political
> power]{.underline} puts an end to war and establishes or attempts to
> establish the reign of peace in civil society, it certainly [does
> not]{.underline} do so in order to [suspend]{.underline} the effects
> of [power or to neutralize the disequilibrium revealed in the last
> battle of war]{.underline} (Foucault, 2003: 15).

[What]{.underline} in other words [occurs beneath the semblance of
peace]{.underline} is far from politically settled:

> political struggles, these clashes over and with power, these
> modifications of relations of force -- the shifting balances, the
> reversals -- in a political system, all these things must be
> interpreted as a continuation of war. And they are interpreted as so
> many episodes, fragmentations, and displacements of the war itself.
> [We are always writing the history of the same war, even when we are
> writing the history of peace and its institutions]{.underline}
> (Foucault, 2003: 15).

David Miliband (2009), without perhaps knowing the full political and
philosophical implications, appears to subscribe to the value of this
approach, albeit for an altogether more committed deployment:

> NATO was born in the shadow of the Cold War, but we have all had to
> change our thinking as our troops confront insurgents rather than
> military machines like our own. The mental models of 20th century mass
> warfare are not fit for 21st century counterinsurgency. That is why my
> argument today has been about the centrality of politics. People like
> quoting Clausewitz that warfare is the continuation of politics by
> other means. . . . We need politics to become the continuation of
> warfare by other means.

Miliband's 'Foucauldian moment' should not escape us. Inverting
Clausewitz on a planetary scale -- hence promoting the collapse of all
meaningful distinctions that once held together the fixed terms of
Newtonian space (i.e. inside/outside, friend/enemy, citizen/soldier,
war/peace, and so forth), he firmly locates the conflict among the world
of peoples. [With global war therefore appearing to be an internal state
of affairs, vanquishing enemies can no longer be sanctioned for the mere
defence of things. A new moment has arrived]{.underline}, in which [the
destiny of humanity]{.underline} as a whole [is being wagered on the
success of humanity's own political strategies]{.underline}. No
coincidence, then, that authors like David Kilcullen -- a key architect
in the formulation of counter-­ insurgency strategies in Iraq and
Afghanistan, argue for a global insurgency paradigm without too much
controversy. [Viewed from the perspective of [power]{.mark}, global
insurgency is after all nothing more than the advent of a global civil
war fought for the biopolitical spoils of life]{.underline}. Giving
primacy to counterinsurgency, [it [foregrounds]{.mark} the problem of
[populations so]{.mark} that questions of [security
governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e. population regulation) [[become
**central to**]{.mark} **the [war]{.mark} effort**]{.underline} (RAND,
2008). Placing the managed recovery of maladjusted life into the heart
of military strategies, it insists upon a joined-up response in which
sovereign/militaristic forms of ordering are matched by
biopolitical/developmental forms of progress (Bell & Evans,
forthcoming). [[Demanding]{.underline}]{.mark} in other words [[a
planetary outlook,]{.mark} it [collapses the local into the
global]{.mark}]{.underline} so that life's radical interconnectivity
implies that absolutely nothing can be left to chance. While liberals
have therefore been at pains to offer a more humane recovery to the
overt failures of military excess in current theatres of operation,
[warfare has not in any way been removed from the species. Instead,
humanized in the name of local sensitivities, doing what is necessary
out of global species necessity now implies that [war]{.mark}
effectively **[takes place by every means]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our
understanding of civil war is invariably recast.

4 The Presence/Absence of 'the West'

One of the other tensions in the book as a whole is whether 'the West'
is, as stated in the Introduction, 'ubiquitous', or in decline. This
raises [the question of the presence/absence of 'the West']{.underline},
a question which [ties methodology, epistemology, and ontology
together]{.underline}. For the chapters that adopt a linguistic,
discursive epistemology, [**'the West' is** always **constituted
through** discourse, **either** through **explicit articulations** of
'the West', **or** more **indirectly** through those **signs that are
thought to indicate 'the West'**, be that **'liberal democracy'** or
'human rights']{.underline}. Although this might sound pretty
straightforward, I think it is worthwhile to discuss in more detail what
such implicit-explicit criteria imply and what they say about the
ontological -- and empirical -- status of 'the West'. First, [it is
obvious that **[to hold 'the West' as present exclusively through an
explicit articulation]{.mark} of 'the West' [would limit]{.mark} the
[analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, [as Schlag notes,
**because 'the West' is absent from** the **NATO documents** she
studies, **one would conclude that NATO has no connection to 'the
West'**. Specific texts, here **[NATO]{.mark} documents, [need]{.mark}
therefore [to be situated within a broader field of texts and]{.mark}
political [practice]{.mark}**; but we also need to be open to the
possibility that **['secondary terms' are so established as
markers]{.mark}** of a sign or identity [that **they can be used to
identify an identity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This, for instance, is the
strategy adopted in the chapters by Hellmann, Herborth, and Weber.
Steele also takes this route arguing that the pictures of the burned
contractors at Fallujah questioned the 'American Self' and hence the
vitality of 'Western civilization'. Yet, there is also always an
instability in the ability of 'secondary terms' to define 'something'
and we need therefore, as noted earlier, to incorporate that instability
into our analysis. Thus, [I read Schlag's observation that [**'the West'
and NATO are synonyms** as the outcome of **constant discursive
performances**]{.mark} by political actors **[that seek to close the gap
between the two]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I wonder also if more could be
said about the closure of the distance between 'America' and 'Western
civilization' in Steele's analysis. While on the one hand, one must
define 'the West' through indirect discursive markers, one should also,
on the other hand, recognize that such a definition is more elusive than
one that relies upon explicit articulations.

That [this is **not just methodological nitpicking**]{.underline} is
illustrated by the fact that [the way in which an analysis adopts an
**implicit or explicit criterion of identification has implications**
for the conclusion about the presence/absence of 'the
West']{.underline}. Let us take here Jackson's conclusion that 'the
West' is receding from US vocabulary. Jackson offers strong textual
evidence for this shift, quoting for instance Bush's 2006
fifth-anniversary speech for September 11. The short passage Jackson
quotes contains no less than five times 'freedom' -- and once 'free
nations' -- which is the first among the 'commonalities' defined by
Hellmann as those which identify 'the West'. Thus, if an implicit
criterion is adopted, 'the West' looks less as if it were in decline
than as if it were morphing into a 'Western universal' discourse, an
option explicitly adopted by Steele. To reiterate: my point is not that
we should decide on either the explicit or the implicit criterion as
that which truly defines 'the West' -- it clearly can be said to be
present through both -- but that we might benefit from making the
criteria we adopt more visible. Only then could we interrogate why
implicit and explicit criteria might lead us to different conclusions
about the status of 'the West'.

### AT: Ukraine Proves

#### Ukraine doesn't "prove" anything in itself -- dominant meaning is yet to be constructed -- reading it through a lens of "revisionism" hardens identities and accelerates escalations of violence

[The persistence of [the **Western 'we'** has **spiraled** into]{.mark}
a [more and more]{.mark} homogenous and univocal public sphere and
**[academic concordance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The 'politics of
conflict and post-conflict management' increasingly rely on a
controversialization of claims to justice manifested inter alia in the
'emphasis on the study of the past from a plurality of
views']{.underline} (Klerides, 2014, p. 18). [This plurality is
partially and conveniently recruited only when the others' claims to
rights need to be relativized and the victim and wrong-doer
levelled]{.underline}.7 [The 'plurality of views' approach is activated
when the invading force is an ally and must be given 'voice'. When the
aggressor is an enemy, the switch from the 'plurality of views' approach
to that of 'fake news' and 'alternative facts' accusations is almost
instantaneous]{.underline}.

[The principled stance of [**condemning an invasion** should **not
preclude critique of all**]{.mark} **the involved or affected
[parties]{.mark}**, nor should it compel lack of nuance]{.underline}.
Nuance as such has most intricate political operations: either missing
or added it may controversialize something that should remain
uncontroversial or consolidate something that should be
controversialized. Consider such operations when revisionism is now
uncritically used in the current global, Western, political vocabulary.
[**[Revisionism]{.mark}**, a normatively neutral term, has, **[as an
explanatory frame for]{.mark} the invasion in [Ukraine]{.mark}**,
replaced the older explanatory and normatively loaded terms of
expansionism or imperialism. Quickly, uncritically and virally
dispersed, this euphemism [**obliterates all nuances necessary** for
**discerning** when]{.mark} the **[re-sketching]{.mark} of [maps is
justified by]{.mark} de-colonial [historical genealogy]{.mark}** and
irenic implementation of majority and self-determination principles [and
when it is]{.mark} an outcome of **expansionist
[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Adding these nuances, returning to
the principle that any attack on a state's sovereignty is imperialist no
matter what else it might be, also invites caution]{.underline}. [**In
[the effort to condemn]{.mark}** the clearly spelled-out state
expansionism, one **[may forget the gap between]{.mark} an aggressor
state's [government and]{.mark} the citizens or [culture]{.mark}** of
the state and hysterically incriminate the country as such rather than
the country's policy]{.underline}. The educated skill in international
politics that could mitigate such risks has been totally overlooked by
the education of our times and its theory.

Cyprus, Iraq, former Yugoslavia, etc., form a chain, and this 'etc'.
interestingly indicates an ominous continuity rather than cata-strophe
as future transformation and rupture with the past. In Ukraine's case
the chain seems broken; the Western world now feels free to use the word
'sovereignty' unreservedly, perhaps even uninhibitedly. After many years
of other invasions in various localities having failed to sensitize
educational theorists/philosophers concerning the dangers of
deconstructing (instead of complicating) national identity, the Western
world seems to be taking a U-turn. That is, [the 'we' of Western visions
of political configurations has also come full circle: from the
Westphalian roots of the state and the late-modern apotheosis of
sovereignty to the post-modern wholesale incrimination of the
nation-state and now to sovereignty being again in fashion]{.underline}.
Coming full circle concerning sovereignty could prove fruitful, since
there has been a surplus of normativity that theory obliterated in its
zeal to go post-national, though this should not be taken
unconditionally, simplistically and unreflectively.

[However, temporary awakenings after images of horror followed by a
merry slumber is not unusual]{.underline}, and I do not claim any
originality in registering this, since it has been recurrently
registered by many people in the margins of the world empire. Still, it
helps pose the question: [how much redirection, cata-strophe, may be
indicated in the new common cause of the West? The recent events in
**[Ukraine could initiate a re-thinking]{.mark}** that events such as
Iraq failed to mobilize, but I think it unlikely that]{.underline}
(post-, or post-post-)[theorists will make the connection]{.underline}.
If I may attempt some prediction, [the interest in an invaded country
and related territorial politics will remain emotivist, short-lived and
circumstantial, guided by official narratives, media coverage and
partial sympathies evoking Schmittean 'friend-enemy'
alliances]{.underline}. [The **global political support** may **expire
when the global balances of power will have surpassed the current
situation**]{.underline}. I will not be surprised if the Ukrainians will
be asked in the future to square the circle.

[**Also possible** is that the **global public concern for Ukraine will
last**]{.underline} until the next point of interest. And theory may
remember Ukraine only until the new post-post-post-ist project. In too
single-tasked a manner hegemonic theory has so far gone where the
current has drawn it: from the politics of difference to exclusive
emphases on inclusion and now to post-humanist, single-focused interest
in climate issues. Even when it turns multi-perspectival or
polyprismatic it does this just to acknowledge 'the plurality of voices'
and obtain from that acknowledgement the image of the democratic and
progressive. It misses the interconnectivity of the perspectives, their
synergies and tensions that reveal yet invisible or overlooked issues of
(in)justice.8 Ukraine could ruffle a few feathers since the detractors
of territoriality would now face the dilemma of either a politically
incorrect deconstruction of Ukraine or a deconstruction of their own
views -- if they are to have any minimal claim to consistency. A
scholarly world which has incriminated all national identifications;
based much of its self-understanding as postmodernist and
post-Westphalian on 'deconstructing' national sovereignty and patriotic
affect; and sleepwalked violations of international right and
disintegrations of the UN now faces this challenge: to deconstruct
Ukraine or to be deconstructed by it?

[The wave of **sympathy for Ukraine in the West**, the global love for
its people]{.underline}, conjures up the etymology of a pamphlet (pan +
philos, loved by all/loving all, https://www.etymonline.
com/word/pamphlet), which is obscured by the contemporary meaning of a
pamphlet as a short, polemical and partisan text on a contemporary
topic. The topic is not just popular (demo-philes); it is universally
loved (pan-philes). [**Ukraine** [may become the **metonymy** for the
**normative task to think critically about invasions**]{.mark} and
educate for this discursive justice too, a metonymic status that Iraq,
Cyprus, etc., never obtained in educational theory]{.underline}. To
become metonymic an event needs first to become pamphilic.9
[**[But]{.mark}**, for the metonymy [to have]{.mark} some **[lasting
consequence in global political imaginaries]{.mark}**, the pamphilic
positive political emotions for one victim must be turned into a
pamphilic concern for all victims, maintained consistently and
transferred to likely events, old or new. Beyond the emotivist,
universal reaction of sympathy and all that philia connotes, also
[important is]{.mark} the well-meant principled universalism that
enhances the public's or [**academia's** ability **to see the
connections among cases**]{.mark} and the interconnectivity of faces of
justice. Such enhanced (in)sight helps avoid double standards
[and]{.mark} allow the metonymy (e.g., Ukraine) to **[deconstruct
theoretical complacencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Care should be for
all, pan-philia shown not just for some. This universalism condemns
crimes of war wherever they come from; it condemns the acts, not the
people or the culture of a country. [It aims to a future of **global
friendliness** (pamphilikotis) **of states**, **against** ongoing uses
of 'friendly' as a **particularist** predicate of **some states**
(consider the term: friendly nations)]{.underline}.

[All these [require the turn of **the West**]{.mark} and its others
[toward]{.mark} some **[self-critique]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one as
radical as a cata-strophe, [that is still not in view and is highly
**unlikely**: so far, there are no signs that the numbed West has at
last realized what happened in Iraq and elsewhere and has not made the
connections between its own unilateral preemptive strikes on pretexts of
security and the use of the same rhetoric by an 'unfriendly' country
against a Western ally.]{.underline} Nevertheless, such a U-turn would
presuppose some sense of improvement (school improvement
notwithstanding), a notion that has its own political complicities. 'We
are stuck to the notion that we must improve ourselves, our society, our
world, and that education is the necessary path to this ever-receding
condition of fulfilment' (Peim & Stock, 2022, p. 259). However, can we
avoid the normativity of improvement, and at what cost? [The effort to
avoid biopolitics, Eurocentrism and toxic humanism has this risk: to
incriminate all improvement, and all educative moments]{.underline}.
Besides, not being stuck to the notion of improvement would logically be
an improvement too (an improvement from the condition of being stuck).10
In my opinion, [not being stuck to the hegemonic sense of improvement
does not mean to abandon the notion, but to loosen the hegemonic grip or
to show alternative meanings, namely, faces of the notion that the
dominant signification has kept from view]{.underline}. Then again, an
immediate objection would be that such nuances may condone education's
becoming a 'master concept' that reflects 'faith in the fallen present
order of things through its dual promises of individual and collective
fulfilment and redemption' (Peim and Stock, p. 256). Distinguishing
improvement qua adaptive 'learning' from the improvement that is deeply,
thoroughly critical, original and uncompromising, and loosening the
former's grip on today's world (if this could ever be attained),
promises some redemption. The distinction, just as all sanitizations of
tarnished terms, is untrustworthy. But the very expectation of
trustworthiness may itself be problematic, having its own risks.

One such risk is that dismissals of any future redemption may empower
retrotopias. 'The pendulums of the public mindset' are 'perform\[ing\] a
U-turn: from investing public hopes of improvement in the uncertain and
ever-too-obviously un-trustworthy future, to re-reinvesting them in the
vaguely remembered past' (Bauman, 2017, p. 6). The past is 'valued for
its assumed stability and so trustworthiness. With such a U-turn
happening, the future is transformed from the natural habitat of hopes
and rightful expectations into the site of nightmares' (Bauman, p. 6).
Certainly, not all blanket incriminations of normative notions (e.g.,
international law, or education/improvement in the case of Peim and
Stock's article) resort to retrotopias; in fact, some could also
vehemently attack retrotopics. Nevertheless, while portraying the future
as a site of nightmare and catastrophe (qua disaster) most accurately,
sweeping incriminations of normative terms (and of nuancing such terms),
ironically divest cata-strophe (qua radical change) of resources, at the
very moment that they extol radical transformation. For, the resources
of cata/strophes (disasters and promising changes) have always been
normativities, their ever renewed operations of nuancing and the utopics
to which wholesale incriminations deal a blow.

Peim and Stock theorize the prospect of catastrophe/disaster most
accurately. 'The instigation of the nuclear age marks a dramatic turn
whereby human technologies begin to immediately impact on the ecosystem
of the earth in an irreversible mode'. More inescapably than the steam
engine, 'nuclear arsenals become monstrosities that can destroy whole
worlds' (Peim & Stock, 2022, p. 253). Indeed, [with the events in
**Ukraine**, the world is witnessing another U-turn, that of the
possibility of a catastrophe more imminent than the ecological: the
nuclear. We are coming full circle on that too: nuclear arsenals
preoccupied the world in Cold War times]{.underline} (Russell,
1959/2009), [then they largely eclipsed from philosophy, educational
discourses and the public sphere. But, now, biological, chemical,
**[nuclear wars]{.mark}** and related laboratories [are **in full view
again**]{.mark}. This coming full circle is alarming as much as it is
illusive -- [illusive because **there was never a real break from
war**]{.mark} (certainly non-nuclear) and conflict, **[it was only
the]{.mark} big [Western places that enjoyed peace and wrongly projected
it on the whole world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nor did the world (Western
or other) and its theory prove pamphilic to cosmos (biota and
non-biota). In reality, the nuclear industry and the corresponding
science continued their 'progress' unabated.

While the theoretical world (Western and non-Western) overlooked the
continuation of nuclear production and related scientific research, a
disaster, which could at that stage be prevented through principled
action, was taking place. 'Ecological catastrophe signals an
unprecedented time of extreme crisis that involves changes to the
geological structure of the earth affected by nuclear tests that will
outlast any reasonable calculation of the lifespan of the human species'
(Peim & Stock, 2022, p. 257). Peim and Stock remark that 'conventional
wisdom' 'decrees education an essential force in saving the world'. They
pertinently disturb this wisdom by showing that 'education as we know it
must be seen as the most extensive expression of a dangerous biopower
that is beyond control',11 not only 'impotent in combating ecological
catastrophe', but also reproductive of the Anthropocene (p. 251).

Reflecting on the times, the time of education, and the complicities of
education, its theory and the whole human world in ecological and other
catastrophes, we may concur with Peim and Stock that 'there is no hiding
place from education. Temporally, education is characterized by its
ancient provenance beginning at the beginning of civilization itself'
and 'by its interminable projection into a future that is completely
unknowable' (Peim and Stock, p. 259). Yet, it is through education that
the authors and their readers are able to view education as they do.
This does not only affirm the authors' view of education as intractable,
all-encompassing and inescapable; it also shows that education has a
disclosing power, a possibility of cata-strophe, one that does not leave
education's own, hegemonic thinking habits unaffected. I have already
discussed some such habits concerning global justice, double standards
and unqualified incriminations of normativities. Peim and Stock aptly
critique another hegemonic habit that characterizes even post-humanist
educational thought.

They argue that 'educational studies and philosophy of education' fail
to recognize the 'contemporary condition of education' because of 'the
idealist split between the fallen, manifest form of education and the
supposedly unlocked potential it possesses' (Peim and Stock, p. 257).
This condition reflects 'the very forces that have driven modernity' and
effected 'the technological and social changes implicated in the great
transformation' that reproduces the Anthropocene (p. 258). I agree with
Peim and Stock's critique of our field, but not on the attributed
causality because it implicitly grants our field that, though it has
failed to critique education per se, it has critiqued the world and the
fallen, manifest form of education. I doubt that our critiques have been
sharp, thorough or genuine enough to unlock educational potentials for
changes in global ethico-politics. The 'We' that shapes the 'we' of our
field is too immersed in its world to turn verbal promises into
practices, let alone critique the world 'cata-strophically'. Moreover,
nothing secures that the educational potentials that could be unlocked
would be for the better. This assumption rests on a hasty
normativization of rethinking and of transforming. Even if theory and
education were to unleash their most transformative critical energies,
these would not necessarily be apposite or redemptive just because they
promise a transformation, especially if they are too
formalist/indeterminate concerning what transformation they speak for.
Nor is cata-strophe inherently normative; it is ethically neutral,
neither guaranteeing nor precluding the desirable and worthwhile
direction.

'Education is symptomatic of the end of the world as opposed to a tool
to combat it' (Peim and Stock, p. 252): what education? Education is a
functioning institution; a critical-normative term (an ideal at variance
with the institution); and a concept and phenomenon broader than the
institution. None of these is reducible to the other. A critique of them
should be nuanced to reflect this plurality and related
interconnectivity. Thus, I agree that 'education is not a pure and
redemptive concept that has been perverted into the form of the school'
(p. 256) and find it important for contesting popular binaries such as
'learning vs education' that glorify education. But I disagree with the
incrimination and identification of the concept of education with the
current education worldwide. Both sides essentialize education and
obfuscate its normative doubleness. Like many other human endeavours
education is encircled by catastrophe qua disaster and qua promising
change. Education as ideality involves cata/strophe, though not only in
the negative meaning that catastrophe has in the current Western
vocabulary and in Peim and Stock's paper. [The inauspicious record of
redemptive utopias which undermines their trustworthiness should not
lead to essentializing mistrust of the future and educational failures
to serve a better future]{.underline}.

'An object that inhabits spatio-temporalities like that of climate
change, whilst also feeding off and harvesting bodies through the mode
of biopower is one that we should be quick to challenge or combat' (Peim
and Stock, p. 261). A recurrent (crypto)normative task that Peim and
Stock set for the 'we' is 'to combat' education: a polemical term
evoking a battle, and battles sometimes effect a catastrephein
(destroying/destruction). This is a valuable contribution, especially
now, given the growing tendency in our field to go post-critical and
show love for the world, as if love were precluded by the critical. Peim
and Stock convincingly argue that, instead of combating, theory aspires
'to consistently ameliorate, build upon, and consequently grow the
hyperobject in question' (p. 261). They applaud efforts to 'step outside
of education and look to the broader ontologies of the world around
them' but what they call for 'is an interrogation of the object of
education itself, a vital endeavour to be acted upon before (perhaps
futile) attempts to move outside of it' (p. 257). To the doubt they
insert concerning feasibility I would add doubt about the normative
desirability of stepping outside of (a homogenized, non-nuanced)
education. To their call for combat I respond with cata-strophe.

'Disaster' carries normative implications because 'to call an event a
'disaster' is to signal that it is worthy of immediate, serious human
attention and purposive corrective activity' (Zack 2009, p. 7). But what
will count as 'corrective' reflects, in my view, dominant mindsets.
Catastrophe qua disaster is per se normatively unclear as to what
cata-strophe qua U-turn or radical change it may activate. The currently
popular educational-philosophical normativization of rupture and
transformation per se is just a postmodern wishful thinking. Taking
Ukraine as a metonymy for a possible (though actually unlikely) U-turn
of educational philosophy concerning global ethics/ politics, I have
wondered whether our field (or related fields) will be cata-strophic in
front of yet another catastrophe qua disaster. [[Will **academia think
Ukraine** through]{.mark} to theoretical and political implications for
currently **[hegemonic]{.mark}** and **globally disseminated**
[**discourses**?]{.mark}]{.underline} Will academia grasp education's
relevance to egregious injustices that remain invisible and outside of

**government authority** in]{.mark} general or for **[extraordinary
measures]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Sandin, 2018, p. 20). [Rather than

### AT: No Threat Inflation

#### [Yes threat inflation]{.underline} -- especially around [NATO]{.underline} -- confluence of [institutional]{.underline} and [social]{.underline} incentives makes it inescapable absent the ALT

**Friedman 20** Benjamin H. Friedman, adjunct lecturer at George
Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs, policy
director at Defense Priorities, former research fellow in defense and
homeland security studies at the CATO Institute, PhD candidate political
science, MIT, graduate of Dartmouth College, "Alarums and Excursions:
Explaining Threat Inflation in U.S. Foreign Policy," CATO Institute,

<https://www.cato.org/publications/alarums-excursions-explaining-threat-inflation-us-foreign-policy>
/GoGreen!

In Elizabethan theater, "alarums and excursions" was a stage direction
calling for actors to rush about the stage in a chaotic clamor
suggestive of battle.1 [In American politics, **[threat
inflation]{.mark}**]{.underline} has a similarly theatrical role: it
[tries to confuse and excite an audience to win its support for some
policy, often military excursions of some sort]{.underline}. This
chapter explains why [[**U.S. defense politics** is **especially prone**
to]{.mark} such behavior]{.underline}---why, that is, U.S. leaders
serially exaggerate the nation's vulnerability to national security
threats.

The explanation, in a nutshell, is that [[**power** gives]{.mark} the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [the [opportunity to
adopt]{.mark} expansive foreign policy goals]{.underline}.2 ["Expansive"
here refers not necessarily to attempts at expansion in the sense of
territorial acquisition but to [a **militarily**]{.mark} **active and
[interventionist grand strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[To **heighten
support**]{.mark} for those goals, U.S. [leaders **exaggerate their
contribution**]{.mark} to domestic security]{.underline}. Over time,
expansive foreign policy [also [generates **societal interests** tied to
its survival]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Those interests, most prominently
**national [security organizations]{.mark}**[, **inflate threats** to
**protect their prerogatives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Educated amid that
cacophony of threat inflation, new [**political leaders** learn to
echo]{.mark} it, either [because doing so seems **politically
safe**]{.mark} or because they believe it. [**Assertions of insecurity**
become a **cultural habit**]{.mark} of American elites]{.underline}.

The chapter begins by defining threat inflation and describing how U.S.
leaders use it. It then reviews political science and economics concepts
showing how special interest groups dominate debates about risk. The
second section shows how the growth of U.S. power distributes the costs
of expansive foreign policies, thus undermining the formation of
interest groups opposed to such policies. The next shows how power
concentrates the benefits of those policies, forming interests that
promote themselves with threat inflation. The last section discusses
conditions that make for more balanced debate about threats and how to
foster them.

In explaining U.S. threat inflation, the chapter sheds light on which
security threats are especially prone to exaggeration; on why reactions
to new threats are often slow; on why fears tend to outlast the dangers
that brought them; and, more generally, how debate fails to purge
myth---how the democratic marketplace of ideas fails.

Threat Inflation as Conflict Socialization

[**Threat inflation** is speech that gives an **exaggerated sense of
danger**. It need **not** involve **lying**]{.underline}. U.S. leaders,
for example, [[often]{.mark} **threat‐​inflate** [by abusing **worst‐​case
scenarios**]{.mark}---[highlighting]{.mark} a dangerous
**[possibility]{.mark}** and **[omitting]{.mark} its
[probability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 Shorn of context, the possibility
implies more danger than reality merits. If you tell someone skiing
bunny slopes in New Hampshire to beware of avalanches and illustrate the
danger with tales of heliskiers buried by snow in the Canadian Rockies,
you are not lying. But you have failed to point out that the danger of
an avalanche in the White Mountains is remote. You are inflating
skiing's danger. Of course, [in national security politics, exaggeration
is rarely so blatant. It can be **difficult to separate** the **prudent
warning** from **threat inflation**, **especially when the speaker's job
is to warn**]{.underline}.

In the Semi‐​Sovereign People, E. E. Schattschneider imagines democratic
politics as a street fight watched by a crowd.4 The fight's outcome, he
tells us, depends on the extent of the crowd's involvement. So the
brawlers may try to involve the crowd, depending on its disposition and
on how the fight is going. In politics, he argues, beneficiaries of the
policy status quo will seek to keep conflict narrow, whereas those
seeking change will often try to broaden it. Activists frustrated by
local politics might try to involve state government, and statewide
combatants may look to the federal government. The full Congress can
reverse its committees' actions. The secretary of defense might
reevaluate an army decision, and the president, driven by public
opinion, might overrule him.

[In U.S. politics, threat inflation is often a shout of "danger!" meant
to socialize conflict, an effort to energize public opinion. The U.S.
system]{.underline}, according to Theodore Lowi, [is especially prone to
such appeals]{.underline}. Compared with dictatorships or even
parliamentary governments, **[[power in the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[is
diffuse]{.mark}**: [spread among]{.mark} branches of government,
committees, agencies, and private interest groups]{.underline}.5 [Those
entities are potential **[points of resistance to policy
change]{.mark}**. They create a powerful bias toward the status
quo]{.underline}.

[Crises and wars unify public goals, overcoming the typical stasis.
[**Invocations of insecurity** attempt to]{.mark} create a similarly
**unifying sense of crisis** that **[remove]{.mark}s [parochial barriers
to]{.mark} collective action**]{.underline}.6 [**Because policymakers
always struggle to [implement]{.mark} their [proposals]{.mark}**,
**alarmism** is a **regular feature** of U.S. policy
debate]{.underline}. It rarely works. But as with most shouts for help,
the absence of initial success is likely to produce louder shouting, not
quiet. Threat inflators are searching for arguments that win with the
public.

[Another species of threat inflation defends the status quo.
[**Advocates** of **security organizations**]{.mark} and policies
naturally **[defend them by references to]{.mark} the [dangers that they
confront]{.mark}**. Such defenses **shade easily into exaggeration**,
especially as the relevant threat lessens]{.underline}.

Misperception vs. Dishonesty

[The considerable **[academic lit]{.mark}erature** dealing with **how
states misunderstand and mismanage danger** generally **[focuses
on]{.mark} errors of perception**---psychological **bias**,
**ignorance**, **intelligence mistakes**, and other communication and
comprehension problems that prevent the state from correctly
interpreting information]{.underline}.7 So the Nazi threat mounted
without a proper response because nations slept, blind to its menace.
The 9/11 attacks resulted from a "failure of imagination."8 The United
States invaded Iraq because it overestimated Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction arsenal. [The **solution** to **misperception** is
to]{.underline} see more clearly---[**correct for predictable biases**,
**collect better intelligence**, improve analysis of it, **share
information faster**, and **use better theory about enemy
thinking**]{.underline}.

The tendency to attribute security policy failure to misperception
follows what can be called the rational‐​comprehensive model of politics,
where government is seen as a process of revealing the national
interest.9 Intelligence and commission reports, congressional hearings,
and analysis from think tanks or academics inform policymakers'
perceptions. Those perceptions yield policy without too much trouble.

The rational‐​comprehensive model sees liberal democracy as a marketplace
of ideas that selects for truth and wise foreign policy and sees
misperception as a distorter of that market's prices.10 The separation
of powers and the need for public approval mean that policies will be
publicly debated. Debate will be wide because the public bears the cost
of policies and thus has an interest in truthful analysis of their
consequences. Contestation exposes the errors supporting policy options,
costing them support. Even the prospect of dissent can prevent leaders
from proposing actions detrimental to the national interest. Leaders
either learn directly from debate or adjust their preferences for
electoral reasons as the public debates its way toward wisdom. The
nation will not always avoid folly but will eventually recognize it and
self‐​correct. Liberal countries will adjust better than illiberal ones
to the international system's pressures and will adopt wiser foreign
policies.11 They should continually reevaluate their assessments of
threats and the efficacy of policy responses, adjusting programs and
spending accordingly.

Misperception is often a convincing tool for understanding failures in
security policy. [But there are several reasons to suspect that
political analysts overdiagnose it]{.underline}. [First, misperception
flatters social science. If flawed theoretical lenses cause leaders to
misperceive, analysts are optometrists. Their importance under this
approach probably makes them overly eager to use it]{.underline}.
[Second, **[perceptual explanations for policy failures invite
technocratic solutions]{.mark}**, which essentially say stick with
present policy goals while improving the means---tweaking the engine
rather than swapping cars or picking a new destination. **[Because
those]{.mark} fixes [threaten no important]{.mark} public
[organization]{.mark} or interest**, they are relatively uncontroversial
and **easy to implement, [mak]{.mark}ing [them especially
attractive]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **politically ambitious
[analysts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Third, misperception shucks aside
dishonesty. Children know that politics is dishonest, but international
relations scholarship pays little attention to it, probably because it
is hidden.12 Elected leaders avoid admitting that they often sacrifice
the general or national interest for narrower ones, even those they were
elected to represent. National security politics are particularly prone
to that problem. The supposed stakes make parochial considerations seem
particularly inappropriate, hence the myth that politics stops at the
water's edge.

Pluralism and Threat Perception

The theory elaborated here sees leaders' tendency to purposely mislead
the public as the main cause of national errors about threat. The theory
comes from pluralism, not the rational‐​comprehensive model.13 Pluralism
sees democratic government as an arena for the competition of interests
manifest in pressure groups, congressional committees, and government
agencies. In pluralism, sales and bargaining are the guts of democracy;
science is just the marketing language. That is because the legitimacy
that democratic rule gathers by process is never enough. Science's
sheen, the ritual consultation of expertise, expands policies' appeal.
White papers, intelligence reports, and other forms of expert analysis
are less for enlightenment than affirmation---to convince observers that
government serves their interests, rescuing it from the ward heeler, the
backroom plutocrats, and the like.14 Policies are solutions seeking
problems to solve.15 The rational‐​comprehensive model has the causal
arrow backward; estimates of danger are more servants of policy
preferences than their cause. Ideas' competition is less a marketplace
than a theater, where debate produces noise and passion but little
progress toward truth or agreement.16

The American government is supposed to avoid the problem of special
interests triumphing over the general interest. In Federalist 10, James
Madison argues that faction checks faction in large republics,
preventing narrow interests from dominating public policy.17 Madison's
essay reflects a classically liberal idea---one present in the checks
and balances in the Constitution---that competition among
self‐​interested actors serves the general interest.

David Truman and other early pluralists use similar logic to argue that
the U.S. government succeeds by inviting group competition.18 The
distribution of power in American government makes it uniquely open to
influence, encouraging the formation of political interest groups. Those
groups include not only economic interests such as industry associations
but also religious groups, civil rights organizations, conservationists,
and so forth. New groups organize to advance new goals or to defend old
ones against other interest groups. For example, public health advocacy
groups trying to ban smoking in bars may prompt bar owners to organize
against the ban.

Pluralists see the political interest groups as servants of various
societal goods or ends, which they embed in the aims of government
agencies. Policymaking is the competition of those goods. The government
as it stands---its budget and programs---is their compromise, though not
a static one. That outcome approximates the national interest better
than any alternative, though none of the competitors will ever be
satisfied.

In an optimistic reading of pluralism, interest‐​group competition
heightens appreciation of truth. If groups mislead the public, they are
likely to harm other groups' interests. Those groups will combat the
misinformation. For example, if the army exaggerates an enemy's
capability in order to win funds for more personnel, the air force may
correct the record for fear that the funds will come from its budget.
Export industries might downplay threats if responses to them threaten
market access. These fights spill into debates in the Congress or the
press, and observers learn what is accurate.

Mancur Olson's The Logic of Collective Action critiques the optimistic
kind of pluralism. Olson argues that many societal goods---those that he
calls public goods---lack interest‐​group protection and, therefore,
public policies that serve them.19 His argument implies that no one will
inflate threats to serve those goods or to combat threat inflation that
harms them.

Public goods have two characteristics, Olson says. No one can be
effectively excluded from enjoying the good (nonexcludability), and one
person's consumption of the good does not reduce availability of the
good for consumption by others (nonrivalry). Those characteristics
encourage people to free-ride---to try to enjoy the good without
contributing to its provision. As a result, people lack incentive to
provide public goods. That is the collective action or free‐​rider
problem. Small groups overcome the free‐​rider problem by enforcing
participation and providing benefits for participation (select benefits)
to members.

Pecuniary motives are not the sole cause of people's preferences about
politics or engagement in it, of course. People often damage their
material well‐​being in service of social, familial, moral, or religious
ends. But the fact that some people's behavior does not reliably follow
from material incentives does not mean that they do not create general
tendencies that powerfully affect politics. Collective action theory
suggests that without the aid of private interests, public goods will be
underprovided, whatever the efforts of do‐​gooders. Moreover, even if
one's goals derive from moral considerations, free riding impedes
organization.

Government overcomes collective action problems by coercion--- forcing
people to fund public goods via taxation. But without private interests
pushing it in the first place, why will government provide the good?
Collective action theory says policy in any given area will serve
private interests, not the national interest.

Pure public goods are rare. In most cases, government provision of a
good via policy creates classes of beneficiaries.20 A policy's costs and
benefits distribute unevenly and, therefore, so do incentives to try to
implement or change it. That insight points to a more realistic way of
considering political organization: transaction costs. That term means
the cost of engaging in economic exchange, excluding the good's price.
Transaction costs include the effort required to make a deal and gather
the information needed to determine whether it is worthwhile.

In public policy terms, the transaction costs that a person would expend
to learn his or her interests generally outweigh the benefits gained
from doing so. If you do not pay the information cost of learning your
interest, you cannot know that for sure, of course. But people will have
a general sense that in most policy areas, their efforts are unlikely to
pay off. They remain rationally ignorant. Only people who receive
relatively high returns from the good have incentive to learn their
interests, let alone organize others in service of them.

Policy outcomes, then, depend less on a policy's total costs and
benefits for society than on the intensity and distribution of interests
that the policy creates. Minorities with concentrated interests rule
over disinterested majorities.21 Those groups---concentrated or special
interests--- will likely dictate policy if it causes no one losses of
similar magnitude. Though transaction costs are an economic concept,
their relevance extends to immaterial interests and groups formed to
advance them. What facilitates organization is not the nature or origin
of preferences but their distribution. The few whose moral or religious
fervor makes them care deeply about a policy area exercise outsize
influence over it. Cuban exiles dominate U.S. policy toward Cuba just as
the farm lobby dominates agricultural policy.

Transaction costs explain how narrow interests dominate not only policy
but also ideas about policy. Politics are rife with what economists call
information asymmetry---where one party to a potential exchange holds
most of the information about the value of a good being sold.22 Because
people lack incentive to pay the cost of figuring out what a good is
worth to them, they use proxies to guide their political preferences.23
Those that stand to benefit more directly will gather the relevant
information, employ experts, and try to convince a larger and more
uncertain group that the good is valuable enough to justify their
action---organization, contributions, or votes. For example, interest
groups such as the Chamber of Commerce will struggle to convince
would‐​be members that their contribution buys them something worthwhile.
Ideas about politics, including what constitutes a threat, are largely
the byproduct of the formation and conflict of organized political
interests.24 Voting for a party or candidate is deciding whose story
about your best interest to believe.

That logic extends to ideologies, which are informal normative
frameworks.25 Ideology is considered here to be a species of
institution, which means rules and norms governing human behavior.26
Ideologies allow people to generate many preferences from a few beliefs.
The belief that you are a conservative, for example, yields a plethora
of beliefs about how society ought to be constituted. Ideology thus
lowers both the cost of policy preferences and the cost of translating
them into action. Leaders use ideology to convince the public to support
particular policies.

Once a policy's cost becomes high enough, those paying have incentive to
inform themselves, reducing asymmetry and the potential for
manipulation. For example, those likely to be drafted into Vietnam and
killed became more informed about the war and more likely to oppose
it.27 Where information is cheaper, more individuals have incentive to
gather it and discern their interests more carefully.

This analysis of [**[transaction costs]{.mark}** has three implications
about threat perception and national reaction to threats]{.underline}
worth highlighting. [First, [because **learning about security is
expensive**]{.mark}, national security [is especially prone to
**information asymmetry** and thus to **threat
inflation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Few entities can afford the
surveillance assets needed to know the disposition of foreign
missiles]{.underline}. It is hard to learn what terrorists in Waziristan
are doing, even if you live there. [As a result, information about
threats comes mostly from government or analysts tied to
it]{.underline}.28 [**Threats are ambiguous**, and the logic of policies
meant to mitigate them is often complex]{.underline}. [Providers of
security play a particularly dominant role in the formation of public
ideas about it]{.underline}.

[Second, the distribution of societal interests implicated by responses
to the danger---the domestic economy of incentives---drives national
reactions to danger. If responding to a threat creates concentrated
benefits and diffuse costs, government will likely adopt expensive and
aggressive policies to combat it. Threats that encourage policies
creating concentrated costs and diffuse benefits may provoke little
response. Policies that concentrate costs and benefits will create
controversy and a balanced response to threats. If responding to a
threat concentrates no interest, we should expect an indifferent policy
response]{.underline}.

Third, national threat perception will be slow to respond to changes in
threat. Interests tied to a threat will not disappear with it. They will
continue to promote it or the similar threats that they combat.29 In
fact, by endangering those interests, the threat's disappearance may
even increase their output of hype.

Unrestrained Power Causes Threat Inflation

Expansive defense policies and perception of threats that justify them
serve the national security establishment but harm the American public
slightly. Threat inflation is one tool that the establishment uses to
convince the public otherwise. Because expansive policies' costs
distribute to everyone as deficits or taxes, few people have an
incentive to organize against them and convince the public of its true
interests.

Arnold Wolfers argues that the term "national security" tends to cloak
other interests:

A glance at history will suffice to show that survival has only
exceptionally been at stake, particularly for major powers. If nations
were not concerned with the protection of values other than their
survival as independent states, most of them, most of the time, would
not have had to be seriously worried about their security, despite what
manipulators of public opinion engaged in mustering greater security
efforts may have said to the contrary.30

Wolfers says that we give rhetoric too much due in considering the
sources of foreign policy. States want safety, but they also seek
status, material gain, and ideological goods. Some states, he says,
value such goals more than security.31 To maximize support, they always
talk about their goals in relation to security, however, obscuring the
distinction between needs and wants.

The modern United States is Wolfers's poster child. National survival is
virtually ensured by geography, tradition, nuclear weapons, and the
wealth and technology that generate military power. For most Americans,
unsuccessful wars, even the recent one in Iraq, result in little more
than marginally higher tax rates or debt. Since the draft's end, war
kills only the volunteer military and foreigners. Contrast that with
Europeans living 100 years ago or the Athenians portrayed by Thucydides,
where foreign policy failures meant conquest and mass death, and even
successful wars would kill many sons and consume a considerable portion
of societal wealth. U.S. foreign policy, no matter how misguided, rarely
endangers safety at home.32

But nothing sells foreign policy in public like danger. To increase
public support for an interventionist foreign policy, leaders portray it
as a means to lessen threats. That portrayal requires threat inflation.
There is a paradox: security increases the sense of insecurity.33 In
economic terms, the costs of expansive U.S. foreign policies might badly
outweigh the benefits, but costs are diffuse. The United States makes
foreign policy like rich people shop: indulging luxurious tastes without
much concern about price.

That argument is broadly consistent with realism. Realism concerns the
systematic interaction of power. It sees rival power, or appreciation of
its possibility, as the source of restraint in domestic and
international politics. Power checks power. We can preach
self‐​restraint, but preaching rarely restrains when opportunities for
indulgence arise.

Realism is sometimes seen as the absence of folly, as clear‐​eyed
pragmatism. But that view is realpolitik---the behavior the
international system encourages, according to Kenneth Waltz.34 His
theory, structural realism, considers states to be like units in anarchy
seeking survival with varying capability. The system created by the
interaction of those units is competitive. Competition encourages states
to protect their power through realpolitik. One such behavior is to
balance each other's power. Another is to appreciate the limits of
power, the danger of provoking rivals. International politics thus
generally encourages restraint in territorial acquisition, troop
deployment, and war making.

Structural realism should not be confused with the unconditional
prediction that states adopt realpolitik---pragmatic, restrained
policies.35 The theory says that international relations generally
create pressures against military adventurism, but not always. Systemic
pressures vary with time, geography, and relative capabilities. When
threats are remote and relative resources great, structural realism
suggests that foreign policy contrary to realpolitik is more likely.36
Another way to put it is that states, like people, are more likely to
act according to moral values when the price of doing so is low.37

Systemic pressures were strong in European states a century ago. They
have long been weak in the United States. They are nearly absent today.
As a result, the United States has embraced realpolitik only
intermittently, when threats loomed, and has traditionally indulged an
expansive foreign policy. Realists today typically argue that the
international system will teach the United States restraint, sooner or
later. But structural realism can accommodate the idea that the system
is the problem, not the solution.

The absence of international constraint is an open door. Relative power
and safety offer an opportunity for an expansive foreign policy. Whether
or not the state walks through depends on its internal
characteristics.38 But a history of being unrestrained internationally
will affect characteristics in consequential ways. The education offered
by international politics needs to become institutionalized to guide
state policy. So it will be slow to take even once conditions encourage
it, and it will outlast the dangers that brought it. What matters in
producing threat inflation is not simply the absence of restraint
because of relative power, but the history of being unrestrained and
safe.

Institutions explain why not all states, having the same power as the
United States does, would do as it does.39 For historical reasons, a
state with similar relative power and safety might have more doubt about
whether it can be a global force for good. Having been
institutionalized, those beliefs resist changes in international
conditions, changing only gradually or because of shocking events. For
example, experience renovated German and Japanese ideas about foreign
policy, replacing militarism with reluctance to use force. Laws and
traditions limit the size and influence of those nations' military
establishments, which were once powerful supporters of expansive foreign
policy.40 The two world wars left even their European victors chary of
policies that risk war, at least more chary than the United States,
where those wars were less painful.

As discussed earlier, ideologies organize social action. Those with the
most at stake---those that stand to receive concentrated material or
moral benefits---will tend to dominate ideological debate. But, as
social constructs, ideologies are broadly disputed, making consensus
hard to achieve. Overly abrupt proposed changes in ideological content
will be rejected by other ideological leaders and thus will convince
few. Over time, however, ideologies should shift to match the interests
of intellectual and political elites.

We can analyze the evolution of American ideas about foreign policy this
way. By generating new interests in expansionist foreign policy, as will
be discussed, and by lessening and distributing the costs of such
policy, growth in relative power helped change ideas. The United States
was generally isolationist in its first century of independence because
it had little capability to participate in global power politics and
wanted to be unmolested by other powers. There was no American empire to
promote, and there were European empires to keep out. An army was
occasionally raised and a navy kept to that end, but they needed an
anti‐​imperial ideology for support. The absence of a permanent military
establishment limited support for more expansionist takes on liberal
ideology.41 The liberal tradition confused and retarded the embrace of
expansion but did not prevent it.

Opportunity and experience were the key causes of the American shift to
expansive military policies in the 20th century, particularly after
World War II.42 Europe wanted American support against communism,
allowing the assertion of American power there. U.S. leaders justified
the new expansionist policies by disparaging isolationism and conflating
the spread of liberalism with U.S. security.43 Soviet power prevented

U.S. military intervention in some areas, like Eastern Europe and (along
with China) discouraged escalation of the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The
tragic results of Vietnam tempered U.S. enthusiasm for military
intervention for the rest of the Cold War. But the Soviet Union did
little to prevent interventions in most of the Third World. And
communism's threat encouraged some states to invite U.S. defenses,
encouraging interventions. The Soviet Union's collapse left the United
States even less restrained. The Gulf War and the perceived success of
the Cold War served the story that advocates of expansive foreign policy
told. Those events helped overcome the lingering popularity of
insularity. Government support for realpolitik ideas diminished after
the Cold War, and foreign policy idealism flourished.

[In the course of U.S. history, Americans went from considering
liberalism a fragile thing protected at home by isolation to something
protected abroad by troops or delivered there by wars of liberation or
state repair. That ideological shift produced more threat
inflation]{.underline}. It did so [because leaders motivated by
ideological ends always avail themselves of arguments about the security
benefits of their proposed action]{.underline}. [There is a **feedback
mechanism** here]{.underline}. [As a result of being unrestrained and
rich, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, in the course of its
history, [became more active abroad]{.underline}. [To promote activist
policies, leaders hyped threats and made ideological
arguments]{.underline}. [Over time, others, including new leaders, came
to support those policies because they had learned the ideology,
generating more threat inflation]{.underline}.44

Who Hypes What and Why

The United States is likely to adopt foreign policies contrary to its
interests if the costs of the policy are diffuse and the benefits are
concentrated. The theory discussed in this section can be thought of as
the benefit side of that equation. To summarize: expansive defense
policies and perception of threats that justify them harm the American
public slightly but help the national security establishment.45 The
establishment inflates threats to try to convince the public
otherwise---that policies conductive to various parochial interests
serve the public interest. Because expansive policies' costs sparsely
distribute to everyone as deficits or taxes, few people have an
incentive to organize and resist the establishment's take on threats. An
exception is military service members, who bear great cost in the event
of war. But professional norms discourage service members from taking
vocal anti‐​war stances. So the establishment dominates the creation and
interpretation of information about threats. Because the establishment
formed in the past and changes with difficulty, it tends to focus on
past threats, or threats like them, thus hindering the nation's ability
to react to new types of threats. The president generally compromises
with the establishment because of its information advantage and the
limited power and time he has to combat it. To sell that compromise, the
president echoes the establishment's threat inflation.

The rest of this section discusses why [specific elements of the
national security establishment hype threats and encourage the president
to do so]{.underline}. The entities discussed [include the so‐​called
iron triangle---military services, congressional committees, and defense
contractors---and intelligence agencies, nongovernmental veterans and
military organizations, think tank and academic defense analysts,
foreign governments, and the media]{.underline}. Before examining the
incentives that influence those groups, a caveat is needed. [The claim
here is [**not** that people are **simply products of their
organizational or personal interests**]{.mark}, that fidelity to such
incentives is an inviolate law of human behavior. **People often serve
the national interest at the expense of their own**. Working in
government can be an example. **[But though people often resist those
incentives, they]{.mark} push, pull, and [create general
tendencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The national security establishment is neither a unified entity nor a
conspiracy. Its parts have various goals that lead them to compete and
promote different dangers. But their interests in exaggerating threats
often overlap.46 Les Aspin explained that confluence well:

[The ends of MIC Inc. \[the military‐​industrial complex\] are achieved
through 1,001 individual and basically unrelated decisions, which taken
together have the effect of a conspiracy without there ever being
one]{.underline}. The [decisions are taken not only by the services and
their contractors, but also by labor unions, local politicians, and a
press inflicted with community boosterism]{.underline}. These factotums,
who might otherwise be brawling with one and other, rarely link arms in
pursuit of the ends of the MIC, but the decisions they take in pursuit
of their perceived self‐​interest have the same result. On the other
side, [there is no other side. The power of a labor union or of a big
business is circumscribed by the fact that there are opposite (if not
equal) pressures working against it. But the MIC has long functioned in
an atmosphere of at best inchoate countervailing
pressures]{.underline}.47

Congress and the executive branch share power over defense and foreign
policy. The executive, however, has become dominant since the start of
the Cold War, thanks largely to congressional acquiescence.48 The
executive drives national threat perceptions, though Congress plays a
key role under certain circumstances. Within the executive branch, the
White House directs security policy, but the president and his staff
have limited time and political capital. The real executers of defense
policy are the national security agencies, especially the military
services.

National Security Agencies

[**Organizational theory** helps us understand why **[security agencies
inflate threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Successful agencies mature [[by
**responding to their political environment**]{.underline}]{.mark},
particularly early formative experiences.49 [They ensure political and
budgetary support by reliably producing whatever outputs they were
created to deliver. They motivate employees through promotional tracks
and harmonize their actions with common training and standard operating
procedures]{.underline}. They maximize autonomy, avoiding reliance on
other agencies that might disrupt their ability to achieve their goal.
Those adaptations yield a fixed way of doing business or doctrine.50
Doctrine typically consists of various related tasks carried out by
specialized personnel, meaning that it requires a division of labor.
Divisions of labor are especially important in military organizations
because of the complex nature of their work. Those performing the most
essential jobs rise to dominate the management structure. Hence, a
hierarchy forms around a doctrine. Its maintenance protects the
organization's purpose.51 The organization teaches employees the
doctrine's worth, making it a culture, an ethos, or a mission.

[**Security agencies inflate threats** [to preserve **public and
budgetary support**]{.mark} for their mission]{.underline}. [Tied by
incentive structures to their purpose, organizations pursue it at the
expense of economy or truth. It is not that those considerations are
ignored, just that they matter less than organizational health, which
depends on outside support for its missions]{.underline}. [When their
preferred threats fade, security organizations will search for new
enemies to justify their services. The better the threat fits their
doctrine, the more they hype it]{.underline}.

The tendency to promote threats to protect missions is strongest in
large and unified organizations such as the U.S. Air Force. The tendency
is weaker in smaller and less focused organizations. Fewer resources
mean less ability to influence opinion directly and fewer dependents in
Congress and industry that share the organization's view. A divided
sense of mission means less incentive to sell a particular threat. For
example, the U.S. Coast Guard might hesitate to sell the terrorist
threat should counterterrorism force it to shift focus from harbor
patrol, one of its traditional missions.

Dedication to purpose makes bureaucratized agencies reliable servants of
their goal, but it limits organizations' ability to respond to new
conditions. A new mission would require a new division of labor,
resulting in a new hierarchy. Leaders are unlikely to cast themselves
and their protégés aside, especially when the current mission has
reliably brought outside support, including funding. So government
organizations tend to embrace only change that is consistent with their
doctrine.52 In national security, that tendency means that organizations
will be slow to adapt to the new types of threats. The U.S. Army
struggles with counterinsurgency. The Drug Enforcement Agency exists
because the Federal Bureau of Investigation was reluctant to chase drug
criminals. Agencies will not hype threats that seem to require doctrinal
innovation.

[Organizations promote threats via congressional testimony, reports,
leaks, press conferences and releases, [and]{.mark} **sponsored
research**, as well as by **feeding information to congressional
allies**]{.underline}. [As autonomy seekers, security agencies prefer to
monopolize intelligence assessments about threats that concern them.
Where that monopoly is impossible, they use their own intelligence units
to inflate their favored threats [to **compete with other
agencies**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Independent intelligence agencies such as the Central Intelligence
Agency will likely provide more accurate assessments than will military
intelligence agencies. Because providing accurate intelligence is the
CIA's mission, it has a greater incentive to assess correctly.53 It
checks the military services' ability to use their intelligence agencies
to hype threats. But, for three reasons, independent intelligence
agencies bend their analysis toward that of the organizations most
relevant to the threats being assessed. First, military intelligence
agencies may convince them. Second, the independent intelligence agency
may compromise to avoid being out on a political limb. Third,
intelligence agencies serve presidents, who are themselves influenced by
military preferences about dangers, as discussed later.54

Prestige and secrecy aid military threat inflation. Prestige stems from
the rarity of military expertise and the self‐​sacrifice that service
members risk. Prestige makes it harder to challenge military
assessments, particularly where other military authorities do not
contradict them. Secrecy often shields official claims about danger from
scrutiny.

Congress

Congress has the power to challenge executive branch takes on threats
but generally lacks an interest in using it. Constitutional powers to
legislate, enact agency budgets, and---in the Senate's case---approve
agency heads give legislators leverage over executive agencies. That
leverage can encourage agencies to echo congressional views on dangers
or to resist publicizing threat assessments likely to offend their
congressional sponsors. Legislators can also directly promote their take
on threats. Though congressional committees lack the staff and expertise
to evaluate many threats, they can pick their spots. They can produce
committee reports, fund outside experts to produce analysis, or request
reports from the Government Accountability Office or Congressional
Budget Office. They can hold hearings where experts testify about
threats. Committee hearings and reports, especially full committees, can
generate substantial media coverage.

Congressional power over defense policy is held largely by congressional
committees eager to fund the agencies they oversee. Defense
authorization and especially appropriations committees function
basically as real estate committees that are interested mainly in
extracting federal funds for local defense contracts and bases.55
Members typically join defense committees because of a local base or
defense production facility, and reliably promote and echo dire
assessments that encourage defense spending benefiting that local
interest. Where they challenge executive branch assessments, it is
usually because they are not sufficiently dire.

Members of congressional defense committees fight mainly about where to
locate military bases or produce military goods. But because most
locations are settled and the committees must produce an annual
compromise among regions in the form of a budget bill, comity
prevails.56 Members rarely attack the basis for others' funds by
undermining the threat claims that justify it. That live‐​and‐​let‐​live
ethos thrives particularly when defense spending is rising. Budget
growth dulls distributional conflicts. Declining budgets force choice,
and members then become more likely to attack one another's arguments,
including their portrayal of threats. But norms of accommodation
persist, and budgets generally rise.

The Defense Industry

[The defense industry does little itself to promote security threats but
encourages others to do so]{.underline}. [Contractors are too obviously
biased to make compelling Cassandras]{.underline}. Their public
communications, therefore, tend to include only vague messages about
their weapons' usefulness and economic benefits. Moreover, their
expertise lies in moving the government, not the public.57 They mostly
leave detailed talk about danger to military personnel, politicians, and
the experts that they fund.

[Contractors influence Congress---and to a lesser extent the military
services---in three ways. First, they **[sponsor studies by nominally
independent analysts]{.mark}**. Second, they lobby and make campaign
contributions to win congressional support for their work. Members of
Congress who receive those funds are more likely to aid contractors and
promote threats to justify it. But campaign finance influences lawmakers
far less than local jobs, the third source of contractor
influence]{.underline}.58 During the Cold War, the distribution of
military bases and production contracts, especially those to the
burgeoning aerospace industry, gave more U.S. regions and their elected
representatives a stake in high defense spending.59 By distributing
production facilities and subcontracts, the defense industry encourages
politicians to justify their constituency's spoils with threat
inflation. Note, however, that the members themselves press for those
jobs, making contractors less the driver of political outcomes than
their servant.

Nongovernmental Organizations

Various support communities echo the military services' take on
threats.60 Veterans' organizations and service support organizations,
such as the Air Force Association and Navy League, are composed of
people who personally identify with a service. They reflect
organizational talking points. The public presence of veterans' networks
in most communities reminds Americans that there are always enemies to
defend against.61

[The defense establishment's need for friendly expertise during the Cold
War aided the growth of **defense analysis [in think tanks]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}, to a lesser extent, among **[academics]{.mark}**.
Scholars' nominal independence and appeal to **scientific expertise**
provide an **aura of credibility**. **Defense analysts [reflect the
interests and threat assessments of the]{.mark} national [security
establishment]{.mark}**, or a portion of it, [for]{.mark} three
reasons.]{.underline}

[The first is **[inclination]{.mark}**. People who seek careers studying
weapons and militaries are more likely than is the general population to
believe in the efficacy of using them and thus are more likely to see
threats that need defending against]{.underline}. That is typical.
Scholars of international development tend to believe in foreign aid.
Environmental analysts are usually environmentalists.

[The second source of analyst bias is **[funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Some nominally independent experts moonlight as paid consultants for
defense contractors [or]{.mark} investment firms]{.underline}. [Others
hope to do so and thus avoid saying things that are likely to offend
**[future employers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many think tanks also rely
on Pentagon contracts or congressional allocations for budgetary
support. Analysts receiving such funding tend to answer only the
questions their sponsors ask and to avoid saying anything that is liable
to offend sponsors, including future ones.

[Third, careerism encourages think tank analysts to reflect the national
security establishment's threat inflation. Many hope to work in future
administrations and thus reliably reflect the threat assessments of one
party's elite. Because both parties typically inflate threats, so do
ambitious analysts]{.underline}. Because they are uncertain about
patrons' future ends and might want to find others, they are cautious in
their deviations from mainstream views about security issues. Even
analysts uninterested in entering government need a sense of danger to
be relevant. They are in the national security business too. Without
threats, they will have fewer chances to testify before Congress, fewer
media invitations, and so forth. So defense analysts have little
interest in noting the arrival of safety or placing dangers in context.

Those factors produce selective speech, not necessarily dishonesty.
Politically ambitious analysts tend to focus on how to best combat
threats, not on whether they should be combated or how pressing they
are. They write mostly about operational issues that offend few, rather
than taking the riskier track of questioning established goals, such as
existing alliances. They learn that it is safer for their careers to
warn of dangers other than overreaction. Academic researchers avoid
those pressures to the extent that they have different career
incentives. They are less a part of what they study.62 They rely less on
grants from security agencies and work less often for contractors.

Foreign States

[**[Foreign states]{.mark}** encourage American elites to combat their
enemies via lobbying, trips arranged for U.S. officials and
intellectuals, and publicity campaigns. Because they cannot vote or
contribute to campaign coffers, ideological affinity and [**threat
inflation** are their **main tools** to **gather support for military
aid or commitments**]{.mark}. They [often]{.mark} conflate their
security with Americans' and embellish their liberalism while **[casting
their rivals as illiberal]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Like other interest groups, foreign lobbies can dominate issue areas
that engage no other strong interest. In the language of transaction
costs, foreign lobbies reliably succeed until they concentrate costs
sufficient to motivate rivals. One sort of concentrated cost that limits
foreign lobbies' effectiveness is war. That is why lobbies can rarely
induce Americans to undertake costly acts such as invasions on their
behalf.63 But U.S. security is so profound that foreign lobbies can do a
lot of mischief before they do enough to awaken powerful resistance. The
security loss is typically minor, the consequences remote and hard to
understand. U.S. foreign policies serving the ideological affinities of
vocal minorities are a luxury that safety often affords.

[Long‐​term **[alliances institutionalize interests that
exaggerate]{.mark} the [dangers]{.mark} that the alliance counters**.
The **[most obvious]{.mark}** example [is]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orth
**[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[T]{.mark}**reaty
**[O]{.mark}**rganization]{.underline}, which has generated various
justifications for its existence since the Soviet Union collapsed.
[Foundations and **think tanks** that are focused on keeping the United
States tied to Europe support those threat arguments]{.underline}.
[Employees and affiliates of those organizations maintain **professional
and personal ties** and fly each other across the ocean for conferences.
They all depend to an extent on the notion that the alliance defends
against something]{.underline}. Other U.S. alliances, even informal ones
such as those with Taiwan and Israel, create similar networks of
transnational dependents.

News Media

[The **[media]{.mark}** are more like the national security
establishment's microphone than its watchdog]{.underline}.64 [The media
tend to reflect, rather than evaluate, the threat assessments of the
national security elite for three reasons]{.underline}.65 [First,
**reporters are mostly generalists** **lacking** the **regional or
technical expertise** to thoroughly evaluate government
claims]{.underline}. They are easily awed by military prestige and
knowledge, especially now that the draft is long gone and few reporters
have served. [Second, media outlets **lack incentive** to produce
skeptical analysis even if they can. They win readers by publishing news
quickly. Critical analysis is not their core business. Moreover, **[hype
and alarm attract more readers]{.mark}** than caveat and
caution]{.underline}.66 [Third and most important, information about
security threats is usually hard to gather. It often comes from
dangerous or remote regions. Collecting it requires skill in foreign
languages, an appetite for personal risk, or access to expensive
technologies such as satellites that are mostly controlled by states.
The information is largely secret and thus centrally controlled. Even
when security information is made public, it often requires
interpretation from experts, who tend to either work in government or to
reflect its biases]{.underline}, for the reasons discussed earlier.

[Thus, national security reporting [depends on **official
sources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Those]{.mark} sources
can]{.underline}, for example, [**[grant or revoke access]{.mark} to war
zones or secret information** [as a reward]{.mark} for reporting that
reflects their views. That dependence creates a culture of accommodation
where **reporters cultivate and avoid offending sources**]{.underline}.

Where official consensus is lacking, the media can play something of a
watchdog role. Skeptical reporting increases with divided government,
when conflict about policy arises among or within agencies,
congressional committees, or executive branch officials.67 Officials in
conflict leak information, offer anonymous quotes questioning competing
claims, and hold informative hearings to promote their take. Where the
media checks official claims about threats, it is typically capitalizing
on those schisms and conveying other official doubts rather than
discovering it via gumshoe reporting. There is ample conflict in
American national security policy, particularly when new policies arise.
But consensus about threats generally prevails, preventing the media
from helping check threat exaggeration.

The Presidency

The publicity and authority now commanded by the president and his
national security appointees in the White House give them considerable
power to promote threats. On foreign issues, where Congress plays a
relatively small role, presidents have less competition for public
attention.68 The president can also use his formal powers---including
appointments and budgetary and legislative authority---to pressure
agencies to tow his line about threats or at least to avoid
contradicting it in public.

Presidents rarely use those powers to combat threat inflation, however.
They tend, instead, to echo the national security establishment's
assessments. They do so because their power is more limited than we
often imagine. Even in foreign policy, where power resides more in the
executive branch, the bureaucracy enjoys considerable latitude. Limits
on time, expertise, and popularity check the president's willingness to
persuade others to do his bidding.69 To convince staff members to follow
a particular course requires some presidential effort. Firing an
official for insubordination is a pain and sometimes a scandal. Forcing
an agency to comply with presidential wishes may require various threats
and cajolements. Getting congressional cooperation may require public
struggle. Any of those acts may burn political capital, which presidents
struggle to gather.

Limits on power encourage presidents to choose fights carefully and to
compromise with the bureaucracy and Congress on policy issues. The
president and his agents are less policymakers than policy custodians
who work to manage the compromise that governs particular policy areas
and satisfy interested parties. The status quo, having recently gathered
enough support to exist, is usually the most attainable compromise and
the path of least bureaucratic resistance.70 That working compromise is
manifest in budgets.

Once the president compromises and signs a budget, the many policies it
contains become his own. Explaining his limited power to alter policy is
unlikely to be effective public relations, so presidents will generally
choose instead to promote the compromise policy. The easiest way to do
so is to repeat the standard arguments in the policy's favor, which are
typically those the agencies already make. The result is that
presidential rhetoric about security threats usually reflects the
security establishment's rhetoric. Because the national security
establishment, for the reasons given earlier, tends to overstate
dangers, so does the president.

Nevertheless, there are exceptional circumstances that push presidents
to downplay threats. First, a president advocating military budget cuts
has reason to avoid inflating threats and even to acknowledge safety.
Second, although a president arguing for war is likely to hype the enemy
he hopes to attack, he may play down the threat the war itself poses.
Third, a president trying to end a military conflict should have the
opposite inclinations. Fourth, if the administration hopes to increase
funding to combat a new threat, it may need to shift funds from
organizations or functions dealing with old threats to fund the new
effort. The president may then play down the old threats.

A Sum of Our Fears?

How do those various actors' fears conglomerate? To a large extent, they
do not. There is considerable competition for resources and power within
the national security establishment. That competition encourages
competing perspectives about security threats. Because of the way the
United States constructs budgets, resource competition increases with
bureaucratic proximity. For example, the navy surface fleet's biggest
competitor for dollars is other navy components. Other defense agencies
are a secondary concern, and agencies funded in nondefense budgets an
even more remote one. Competition also increases with austerity, which
heightens tradeoffs among and within defense agencies. As noted,
organizations competing for support might debase the risks that rivals
peddle so as to eat their rivals' budgetary lunches.

Still, the interests that make up the national security establishment
are more cooperative than competitive. One reason is that budgets rise
more often than they fall. Second, strong organizations such as the
military services can suppress conflict in their ranks, thereby
preventing rifts---or at least publicity about rifts. Third, a similar
ethos, colloquially called "jointness," has infused the Department of
Defense, especially since the passage of the Goldwater‐​Nichols
legislation in 1986.71 Through various measures, the law encourages
cooperation among the services, and prevents open debate. A more
important source of jointness is the tradition, dating to the Kennedy
administration, where each military service gets about the same share of
the defense budget every year.72 The tradition encourages the branches
to produce arguments that grow the total defense budget, rather than
attacking the relevance of rivals.

[**[Left unchallenged]{.mark}**, the **[overwrought fears]{.mark}** that
justify U.S. **security policy** [become]{.mark} a kind of **[social
convention]{.mark}**, **[especially among informed
elites]{.mark}**]{.underline}.73 People adapt their opinions to their
peers' because they learn from them and because [**conformity** is
**socially easier** than dissent. **Agreement** tends to **make people's
views more extreme**]{.underline}.74 [That problem is particularly acute
in Washington's security debates, where ambition checks dissent. The
less threat deflation analysts chance, the less others feel free to echo
it]{.underline}.

Conclusion: Prospects for Balance

Threat inflation bridges the gap between what U.S. defense policy is and
what it claims to be. U.S. defense policy is an expression of
international power and a compromise among jostling entities unified by
a preference for military action or spending. U.S. defense policy
pretends to be a servant of domestic security.

Power has made the United States more prone to exaggerate security
threats. Wealth and safety limited exposure to the international dangers
that encourage military restraint. The military actions that power
allowed, meanwhile, spawned political interests that prefer ambitious
military policies abroad. Those interests inflate threats to convince
everyone else that those policies serve the national interest. [The
threat inflators do not sing together exactly, but their collective
voices produce a powerful chorus. Because the voices that are heard
mostly benefit from a perception of danger, the world they
portray]{.underline} to Americans, especially those who pay attention to
the news, [is one of swirling dangers]{.underline}. At least during
peace, truth about security falls victim to a free‐​rider problem.

[**[Still]{.mark}**, U.S. politics, including the current sort,
**[occasionally favor the growth of political interests]{.mark} that are
prone [to resist threat inflation]{.mark}** or even to understate
threats. Examination of those conditions points at ways to rebalance
debate and improve U.S. security policy. We escape bad security policy
**[not by]{.mark}** quixotic [attempts to **banish**]{.mark}
organizational and other [**parochial interests** from]{.mark} political
[**debate**, but **by getting new participants into the
fight**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

On the contrary, [poststructuralism can help with making sense of
security in the age of 'post-truth' politics]{.underline}.
Poststructuralism [presents a host of conceptual and methodological
tools helpful for uncovering the conditions of possibility which have
allowed the politics of 'post-truth' to thrive]{.underline}. It can also
assist in understanding, challenging and changing the contemporary
insecurities so bound up with it. Most significantly, you do not have to
be a paid-up postie to see where these insights can map on to other
approaches, or to derive something useful from the toolkit. As a
starting point, this essay explains how several insights of
poststructuralism can help us navigate the 'post-truth' security
environment.

[[**Poststructuralism** is often **blamed for**]{.mark} **the ills of
['post-truth']{.mark}** politics]{.underline}. [This argument, however,
is '**[based on a]{.mark} shallow [caricature]{.mark} of the theory**
and an exaggerated estimation of its effects']{.underline} (Perrin
2017). Poststructuralism is [not a dogma that demands that we all reject
'facts']{.underline}. The point is rather to recognise how particular
ideas and practices gain the status of 'facts' or 'common sense'
knowledge as a result of the way in which they are represented,
abstracted or interpreted. Key to this process is the issue of power
relations, whereby particular understandings and assumptions about all
areas of social life, be it science, sexuality, or security, are
normalised in place of alternatives. [The point]{.underline}, then, of
poststructuralism isn't to say that 'anything goes', it is to explore
and analyse how '"truths" are mobilized and meted out' (Epstein 2005,
13). Poststructuralists like Foucault 'recognized the way in which
competing narratives about, or constructions of, reality are involved
with political power...but that was to identify the problem rather than
to cause it' (Leith 2017).

[[The **solution**]{.mark} **to 'post-truth'** politics and 'fake news'
[does **not** lie in the **refuting of claims**]{.mark} through fact
checking and the quest for a more objective notion of truth. Rather,
research has shown that **[fact-checking]{.mark}** articles **[rarely
have as much influence]{.mark}** as the false claims they set out to
debunk, [and]{.mark} they actually [**perpetuate the dissemination of
falsehoods** to **larger audiences**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Vargo, Guo,
and Amazeen 2017). **[[Poststructuralism]{.underline}]{.mark}** can
[point us towards [a **more effective response**]{.mark}, based not
around attempting to 'reveal essential truths that have been obscured'
but rather in **examining 'how certain representations underlie the
production of knowledge and identities** and how these representations
make various courses of action possible']{.underline} (Doty 1996, 4).

[This is **important**, because it has repercussions in the everyday
lived experiences of people across the planet. Poststructuralism has
afforded an **attention to language**, aesthetics, practices, emotions,
and the everyday which can **help us to understand how real people
experience insecurity** in the contemporary 'post-truth'
era]{.underline}. A case in point here is President Trump's attempt to
ban Muslims from certain countries entering the U.S. Such policies have
become socially plausible largely because of how Muslims are
represented, and have been represented, as threats -- particularly
during the 'War on Terror' (see Said 1997; Jackson 2005). As the
experiences of 'fact checkers' bears out, reiterating that Muslims are
not by definition a threat is not enough, nor is it likely to be
effective.

Here, poststructuralism makes an important contribution. To date,
[[**research** in **security studies**]{.mark} that draws upon
**poststructuralism**]{.underline} and postcolonialism [has
[offer]{.mark}ed precisely [the **tools**]{.mark} with which [to]{.mark}
uncover, critique and **[destabilise]{.mark}** the [**representations**,
**knowledge claims** and **identities**]{.mark} that make such racist
and Islamophobic policies possible]{.underline} (see for example
Heath-Kelly, Jarvis, and Baker-Beall 2014; Fitzgerald, Ali, and
Armstrong 2016). [Methods such as genealogy and deconstruction are
[**vital** in **understanding**]{.mark}, critiquing [and
**changing**]{.mark} the [**political, social, technological and
cultural conditions** which **enable** the likes of
**Trump**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Trump's rhetoric constructs a notion of
American identity which is built upon racial and gendered dichotomies of
a white America threatened by a non-white Other; whether that be Mexican
'rapists' or Islamic 'terrorists'. As a recent range of studies under
the auspices of 'critical studies on security' have demonstrated in this
very journal, [methods of deconstruction]{.underline} and genealogy [can
help to uncover and challenge these discourses and their impact on
security]{.underline} (Bentley, Eroukhmanoff, and Hackett 2017;
Eroukhmanoff 2017; Hassan 2017).

Using tools such as these, it becomes possible to pick apart the
structures of inequality, sexism, and xenophobia that have enabled the
'post-truth' policies of politicians like Trump, and have encouraged
people to seek out 'alternative' sources of news which speak more to
their interests and beliefs. All these phenomena are underpinned by
representations that construct knowledge, shape identities, and serve to
legitimise certain forms of politics. [[The **success of
'post-truth'**]{.mark} politics, **[populist]{.mark}**
politician[s]{.mark}, [and **hyper-partisan news**]{.mark} providers [is
**not because**]{.mark} a group of [**academics** encouraged people to
question]{.mark} that which they take for granted. It is **because** of
**representations** and '**identity**; the power of a brand; the
**prioritizing** of a "friendly" or **in-group** source; the
**signalling** of a claim rather than its **factual accuracy**; the
force of an **established narrative**, and so on']{.underline} (Leith
2017, emphasis in original). [In seeking to deconstruct these embedded
inequities, poststructuralists trouble some of the **core obstacles** to
**alternative forms of politics** and offer the means by which those at
the sharp end of contemporary structural inequalities can highlight,
interrogate, and challenge the conditions of their lived
experience]{.underline}.

This is at the core of **[[poststructuralist
work]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [It is **not** an **unrelenting pessimism**
about the state of the world; it [is **not** a **refusal to engage with
the 'facts**]{.mark} of the matter' -- indeed, it is [the
**opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For, [poststructuralists]{.underline}
are intimately concerned with the injustices and inequalities so
innocuously entrenched within current ways of thinking, being and doing.
That is, [they **interrogate** the ways in which the **social
structures** developed that **enabled a politics of 'post-truth'** to
become not only possible, but also palatable to various
groups]{.underline}. Yet, they are also concerned with the contingency
of this process, the structures of power and authority that helped it to
evolve, and the disruptions to those structures that can open space for
alternative ways to develop -- an 'inherently positive exercise'
(Campbell 2007, 225). [By challenging that which is taken for granted,
poststructuralism is in the business of making politics and society less
exclusionary, more inclusive, and less contingent on the dominance of
the marginalised]{.underline}.

[If we are to push for a security studies that works towards helping
'real people in real places']{.underline} (Booth 2005, 272) [in the era
of 'post-truth' politics we should not blame a caricature of
poststructuralism for making the world more insecure]{.underline}.
[Rather]{.underline} we need to take seriously the insights that
poststructuralism offers on language, practice, aesthetics, emotions,
and the everyday discontents of race, gender, and class and how they
intersect in the 'post-truth' era. [In providing the toolkit to pick
apart these inequities, **poststructuralism** may just provide a
platform for [**making people more judicious** in their **media
consumption**]{.mark} habits, ending racist policies at home and abroad,
and for addressing global inequalities]{.underline}.

6\. Conclusion

In conclusion, developments in EU/West-Russia relations over recent
years seem to confirm the hypothesis of the ontological security
literature 'that actors prefer relationships they have practiced and
recognize, even if attachment to these relationships maintains conflict
or reproduces other harmful, but recognizable and certain, situations'
(Chernobrov, 2016: 3). In particular, it seems to confirm Mitzen\'s
(2006) alternative account of the endurance of security dilemmas
detrimental to the physical and economic security of the parties
involved. For Mitzen, security dilemmas are less about problems of
(mis)trust in a Hobbesian anarchy as realist accounts contend, and more
about how relations of enmity -- despite raising concerns about physical
safety -- ultimately enhance a sense of identity and provide a
comforting narrative about the nature of world politics. What this
teaches us, Mitzen [contends]{.underline}, is [that **ontological
security** concerns often seem to trump concerns of
physical]{.underline} security ([also **Rumelili, 2015**]{.underline}).
[To this extent, Western]{.underline} responses of sanctions, [veiled
threats of further measures, NATO military manoeuvres]{.underline} and
troop deployments to Poland and the Baltic States, [while understandable
as such, [only **feed into a**]{.mark}**n underlying [dynamic in
Russia]{.mark}** that is **clearly welcomed by many** for its
reinforcement of a **narrative that replaces anxiety** about the future
with a **sense of certitude** in terms of **Russia\'s identity and
mission** in the world]{.underline}. [Insofar as **Russian responses do
likewise in**]{.underline} Europe and [**the West** we might even speak
of [a '**spiral of ontological (in)security**]{.mark}'
generation]{.underline} (Lupovici, draft). [[**The attraction of
tropes** of]{.mark} a new Cold War and a return of [geopolitics **is
precisely that they salve anxiety**]{.mark} about current events [by
**fitting**]{.mark} **them [into]{.mark} clearly [established systems of
meaning]{.mark}**, though doing so entails reducing anxieties by
emphasising a world of threats and fears connected to an increasingly
securitised other]{.underline}.

[There are obviously potential problems with this. [While]{.mark} the
**(re)-[securitisation]{.mark} of enemy others** [may]{.mark} help
[ameliorate]{.mark} anxieties about a sense of **[ontological
insecurity]{.mark}**, doing so entails ramping up the overall sense of
threat and [carries the danger of **becoming
self-fulfilling**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such practices inevitably
entail the danger that the complexities of contemporary events are
overlooked in favour of seeing them as just further examples of an
established pattern. Thus, we see a tendency to depict events in
**Ukraine**]{.underline} ([as well as]{.underline} suspected sightings
of Russian submarines in Swedish waters, [interceptions of Russian
military aircraft, or NATO redeployments in the region]{.underline})
[simply 'as **signifiers of Cold War times**']{.underline} (Chernobrov,
2016: 3). [The danger is that this **[results in 'unnecessary
escalation']{.mark}**, with such conflation being both 'attractive and
dangerous'; dangerous because 'It [creates an **illusion of
predictability** but **prevents seeing other dimensions** of the problem
and **leads to a**]{.mark} **known and well-rehearsed [routine of policy
escalation]{.mark}** and popular suspicion' **all [premised on the
illusion that we actually know the other]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Chernobrov, 2016: 3-4). For Chernobrov (2016: 2), [all this constitutes
a form of '(mis)recognition dictated by a societal need for ontological
security' and which is further evidenced, for instance, in how official
European support for **Ukrainian protestors**]{.underline} on Maidan
square [was largely **premised on identifying them as archetypal
cosmopolitan Europeans 'like us'**]{.underline}. [The protestors of the
Arab Spring movements were identified likewise]{.underline}. [The
attraction of doing so is that it serves to confirm the]{.underline}
EU\'s own [sense of self-identity and founding narrative. The problem,
of course, and where (mis)recognition comes in, is that these groups
were much more diverse, and which in the Ukrainian case arguably led
to]{.underline} the EU -- and not least European media (Ojala & Pantti,
2017: 46-7) -- [**overlooking fascist and neo-Nazi elements** amongst
the protestors and the subsequent new coalition government]{.underline}
(Chernobrov, 2016: 5, 8; Toal, 2017: 213; Youngs, 2017: 121).8 Of
course, acknowledging that we do not actually know the full nature of
the situation we face, or exactly who the other is and what motivates
them, can generate anxiety, with this being why locating new events in
established narratives is so tempting.

To end, the above analysis has emphasised that calls for the EU to
become 'more geopolitical' in its relations with Russia are problematic
in several respects. First, it has been demonstrated that the EU is
already (and always has been) a geopolitical actor. However, the EU\'s
geopolitics are heavily imbricated with geoeconomic (and postmodern)
elements, where through geostrategies like the ENP/EaP the EU actively
engages in practices of spatial ordering beyond its borders. Moreover,
these geostrategies also perform ontological security seeking functions
insofar as they routinize particular conceptions of EU self-identity and
established understandings of the nature of the EU\'s salient
environment. As such, however, they can also be challenged, undermined
and destabilised, and the EU\'s sense of ontological security imperilled
as a result. Calls for the EU to become more geopolitical -- where this
equates to a desire for a more modernist Cold War style geopolitics --
reflect how far the EU\'s sense of ontological security has been
challenged in the neighbourhood (but also more broadly).

Crucially, though, it has been argued that such calls are themselves a
form of ontological security seeking, an attempt to replace one set of
narratives of spatial ordering and self-identity generation, with
another felt to be better able to account for the nature of the
contemporary situation. [The temptation of this modernist turn is that
it re-establishes a sense of cognitive control and order over what has
become felt to be unpredictable and unexpected. The danger, however, is
that [the]{.mark} sense of **[ontological certitude]{.mark}**
established [is **too simplified**]{.mark}, overrides the complexities
of the contemporary situation, but in doing so threatens to become
**self-fulfilling**]{.underline}. Thus, just as it is wrong to suggest
the EU does not do geopolitics, it is similarly wrong to suggest that
modernist geopolitics captures the full essence of Russia, a country
that is also heavily integrated into the globalised world economy, with
this significantly raising the costs of it withdrawing from such
interactions or excessively damaging its image and reputation with
potential (Western) investors. [This should also make us question
whether simple modernist geopolitical calculation is all that is at play
in Russia\'s recent, more overt geopolitical moves in Georgia, Ukraine
and Syria, with analysts suggesting a range of explanations are
available]{.underline} (Toal, 2017, Triesman, 2016). [As such, meeting
Russia\'s traditional modernist geopolitical moves by resorting to its
own modernist geopolitical responses, not only threatens to generate a
spiral effect, but also **[overlooks]{.mark} the possibility [that
alternative strategies may be available]{.mark}**. It may
**[also]{.mark}**, however, **[only]{.mark} serve to [enhance]{.mark}**
the sense of [**ontological anxiety** within the **EU** by]{.mark}
**further [challenging]{.mark} core elements of [its]{.mark} own
[self-narrative]{.mark}** [as a **peace organization** aimed]{.mark}
precisely [at **overcoming**]{.mark} **militarism, nationalism and
[traditional geopolitics in Europe]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Guzzini,
2012: 62).

securitization dynamics since the Cold War**, [**evidenced** by]{.mark}
our **comparative analysis of older and newer NATO texts**]{.underline}.
[Although Chinese disinformation attempts have also begun to enter into
NATO threat language, NATO's primary discursive security identity
continues to develop against and around Russia]{.underline}. [This is
most evident in our **[longitudinal analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline} of
pre- and post-2014 documents that [prioritize Russia as a threat alike,
implying that **[it is not really disinformation]{.mark}** or fake news
agenda [that is **rendering Russia a threat for
NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This suggests the hypothesis that **[even
if tech]{.mark}nologies [change]{.mark}**, NATO-Russia [rivalry will
**remain securitized the same way**]{.mark}. In other words,
**contemporary disinformation and fake news agenda** is [a
**continuation of**]{.mark} **the same NATO-Russia rivalry** -- at least
**in [discursive form]{.mark}** -- through newer mediums]{.underline}.

### L -- AI: Arms Race

#### Securitizing an "AI arms race" is [self-defeating]{.underline} -- drives acceleration, making accidents and escalation more likely

The "AI arms race"

Often,12 one hears the phrase "AI arms race," 13 especially in regard to
competition14 between major powers. Yet an **[AI arms
race]{.underline}** seems [a particularly unfortunate and **misleading**
phrase]{.underline}. Since 1957,15 [myriad scholars have attempted to
understand arms races]{.underline}, including how one can identify and
measure16 them and what the potential effects of one are.

While there have certainly been academic and policy disputes over the
last 62 years, [there is one important consensus to note about arms
races: looking at one particular dimension of a state's behavior is not
sufficient]{.underline}. Arms races deal with military build ups, arms
expenditures, rivalry, alliances, territorial disputes, economic
policies, and more. As yet, however, there has been no coherent or
comprehensive discussion about the so-called AI arms race. [For example:
How is AI by itself a weapon? Or is the "race" merely military
modernization efforts that include automation, autonomy, or AI enabled
military systems? How would we even begin to find, label and
disaggregate the numbers to claim that there is an arms race between
rivals regarding only AI?]{.underline} Indeed, the [discussion of an AI
arms race is reminiscent of the hyperbolic and mislabeled rhetoric
surrounding "cyber bombs"]{.underline} 17 in the battle again ISIS.

Of course, [there are quite spectacular claims about AI's potential
benefits and risks]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir Putin18
fanned that fire when he claimed that "whoever becomes the leader in
this space \[AI\] will become the ruler of the world." But talking about
technological competition -- in research, adoption, and deployment -- in
all sectors of multiple economies and in warfare is not really an arms
race. Indeed, [to **frame** this **competition in military terms** risks
the adoption of **policies** or regulations that could **escalate
rivalry** between states and **increase** the **likelihood** of **actual
conflict**]{.underline}.

More accurately stated, the current situation is one of AI competition,
with variations of technological proliferation and diffusion. In some
cases, countries may want to limit the amount and kinds of specific AI
systems that proliferate to other countries or non-state actors. In
these instances, it will more than likely be particular kinds of
components or platforms that are at issue. The International Traffic in
Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR),
the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and
Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, the Australia Group, or the Missile
Technology Control Regime are but a few regimes that are meant to deal
with such proliferation issues.

Diffusion, however, is a different animal. Widely available commercial
off the shelf components, a widely available and open source knowledge
base, and wide access to large amounts of data make limiting the
diffusion of AI knowledge almost impossible. There are necessary
ingredients for AI, including access to computing power and sufficient
amounts of data. Some actors possess more of these ingredients than
others, but that advantage does not preclude individuals, groups,
companies, or states from obtaining access to and knowledge about AI. As
greater emphasis is placed on the economic and security benefits of
using AI systems, AI will become more diffused because the incentive
structure rewards diffusion.

Managing the risks of proliferation and diffusion of a knowledge base is
an entirely different enterprise than restraining an arms race. In the
case of artificial intelligence, rather than looking at what sorts of
actions are required for deterrence, what balances may affect conflict
onset or escalation, world leaders should turn their focus to how to
foster responsible competition.

[Mitigating the risks associated with AI is not a single-shot
activity]{.underline}. Certainly there are technological solutions, such
as researching new ways of testing, verifying, and validating systems
that include the technologies that fall under the AI umbrella. There
even may be novel ways of constraining unwanted system behaviors by
generating new architectures or safety controls.
[Ultimately]{.underline}, however, [**reducing** the **risks** that AI
will be abused **requires a reframing of the way in which we think,
talk, write about, and deploy AI**. The **problems of AI misuse** are
**human problems**; they are problems exhibited by all dual-use
technologies, not just AI. Control of artificial intelligence lies with
humans, because they are the **moral agents** responsible for the
design, development, and deployment of AI]{.underline}.

### L -- AI: China

#### Securitizing [Chinese]{.underline} "[AI arms racing]{.underline}" and "[digital autocracy]{.underline}" is [self-defeating]{.underline} -- does [NOT reflect reality]{.underline} on the ground -- obscures the similar impact of [US]{.underline} arms racing and exports of AI-driven surveillance tech -- AND only escalates competition and conflict

**Can 20** Muhammed Can, University of Minho, Portugal, "Deciphering
Factual Realities in the Process of Securitizing Artificial
Intelligence," Chapter 14, *Analyzing Future Applications of AI,
Sensors, and Robotics in Society*, IGI Global, September 2020, DOI
10.4018/978-1-7998-3499-1.ch014 /GoGreen!

These all initiatives are a clear sign of competition on AI narratives
between global powers. According to Buzan et al. (1998, p.6) three steps
are necessary to talk about proper security issue. Firstly, there should
be identification of existential threats. Secondly, emergency action and
finally effects on inter-unit relations by breaking free of rules.
Interestingly enough, [the **US narrative** --- both in **government
papers** and **media**]{.underline} --- on [regarding **'AI arms race'**
is **more aggressive than China** even though there have been ongoing
push backs from both parties]{.underline} particularly on Huawei's 5G
technology and surveillance system.

For instance, Kania (2017) argues that China has closely followed the
U.S technological advancements over the decades in order to develop
asymmetric tools to exploit the U.S vulnerabilities in a military
context. It is almost certain that China occupies at the top of the main
concern of the U.S given the catching up initiatives to compete launched
by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in various realms
(Auslin, 2018). [Apart from the military context of competition, the US
narrative regarding China's AI progression contains the import of
**authoritarian surveillance** system]{.underline}. [This anxiety leads
to the question of whether liberal democracies will be affected by these
trends?]{.underline} (Thompson and Bremmer, 2018). Dangers of harnessing
AI-based tools range from creating bots to manipulate social media to
the 'deepfakes' --- AI generated fake videos --- which might lead to
unexpected consequences (Scharre,2019). [Authoritarian regimes might use
'deepfakes' to eliminate opponents and predictive machines to determine
potential trouble-makers which is evident Chinese social credit
system]{.underline} (Ibid). [It is also no secret that China have
imported AI-based surveillance systems to the various
countries]{.underline}. For instance, in 2018 China and Zimbabwe along
with Angola and Ethiopia signed an agreement on surveillance system ---
facial recognition software provided by a Chinese company the CloudWalk
--- so as to monitor population (Gwaga, 2018).

Undoubtedly, these [revelations have brought about concerns regarding
future usage of AI given the Chinese multilateral initiatives. However,
these instances **cannot represent the entire reality in the ground**.
It is evident with the recent United Arab Emirates surveillance system
case]{.underline}. According to Schectman and Bing (2019) former the US
security officers --- including intelligence and counterterrorism
experts --- helped to create Development Research Exploitation and
Analysis Department (DREAD). Even though this surveillance system
intended to provide security assistance, "the UAE unit expanded its hunt
far beyond suspected extremists to include a Saudi women's rights
activist, diplomats at the United Nations and personnel at FIFA, the
world soccer body" (Ibid, para.3).

Accordingly, [**authoritarian export of AI-based tools** is not only the
problem unless the **UAE** and other **Gulf** Region **monarchies**
recognised as democracies by the US]{.underline}. [The crux of matter is
narrating existential threat in different landscapes where
securitization of AI becomes clear. These narratives create various
factual realities regardless of what is happening on the ground.
**Embedding** the **AI** concept to **grand strategies** --- economic,
military, societal terms --- is the **part of taking pre-emptive
measures** of parties, if not extraordinary ones]{.underline}. One thing
is certain that strategic competition to harness AI has already begun
between China and the US. Recent trade war, 5G debates, information
warfare, malign propaganda accusations, cyber espionage and algorithmic
warfare concepts are manifestations of this strategic competition.

Even though these political warfare instruments are not a new phenomenon
--- the Cold War history rife with different types of them --- AI has
opened a new frontier to the strategic competition between China and the
US. Three points are significant in this manner. Firstly, convincing
audience that China/ the US is existential threat is a part of
securitization process of AI. Secondly, [it is problematic to use the
'Cold War' analogy in this context that might be misleading due to the
fact that main competition took place between the US and the Soviet
Union in various domains including ideological and military arenas.
China has not been posing an ideological threat to the rest of world
given its dependence to the global economy]{.underline}. Thirdly,
extraordinary measures are not fully employed by the parties due to the
probability of escalation of confrontations. However, much of these
conflicts has been undergoing below the acceptable thresholds --- in
cyberspace and grey zones --- with the chance of plausible deniability.
Therefore, [it is **highly likely** to witness **complete securitization
of AI** in the near future as techniques and **impacts** of AI **expands
into different spectrums**]{.underline}.

As for the realities on the ground regarding current AI arms race, China
is spending less than what previously has been presumed by the
authorities (Hao, 2019). The vast majority of current AI budget of China
goes to non-military research and development, notably
smart-infrastructure development, robotics and fundamental algorithm
development. This argument has been borne out by the latest report of
Center for Security and Emerging Technology (Acharya and Arnold, 2019).

**\[TABLE 1 OMITTED\]**

It is not to say that China will keep these efforts in the area of
civilian perspective of AI. As any powerful state does, it will harness
emerging technologies in different theatres be it for becoming
militarily global dominant power or for undermining opponents' social
cohesion. [**Current realities** are **still premature** to designate
**China** as the **direct threat**. It is **more about** the convincing
audience --- as a part of securitization --- to **justify extraordinary
measures**/ policies taken by any authorities of given
countries]{.underline}.

CONCLUSION

[The advent of new technologies provides]{.underline} new opportunities
to the states along with [tricky paradoxes]{.underline}. Needless to
say, AI is the one of them. [From governing outer space to the nuclear
competition, history jam-packed with cases]{.underline}. China and the
US are the major actors in AI industry along with Israel and the EU
countries. [However, Chinese exponential growth in AI strengthens threat
perception of China]{.underline}. [**Narratives** that have rendered
**China** as an **existential threat** are **direct consequences of the
US foreign policy approach**]{.underline} which is not entirely
different from the narratives are being used by Trump administration
towards allied countries given the current trade tariffs and
protectionist priorities of the US foreign policy. In the same vein,
[**existential threat narrative** of the US with respect to **Chinese AI
strategy** can be regarded as the reflection of **securitization**
process]{.underline}. Securitization process has three distinct pillars.
Firstly, securitizing actor should claim that referent object is
existentially threatened. Secondly, there should be an extraordinary
measure to be taken by securitizing actor in order to eliminate threat.
Finally, audience should be convinced that measures are necessary to
deal with threat.

In this context, narratives from both parties to alienate each other
might be considered as the endeavour to convince the audience. However,
in this process determining extraordinary measures are still vague.
[**Cyberattacks** and **algorithmic warfare** between the US and China
might be regarded as extraordinary even though it gives **plausible
deniability** manoeuvre to the parties given its grey nature. Majority
of Chinese AI applications are criticized under]{.underline} the two
categories. [First]{.underline} one is [**internal** developments ---
social credit system, mass surveillance and facial recognition systems
--- which plays relatively **equal role** to **reify Chinese threat
narrative**]{.underline}. [Second]{.underline} one [is]{.underline} the
[**transferring Chinese AI capabilities** to third countries that might
empower **authoritarian regimes**]{.underline}. [Nevertheless, **the US
is not immune from these critiques**]{.underline} given the
aforementioned facts. [What we are witnessing is two different
**competing realities** --- which are part of securitization process ---
in AI domain that **will escalate threat perception and strategic
competition** between the US and China]{.underline}.

Undoubtedly, this leads us to sensitive topics regarding the AI,
particularly as to possible effects on AI to societies. For instance,
[how]{.underline} the way of [**framing AI** in
**securitization**]{.underline} process [**alter** the **AI's
exponential growth**]{.underline}? And in what ways societies could be
affected from this strategic competition? Therefore, it is safe to
arrive at the conclusion that securitization process of AI is vital to
digger deep into complex relations between great powers and influences
on future societies.

#### Securitizing [discriminatory AI]{.underline} backfires, tanking norm generation -- gets mapped to geopolitical Others like China, alienating potential cooperators

[One of the key narrative tropes is that of **biased AI**]{.underline}.
[What has been foregrounded are **gender** and **race** biases, as well
as the **lack of legal regulations** over the use of personal
data]{.underline}. For instance, the Campaign warned that human biases
will end up influencing intelligent algorithms and publicly stated that
'achieving a ban on fully autonomous weapons or killer robots is a
feminist issue' (CSKR 2020b). [In this context it was also **stressed**
that **lethal autonomous weapons** 'increase the risk of **targeted
violence against classes** of individuals, including ethnic cleansing
and **genocide**']{.underline} (Stop Autonomous Weapons n.d.-b). Another
trusted source provides virtually the same information: 'Autonomous
weapons are ideal for ... selectively killing a particular ethnic group'
(FLI 2015). [Increasingly one also hears the argument that autonomous
weapons 'could become powerful instruments of violence and oppression,
especially when linked to surveillance and data systems']{.underline}
(FLI n.d.-b). The Canadian component of the Campaign to Stop Killer
Robots provides the following, more general, explanation:

> Killer robots will mostly require artificial intelligence to function,
> and artificial intelligence requires data to "think." For those of us
> whose personal data has been available on the internet since we were
> children, this is a massive risk to our safety and freedom. (Osler
> 2021)

[But]{.underline} it should not be forgotten that [a heightened focus on
racism, gender-based discrimination, and personal data safety has been
**uneven across regions and countries**. However]{.underline} fair and
[rightful the concerns, placing particular emphasis on these issues can
**further alienate** some parties (e.g., **China**) **from the
negotiation process**]{.underline}.

### L -- AI: LAWS

#### Securitizing LAWS is [self-defeating]{.underline} -- inevitable [threat inflation]{.underline} perversely [empowers blocking coalitions]{.underline}, making [norm-setting]{.underline} even [less likely]{.underline}

**Hynek 22** Nik Hynek, professor specializing in security studies at

[Broad]{.underline}, sometimes [**inaccurate** or **problematic**,
**generalizations** have also been made]{.underline}. For instance,
[there has been too much focus on the current **arms race in
AI**]{.underline}. [The social imaginary of '\[a\]n artificially
intelligent]{.underline} \[emphasis added\] [system tasked with
autonomous targeting']{.underline} (Sauer 2016) [is certainly part of
what makes killer robots fearsome]{.underline}. So arguments of this
sort have surfaced: 'Starting a military AI arms race is a bad idea, and
should be prevented by a ban on offensive autonomous weapons beyond
meaningful human control' (FLI 2015). The Asilomar AI
[[Principles]{.underline}]{.mark}, proposed by AI experts in 2017, are
also [formulated in a way [that identifi]{.mark}es [the]{.mark} current
**[arms race in AI]{.mark}** directly [with **autonomous killing
machines**]{.mark}]{.underline}: 'AI Arms Race Principle: An arms race
in lethal autonomous weapons should be avoided' (FLI 2017b). The same
concerns have even been explicitly presented as involving a clear and
present danger. The UNSG, António Guterres, stated, for example, at the
Web Summit in 2018: 'The weaponization of artificial intelligence is a
serious danger \[emphasis added\]' (Guterres 2018). [It is, however, [a
**reductionist trap**]{.mark}. Such [a **narrow definition of the race**
puts aside **other uses of AI military systems**]{.mark} and
networks]{.underline}, as shown in Chapter 3. [Inaccurate
representations of current R&D efforts [**make it easier** for]{.mark}
the other side, represented mainly by the **[world leaders in]{.mark}
AWS [development]{.mark}**[, to **dismiss pro-ban arguments
altogether**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The killer robots rhetoric is also grounded in the discourse on weapons
of mass destruction (WMD). For example, health professionals highlighted
in their aforementioned open letter that 'lethal autonomous weapons can
... become weapons of mass destruction enabling very few to kill very
many' (FLI n.d.-a). The Future of Life Institute also define lethal
autonomous weapons as 'a new class of weapon of mass destruction' (FLI
n.d.-c). The arms control advocacy viral video Slaughterbots visually
demonstrated how killer drone swarms turn into robotic weapons of mass
destruction (Stop Autonomous Weapons 2017). It is yet another attempt to
take a short cut that is, however, not necessarily the best solution.
The [[**analogy** between **WMD** and **AWS** is]{.mark} **deeply
problematic**]{.underline} but it is rather an attempt to re-create the
emotional appeal of WMD. WMD-based language is, in most cases, pervasive
enough to stigmatize the weapons in question as immoral and
unacceptable. Enemark (2011) concluded, however, and in this we concur,
that the term WMD is 'misleading from a technological viewpoint'. He
argued that it 'obscures the paramount threat of nuclear weapons,
exaggerates the destructive power of chemical weapons, and is unhelpful
or counterproductive when used in the context of biological weapons'.
One can safely argue that [the term is]{.underline} similarly
[unproductive, and]{.underline} may even be
**[[counterproductive]{.underline}]{.mark}** if not applied carefully,
[in the case of **AWS**]{.underline}. In particular, [it bears the risk
of over-simplification]{.underline} in that case. Chapter 4 makes clear
that there are many proposed benefits to the actual use (as opposed to
the benefits that deterrence yields, for instance, in the case of
nuclear weapons) of AWS. This is, at the very least, what distinguishes
AWS from all other categories of WMD. [Falling into the **reductionist
trap** of such umbrella terms and hastily dismissing substantive
counterarguments, pro-ban activists **[risk jeopardizing the success of
the whole enterprise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Fear of killer robots is]{.underline} also [stoked by their extremely
stereotyped presentation]{.underline} in science fiction, [often invoked
to symbolize and visually represent danger]{.underline}. Media coverage
of the Campaign and autonomous weapons has broadly featured images of
terrifying humanoid military robots, as seen in science fiction films
such as The Terminator (e.g., Walsh 2015; Devlin 2018). The Terminator
has indeed become a central metaphor in the killer robots discourse. In
one of the BBC reports, virtually the same visual representation was
even accompanied by the following words: '"Killer robots" may seem like
something from a sci-fi film, but reality is catching up' (Smith 2017).
In a Forbes report, a very similar image was captioned as '\[t\]he
reality of the rise of autonomous weapons systems' (Pandya 2019). These
examples clearly illustrate the importance of visuals in threat
construction and presentation. Amnesty International also highlighted
the possible link between science fiction and autonomous weapons:
'"Killer Robots" will not be a thing of science fiction for long'
(Amnesty International 2015). What needs to be stressed, however, is
that the Campaign has repeatedly tried to dispel the illusion of killer
robots that look like the Terminator. One of their earliest joint
statements cited roboticist Noel Sharkey as saying that '\[k\]iller
robots are not self-willed "Terminator"-style robots' (CSKR 2013).
AI-enabled weapons, even if still under development, do not really have
anything in common with the Terminator, as shown in Chapter 3. However,
as also spotted by Carpenter (2016: 60), [there is a direct
contradiction between what the Campaign claims and how it is
represented, fairly widely, by other actors directly or indirectly
involved in the cultivation of killer robots as a threat]{.underline}.
[**Misrepresentations** of the threat -- be they intentional or
unintentional -- do have an **adverse effect** on the
**[securitization]{.mark}** process because they **[make it even easier
for the other side to lightly dismiss]{.mark}** arguments
made]{.underline} by the Campaign.

Concluding remarks

This chapter uncovered the paradox related to securitization efforts in
a broader sense and the one specific case studied here: greater
efficiency does not necessarily translate into greater effectiveness. On
one hand, it allowed us to fill the existing gap in the securitization
literature. As we made clear, the problem of oversecuritization has
heretofore received scant attention. [We argued and showed that the
continuum of securitization, i.e., the **progression** from **normalcy**
to the recognition of an **existential threat** and the **adoption of
extraordinary measures**, is **far more complex than
that**]{.underline}. It is no less important to inquire into
**[securitization efforts]{.underline}** that [begin as useful and
gradually **[become counter-productive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Here we
offered two analytical tools with which to address such problems as soon
as they are discovered: the concept of hybridization and that of
grafting. We demonstrated how [the increasingly hybridized, more
diverse, and seemingly more politically powerful authority of the ones
who perform the securitizing act paradoxically leads them away from the
desired goal]{.underline}. The chapter also discovered numerous traps
related to threat construction and presentation. Grafting a new
representation of threat onto a range of other forms of perceived
threats is not necessarily helpful, as we show. If discursive and visual
frames are not carefully selected, [[the **call for multilateral
regulatory action** might **seem stronger at first glance** but
will]{.mark}, also quite [**paradoxically**, have a **lower chance of
materializing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, [the pro-ban movement still lacks direct leverage over
ban-resisting actors, as leverage maintained by politically and
economically dominant states over all other actors in the equation
prevails]{.underline}. Hall (1997: 594--597) was correct in pointing out
that moral authority operates on balance with other 'power resources',
mainly state economic and political(-military) capabilities. The legal
status of the OSCE in relation to participating states is non-binding
(OSCE n.d.). Despite its increasing prominence, the EP has little
influence over member-states in the domain of EU security and defence
policy (EP n.d.). The EU's political stance is still fragmented, with
Austria calling for a ban while France, Germany, and the UK remaining
either sceptical towards the ban or opposing it (CSKR 2020). Within the
global system of governance, the UNSC stands out as 'the most
structurally unequal body' (Ruhlman 2015: 37--38). Though enjoying the
right of interference in internal affairs of states with humanitarian
services and a broad right of initiative, the ICRC lacks credible
enforcement mechanisms, particularly outside of conflict and crisis
zones (ICRC 2011). [The stratified global arms transfer and production
system, which only emerges in the domain of AWS, usually enables
dominant producers and suppliers to manipulate arms transfers and
related dependencies for political ends]{.underline} (Krause 1992:
99--126 and 206--210; Kinsella 1998: 19). With minor exceptions,
[strategic partnerships run through]{.underline} the Shanghai
Cooperation Organization, the Gulf Cooperation Council, [the
**[N]{.mark}**orth-**[A]{.mark}**tlantic **[T]{.mark}**reaty
**[O]{.mark}**rganization]{.underline}, the OSCE, the EU, and beyond
[also account for certain degrees of dependence and followership,
particularly between smaller and greater states]{.underline} (Cooper,
Higgott, and Nossal 1991). [As the experience with nuclear weapons has
shown and as now evident with killer robots, non-allied states tend to
join humanitarian disarmament or prohibition agendas]{.underline} (Sauer
and Reveraert 2018: 442). [In fact, the Non-Aligned Movement has taken
an active role in lobbying for prohibitions and regulations in the issue
area of AWS]{.underline} (CSKR 2020). States may, to various extents, be
in control of the commercial sector too. For example, China's national
strategy of 'civil-military fusion' leaves little freedom for big
companies to conduct business independently from the state (Verbruggen
2019: 340). Another example is Russia. Most of Russia's national
corporations and companies that are at the forefront of AI development
are, to a considerable extent, under state ownership (Kremlin.ru 2019).
Both cases testify to the model of a 'developmental state' as understood
by political economists (Woo-Cumings 1999).

[**[To warrant and sustain their controversial stance on AWS]{.mark}**,
ban-resisting actors engage in]{.underline} what Sauer and Reveraert
(2018: 446--447) call ['stigma rejection'. They **[recognize the stigma
but detach themselves from it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [For example,
[both **Russia** and the **US** highlight]{.mark} the [**preservation of
a meaningful human element** in their **AI-oriented military
projects**]{.mark}]{.underline} (TASS 2018; BBC 2019). [The US
furthermore insists that, even in the event of degraded or lost
communications, tele-operated systems should not be capable of
autonomously selecting and engaging targets]{.underline} (DoD
2012/2017). Following the same course, the UK has also underlined the
significance of human direction for the application of lethal force
(Country Statement 2018b). [**China** has even called for a ban on the
use of fully autonomous weapons]{.underline} (CSKR 2020). [The
[**language** of human 'involvement',]{.mark} 'judgement', 'control',
and 'responsibility' has generally been agreed upon and formally
[codified]{.mark}]{.underline} at the CCW (CCW 2018, 2019a).
[**[However]{.mark}**, the question of [**norm compliance** remains
**shrouded in ambiguity**]{.mark}, **[chosen by ban-resisting actors as
an effective strategy to reconcile normative pressure and preference for
strategic flexibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}. During CCW GEE
discussions, Russia has repeatedly requested to cut down on unnecessary
details in the final report, especially when there has been no consensus
or sufficient evidence. The US has in turn expressed concerns at the
rigid concept of 'human control' (Acheson 2018; Acheson and Pytlak
2019). China's diplomatic position on AWS can also be characterized by a
degree of 'strategic ambiguity'. This is evident, for instance, in its
recent position papers and its national strategy of 'civil-military
fusion' (Kania 2018). At the same time, it opposes a ban on the
development or production of AWS (CSKR 2020). The situation is similar
with private companies [[in the **US**, **Russia**, **China**]{.mark},
Israel, [**Europe**, and beyond]{.mark}. **[While explicit about how
human control is ensured]{.mark}**, some **[continue working on
tech]{.mark}**nologies **[relevant to AWS]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Quite
a few do so even without clear, at least clearly declared, policies
concerning the question of human control (PAX 2019: 5--8). [On top of
that, ban-resisting actors have simultaneously resorted to what might be
termed **'counter-stigmatization'**]{.underline} (Sauer and Reveraert
2018: 446--447). [Often backed by knowledge-based **expertise**, they
have tried to shift attention to the positive value of AWS]{.underline}
(Country Statement 2018a, 2018b, 2019). Robert Work, former US Deputy
Secretary of Defense, once argued: 'AI will make weapons more
discriminant and better, less likely to violate the laws of war, less
likely to kill civilians, less likely to cause collateral damage'
(Fryer-Biggs 2019). A clear indication of expert support is, for
example, that the Berlin Statement was not endorsed unanimously at the
experts' workshop in Berlin (ICRAC n.d.). Referring to computer
scientist Ronald C. Arkin, Lucas (2014) also assumed that autonomous
robotic technology might 'render war itself, and the conduct of armed
hostilities, less destructive, risky, and indiscriminate'. Many other
frequently raised arguments against the ban are presented in Chapter 4.

As demonstrated, sheer politico-economic power is not enough: gaps in
this realm can to some extent be overcome by other structures of power
(discursive tools, normative pressure, moral authority, etc.). [Through
the latter, norm entrepreneurs are able to generate normative 'hooks' in
the configuration of power, and such 'hooks' are emerging to frame AWS.
**[Manifestations of self-restraint on the part of ban-resisting
actors]{.mark}** testify to this]{.underline}. [However, despite the
broad reach and thriving appeal of the pro-ban movement, their
discourses and practices **cannot curb ban-resisting
actors**]{.underline} at this moment. [Politically and economically
dominant states still possess credible leverage grips to [**mobilize
opposition** to the **stigmatization** and **prohibition of
AWS**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Institutional power: Diplomatic impasse and absence of legal
encapsulation

In this part, it is shown how the aforementioned dynamics eventually
play out in the production of legal commitments. This section serves to
demonstrate that institutional power is largely, yet not exclusively, a
product of other power relations. Conceptually, we offer insight into
the mediatory power of involved institutions and the nature of indirect
interactions among the key stakeholders. Decisional rules, lines of
involvement and responsibility, as well as configurations of
pathdependence are taken into consideration. In practical terms, the
focus is on how pro-ban actors can influence or control other,
especially ban-resisting, actors via institutional loci.

The CCW has firmly established itself as a humanitarian law instrument
and an international forum for addressing the problematic of weapons,
including AWS regulation (UNODA 2014). The practice of successfully
adopted protocols on BLW, explosive remnants of war, non-detectable
fragments, and other devices has set procedural and path-dependence
characteristics of this negotiation format. Such prohibitive practices
have a standard-setting function going far beyond a particular treaty
(Rappert 2008; Acheson and Fihn 2013). Having broadened their scope to
address AWS, CCW discussions were originally held in the format of
informal expert meetings but gained a 'formal status' by moving to the
GGE format (Rosert and Sauer 2020: 17). Over a hundred nations are state
parties to the CCW, including all five permanent members of the UNSC
(CSKR 2018b). The UN's CCW framework has brought together its state
parties and other states, UN agencies, (regional) IOs, the ICRC, and
other registered (I)NGOs, including the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots,
to address AWS (UNODA 2014; CSKR 2018b). Campaigners acknowledge that it
has been a 20-year practice of meaningful (I)NGO participation in such
sessions (CSKR n.d.). The history of the ICRC and the UN working
together is even more deeply rooted (Fortin 2012). To clarify the
position by the ICRC: it has underlined the importance of human
responsibility over decisions to kill, thereby granting diplomatic
support to the pro-ban movement within the UN (ICRC 2016). Informal
meetings between civil society and diplomats have additionally been
arranged under UN auspices (CSKR n.d.). A close relationship between the
UNHRC and the CCW is admitted in view of the linkage between IHRL and
IHL (Bieri and Dickow 2014: 3; CCW 2015: 19). Experts, academics,
researchers, and analysts have also gained a firm seat in the CCW
negotiation format as recent reports also testify to (e.g., CCW 2019a).
Scientists, academics, and political, military, legal, economic, and
technical specialists have also appeared among governmental
representatives along with ministers, secretaries, ambassadors,
counsellors, and attachés (e.g. CCW 2019b).

Deeply embedded within this multi-voice institutional composition, the
issue of AWS has not become institutionalized via a working
international security regime. Progress in the CCW has largely been
hampered by its tradition of consensus voting and lowest common
denominator outcomes. Besides that, the GGE's mandate has generally been
weak. Its principal goal has always been to discuss the matter and
report to the CCW. The GGE has never been authorized to arrange formal
negotiations for a new CCW protocol, even though it has recently been
tasked to consider 'aspects' of a prospective legal framework on AWS in
2020 and 2021 (Rosert and Sauer 2020: 17). There also lack enforcement
mechanisms in the CCW format (Abramson 2017).

As a result, there is no legal instrument to govern the emerging field
of AWS (as of 1 September 2021). The current GGE process might be
characterized as 'going slow and aiming low' (Rosert and Sauer 2020:
17). In line with the cases of APL and CM (Hynek 2018b), these are
mainly dominant powers that have blocked the ban proposal (CSKR 2020).
As R&D and governmental spending accelerate in the field of AWS (Haner
and Garcia 2019), little progress and even a degree of regress can be
observed in the GGE. The diplomatic language of a few countries,
including the US, Russia, and Israel, is firmly fixed on the 'benefits'
of AWS (Acheson 2018: 1). Some states criticized the GGE process for the
lack of ambition and urgency as early as in 2017 (Acheson 2017: 4). The
US, Russia, and Israel have even tried to remove explicit references to
'human control' -- the central issue in the AWS debate since 2014 --
from the GGE's latest reports (Acheson 2018: 7--8; Acheson and Pytlak
2019: 5--6). While the phrase still appears repeatedly in the 2018
report, there are barely any references to it in the 2019 report. On
balance, the most recent report introduces a new guiding principle:
'\[h\]uman-machine interaction, which may take various forms and be
implemented at various stages of the life cycle of a weapon' (CCW 2018,
2019a). This provision may implicitly create space for the lawful use of
AWS: the key would be to ensure that the system effectuates human intent
when using force. More flexibility is given by the lack of a precise
definition of AWS and a clear understanding of the relevant concepts and
characteristics after six years of CCW discussions.

Increasingly frustrated with the CCW format, pro-ban actors have already
begun thinking about moving the process to another venue (Bieri and
Dickow 2014: 3). The UNGA or an alternative ad hoc forum seem to be 'the
only legitimate spaces where progress is possible' (Acheson and Pytlak
2019: 2). Other successful treaties have demonstrated that the UNSC
resistance is not necessarily decisive (Johnson, n.d.). For example, the
Arms Trade Treaty or the Nuclear Weapon Ban Treaty clearly testify to
the utility of the UNGA in building up international regimes. The UNGA
might also be an option for AWS, especially now that regular
issue-oriented deliberations at the UNGA First Committee on Disarmament
and International Security have complemented the CCW procedure (UNGA
2018). Recalling the Ottawa (APL) and Oslo (CM) processes, there is also
a real possibility for lesser powers led by patrons, typically middle
powers, to bypass conventional arms control for an ad hoc regime (Hynek
2018b). However, neither of these options is favourable in the case of
AWS, at least as of now. The UNGA upholds the principle of equality, and
-- on top of that -- the five permanent memberstates of the UNSC
maintain the right to veto decisions concerning international peace and
security (Ruhlman 2015: 37--38). With only China inclined towards a
limited ban at the most, all of the five oppose the all-embracing ban on
the use, development, and production of AWS (CSKR 2020). However, the
pro-ban movement lacks not only influential members but also state
members in general. This makes it much harder for them to generate any
meaningful legal outcomes at the UNGA or an alternative ad hoc forum.
Their coalition also lacks active middle powers whose leading role
proved significant in previous norm-setting processes: Sweden on BLW,
Canada on APL or Norway on CM (Rosert and Sauer 2020: 17--18).

To sum up, [pro-ban actors yet remain institutionally powerless in the
face of competing (mainly great powers') interests]{.underline}.
[**[Pursuing the process via an alternative ad hoc forum]{.mark}** is
also highly demanding, especially when there is little support from
diplomatically influential governments]{.underline}. Benvenisti and
Downs (2007: 595-- 597) would interpret the case as the post-Cold War
[trend of institutions working along 'functionalist lines',
[mak]{.mark}ing [it **more convenient for powerful states** and **more
challenging for weaker states** to bargain]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Discussion and a way forward

The chapter sheds light on the complex workings of power around the
security issue of AWS. We drew attention to the legal backdrop and
political advancements that jointly point towards international security
regulation of AWS and discerned that the legal underbrush applicable for
managing AWS is yet restricted. This is because it principally features
general international laws of war, in particular humanitarian
principles, and the piecemeal emerging framework regulating
cyberweapons. We then demonstrated how, given these limitations, the
issue-oriented prohibitionary agenda has deeply penetrated the political
scene cutting across global, regional, and local levels. The opening
section concludes that, despite the success of 'severe politicization',
AWS have not become truly 'securitized': the issue has neither moved
beyond standard political procedures nor culminated in the adoption of
issue-oriented, extraordinary measures. The power-analytical approach is
then utilized and refined, with the nexus between ethics and law
interpreted, to address the case. It serves to reflect on the dynamics
and conditions influencing the prospects of outlawing AWS, as well as
the ethical and legal intensity of the emerging regulatory framework.
Attempts at establishing a global prohibition regime on AWS and the
existing resistance to this are brought into sharp focus, and the main
findings are graphically synthesized (Figure 6.2).

This analysis begins with the notion of productive power and dissects
discourses and counter-discourses related to the stigmatization of AWS.
It shows how both deontological and consequentialist arguments are used
to frame AWS as immoral, unethical, illegal, and inhumane military
instruments, and even as a threat to humankind. The imagery of killer
robots is additionally utilized to build a horrifying, and withal
graphic, representation of AWS. The standard of civilization is also
recalled by pro-ban actors to assist in this framing. Not only does it
help them to portray AWS as uncivilized, but political subjects are also
differentiated on this basis into the ingroup of civilized actors and
the outgroup of barbarians. We eventually argue that a nascent stigma is
emerging in association with AWS, yet more a 'politicized' rather than
actual category of weapons at the moment. Building upon broader ethical
forces and humanitarian dispositifs, it targets the removal of human
control from the use of force. The tradition of legal grafting
(progressively embedding ethical codes in more and more weapons
treaties) is seen as spilling over to the studied case with an
incentivizing and facilitatory effect. However, we conclude that the
prohibition discourse has not become a dominant regime of truth, at
least as of now. Powerful oppositional narratives exist in no small part
due to the lack of a meaningful material basis under the stigmatization
of killer robots. They feature positive strategic-military implications
of AWS and reveal the flaws of the prohibition discourse. Since ethical
forces and humanitarian dispositifs are an important general condition
for issue-specific discourses, competing narratives maintain a positive
ethical and legal profile of AWS. Ethical artefacts that emerge in such
debates form the basis for subsequent legal arguments and,
prospectively, new legal principles and norms. Acceleration and
increasing investments in AWS R&D, embedded in the global structure of
arms production and transfers, set the whole process in motion.

Marginally touched upon in the previous section, structural power is our
next analytical focus. Through its lens, we demonstrate how the
structural position of pro-ban actors is disadvantaged in the prevailing
systemic distribution of power and associated interests. To still
emphasize a very high calibre of their composition, heterarchies of
power underpinning the pro-ban movement are depicted. It becomes clear,
however, that both pro-ban and ban-resisting actors enjoy state and
public support, facilitation by (elements of) IOs, expert blessing, and
commercial sector endorsement. The dynamics of arms production and trade
are found to have been particularly influential in shaping the profile
of ban resistance. They have affected political decision-making on the
part of weapons-dependent governments, including dominant producers and
suppliers as well as arms recipients, and spotlighted the role of the
commercial sector. It is highlighted that economically dominant actors
largely correspond to politically dominant actors in the UN system of
governance (the P5). The key finding of this analysis is that a divided
social stance in relation to AWS has not favoured the pro-ban movement.
While the latter commands knowledge production on par with ban-resisting
actors, it cedes control over the sphere of security, technological
know-how, finance, and material production to them. The intensity of the
gradient shade, which is even for the terrain of knowledge and uneven
for the other ones, graphically nuances this (Figure 6.2).

Next, attention is directed towards the working of compulsory power.
Here, we analyse how ban-resisting actors maintain their structural
dominance and freedom to continue investing in AWS, and how ban
advocates may steer their behaviour in the desired direction. Having
analysed how normative arguments are translated into normative
strategies, we found that structurally disadvantaged actors can harness
their moral authority and to some extent overcome gaps in
politico-economic power. The key mechanisms of direct influence utilized
by the pro-ban movement include tabooization of AWS, naming and shaming,
as well as persuasion via normative and peer pressure on multiple
fronts. We draw a clear connection between their hybrid moral thrust and
the emergence of normative 'hooks' working to constrain the freedom of
AWS R&D. While civil society engagement and increasing public awareness
are positive developments, their efforts have so far proved not enough
to change the present course of affairs. Their [discursive and practical
strategies still concede to resistant great powers'
counter-strategies]{.underline}. Leverage maintained by the UNSC in the
global system of governance is unparalleled, compared to any other
intergovernmental architecture. What reinforces the position of its
members is political support by other, typically smaller and less
technologically developed, states characterized by certain degrees of
politico-economic dependence and followership. The commercial sector may
also not have much freedom to manoeuvre, especially if governmental
agencies work in close coordination with private companies. The obvious
example is China where there is hardly any room for dissent against the
central government. [**To warrant and sustain their controversial stance
on AWS**, ban-resisting actors **address the emerging stigma as
inapplicable to them** but often **resort to strategic ambiguity to
maintain flexibility**]{.underline}. [[Backed by **knowledge-based
expertise**, they]{.mark} also [engage in **counter-stigmatization** to
**keep the door open -- just slightly -- for lawful uses of
AWS**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What follows is an inquiry into mechanisms of institutional power. The
diplomatic impasse at the CCW is discovered. We recognize that ban
advocates have become deeply embedded with the UN system of governance,
including the CCW. Non-state actors -- including (I)NGOs,
representatives of the Campaign, the ICRC, scientists, academics, as
well as political, military, legal, economic, and technical specialists
-- may access and influence institutional processes. What reinforces
their institutional position is support by a group of (like-minded)
governments, but also endorsement by certain elements of IOs such as the
UNHRC, the UNSG, the EP, and the OSCEPA. However, the consensus rule
within the CCW format, combined with the P5's implicit power to
influence outcomes, renders pro-ban actors virtually powerless in the
face of competing, mainly great powers', interests. There are
alternative options to pursue the process: as other weapons treaties
have shown, success might be reached at the UNGA or an ad hoc forum.
However, the UNGA principle of equality and blocking moves by UNSC
vetobearing members may be detrimental to further progress within the
UN. The lack of influential governments and sufficient mass of aligned
states on the side of the pro-ban movement keeps conditions unfavourable
for bypassing conventional arms control fora at this moment.
[Restrictions adopted athwart the opposition by dominant institutional
players -- largely corresponding to dominant producers of
AWS]{.underline} -- may [still appear to be ineffective]{.underline}.
This is also due to the lack of direct leverage potentially available to
influence or control such non-signatories outside of institutional loci.
Certain degrees of (informal) [**[norm adherence by ban-resisting
actors]{.mark}** might even **[further delay progress on legal
commitments, and especially a ban]{.mark}**, in the issue area [of
**AWS**]{.mark}]{.underline}. So can the inability to agree upon a clear
definition of AWS for regulatory purposes.

#### Securitizing LAWS is self-defeating

5.2 Between LAWS and weapons 'in the area of LAWS'

5.2.1 Threatening entity

This section examines how LAWS are presented as a threat or security
issue in the material. Furthermore, to which extend LAWS are not
securitized or portrayed as threatening, in which a discourse of
progress and growth play a role. The threats or vulnerabilities that
lethal autonomous weapon systems create are linked to different thematic
clusters and discourses. They can be summarised under key themes of
technological discourse and threat of other actors, a military threat.

Firstly, an important aspect in the construction of a threat in LAWS
identified in the material is a cluster which will be referred to here
as a new technology discourse. In this discourse, rapid technological
advances are perceived as a security issue. The term new technology
appears repeatedly in the material, though not always associated with
linguistic means of threat production, but it is characterised as a
discourse concerned with technological development. Where new technology
is variously clustered with terms as: "cyber attacks" (E1) a "new
technological age" (E2), "Hackers" (E1; E8)) and consequential terms
such as "miscalculation"(E2), "manipulation"(E1), "misuse"(E1). To
demonstrate this discourse element, I will use various examples from the
material:

> New technologies are far more susceptible to proliferation,
> manipulation and misuse that conventional weapons. Hackers don´t need
> much more that a computer in order to carry out cyber attacks. (E1)
>
> The second big driver of change and new technologies the topic of our
> conference today autonomous weapons systems have created the fear of
> killer robots that attack targets without human control. Cyber-attacks
> on critical infrastructure could paralyse entire countries. And while
> attribution remains difficult, retaliation could easily provoke
> unintended conflicts. (E2, cursive by me)

These quotes exemplify the threatening or concerning discourse around
new technology. In the first quote the threat is enacted in temporal and
special terms of proximity, an 'attack' could occur at any moment
inflicting some sort of personal harm as nothing more than a computer is
needed. In the second quote, the modality marker 'could' contributes to
the creation of an ominous threat. The source is not known or a 'killer
robot without human control'. All these construe images of speed,
devastating effects, and imminence toward the recipient of the message.

> killer robots that Lord over life and death on the basis of autonomous
> datasets and entirely beyond human control are already a frightening
> real prospect today (...) fully autonomous weapons are susceptible to
> manipulation and also to miscalculation. Automatic escalations -
> 'flash wars' - and arms races are virtually inevitable. This is
> therefore a red line that we must not cross we are committed to this
> in Geneva \[and\] We need your support for this. (E1)

Here, the metaphor of a red line is invoked concerning autonomous
weapons systems, which is commonly used to symbolize a point of no
return. Additionally, in the speech, analogies are used to induce fear.
Analogies are often used to illustrate a threat, creating a link between
a current crisis and a past situation in which neglect led to the
fulfilment of the threat scenario (Cap, 2017).

For example, in the 2019 speech, a link between the current crisis of
technological developments and their possible impact on warfare to the
discoveries of the German chemist Fritz Haber is made. Besides paving
the way for "mass production of artificial fertilizers" (E1) which saved
countless lives, Haber is known as the "father of gas warfare" (E1).
Therefore, the example exemplifies the potential as well as threat
emanating from new technologies.

The linguistic creation of a threat emanating from LAWS and new
technologies is more pronounced in the speeches of Foreign Minister Maas
than in the small inquiries and the material of the CCW. An observation
that coincides with the fact the speech genre functions in a broad
category in which the speech is argumentative and supposed to entertain
and persuade (Fairclough, 1995). While the statements from the CCW and
the small inquiries fall more strongly in a category that is more
argumentative, in which the text serves to inform and persuade. The
statements for the CCW are published in an environment in which what is
said is very controlled and the content is intertextually linked to
prior statements which as Fairclough argues, signals continuity of
discourse practices (Jorgensen & Phillips, 2002).

The threat discourse of new technologies closely links the threat of
LAWS with a discourse of cyber threat. The perception of cyber space as
a threat environment has developed in Germany in recent decades. Cyber
security became part of the public debate in Germany in the early 1990s.
Yet, it was not strongly perceived as a threat until the early 2000s
with the fear of the Millennium, bug. Then the terror attacks of 9/11
led to increased attention to various security risks. These included
cyber security. In Germany, the cyber threat is particularly perceived
in connection to the protection of personal data. Besidesthe event of
9/11, especially Edward Snowden led to increased public attention.
Snowden\'s disclosure of the US National Security Agency (NSA) documents
led to the increased relevance of cyber security. It raised the threat
perception in the general public in 2013 (Schallbruch & Skierk, 2018).
Sandywell (2006) suggests that post 9/11 new technology and especially
the cyber space caused new insecurities through a blurring of the
boundary between the physical and virtual, the global/regional. Where
"states of emergency settle into a condition of permanent societal
instability" (p.48). That these insecurities create a field in which the
extreme manifestations of the cyber threat are linked to the threat
discourse of global terrorism. Sandywell (2006) suggests that both
discourses are marked with boundary dissolving characteristics, which
have intrusive attributes. Further,that the blurring of common and
familiar binaries suggests a more general state of emergency. On the
textual level, the temporal and spatial boundaries are dissolved, and
the threat is emanating from an unknown intrusive other (Sandywell,
2006). It is this sociocultural context that the threat of new
technologies and risk perception of LAWS is linked with within Germany.

A second theme or cluster of threats in which LAWS is embedded is the
threat of 'other actors' and the changing of capabilities that could
come with LAWS. Particularly, other states and illegitimate actors. As
previously mentioned delegitimization can be used as a counterpart to
underpin own legitimization, which can be enacted through ideas of
difference, negative representations and geographical or cultural
boundaries (Cap, 2017). In the speeches a starker image of the 'other'
is created in representations:

> 'we are urging President Putin (...) to ensure that Russia returns to
> compliance with the INF treaty. Its termination would have grave
> consequences for Europeans\` security. (...) as a result of
> infringements, trust, transparency, and stability which we have built
> up labouredly over decades \[is\] at risk of being forfeited'(E1)
>
> 'Players such a China must also take responsibility for strategic
> stability'(E1)
>
> 'I (...) therefore welcome the willingness shown by the US to conduct
> talks with North Korea on the North Korean nuclear programme'(E1)

These quotes while taken out of direct context serve to demonstrate the
creation of images of other states. Russia is represented as
non-compliant 'other' and while the substantives serve as negative
attributions toward Russia, they simultaneously positively represent the
in-groups Europe and Germany. Thus, it reinforces the
mental-geographical boundary of Europe as a whole and its common
identity. Undergirding the call on China is implicit a lack of taking
responsibility for strategic stability. Contrary, the US is portrayed as
positive, willing to conduct talks, while North Korea becomes a passive
other. Therefore, a representation of the world is reinforced with
positive attributes to allies such as the US and representations of
'other' to Russia, North Korea, and China.

The 'other' in terms of states in the CCW material is only visible in
reference to 'potential adversaries'(E8), however, there is a reference
concerning illegitimate actors as "terrorists" (E1; E8), "criminals"
(E1) "illegitimate actors" (E1), and "illegitimate groups" (E9) who are
"expanding their capacity to indiscriminately inflict harm and inflict
terror on civilians" (E8).

There are also consequential threats present in the material which are
in causal relation with the aforementioned threat of 'other actors', the
threat of arms race and arms proliferation. The threat of arms race is
mentioned in different ways. That with the development of LAWS "threat
perceptions are likely to change under the impression that potential
adversaries have or are in the process of acquiring such weapon systems"
(E8, omitting underline) and that "Arms races are under way around the
world" (E1). However, an increase of possible arms race is articulated
as not being limited to the development of LAWS:

> \[In\] the German government\'s assessment, the development of
> autonomous functions for use in weapon systems can further strengthen
> the already existing armament trends. (E18)

Noticeable is that while in the material of the CCW conference the
threat of an arms race is discussed in future terms, it is declared as
already ongoing in the small inquiries and speeches. An image of a
growing threat is generated through increased capacities of other
states, which are, however not named and thus contribute to an ominous
external threat.

Further, a consequential threat of proliferation is articulated. It
relates to illegitimate actors and how "transfer of software" (E8) is
"difficult to prevent and even harder to detect" (E18) and that "the
risk of \[LAWS or predecessor technologies\] uncontrolled proliferation
\[is\] significantly greater than the corresponding risks of
uncontrolled proliferation of finished weapon systems" (E18).
Acknowledgement of the problem is followed by arguments that:

> these concerns are being addressed and regulated by national
> administrative laws, in particular weapon laws and transport and
> traffic law. This enables governments to effectively stop or limit the
> spread of dangerous dual use technologies, if necessary. (E18)

5.2.2 Neoliberal discourse and technocratic view of the arms trade

Juxtaposed with the prior discourse threads are liberal economic
discourse elements. Here, trade and development are central aspects and
that:

> Our focus cannot be on stifling or preventing technological
> development. This would be fatal for a country such as Germany as a
> high-tech location and leading export nation. (E1)

A discourse is visible in which economic interest and the possibility of
growth is central. The aim is toward little restriction in regard to
trade. This suggests a neoliberal discourse, which encourages economic
freedom and interdependence (Navari, 2008). The aim is not to hamper
"scientific progress nor the consideration of the beneficial aspects of
emerging technologies in the area of LAWS for future use" (E9). In this
context of military technology, these statements further reflect a
historical development of the discourse on arms trade and development in
which economic rationale in relation to arms trade "moved to the
forefront" (Hartung, 2008 p.351). Prior to the end of the cold war
arguments of employment were used to loosen restrictions of arms
transfer policy in Germany. This marks a development which increased in
the 90s. While strategic considerations also play a role especially
after 9/11, economic aspects and benefits to Germany´s industry play an
important role (Brzoska, 1989; Hartung, 2008). Therefore, the neoliberal
position in regard to LAWS emphasising development and Germany´s export
position, though not limited to arms trade, continues. The
problematization of arms development and trade is made primarily on
issues in the receiving states, illicit acquisition by states or
individuals such as terrorists or on the problem of weapons of mass
destruction (**[Cooper, 2011]{.underline}**).

5.2.3 An observation of LAWS as the 'other'

Within the aforementioned discourses, we come to an essential factor in
the question of securitisation. That securitisation or de-securitisation
can also be used by securitizing actors. To either lower the
significance or importance given to an issue or to take control over an
issue. By becoming the securitizing actor and therefore being the one to
curb the issue (Buzan et al, 1998; Booth, 2007). After the two parts
above have illuminated the discourses, LAWS are linked with, it is
important to pay attention to the boundary enacted between LAWS and
emerging technologies in the area of LAWS. Thus, between the
illegitimate LAWS and new technologies who lie within the boundary of
the legitimized. The debate around LAWS and their problematisation or
conceptualization as a security issue turn LAWS into the 'other' of
legitimate military technology:

> Germany considers lethal autonomous weapons systems (LAWS) to be
> weapons systems that completely exclude the human factor from
> decisions about their employment. Emerging technologies in the area of
> LAWS need to be conceptually distinguished from LAWS. Whereas emerging
> technologies such as digitalization, artificial intelligence and
> autonomy are integral elements of LAWS, they can be employed in full
> compliance with international law. In Germany´s view, the guiding
> principles \[contribute to\] compliant development, deployment and use
> of emerging technologies in the area of laws. (E17)

This quote exemplifies how emerging technologies can be employed in full
compliance with international law. Thus, in effect that they are
discriminate, precise, and thus humane. However, this delineation
neglects that many of the articulated problematizations above are also
present for weapons in the area of LAWS. Therefore, weapons with
autonomous functions. These include the increased international military
spending, fear of an arms race and problems associated with
proliferation. One might argue that the securitizing actor here has the
constructive role who can decide on the enaction of that boundary
between the legitimate and illegitimate. Deciding on what the reality,
definition and response to LAWS are.

5.3 Action or adoption of distinctive policies

Constructing the above-portrayed threat allows for the creation of
specific policies. The adoption of distinctive policies is a central
concept within the process of securitization. These policy measures do
not have to be exceptional when taking Balzacq's (2016) definition. This
section examines the measures and actions related to reducing the threat
posed by the LAWS contained in the material.

In the material the representations of the measures related to
mitigating the threat move in two broad clusters. One relates to
representations of conduct. Both the construction of conduct between the
governmental entities which have been identified as the securitizing
actors and conduct within war. The second are representations of
measures necessary outside of conflict oftentimes institutionalised
measures.

Representations of conduct between government entities to mitigate the
threat are constructed through calls for "dialogue" (E1; E18), "working
together" (E2), "side by side" (E1) and promoting "transparency" (E1;
E2; E18), "cooperation" (E2) and "sincere political will" (E1). These
are depicted as necessary to address the issue at hand. In these
substantives, the general ideology of 'international community' is
reinforced which also reiterates responsibility to the international
community to address the issue of LAWS. Moreover, these principles
relate to the self-representation and identity ascribed to Germany. It
reinforces their identity of being a 'good' actor. Further, these
identified measures suggest an ideological discourse of liberal peace,
meaning a conception of security integration through the mechanism of
democratization, rule of law and conflict resolution. That security is
achieved through interdependence, cooperation and working together
(Navari, 2008).

A primary representation of necessary conduct within war is adherence to
international humanitarian law (IHL) through "human control" (E21),
that:

> only weapons that are operated in compliance with IHL \[International
> humanitarian law\] are acceptable means of warfare (...) this might
> (...) only be assured as long as humans retain the sufficient control
> at least over the critical functions. (E7)

The modality marker might indicate the degree to which the statement is
valid. It suggests that it is likely, and it can only be assumed that if
humans are retaining sufficient control over critical functions
international law is applied. As discussed previously, the adjective
'sufficient' raises the question of what constitutes human control. To
solve this unclarity a "military code of conduct" (E18; E19) is to be
developed. Undergirding the calls for action of human control and the
military code of conduct specifying the degree of human control is the
ideological discourse of just war. It is visible in the natural
assumption that there are acceptable means of warfare as long as IHL can
be followed. One might argue that it works interdiscursive with the
discourse of liberal peace as in both emphasis is on rule of law
(Navari, 2008).

The second cluster of representations relates to measures outside of
conflict, mainly institutionalised measures. The first is the CCW
conference itself, the second concerns the regulation of weapons.

The international meetings at the CCW are constructed as a measure to
mitigate the threat of LAWS. The Group of Governmental Experts (GGE)
meetings at the CCW "\[contribute\] to an IHL compliant development,
deployment and use of emerging technologies in the area of lethal
autonomous weapons systems" (E18). The status and legitimization of the
CCW are variously constructed, as a platform in which the different
states are "working together" (E2), being cooperative to find a common
solution. The CCW is reiterated in both the Speeches and Small enquiries
as a platform to negotiate LAWS. "The German government considers the
CCW to be the appropriate forum for negotiations on LAWS" (E21) and
that:

> In accordance with the requirements of the coalition agreement14, the
> Federal Government is committed to a worldwide ban on lethal
> autonomous weapons systems (\...) the Federal Government regularly
> pursues this goal in the consultations within the framework of the UN
> Weapons Convention. (E21)

Through such reiteration by voices of authority, of the federal
government and Maas as Foreign Minister the legitimacy of the CCW is
reinforced (Cap, 2017). It suggests that the 'adoption of distinct
policy' is sought within the CCW, transferring the responsibility of
finding policies to address the issue to the international level of the
CCW. However, the status of the CCW is challenged which is visible in
the material of the small inquiries:

> Regardless of the process at international level, is the Federal
> Government planning to take national legal steps to outlaw autonomous
> weapons systems in order to meet the goal of the coalition agreement
> (\...)?
>
> (...) National legal steps to implement the requirements of the
> coalition agreement are (\...) not planned. (E19)

This quote reveals several relations in the material. Firstly, an
oppositional relation between parliamentarians to government but also a
hierarchical relation of the form of communication. The idiom
'regardless of' signifies a dismissal of the international level and
holds the government accountable for action. It suggests the parliament
as one of the audiences whose agreement is necessary for the
intersubjective process of a securitizing move. However, it is not
recognizable whether such an agreement is reached within the material.
The parliamentarians can pose questions through the small inquiries but
cannot go into further detail if something is answered unsatisfactorily.
This is visible in another question within a small inquiry:

> What measures have been and are being taken by the previous and
> current federal government (...) to meet the goal formulated since
> 2013 in the respective coalition agreements (...) of outlawing fully
> autonomous weapons systems? Please list the concrete measures at
> national, European and international level. (E19)

While the answer by the government contains a reference to the CCW and
its process as well as investments into research, national and European
measures are omitted. In the material, an intertextual chain is visible
between the material of the CCW which then is reiterated in replies of
the German government to the small inquiries of parliamentarians. It
shows that the German government draws on in the CCW established
meanings to the topic of LAWS.

Moreover, there are various calls for the promotion of "arms control
regimes and disarmament" (E1), "global arms control" (E2), and "respect
certain rules and limitations" (E2) in the material. That:

> Arms control regimes and disarmament have always started with the
> realisation that they have the capacity to contain rivalries and
> security policy and preserve mutual interests more effectively. (E1)

While this discourse of arms control and disarmament is visible in
Maas\`s speeches, there is no application visible concerning specific
legal measures of arms control concerning the topic of LAWS. Merely,
that to ensure compliant development of technologies "weapon reviews"
(E12; E17; E18) should be conducted by the states. Reference to weapon
review bords is made both in the material of the CCW and the small
inquiries. These form a national institutionalised mechanism of control
which is conducted by each state with individual criteria and are
supposed to ensure the applicability of IHL for new means of warfare. In
the material of the CCW, various actions are proposed to curb the
challenges regarding LAWS. "Options (...) ranging from a legally binding
instrument (...) to no regulation at all \[and\] Germany \[recommending
to\] workout the elements of political commitment to take the form of a
declaration, middle ground so to speak" (E14). To "build consensus on
elements of a normative and operational framework (\...) on the topics
of human responsibility, accountability and human-machine interaction"
(E16). In these representations, the construction of a 'common' solution
is reinforced with Germany´s proposal of a political declaration as
being a 'middle ground'. Visible in this section is the tension between
global/local, national/international distinctions when it comes to
action and the adoption of distinctive policies present in the material.
This is reflected in how on the international level emphasis is on
'common' solutions and 'consensus' while the nationally implemented
weapons review bords as institutional control mechanisms highlight the
heterogeneity of the different actors as their specific implementation
varies (Sohm, 2018).

In light of the discourse promoting arms control and regulation on the
textual level, this section will consider the wider context and what
economic and regulatory conditions these are juxtaposed with in Germany.
Beginning with arms control and regulation mechanism as well as
Germany´s contribution to the global arms trade.

As previously mentioned, Germany is one of the major arms exporters
worldwide. Regarding the export practices, researchers found a
discrepancy between the normative policy statements of the German
government and actual export permits allowed by the national security
council. It is argued that human rights considerations are put aside for
strategic and economic export decisions (Platte & Leuffen, 2016:
Grässlin, 2013). This ties into the previously decerned historical
discourse in which economic rationale for arms trade and development
moved to the forefront. In the last ten years, civil society actors in
Germany have uncovered important cases of deficiencies in arms export
control mechanisms. Concerning the tracking of exported goods and
violations of the export permits in the destined countries. This
revealed gaps within the arms trade control within Germany for
conventional weapons. The civil society actors triggered investigations
later taken up by the public prosecutor's office15 (SWR, 2021; Dorsch,
2018). Technologies significant for LAWS or weapons in the area of LAWS
are often dual-use and for their autonomy, software is decisive16. The
control of dual-use is conducted by the European Dual-Use Regulation
(Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, 2018). Since 2016 the
European Union negotiated to review the legal framework for dual-use
goods to increasingly include digital technologies. However, this was a
five-year negotiation process and many civil society actors believe that
the outcome does not provide sufficient guarantees for "human right and
security across the EU" (Krapiva, 2021; Fanta, 2020). An important aim
however is the announcement to increase transparency in the publicised
export lists by each country. As of now, no real informative value is in
the German dual-use report causing it to attract little public
attention. Lurz (2021) claims that is because no distinction is made
between military and civilian use of the exported goods within the
published dual-use list of Germany and only the number and value of
licences by country are listed (A. Lurz, personal communication,
February 10, 2021). The newly announced transparency could contribute to
increased public oversight. In both dual-use exports and arms trade,
there is strong economic interest visible in Germany. Germany ranks on
spot 4, on global arms exports with a share of about 17%, and
additionally, an estimated 50- 60% of Europe's dual-use exports are from
Germany (Stolton, 2020; SIPRI yearbook, 2020). Transparency is needed to
better study these economic factors and to be able to scientifically
assess other actors relevant to LAWS such as arms companies. Inflexible
regulatory frameworks are opposite to what Surabhi (2019) calls "a buzz
\[of potential benefits from technologization of military operations\]
around which private companies are hurdling, to develop AI, thereby
diversifying the constellation of manufacturers who have traditionally
been associated with the weapons industry" (p.46).

Moreover, the calls on arms control and disarmament are located in the
context of new military defence projects. Such as the EU initiative of
the European Defence Found (EDF) and the EU agency Frontex. The EDF was
allocated a budget of close to 8 billion between 2021-2027, whereby 2.7
billion are allocated to defence research and 5.3 to capability
development (European Commission, n.d). Moreover, the EU agency
Frontex´s budget has continuously increased since its inception and is
supposed to be allocated a budget of 5,6 billion until 2027 (Monroy,
2021).

The question of regulation and the military defence investments show
that Germany cannot be considered solely within its national environment
but must be considered with the inclusion of the wider context of the
EU.

### L -- Arms Regulation

#### The 1AC's call for arms regulation is [not]{.underline} a neutral or progressive method to control the tools of war\-\--[rather]{.underline} it props up [empire]{.underline} and [liberal militarism]{.underline} by defining [who]{.underline} can legitimately use [which]{.underline} tools of violence 

Neil **Cooper 18**, Professor of International Relations and Security
Studies and Head of Peace Studies & International Development at the
University of Bradford, October 2018, "Race, Sovereignty, and Free
Trade: Arms Trade Regulation and Humanitarian Arms Control in the Age of
Empire," Journal of Global Security Studies, Vol. 3, No. 4, p. 444-462

Consequently, the [[spaces of empire were]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[subject to]{.underline}]{.mark} intensive and [extensive
[efforts to restrict]{.mark} the [trade in arms]{.mark} via import
controls, internal regulation of colonial spaces, and export
controls]{.underline} instituted at key nodal points in regional arms
markets. Thus, rather than being an era of free trade in arms, the late
nineteenth century was characterized by a dual regime of regulation:
general adherence to a peacetime liberal export norm for arms transfers
from imperial metropoles along with intensive and extensive regulation
of arms flows into, within, and between the spaces of Empire.

The Third Matryoshka Doll: The Devil\'s Bargain, Constitutive Norms, and
Arms Control as Governmentality

[[Calls for arms trade regulation]{.mark} in the spaces of empire [were
**rarely located in broader critiques of
militarism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe. [For policymakers, small
arms control]{.underline} in Africa and elsewhere [was [necessitated by
the threat to colonial order and]{.mark} therefore **[distinct
from]{.mark} discussions about armaments policy and [armaments
competition amongst the so-called civilized
powers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even for the campaigners at Brussels,
small arms proliferation was an issue umbilically linked to the
questions of slavery, arms, and liquor control abroad rather than
questions about domestic policy. The Brussels Act was equally distinct
from late nineteenth century attempts to curtail the excesses of war
amongst civilized powers. Some campaigners had certainly called for the
disarmament of Arab traders; the act itself cited the need to "diminish
intestine wars between tribes" (Article II(i)), but such calls were very
much rooted in a humanitarian anti-slavery tradition rather than any
emerging humanitarian law of war tradition. For example, neither
activists nor officials actively sought to frame the Brussels Act in
relation to earlier initiatives such as the 1868 Declaration of St.
Petersburg banning the use of explosive and fulminating bullets or the
1874 Brussels Declaration on the Laws and Customs of War. The
genealogical heritage of the Brussels arms regulations ran through an
anti-slavery tradition rather than a HAC one.

[This is not to deny there were **expressions of discontent from gun
manufacturers** about the impact of colonial restrictions]{.underline}
upon their business.28 [But]{.underline}, both [domestic arms production
and the dynamics of arms rivalry]{.underline} in Europe
[remained]{.underline} largely **[untroubled by efforts at small arms
control in the peripheries]{.underline}**. Indeed, in 1889, the British
government launched a new program of military shipbuilding and both
France and Russia followed suit. According to Laity (2001, 114) "[a new
arms race was underway"---and at the very same moment, diplomats were
concluding]{.underline} the Brussels [restrictions on small arms
proliferation]{.underline}.

Of course, a decade after the Brussels Conference, the Tsar called the
first Hague Peace Conference to explore a "possible reduction of the
excessive armaments which weigh upon all nations" (Keefer 2006, 7). In
the end, though, the Hague Conference achieved little on this front.
Salisbury, who had been so eloquent about the Brussels Conference,
observed that the expense and destructiveness of war had worked as a
deterrent in solving conflicts (ibid., 10)---disarmament, humanitarian
or otherwise, was for savages, not for civilized powers. Indeed, British
military experts also argued any attempt to freeze armament levels
risked favoring "the interests of savage nations" (Cooper 1991, 125). At
the Hague Conference itself, even a call for a ceiling on the growth of
armaments met with failure (Keefer 2006, 14), and the best the delegates
could agree on was a nonbinding resolution noting the restriction of
military budgets was desirable (Best 1999, 631; Keefer 2006, 15). Modest
calls for limitations on the development of rifles, gunpowder, and
explosives were rebuffed, although restrictions were imposed on dum-dum
bullets and some technologies still in their infancy. The second Hague
Conference of 1907 achieved even less (Sidorowicz 1992, 15). As Sandi
Cooper (1991, 132) has noted, "arms reduction had been entombed again."

Even more instructively, the first Hague Conference was convened in the
very same year as the 1899 agreement between Britain and Egypt
establishing a joint condominium over the Sudan. This had been preceded
by the battle of Omdurman in which five hours of fighting had left
11,000 Mahdists dead in comparison to just 40 on the British side
(Headrick 1981, 118). Back in Britain, The Morning Post (September 29,
1898) highlighted the role played by "the powerful weapons of
civilization---the shrapnel shell, the magazine rifle and the Maxim
gun." Winston Churchill (1902, 300) recorded "the most signal triumph
ever gained by the arms of science over barbarians." Unsurprisingly
perhaps, the advantage provided by the "weapons of civilisation" was
duly recognized in the Sudan Agreement. Article 12 noted that "special
attention shall be paid to the enforcement of the Brussels Act of the
2nd July, 1890, in respect to the import, sale and manufacture of
firearms and their munitions" (ibid., 373). As this example illustrated,
[[qualitative arms control functioned to **underpin**]{.mark} **the
capacity to deploy [violence in]{.mark} the [service of empire, not
constrain it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Brussels Act therefore
represented an early version of the "devil\'s bargain" highlighted by
Krause (see above, pX), in which [[a prohibitory]{.mark} HAC [norm is
**promoted at the cost of legitimizing**]{.mark} **the logics and
practices of [liberal militarism]{.mark} both [at home and
abroad]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

However, [focusing only on the operation of prohibitory regulatory norms
obscures the way arms trade regulation also constituted a specific
colonial form of arms control as governmentality, whereby [mechanisms of
prohibition]{.mark}]{.underline} and prescription [[were]{.mark} both
put to the service of [governing **which peoples could legitimately use
what**]{.mark} **kinds of [arms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course,
[[efforts to manage arms flows]{.mark} to potentially unruly colonial
subjects [by]{.mark} constantly [seeking to balance permission and
proscription were **neither**]{.mark} **completely [effective
nor]{.mark} ever effectively [complete]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First,
[efforts at restraint were perennially subject to strategies of
evasion]{.underline} undertaken [by local actors]{.underline} operating
with their own normative and cartographic understandings (Tagliacozzo
2005; Mathew 2016). Second, [arms trade regulation was a contested
terrain over which advocates of permission and advocates of restraint
often clashed]{.underline}. For example, pressures for restraint were
offset by pressures to use the provision of arms to secure access to
markets and the loyalty or security of allies in a context of
intra-European competition to maintain and expand formal and informal
empires (Grant 2007; Chew 2012). **[[Policy on the
ground]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, [**often [appeared
contradictory]{.mark}**. Nevertheless, [proponents]{.mark}]{.underline}
of permission and proscription generally [[agreed]{.mark} on the broad
goals of policy---[to **maintain imperial influence and**]{.mark}
**imperial [order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As will be illustrated below,
[they agreed even more on the **broader logics in which arguments for
permission and proscription were to be located**]{.underline}---[those
governing sovereignty, free trade, development, and the standard of
civilization]{.underline}.

For example, the Brussels Act certainly failed to prevent a substantial
arms trade into Abyssinia and Somalia where, by 1908, British officials
considered the act had "completely broken down"29 largely as a result of
French support for a profitable arms trade through French-controlled
Djibouti. In this case, colonial norms of sovereignty provided the
regulatory space for proliferation. The legal legitimacy of this transit
trade was enshrined by Article Ten of the Brussels Act, which, somewhat
ironically, had been vigorously promoted by the British. This affirmed
the right of inland territories "under the sovereignty or protectorate"
of another signatory power to acquire arms via the territory of a
coastal power, and Italy had previously announced Abyssinia\'s adhesion
to the agreement. Compounding the irony, at one point in the
negotiations the French had suggested the conference had "no power to
impose a right of transit on any Sovereign state."30

Enforcement of both the arms and slave trade regulations of Brussels was
also hampered by French refusal to permit searches of sea vessels flying
the French flag. Arms smuggling dhow owners operating in both the Red
Sea and the Persian Gulf quickly realized the French flag represented "a
license to traffic" (Mathew 2016, 35), as it made each dhow an "island
of colonial sovereignty" (ibid., 34) and therefore immune to search.
This is not to imply sovereignty norms offered an unfettered license to
trade. The arms provisions of the Brussels Act were ultimately
predicated on the fact that European powers exercised "rights of
sovereignty" (Article Nine) in their colonial possessions. Thus, the act
and its implementation was suffused with norms of sovereignty that both
underpinned restrictions on the arms trade and provided the regulatory
spaces permitting their circumvention.

Similarly, both the advocates for free trade in arms in the spaces of
empire and the advocates of restriction crafted their arguments by
reference to the shared ideational frames of free trade, development,
and the standard of civilization---each heavily imbricated in the other.
In Africa, for example, free trade advocates argued the offer of arms
was essential for recruiting African laborers and that arms
proliferation would speed the depopulation of local wildlife, thus
hastening the day when natives switched from hunting and alcohol to
legitimate trade (Storey 2008, 196). Conversely, proponents of
restriction such as Alexander Mackay (1890, 42) of the Church Missionary
Society deplored the fact that "in the name of Christianity, free trade
and civilization we see firewater and firearms pouring in every port
\[in Africa\]." However, for Mackay, the solution lay not only in
"forbidding the import of arms and ammunition" but in promoting
legitimate trade amongst Africans, "developing the resources of the
country, and . . . promoting internal peace" so "the natives will . . .
busy themselves with growing whatever they can get a fair price for
instead of fighting" (Letter to The Times, May 8, 1889). In this sense,
the Brussels Act represented the archetype of regulation in the spaces
of empire, combining restrictions on the arms and liquor trades with
calls for the development of "agricultural labour and . . . the
industrial arts" amongst native populations (Article Two). At the same
time, the precise ways in which these twin processes of grafting and
counter-grafting played out varied from region to region and over time.
For example, in Singapore, policy from the 1820s onwards oscillated
between permission and proscription, as free trade and merchant pressure
on the one hand and concerns about the destabilizing impact of the
firearms trade on the other hand were weighed in different ways at
different times (Tagliacozzo 2005, 270; Chew 2012, 174--79). At Muscat,
commercial treaties between the sultan and various powers (particularly
the French) enshrining free trade severely hampered Britain\'s ability
to curtail the trade in the Persian Gulf. This was only finally resolved
by the aforementioned 1913 agreement between Britain and France. Thus,
free trade norms were constantly exposed to serial processes of grafting
and counter-grafting. Nevertheless, as the nineteenth century merged
into the early twentieth century, arms trade regulation in the spaces of
empire was increasingly seen as consonant with a dominant imaginary of
liberal market norms (Mathew 2016).

[This is not to downplay the pressures for imperial powers to supply
arms to local allies, or the way broader colonial conceptions of
economic and geostrategic interest militated against cooperation to
limit the arms traffic]{.underline} as at Djibouti and Muscat.31
However, [such factors ultimately illustrate the way in which particular
assemblages of norms]{.underline}, formal and informal practices,
[responses to evasions, and norm-derived conceptions of interest
constituted colonial practices of arms control as
governmentality]{.underline}. Understood in this way, [[oscillations in
policy]{.mark} in the same region]{.underline} or between different
spheres of colonial interest [[reflected the
attempt]{.underline}]{.mark} (always imperfect) [[to manage arms flows
according to]{.mark} where people were placed in [the racially
inflected]{.mark} triple [hierarchies of civilization, loyalty, and
utility to imperial power]{.mark}]{.underline}---[hierarchies that could
be **either mutually reinforcing or mutually opposed depending on
circumstance**. [Pressures to **arm or disarm locals**]{.mark} also
[illustrated how judgements about what constituted interest were
predicated on a]{.mark} particular [moral economy in which]{.mark}
European norms of [racial superiority and imperialism framed the
standards of appropriate behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} of the era
(Finnemore and Sikkink 1998, 892) [and the fluid but always subordinate
identities of the other]{.underline}.

The centrality of European racial and imperial norms in arms governance
was illustrated in the late 1870s when the Cape Colony in Southern
Africa introduced a licensing system aimed at disarming supposedly
disloyal native tribes (Storey 2004, 707). In response, one tribe, the
Basuto, proclaimed their loyalty to the Queen and asked whether "we are
to be disarmed because we are black."32 In British India, Acts in 1858,
1860, 1878, and 1909 constantly refined and revised who had the right to
own, import, export, and produce what kinds of arms, where they could be
transferred to, and under what conditions. Each act was also regularly
amended via a series of notifications that led one official reviewing
rules on exports to Aden to lament "it is impossible to say . . . with
absolute certainty what are now the precise powers of the Government of
India under the \[1878\] Arms Act."33 This illustrates how [[such
regulations were]{.mark} not just about the effective management of arms
flows but also [an **intrinsic part** of the process by which **imperial
gradations of race, culture, and threat were**]{.mark} **actually
[produced]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, in this context, [[the
performative of]{.mark} adherence to, and refinement of, [regulatory
processes was **as important as actually achieving a concrete impact on
arms flows**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The same is true [of the different ways in which **living things** can
be **manipulated**, including the **hybridization** of organic, animal,
and artificial elements]{.underline}. In fact, [there is good reason to
believe that]{.underline} in a more or less distant future [**[genetic
tech]{.mark}**niques [will be used to]{.mark} manage the characteristics
of populations to **[eliminate races judged \"undesirable\"]{.mark}**
through the selection of trisomic embryos, or through theriomorphism
(hybridization with animal elements) or \"cyborgization\" (hybridization
with artificial elements)]{.underline}. [Nor is it impossible to believe
that we will arrive at a point where the **fundamental role of
medicine** will be not only to bring a sick organism back to health but
to use medical techniques of **molecular engineering** to **refashion
life** itself along lines defined by **racial
determinism**]{.underline}. Race and racism, then, do not only have a
past. They also have a future, particularly in a context where the
possibility of transforming life and creating mutant species no longer
belongs to the realm of fiction.

Taken on their own, the transformations of the capitalist mode of
production during the second half of the twentieth century cannot
explain the reappearance and various metamorphoses of the Beast. But
they---along with major discoveries in technology, biology, and
genetics---do undeniably constitute its background. 42 [[A]{.mark} new
**[political economy of life]{.mark}** is emerging, one [irrigated by
**international flows of knowledge about cells, tissues, organs,
pathologies, and therapies**]{.mark} as well as about intellectual
property]{.underline}.43 [[The **reactivation of the logic of
race**]{.mark} also [**goes hand in hand** with the **increasing power
of the ideology of security** and]{.mark} the installation of
**[mechanisms aimed at calculating and minimizing risk]{.mark}** and
turning protection into the currency of citizenship]{.underline}.

This is [notably the case in regard to]{.underline} the management of
migration and mobility in [a context in which **terrorist threats** are
believed to increasingly emanate from individuals organized in cells and
networks that span the surface of the planet]{.underline}. In such
conditions the protection and policing of territory becomes a structural
condition for securing the population. To be effective, such protection
requires that everyone remain at home, that those living and moving
within a given national territory be capable of proving their identities
at any given moment, that the most exhaustive information possible be
gathered on each individual, and that the control of foreigners\'
mobility be carried out not only along borders but also from a distance,
preferably within their countries of departure. [The massive expansion
of digitization under way nearly everywhere in the world partly adheres
to this logic, with the idea that optimal forms of
**[securitization]{.mark}** necessarily [require]{.mark} the creation of
[**global systems of control** over individuals conceived of **as
biological bodies**]{.mark} that are both multiple and in
motion]{.underline}.

[Protection itself is no longer based solely on the legal order. It has
become [a question of **biopolitics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [**new
systems of security** build on]{.mark} various elements of [prior
regimes]{.mark} (the forms of punishment [used within]{.mark}
**[slavery]{.mark}**, aspects of the **[colonial wars]{.mark}** of
conquest and occupation, **legal- juridical** techniques used in the
creation of **[states of exception]{.mark}**) [and **incorporate them,
on a nanocellular level**, into]{.mark} the techniques of the age of
[**genomics** and the **war on terror**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But they
also draw on techniques elaborated during the counterinsurgency wars of
the period of decolonization and the \"dirty wars\" of the Cold
War]{.underline} (in Algeria, Vietnam, Southern Africa, Burma, and
Nicaragua), as well as the experiences of predatory dictatorships put
into power throughout the world with the direct encouragement, or at
least complicity, of the intelligence agencies of the West.

[[The increasing power of the **security state**]{.mark} in the
contemporary context [is]{.mark}]{.underline}, furthermore,
[[accompanied by a **remodeling of the world through
tech**]{.mark}nology [and]{.mark} an **[exacerbation of]{.mark} forms of
[racial categorization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Facing the
transformation of the economy of violence throughout the world,
[**liberal democratic regimes** now]{.mark} consider themselves to be
[in a]{.mark} nearly [**constant state of war** against new
enemies]{.mark} who are in flight, both mobile and
reticular]{.underline}. [The theater of this new form of war is both
[**external** and **internal**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It requires a
\"total\" conception of defense, along [with greater tolerance for
**legal exceptions**]{.mark} and special dispensations]{.underline}.
[The conduct of this type of war [depends on]{.mark} the creation of
tight, **[panoptic systems]{.mark}** that enable increasing control of
individuals, preferably from a distance, via the traces they leave
behind]{.underline}.46 In place of the classic paradigm of war, in which
opposing sides meet on a well-defined battlefield and the risk of death
is reciprocal, the logic is now vertical. There are two protagonists:
prey and predator.47 The predator, with nearly complete control of the
airspace, selects the targets, locations, times, and nature of the
strikes.48 The increasingly vertical character of war and the more
frequent use of unpiloted drones means that killing the enemy looks more
and more like a video game, an experience of sadism, spectacle, and
entertainment.49 And, even more important, [these new forms of
warfare]{.underline} carried out from a distance [require an
unprecedented **[merging]{.mark}** of the [**civil**, **police**, and
**military** spheres with]{.mark} those of
**[surveillance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The spheres of surveillance, meanwhile, are also being reconfigured. No
longer mere state structures, and operating as chains linked in form
only, they function by cultivating private-sector influence, by
expanding into those corporate entities responsible for gathering the
data necessary for mass surveillance. As a result, the objects of
surveillance become daily life, the space of relationships,
communication (notably through electronic technologies), and
transactions. There is not, of course, a total concatenation of the
mechanisms of the market and those of the state. But in our contemporary
world [the **liberal state** is transformed into a **war power** at a
time when]{.underline}, we now realize, [capital not only remains fixed
in a phase of primitive accumulation but also still leverages racial
subsidies in its pursuit of profit]{.underline}.

In this context [the citizen is redefined as both the subject and the
beneficiary of surveillance, [which **now privileges** the
**transcription of biological, genetic, and behavioral
characteristics**]{.mark} through digital imprints]{.underline}. In a
new technetronic regime characterized by miniaturization,
dematerialization, and the fluid administration of state violence,
imprints (fingerprints, scans of the iris and retina, forms of vocal and
facial recognition) make it possible to measure and archive the
uniqueness of individuals. [The **distinguishing parts** of the **human
body** become the foundations for **new systems** of **identification**,
**surveillance**, and **repression**]{.underline}. [The **security
state** conceives of **identity** and the movement of individuals
(including its own citizens) as **sources of danger** and risk. But the
**generalized use of biometric data as a source of identification** and
for the **automation** of facial recognition constitutes a new type of
populace, one predisposed toward distancing and
imprisonment]{.underline}.51 So it is that, in the context of the
anti-immigration push in Europe, entire categories of the population are
indexed and subjected to various forms of racial categorization that
transform the immigrant (legal or illegal) into an essential category of
difference.52 This difference can be perceived as cultural or religious
or linguistic. It is seen as inscribed in the very body of the migrant
subject, visible on somatic, physiognomic, and even genetic levels.53

[[**War** and **race**]{.mark} have meanwhile [become
**resurgent**]{.mark} problems **[at the heart of the international
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The same is true of torture and the
phenomenon of mass incarceration. It is not only that the line between
war and peace has been blurred. War has become a \"gigantic process of
labor,\" while the military regime seeks to impose its own model on the
\"public order of the peace state.\"54 While some citadels have
collapsed, other walls have been strengthened.55 As has long been the
case, the contemporary world is deeply shaped and conditioned by the
ancestral forms of religious, legal, and political life built around
fences, enclosures, walls, camps, circles, and, above all, borders. 56
[Procedures of **differentiation**, **classification**, and
**hierarchization** aimed at **exclusion**, expulsion, and even
**eradication** have been **reinvigorated everywhere**]{.underline}. New
voices have emerged proclaiming, on the one hand, that there is no such
thing as a universal human being or, on the other, that the universal is
common to some human beings but not to all. Others emphasize the
necessity for all to guarantee the safety of their own lives and homes
by devoting themselves-and their ancestors and their memories, in one
way or another-to the divine, a process that only subtracts them from
historical interrogation and secures them completely and permanently
within the walls of theology. Like the beginning of the nineteenth
century, the beginning of the twenty-first constitutes, from this
perspective, a significant moment of division, universal
differentiation, and identity seeking.

### L -- Bioweapons

#### Bio-threats [broaden]{.underline} violent management of life to the [whole population]{.underline} and create a [continuous state]{.underline} of emergency

**Rychnovská 17 --** Dagmar Rychnovská, Department of Security Studies,

Charles University, Czech Republic, "Bio(in)security, Scientific
Expertise, and the Politics of Post-Disarmament in the Biological
Weapons Regime," Geoforum, Volume 84, p. 378-388

The imaginaries of biological threats and the prominence of these issues
on the political agenda of Western governments have undergone major
changes. [[What started to be seen as a security concern has
been]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [a]{.underline} deliberate spread of
disease, but also **[much [broader]{.mark} scope of [biological
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[related to the]{.mark} **increasing
[global circulation of bodies]{.mark}, materials, [and
technologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Braun, 2007; Cooper, 2006). The
narratives of how biological agents may be used in political violence
changed further in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the United
States and the anthrax letters incidents as a part of a broader concern
that malign nonstate actors may seek to develop and use WMD (Guillemin,
2005; Wright, 2006). [[The taxonomy of]{.mark} biological
[threats]{.mark} and risks [started to]{.mark}]{.underline} increasingly
[[include]{.underline}]{.mark} not only biological warfare, but also
**[[biological terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, biological crimes,
laboratory incidents, [[and dual-use research]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
some add even naturally occurring pandemics to this issue-area as well
(Koblentz, 2010). To address biological risks and threats, many
governments started to develop new strategies for managing these issues
(Bonin, 2007; Lentzos and Rose, 2009).

These changes have been compiled under the notion of biosecurity (Lakoff
and Collier, 2008; Rappert and Gould, 2009). [[Biosecurity embodies a
new approach to secure society]{.mark} against biological threats and
risks, **[legitimizing]{.mark} a state of [continuous
bio-emergency]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Braun, 2007). As such,
[[biosecurity leads to]{.underline}]{.mark} not only new understanding
of values and vulnerabilities in security politics but also [new
[techniques of **anticipatory** governance]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf.
Anderson, 2010), [which justify]{.underline} the establishment of [new
preparedness policies and practices crossing the boundaries of
disarmament, policing, public health, science governance,
etc]{.underline}. (Caduff, 2012; Cooper, 2006; Dobson et al., 2013).

The attempts to develop new governmental techniques to address
bio-insecurities can also be observed in the biological weapons regime,
with an effect on science--security relations. Similarly to the chemical
weapons regime, biological disarmament is thought of as facing the
challenge of "global shifts in the nature and mode of organized violence
and conflicts, and incremental and interlinked changes in science and
technology" (Ilchmann and Revill, 2014: 754). These challenges have been
recognized at the BWC especially after 2002, when new ways to approach
biological disarmament started to be sought.5 Scholars point out several
dimensions of this development in this regard.

On-the-one-hand, [[linking bioweapons with
terrorism]{.underline}]{.mark} and other nontraditional forms of
political violence [[caused changing understandings of the referent
object]{.mark} threatened by bioweapons]{.underline}. Not militaries,
but [**[whole populations]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[perceived as [the risk group]{.mark} to be protected]{.underline}. As a
result, [the preparedness for biological risks started to be linked more
with the **governance of public health**]{.underline}---both in national
and international contexts (Kelle, 2007).6 On-the-other-hand, what came
to be seen as a key concern for the BWC has been the pace of
techno-scientific progress in life sciences and the convergence of life
sciences with chemistry, engineering, and other academic fields. Because
biowarfare programs of the 20th century were established in close
conjunction with broader scientific developments, the capacity of
disarmament practices to keep up with the rapid advances in life
sciences is seen as crucial for the success of the regime (Dando, 1999).
Scholars and practitioners alike in this regard point out especially the
increasing scope of facilities, equipment, agents, and knowledge that
have socalled dual-use and may be thus used in legitimate research and
development and for causing harm (Atlas and Dando, 2006; Buchanan and
Kelley, 2013; Revill and Jefferson, 2013; Tucker, 2012). Given the
apparent accessibility of biological materials and technologies, the
rising power of science and technology is seen as increasing the
opportunities of state and nonstate actors to obtain bioweapons and
enhance their lethality (Atlas and Dando, 2006; Chyba and Greninger,
2004; McLeish and Nightingale, 2007; Tucker and Zilinskas, 2006).

### L -- China

#### The China threat is [not objective]{.underline}, but a product of [technical expert discourse]{.underline} that [presumes]{.underline} securitized outcomes and then dogmatically selects evidence to "confirm" pre-supposed "reality"\-\--this [locks]{.underline} US/China relations into a spiral of conflict

**Song 15 --** Weiqing Song, PhD, Associate Professor of Political
Science @ Macau, Securitization of the "China Threat" Discourse: A
Poststructuralist Account The China Review, Vol. 15, No. 1, Spring,
145-169

[Within the China threat]{.underline} genre [there is a]{.underline}
broader range of [discursive example]{.underline}s [following the
scientific mode]{.underline} of securitization. These are mostly
scholarly works enacted by academics. Here is a classic \"theory as
practice\" text: Can China rise peacefully? My answer is no. If China
continues its impres sive economic growth over the next few decades, the
United States and China are likely to engage in an intense security
competition with conside rable potential for war. Most of China\'s
neighbours---including India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Russia and
Vietnam---will join with the United States to contain China\'s power.40
At the very beginning of this essay, boldly titled \"China\'s Unpeace
ful Rise,\" John [Mearsheimer]{.underline}, a world-renowned IR scholar,
[pessimistically predicts the consequences of China\'s
rise]{.underline}. [Mearsheimer\'s claim]{.underline} that China\'s rise
will be \"unpeaceful\" [is]{.underline} clearly in [antithesis to the
Chinese government\'s promise]{.underline} of a \"peaceful rise.\" In a
typical example of the latter, Zheng, a former Chinese official and
policy advisor, assures the outside world that \"China does not seek
hegemony or predominance in world affairs,\" and that \"China\'s
development depends on world peace--- a peace that its development will
in turn reinforce.\"41 [People are thus faced with two opposing
scenarios for IR in East Asia. Which should one believe]{.underline}? A
poststructuralist reading of the above extract suggests that
[Mearsheimer articulates [the China threat]{.mark} theory through the
scientific mode of representation]{.underline}. First, [there is a
process of structural incorporation, whereby the subject of China
**[serves]{.mark} the [broader interests]{.mark}** [of academic
enquiry]{.mark}.]{.underline} In short, **[although this is a serious
issue of \"hard\" security, it is presented as a research
topic.]{.underline}** The author does not mention the China threat
directly in the essay, and his argument develops in a fairly objective
tone. Indeed, [Mearsheimer emphasizes at the outset the need for a
\"theory of international politics\" that explains the behavior of
rising great powers when one tries to \"**predict\" the future of world
politics**.]{.underline}42 Therefore, the issue of [[China\'s
rise]{.mark} and its consequences [is fashioned as an **academic
subject**]{.mark} **rather than an internationally current topic of
passionate debate**.]{.underline} In the scientific mode, [the China
threat is [securitized via \"scientific\"
reasoning]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this regard, [[the referent object
is]{.mark} the national [security of the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates, the world\'s single remaining
superpower and its allies. [The subject or audience comprises the
intellectual elites and]{.underline}, more important, **[policy
makers]{.underline}** of the United States and its allies. [The
securitizers are IR [academics]{.mark}]{.underline} and policy analysts,
represented in the above extract by Mearsheimer. From the
poststructuralist perspective, [these agents [**perform**
securitization]{.mark} acts by **formulating theories,
[predicting]{.mark} inevitable [outcomes, and advocating policy]{.mark}
options**.]{.underline} As a result, **[the distinction between theory
and practice disappears]{.underline}** at this point. [To ensure that
the issue of the China threat is situated in the **relevant epistemic
terrain**, the proper language must be **adopted** for]{.underline}
academic **[debate]{.underline}** on the existence and nature of the
threat posed by China. Mearsheimer thus claims that his argument is
based on a \"theory\" of rising great powers and the effects of their
rise on international politics. As students of international politics
will immediately recognize, [this \"theory\" is the \"offensive\"
variant of]{.underline} the [realist IR tradition]{.underline}, well
docu mented in Mearsheimer\'s 2001 book The Tragedy of Great Power
Politics,43 In this influential study, Mearsheimer presents his argument
on the China threat issue with consummate professionalism. He first
enumerates the five \"bedrock\" assumptions of offensive realism: an
anarchic international system; the inherently offensive military
capabili ties of great powers; uncertainty about other states\'
intentions; survival as the primary goal; and the rationality of state
actors. The combined effects of these assumptions are that great powers
tend to be fearful of each other, to rely upon themselves for their
survival, and to try by any means to maximize their own power.44
[Mearsheimer concludes that this \"scientific\" logic is]{.underline}
generally [applicable as an explanation]{.underline} of the behavior of
great powers that \"seek to gain as much power as possible over their
rivals.\"45 The issues of power and knowledge are crucial to the
scientific mode. **[[Only certain individuals can lay claim to]{.mark}
the [\"knowledge\"]{.mark} that is widely [accepted as
legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The dominant \"knowledge\" of global
affairs is both \"arbitrary]{.underline}\" (in the sense that it is only
one of many inter pretations) [and \"non-arbitrary\" (in the sense that
certain interpretative practices predominate worldwide)]{.underline}.46
For an interpretation of global affairs to become dominant, it requires
power and authority in its field. The epistemological and ontological
foundations of interpretations of IR thus matter less than their
authority. [Due to]{.underline} his well-established
[reputation]{.underline} worldwide as a scholar of IR, Mearsheimer\'s
[acts of securitization have considerable power and
authority]{.underline}. One survey ranks him among the scholars with the
greatest influence and most interesting output in the field over the
past few decades.47 According to Google Scholar, The Tragedy of Great
Power Politics has been cited as many as 3,371 times (as of April 2014).
With regard to substantial modality, the main social spheres add ressed
by the scientific mode of securitization are military and strategic.
[Unlike China, which defends itself]{.underline} [against]{.underline}
China [threat allegations]{.underline} primarily [with reassurances of
goodwill]{.underline}, **[[a securitizer]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like
Mearsheimer, **[[seeks to argue from a \"scientific\"
basis]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [He reasons that \"to predict the future
in Asia, one needs a theory of international politics\"that
is\"logically sound.\']{.underline}48 [Mearsheimer]{.underline} builds a
specific communicative \"sign system\" in the use of scientific language
to make claims to knowledge.49 He [speaks from the perspective of a
scientifically trained expert]{.underline} in world politics, thus
[[privileging **technical language**]{.underline}]{.mark} over everyday
language. [The threat]{.underline} posed by a rising China to
international security **[is reasoned\"scientifically\" to be
inevitable]{.underline}**. This raises the question of what practice or
activity this use of language is designed to elicit. [By persuading
readers]{.underline} of the inevi tability of [[a]{.mark} Chinese
[threat]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [Mearsheimer [may]{.mark} aim
to **[prompt]{.mark} the [action]{.mark} perceived as necessary [to
prevent]{.mark} this threat**]{.underline}. According to a survey titled
\"The Ivory Tower,\" published in Foreign Policy, the majority of both
academics and practitioners in the United States consider China\'s rise
to be the most important U.S. foreign-policy challenge.50 Similarly,
both [IR scholars and practitioners regularly pinpoint East Asia as the
region of greatest strategic impor tance to the United States today and
over the next 20 years.]{.underline} Although most [IR
scholars]{.underline} agree that China\'s political influence has not
yet exceeded that of the United States, they [predict that the chance of
war between the two countries will increase]{.underline} from 13 percent
in the next 10 years to 23 percent in the next 30 years.51 [**In the
scientific mode, [securitizers reason deductively from]{.mark}
scientific [theory to the existence of a]{.mark} \"China
[threat]{.mark}.\"** This deductive process entails many instances of
\"intertextuality]{.underline},\"[52 moments at which one spoken or
written text alludes to, quotes, or otherwise relates to
another.]{.underline} [Discussion of the China threat is no longer
limited to the world of academia]{.underline}; for instance, [the issue
has been widely referenced and examined by U.S. journalists in books
that have subsequently become bestsellers]{.underline}.53 It is
difficult to trace the ways in which academics and policy makers
influence each other. However, it is clear that renowned IR scholars
like Mearsheimer are influential not only in their own fields but far
beyond. Here, [**[knowledge and power mutually reinforce]{.mark} each
other.** [With]{.mark} the [increasing popularity of **offensive
realism**]{.mark} and power transition theory, people in many different
professions are alluding to or talking at length about the so-called
China threat.]{.underline} **[In scholarly discuss ion, policy analysis,
and strategic planning, [the issue is]{.mark} often [taken as a
given]{.mark}]{.underline}**. (152-5)

In recent years, [there has been renewed interest among]{.underline}
International Relations (**[IR]{.underline}**) [**scholars** in the
ability of the **Western security community** to **protect itself** from
a variety of **threats** and challenges]{.underline}. In this context,
longstanding [**debates** concerning the role played by]{.underline} the
organization that is widely regarded as the institutional expression of
that community---**[NATO]{.underline}**---[have recently taken on new
dimensions]{.underline}. [Scholars and policymakers often disagree in
their interpretations of the relative strength of NATO, but many agree
that the alliance needs to play a central role in protecting the West
from a mix of conventional and non-conventional dangers, ranging from an
increasingly assertive Russia to transnational terrorism]{.underline}.
[[One of the key **assumptions underpinning**]{.mark} many [analyses is
that **NATO** constitutes]{.mark} the institutional expression of [a
**pre-existing Western security community** united around
**liberal-democratic**]{.mark} **norms and
[values]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**However**, a close reading of the
alliance's **history** shows that, far from simply representing a
pre-given community, **NATO** has always been involved in **constructing
"the West."** At the heart of that process of social construction lie
practices of collective (re)imagining of the Western world in specific
ways, as well as the **[representation]{.mark}---and management
[of---internal tensions as feuds within a community united by shared
liberal values]{.mark}**. Today, the task of **managing internal
differences** has been rendered **particularly difficult** by the rise
of **radical conservative political forces** in several allied
states]{.underline}.

[This [has **translated into a clash between liberal and illiberal
interpretations of the Western security community**, which]{.mark} has
the potential to **[seriously complicate inter-allied
relations]{.mark}** in the foreseeable future]{.underline}. As this
paper shows, [contrary to conventional wisdom, middle powers have always
played important roles in the constitution of the Western security
community. More recently, they have also played significant roles in
contesting liberal interpretations of the security community, and
articulating an alternative, **radical conservative vision of the
West**. Recent developments in allied countries such as Turkey and
Poland are a potent reminder that not all middle powers are alike; on
the contrary, based on their socially constructed, historically specific
definitions of identity, they can perform a diversity of international
roles---in support of, or, conversely, as **obstacles to liberal
internationalism**]{.underline}.

The narrative of Western unity and the politics of collective forgetting
during the Cold War

One of the most influential narratives of international security put
forward by liberal IR scholars and practitioners centres on the
Euro-Atlantic security community, consisting of a group of countries
united around a set of key liberal norms and institutions that generate
''dependable expectations'' of peaceful resolution of conflicts that
might arise among them.1 From that perspective, NATO is an institution
that was created in the context of the Cold War to protect the
pre-existing security community from the threats posed by the West's
dangerous other: the communist bloc. Yet, [as a series of constructivist
scholars have persuasively argued, there is nothing natural about the
Western security community]{.underline}.2 In Emanuel Adler's words,
''security communities are socially constructed and rest on shared
practical knowledge of the peaceful resolution of conflicts.''3
[Furthermore, the **absence of violence** should **not** lead us to
conclude that the **construction of** security communities in general
and the **Western community** in particular were **power-free
processes**]{.underline}. [On the contrary]{.underline}, as Adler and
Barnett explain, [central to the establishment of a security community
is the dialectic between power---primarily **symbolic power**---and
**knowledge**]{.underline}.4 Thus, in the physically non-violent context
of security communities, power is primarily ''the authority to determine
the shared meanings that embody the identities, interests and practices
of states, as well as the conditions that confer, defer or deny access
to goods and benefits.''5 Applying this logic to the specific case of
[**NATO**, we can see]{.underline} the alliance [**not** as the
**institutional expression of a pre-given community**, but, rather, as
an organization that has been **deeply involved in power-filled
practices of construction and reproduction** of that
community]{.underline}.6

Historical evidence indicates that the founders of NATO---policymaking
elites from the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, France, and
the Benelux states---did not take the Western security community for
granted. Instead, they engaged in a systematic set of practices aimed at
constructing a sense of community around a shared set of
liberal-democratic norms in the Euro-Atlantic area, and placed the newly
created North Atlantic Treaty Organization at the heart of those
practices. In the intergovernmental debates leading up to the
establishment of NATO, the threat of military confrontation with the
Soviet Union was regarded as less worrisome than the danger of communist
subversion within the weakened societies of Western European states.7 In
that context, as Louis St. Laurent---then Canadian Secretary of State
for External Affairs---argued, the best way to prevent a third world war
was by confronting ''the forces of communist expansion with an
overwhelming preponderance of moral, economic and military force on the
side of freedom.''8

At the level of top Western political elites, the fear of communism
inspired a collective (re)definition of political identity in the
Euro-Atlantic area. The ''spectre of Communism'' provided the defining
other against which decision-makers on both sides of the Atlantic were
able to subordinate their differences to a collective definition of a
Western community. That community was seen as based on the common
heritage of political and cultural ideas of member states; its defining
mark was the set of shared values of individual liberal freedoms, the
rule of law, and democracy.9 This view is clearly reflected in the
preamble to the Washington Treaty (NATO's foundational treaty), which
stipulates that the alliance is based on principles of democracy,
individual liberty, and law.

Contrary to what conventional (realist) wisdom suggests, NATO was not
simply set up as the hegemonic instrument of the US. On the contrary,
political actors from other states---most notably Canada---played key
roles in driving the process of establishing NATO and defining its key
foundational principles.10 In fact, one of the key articles in the
Washington Treaty is informally known as the ''Canadian'' article,
precisely in recognition of the influential role played by Canadian
policymakers in its formulation.11 Article 2 clearly shows that NATO was
expected to play a role that went far beyond that of a conventional
military alliance. That article succinctly summarizes the precepts of
the Kantian-inspired democratic peace theory, as it stipulates: ''The
Parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and
friendly international relations by strengthening their free
institutions, by bringing about a better understanding of the principles
upon which these institutions are founded, and by promoting conditions
of stability and well-being.''

To decision-makers locked in a competition with forces regarded as
representing communist otherness, it was imperative that countries of
Western Europe, Canada, and the US cultivate a sense of shared
liberal-democratic identity---set in opposition to communism---among
their peoples. In that context, they sought to articulate a narrative of
Western unity, and disseminate it as widely as possible in the countries
of the Atlantic Alliance. As Erik Ringmar has argued, identities are
constructed, maintained, and transformed via the telling of
''constitutive'' narratives.12 Narratives provide a set of meanings
within which an actor's identity, the situation within which they are
located and the actions deemed appropriate are brought together.13 The
process of telling constitutive narratives is especially important
during periods of fundamental transformation, when new identities are
being formed and old ones are being pressured to evolve.14

In the eyes of Western leaders, [the **narrative of unity among NATO
members** had to not only cultivate a sense of shared identity, but also
to **delegitimize**---by casting them **as inconsistent with Western
identity**---communist forces that were becoming increasingly powerful
in many allied states]{.underline}. Once again, some of the most
influential voices in favour of disseminating a narrative of Western
unity and using that to legitimize community-building practices within
NATO were its middle powers---particularly Canada. For instance, the
Canadian Foreign Minister, Lester Pearson, repeatedly argued in the
early 1950s that NATO's long-term goal had to be the creation of a
community of free nations in the Atlantic area. More broadly, Canadian
officials, together with NATO supporters from Norway, the Netherlands,
Denmark, and the UK, were acutely aware of the fact that, in order for
the alliance to be able to help build ''a community of free nations''
united around liberal values, it had to find a way to help publics from
allied states transcend recent memories of war among Western states.
What was required, in other words, was a collective
reinterpretation---and a selective forgetting---of the recent past.15
After all, the newly identified enemy, communist Soviet Union, had
emerged from the war as a hero in the eyes of many in the West.

[The view of the **''West as one''** became central to a **collective
(re)reading of Western history** following the establishment of the
alliance]{.underline}.16 [Collective efforts at history (re)writing
found expression not only within the public discourse articulated by
NATO, but also in confidential documents]{.underline}. [Recently
**declassified documents**]{.underline} from the 1950s [reveal a set of
shared understandings among NATO's decision-makers regarding the way in
which the **history of member states should be interpreted in order to
foster a sense of Western community**]{.underline}. [In addition, **NATO
mobilized its substantial material and symbolic power** to widely
**disseminate the discourse on Western unity** in all the allied states
and, simultaneously, to **delegitimize alternative readings of
history---especially** those that focused on ideas of
**solidarity**---**and memories of friendship**---**with the Soviet
Union**]{.underline}.17 In particular, as Patrick Jackson has
demonstrated, the discourse of Western civilization played a key role in
orchestrating the collective (re)reading of Germany as a member of the
Western community, and on this basis legitimating its incorporation into
NATO.

[This is **not** to suggest that the West was **an essential entity**
that **objectively determined a field of outcomes**. Rather, **''Western
civilization''** needs to be understood as ''rhetorical commonplace,''
**used by allied policymakers as a discursive resource** for
**de-legitimating policy options** opposed to]{.underline} Germany's
incorporation into [American-led institutions]{.underline}.18 In the
official NATO discourse, Germany was interpreted as a member of the
Western family that, under the Nazi regime, had temporarily deviated
from its core values. Following the end of that regime, however, (West)
Germany---acting under the close supervision of allied states---could
and should be reintegrated into the Euro-Atlantic community.

Against the background of the constitutive discourse on Western unity,
disagreements and tensions that continued to occur among member states
could be represented as ''family'' feuds, and managed within the
framework of shared norms and a persisting sense of community. A full
analysis of inter-allied disagreements during the Cold War is beyond the
scope of this paper. However, it is worthwhile to briefly examine what
could be seen as one of the most significant set of disagreements within
NATO: arguments concerning the accession to the alliance of states that
did not comply with the liberal-democratic norms and values around which
the Western community defined itself. Particularly interesting were
arguments over the inclusion of Portugal in 1949, as well as the
accession of Greece and especially Turkey (completed in 1952). In that
context, middle powers like Canada and Norway emerged as strong
proponents of the view that countries which did not respect basic
liberal-democratic values did not belong---and should not be
included---in the alliance which represented the Western community.19 In
the end, however, all the allies were persuaded to support the inclusion
of those ''problem'' countries. Several factors were crucial to the
emergence of that consensus: a shared recognition among the allies of
the geostrategic importance of those countries in the context of growing
confrontation with the Soviet Union, and a sense that, in that
particular context, the inclusion of strategically vital but normatively
deviant states was an acceptable compromise in the name of protecting
the community of liberal values. The prevailing view came to be that the
integration of states like Portugal and Turkey could be managed in a way
that would not necessarily endanger the core values of the West.
Furthermore, inclusion into the Western community was seen by some
allied policymakers as a course of action that could help those
countries evolve into stable liberal democracies. It is revealing, in
fact, that a normative compromise that was eventually seen as reasonable
in the cases of Portugal and Turkey was regarded as inappropriate in the
case of a country whose political regime was perceived as an active
threat to liberal-democratic values: Franco's Spain.20 As Mark Smith put
it, ''Turkey could be accommodated, and Portugal's dictatorship had less
Fascistic origins than Spain's. Significantly, neither had a history of
active antagonism toward Western European liberalism. Admitting Franco
would be admitting a regime of the very sort that had overturned
European democracy in the 1930s and 1940s, and as such was wholly
unacceptable.''21

The ''triumph'' of the West and the spread of the liberal security
community in the early post-Cold War period

The end of the Cold War was accompanied by a sense of triumph by the
West over its defining other, and, as a corollary to this, a shared view
among allied decision-makers that a new security environment was
emerging in Europe. In a context marked by the breakdown of the Soviet
bloc and the eruption of violence linked to ethnic conflict and the
breakdown of states (most notably in the former Yugoslavia), there was a
shift away from definitions of security focused on military power, and
toward a heavy emphasis on ''good governance'' within states. In
essence, [**security** came to be **associated with** the
**liberal-democratic norms** and institutions; negatively, **risks**
came to be **seen as emerging from the absence** of liberal-democratic
structures]{.underline}.22 In a situation in which there was no clearly
identified enemy state, but in which developments within the transient
former communist countries threatened to undermine international
security, a consensus emerged that the promotion of ''good''
liberal-democratic norms and institutions within those states would be
vital for European and international security in the new era. In that
context, the project of disseminating liberal-democratic norms into the
former Eastern bloc also became central to NATO efforts to redefine its
mission---and thus demonstrate its continued relevance in the new era.23
In essence, NATO became deeply involved in reconstituting Central and
Eastern European polities through systematic practices of socializing
military and political elites as well as next generations of leaders
into liberal-democratic norms and institutions.24

In other words, the alliance engaged in performing its
liberal-democratic narrative via practices of disseminating
liberal-democratic dispositions and institutions of ''self-restraint''
into the former communist bloc.25 The idea was to provide the
Central/East European political and military elites with Western,
liberal-democratic scripts for rebuilding their societies, and to turn
those elites into ''responsible,'' self-disciplined actors, who would
take Western-prescribed liberal-democratic norms for granted.26 Special
emphasis was placed on socialising Central/Eastern Europeans into
Western-defined norms in the area of security, including norms governing
the relationships among different branches of the state involved in the
formulation and implementation of defence policies, and the relationship
between the state and civil society.27

NATO's ability to provide authoritative definitions of the legitimate
meaning of liberal-democratic identity, and more specifically, guidance
on how to correctly enact norms of security provision that corresponded
to that definition, was a reflection of the substantial symbolic power
exercised by NATO vis-a-vis the pro-West elites of Central and Eastern
Europe.28 That power was grounded in the latter's recognition of NATO
not just as a military alliance but as a key institution of the Western
community with which Central/Eastern European reformers identified.29 In
the early post-Cold War years, inter-allied disagreements continued to
occur---but did so within the framework of common norms, and were
generally cast as arguments within a community of liberal values. For
instance, while member states often disagreed over the speed and
desirable extent of NATO enlargement, they articulated those
disagreements against the background of the common view that NATO
enlargement was a key tool for the expansion of the liberal-democratic
values around which the Western community defined itself.30 More
dramatically, the allies disagreed sharply over the Iraq war. But even
in the context of that crisis, they were able to draw on NATO norms of
consultation to enable the alliance to survive.31

In light of all the above-mentioned developments, [one might be tempted
to conclude that the story of NATO's post-Cold War evolution has been a
very successful one. After all, in addition to enlarging and conducting
''out-of-area'' operations, **[NATO]{.mark}** has **expanded its
international socialization** programs **via new partnership
programs**]{.underline} that stretch as far as the Middle East and
former Soviet republics, [and has taken **[steps to adapt]{.mark}** its
institutional structure to twenty-first century challenges (e.g. [by
**developing new capabilities** for **addressing
non-conventional**]{.mark} risks and **[threats]{.mark}**)]{.underline}.
[In addition, [in the context of an **increasingly assertive
Russia**]{.mark}, members [have]{.mark} once again [articulated a
discourse of **allied unity**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and have deployed
multinational troop contingents to countries that feel vulnerable to
Russia.

It is also interesting to note that the alliance's middle powers
continued to play key roles in the early years of the post-Cold War
period. Just as they had done during the Cold War, countries like Canada
and Norway have supported initiatives aimed at protecting and expanding
NATO's ability to act as the institutional expression of the Western
community. For instance, these countries have been active participants
in practices of socialization aimed at disseminating norms of
liberal-democratic restraint, and have also been systematically involved
in military exercises and recent multinational deployments. Canada, in
particular, was central to NATO's involvement in Afghanistan. Indeed,
one could argue that ''Canada has demonstrated a dedication to the
alliance that seems stronger than NATO's collective commitment to
itself.''32 More recently, Canada assumed a leading role within the
framework of NATO's enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) Battlegroup Latvia.

[**[Yet]{.mark}**, a [closer analysis reveals]{.mark} that the question
of **allied [unity]{.mark}** in the post-Cold War era is becoming
increasingly complicated. In particular, the alliance is currently
facing **serious [challenges]{.mark}** that [are **connected not so much
to external threats**]{.mark} or enemies [as]{.mark} to
**[internal]{.mark} developments**---specifically [the rise of **radical
conservative**]{.mark} **ideas and political [forces]{.mark}** in
several member states, including in key middle powers. This has
[**translated into** an **unprecedented disagreement over the meaning of
the Western community**]{.mark}---a disagreement [that]{.mark} threatens
to **[pose serious challenges to]{.mark} inter-allied
[unity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

(Re)imagining the West: The radical conservative reply

One of the most significant challenges to the unity of NATO and its
ability to continue to define itself as the institutional expression of
a liberal-democratic community stems from recent developments in a
powerful middle power: Turkey. As noted above, Turkey has always had a
complicated history in NATO. But, since its inclusion in the alliance,
the country of Atatu¨rk has never had a government that is as explicitly
critical of Western values, and that has violated as many of NATO's
norms, as the current administration under President Erdog˘an. Despite
being democratically elected, Turkey's ruling AKP party has moved toward
increasingly authoritarian measures. During the coup attempt in July
2016, the AKP government declared a state of emergency, purged the
public sector of (allegedly) proGu¨lenist individuals, and criminalized
opposition groups including Kurds, Alevites, leftists, and liberals.
Furthermore, recent constitutional reforms have transformed the country
from a parliamentary democracy into a ''Turkish style'' presidential
republic.33 Erdog˘an, who emphasizes traditional Islamic morality and
presents himself as a ''conservative democrat,'' has presided over a
systematic crackdown on civil liberties and attacks on secular
institutions.

To make matters worse, Turkey has recently adopted a series of worrisome
foreign policies, which seem to signal a move away from Western
partnerships. Since the failed coup, the government has engaged in a
purge of military officers seen as pro-West, has explored military
cooperation with China, and has expressed outrage over the US-led
coalition's support for Kurdish forces in Syria and Iraq. In addition,
despite months of warnings from NATO allies both publicly and privately,
President Erdog˘an has decided to upgrade his country's air defence with
a US\$2.5 billion (E2.03 billion) investment in a Russian surface-to-air
missile system, the S-400 ''Triumf.'' From NATO's perspective, the
procurement of this missile system is deeply problematic as it means
that Turkey will rely on new heavy weaponry that cannot be integrated
within allied structures.34 In the longer term, Turkey's new policy of
rapprochement vis-a-vis Moscow raises difficult questions about the
extent to which the allies can rely on Ankara to help maintain a united
front on an increasingly aggressive Russia. Last but not least,
[Ankara's very visible **shift toward authoritarianism makes it
increasingly difficult for NATO** representatives **to sustain the
narrative** that depicts the alliance as the institutional expression of
a **security community defined around liberal-democratic norms**. This
is **particularly problematic** in a situation in which, as noted above,
the alliance has **relied heavily on that narrative to secure post-Cold
War legitimacy** in the eyes of its publics, and **also to exercise**
subtle but effective forms of **power in its
neighbourhood**]{.underline}.

In response to Turkey's deviation from democratic norms and military
partnership with Russia, NATO has adopted a two-pronged strategy:
expressing continued solidarity with Turkey in its fight against
terrorism, while at the same time warning Ankara about potentially
serious consequences if it does not change its domestic behaviour as
well as refrain from further military cooperation with Russia.35

Yet, [**NATO's ability to maintain a united front** vis-a-vis
Turkey---and apply sustained pressure in an effort to change Ankara's
behaviour---is likely to be **seriously complicated** by]{.underline}
broader political developments in the Euro-Atlantic area. In particular,
the alliance is witnessing [the rise of **radical conservative political
forces** in several other member states, and some of those states have
expressed support for Turkey's illiberal policies and
practices]{.underline}. Increasingly, what seems to be taking shape is
[an informal ''club'' of countries dominated by **[far-right
parties]{.mark}** that [are articulating]{.mark} an **alternative,
radical conservative vision of Western identity**, and, on this basis,
**[a different script for how to perform the role of members of the
Western community]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A full analysis of these developments is beyond the scope of this paper,
but a few brief examples can help to illustrate the growing challenge
posed by radical conservative political forces in the Euro-Atlantic
area. Consider, for instance, the evolution of another key NATO middle
power, Poland. Similar to another NATO state, Hungary, Poland was until
recently regarded as one of the chief success stories from the wave of
democratization that accompanied the end of the Cold War. Yet, in the
eyes of the leaders of the archconservative Law and Justice (PiS) party,
Poland was a deeply troubled society whose system of government was in
need of a top-to-bottom overhaul.36 Ahead of the 2015 elections, PiS
appropriated a radical conservative vocabulary similar to that of
Hungary's Fidesz in its 2010 campaign. It depicted the centre-right
government as the architect of a failed economy, and denounced
mainstream leaders as more comfortable with the cosmopolitan liberal
values of Brussels and Berlin than with the traditional Christian
morality of rural Poland.

To put this in a broader perspective, [the Polish and Hungarian
political programs can be seen as **part of an international wave of
far-right protests against liberal-democratic values** and institutions.
Above all, in the eyes of the Hungarian and Polish leaders---similar to
the far-right parties in other NATO member states---the focus needs to
be on identity politics. Their **vision of the world [revolves
around]{.mark} the idea of a [division]{.mark} into competing groups,
largely defined [around racist and religious lines]{.mark}**; in this
zero-sum-game vision, the success of their group (white Christians) is
their primary concern]{.underline}. Starting from this perspective, the
governments of Poland and Hungary have identified Erdog˘an's Turkey as a
key ally in their struggle to ''defend'' their countries from what they
regard as a key threat to their national identity and their European
Christian heritage: refugees coming from Muslim countries.

[In the eyes of Warsaw and Budapest, in particular, Erdog˘an's
willingness---and ability---to keep Muslim refugees away from Europe is
much more important than any violations of human rights and democratic
principles that his government might be responsible for]{.underline}.
Revealingly, Poland was the first EU member state to host the Turkish
leader after the unsuccessful coup attempt in Turkey, and wasted no time
in expressing its unconditional support for Ankara.37 In a similar vein,
speaking at a recent Turkish-Hungarian Business Forum in Ankara, Prime
Minister Viktor Orba´n insisted that Hungary ''stands by its friends,''
and is ''on Turkey's side.''38 In his speech, the prime minister
emphasized that Hungary's loyal support for Turkey is not a one-off
event, but ''a consequence of Hungary's strategy, as a conservative
country, of prioritising human values.'' The reason is very clear:
''Turkey is on the edge of Europe, protecting Europe's interior,'' and
''if it had not fulfilled its obligations, Europe would have been
flooded with many millions of immigrants---which it would not have known
what to do with.''39

According to the Hungarian leader, [the support provided by Budapest and
Warsaw to Ankara is neither an accident nor an isolated event. Rather,
it reflects a **shared commitment to the promotion of conservative
principles** as a **radical constitutive narrative** that is
**significantly different from the liberal narrative of the
West**]{.underline}. Thus, [instead of emphasizing the
**liberal-democratic** foundations of the **Western security
community**, the focus---in the eyes of the Polish and Hungarian radical
conservative governments---should be on the **''true roots'' of the
West: its Christian traditions and values**]{.underline}. It is the
Christian heritage that, in this narrative, constitutes the most
important element of Western identity. References to the Christian roots
of the Western community embodied in NATO are, of course, not new. Even
during the Cold War there were political parties and groups that
stressed Christianity in their discourse on the West. But in that
context, the Christian roots and values were generally seen as
compatible with liberal democracy.40 By contrast, [the radical
conservative vision of the West **[depicts]{.mark} contemporary [liberal
institutions]{.mark}** and practices **[as a threat to the Christian
foundations of the Western community]{.mark}**. In this view, it is the
Christian heritage that needs to be prioritized in all debates and
initiatives concerning Euro-Atlantic security---and that needs to be
central to how states perform the role of members of the Western
community. This, in the eyes of the Polish and Hungarian leaders, is
particularly important in a situation in which **the West is under
serious threat**, not only from the **Muslim refugees** that have
arrived in Europe because of ''irresponsible'' measures adopted by
countries like Germany and that are ''unable to adopt Catholic
culture,'' but also from **domestic liberal elites**]{.underline}.
Ironically, the ''weakness'' of liberal elites has led to a situation in
which Europe needs to rely on Muslim Turkey to keep non-Christian
refugees away from its shores. In a series of virulent outbursts,
conservative leaders in Poland and Hungary have criticized liberal
politicians for their ''attacks'' on national traditions, family values,
and the religious foundations of society via their ''corrupt'' policies
in favour of multiculturalism, homosexuality, and capitalist greed.41

It is interesting to note that the radical conservative model
articulated in Warsaw and Budapest---and the strategies adopted to
promote that model---are similar to the branch of conservatism pursued
in the US under President Trump.42 What is involved here goes far beyond
traditional conservative critiques of big, inefficient government and
expensive welfare policies. From this particular conservative
perspective, liberalism---which has had a corrupting effect on
society---is supported not only by the key organs of representative
government and the judiciary, but also by intellectuals and large
numbers of bureaucrats. The excessively permissive multicultural values
and the politically correct principles promoted by cultural and
professional elites, and the institutions controlled by those elites,
constitute the foundation of liberal power and allegedly undermine
''authentic'' (conservative) principles and national culture on a daily
basis. [On this logic, liberalism can only be effectively challenged,
and eventually dismantled, via systematic attack on all those elites and
institutions]{.underline}.

[This view has **[translated into]{.mark}** a number of
**[policies]{.mark}** and practices [that have taken **Poland** as well
as **Hungary** away from]{.mark} the path of **[liberal-democratic
reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Contrary to the liberal belief in
self-discipline and institutions that ensure a system of checks and
balances and limit the power of the executive, from the perspective of
conservative leaders in Warsaw and Budapest the focus needs to be on
establishing and protecting a strong executive, capable of protecting
not just the physical space of the state, but also its national identity
and culture. Thus, since coming to power with a parliamentary majority
in October 2015, Poland's PiS has embarked on a course of change that
mirrors the changes enacted by Fidesz in Hungary. As in Hungary, in
Poland an initial focus for the new government was securing control of
the Constitutional Tribunal. PiS has moved to pack the court with its
own appointees, using tactics that are blatantly illegal according to
Polish law, and which have drawn severe criticism from the EU. However,
party leader Jaroslaw Kaczyn´ski, who holds a seat in the parliament but
no formal government position, has much greater ambitions to refashion
Poland along culturally conservative and politically illiberal lines.
The media are a major target in this fight against ''liberal
corruption.'' The government quickly asserted control over public
broadcasters and purged them of (independent) journalists whom it
regarded as loyal to the opposition.

The discourse---and practices---of allied solidarity around liberal
norms and values have been further undermined by developments in the US
following the election of Donald Trump. Given the similarities between
the far-right ideas promoted by the Polish and Hungarian governments and
some of the views articulated by President Trump, it is not surprising
to see the friendship that seems to have emerged between these
countries---particularly between Washington and Warsaw. For our purposes
here, [what is important to note is that this friendship has
**[translated into special partnerships in]{.mark} the field of
[security]{.mark}**[, in ways that]{.mark} could **[further undermine
unity within NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [To give a brief
example]{.underline}: echoing Trump's discourse, [[the **Polish
government**]{.mark} has **[repeatedly and explicitly called for
increased spending]{.mark} on defence [by]{.mark} the European
[allies]{.mark}**, has adopted a massive defence budget (including
purchases of expensive **[military equipment from the US]{.mark}**), has
invited large numbers of US and NATO troops on its territory, has signed
bilateral **[military cooperation agreements]{.mark}** with
Washington]{.underline}, and has followed the US president in raising
questions about the degree to which allies that refuse to increase their
defence spending can rely on the alliance's collective defence clause.
Similar to Trump, [senior Polish officials have been **[very critical of
EU]{.mark} projects to promote closer European [integration]{.mark}**,
particularly in the field of defence]{.underline}. To them, it would be
unrealistic to assume that Europe can be self-sufficient in the realm of
defence, and dangerous to allow supranational European institutions to
control defence policies, which are central to a country's national
sovereignty. [[Instead]{.mark}, from the point of view of the Polish
government, the **[focus]{.mark} should be [on strengthening
NATO]{.mark}**---as the alliance of independent nation-states [that can
**keep the US involved**]{.mark} in European defence [and]{.mark} can
**[protect the (Christian) Western community from]{.mark} a wide range
of [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Here, again, radical conservative statements about NATO involve **not**
just an attempt to promote **specific policies** in the field of
defence, but also---**far more broadly**---a move to **(re)articulate
the constitutive narrative** about [the **Western community embodied in
the**]{.mark} **Atlantic [Alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Specifically, that community [is now **cast**]{.mark} not in
liberal-democratic terms, but rather [as a **civilizational entity** in
which **Christianity plays a central role**]{.mark}---and which is **[in
danger due to liberal excesses]{.mark} and corruption**]{.underline}.
For instance, at a 2017 Warsaw Summit that brought together Central/East
European countries and the US, the Polish leadership and President Trump
were united in casting the West in radical conservative terms---as the
civilization that places emphasis on God, tradition, and family
values---and in [presenting their countries as states that understand
the true meaning of Western identity and are prepared to use their
institutions (including NATO) to protect the West from all those ''who
hate us\... and seek to undermine our strength]{.underline}.''43 The
alliance is especially important in a situation in which, Trump
insisted, ''\[t\]he fundamental question of our time is whether the West
has the will to survive.''44

When the Cold War ended, many analysts and policymakers expected NATO to
become obsolete and possibly to be dismantled following the
disappearance of threats to the community of states that the alliance
had been set up to protect. Now, almost three decades later, the
question is not whether NATO can survive in a situation marked by the
absence of threats, but whether it has the ability and resources to
adapt to the multitude of risks and challenges that it faces.
Interestingly, today---just as in its early days---some of [the **most
serious threats to NATO's ability to survive** stem **not** from
**external military threats** but from its own **internal weaknesses and
tensions**]{.underline}. In this instance, however, [[the danger
is]{.mark} not one of subversion by communist forces, but rather a clash
between liberal forces and (a particular version of) radical
conservative ideas and projects, which have risen to prominence in
several allied states]{.underline}. In this context, while certain
middle powers---like Canada and Norway---remain some of the most
significant defenders of liberal internationalism, other middle powers,
most notably Turkey and Poland, have emerged as key advocates of the
illiberal, radical conservative worldview. That clash is becoming
increasingly acute---with some observers and policymakers, including
France's President Macron, arguing that [[the **coming years** will be
marked by]{.mark} what amounts to [a **''civil war''**]{.mark} **between
liberal and illiberal forces [in the West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
outcome of that potential ''civil war'' is impossible to predict, but
one can safely predict that its dynamics are going to be among the most
important developments shaping the Euro-Atlantic world in the coming
years.

5.1. "Perpetuall feare"

[[**Cyber security** is]{.mark} often [characterised as
**fearful**]{.mark}, with cyber **threats** being both **permanent** and
**evolving**]{.underline} (Ehrlicher, 2021), [[and **cyber
attacks**]{.mark} being **[seen as inevitable]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Pearlson et al., 2021). The businesses in our study seemed to agree,
with cyber threat appearing to be normalised. Participants, both CISO
and non-CISO, considered these threats to be enduring and businesses
needed to accept that they would be compromised. This implies a
"perpetuall cyber warre" (Stevens, 2016, p. 120). These businesses
existed in "continuall feare" (Hobbes, 1985, p. 186), threatened by
"death, poverty, or other calamity" (Hobbes, 1985, p. 169) arising from
something, i.e, cyber security, that was not well understood, even
mystical,18 as "perpetuall feare, \[is\] always accompanying mankind in
the ignorance of causes" (Hobbes, 1985, p. 169-70).19 [The role of the
CISO]{.underline} may be valued as one "that can make the Holy Water"
(Hobbes, 1985, p. 692) that [**[provides protection]{.mark}** from
fearful things, [and, therefore, is **motivated to maintain the
fear**]{.mark} and dread [that underpins]{.mark} their
[value]{.mark}]{.underline}.20

Survival was clearly a concern for these businesses. Cyber security was
positioned as a threat to viability by many of these organisations, with
fear of regulatory action and associated fines and reputational damage
in particular being a prime concern. Such concerns with viability and
survival, arguably the primary motivation for businesses (Beer, 1979),
are analogous with seeking to avoid punishment that could lead to "pain,
and disability" and, ultimately, "death" (Gert, 2001, p. 243). The
punishments they sought to avoid were enacted by the larger Leviathan of
the state and, as mini-Leviathans, these businesses cascaded this
concept, instituting their own mechanisms of punishment for their
employees, as we discuss below. Internal experts were positioned by many
of these organisations as "guards" that protected them against the
various harms that they faced. Cyber security functions were seen as
assuagement against threats to business viability and helped these
businesses to manage the uncertainty they experienced as a result of
these threats and ensure their continued survival. This allowed them to
shape their future to a certain extent, aligning with Hobbes'
encouragements towards continued attentiveness to threats (Stevens,
2016), but also provided a resource that articulated and predicted those
threats, based on both past, and imagined future, events.

5.1.1. Permanent cyber emergency

Many of these [organisations played a role in national **[cyber
security]{.mark}**, including participating in invitation-only national
security working groups. Such [fora, in which **government
intel**]{.mark}**ligence [services share details of cyber
threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} with specific industries, [demonstrate
the role that governments play in maintaining a state of permanent cyber
emergency]{.underline}. [They [**provide a mechanism** through which
**governments** can both **maintain** fear and **amplify** it]{.mark}.
This could be achieved [through **exaggeration**]{.mark} or even
fabrication, particularly when considering the reliance of the state
Leviathan on the persistence of this fear]{.underline}.21

[[A **permanent emergency offers benefits** as a]{.mark} **"master
[narrative]{.mark}"**]{.underline} (Smith and Sparkes, 2008, p. 18)
[that can be invoked to support actions taken by businesses and
individuals within that business, whether to justify investment or [to
**justify restrictive controls** such as
**surveillance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we discuss in Section 5.3.
[The positioning of cyber security as warfare, which is a narrative
repeated by both media and governments]{.underline} (Stevens, 2016),
[establishes that concept in the minds of all parties to that war,
whether attacker or attacked]{.underline}. [**[Adversaries]{.mark}**, or
even just those who disagree, will [respond to the narrative of **cyber
security-as-war** and]{.mark} then [treat it as such, **focusing on
attack**]{.mark} and defence, rather than seeing it as anything else,
for example, as a collective problem of identifying and addressing
weaknesses that threaten all. This could lead to actions that [have
**unintended consequences**, such as state]{.mark} purchasing, and
[**hoarding**, of **vulnerabilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g. Hoeksma
(2017). [Cyber security-as-collective-problem could be considered a
"flattened narrative"]{.underline} (Farley, 2001), [with preference
instead provided to the cyber security-as-war concept which
[supports]{.mark} the **[maintenance of existing power
structures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This can also be considered as
[[indexing]{.mark} a "**meta-narrative**"]{.underline} (Symon et al.,
2014, p. 3) [of existing or **['traditional'
enemies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Stevens, 2016), [[and the "**superiority
of \...the West**"]{.underline}]{.mark} (Neocleous, 2008, p. 172), [as
suggested by the references to **(ex-)communist states**]{.underline}22
observed in the data. There is an almost paradoxical relevance of both
Foucault's and von Clausewitz's perspectives on war, with cyber war
being a "mere continuation of policy by other means" (von Clausewitz,
1873, p. 12) and cyber politics being "the continuation of war by other
means" (Foucault, 2004, p. 15).23 Each of these also provides economic
benefits (Neocleous, 2008), as we discuss below.

[[Positioning **cyber security** as an **existential threat**]{.mark},
as a war with "apocalyptic"]{.underline} (Stevens, 2016, p 121)
consequences, may also [[allow for **exceptionalism** and deviance
from]{.mark} existing **[laws]{.mark}**, both **[national and
supranational]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Hobbes explicitly permitted
defiance of law if motivated "by the terrour of present death" (Hobbes,
1985, p. 345). [Such exceptionalism based on existential threat can be
observed in]{.underline} modern societies, e.g. Government, Government;
[USA]{.underline} (2001), including [in relation to cyber security
threats]{.underline} (Walker, 2006). References to national security
also connect with this warfare motif. As the nation is 'under threat'
then there is a collective sense of conflict and, therefore, a
suggestion that everyone has to play their part.

[The fear generated by these threats propels citizens into "the waiting
arms of whoever might be ruling"]{.underline} (Chapman, 1975, p. 88).
Such fear may be [a "necessity-justification"]{.underline} (Chapman,
1975, p. 89) [for enduring power]{.underline}, and, as Chapman suggests,
it is straightforward to conceive of such "justification
\...\[occurring\] at the state level, as a function of real or
manufactured inter-state crises" (Chapman, 1975, p. 89), [particularly
with]{.underline} regard to [threats that are hard to
understand]{.underline} or somewhat ephemeral in nature, [such
as]{.underline} those related to [cyber security]{.underline}. If
cyber-security threats result in fearful and bewildered citizens, those
citizens are easier to moderate. Educating citizens on, or even
communicating the existence of, cyber threats may couple "paranoia with
pacification" (Chapman, 1975, p. 90).

In 'Digital Disaster, Cyber Security, and the Copenhagen School,'
published in 2009, Lene Hansen and Helen Nissenbaum suggest ways in
which [**[securitization theory]{.mark}** can [help us understand the
politics of **cybersecurity**]{.mark} and **cyberwar**, a complex
terrain [that brings together]{.mark} a variety of technical and policy
challenges that range from individual cybersecurity problems
(**cybercrime**) through to issues of national and **economic
cybersecurity** ([anxieties about **attacks on 'critical
infrastructure'**]{.mark})]{.underline} (Hansen and Nissenbaum, 2009).
Some of the threats point to [futuristic **['black swan'
disasters]{.mark}** that result [from]{.mark} our **high-speed
[networked society]{.mark}**]{.underline}; some of the challenges are
traditional problems -- abuse and harassment, grooming and recruitment,
identity theft and fraud -- carried out with new technologies. [The
cyberterrain is one where there is an anxiety that an individual can
become a national security problem in new and dangerous ways -- and
[where **cyber techniques**]{.mark} **and technologies [of]{.mark}
national [security]{.mark}** can [play out]{.mark} at the level of the
individual in new and unprecedented ways, with innovations [in]{.mark}
the **[surveillance]{.mark}** and monitoring [of **everyday
life**]{.mark}: the **security state** becomes]{.underline} - to use the
fashionable management term - **[increasingly granular]{.underline}**.
This essay returns to Hansen and Nissenbaum's article, an article that
introduced new complexities, questions and nuances to the study of
cybersecurity in security studies and international relations, to think
about the changing terrain of cybersecurity in the second decade of the
Twenty First Century-- and the importance (and problems) of thinking
about the 'non-West' in research on (cyber)securitization.

Hansen and Nissenbaum are interested in how the collective 'referent
objects' of 'the state,' 'society,' 'the nation' and 'the economy' are
presented as being threatened through three types of securitization that
'tie referent objects and securitizing actors together'(Ibid, p.1163):
hypersecuritization, everyday security practices and technifications. On
this view, [hypersecuritzation refers to the expansion of a security
problem into a realm where there is the danger that **threats** can be
**exaggerated**, resulting in **excessive
countermeasures**]{.underline}: these hypersecuritizations, according to
Hansen and Nissenbaum, always 'mobilize the spectre of the future' while
also using 'the past as a legitmating reference'(Ibid, p.1164). [In the
public threat horizon of future threats and dangers, proponents of cyber
fears often use historical analogies of **'electronic pearl habors'** or
**'cyber 9/11s'** in speculations on new types of threats: for the
securitization theorists, the 're-animation' of past events works to
give a 'form' or credibility to future threats that have yet to occur --
or are yet to be imagined]{.underline}.

What was significant about Hansen and Nissenbaum's essay was the way it
attempted to add new approaches and questions to [a topic that tended to
occupy a space in an often highly technical discourse of security,
technology and strategy, a discourse that extended in to all aspects of
life in a digitizing society]{.underline}. Indeed, ['everyday security
practices' in their work refers to the ways that [**individuals** and
**organizations** are integrated into]{.mark} the practices of
[**securitization** as 'both]{.mark} a **[responsible partner]{.mark}**
in fighting insecurity' [and]{.mark} also as a **[potential
threat]{.mark}**, allowing for responses that can permeate all aspects
of everyday life]{.underline} (Ibid, p.1165). [This was a discourse of
security that due to the technical complexity was presented as occupying
the 'cutting edges' of security, a zone that few outside of computer
science would be able to engage with]{.underline}. In this sense,
'technification' refers to the manner in which cybersecurity becomes a
terrain that depends on the 'expert authority' of the computer scientist
and policy expert for its legitimacy, a domain where 'the experts' are
the securitizing actors in a manner that risks to detach the issues from
critical scrutiny and dialogue. Using the case study of Estonia in
April-May in 2007 the authors illustrate how securitization theory can
bring conceptual clarity and complexity to a terrain that can either be
reduced to simplifications using the past as a means of understanding --
or taking the issues into a zone where it is beyond our means of
critical understanding and comprehension, where we feel overpowered by
our inability to engage critically with the issues, issues that can
leave us with the feeling we are in the realm of geopolitical science
fictions, a world that feels increasingly like the 'cyberpunk' novels of
William Gibson or films such as Ghost in the Shell.

Hansen and Nissenbaum reach a conclusion that resonates with the broader
objectives of securitization theory and 'critical security studies': to
develop strategies to counter and interrogate the 'exceptional' status
of security issues -- where an issue might be presented as 'exceptional'
due to the threat to the national interest and/or exceptional due to the
technical knowledge needed to evaluate the threat:

> [[**Cyber securitizations** are **particularly powerful**]{.mark}
> precisely [because they involve a **double move**]{.mark} out of the
> political realm: [from]{.mark} the [**politicized** to]{.mark} the
> **[securitized]{.mark}**, from the political [to]{.mark} the
> **[technified]{.mark}**, and it takes an inter-disciplinary effort to
> assess the implications of the move, and possibly [to counter
> it]{.mark}...cyber security stands at the intersection of multiple
> disciplines and [it is important that]{.mark} both [**analysis** and
> **academic communication** is brought to bear]{.mark} on
> it]{.underline}. The technical underpinnings of cyber security
> require, for instance, that IR scholars acquire some familiarity with
> the main technical methods and dilemmas, and vice versa that computer
> scientists become more cognizant of the politicized field in which
> they design and how their decisions might impact the (discursively
> constituted) trade-offs between security, access, trust, and privacy
> (Ibid, p. 1172).

The implication of this argument is an important one: we should develop
the tools that enable us to challenge the ethico-political dangers of
hypersecuritization in this rapidly changing (cyber) space; to be able
to see into this zone of expert knowledge and authority, the spaces
where decisions are made on the policies and technologies that will
shape all areas of war and security (see Balzacq, 2011). But this essay
asks: what should IR scholars be doing in addition to the challenge and
task -- to become more inter-disciplinary in order to be able to engage
with the potential technification and hypersecuritizations of
cybersecurity policy and discourse -- that was set out in Hansen and
Nissenbaum's article?

What we want to do in this essay is suggest that in the time since the
essay was published there may be problems and trends that have emerged
that require some additional approaches to this issue of
hypersecuritization and technification. Simply put, [[we need to think
again about]{.mark} the problems of **[cybersecurity]{.mark}** in the
'political realm']{.underline} and we need to develop research on
cybersecurity and 'political realms' in different places around the
planet; [to go [beyond the]{.mark}]{.underline} often
[**hypersecuritizing** [images of]{.mark} digital danger and
[**'otherness'** emerging from the **'nonWest'**]{.mark} to explore the
complexity of cybersecurity both from the perspective of new 'everyday
security strategies' that individuals may confront but also in terms of
the potential for 'digital disasters' that might emerge from specific
technological, legal, political and security contexts]{.underline}.

Following on from Hansen and Nissenbaum, our position in the paper
begins from the view that inter-disciplinary attempts to engage
critically with hypersecuritization is the primary task of work in this
space: [to be able [to **counter hypersecuritizations** where **threats
are 'hyped up'**]{.mark} - or unspecified **future cyber dangers** are
invoked - is the **first move** for scholars who want to think
critically about the 'threat horizons' that we are presented with on the
(not so) clear and present/future dangers]{.underline}. In the time
since the essay has been published (2009) much of the debate has centred
around the hyper securitization of the concern with all things digital
and the implications for the future of security and war (most notably in
Thomas Rid's book Cyberwar Will Not Take Place). At the same time, there
have also been events that have pointed to the possibility of the types
of future problems that we could confront -- from events that fit with
the type of warnings on digital disaster that many have been making
since the issue emerged ([the [**hacking** of **Ukrainian power
grids**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the Central Bank of Bangladesh **[bank
heist]{.mark}**]{.underline}) to the emergence of events that were not
considered in previous speculations on digital disaster (Zetter, 2016a;
Zetter, 2016b) : [attempts to shape the political direction of other
states through a combination of disruptive **['gray zone'
tactics]{.mark}** that may involve hacking [and]{.mark} new uses of
social media (the debate over **['fake news']{.mark}** and social
media]{.underline}, the U.S. Presidential election in 2016). The problem
now is not simply hypersecuritization but the problem of what Ulrich
Beck describes as 'organized irresponsibility' where the 'state
administration, politics, industrial management and research negotiate
the criteria of what is 'rational and safe.'' Discussing environmental
risks, Beck asks 'do we live in the context of 'organized
irresponsibility'?'(Beck, 1999, p.6). We would suggest the same question
needs to be asked in the context of the securitization of digital risks
and insecurities.

What we suggest in the article is this: once we have established that
the first move in this area is think critically about cyber
securitizations and the potential problems of the move from the
political to the technified, we can consider the concerns of those who
we describe as the 'cyber catastrophists' -- those who continue to be
concerned about the digital disasters that could impact on all aspects
of life. We suggest that in this realm of cybersecurity we see three
positions that shape the ideas that are contributing to vibrant debate
and discussion of the future of cyberwar and cybersecurity: the cyber
catastrophist, the digital realist and the techno optimist. The essay
rests on the position that each perspective presents us with questions
about cybersecuritizations that we need to constantly remain open to --
given the fast-moving and disruptive pace of geopolitical and
technological change. We suggest that the point in Hansen and
Nissenbaum's essay about the need to counter hypersecuritizations needs
to be supplemented by more exploratory questions about whether we
confront the issue of organized irresponsibility in this space. [The
problem of technification is not simply on how it might add legitimacy
to hypersecuritization, in what it enables us to visualize in the
imagination of digital disaster -- it is what it fails to see or
ignores, the construction and legitimation of what is rational and safe.
In other words, we need to examine the politics -- and the different
positions that may shape policy -- in the spaces where important
'expert' decisions are made: to examine, for example, how risk and
unintended consequence are being integrated into planning]{.underline}.
But the questions opened up by the 'deconstruction' of cybersecurity and
cyberwar by Hansen and Nissenbaum also point to inquiry on the changing
nature of 'everyday security practices' and here we suggest that is
[clearer now is the [need]{.mark} for [**IR scholars** to
examine]{.mark} the specific contexts, controversies and challenges in
diverse spaces **beyond** the often **[simplistic geographies of]{.mark}
cyber-threat** that often serve to **fuel** the **hypersecuritized
visions of geopolitical imaginaries**]{.underline}.

[One of the geopolitical anxieities that circulates]{.underline} in many
of the key positions we discuss [is a concern with the cyber
insecurities that we confront from the non-West or that may result from
**[poor cyber governance in the non-West]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [While
this use of the term 'non-West' can be problematic and limiting it does
remind us to think beyond the simplistic geography of 'cyber' danger
that is often central to the debates about cybersecurity, the
**geopolitical imaginary** [filled with]{.mark} devious **[Bond-
villains from former Communist-countries]{.mark}**, cunning-
**'Oriental' cyber criminals** from a cyberpunk movie, [**totalitarian
states** experimenting with]{.mark} new technologies of **[Minority
Report-like control]{.mark}** [and **'feral' digital
environments**]{.mark} in states outside the 'tame zones' of global
politics. **Securitization** perspectives -- along with work influenced
by **poststructuralist** writers -- are often a call [to see beyond
the]{.mark} simplistic **[representations of]{.mark} global politics**
that continue to imagine the future through [the same **geographies of
otherness**]{.mark} and difference [that shaped the
past]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hansen, 2006). This article suggests that --
in the spirit of Hansen and Nissenbaum's essay -- we need to keep
searching for the questions that need to be asked about a terrain that
more than ever needs to be examined in its fast moving complexity and
messiness: to examine the difference, complexity and messiness of new
trends, practices and behaviours in environments that are often ignored
or reduced to the 'same' in a supposedly homogenizing and universalising
global technological culture.

Yet, [[to treat **democratic values**]{.underline}]{.mark} or human
rights, for instance, [[as **attributes** that **specific societies
possess or acquire**]{.mark} is to **[conceal]{.mark}** the
**[intersubjective construction]{.mark}** of these concepts and to
**ignore** their **productive**, even **hegemonic power**]{.underline}.
This is the reason why Iver Neumann and Michael Williams have proposed
that [constructivist analyses of **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline}\'s
enlargement [should consider the alliance\'s self-description [as a
**'democratic security community'** **not**]{.mark} as [an
**unproblematic fact** but]{.mark} as **[a way of exercising symbolic
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Claiming a **democratic
identity**]{.mark} can then be interpreted as a political practice that
[**assigns legitimacy to NATO\'s actions** and]{.mark} at the same time
**[structures the realm of possibilities for acceptable Russian
self-conceptions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Hence, the 'capacity to claim
such identities, and to grant and deny them to others, is a source of
social power' (Williams and Neumann 2000: 364).

[[An approach that treats references]{.mark} to common Western values
[as **evidence** for an **alleged reality**]{.mark} --- the existence of
a transatlantic security community --- risks [commit]{.mark}ting [an
**essentialist fallacy**]{.mark} by taking the invocation of these
depictions at face value. One problematic consequence of such an account
is that it [becomes **methodologically impossible** to
distinguish]{.mark} between a **political assertion** of 'shared values'
and its **[performative effects]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Assuming an
already existing transatlantic security community with certain 'shared
values' and a 'collective identity' tends to reify prevalent notions of
political discourse instead of interpreting them as an element in
processes of social construction]{.underline}. In our view, [claims to a
**democratic identity of NATO**]{.underline} or public commitments to
human rights [constitute a valuable body of empirical material that
social scientists ought to be interested in]{.underline}. [However,
**instead** of treating them as **evidence for an alleged 'Western'
identity**, we suggest treating them as a distinct and **powerful move
in a political struggle**]{.underline} (Jackson 2006b). [Invocation of
'Western values' or a 'democratic identity' can then be **interpreted**
with regard to their **performative effects** and **institutional
consequences**]{.underline}.

Thus, [instead of presupposing the existence of an Atlantic security
community, we are interested in reconstructing processes of community
formation, that is, processes that lead to the evolution, reproduction
and transformation of an inter-state political space commonly described
as 'the West']{.underline} (e.g., Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005).
Just like Deutsch and his colleagues, we assume that political orders
are integrated via the construction and reproduction of a sense of
community in complex and non-linear dynamic processes. However, in
contrast to the initial work on security communities, which focused on
measuring the quantity and density of transactions, we propose that [the
emergence and the reproduction of a sense of community should be studied
by focusing on the productive power of representations in contingent
processes of signification]{.underline}. As these processes of community
formation are open ended and non-linear, they can be reconstructed from
within by interpreting how contentious references to 'the West' operate
in political discourse.

A securitising community --- theorising 'the West'

In contrast to the usual descriptions of a culturally defined 'Western
civilisation' with a stable essence, we thus start from the premise that
'the West' is first and foremost a semantic category used within
contentious processes of signification (Jackson 2006a: 3--12). ['The
West' is only real in the sense that it is used as a concept by people
who presume its existence and who act upon such a
presumption]{.underline}. [It is a 'tool to think with' that allows one
to 'characterize and classify societies into different categories ---
i.e. "western", "non-western"]{.underline}' (Hall 1992: 277). If 'the
West' constitutes a powerful semantic category that shapes action, then
discursive shifts in its meaning are of paramount importance, and its
meaning has indeed changed repeatedly throughout history. However,
strictly speaking, we are not interested in 'the West' as such but
rather in its performative power to construct politically relevant
distinctions such as between 'the West' and the 'non-West', and how
these distinctions operate in political discourse. In this vein, we
argue that [since the end of World War II, the signifier of 'the West'
has been a useful tool in the construction of a common identity because
actors could attach different meanings to it, for example, 'democratic',
'capitalist', or 'free']{.underline}. As a rather diffuse we-concept,
the proclamation of 'the West' mostly triggers associative links to
human rights, democracy, and a liberal market economy without
necessarily specifying these individual components --- let alone
discussing them in their mutual relations.

This structure of common usages of 'the West' in political discourse is
instructive from both an empirical and a normative point of view. It
seems to succeed in exerting an integrative function in transatlantic
communications precisely because it is a concept that bears a positive
normative marker both strong enough to lend legitimacy to political
claims articulated in the name of 'the West' and weak enough to avoid
the escalation of conflicts. Such an ambivalent usage of 'the West'
becomes interesting because it points to the potential and the danger of
rhetorical instrumentalisation. [[At best]{.mark}, the inherent
vagueness of 'the West' simply [leads to **unfulfilled
promises**]{.mark} because the allusive references to an impressive
phalanx of feel-good concepts remain without political
consequences]{.underline}. [In a [worse]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}
(which is at the same time more interesting from an IR point of view),
[a **[self-image]{.mark}** cast in terms [of a **community of superior
values**]{.mark} can [trigger]{.mark} processes of [**self-assertion**
and **illicit authorisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For postcolonial
scholars the concept of the 'the West' also [implies connotations [of
'**imperialistic**' and '**racist**' power and **global
domination**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

These possible consequences of usages of 'the West' direct our attention
to the question of how to identify such processes and their dynamics.
Having argued that the second generation of security community research
mainly ignored the incremental processes and open-ended dynamics of
community formation and regression, their rather static concept of
security relations has to be modified. Along these lines, most strands
of critical security studies are interested in the question of how
social interaction produces an intersubjective understanding of what
counts as a threat and what measures are considered appropriate to
provide security (Weldes et al. 1999; Buzan and Hansen 2009). Security
is seen as a social construction, a specific field of practice, or ---
as Ole Wæver has argued --- a performative act. A key merit of
securitisation theory in particular is that it introduces the
distinction between dynamics of securitisation and desecuritisation in
terms of their performative character as speech acts without
presupposing a definition of what counts as a proper security issue
(Wæver 1995; Buzan et al. 1998; Hansen 2006; Huysmans 2006). It thereby
exempts the field of security studies from a narrow focus on the defence
of alleged national interests and opens it up to a wide field of
articulations and social transactions without sacrificing conceptual
specificity.

**[Securitisation]{.underline}** theory thus [focuses on a particular
mode of political agency characterised by a **rhetoric of exception**,
which uses presumably **existential threats** as a trigger to set off
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline}. In terms of its practical
consequences, securitisation performatively engenders a state of
emergency. Working against the procedures of normal political
communication revolving around alternative courses of action,
[securitisation **reduces** the possibility of **choice** to an
**either--or** level, that is, whether we **act or not**]{.underline}.
Securitisation dynamics can lead to the authorisation of extraordinary
measures that otherwise could not have been used. Desecuritisation, by
contrast, refers to the gradual process of 'rhetorical disarmament',
which aims at the withdrawal of a particular issue off the security
agenda and replaces the logic of exception, immediate necessity and
emergency with the routinised patterns of normal politics (e.g.,
Williams 1998; Aradau 2004; Huysmans 2006). Such an understanding of
securitisation and desecuritisation as processes focuses our attention
on the practical consequences of 'speaking security'. Hence, as Ole
Wæver (1995: 54--57) has pointed out, declaring something as an issue of
security is an inherently political act with de-politicising
consequences attaching priority to the problem at hand and narrowing the
range of legitimate alternatives.

[Historically, the formation of **Western order** has typically been
**described as** such **a process of desecuritisation**, in which a
'culture of **legal formalism**']{.underline} (Koskenniemi 2001:
494--509) [has gradually replaced old-style power politics
which]{.underline}, in turn, [could be described as a network of
interconnected securitisations]{.underline}. Focusing, in particular, on
processes of securitisation and desecuritisation seems warranted as 'the
West' is increasingly portrayed as a threatened, endangered space.
Looking at the West from a security perspective that is informed by the
Copenhagen School by no means confines 'the West' to the realm of
security policy. It simply provides an angle that allows us to trace a
particular kind of transformation of Western order as a political space
by observing how different issues are being securitised or
desecuritised, that is, moved on and off the security agenda. The larger
theoretical point here is that securitisation processes are exemplary
vehicles for the transformation of order triggered through the
institutional consequences of performative acts. Securitisation,
therefore, can be regarded as an ordering mechanism that takes 'politics
beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue either as
a special kind of politics or as above politics' (Buzan et al. 1998:
23).Footnote4

In Regions and Powers, Buzan and Wæver (2003) jointly address the
question of regional security and the ordering effects of securitisation
dynamics at a regional level. Surprisingly, they take entities like
'North America', 'Asia', or 'Europe' as unproblematic givens rather than
as categories of political struggle. They clearly state that 'the
existence of an RSC (regional security complex) is not in terms of the
discursive 'construction of regions' (ibid.: 48). While, by definitional
fiat, Buzan and Wæver split the US and Europe into two different
security complexes, the long and powerful history of 'the West' stands
in sharp contrast to such a distinction, especially if we consider its
prominence as a referent object in post-9/11 securitisation dynamics,
where an immediate sense of danger was shared in both the US and Europe
precisely because the attacks were targeting 'the West' at large. Hence,
for the purpose of our project, it is important to focus precisely on
the discursive construction of political spaces and imaginative
geographies in order to understand how a Western order is
re-constituted.

So far, we have argued that securitisation triggers potentially
far-reaching institutional consequences, which may add up to a state of
emergency where the conduct of public life is subordinated to a defence
against existential threats. Institutional consequences are thus the
result of performative acts that can be understood as a form of
'creative action': social action that aims at solving problems where
routinised patterns of interpretation no longer seem to fit (Joas 1996).
In particular, framing an issue in security terms entails the pressure
to accelerate the decision-making process so that securitising moves
might add to the impression that normal procedures have become
inappropriate. In contrast to standard conceptions of order where
conflicts pose a dramatic challenge to some taken-for-granted normative
foundations, we conceive of order as an historically contingent
arrangement of institutional consequences (Wendt 1992, 1999; Herborth
2004). Here the conceptual counterpoint to order is not 'anarchy',
'chaos', 'instability', or 'institutional breakdown', whereby order is
still marked as the normatively preferable (and superior) concept
(Ashley 1988). In our understanding, order is conceptually related first
and foremost to agency in such a way that it is essentially made up of
different institutions resulting from the creativity of social
transactions. What appears to us as a relatively stable institution or a
fixed order is thus nothing but a sedimentation of routinised patterns
of signification (Dewey 1938/1991: 105--22). To the extent that such
processes of signification refer to 'contentious politics' (Tilly and
Tarrow 2007) we can encounter manifold forms of contestation and crisis
as well as cooperation among and within Western societies that may sum
up to processes of community formation. Thus, conceptualising
institutional consequences as the result of creative action enables us
to reconsider the transformation of Western order without pre-judging
whether its normative foundation is eroding or lasting. Disparate
accounts of the nature of transatlantic relations notwithstanding, the
collective wisdom of available scholarship nevertheless suggests good
reasons to assume that there may indeed be something specific to such
'Western' forms of conflict and cooperation. Yet, what precisely those
are remains open to empirical investigation.

Securitising 'The West': Three dimensions

Having emphasised, at a general theoretical level, that 'the future of
the West' hinges on contingent processes of signification rather than
transhistorical macro-dynamics, we have committed ourselves to tracing
particular instances of signification instead of partaking in
pundit-like speculations as to where 'the West' may go, get stuck, or
eventually end up. Rather we intend to reconstruct transformations of
'Western order' by focusing on the actual meanings actors attach to 'the
West'. Given limitations of space, we can only summarise the main
results of our more in-depth reconstruction of transformations of
Western order. In selecting and delimiting research areas we have been
guided by our judgment as to what is usually represented as the
characteristic and defining sets of interaction in the literature on
transatlantic relations and 'Western order'. [Most scholars]{.underline}
in the field [would contend that in order to assess current dynamics of
conflict and cooperation in transatlantic relations and in order to
appraise the status of 'the West' as a security community, one would
have to address at least three substantive issues]{.underline}.

[First]{.underline}, one would have to investigate the impact of [the
current **'power transition' with Asia** gradually displacing Europe and
North America as the centre of world politics]{.underline}. Objectors of
the 'unipolarity' thesis had first insinuated that this was about to
happen (Layne 1993; Waltz 1993; Mearsheimer 2001: 396--402; Pape 2005).
[More recently, the **[debate]{.mark}** has [evolve]{.mark}d
[into]{.mark} the more explicit question of what the '**rise**' of
states such as **China** and **Russia** would mean for the future of
'the West' and [whether 'the **l**]{.mark}**iberal
[i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder**' [could 'survive' when faced
with '**authoritarian**]{.mark} **capitalism**' as an [**alternative
model** to **liberal democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Gat 2007;
Kagan 2008; Ikenberry 2008; Deudney and Ikenberry 2009; Kupchan 2012).
Accordingly, the first research area focuses on the macro-dimension of
Western self-conceptions vis-à-vis China and Russia and
boundary-creating processes that go along with them.

The [second]{.underline} issue commonly regarded as indispensable for
assessing the present condition of transatlantic relations [is the
contested status of **NATO**]{.underline}. Whether it is regarded as an
interstate alliance that has lost its purpose (Waltz 2000: 18--27), [as
a **security community** of **liberal democracies**]{.underline}
(Risse-Kappen 1996) or else as an adaptable security management
institution (Wallander 2000), each [conceptualisation involves a
diagnosis on the main factors of transatlantic cooperation
and]{.underline}, quite often, [a diagnosis of the presumable fate of
'the West']{.underline} (cf. Hellmann 2008; Franke 2010: 19--53). The
tendency to link NATO\'s likely or unlikely survival with the 'future of
the West' more recently manifested in the debates about the consequences
of the transatlantic conflict over the war against Iraq and over the
prospects in Afghanistan (e.g., Asmus 2003; Cox 2005; Pouliot 2006;
Anderson et al. 2008). As NATO still figures prominently as the key
transatlantic security institution, the second research area will
reconsider institutional dynamics and discursive shifts relating to the
alliance.

The [third]{.underline} prominent topic in scholarly debates about 'the
West' [concerns the responses to global terrorism after
9/11]{.underline}. Frequently interpreted as a direct assault on 'the
West' and its 'way of life', [the terrorist attacks in New York,
Washington, London, and Madrid have been answered in a way that arguably
undermines the very normative foundations they are designed to
protect]{.underline}. Scholars and journalists have pointed out that the
legislative, military, and penal measures used in the 'war on terror'
directly suspend the civil rights and contradict the democratic ideals
'the West' claims for itself (Hersh 2004; Rejali 2007; Prantl 2008;
Mayer 2008). The effects of transatlantic responses to global terrorism
demarcate a field in which the traditional borders between domestic and
foreign policy problems begin to blur. The third research area therefore
refers to internal struggles in which normative requirements derived
from a particular Western self-image are confronted with the factual or
putative imperatives of preventing further terrorist attacks.

To sum up, focusing on great power rivalry with China and Russia, the
re-constitution of NATO as the primary transatlantic security
institution, and the responses to global terrorism within a 'Western
order' accesses the main sites of ongoing scholarly discussion about
transatlantic relations and 'the West'. From the point of view of a
reconstructive logic of enquiry, the selection of more specific cases
and texts within each research area was guided by internal standards as
it is recommended, for instance, by the methodology of grounded theory
(Strauss and Corbin 1998). As the method ought to fit the subject matter
rather than vice-versa, these choices need to be 'field-specific' and
continually improved and adjusted according to field-specific
experiences (ibid.; Strübing 2004). [What we found is not a single
overarching macro-dynamic under which a multitude of individual
observations could be subsumed, but rather different, **field-specific
responses** to an open-ended **tension** between two **conflicting**
principles (or **articulations**) of a **'Western order'**, namely,
**self-assertion** and **self-restraint**. In all three research areas
we reconstructed an **ongoing tension** between the **self-assertive**
dynamics of a '**securitised West**' and a **legalist culture of
formalism**]{.underline} (Koskenniemi 2001) [that imposes explicit
**limitations on the use of violence**]{.underline}.

The 'West' vis-à-vis 'Authoritarian Great Powers'

[Many books and articles have recently diagnosed an ongoing **global
transition of power** to the **detriment of 'the West'**]{.underline}.
[It has become common practice to address countries such as **Brazil**,
**Russia**, **India**, and **China** as **'rising powers'** and to
**assume** that they will **translate** their **economic growth** rates
into ever-greater **political influence** on the global
stage]{.underline}.Footnote5 The impact of the financial crisis since
2008 and the ensuing enlargement of the traditional G7/8 club into the
G20 lent further credibility to this belief. [While the ascendency of
**democratic countries** such as **Brazil** and **India** is largely
regarded as **unproblematic**, the alleged 'return of **authoritarian
great powers**' is often presented as a potential **challenge** to the
**'Western liberal order'**]{.underline} (e.g., Gat 2007). [A dominant
discourse in Europe and North America **subsumes China and Russia**
under the category of '**authoritarian great powers**' and pits them
against 'the West' in a scenario of upcoming **great power
competition**]{.underline}.

[This story with its audacious simplifications and its bold predictions
has been told many times in different variations]{.underline}, most
prominently by Robert Kagan. In his book The Return of History and the
End of Dreams, he warns against an anti-Western conspiracy, [construing
**China\'s and Russia\'s 'rise'** as an omen for an emerging
'association of autocrats' who are unfavourably disposed towards
'liberalism' and 'democracy']{.underline}. [**Assuming** **both** their
**hostile intentions** and their **successful cooperation**
allows]{.underline} him [to draw a **worst-case scenario** in which the
shape of the 'future **international order**' **hinges upon** the
determination of 'the **world\'s democracies**' to 'protect their
interests and **defend their principles** in a world in which these are
once again powerfully challenged']{.underline} (Kagan 2008: 53--59, 105,
97). [To be sure, **prophecies of imminent decline** have permeated the
discourse of 'the West' from the very beginning]{.underline} (Jackson
2010). [However, in contrast to a pessimistic]{.underline} Spenglerian
[view of history, contemporary warnings usually do not present Western
demise as an inevitable fact. They rather paint **worst-case scenarios**
that **legitimise different strategies to maintain the status
quo**]{.underline}.

In order to ascertain to what extent public--political rhetoric is
infused by this discourse, we analysed two concrete transatlantic
struggles over the right strategy to deal with China and Russia, namely,
the controversy about the European weapons embargo on China and the
debate about Russia\'s eventual membership in NATO. Both instances
featured a quite similar structure of conflict in dealing with
'authoritarian great powers'. They also revealed a strong sense of
superiority and an alert defence preparedness to be central for
processes of transatlantic community formation.

Attempts of the Chinese and Russian governments to improve security
relations with Europe and North America encountered a heterogeneous and
often discordant group of states. When individual governments proposed
to cooperate with China and Russia on the basis of national interests,
others immediately reminded them that those countries did not share
basic values and therefore did not qualify as viable partners. At the
centre of the controversy over the European Union (EU) weapons embargo
on China between 2003 and 2005 stood the question of whether a more
powerful China should be approached as an equal partner, especially
whether it could be trusted in the sensitive area of military
cooperation. The French and the German government, as well as officials
of the EU Commission, opted for great power cooperation with China and
seemed determined to go through with this plan despite stern US
objections. In the case of Russia\'s membership in NATO, policymakers in
Great Britain, Germany, and the US showed themselves open minded towards
Putin\'s 2001 proposal to put the relationship between NATO and Russia
on a new basis. In the face of terrorist threats, a fundamental
'realignment' between Europe, America, and Russia seemed possible.

Both the proponents of lifting the arms embargo on China and the
advocates of granting Russia equal participation in NATO decision making
were emphatically reminded by their partner states and their national
parliaments that they were obliged to defend identity-establishing
values that could not be sold out or be disregarded. Although security
concerns were an important element in some of these objections,
transatlantic political elites could not agree on whether these
countries posed an actual 'threat'. They did, however, ultimately reach
a consensus that security cooperation with China and Russia was only
acceptable as far as they would democratise and respect human rights.
Abstract references to these values enabled a common transatlantic
position.

The analysis of these two cases demonstrates that [there are indeed
[attempts]{.mark} by European and North American governments [to
**cooperate with China and Russia**]{.mark} on the basis of geostrategic
calculations. However, as soon as officials undertake serious steps in
this direction, they [are **disciplined by**]{.mark} **a vague
[commitment to]{.mark} a [common]{.mark} foundation of
[values]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Thus, the moral distinctiveness that
allegedly is wedded to being a part of 'the West' has to be reiterated
time and again]{.underline}. Interestingly, [this particular talk only
makes sense if there is a foil, in this case 'authoritarian great
powers']{.underline}. In both of the analysed transatlantic conflicts,
[articulations re-established and validated a normative boundary
separating China and Russia as 'authoritarian great powers' from the
liberal democracies of 'the West']{.underline}. Constructing such a
fundamental difference proves to be essential for the fabrication of a
transatlantic sense of community. In both debates, [European and North
American elites claimed to speak on behalf of a 'community of values'
that was in a position to define normative standards of universal
validity and to judge whether other countries conformed to these
standards]{.underline}. The precondition thus seemed to be an unspoken
and unquestioned consensus on two interrelated beliefs: [first, that is
was clear [how]{.mark}]{.underline} human rights and [[**democracy** had
to be understood and]{.mark}, second, [that North Americans and
Europeans carried a **special responsibility** for]{.mark} their
**[worldwide dissemination and implementation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In a nutshell, [the re-constitution of a transatlantic community is
based on an idealisation of distinct value commitments and the
consequent normative demarcation from authoritarian states such as China
and Russia. What is often described in static terms as the
'**cohesion**' of transatlantic relations proves to be [a **process of
self-affirmation** that **relies on the construction of fundamental
differences** and the **moral de-legitimation of the
'non-West'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This finding confirms postcolonial
and poststructuralist analyses of how Eurocentric patterns of thought
shape the relations between 'the West' and its Other(s). In this sense,
the attitudes and patterns of interpretation at work in processes of
'Western' community formation are just one further episode to deal in a
self-righteous way with differences in world politics. In the relations
towards China and Russia, however, an important aspect is added to the
equation. Both are regarded as powerful countries, a fact that
apparently makes it more delicate when they fail to adopt liberal
democracy as the superior model of political rule. [The [**refusal**
by]{.mark} the **[Chine]{.mark}se [and Russia]{.mark}n** governments [to
acknowledge such **universalist claims** makes them **appear**
as]{.mark} incalculable or even **[hostile
opponents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**China** apparently is about to **surpass liberal countries in
economic development** without the anticipated democratic reforms taking
place]{.underline}. [**Russia** in turn is attributed with the potential
to **provoke** Eastern European countries **militarily** or
**blackmail** them **economically**]{.underline}. When the prospects for
a transformation of these countries seem to diminish, the
self-confidence of North American and European elites easily turned into
the fear that precious normative achievements may be in danger and must
be defended against possible assaults. Thus, [when it comes to China and
Russia, the already present sense of **superiority** combines with
diffuse fears of a **shrinking material power** basis for projecting
allegedly universal norms and institutions]{.underline}. [As a result, a
**morally superior** but **materially declining** **'West'** is called
upon to **safeguard the liberal international order** before it falls
prey to 'rising' authoritarian great powers]{.underline}. This is the
case-specific [pull towards]{.underline} the
**[securitisation]{.underline}** pole. [The **normative demarcation**
vis-à-vis unpredictable and **morally questionable authoritarian great
powers** [engender a **latent confrontational posture**]{.mark} against
these states. [**As long** as they have **not transformed into liberal
democracies**]{.mark}, their moves tend to be [observed with **fearful
scepticism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In sum, a strong sense of superiority, which is semantically linked to
the notion of 'the West', provides the basis for diffuse threat
scenarios in transatlantic discourse on 'authoritarian great powers'.
[The idea [that **non-Western others** might propose acceptable
alternatives]{.mark} to existing rules and institutions [is **hard to
reconcile** with]{.mark} the **[self-conception]{.mark}** of European
and North American elites [as]{.mark} representing **[the vanguard of
the]{.mark} political and [moral development of
humankind]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This self-conception
**[predisposes]{.mark}** these elites [to **interpret**]{.mark} those
**Chinese and Russian positions, which run counter to such pretensions**
either as '[**challenges**' for]{.mark} the stability of the
**'[l]{.mark}iberal [i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder'** or even
[as]{.mark} potential long-term **[security threats to 'the
West']{.mark}** as a community of values]{.underline}.

NATO\'s strategic discourse and the self-authorisation of 'the West'

While the first research area dealt with representations of
'authoritarian regimes' that are by definition categorised as being
outside of the boundaries of 'the West', this research area focuses on
the transformation of NATO, that is, the military alliance that is
considered to be the institutional core of what we usually call 'the
West' (e.g., Gress 2004; Brzezinski 2009). Obviously, [**transatlantic
security cooperation** has been a classical theme]{.underline} in IR,
[either from a **realist** vantage point, where NATO is primarily
described as a defence alliance subordinated to national
purposes]{.underline} (Waltz 2000: 18), [or from a **liberal**
perspective, where **NATO** is understood as an **alliance of
democracies**]{.underline} (Risse-Kappen 1995: 4). [In **both**
perspectives, however, the dynamics of **[security coop]{.mark}eration**
between North America and Europe [**seem unproblematic** as long
as]{.mark} the [allies are convinced of]{.mark} their [**common
interest** or]{.mark} their **[shared values]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**NATO**\'s (lasting) ability to voice
**[in-/securities]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- [for]{.underline} example a
'Soviet threat', 'terrorism', or **['new challenges']{.underline}** ---
[directs our attention to **highly institutionalised** dynamics of
**securitisation** that]{.underline}, as the subsequent analysis will
show, [[manifest]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves [[as]{.mark} a
[**self-authorisation** of **'the West'**]{.mark} in order [to **defend
its normative foundation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such a tendency
towards self-authorisation has become visible in different
forms]{.underline} since the North Atlantic alliance was founded in
1949. During the Cold War, [it primarily **enabled** a rather deep
institutionalisation of **military cooperation** with an integrated
command structure including US **nuclear weapons**, as well as common
strategic planning and defence exercises]{.underline}. After the Cold
War, this project was continued but it has certainly changed in form.
[**Out-of-area operations** and the development of a **globally** active
alliance is one of the most visible expressions of such
**self-authorising practices**]{.underline}. These dynamics were central
to re-constitute NATO during critical junctures [and have been
**productive** of a **highly self-confident** Western alliance
today]{.underline} (Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005; Behnke 2013).

The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in April 1949 by representatives of
nine Western European states, Iceland, Canada, and the US, provided the
Western alliance with a legal basis and outlined the key principles of
cooperation, that is, consultation (Article 4) and collective defence
(Article 5). Although the formulation of Article 5 was highly contested
between the US and its European allies, it was perceived as the
cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation (Kaplan 2004: 4). In
contrast to such a legal framing of Western security cooperation, the
preamble of the Treaty invoked an inherently normative rhetoric when it
stated that the parties 'are determined to safeguard the freedom, common
heritage and civilization of their people, founded on the principle of
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law' (The North Atlantic
Treaty 1949). [The construction of unity based on a common culture and
even **'civilisation'** (rather than merely a **shared threat
perception**) transferred **military cooperation** and integration **far
beyond an interest-driven alliance**]{.underline} (e.g., Klein 1990;
Jackson 2003, 2006a). During these formative years of NATO, one central
aim of formulating 'strategic concepts' was to construct a common
security interest of the US and Western European states that was
metaphorically framed in terms of an 'indivisibility of allied
security'.Footnote6

Bearing these normative foundations in mind, NATO gradually evolved as a
cultural project that was directed against communism --- which made the
inclusion of an autocratic state such as Portugal possible --- rather
than as a community of democratic states (Klein 1990; Jackson 2003;
Sjursen 2004). [The **invoked narrative** of **shared norms, values**,
and a common heritage provided a sufficiently strong **rationale** for
defending the North Atlantic Area against **any potential
threat**]{.underline}. Moreover, [it also **[legitimised taking whatever
measures were deemed 'necessary']{.mark}** to defend its
members]{.underline}. ['[**Forward defence**' and '**massive
retaliation**']{.mark} turned out to be such legitimate
means]{.underline}. Nevertheless, in many ways the strength of Western
rhetoric was also intended to polish over and counterbalance many of the
underlying political conflicts that persisted throughout NATO\'s
post-war history. As a matter of fact, over the years it had become a
standard formula in political discourse to refer to an alliance in
'crisis' as proof of its uniquely transatlantic vitality. In this sense
[the **invocation** of a normative foundation of **shared 'Western'
values**]{.underline}, heritage [and **civilisation** even against the
background of **internal political dissent** was as much a
**securitising move** as it was an expression of a particular 'Western'
structure of conflict]{.underline}. One could conclude that
[**transatlantic security cooperation** was **only manageable by
invoking such a normative foundation** of shared values, heritage, and
civilisation]{.underline}.

The subsequent strategic concepts DC 6/1 (December 1952), MC 14/2 (May
1957) and the amended strategic guidelines were written with the
intention to both 'convince the USSR that war does not pay' (NATO 1950)
and to reassure the allies that continued and even intensified that
security cooperation was necessary. Changing strategic concepts, most
prominently from 'massive retaliation' to 'flexible response', restored
the reliability of mutual defence because of altered security
circumstances (e.g., Haftendorn 1996; Tuschhoff 1999; Kaplan 2004: 100).
Although the concept of 'flexible response' eventually satisfied all
allies and remained valid until the end of the Cold War, different
interpretations of deterrence and its operational implications persisted
(Daalder 1991: 41; Risse-Kappen 1995: 184--7). Once again a particular
structure of conflict among NATO allies was observable in the sense that
although a 'crisis' occurred, references to the common heritage, shared
norms and values of the 'free world' restored sufficient coherence among
them. In this sense, the decision over West Germany\'s membership in
1955, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the withdrawal of France from the
integrated military command structure in 1966, or NATO\'s double track
decision in 1979 were all incidents of alliance disruption that
nevertheless did not lead to a break-up of the Atlantic alliance. In
these situations strategic concepts turned out to be crucial in
re-establishing coherence and unity by reaffirming the authority of the
alliance and its ability to (re-)act. The strengthening of consultation
mechanisms in the 1950s, the formation of 'Allied Mobile Forces' (AMF)
in the 1960s, or the deployment of additional Pershing II missiles in
the 1980s embodied the institutional consequences of these strategic
re-orientations.

With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, many commentators expected that
the Atlantic alliance would sooner or later vanish as well. Thus,
NATO\'s post-Cold War strategies of 1991 and 1999 were primarily aimed
at justifying the institutional continuity of the Western alliance
against the new setting of a decreasing Eastern threat (e.g., Ringsmose
and Rynning 2009: 5). At the beginning of the 1990s, 'Europe, whole and
free' (The Alliance\'s New Strategic Concept 1991) became the obvious
new rhetorical commonplace to legitimise a different future for NATO
compared with the fate of the Warsaw Pact. It opened up the possibility
of Eastern enlargement and paved the way for the institutionalisation of
a new relationship with Russia (Wallander 2000; Williams and Neumann
2000; Schimmelfennig 2003; Adler 2008; Pouliot 2008) as well as
initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean (Masala 2003).

In the same vein of institutional and geographical expansion, the
'out-of-area' debate in the mid-1990s rearticulated the necessity for a
political and military engagement far beyond alliance territory and
territorial defence.Footnote7 [While the bipolar confrontation of the
Cold War had largely constrained the alliance\'s global military
engagement, 'safeguarding the freedom, common heritage and
**civilisation**' now ascribed a **global mission** to NATO\'s
members]{.underline}. [Instead of supporting a culture of
**self-restraint** and **legal formalism**, the allies even
**intensified** a tendency towards **self-authorisation** in the name of
defending]{.underline} human rights and [the achievements of **'Western
civilisation'**]{.underline}. [**Disregarding U**nited **N**ations'
**formal legal provisions** in the case of **Kosovo**]{.underline}, NATO
itself became a producer of a common law where the protection of human
rights was deemed more important than respecting state sovereignty and
non-intervention. [The specific formation of NATO\'s strategic discourse
made such **'humanitarian interventions'** intelligible as the new
raison d'être]{.underline}. [Public justifications for military
interventions in **Serbia** or **Afghanistan**, for example, cited the
attack on **'Western' values** as a **determining reason** for taking
**military action**]{.underline}. Ultimately, in its statement on
terrorism, the North Atlantic Council said that 'the lives of our
citizens, and their human rights and civil liberties' were threatened by
terrorism and reaffirmed that the allies 'condemn terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations. We, the 19 NATO Allies, are determined to
combat this scourge. Our security requires no less' (NATO
2001).Footnote8

[During the Cold War, such a project of **self-authorisation** was
primarily realised by **institutionalising** an **integrated command**
structure, **coordinated defence planning** and **common
exercises**]{.underline}. [Today, the [**rhetoric** of **unpredictable
risks**]{.mark} and the global war on terrorism [assigns]{.mark} an
almost [**universal authority** to **NATO**]{.mark}, in particular when
'the challenge is **not just** to make our populations **secure**, but
**feel secure**']{.underline} (de Hoop Scheffer 2009, emphasis added).
'Europe' and [the 'transatlantic area' is the endangered subject of
NATO\'s strategic discourse [justifying]{.mark} a durable and
**institutionally dense [military coop]{.mark}eration** of its member
states [and]{.mark} a [**nuclearisation** of]{.mark} its **[defence
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Whenever allies pursued (national)
security policies without consultation, conflicts and crisis within the
alliance ensued. It was **only through NATO** that **'the West'** could
**materialise its power position** through a specific form of
**self-authorisation**]{.underline}. [**NATO**, respectively Western
states, presented **'democracy'**]{.underline}, 'human rights', [the
**'rule of law'**, and **'market economy'** as **normatively
unquestioned** principles they had **already realised**]{.underline}.
[**Others** had **only one choice:** to **comply** or to
**resist**]{.underline}. [The normative attractiveness of 'the
West']{.underline}, thus, also [directs]{.underline} our attention to
[the temptations of [**securitising practices** where]{.mark} a
formalisation of IR through [**law is marginalised** by **unilateral
acts of self-authorisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Western 'War on Terror': Torture and extraordinary rendition

At first sight, NATO\'s self-authorising tendencies and Western claims
to universality might stand in sharp contrast to how 'the West' is
commonly perceived in its more favourable readings. Among the broad
array of Western self-descriptions, allegiance to the rule of law stands
out as a bedrock principle. The difference between the 'West and the
rest' (Hall 1992) can be accounted for in many different ways, yet the
normative quality of a distinctive set of legal--political routines
stands out as the one most commonly in use. Considerations of due
process and the legal writ of habeas corpus are more than derivative
characteristics, they --- rather than military strength or an advanced
form of capitalist organisationFootnote9 --- are held to define Western
societies and states as such.

Unlawful detention, extraordinary rendition, and torture would thus seem
to constitute an obvious and flagrant violation of the normative
infrastructure of 'the West'. Moreover, yet all of this did take place
in the wake of 'Western' responses to the atrocities of 9/11 that are
now by convention referred to as the global 'war on
terrorism'.Footnote10 To the extent that such transgressions were
justified in a language of necessity, we seem to encounter a showcase
example of securitisation. Both the symbolic value of targeting the
Pentagon and the World Trade Center, and the subsequent narratives of
justification issued by Al-Qaeda, signify that this was not an attack
directed against the US as a state, but more broadly an attack on 'the
West' at large. Defending 'the West' and its unique form of life then
might even justify torture --- and paradoxically the defence of the
'West' thus invoked becomes in itself a threat to 'the West' in its own
right, undermining the very principles it set out to protect.Footnote11

Hence, the interesting research question here is not whether torture and
extraordinary rendition constitute instances of securitisation --- they
obviously do. The challenge is rather to reconstruct carefully the ways
in which such securitisation dynamics play out, what institutional
consequences they yield, what patterns of justification they involve,
and how they contribute to transforming the normative infrastructure of
'the West'. What is at stake, then, is a reconstruction of the
legal--political ramifications of torture and extraordinary rendition,
not the question of whether transgressions have taken place and whether
this conforms to antecedent expectations of securitisation theory. We
know that democracies do torture. As Darius Rejali (2007) has shown in
great detail, democracies have not abolished torture but rather made it
invisible by inventing 'stealth techniques', which leave no trace.
Interrogation techniques such as waterboarding are thus, in an
irritating way, specifically democratic forms of torture. They respond
to the legal and public constraints imposed on such practices by norms
against torture by removing them from the public eye. In fact, this
pattern holds for all of the 'techniques' discussed in the notorious
torture memosFootnote12 --- dietary manipulation, nudity, the attention
grasp, walling, the facial hold, the facial slap or insult slap, cramped
confinement, wall stranding, stress position, water dousing, sleep
deprivation of more than 48 hours, and the waterboard. The very term
applied to such measures, 'enhanced interrogation techniques', testifies
to a specific trait of what Rejali calls 'clean torture'. None of them
leaves a visible mark, none of them seems as outrageously brutal as
medieval forms of torture, and thus they provide a comfortable degree of
deniability to those in authority.

Hence, it is all the more important to focus on how specific
'techniques' have been administered and how this has been justified. 'In
the study of torture', Rejali (2007: 63) rightly observes, 'hell is in
the details'. One of the detailed questions raised in the torture memos
concerns the 'Combined Use of Certain Techniques'. Having stipulated
that each of the single 'techniques' listed above does not constitute a
violation of the anti-torture statute, the 'Memorandum for John A.
Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency. Re:
Application of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340-2340A to the Combined Use of Certain
Techniques in the Interrogation of High Value Al-Qaeda Detainees\'
discusses the question of how things may change when several of these
techniques are used in combination. If sleep deprivation of more than 48
hours is not considered to be legally problematic, then how about sleep
deprivation in combination with cramped confinement, dietary
manipulation, and repeated insult slaps? The way in which the question
is posed in the torture memos presupposes that this is all about
navigating a legal grey zone, where an imaginary torture threshold must
not be crossed in order to avoid legal repercussions. Within the
rationality of the torture memos it is very possible that any particular
combination of techniques does not constitute torture in a legal sense.
It is also very possible that any particular combination of techniques
does constitute torture in a legal sense. It all becomes a question of
dosage. Here the memos are being unspecific in a very specific way. What
we can observe is an instance of intra-institutional buck-passing, which
exempts both the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department
of Justice from being charged with explicitly advocating or conducting
torture. From the point of view of the CIA, they just did what was
explicitly authorised by the Department of Justice; from the point of
view of the Department of Justice, ultimately crossing the torture
threshold would have to take place in specific instances of
interrogation and thus under the auspices of the CIA. A middle ground is
achieved when the memo calls for 'trained interrogators'. 'Trained
interrogators' are individuals capable of understanding what precise
dosage and combination of such 'techniques' can be administered in order
to remain on the safe side of legality. Hence, from the point of view of
both the CIA and the Department of Justice, transgressions can be
attributed to a situative misjudgement on the side of the trained
interrogator. The buck finally stops amidst a newly inaugurated class of
torture professionals, which specialises in remaining invisible to any
form of public and legal scrutiny.

Such a logic of self-immunisation repeats itself at the transatlantic
level. We know that CIA flights transported suspects to foreign
detention camps, that they used European airports and European
infrastructure, and that apparently some of those camps were located in
Eastern member states of the EU. As a matter of fact, and contrary to a
public self-image that Europeans occasionally tend to cast, Europe has
been integral in practices of torture and extraordinary rendition in the
wake of the global war on terror. The relevant information is contained
in a report by Dick Marty, a Swiss representative to the Council of
Europe, on 'Alleged Secret Detentions and Unlawful Inter-state Transfers
Involving Council of Europe Member States\'. Yet, while stirring up a
great deal of public interest, the report was ultimately of little
consequence. It fell victim to the problem it described. In the wake of
an effective buck-passing of political responsibility, all it could do
was diligently compile information that had already been available in
the news media. The major finding of the report --- that there were
indeed secret detentions and extraordinary renditions, yet no one was
accountable for them --- defined precisely the limit of the report\'s
political effect. The transatlantic division of labour thus operates
much like the division of labour between the CIA and the Department of
Justice. From the point of view of the US, Europe is not quite living up
to its commitments to burden sharing, being only of tacit and reluctant
help. Hence, the US has to carry most of the weight in the war on
terror, and, by implication, needs 'to get her hands dirty'. From a
European point of view, the factual degree of involvement comfortably
pales in comparison with US transgressions. From the moral high ground,
then, how precisely Europe has been and still is involved becomes almost
invisible. Both Europe and the United States can cast their definitions
of the situation in terms of 'the West'. Europe holds up Western values
damaged in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and Fallujah. The US, on the other
hand, actually does defend 'the West'. In between such conflicting
understandings of 'the West', political accountability evaporates.

[This is precisely how a political logic of risk management]{.underline}
Footnote13 [operates: by **delegating away political responsibilities**
to anonymous layers of **technocratic** and **expertocratic**
competency]{.underline}, all the more clandestine if intelligence
agencies are involved. [The **depoliticising effect** of
**securitisation** is thus **routinised** and tacitly
institutionalised]{.underline}. [Rather than a **situative response** to
a **particular threat**, which may be **countered and then go away**,
the practical consequences of **securitisation** can thus be extended
for an **indefinite** period of time --- by **translating** the
**hyper-political logic of security** into a **bureaucratic logic of
risk management**]{.underline}.

Conclusions

[**Giving up on an essentialist conceptualisation** and **focusing
instead** on **performative references** to and invocations of **'the
West'** by no means dilutes the resulting image]{.underline}, as
essentialisers often seem to fear. On the contrary, it was only through
an open, reconstructive focus on manifold and fragmented uses of the
West that we could render visible a dynamic of genuinely 'Western'
securitisation. [Different articulations in scholarly and political
discourse do not add up to a coherent entity that can then be tagged as
'the West'. Rather, **'the West'** is quite literally an **essentially
contested concept** as it becomes **politically efficacious** only to
the extent that it is articulated in specific, locally and contextually
circumscribed situations]{.underline}. [However, all]{.underline} three
[research fields support the conclusion that 'the West' tends to be
marked as normatively valuable and preferable to that which is not
Western]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**to the extent that it is cast as a
threatened entity** that ought to be **defended at all cost**, that is,
**to the extent** that **'the West' is being securitised**, it **assumes
the role** of a discursive attractor, as if it were a '**gravitational
centre**' that **channels political communication through a
securitisation filter**. With a 'securitised West' looming in the
background, transatlantic discord might not escalate to the point of
open conflict and antagonism but might rather remain tied to a
particular structure of conflict, in which different articulations of
how precisely 'the West' ought to be defended are at stake]{.underline}.

References to 'the West' as a carrier of collective identity, then,
account for the rapid build-up of rhetorical heat, yet these very
references also delimit the possible scope of antagonism. At the same
time, however, [as a self-securitising community 'the West' exerts a
**discursive pull**, which places the semantics of security and thus the
**authorisation of extraordinary measures** squarely at the centre of
political conduct. Self-assertion, **self-authorisation**, and
self-immunisation are just three **institutional consequences** of such
a **securitisation pull**. In the case of **NATO**, these dynamics of
**self-authorisation** seem to be most obvious regarding the
**reconstituting effects** of its **strategic discourse** and its global
projection of (military) power today]{.underline}. The debate on
'China\'s rise' and its consequences for the coherence and future of
'the West' brings to mind the potential differences between the US and
European states where references to assumed universal values might
enhance a self-assertion of 'the West'. In the field of torture and
extraordinary renditions we can observe how the very principles of 'the
West' are undermined by the bureaucratic self-immunisation against
political accountability.

Obviously, [the **[freelance authorisation of]{.mark} means of
[violence]{.mark}** in the wake of securitisation processes and the
accompanying tendencies of self-assertion and self-immunisation are
[**diametrically opposed** to]{.mark} the **[self-understanding]{.mark}
of 'the West'** [as]{.mark} a community of **[liberal
democracies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nested in such self-descriptions,
processes of securitisation cannot be conceptualised as a one-way
street, where a secular trend of militant depoliticisation relentlessly
rolls over whatever modest barriers to the unilateral use of force have
been erected. By prioritising executive authorisation and a technocratic
output orientation, securitisation dynamics invoke, if only negatively,
a legal--democratic 'culture of formalism' (Koskenniemi 2001, 2009),
which insists on input legitimation, due process norms, and a rigid
oversight of executive authority. [Bearing this in mind, both
securitisation and desecuritisation can be framed as uniquely and
characteristically Western projects. Hence, **Western securitisation**
dynamics can only be understood as a **discursive [shift]{.mark}**
[**away** from a **legal**]{.mark}**ly enshrined** [culture of
**restraint**]{.mark} and [towards]{.mark} self-reinforcing processes of
**dramatisation** and **[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other
words, [while processes of **securitisation** are indeed **dangerously
self-reinforcing**, they **do not operate in a vacuum**, thus triggering
escalation spirals and a contact surface for public counter-reactions at
the same time. They are **nested** not in a fixed set of shared values,
but rather in a distinctly **Western structure of conflict** where
**securitisation** dynamics and the **desecuritising safeguards** of
legal formalism stand in **polar opposition**. As discursive attractors
they constitute **gravitational centres** in an open force field of
**social interaction**. They **provide alternative rationales and
justification narratives**, which collide in everyday political
practice. **Whether securitisation dynamics successfully trump attempts
at politicisatio**n, democratisation, or constitutionalisation is **a
matter of open-ended social struggles** where **each discursive shift
alters a complex relational configuration**, thus **opening up new
avenues of contestation**]{.underline}.

[Historically contingent and reversible as it may be, however, in
all]{.underline} three [cases we do observe a significant bias towards
more assertive forms of self-authorisation to the detriment of
formal-legal restraint]{.underline}. [At present, the securitisation
pull seems to be stronger than the appeal of what used to be hailed as
core commitments of the Western community of states]{.underline}.
Specifically, [**to the extent** that the institutional infrastructure
of **the West revolves centrally around NATO** as a classical security
institution turned global security player, **institutional reform** is
**predicated on imaginaries of the relative geopolitical position of
'the West'**]{.underline}. [As **China**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline}
probably **[Russia]{.underline}**) [are being portrayed not only as
competitors but as potential **threats to Western
supremacy**]{.underline}, realist [**sticks** may **gain more leverage**
than]{.underline} liberal [**carrots** in Western external
relations]{.underline}. [**Internally**, the **'securitised West'**
further **undermines** what used to be hailed as **its normative
foundation** **in the name of inevitable steps towards its
defence**]{.underline}. In short, Western integration [operates less on
the basis of shared norms and values of liberal democracies and **more
and more** through the **institutionalisation of
paranoia**]{.underline}.

### L -- Disease

#### Securitizing disease is a means of [threat projection]{.underline} on the non-West that causes the imposition of [violent management mechanisms]{.underline}\-\--it also [turns the case]{.underline} by pushing responses away from civil society, causing the state to hoard treatment, and overfocusing on specific threats at the expense of general health

Global health

Health issues have also received growing attention, notably as a result
of the dramatic increase in the volume and density of global forms of
mobility, which have affected global pandemics.142 [[Scholars]{.mark}
have mainly [focused on]{.mark} the normative]{.underline} and
methodological [dimensions of the [securitization of health]{.mark}
issues]{.underline}. The normative question has taken the following
form: should health problems be securitized? The methodology-related
enquiries have questioned what accounts for the success of securitizing
moves concerning health issues. The answers provided to these questions
have also had broader implications for securitization theory.

Elbe highlights, for instance, the normative dilemma inherent to the
securitization of HIV/AIDS.143 [On the one hand, [securitization
has]{.mark} the [benefits]{.mark} of [raising
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}, which enables a wider recognition of the
deleterious effects of the issue and a more resolute commitment of
resources in order to curb the pandemic. [[On the other hand,
securitization]{.mark} also [carries costs]{.mark}. One is that the
[securitization]{.mark}]{.underline} of HIV/AIDS [[could lead to a
**massive state involvement** obscuring]{.mark} the role of [other
actors]{.mark}. For example, [responses to]{.mark} the [disease could be
'**pushed away from civil society** toward military]{.mark} and
intelligence [organizations]{.mark} with the power to
override]{.underline} the [civil liberties]{.underline} of persons with
HIV/AIDS'.144 [[A]{.mark}nother [negative feature]{.mark}
of]{.underline} the [securitization]{.underline} of HIV/AIDS
[[is]{.mark} the [activation of a **'threat-defence
logic'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Particularly in developing countries,
[[armed forces]{.mark} would [receive]{.mark} high [priority for]{.mark}
medical [treatment]{.mark}]{.underline}. It can therefore be concluded
that securitizing an issue should not be the a priori preferred option.
Thus, one of the strengths of securitization theory is that it
highlights the ['normative choices]{.underline} that [are always
involved in **framing**]{.underline} issues as security issues and \[...
warns\] of potential dangers inherent in doing so'.145

In addition, Youde argues that [the [disadvantages]{.mark} of
securitizing health issues]{.underline}, in general, and the avian flu,
in particular, [**['strongly outweigh]{.mark}** the
[positives']{.mark}]{.underline}.146 He builds his argument upon
detailed empirical analysis of official statements and identifies three
main costs of the securitization of avian flu. [First, the
[securitization]{.mark} of avian flu [can **mobilize inappropriate
responses**]{.mark}, as it leads to health issues being addressed with
traditional security means, such as armed forces. Second, securitization
can [prompt governments to devote]{.mark} a [disproportionate]{.mark}
amount of [resources to]{.mark} counter [a specific threat at the
**expense of tackling other issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}.147 [An
[extreme focus on]{.mark} a single [disease can]{.mark} **actually
[render a state]{.mark} particularly [vulnerable to other
threats]{.mark}**[, as]{.mark} its bureaucratic [structures and]{.mark}
human and financial [assets]{.mark} all become [focused]{.mark} on an
'absolute priority'. Third,]{.underline} Youde argues that the
[securitization]{.underline} of avian flu [has worsened the gap between
Western states and the rest of the world. [By]{.mark} often [blaming the
South for spreading]{.mark} the disease, [Western states]{.mark} have
**[imposed]{.mark} their [anxieties]{.mark}**, perception of the problem
[and]{.mark} **specific [management mechanisms]{.mark}** [upon the Third
World]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### L -- Economy/Trade

#### Dystopian threats of economic and trade collapse are a [tired interventionist script]{.underline} that repeat [reductive]{.underline} and [Orientalist]{.underline} claims to justify full-spectrum military dominance

**Morrissey 15 --** Dr. John Morrissey, Professor in the School of
Geography and Archaeology at the National University of Ireland, PhD in
Geography at the University of Exeter, "Securitizing Instability: The US
Military and Full Spectrum Operations", Environment and Planning D:
Society and Space, Volume 33, p. 614-618

[The remit of **[securitizing]{.mark}** political economy]{.underline}
under the broad sign of 'stability operations' [features]{.underline}
even more [prominently]{.underline} in the subsequent joint publication
of the US Department of State and the US Joint Warfighting Center on the
emergent framework of US overseas reconstruction and stabilization
strategy. In it, "American military power" is tasked with "vital roles"
in the full spectrum of "peace, crisis, and conflict", and the following
[[**economic** mechanisms]{.mark} are underscored]{.underline} at length
[as "essential components" of intervention to be supported: "**bilateral
and multilateral economic relations**", the "commercial sector",
"**[trade]{.mark}**", "**f**oreign **d**irect **i**nvestment",
"sanctions", "regulatory frameworks", and "policy towards international
financial institutions"]{.underline} (US Department of State and US
Joint Warfighting Center, 2005, pages 33--34). In support of these and
other interventionary components under the umbrella of 'stability
operations', the US government was not slow in committing additional DoD
funding. Just over a month after Directive 3000.05 was issued, the
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (Section 1206)
authorized the spending of up to \$200 million per annum by military
commanders on the ground to train and equip foreign military forces for
stability operations and counterinsurgency (Congressional Research
Service, 2008, page 2). This was increased to \$300 million the
following year and \$500 million by 2011. All of this occurred in
addition to the initiation of CERP in postinvasion Afghanistan and Iraq
to "meet urgent humanitarian relief requirements or urgent
reconstruction requirements" (US Army Judge Advocate General's Legal
Center, 2013, page 238). Between 2004 and 2010, Congress approved almost
\$4 billion for CERP in Iraq and over \$1.6 billion in Afghanistan
(Morrison Taw, 2012a, page 133).(7)

As a legal-policy directive, Directive 3000.05 also assumes a certain
organizational salience within the US military, and this appears to be
playing out in military doctrine, education, and training. At the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey, California, for instance, the School of
International Graduate Studies launched a new Center for Stabilization
and Reconstruction Studies in late 2004, to complement its existing
Center for Civil-- Military Relations established ten years earlier.
They now offer dedicated curriculums on 'stabilization and
reconstruction', 'strategic studies', and 'civil--military relations',
and run MA and PhD programs in security studies comprising modules such
as: 'war and its impact on postconflict reconstruction'; 'economic
development for security building'; and 'stability operations' (Naval
Postgraduate School, 2013). Elsewhere, Air Force officers too are being
increasingly equipped with expertise that overlaps economics, law, and
strategic studies (Air Force Academy, 2013). In terms of revised field
operations, the Army and the Marine Corps jointly published their much
heralded Counterinsurgency field manual in late 2006, which referenced
at length the importance of stability operations in training and
overseas interventions (US Army and US Marine Corps, 2006).(8) And in
2008 the US Army published a new version (the first since the September
11th attacks in 2001) of its capstone doctrine, Field Manual (FM) 3-0:
Operations, which outlined the new elevated role of stability
operations. (7) Although some of these monies were used for the
establishment of such initiatives as Provincial Reconstruction Teams,
much of it ended up being used for buying short-term local security
support (Bachman, 2010; Patrick and Brown, 2007).

\(8\) In 2009 the Joint Chiefs of Staff published Joint Publication
3-24: Counterinsurgency Operations on behalf of the five core military
branches of the DoD, the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast
Guard. It was revised in November 2013. Soon thereafter, they published
a follow-up manual specifically on stability operations, FM 3-07:
Stability Operations (US Department of the Army, 2008a; 2008b).

It is worth considering in some detail the envisioning of stability
operations in these two instructive US Army field manuals. Operations
begins by declaring that not only is "America at war", but "it should
remain fully engaged for the next several decades in a persistent
conflict against an enemy dedicated to U.S. defeat as a nation and
eradication as a society" (US Department of the Army, 2008a, page viii).
[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[**doomsday dystopia** established,
it]{.mark} then]{.underline} sets out stability operations as "as
important as---or more important than---offensive and defensive
operations", and [[envisages **'full spectrum
operations'**]{.underline}]{.mark} as a historic and revolutionary shift
from "an 'either--or' view of combat and other operations to an
inclusive doctrine that emphasized the essentiality of nonlethal actions
with combat actions" (US Department of the Army, 2008a, pages
vii--viii). With the publication of Operations, the US Army formally
adopted full spectrum operations as its new broader military doctrine,
which it defined in its subsequent 2009 Posture Statement:

""Full spectrum operations apply combat power through simultaneous and
continuous combinations of four elements: offense, defense, stability,
and civil support. The Army must defeat enemies and simultaneously shape
the civil situation through stability or civil support operations. ...
The Army recognizes that the new century is characterized by 'persistent
conflict' that will test Soldiers and the Nation for an unknown period"
(US Department of the Army, 2009, no page number).

Presumably, one of the ways in which soldiers will be tested is in
taking on the new responsibilities of full spectrum operations, such as
"economic stabilization and infrastructure", "restoring economic
production and distribution", and "initiating market reform", as
outlined in Operations (US Department of the Army, 2008a, page 3-16).
Throughout the course of the document, however, none of these
responsibilities are detailed in any significant way. In Stability
Operations the US Army's broader mission "to generate 'soft' power to
promote participation in government, spur economic development, and
address the root causes of conflict among the disenfranchised
populations of the world" is initially announced (US Department of the
Army, 2008b, page C2). To this end, a "comprehensive approach to
stability operations" is then proclaimed, which "integrates the tools of
statecraft with our military forces, international partners,
humanitarian organizations, and the private sector"--- all in the name
of an "American policy of internationalism" that "promotes political and
economic freedom" (US Department of the Army, 2008b, pages C2, 1-10).
Across six chapters, Stability Operations subsequently elaborates the US
Army's new doctrinal approach to stability operations. Although vague in
detail throughout, [the word 'economic' is the overwhelmingly dominant
adjective describing stability operations and responsibilities,
appearing over 200 times]{.underline} (more than the combined total for
'political', 'social', 'moral', 'ethical', and 'environmental').
Supporting 'economic and infrastructure development, furthermore, is
outlined as one of five 'primary stability tasks', the other four
related tasks being 'essential services', 'civil security', 'civil
control', and 'governance' (US Department of the Army, 2008b, chapter
3). In addition, the legal architectures of occupation and
reconstruction are posited as critical, as "legal framework development
makes the legal and regulatory changes necessary to enable
organizations, institutions, and individuals at all levels and in all
sectors to perform effectively and to build their capacities" (US
Department of the Army, 2008b, page 1-8, 1-9). The other point to note
in Stability Operations is the positioning of ['exceptional'
practices]{.underline} which [further enable military intervention under
'extreme circumstances']{.underline} where, for example, "the
host-nation government has failed completely or an enemy regime has been
deposed"; in such a case, the "intervening authority has a legal and
moral responsibility to install a transitional military authority" (US
Department of the Army, 2008b, page 5-1).

[Stability Operations begins with [a **bleak**]{.mark} **geopolitical
[envisioning]{.mark}** involving necessary US military global
leadership. A world replete with "societal abysses", "precipitous
divides", and a "fundamental clash of ideologies and cultures" [is
**scripted for**]{.mark} **a future of "[persistent conflict]{.mark}**
against enemies intent on limiting American access and influence
throughout the world"; [meanwhile]{.mark}, Global South [development
is]{.mark} effectively **posited as [a nuisance]{.mark}** for the United
States]{.underline} (US Department of the Army, 2008b, page vi). [[There
are]{.mark} multiple **Malthusian and [Orientalist resonances]{.mark}**
here]{.underline}, of course, [and these have long been [mirrored
in]{.mark} the **abstracted and [reductive]{.mark} geographical
[writing]{.mark}** so common to Strategic Studies and defense policy
institutes more generally]{.underline} (cf Morrissey et al, 2009). In
the foreword to Stability Operations, Lieutenant General William
Caldwell outlined the global security challenge facing the United States
using the familiar register of the 'long war' against radical Islam: "we
have been engaged in epic struggle unlike any other in our history" and
face "challenges of an uncertain future" in "a persistent conflict" (US
Department of the Army, 2008b, page C2). A few months earlier, General
William Wallace in his foreword to Operations began with a similar
geopolitical formulation, priming once again the notions of "persistent
conflict" and "protracted confrontation" (US Department of the Army,
2008a, page C2). With the 'instability register' successfully mobilized,
Wallace then heralds the doctrinal shift to full spectrum operations as
"a revolutionary departure" and a commitment to a new operational
concept where "commanders employ offensive, defensive, and stability or
civil support operations simultaneously" (US Department of the Army,
2008a, page C2). [[The]{.mark} **discursive [binary]{.mark}** [of
**identifying instability** and promising]{.mark} anew its
[securitization is an **old tactic of
interventionism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, of course. [The US armed forces
overseas have long been tasked with a remit of **military--economic
securitization**]{.underline}, particularly in the Middle East via US
Central Command (CENTCOM). I have previously outlined [the development
of CENTCOM's neoliberal interventionary mission]{.underline} since the
early 1980s and shown how it [reveals a **conjoined history** of
military and economic securitization]{.underline}, involving practices
of deterrence, policing, and regulation (Morrissey, 2011a; cf Palmer,
1992). I consider below some of the most recent imaginings of the
deployment of the US military in this role globally and reflect on where
stability operations are being envisaged therein.

4 Military and economic stability operations

Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century Defense
is the Obama administration's latest expression of US global strategic
vision. It proclaims that in the aftermath of "large-scale, prolonged
stability operations" in Iraq and Afghanistan, the United States will
increasingly "emphasize non-military means and military-to-military
cooperation to address instability" (US Department of Defense, 2012,
page 6). Securing 'instability', moreover, involves protecting US
economic and security interests, orienting a focused geographic mission
on what CENTCOM calls the 'Central Region', and championing [[a
neoliberal global]{.mark} economic [order]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[**[necessitates securitization]{.mark}** of military
force]{.underline}: ""U.S. economic and security interests are
inextricably linked to developments in the arc extending from the
Western Pacific and East Asia into the Indian Ocean region and South
Asia ... . The maintenance of peace, stability, the free flow of
commerce, and of U.S. influence in this dynamic region will depend in
part on an underlying balance of military capability and presence. ...
The United States will continue to make the necessary investments to
ensure that we maintain regional access and the ability to operate
freely in ... a rules-based international order that ensures underlying
stability" (US Department of Defense, 2012, page 2).

Securitizing instability 617

The US role, furthermore, in policing the "global commons" and enabling
"economic growth and commerce" is also laid out:

""\[The US\] will seek to protect freedom of access throughout the
global commons--- those areas beyond national jurisdiction that
constitute the vital connective tissue of the international system" (US
Department of Defense, 2012, page 3).

[A broader commitment to commerce and its securitization is evident
elsewhere too]{.underline}. An additional 2012 national security
document, National Strategy for Global Supply Chain Security, published
by the White House, is a case in point. The document is shot through
with an unambiguous binding of 'economy' and 'security', and a rejection
of "the false choice between security and efficiency" (The White House,
2012, page 2; cf Harcourt, 2012). Extensively registered too are
universalist calls for partnerships "with state, local, and tribal
governments, the private sector, and the international community"---to
realize "our shared goal of building a new framework to strengthen and
protect this vital \[global economic\] system" (The White House, 2012,
page C3). And [once again we get a **firm intermeshing of military and
economic security logics**]{.underline}:

""while the security of our citizens and our nation is the paramount
concern, we must work to promote America's future economic growth and
international competitiveness by remaining open for businesses to the
world" (The White House, 2012, page 6).

The 'security' and 'economic' interests equation is not new, of course,
and dates back to at least the immediate post-WW2 era and the signing of
the Roosevelt--Aziz pact, which I have documented elsewhere (Morrissey,
2009). The conjoined military--economic national security discourse
became solidified in the aftermath of a series of crises threatening the
free flow of oil in the 1970s and culminated in the emergence of the
'Rapid Deployment Force' concept in late 1979. Subsequent to the
enunciation of the Carter doctrine in January 1980, a new responsibility
was tasked to the US military in protecting US interests in the Persian
Gulf region. The Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force was established in
March 1980 and in 1983 became a unified command, CENTCOM. CENTCOM's
annual posture statements (delivered by the command's head each year to
the Senate Armed Services Committee) have consistently presented a
focused military--economic securitization strategy ever since. Its
current envisioning of its role in the Middle East by Commander General
James Mattis underlines once again what will centrally "keep U.S.
attention anchored in this region": "oil and energy resources that fuel
the global economy" (US Central Command, 2013). A notable departure in
Mattis's presentation to the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2013,
however, was his signaling of the fiscal restraints within which the DoD
are operating and his acknowledging of a broader interagency approach to
US interventionism overseas: ""U.S. Central Command's approach---working
in tandem with the State Department and other agencies through a whole
of government approach---is to protect our interests using fewer
military resources in an era of fiscal restraint and political change"
(US Central Command, 2013).

CENTCOM's primary role in militarily policing and protecting the 'global
economy' remains, however, and signaling a 'whole of government'
approach to that end reads as merely an additional rhetorical
justification for a universalist neoliberal mission. CENTCOM has not
deviated from its long-established remit of 'shaping' the political
economy of its 'area of responsibility', the energy-rich region of the
Persian Gulf and Central Asia---enabled by the most extensive overseas
basing structure of any nation in history (Morrissey, 2011b). From its
inception, CENTCOM has consistently relied upon a common-sense
understanding of the use of Western interventionary force to guard
against threat and political economic instability. In what is now a
proliferated discourse of military--economic securitization, CENTCOM's
presence in the Middle East, including of course its interventionary
violence, assumes both a regulative and a generative function in the
international economic system (Morrissey, 2011a). For this key notion of
'generative' interventionism, stability operations can, of course, be
usefully incorporated. The JAGC, for instance, advises its judge
advocates in the field that stability operations primarily involve
establishing "essential services, economic and infrastructure
development, and governance" (US Department of the Army, 2013, page
5-4). As I have outlined elsewhere, [[the]{.mark} contemporary US

Global Leadership, US President Barack Obama invokes a common temporal
and geopolitical register synonymous with the US military at this point:
the notion of an 'uncertain future' and the US military's necessary role
in securing it. Obama speaks of a "moment of transition" in which the US
is endeavoring to "end today's war", "reshape \[the\] Armed Forces", and
ensure that they are "agile, flexible, and ready for the full range of
contingencies" (US Department of Defense, 2012, page iii).(9) And
despite the Budget Control Act of 2011, Obama is adamant in outlining
America's prioritized and enduring national security interests, which
are explicitly tied to economic interests:

""We seek the security of our Nation, allies and partners. We seek the
prosperity that flows from an open and free international economic
system" (US Department of Defense, 2012, page iii).

[Perhaps **more attention needs to be paid to [the historic matrix for
our current thinking of catastrophe]{.mark}**, along with its limits and
effects, [in]{.mark} the [**Cold War strategic planning** that
contemplated **initiating and surviving military and environmental
catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the conception of catastrophe
that emerged in U.S. strategic discussions of the 1950s and early 1960s,
[the risk or **possibility** of **nuclear catastrophe** was
**secondary** to the **importance of surviving it**. A major element in
the proposition that catastrophe was survivable was the immunizing of
civil populations against its threat; [the **strategic assumption** that
**catastrophe** was in principle **survivable** became a **cultural and
political fact** that both **encouraged**]{.mark} the [**dissemination
of the idea of catastrophe** while **immunizing us against its
horror**]{.mark} through the conviction that it was **survivable**. [The
**dangerous legacy**]{.mark} of this paradigm [is evident in]{.mark} the
**[sluggish response]{.mark} of state and international actors [to the
threat posed by systemic planetary instability to the survival of human
life]{.mark}** on this planet]{.underline}.

Most genealogies of geological catastrophe begin in eighteenth- and
earlynineteenth-century debates between catastrophic and continuist
approaches to the fossil and stratigraphic records---such as Charles
Lyell's arguments against Georges Cuvier in the early nineteenth
century. However, it is important not to underestimate the importance of
the more recent and uncanny mobilization of the idea of survivable
catastrophe as an organizing principle of the strategic doctrine of
total war during the Cold War. What Eisenhower criticized as the
"military-industrial complex," or the immense investment in military
research and development central to U.S. strategy in the Cold War, was
organized not only around the concept of catastrophe---especially how to
inflict it upon adversaries---but also around how to survive
catastrophe. It was not just confined to the closed doors and secret
meetings of strategic debate but became a cultural fact whose legacy
continues, even in ways that seem remote from its military sources.

[Jacob Hamblin has traced]{.underline} some aspects of [this genealogy
in]{.underline} his challenging [Arming Mother Nature: The Birth of
Catastrophic Environmentalism]{.underline}. Hamblin makes a powerful
contribution to an emergent counter-history of the environmentalist
movement by tracing the notion of environmental catastrophe to the
strategic planning for environmental war. [He shows that the
[**discourses** of **world war** and **environmental catastrophe** are
**closely related**]{.mark}: "The language of the Cold War's global
crisis and that of environmental crisis are strikingly
similar]{.underline}. That left room for alternative views that postwar
affluence, dissatisfaction with pollution and a new understanding of
environmental hazards were the most important factors."17 In the
emergent counter-history of environmentalism, [the global theater of the
Cold War and the destructive effects of nuclear weapons, along with
civil/military initiatives dedicated to survival, [led to]{.mark} the
elaboration of [a **planetary consciousness**]{.mark} but one **[firmly
rooted in a strategy of survivable catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Hamblin examines a wide range of military discussions dedicated to
combining atomic bombs with natural forces, to extending the
possibilities of biological warfare, to gathering information and data
about the coming planetary battlefield, and to achieving the satellite
mapping of the planet. With respect to the last initiative, his analysis
of [[the drive to gather **planetary data**]{.underline}]{.mark} during
the International Geophysical Year in 1957 offers invaluable background
to the circumstances that subsequently [[led **not only** to]{.mark} the
**[measurement of]{.mark} global [carbon dioxide]{.mark} levels** [but
**also** to **NATO's discussions of
environmental**]{.mark}]{.underline}/ecological warfare in the early
1960s Von Kármán Committee. He shows how [**[catastrophe]{.mark}**,
[**both** how to **inflict** and how to **survive** it]{.mark}, is at
the center of all these discussions: "[**Environmental cataclysms**
could become **part of the alliance's arsenal**]{.mark}]{.underline},
with the help of a well-placed nuclear explosion."18 Hamblin shows how
this strategic attention to environmental war passed over---often
through the same scientists---into a civil environmental critique of
planetary degradation and became part of the intellectual legacy of
strategic environmental warfare. [The **measurements** and **data**
collected under the aegis of a **willed global conflict** between human
adversaries using the weapon of **artificially stimulated environmental
catastrophe**]{.underline}19 [came to serve the emergent idea of an
**unintended global environmental catastrophe**]{.underline}---[induced
by **human actions**]{.underline}, [suffered by the
**planet**]{.underline}, [but also in principle
**survivable**]{.underline}. [The **data collection**]{.underline}, [the
**programs** for processing it]{.underline}, [and the **interpretative
protocols** for making sense of it all emerged from this matrix of
**survivable catastrophe**]{.underline}.

Hamblin's account of the role of survivable catastrophe in environmental
discourse may be supplemented with two further examples, one from the
RAND Corporation20---the research and development think tank associated
with the U.S. Air Force and dedicated, at the height of the Cold War, to
theorizing nuclear deterrence and first-strike capability---and the
other from NASA's earth systems theory, which became the condition of
possibility for conceptualizing the Anthropocene. Both cases offer
examples of survivable **[[catastrophist
discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}** at work and give a sense of how
**[[deeply]{.underline}]{.mark}** they [**[inform contemporary]{.mark}
attitudes** toward the future]{.underline}, [especially the **blithe
[inaction in the face of acknowledged
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Necessary Violence

Having established that [the principal task set for biopolitical
practitioners is to sort and adjudicate between the
species]{.underline}, modern societies reveal a distinct biopolitical
aporia (an irresolvable political dilemma) in the sense that making life
live -- [selecting out those ways of life that are fittest by
design]{.underline} -- inevitably writes into that very script those
lives that are retarded, backward, degenerate, wasteful and ultimately
dangerous to the social order (Bauman, 1991). [Racism]{.underline} thus
[appears here]{.underline} to be a thoroughly modern phenomenon (Deleuze
& Guattari, 2002). [This takes us to the heart of our concern with
biopolitical rationalities. When '**life itself' becomes the principal
referent** for political struggles, power necessarily concerns itself
with those **biological threats to human existence**]{.underline}
(Palladino, 2008). That is to say, [since life becomes the author of its
own (un)making, the biopolitical assay of life **necessarily portrays a
commitment to the supremacy of certain species types**: 'a race that is
portrayed as the **one true race**, the race that holds power and is
entitled to define the norm, and against those who deviate from that
norm, **against those who pose a threat to the biological
heritage'**]{.underline} (Foucault, 2003: 61). Evidently, what is at
stake here is no mere sovereign affair. Epiphenomenal tensions aside,
[racial problems occupy a **'permanent presence' within the political
order**]{.underline} (Foucault, 2003: 62). [Biopolitically
speaking]{.underline}, then, [since it is precisely through the
**internalization of threat**]{.underline} -- the constitution of the
threat that is now from the dangerous 'Others' that exist within --
[that societies reproduce]{.underline} at the level of life [the
ontological commitment to secure the subject]{.underline}, since
**[everybody is now possibly dangerous and nobody can be exempt, for
political modernity]{.underline}** to function one always has to be
capable of killing in order to go on living:

> [Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign]{.underline} who
> must be defended; [**they are waged on behalf of the existence of
> everyone**; entire populations are mobilized]{.underline} for the
> purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity;
> massacres have become vital. . . . The principle underlying the
> tactics of battle -- that [one has to become capable of killing in
> order to go on living]{.underline} -- has become the principle that
> defines the strategy of states (Foucault, 1990: 137).

[When Foucault refers to 'killing', he is not simply referring to the
vicious act of taking another life]{.underline}: 'When I say "killing",
I obviously do not mean simply murder as such, [but also every form of
indirect murder: the fact of exposing someone to death, increasing the
risk of death]{.underline} for some people, [or, quite simply, political
death]{.underline}, expulsion, rejection and so on' (Foucault, 2003:
256). Racism makes this process of elimination possible, for it is only
through the discourse and practice of racial (dis)qualification that one
is capable of introducing 'a break in the domain of life that is under
power's control: the break between what must live and what must die'
(Foucault, 2003: 255). While killing does not need to be physically
murderous, that is not to suggest that we should lose sight of the very
real forms of political violence that do take place in the name of
species improvement. As Deleuze (1999: 76) duly noted, [when notions of
security are invoked in order to **preserve the destiny of a species**,
when the defence of society gives sanction to very real acts of violence
that are justified in terms of **species necessity**]{.underline}, that
is when the capacity to legitimate murderous political actions in all
our names and for all our sakes becomes altogether more rational,
calculated, utilitarian, hence altogether more frightening:

> When a diagram of power abandons the model of sovereignty in favour of
> a disciplinary model, when it becomes the 'bio-power' or
> 'bio-politics' of populations, controlling and administering life, it
> is indeed [life]{.underline} that [emerges as the new **object of
> power**]{.underline}. At that point [law]{.underline} increasingly
> renounces that symbol of sovereign privilege, the right to put someone
> to death, but [allows itself to produce all the more hecatombs and
> **genocides**]{.underline}: not by returning to the old law of
> killing, but on the contrary [in the name of race, precious space,
> conditions of life and the survival of a population that believes
> itself to be better than its enemy, which it now treats]{.underline}
> not as the juridical enemy of the old sovereign but [as a]{.underline}
> toxic or infectious agent, a sort of '**[biological
> danger']{.underline}**.

### L -- Heg Transition / LIO

#### Securitizing "great power transition" is [self-defeating]{.underline} -- reflects [paranoia, NOT reality]{.underline} -- that institutionalizes [preemptive confrontation]{.underline}, [accelerating counterbalancing]{.underline}, violent [interventionism]{.underline}, and conflict [escalation]{.underline}

**[Securitisation]{.underline}** theory thus [focuses on a particular
mode of political agency characterised by a **rhetoric of exception**,
which uses presumably **existential threats** as a trigger to set off
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline}. In terms of its practical
consequences, securitisation performatively engenders a state of
emergency. Working against the procedures of normal political
communication revolving around alternative courses of action,
[securitisation **reduces** the possibility of **choice** to an
**either--or** level, that is, whether we **act or not**]{.underline}.
Securitisation dynamics can lead to the authorisation of extraordinary
measures that otherwise could not have been used. Desecuritisation, by
contrast, refers to the gradual process of 'rhetorical disarmament',
which aims at the withdrawal of a particular issue off the security
agenda and replaces the logic of exception, immediate necessity and
emergency with the routinised patterns of normal politics (e.g.,
Williams 1998; Aradau 2004; Huysmans 2006). Such an understanding of
securitisation and desecuritisation as processes focuses our attention
on the practical consequences of 'speaking security'. Hence, as Ole
Wæver (1995: 54--57) has pointed out, declaring something as an issue of
security is an inherently political act with de-politicising
consequences attaching priority to the problem at hand and narrowing the
range of legitimate alternatives.

[Historically, the formation of **Western order** has typically been
**described as** such **a process of desecuritisation**, in which a
'culture of **legal formalism**']{.underline} (Koskenniemi 2001:
494--509) [has gradually replaced old-style power politics
which]{.underline}, in turn, [could be described as a network of
interconnected securitisations]{.underline}. Focusing, in particular, on
processes of securitisation and desecuritisation seems warranted as 'the
West' is increasingly portrayed as a threatened, endangered space.
Looking at the West from a security perspective that is informed by the
Copenhagen School by no means confines 'the West' to the realm of
security policy. It simply provides an angle that allows us to trace a
particular kind of transformation of Western order as a political space
by observing how different issues are being securitised or
desecuritised, that is, moved on and off the security agenda. The larger
theoretical point here is that securitisation processes are exemplary
vehicles for the transformation of order triggered through the
institutional consequences of performative acts. Securitisation,
therefore, can be regarded as an ordering mechanism that takes 'politics
beyond the established rules of the game and frames the issue either as
a special kind of politics or as above politics' (Buzan et al. 1998:
23).Footnote4

In Regions and Powers, Buzan and Wæver (2003) jointly address the
question of regional security and the ordering effects of securitisation
dynamics at a regional level. Surprisingly, they take entities like
'North America', 'Asia', or 'Europe' as unproblematic givens rather than
as categories of political struggle. They clearly state that 'the
existence of an RSC (regional security complex) is not in terms of the
discursive 'construction of regions' (ibid.: 48). While, by definitional
fiat, Buzan and Wæver split the US and Europe into two different
security complexes, the long and powerful history of 'the West' stands
in sharp contrast to such a distinction, especially if we consider its
prominence as a referent object in post-9/11 securitisation dynamics,
where an immediate sense of danger was shared in both the US and Europe
precisely because the attacks were targeting 'the West' at large. Hence,
for the purpose of our project, it is important to focus precisely on
the discursive construction of political spaces and imaginative
geographies in order to understand how a Western order is
re-constituted.

So far, we have argued that securitisation triggers potentially
far-reaching institutional consequences, which may add up to a state of
emergency where the conduct of public life is subordinated to a defence
against existential threats. Institutional consequences are thus the
result of performative acts that can be understood as a form of
'creative action': social action that aims at solving problems where
routinised patterns of interpretation no longer seem to fit (Joas 1996).
In particular, framing an issue in security terms entails the pressure
to accelerate the decision-making process so that securitising moves
might add to the impression that normal procedures have become
inappropriate. In contrast to standard conceptions of order where
conflicts pose a dramatic challenge to some taken-for-granted normative
foundations, we conceive of order as an historically contingent
arrangement of institutional consequences (Wendt 1992, 1999; Herborth
2004). Here the conceptual counterpoint to order is not 'anarchy',
'chaos', 'instability', or 'institutional breakdown', whereby order is
still marked as the normatively preferable (and superior) concept
(Ashley 1988). In our understanding, order is conceptually related first
and foremost to agency in such a way that it is essentially made up of
different institutions resulting from the creativity of social
transactions. What appears to us as a relatively stable institution or a
fixed order is thus nothing but a sedimentation of routinised patterns
of signification (Dewey 1938/1991: 105--22). To the extent that such
processes of signification refer to 'contentious politics' (Tilly and
Tarrow 2007) we can encounter manifold forms of contestation and crisis
as well as cooperation among and within Western societies that may sum
up to processes of community formation. Thus, conceptualising
institutional consequences as the result of creative action enables us
to reconsider the transformation of Western order without pre-judging
whether its normative foundation is eroding or lasting. Disparate
accounts of the nature of transatlantic relations notwithstanding, the
collective wisdom of available scholarship nevertheless suggests good
reasons to assume that there may indeed be something specific to such
'Western' forms of conflict and cooperation. Yet, what precisely those
are remains open to empirical investigation.

Securitising 'The West': Three dimensions

Having emphasised, at a general theoretical level, that 'the future of
the West' hinges on contingent processes of signification rather than
transhistorical macro-dynamics, we have committed ourselves to tracing
particular instances of signification instead of partaking in
pundit-like speculations as to where 'the West' may go, get stuck, or
eventually end up. Rather we intend to reconstruct transformations of
'Western order' by focusing on the actual meanings actors attach to 'the
West'. Given limitations of space, we can only summarise the main
results of our more in-depth reconstruction of transformations of
Western order. In selecting and delimiting research areas we have been
guided by our judgment as to what is usually represented as the
characteristic and defining sets of interaction in the literature on
transatlantic relations and 'Western order'. [Most scholars]{.underline}
in the field [would contend that in order to assess current dynamics of
conflict and cooperation in transatlantic relations and in order to
appraise the status of 'the West' as a security community, one would
have to address at least three substantive issues]{.underline}.

[First]{.underline}, one would have to investigate the impact of
[[the]{.mark} current **['power transition']{.mark} with Asia**
gradually displacing Europe and North America as the centre of world
politics]{.underline}. Objectors of the 'unipolarity' thesis had first
insinuated that this was about to happen (Layne 1993; Waltz 1993;
Mearsheimer 2001: 396--402; Pape 2005). [More recently, the
**[debate]{.mark}** has evolved into the more explicit question [of what
the '**rise**' of]{.mark} states such as [**China** and
**Russia**]{.mark} would [mean for]{.mark} the future of 'the West' and
whether '[the **l**]{.mark}**iberal [i]{.mark}nternational
[o]{.mark}rder**' [could 'survive']{.mark} when faced with
'**authoritarian capitalism**' as an **alternative model** to **liberal
democracy**]{.underline} (e.g., Gat 2007; Kagan 2008; Ikenberry 2008;
Deudney and Ikenberry 2009; Kupchan 2012). Accordingly, the first
research area focuses on the macro-dimension of Western self-conceptions
vis-à-vis China and Russia and boundary-creating processes that go along
with them.

The [second]{.underline} issue commonly regarded as indispensable for
assessing the present condition of transatlantic relations [is the
contested status of **NATO**]{.underline}. Whether it is regarded as an
interstate alliance that has lost its purpose (Waltz 2000: 18--27), [as
a **security community** of **liberal democracies**]{.underline}
(Risse-Kappen 1996) or else as an adaptable security management
institution (Wallander 2000), each [conceptualisation involves a
diagnosis on the main factors of transatlantic cooperation
and]{.underline}, quite often, [a diagnosis of the presumable fate of
'the West']{.underline} (cf. Hellmann 2008; Franke 2010: 19--53). The
tendency to link NATO\'s likely or unlikely survival with the 'future of
the West' more recently manifested in the debates about the consequences
of the transatlantic conflict over the war against Iraq and over the
prospects in Afghanistan (e.g., Asmus 2003; Cox 2005; Pouliot 2006;
Anderson et al. 2008). As NATO still figures prominently as the key
transatlantic security institution, the second research area will
reconsider institutional dynamics and discursive shifts relating to the
alliance.

The [third]{.underline} prominent topic in scholarly debates about 'the
West' [concerns the responses to global terrorism after
9/11]{.underline}. Frequently interpreted as a direct assault on 'the
West' and its 'way of life', [the terrorist attacks in New York,
Washington, London, and Madrid have been answered in a way that arguably
undermines the very normative foundations they are designed to
protect]{.underline}. Scholars and journalists have pointed out that the
legislative, military, and penal measures used in the 'war on terror'
directly suspend the civil rights and contradict the democratic ideals
'the West' claims for itself (Hersh 2004; Rejali 2007; Prantl 2008;
Mayer 2008). The effects of transatlantic responses to global terrorism
demarcate a field in which the traditional borders between domestic and
foreign policy problems begin to blur. The third research area therefore
refers to internal struggles in which normative requirements derived
from a particular Western self-image are confronted with the factual or
putative imperatives of preventing further terrorist attacks.

To sum up, focusing on great power rivalry with China and Russia, the
re-constitution of NATO as the primary transatlantic security
institution, and the responses to global terrorism within a 'Western
order' accesses the main sites of ongoing scholarly discussion about
transatlantic relations and 'the West'. From the point of view of a
reconstructive logic of enquiry, the selection of more specific cases
and texts within each research area was guided by internal standards as
it is recommended, for instance, by the methodology of grounded theory
(Strauss and Corbin 1998). As the method ought to fit the subject matter
rather than vice-versa, these choices need to be 'field-specific' and
continually improved and adjusted according to field-specific
experiences (ibid.; Strübing 2004). [What we found [is **not** a single
**overarching macro-dynamic**]{.mark} under which a multitude of
individual observations could be subsumed, [but rather]{.mark}
different, [**field-specific responses** to]{.mark} an open-ended
[**tension** between two **conflicting**]{.mark} principles (or
**[articulations]{.mark}**) [of a **'Western order'**]{.mark}, namely,
**self-assertion** and **self-restraint**. In all three research areas
we reconstructed an **ongoing tension** between [the **self-assertive**
dynamics of a '**securitised West**' and a **legalist culture of
formalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Koskenniemi 2001) [[that
imposes]{.mark} explicit **[limit]{.mark}ation[s]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
[the use of violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The 'West' vis-à-vis 'Authoritarian Great Powers'

[[Many]{.mark} books and articles [have]{.mark} recently [diagnosed
a]{.mark}n ongoing [**global transition of power** to the **detriment of
'the West'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It has become common practice to
[address]{.mark} countries such as **Brazil**, **Russia**, **India**,
and **China** as [**'rising powers'** and]{.mark} to **[assume]{.mark}**
that they [will **translate**]{.mark} their **[economic growth]{.mark}**
rates [into ever-greater **political influence**]{.mark} on the global
stage]{.underline}.Footnote5 The impact of the financial crisis since
2008 and the ensuing enlargement of the traditional G7/8 club into the
G20 lent further credibility to this belief. [While the ascendency of
**democratic countries** such as **Brazil** and **India** is largely
regarded as **unproblematic**, the alleged 'return of **authoritarian
great powers**' is often presented as a potential **challenge** to the
**'Western liberal order'**]{.underline} (e.g., Gat 2007). [A dominant
discourse in Europe and North America **[subsumes China and
Russia]{.mark}** under the category of 'authoritarian great powers' and
pits them against 'the West' [in a scenario of]{.mark} upcoming **[great
power competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[This story with its audacious simplifications and its bold predictions
has been told many times in different variations]{.underline}, most
prominently by Robert Kagan. In his book The Return of History and the
End of Dreams, he warns against an anti-Western conspiracy, [construing
**China\'s and Russia\'s 'rise'** as an omen for an emerging
'association of autocrats' who are unfavourably disposed towards
'liberalism' and 'democracy']{.underline}. [[**Assuming**
**both**]{.mark} their [**hostile intentions** and]{.mark} their
**[successful cooperation]{.mark}** allows]{.underline} him [to [draw a
**worst-case scenario** in which the]{.mark} shape of the 'future
[**international order**' **hinges upon**]{.mark} the determination of
'[the **world\'s democracies**' to]{.mark} 'protect their interests and
**[defend their principles]{.mark}** in a world in which these are once
again powerfully challenged']{.underline} (Kagan 2008: 53--59, 105, 97).
[To be sure, [**prophecies of imminent decline** have permeated the
**discourse of 'the West'** **from the**]{.mark} **very
[beginning]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jackson 2010). [However, in contrast
to a pessimistic]{.underline} Spenglerian [view of history, contemporary
warnings usually do not present Western demise as an inevitable fact.
They rather [paint **worst-case scenarios** that **legitimise**]{.mark}
**different [strategies to maintain the s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In order to ascertain to what extent public--political rhetoric is
infused by this discourse, we analysed two concrete transatlantic
struggles over the right strategy to deal with China and Russia, namely,
the controversy about the European weapons embargo on China and the
debate about Russia\'s eventual membership in NATO. Both instances
featured a quite similar structure of conflict in dealing with
'authoritarian great powers'. They also revealed a strong sense of
superiority and an alert defence preparedness to be central for
processes of transatlantic community formation.

Attempts of the Chinese and Russian governments to improve security
relations with Europe and North America encountered a heterogeneous and
often discordant group of states. When individual governments proposed
to cooperate with China and Russia on the basis of national interests,
others immediately reminded them that those countries did not share
basic values and therefore did not qualify as viable partners. At the
centre of the controversy over the European Union (EU) weapons embargo
on China between 2003 and 2005 stood the question of whether a more
powerful China should be approached as an equal partner, especially
whether it could be trusted in the sensitive area of military
cooperation. The French and the German government, as well as officials
of the EU Commission, opted for great power cooperation with China and
seemed determined to go through with this plan despite stern US
objections. In the case of Russia\'s membership in NATO, policymakers in
Great Britain, Germany, and the US showed themselves open minded towards
Putin\'s 2001 proposal to put the relationship between NATO and Russia
on a new basis. In the face of terrorist threats, a fundamental
'realignment' between Europe, America, and Russia seemed possible.

Both the proponents of lifting the arms embargo on China and the
advocates of granting Russia equal participation in NATO decision making
were emphatically reminded by their partner states and their national
parliaments that they were obliged to defend identity-establishing
values that could not be sold out or be disregarded. Although security
concerns were an important element in some of these objections,
transatlantic political elites could not agree on whether these
countries posed an actual 'threat'. They did, however, ultimately reach
a consensus that security cooperation with China and Russia was only
acceptable as far as they would democratise and respect human rights.
Abstract references to these values enabled a common transatlantic
position.

The analysis of these two cases demonstrates that [[there are]{.mark}
indeed [attempts]{.mark} by European and North American governments [to
**cooperate with China and Russia**]{.mark} on the basis of geostrategic
calculations. [However]{.mark}, as soon as officials undertake serious
steps in this direction, they [are **disciplined by a vague commitment
to**]{.mark} **a [common]{.mark} foundation of
[values]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Thus, the moral distinctiveness that
allegedly is wedded to being a part of 'the West' has to be reiterated
time and again]{.underline}. Interestingly, [this particular talk only
makes sense if there is a foil, in this case 'authoritarian great
powers']{.underline}. In both of the analysed transatlantic conflicts,
[articulations re-established and validated a normative boundary
separating China and Russia as 'authoritarian great powers' from the
liberal democracies of 'the West']{.underline}. Constructing such a
fundamental difference proves to be essential for the fabrication of a
transatlantic sense of community. In both debates, [European and North
American elites claimed to speak on behalf of a 'community of values'
that was in a position to define normative standards of universal
validity and to judge whether other countries conformed to these
standards]{.underline}. The precondition thus seemed to be an unspoken
and unquestioned consensus on two interrelated beliefs: [first, that is
was clear how]{.underline} human rights and [**democracy** had to be
understood and, second, that North Americans and Europeans carried a
special responsibility for their worldwide dissemination and
implementation]{.underline}.

In a nutshell, [the re-constitution of a transatlantic community is
based on an idealisation of distinct value commitments and the
consequent normative demarcation from authoritarian states such as China
and Russia. What is often described in static terms as the
'**cohesion**' of transatlantic relations proves to be a **process of
self-affirmation** that [**relies on the construction of fundamental
differences** and the **moral de-legitimation of the
'non-West'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This finding confirms postcolonial
and poststructuralist analyses of how Eurocentric patterns of thought
shape the relations between 'the West' and its Other(s). In this sense,
the attitudes and patterns of interpretation at work in processes of
'Western' community formation are just one further episode to deal in a
self-righteous way with differences in world politics. In the relations
towards China and Russia, however, an important aspect is added to the
equation. Both are regarded as powerful countries, a fact that
apparently makes it more delicate when they fail to adopt liberal
democracy as the superior model of political rule. [The [**refusal**
by]{.mark} the **[Chine]{.mark}se [and Russia]{.mark}n** governments [to
acknowledge such **universalist claims** makes them **appear**
as]{.mark} incalculable or even **[hostile
opponents]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[**China** apparently is about to **surpass liberal countries in
economic development** without the anticipated democratic reforms taking
place]{.underline}. [**Russia** in turn is attributed with the potential
to **provoke** Eastern European countries **militarily** or
**blackmail** them **economically**]{.underline}. When the prospects for
a transformation of these countries seem to diminish, the
self-confidence of North American and European elites easily turned into
the fear that precious normative achievements may be in danger and must
be defended against possible assaults. Thus, [when it comes to China and
Russia, the already present [sense of **superiority** combines
with]{.mark} diffuse [fears of]{.mark} a **[shrinking material
power]{.mark}** basis for projecting allegedly universal norms and
institutions]{.underline}. [As a result, [a **morally superior** but
**materially declining** **'West'** is called upon to **safeguard the
l**]{.mark}**iberal [i]{.mark}nternational [o]{.mark}rder** before it
falls prey to 'rising' authoritarian great powers]{.underline}. This is
the case-specific [pull towards]{.underline} the
**[securitisation]{.underline}** pole. [The **normative demarcation**
vis-à-vis unpredictable and **morally questionable authoritarian great
powers** [engender a **latent confrontational posture**]{.mark} against
these states. **As long** as they have **not transformed into liberal
democracies**, their moves tend to be observed with **fearful
scepticism**]{.underline}.

In sum, a strong sense of superiority, which is semantically linked to
the notion of 'the West', provides the basis for diffuse threat
scenarios in transatlantic discourse on 'authoritarian great powers'.
[The idea that non-Western others might propose acceptable alternatives
to existing rules and institutions is **hard to reconcile** with the
**self-conception** of European and North American elites as
representing **the vanguard of the political and moral development of
humankind**]{.underline}. [This self-conception **predisposes** these
elites to **interpret** those **Chinese and Russian positions, which run
counter to such pretensions** either as '**challenges**' for the
stability of the **'liberal international order'** or even as potential
long-term **security threats to 'the West'** as a community of
values]{.underline}.

NATO\'s strategic discourse and the self-authorisation of 'the West'

While the first research area dealt with representations of
'authoritarian regimes' that are by definition categorised as being
outside of the boundaries of 'the West', this research area focuses on
the transformation of NATO, that is, the military alliance that is
considered to be the institutional core of what we usually call 'the
West' (e.g., Gress 2004; Brzezinski 2009). Obviously, [**transatlantic
[security coop]{.mark}eration** has been [a]{.mark} classical
[theme]{.mark}]{.underline} in IR, [either from a **realist** vantage
point, where NATO is primarily described as a defence alliance
subordinated to national purposes]{.underline} (Waltz 2000: 18), [or
from a **liberal** perspective, [where **NATO** is understood as an
**alliance of democracies**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Risse-Kappen 1995: 4).
[In **both** perspectives, however, the dynamics of **security
cooperation** between North America and Europe **seem unproblematic** as
long as the allies are convinced of their **common interest** or their
**shared values**]{.underline}.

[**NATO**\'s (lasting) ability to voice **in-/securities**]{.underline}
--- [for]{.underline} example a 'Soviet threat', 'terrorism', or **['new
challenges']{.underline}** --- [directs our attention to **[highly
institutionalised]{.mark}** dynamics of [**securitisation**
that]{.mark}]{.underline}, as the subsequent analysis will show,
[[manifest]{.underline}]{.mark} themselves [[as]{.mark} a
[**self-authorisation** of **'the West'**]{.mark} in order [to **defend
its normative foundation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Such a tendency
towards self-authorisation has become visible in different
forms]{.underline} since the North Atlantic alliance was founded in
1949. During the Cold War, [it primarily **enabled** a rather deep
institutionalisation of **military cooperation** with an integrated
command structure including US **nuclear weapons**, as well as common
strategic planning and defence exercises]{.underline}. After the Cold
War, this project was continued but it has certainly changed in form.
[**Out-of-area operations** and the development of a **globally** active
alliance is one of the most visible expressions of such
**self-authorising practices**]{.underline}. These dynamics were central
to re-constitute NATO during critical junctures [and have been
**productive** of a **highly self-confident** Western alliance
today]{.underline} (Jackson 2003; Bially Mattern 2005; Behnke 2013).

The North Atlantic Treaty, signed in April 1949 by representatives of
nine Western European states, Iceland, Canada, and the US, provided the
Western alliance with a legal basis and outlined the key principles of
cooperation, that is, consultation (Article 4) and collective defence
(Article 5). Although the formulation of Article 5 was highly contested
between the US and its European allies, it was perceived as the
cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation (Kaplan 2004: 4). In
contrast to such a legal framing of Western security cooperation, the
preamble of the Treaty invoked an inherently normative rhetoric when it
stated that the parties 'are determined to safeguard the freedom, common
heritage and civilization of their people, founded on the principle of
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law' (The North Atlantic
Treaty 1949). [The construction of unity based on a common culture and
even **'civilisation'** (rather than merely a **[shared threat
perception]{.mark}**) [transferred **military coop**]{.mark}**eration**
and integration **[far beyond an interest-driven
alliance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Klein 1990; Jackson 2003, 2006a).
During these formative years of NATO, one central aim of formulating
'strategic concepts' was to construct a common security interest of the
US and Western European states that was metaphorically framed in terms
of an 'indivisibility of allied security'.Footnote6

Bearing these normative foundations in mind, NATO gradually evolved as a
cultural project that was directed against communism --- which made the
inclusion of an autocratic state such as Portugal possible --- rather
than as a community of democratic states (Klein 1990; Jackson 2003;
Sjursen 2004). [The **invoked narrative** of **shared norms, values**,
and a common heritage provided a sufficiently strong **rationale** for
defending the North Atlantic Area against **any potential
threat**]{.underline}. Moreover, [it also **[legitimised taking whatever
measures were deemed 'necessary']{.mark}** to defend its
members]{.underline}. ['[**Forward defence**' and '**massive
retaliation**']{.mark} turned out to be such legitimate
means]{.underline}. Nevertheless, in many ways the strength of Western
rhetoric was also intended to polish over and counterbalance many of the
underlying political conflicts that persisted throughout NATO\'s
post-war history. As a matter of fact, over the years it had become a
standard formula in political discourse to refer to an alliance in
'crisis' as proof of its uniquely transatlantic vitality. In this sense
[the **invocation** of a normative foundation of **shared 'Western'
values**]{.underline}, heritage [and **civilisation** even against the
background of **internal political dissent** was as much a
**securitising move** as it was an expression of a particular 'Western'
structure of conflict]{.underline}. One could conclude that
[**transatlantic security cooperation** was **only manageable by
invoking such a normative foundation** of shared values, heritage, and
civilisation]{.underline}.

The subsequent strategic concepts DC 6/1 (December 1952), MC 14/2 (May
1957) and the amended strategic guidelines were written with the
intention to both 'convince the USSR that war does not pay' (NATO 1950)
and to reassure the allies that continued and even intensified that
security cooperation was necessary. Changing strategic concepts, most
prominently from 'massive retaliation' to 'flexible response', restored
the reliability of mutual defence because of altered security
circumstances (e.g., Haftendorn 1996; Tuschhoff 1999; Kaplan 2004: 100).
Although the concept of 'flexible response' eventually satisfied all
allies and remained valid until the end of the Cold War, different
interpretations of deterrence and its operational implications persisted
(Daalder 1991: 41; Risse-Kappen 1995: 184--7). Once again a particular
structure of conflict among NATO allies was observable in the sense that
although a 'crisis' occurred, references to the common heritage, shared
norms and values of the 'free world' restored sufficient coherence among
them. In this sense, the decision over West Germany\'s membership in
1955, the Suez Crisis in 1956, the withdrawal of France from the
integrated military command structure in 1966, or NATO\'s double track
decision in 1979 were all incidents of alliance disruption that
nevertheless did not lead to a break-up of the Atlantic alliance. In
these situations strategic concepts turned out to be crucial in
re-establishing coherence and unity by reaffirming the authority of the
alliance and its ability to (re-)act. The strengthening of consultation
mechanisms in the 1950s, the formation of 'Allied Mobile Forces' (AMF)
in the 1960s, or the deployment of additional Pershing II missiles in
the 1980s embodied the institutional consequences of these strategic
re-orientations.

With the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, many commentators expected that
the Atlantic alliance would sooner or later vanish as well. Thus,
NATO\'s post-Cold War strategies of 1991 and 1999 were primarily aimed
at justifying the institutional continuity of the Western alliance
against the new setting of a decreasing Eastern threat (e.g., Ringsmose
and Rynning 2009: 5). At the beginning of the 1990s, 'Europe, whole and
free' (The Alliance\'s New Strategic Concept 1991) became the obvious
new rhetorical commonplace to legitimise a different future for NATO
compared with the fate of the Warsaw Pact. It opened up the possibility
of Eastern enlargement and paved the way for the institutionalisation of
a new relationship with Russia (Wallander 2000; Williams and Neumann
2000; Schimmelfennig 2003; Adler 2008; Pouliot 2008) as well as
initiatives for cooperation in the Mediterranean (Masala 2003).

In the same vein of institutional and geographical expansion, the
'out-of-area' debate in the mid-1990s rearticulated the necessity for a
political and military engagement far beyond alliance territory and
territorial defence.Footnote7 [While the bipolar confrontation of the
Cold War had largely constrained the alliance\'s global military
engagement, 'safeguarding the freedom, common heritage and
**civilisation**' now ascribed a **global mission** to NATO\'s
members]{.underline}. [Instead of supporting a culture of
**self-restraint** and **legal formalism**, the allies even
**intensified** a tendency towards **self-authorisation** in the name of
defending]{.underline} human rights and [the achievements of **'Western
civilisation'**]{.underline}. [**Disregarding U**nited **N**ations'
**formal legal provisions** in the case of **Kosovo**]{.underline}, NATO
itself became a producer of a common law where the protection of human
rights was deemed more important than respecting state sovereignty and
non-intervention. [The specific formation of NATO\'s strategic discourse
made such **'humanitarian interventions'** intelligible as the new
raison d'être]{.underline}. [Public justifications for military
interventions in **Serbia** or **Afghanistan**, for example, cited the
attack on **'Western' values** as a **determining reason** for taking
**military action**]{.underline}. Ultimately, in its statement on
terrorism, the North Atlantic Council said that 'the lives of our
citizens, and their human rights and civil liberties' were threatened by
terrorism and reaffirmed that the allies 'condemn terrorism in all its
forms and manifestations. We, the 19 NATO Allies, are determined to
combat this scourge. Our security requires no less' (NATO
2001).Footnote8

[During the Cold War, such a project of **self-authorisation** was
primarily realised by **institutionalising** an **integrated command**
structure, **coordinated defence planning** and **common
exercises**]{.underline}. [Today, the [**rhetoric** of **unpredictable
risks**]{.mark} and the global war on terrorism [assigns]{.mark} an
almost [**universal authority** to **NATO**]{.mark}, in particular when
'the challenge is **not just** to make our populations **secure**, but
**feel secure**']{.underline} (de Hoop Scheffer 2009, emphasis added).
'Europe' and [the 'transatlantic area' is the endangered subject of
NATO\'s strategic discourse [justifying]{.mark} a durable and
**institutionally dense [military coop]{.mark}eration** of its member
states [and]{.mark} a [**nuclearisation** of]{.mark} its **[defence
strategy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Whenever allies pursued (national)
security policies without consultation, conflicts and crisis within the
alliance ensued. It was **only through NATO** that **'the West'** could
**materialise its power position** through a specific form of
**self-authorisation**]{.underline}. [**NATO**, respectively Western
states, presented **'democracy'**]{.underline}, 'human rights', [the
**'rule of law'**, and **'market economy'** as **normatively
unquestioned** principles they had **already realised**]{.underline}.
[**Others** had **only one choice:** to **comply** or to
**resist**]{.underline}. [The normative attractiveness of 'the
West']{.underline}, thus, also [directs]{.underline} our attention to
[the temptations of [**securitising practices** where]{.mark} a
formalisation of IR through [**law is marginalised** by **unilateral
acts of self-authorisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Western 'War on Terror': Torture and extraordinary rendition

At first sight, NATO\'s self-authorising tendencies and Western claims
to universality might stand in sharp contrast to how 'the West' is
commonly perceived in its more favourable readings. Among the broad
array of Western self-descriptions, allegiance to the rule of law stands
out as a bedrock principle. The difference between the 'West and the
rest' (Hall 1992) can be accounted for in many different ways, yet the
normative quality of a distinctive set of legal--political routines
stands out as the one most commonly in use. Considerations of due
process and the legal writ of habeas corpus are more than derivative
characteristics, they --- rather than military strength or an advanced
form of capitalist organisationFootnote9 --- are held to define Western
societies and states as such.

Unlawful detention, extraordinary rendition, and torture would thus seem
to constitute an obvious and flagrant violation of the normative
infrastructure of 'the West'. Moreover, yet all of this did take place
in the wake of 'Western' responses to the atrocities of 9/11 that are
now by convention referred to as the global 'war on
terrorism'.Footnote10 To the extent that such transgressions were
justified in a language of necessity, we seem to encounter a showcase
example of securitisation. Both the symbolic value of targeting the
Pentagon and the World Trade Center, and the subsequent narratives of
justification issued by Al-Qaeda, signify that this was not an attack
directed against the US as a state, but more broadly an attack on 'the
West' at large. Defending 'the West' and its unique form of life then
might even justify torture --- and paradoxically the defence of the
'West' thus invoked becomes in itself a threat to 'the West' in its own
right, undermining the very principles it set out to protect.Footnote11

Hence, the interesting research question here is not whether torture and
extraordinary rendition constitute instances of securitisation --- they
obviously do. The challenge is rather to reconstruct carefully the ways
in which such securitisation dynamics play out, what institutional
consequences they yield, what patterns of justification they involve,
and how they contribute to transforming the normative infrastructure of
'the West'. What is at stake, then, is a reconstruction of the
legal--political ramifications of torture and extraordinary rendition,
not the question of whether transgressions have taken place and whether
this conforms to antecedent expectations of securitisation theory. We
know that democracies do torture. As Darius Rejali (2007) has shown in
great detail, democracies have not abolished torture but rather made it
invisible by inventing 'stealth techniques', which leave no trace.
Interrogation techniques such as waterboarding are thus, in an
irritating way, specifically democratic forms of torture. They respond
to the legal and public constraints imposed on such practices by norms
against torture by removing them from the public eye. In fact, this
pattern holds for all of the 'techniques' discussed in the notorious
torture memosFootnote12 --- dietary manipulation, nudity, the attention
grasp, walling, the facial hold, the facial slap or insult slap, cramped
confinement, wall stranding, stress position, water dousing, sleep
deprivation of more than 48 hours, and the waterboard. The very term
applied to such measures, 'enhanced interrogation techniques', testifies
to a specific trait of what Rejali calls 'clean torture'. None of them
leaves a visible mark, none of them seems as outrageously brutal as
medieval forms of torture, and thus they provide a comfortable degree of
deniability to those in authority.

Hence, it is all the more important to focus on how specific
'techniques' have been administered and how this has been justified. 'In
the study of torture', Rejali (2007: 63) rightly observes, 'hell is in
the details'. One of the detailed questions raised in the torture memos
concerns the 'Combined Use of Certain Techniques'. Having stipulated
that each of the single 'techniques' listed above does not constitute a
violation of the anti-torture statute, the 'Memorandum for John A.
Rizzo, Senior Deputy General Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency. Re:
Application of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2340-2340A to the Combined Use of Certain
Techniques in the Interrogation of High Value Al-Qaeda Detainees\'
discusses the question of how things may change when several of these
techniques are used in combination. If sleep deprivation of more than 48
hours is not considered to be legally problematic, then how about sleep
deprivation in combination with cramped confinement, dietary
manipulation, and repeated insult slaps? The way in which the question
is posed in the torture memos presupposes that this is all about
navigating a legal grey zone, where an imaginary torture threshold must
not be crossed in order to avoid legal repercussions. Within the
rationality of the torture memos it is very possible that any particular
combination of techniques does not constitute torture in a legal sense.
It is also very possible that any particular combination of techniques
does constitute torture in a legal sense. It all becomes a question of
dosage. Here the memos are being unspecific in a very specific way. What
we can observe is an instance of intra-institutional buck-passing, which
exempts both the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Department
of Justice from being charged with explicitly advocating or conducting
torture. From the point of view of the CIA, they just did what was
explicitly authorised by the Department of Justice; from the point of
view of the Department of Justice, ultimately crossing the torture
threshold would have to take place in specific instances of
interrogation and thus under the auspices of the CIA. A middle ground is
achieved when the memo calls for 'trained interrogators'. 'Trained
interrogators' are individuals capable of understanding what precise
dosage and combination of such 'techniques' can be administered in order
to remain on the safe side of legality. Hence, from the point of view of
both the CIA and the Department of Justice, transgressions can be
attributed to a situative misjudgement on the side of the trained
interrogator. The buck finally stops amidst a newly inaugurated class of
torture professionals, which specialises in remaining invisible to any
form of public and legal scrutiny.

Such a logic of self-immunisation repeats itself at the transatlantic
level. We know that CIA flights transported suspects to foreign
detention camps, that they used European airports and European
infrastructure, and that apparently some of those camps were located in
Eastern member states of the EU. As a matter of fact, and contrary to a
public self-image that Europeans occasionally tend to cast, Europe has
been integral in practices of torture and extraordinary rendition in the
wake of the global war on terror. The relevant information is contained
in a report by Dick Marty, a Swiss representative to the Council of
Europe, on 'Alleged Secret Detentions and Unlawful Inter-state Transfers
Involving Council of Europe Member States\'. Yet, while stirring up a
great deal of public interest, the report was ultimately of little
consequence. It fell victim to the problem it described. In the wake of
an effective buck-passing of political responsibility, all it could do
was diligently compile information that had already been available in
the news media. The major finding of the report --- that there were
indeed secret detentions and extraordinary renditions, yet no one was
accountable for them --- defined precisely the limit of the report\'s
political effect. The transatlantic division of labour thus operates
much like the division of labour between the CIA and the Department of
Justice. From the point of view of the US, Europe is not quite living up
to its commitments to burden sharing, being only of tacit and reluctant
help. Hence, the US has to carry most of the weight in the war on
terror, and, by implication, needs 'to get her hands dirty'. From a
European point of view, the factual degree of involvement comfortably
pales in comparison with US transgressions. From the moral high ground,
then, how precisely Europe has been and still is involved becomes almost
invisible. Both Europe and the United States can cast their definitions
of the situation in terms of 'the West'. Europe holds up Western values
damaged in Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and Fallujah. The US, on the other
hand, actually does defend 'the West'. In between such conflicting
understandings of 'the West', political accountability evaporates.

[This is precisely how a political logic of risk management]{.underline}
Footnote13 [operates: [by **delegating away political responsibilities**
to]{.mark} anonymous layers of **technocratic** and [**expertocratic**
competency]{.mark}]{.underline}, all the more clandestine if
intelligence agencies are involved. [[The **depoliticising effect** of
**securitisation** is]{.mark} thus **[routinised]{.mark}** and tacitly
institutionalised]{.underline}. [[Rather than a **situative response**
to a **particular threat**, which may be **countered and then go away**,
the]{.mark} practical [consequences of **securitisation** can]{.mark}
thus [be]{.mark} extended for an **[indefinite]{.mark}** period of time
--- [by **translating**]{.mark} the **hyper-political logic of
[security]{.mark}** [into a **bureaucratic logic of risk
management**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Conclusions

[**Giving up on an essentialist conceptualisation** and **focusing
instead** on **performative references** to and invocations of **'the
West'** by no means dilutes the resulting image]{.underline}, as
essentialisers often seem to fear. On the contrary, it was only through
an open, reconstructive focus on manifold and fragmented uses of the
West that we could render visible a dynamic of genuinely 'Western'
securitisation. [Different articulations in scholarly and political
discourse do not add up to a coherent entity that can then be tagged as
'the West'. Rather, **'the West'** is quite literally an **essentially
contested concept** as it becomes **politically efficacious** only to
the extent that it is articulated in specific, locally and contextually
circumscribed situations]{.underline}. [However, all]{.underline} three
[research fields support the conclusion that 'the West' tends to be
marked as normatively valuable and preferable to that which is not
Western]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**to the extent that it is cast as a
threatened entity** that ought to be **defended at all cost**, that is,
**to the extent** that **'the West' is being securitised**, it **assumes
the role** of a discursive attractor, as if it were a '**gravitational
centre**' that **channels political communication through a
securitisation filter**. With a 'securitised West' looming in the
background, transatlantic discord might not escalate to the point of
open conflict and antagonism but might rather remain tied to a
particular structure of conflict, in which different articulations of
how precisely 'the West' ought to be defended are at stake]{.underline}.

References to 'the West' as a carrier of collective identity, then,
account for the rapid build-up of rhetorical heat, yet these very
references also delimit the possible scope of antagonism. At the same
time, however, [as a self-securitising community 'the West' exerts a
**discursive pull**, which places the semantics of security and thus the
**authorisation of extraordinary measures** squarely at the centre of
political conduct. Self-assertion, **self-authorisation**, and
self-immunisation are just three **institutional consequences** of such
a **securitisation pull**. In the case of **NATO**, these dynamics of
**self-authorisation** seem to be most obvious regarding the
**reconstituting effects** of its **strategic discourse** and its global
projection of (military) power today]{.underline}. The debate on
'China\'s rise' and its consequences for the coherence and future of
'the West' brings to mind the potential differences between the US and
European states where references to assumed universal values might
enhance a self-assertion of 'the West'. In the field of torture and
extraordinary renditions we can observe how the very principles of 'the
West' are undermined by the bureaucratic self-immunisation against
political accountability.

Obviously, [the **[freelance authorisation of]{.mark} means of
[violence]{.mark}** in the wake of securitisation processes and the
accompanying tendencies of self-assertion and self-immunisation are
[**diametrically opposed** to]{.mark} the **[self-understanding]{.mark}
of 'the West'** [as]{.mark} a community of **[liberal
democracies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nested in such self-descriptions,
processes of securitisation cannot be conceptualised as a one-way
street, where a secular trend of militant depoliticisation relentlessly
rolls over whatever modest barriers to the unilateral use of force have
been erected. By prioritising executive authorisation and a technocratic
output orientation, securitisation dynamics invoke, if only negatively,
a legal--democratic 'culture of formalism' (Koskenniemi 2001, 2009),
which insists on input legitimation, due process norms, and a rigid
oversight of executive authority. [Bearing this in mind, both
securitisation and desecuritisation can be framed as uniquely and
characteristically Western projects. Hence, **Western securitisation**
dynamics can only be understood as a **discursive [shift]{.mark}**
[**away** from a **legal**]{.mark}**ly enshrined** [culture of
**restraint**]{.mark} and [towards]{.mark} self-reinforcing processes of
**dramatisation** and **[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In other
words, [while processes of **securitisation** are indeed **dangerously
self-reinforcing**, they **do not operate in a vacuum**, thus triggering
escalation spirals and a contact surface for public counter-reactions at
the same time. They are **nested** not in a fixed set of shared values,
but rather in a distinctly **Western structure of conflict** where
**securitisation** dynamics and the **desecuritising safeguards** of
legal formalism stand in **polar opposition**. As discursive attractors
they constitute **gravitational centres** in an open force field of
**social interaction**. They **provide alternative rationales and
justification narratives**, which collide in everyday political
practice. **Whether securitisation dynamics successfully trump attempts
at politicisation**, democratisation, or constitutionalisation is **a
matter of open-ended social struggles** where **each discursive shift
alters a complex relational configuration**, thus **opening up new
avenues of contestation**]{.underline}.

[Historically contingent and reversible as it may be, however, in
all]{.underline} three [cases we do observe a significant bias towards
more assertive forms of self-authorisation to the detriment of
formal-legal restraint]{.underline}. [At present, the securitisation
pull seems to be stronger than the appeal of what used to be hailed as
core commitments of the Western community of states]{.underline}.
Specifically, [[**to the extent** that the institution]{.mark}al
infrastructure [of **the West revolves**]{.mark} **centrally [around
NATO]{.mark}** as a classical security institution turned global
security player, **institutional [reform]{.mark}** [is **predicated on
imaginaries of the relative geopolitical position of 'the
West'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As **China**]{.underline}]{.mark}
([[and]{.underline}]{.mark} probably **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[are]{.mark} being [portrayed]{.mark} not only as competitors but

Apart from being a highly relevant problem, HW also presents a
particularly fitting case to be analysed as an instance of anxiety
geopolitics. First, [the close link between HW and anxiety has been
explicitly recognised by Maria Mälksoo, who shows how HW triggers
'anxiety about the difficulties of concretising unknown and
indeterminate threats']{.underline} (**[Mälksoo, 2018]{.underline}**, p.
378). Second, [the relation between HW and geopolitics is at the same
time strongly pronounced and marked by a profound tension. On the one
hand, **HW ostensibly departs from a 'modern' geopolitical imagination
based on territorial states** and borders]{.underline} (Ó Tuathail,
1998). After all, [it is about **information operations in
deterritorialised spaces** of the globalised public sphere,
**unattributable cyberattacks carried out by non-state groups**, or the
**incitement of horizontal protest movements** discontent with the
present political order]{.underline}. [**On the other hand**, this
'postmodern' geopolitical imagination]{.underline} (ibid.) [has been
very often **subdued to the much more traditional** and 'modern' vision
of a **'new Cold War' between Russia and 'the West'**]{.underline} (for
critical analyses of this discourse see Browning, 2018; Ciută & Klinke,
2010; Toal, 2017). Thereby, [[**HW** has been incorporated into the
**civilisational mode** of]{.mark} geopolitical [thinking that **divides
the world along an East/West axis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Approaching HW as a case of anxiety geopolitics allows us to analyse
this tension and unpack the underlying puzzle: Why is it that the
**ostensibly novel, networked and deterritorialised phenomena**
associated with hybrid warfare get so **easily submerged** under such an
**old, static and territorial geopolitical imagination**?]{.underline}
We argue that [the allure of **East/West geopolitics** lies in its
**familiarity**, as it provides a well-worn map that **[promises to
'make sense' of the anxiety-inducing manifestations of 'hybrid
war]{.mark}fare'**]{.underline}. [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, we also
show that [[**these attempts eventually fail** and]{.mark} the **[HW
discourse ends up perpetuating the]{.mark} insecurities and
[anxieties]{.mark}, which [it was supposed to
resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As such, it serves well to 'a
'**hybrid-industrial complex**' of government agencies,
think-tanks]{.underline}, non-governmental organizations
([NGOs]{.underline}) [and pundits' that emerged around it]{.underline}
(Galeotti, 2019, p. 11). By [**[pointing out]{.mark} to [the role of
anxiety geopolitics]{.mark}** [in this economy of
**power/knowledge**]{.mark} that emerged **around HW**]{.underline},
this article [[provides]{.mark} **both** an **analysis** and [a
**political intervention**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The article proceeds as follows. First, we start by a theoretical
discussion, crafting the notion of anxiety geopolitics by developing and
connecting insights of the literatures on critical geopolitics,
ontological security, and politics of anxiety. Second, we argue that
[the amalgamation of the **hybrid warfare** discourse and **East/West
geopolitics** presents a particular case of anxiety geopolitics, which
**oscillates** between the **promise to repress anxiety** and the
**repeated failures in doing so**]{.underline}. This is illustrated by
examples from Czechia, a country considered as playing a pioneering and
outsized role in the European HW debate (Daniel & Eberle, 2021;
Jankowicz, 2020), which offers plenty of empirical material for
developing our theoretical argument and drawing some more general
implications. By way of conclusion, we discuss the broader take-aways
for critical geopolitics and IR, as well as [[for **policy
debates**]{.mark} on **how (not) to address the threat posed by
Russia**]{.underline}.

2\. Anxiety geopolitics: space, affect, and ontological insecurity

Our research is located in critical geopolitics, from which we borrow
the understanding of geopolitics as discourses and practices through
which people ''spatialize' international politics and represent it as a
'world' characterized by particular types of places, peoples and dramas'
(Ó Tuathail & Agnew, 1992, p. 192). Critical geopolitics focuses on how
political events are articulated as somehow related to or driven by
geographic phenomena, or how issues are 'geopoliticised', that is
constructed as geopolitical problems (Cadier, 2019, p. 71). These ideas
are best captured by the concept of geopolitical imagination:
'Geopolitical imaginations are the result of subjects' attempt to make
sense of the world by associating political values with various parts of
that map. They can also be spoken of in the collective sense, in which a
group can be said to have similar (if ultimately unique) visions of the
world.' (Dittmer & Dodds, 2008, p. 447) More recently, critical
geopolitics has paid increased attention to affects and emotions
(Gökarıksel & Secor, 2020; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013; Pain, 2009).1
Such affective geopolitics explores how affects are an indivisible part
of social construction of space, as they are intimately entangled with
languages and images through which our 'mental maps' are produced and
disseminated. Summarising this broader argument, Laketa argues that
geopolitics should be understood 'both as socially produced and
intimately experienced' and, consequently, 'the emotional and the
affective become the site of the geopolitical' and vice versa (Laketa,
2019, pp. 156, 160). Therefore, international politics is spatialised
also by engaging subjects at the affective level, which is an essential
part of the production of geopolitical imaginations through which
subjects view the world and their place within it. This links critical
geopolitics to a range of literatures that deal with the relationship
between identity, emotions and affects, including the scholarship on
ontological security and anxiety in IR.

The rapidly growing literature on ontological security is concerned with
how subjects -- individuals, groups, or states -- deal with the
uncertainty of modern life without losing the 'security of the self, the
subjective sense of who one is' (Mitzen, 2006, p. 344) that defines
ontological security and makes life bearable. Building mainly upon the
work of Anthony Giddens (1991), classical contributions agree that
ontological security is sought through an active process of constructing
the self and anchoring it in the social world, which happens through the
establishment of routines (Mitzen, 2006), creation of biographical
narratives (Kinnvall, 2004; Steele, 2008; Subotić, 2016), or maintenance
of relationships (Berenskoetter & Giegerich, 2010). The key underlying
purpose of ontological security-seeking is to avoid anxiety, which
Giddens, following Freud, understands as an elusive and paralysing
'generalised state of \[...\] emotions' that is different from fear
(Giddens, 1991, p. 44). Fear is 'a basic emotion directed at a specific
object that prompts an adaptive response: fight or flight.' (Kinnvall &
Mitzen, 2020, p. 241). In contrast, 'anxiety is diffuse, it is
free-floating: lacking a specific object', which makes it possible to
'pin' it to different things and concepts (Giddens, 1991, p. 44).
Repressing the elusive anxiety by this 'pinning', which transforms it
into the manageable fear of something, is then one of the key motives of
human behaviour. As anxiety is considered overwhelming and paralysing;
the 'chaos' that 'threatens on the other side of the ordinariness of the
everyday conventions' (1991, p. 37), subjects often prefer to deal with
it through the production of fear via the discursive construction of
'specific objects and threats' (Chernobrov, 2019, p. 39). This involves
reaching to well-worn identity discourses, which serve as vehicles for
'\[t\]ransforming the anxiety of the unknown into the security of the
known (recognizable, even if illusory) \[that\] affirms the identity of
the perceiving subject and enables it to confidently interact with the
international other.' (ibid.)

These arguments have a direct purchase for critical geopolitics, as
geopolitical imaginations are good examples of how such sense-making and
anxiety-managing discourses can look like. Some have already recognised
and developed this link. For Guzzini, the 'revival of geopolitical
thought' in Europe is directly linked to ontological insecurity stemming
from 'the sense of disorientation and foreign policy identity crises
which followed 1989.' (Guzzini, 2016, pp. 14--15) Making a more explicit
link between anxiety and fear, Browning develops a very similar
argument: 'The attraction of tropes of a new Cold War and a return of
geopolitics is precisely that they solve anxiety about current events by
fitting them into clearly established systems of meaning, though doing
so entails reducing anxiety by emphasising a world of threats and fears'
(Browning, 2018, p. 113).

Both Guzzini and Browning are critical of using geopolitics as a tool of
anxiety management, citing its adverse effects both in normative terms
(creation of enemy-images, building an exclusionary 'Fortress Europe'),
and in the consequential decrease in physical security (e.g. as a result
of escalating tensions between antagonists locked-in in their hardened
identities). However, both also appear to ground their argument in the
assumption that anxiety ultimately can be managed (more or less)
successfully, one that is shared by the Giddensian mainstream of
ontological security studies. While scholars making such arguments would
consider the price of anxiety-management via geopolitics as too steep,
they still accept that such a trade-off can be made in the first place
and that one\'s ontological security can in fact be gained at the
expense of physical security or the well-being of others. As some of the
most recent debates in ontological security scholarship recognise
(Browning, 2019; Cash, 2020; Gustafsson & Krickel-Choi, 2020; Kinnvall &
Mitzen, 2020; Rumelili, 2020), these issues stem from Giddens\'
problematic conceptualisation of anxiety that is adopted by most
ontological security work in critical geopolitics and IR. To sharpen the
analysis of the role of anxiety in geopolitics and deepen the critique
made by Guzzini and Browning, an additional theoretical step is needed.

For this purpose, we reach to the literature on the politics of anxiety
drawing mainly on the work of Jacques Lacan, a psychoanalyst whose ideas
have been increasingly prolific in IR (for an authoritative overview see
Zevnik & Mandelbaum, 2021), and, to a lesser extent, critical
geopolitics (Klinke, 2016; Laketa, 2019; Müller, 2013). Our approach
shares the Giddensian notion that anxiety is an inarticulable, traumatic
and potentially paralysing affect that subjects attempt to avoid and
repress. However, instead of seeing it as merely something that 'lurks'
behind as the dark other of normal life, anxiety is understood as a
durable affective condition interwoven in everyday experiences as well
as social processes and political institutions. It doesn\'t just lurk,
it is always already there, as it is present in the key mechanisms that
hold society together: in the production of social subjects and the
creation of rules through which these are regulated and bound together.

In this reading, anxiety is correlative to the very emergence and
existence of the subject as such. It is 'a type of expectant dread' or
'a crushing experience of 'out of placeness'' that arises 'when the
subject, unable to ground themselves in either a functional horizon of
values or a reliable social or subjective identification, fears that
they might be somehow swallowed up, devoured' (Hook, 2015, pp. 117,
119). It is less about the disorientation and uncertainty caused by one
particular crisis (e.g. Russia invading Ukraine, Covid-19 arriving) and
more about being reminded of the ultimately irreducible fragility of all
things, including human lives and social orders. In this sense, anxiety
is an affect linked to experiencing the limit of one\'s own existence as
a subject, something that signifies the encounter with 'the real', to
use the Lacanian term for the internal limit of social order and/or the
biological limit of human existence. Anxiety can never be fully managed
or repressed, as it is a reaction to being confronted with what is for
Lacan the ultimate reality of human existence: the fundamental
'groundlessness of meaning' (Balaska, 2019, p. 25) and, therefore, the
impossibility of ever achieving a coherent and stable identity. In this
sense, anxiety is the affect that 'does not deceive' (Lacan, 2014, p.
160), as it does not cover over the void at the heart of every social
identity, but rather confronts us with it at the level of bodily
sensation. To put it differently, subjects are always ultimately
ontologically insecure, as no narratives, routines or relationships --
personal or geopolitical -- can ever fully deal with the omnipresent
possibility that things may not make sense and everything can break down
any minute. Anxiety emerges as the affect that signifies 'the need for
the stabilisation of the subject' (Burgess, 2017, p. 29), yet this
stabilisation is doomed to fail in the longer term.

Therefore, in contrast to readings that see it as an aberration, anxiety
is omnipresent, even though it clearly varies in its intensity across
time and space. Sometimes it is experienced more often and more
strongly, while there may be other, less anxious times (Solomon, 2012
makes this argument with respect to affects in general). The current
social condition is arguably one when anxiety is on the high; leading
some authors to argue that we are now living in an 'anxious society', 'a
society on constant alert, despite having no identifiable existential
threat. Instead, there is the constant presence of the possibility of
that threat, and with it, the sense that government cannot fully protect
the people and that danger resides in the everyday' (Kinnvall & Mitzen,
2020, p. 247, emph. added; Eklundh et al., 2017). Such (highly) anxious
society was created by the congruence of a range of factors. Some point
to the effects of neoliberalism and austerity that produce the
widespread feelings of powerlessness and loss of control (Hirvonen,
2017). Others focus on the social media economy that requires users who
are constantly obsessively checking for news updates, notifications and
the affective gratification coming from 'retweets' and 'likes' (Davies,
2019). For yet others, the proliferation of anxiety is connected to the
societal changes linked to gender, race and immigration (Ali & Whitham,
2018; Klinke, 2016; Zevnik, 2017b), or the 'security creep' perpetuated
by discourses and practices of counterterrorism and cybersecurity
(Heath-Kelly, 2018; Jacobsen, 2020).

This extended understanding of anxiety as ontologically conditioned and
socially circulated 'nervous states' (Davies, 2019) without a clear and
concrete referent object opens the possibility to think (geo)politics of
anxiety in broader and arguably more critical terms than in conventional
ontological security literature. On the one hand, the Lacanian approach
broadly agrees with the Giddensian ontological security framework with
respect to how subjects try to deal with anxiety: by 'pinning' it onto
an object and transforming it into a more tangible fear of something. In
this manner, 'fear becomes a way of easing anxiety; of attaching a
signifier (an object of fear) to what is otherwise an unfounded
experience of unease' (Zevnik, 2017a, p. 237). Such 'politics of fear'
then transforms the crushing and paralysing experience of anxiety into
the management of 'concrete objects that we have invented' (Hirvonen,
2017, p. 261), such as the geopolitically coded 'Muslim terrorists' or
'Russians hackers'. In this step, anxiety is ostensibly eased or
repressed by the production of (geopolitical) narratives that 'make
sense' of the unpleasant experience by giving it a name and placing it
on a map.2

On the other hand, however, the Lacanian take allows us to account also
for the politics that is imminent in the failure of these
anxiety-managing attempts. As we have argued, [all narratives built
around particular objects of fear, including geopolitical ones, are
eventually failing, as these objects are ultimately 'false targets'.
They are merely temporary discursive vessels functioning as placeholders
for expressing deeper ontological anxiety, which is bound to strike
back. Consequently, **attempts to make societies (feel) more secure,
habitually end up making them (feel) equally, or even more, insecure and
anxious, regardless of how much effort is invested into fighting this or
that particular threat**]{.underline}. As Heath-Kelly (2015, 2018) and
Jacobsen (2020) have shown, [successful security discourses like
counter-terrorism or **cybersecurity** have actually managed to
internalise this 'failure to secure']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015)
[by incorporating it into their very structure]{.underline}. According
to them, [counter-terrorism and **[cybersecurity]{.mark}** are
[constructed as dangers **so slippery and multifaceted** that once we
resolve]{.mark} one problem]{.underline} ([by killing Osama bin Laden,
**resolving [a particular cyberthreat]{.mark}**]{.underline}), [[**a
whole new range** of]{.mark} terrorist groups or [cyber issues emerges
to **occupy their place**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Consequently, and in contrast to conventional ontological security
literature, politics of anxiety is not only about managing and
repressing it through [narratives]{.mark}, routines and relationships.
It is also about other ways of **[manipulating anxiety for political
purposes]{.mark}**, including reproducing, nurturing and [spreading it
via]{.mark} the [construction of **threats so opaque and
widespread**]{.mark} that [they **cannot be possibly resolved**,
like]{.mark} terrorism, **[cybersecurity]{.mark}** -- [or **hybrid
war**]{.mark}**fare**]{.underline}. [By its **[repeated failure to
secure]{.mark}**, such discourses **[hold societies in the]{.mark}
anxious '[state of constant]{.mark} and [heightened
alertness]{.mark}'**]{.underline} (Davies, 2019, p. xii), [making them
**[ready to accept]{.mark}** a range of **[pre-emptive security measures
across all]{.mark} possible [areas of social
life]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Bringing the argument together, [by the notion of anxiety geopolitics we
conceptualise the politics of dealing with anxiety by linking it to
objects and issues spatialised through the means of geopolitical
imaginations]{.underline}. [By references to geographical categories,
such as states, regions]{.underline}, continents [or civilisations, this
type of affective geopolitics promises to transform the amorphous and
ambiguous anxiety stemming from range of different issues into tangible
and manageable objects of fear taking the form of geopolitical threats.
Yet, as all such narratives and images are ultimately bound to fail to
resolve the underlying anxiety, the analytical focus must be extended
also to how these failures are accounted for and how anxiety is being
further reproduced with the help of geopolitical
imaginations]{.underline}. Therefore, [anxiety geopolitics is ultimately
about the oscillation between repressing anxiety through the
geopoliticisation of both the 'threat' and the self, as much as it is
about dealing with the recurring failures to secure the subjects
produced by such geopoliticisation, which result in reproduction of
social anxiety]{.underline}.

3\. Hybrid warfare as anxiety geopolitics: learning from the Czech case

We will now further develop our conceptual argument by discussing hybrid
warfare as a case of anxiety geopolitics. [Some have already shown that
HW plays an ontological security role at the level of
**NATO**]{.underline} and EU, [as it '**links** the **uncertainty**
emanating from the **hybrid** nature of the **new threats** to the
**known** and routine relationship with its **traditional antagonist**',
that is **Russia**]{.underline} (**[Mälksoo, 2018]{.underline}**, p.
380). Following this argument, [**[Russia\'s aggression]{.mark}**
suddenly **[gave meaning to a range of hitherto unconnected]{.mark}**,
yet omnipresent, and, therefore, **[anxiety-inducing problems]{.mark}**
that **NATO**]{.underline}, EU [and their member states were facing.
**Polarisation** and the rise of **[populism]{.mark}**, widespread
**distrust in institutions**, **[erosion of]{.mark} international
[norms]{.mark}**, **[cyberattacks]{.mark}**, propaganda and
**[disinformation]{.mark}** campaigns suddenly **[all 'made
sense']{.mark}**, [if]{.mark} they could be [discursively linked
to]{.mark} Moscow as instances of '**[Russian hybrid war]{.mark}fare**'.
HW thus [provided **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and EU, [with
[the]{.mark} elusive **['security' of knowing one\'s
enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline} (also **[Browning, 2018]{.underline}**).

Similarly, in Czechia, the HW discourse arrived at a time of intense
social anxieties emerging from a range of different cultural, economic
or geopolitical factors. For many in Czechia (and Central Europe more
broadly), [post-Cold War sense of ontological security had been provided
through a **civilisational geopolitical imagination of 'the
West'**]{.underline}, which Central Europe supposedly (re)joined after
1989 (Cadier, 2019; Kuus, 2007; Todorova, 2009). Best captured by the
slogan of a 'return to Europe', the vision of embracing liberal
democracy, capitalism and Euro-Atlantic political structures was seen as
a panacea that would resolve all big (geo)political questions once and
for all. However, these very principles and structures arguably started
crumbling precisely at the time that the Central Europeans were finally
admitted in EU and NATO. The Iraq War laid bare the rifts within the
West, calling in question its further relevance as a coherent
geopolitical entity (Browning & Lehti, 2010; Jackson, 2006). Resurgent
Russia challenged Western hegemony in Europe and led 'an influential
part of the Czech political and intellectual elite \[to\] succumb\[...\]
to anxiety' (Drulák, 2012, p. 79). Central European countries were hit
particularly hard by the economic crisis and further hurt themselves by
the (foreign- or self-imposed) 'Western' medicine of austerity (Tooze,
2018, pp. 220--238). In the Czech case, this led to one of the longest
periods of economic recovery in Europe, accompanied by a free-fall in
public trust in institutions, with only one in ten Czechs expressing
trust in the government (11%) and the Chamber of Deputies (10%) at the
lowest point in 2012/2013 (CVVM, 2013). Add to this the rise of
illiberalism at home and increasing divides between the 'old' and 'new'
EU member states, laid bare especially during the so called 'refugee
crisis' of 2015--2016. As a consequence, you end up with a region that
is not so sure about its feeling about and towards 'the West' any longer
(Kazharski, 2018; Krastev & Holmes, 2019).

Put differently, by mid-2010s, the Czech society was already in a state
of anxiety and uncertainty about its own geopolitical identity and in
search for ontological fixes.3 This is where the HW discourse clicks in
following Russia\'s aggression against Ukraine in 2014. To the liberal
voices that dominate security debates, hybrid warfare could be used to
put a name on this anxiety and thereby attempt to suppress it by the
construction of familiar geopolitical narratives. By invoking the prism
of a conflict between a liberal-democratic West and an authoritarian
Russia, all sorts of problems -- spread of misinformation, return of
nationalism, technological transformations or global power shifts --
could be reduced to the logic of civilisational confrontation. This is
the conventional ontological security part of the story, to which we add
another step by showing how this promise of security is never actually
fulfilled. Due to the supposed invisibility and omnipresence of hybrid
threats and the insecure position the Czechs occupy in their own
East/West geopolitical imagination, there is a surplus of anxiety that
cannot be successfully managed.

The case study is structured according to the two 'faces' of the
Janus-faced politics of anxiety. First, we show how [**hybrid warfare**
was **[used as a sense-making device]{.mark}** promising [to]{.mark}
manage anxiety by providing a conceptual link between a broad range of
social issues and anchoring them within the familiar East/West
geopolitical imagination]{.underline}. [This linking could
simultaneously **make hybrid warfare meaningful** by geopoliticising it,
and **[reinforce the crumbling]{.mark} East/[West geopolitical
imagination by showing its renewed relevance in facing hybrid
war]{.mark}fare**]{.underline}. Second, we show how [[the **fleeting
sense of ontological security** achieved]{.mark} via this articulation
[**gets undone** by the]{.mark} recurring **[re-emergence of surplus
anxiety]{.mark}** and how HW ends up reproducing and **[perpetuating
the]{.mark} sense of [insecurity]{.mark} and anxiety [it was supposed to
resolve]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [[analysis is **grounded
in**]{.mark} a range of **[empirical materials]{.mark}** from **2014 to
2020**, [including **official documents**]{.mark}, media **articles**,
popular **books** [and]{.mark} **parliamentary
[debates]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Two caveats are in order. First, both
Czech government and civil society have responded to the perceived
threat of HW in many ways, including creating new official institutions
and informal initiatives tailored to deal with it (Daniel & Eberle,
2018). In this article, we focus on the discourse that made these
responses possible. Second, as shown elsewhere (Daniel & Eberle, 2021),
the Czech HW discourse is not monolithic and includes different
understandings of what exactly constitutes a threat to whom, ranging
from military operations targeting public infrastructures all the way to
individual citizen\'s struggles with media literacy. In this article,
though, we downplay these differences and instead focus on the
commonalities that tie these different notions together as parts of
ostensibly the same problem of Russia\'s 'hybrid warfare'.

3.1. Repressing anxiety: making sense of hybrid warfare through
East/West geopolitics

Starting with the repression side of anxiety geopolitics, this can be
observed in the successive steps through which ontological security is
sought by associating a range of issues with hybrid warfare and then
pinning HW onto the familiar map of East/West geopolitical imagination.
This consists of four interrelated discursive moves: identifying the
supposed 'origin' of societal unease, putting a name of the problem,
localising it in space, and endowing it with broader geopolitical
meanings. In this particular case, [Russia\'s **invasion of
Ukraine**]{.underline} in 2014 [serves as the]{.underline} supposed
original moment and [**'cause' of anxiety**, **hybrid warfare** is the
**name** presented to make sense of what is going on, **Russia** is
**constructed as the threat**, and **civilisational East/West
geopolitics** is used to **give the situation broader
meaning**]{.underline}. Let us now discuss each of these steps in turn.

First, a certain event needs to be constructed as a supposed point of
origin of the perceived unease, a 'crisis' that dislocates the symbolic
order (Nabers, 2015). This is the first move in the repression of
anxiety, one in which an 'actually existing' empirical event is
discursively presented as the apparent cause of the deeper ontological
crisis that is affectively experienced as anxiety. In the HW discourse
in Czechia, Russia\'s aggression against Ukraine of 2014 is presented as
such profoundly shocking and dislocating event. As the otherwise rather
down-to-earth and matter-of-fact military intellectual, Karel Řehka,
puts it: 'the Russian Federation shocked the whole world. The
unimaginable was broken into.' (Řehka, 2017, p. 199) 'Shock' and
'helplessness' are words used also by a high-ranking Czech diplomat
(personal interview, Prague, August 4, 2020). A leading Czech
think-tanker then recalls how 'surprised' he was by Russia\'s invasion
and how 'disorganised and fragmented' the security debates were in the
months that followed (Janda, 2017). The affective experience is captured
well also in a widely cited and circulated popular book, which vividly
describes how 'we are walking on the edge of a cliff' and
'\[u\]ncertainty is the only thing that you can count on these days'
(Alvarová, 2017, p. 20). Therefore, 2014 was constructed as a radical
breakthrough into a much more insecure world. Yet, this move of
identifying the supposed origin of these dizzying feelings of anxiety in
one particular event was at the same time already the first step of
seeking ontological security by making sense of it.

A second step is putting the name on the problem. It is only the
performative and affect-laden performance of naming that connects
disparate phenomena together and creates a discursive 'object' that can
be then dealt with politically (Laclau, 2005). In our case, this leads
to the creative appropriation of the concepts of 'hybrid warfare' and
'hybrid threats', which were virtually non-existent in the Czech public
discourse prior to 2014 (Daniel & Eberle, 2018), and using them as a
linchpin that connects all sorts of societal problems. For an
authoritative Czech security document, 'hybrid threat' is a 'way to wage
a confrontation or a conflict', one that is characterised by an
extraordinarily broad spectrum of measures: 'a wide, complex, adaptable,
and integrated combination of conventional and unconventional means,
overt and covert activities, characterised primarily by coercion and
subversion' (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p.
127). The range of actors that can execute such methods is similarly
broad, including 'military, paramilitary, and various civilian actors'
(ibid.). Similarly, an overview of a 'Russian hybrid strategy' provided
by the counterintelligence service includes 'interpretation of modern
history', different ways of 'information warfare',
'networking/infiltration' across the fields of politics, economy, crime,
espionage, culture and education, and military/guerrilla operations
alike (Security Information Service, 2018, p. 7). In statements like
these, hybrid warfare is stretched so as to incorporate almost anything
that can be understood as a hostile activity. A such, it becomes an
universal object of fear, broad enough to be used as a placeholder for
all sorts of anxieties.

In the third move, hybrid warfare is territorialised by pointing to
Russia as its ultimate source. The 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination
of hybrid warfare in terms of flows, clouds and infrastructures, is
backgrounded in favour of the 'modern' territorial East/West geopolitics
of a Russian threat. In certain cases, this means little more than
merely pointing out that it is indeed Russia that 'has executed hybrid
operations \[ ...\], including targeted disinformation activities and
cyber-attacks', as the Defence Strategy (Ministry of Defence of the
Czech Republic, 2017, p. 7) puts it explicitly and other documents hint
at implicitly (e.g. Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic,
2015). More interesting are the instances which present Russia not only
as one source of threats, but as an orchestrator coordinating all
possible means and actors. In such cases, the 'postmodern' geopolitical
imagination of networks is used and reproduced, yet with a key twist:
such networks are seen as hierarchical, with centre in Moscow. In this
logic, different domestic actors -- 'alternative news' websites
spreading anti-Western narratives, right-wing populists, even contrarian
intellectuals -- can ultimately be tied to an overall Russia\'s
masterplan (for an example see Janda & Kundra, 2016). The
counterintelligence agency reports are an example of this
'puppet-master' approach. One of them lists 'covert infiltration of
Czech media and the Internet' and 'foundation of puppet organizations,
covert and open support of populist or extremist subjects' among the key
activities of Russia\'s 'information operations' (Security Information
Service, 2016, p. 9). Another outlines this logic in colourful detail,
claiming that 'Russia is creating a structure in Europe drawing on the
concept of the Comintern (the Communist International; the Third
International) founded by the Soviet Union' (Security Information
Service, 2015, p. 11), an organised network of all sorts of actors 'with
pro-Russian stances or fighting against the system' (ibid., 12).

However, different actors can be labelled as agents or instrument of HW
and then geopoliticised and linked to Russia not only by direct
association, but also because they are merely voicing opinions that can
be somehow qualified as 'pro-Russian'. As a more recent
counterintelligence report puts it, actually an 'overwhelming majority
of disinformation websites in Czech are the work of Czech \[...\]
citizens, who are not supported by Russian entities.' (Security
Information Service, 2018, p. 8) Nevertheless, this still makes them a
part of a broader geopolitical threat, as 'these people and their
internet projects are misused by Russia to spread propaganda or support
other components of the hybrid strategy.' (ibid., 8) It is this
imagination of a Russian-orchestrated networked threat that enables a
leading Czech journalist to blankly dismiss the prominent disinformation
website, Aeronet. cz, as 'writing for Putin' (Kundra, 2016b), without
any evidence of links to the Russian state known at that point and with
his own subsequent investigations showing that this is most likely not
the case. It also makes it possible to deal with anxieties by
externalising the problem, such as when a popular book argues that
'Furious hate \[...\] is not Czech, it is something new, foreign. It
came from the outside and 'somehow' entered into us.' (Alvarová, 2017,
p. 88).

In the fourth and final move, this 'hybrid' struggle with Russia is
endowed with meaning by being inserted into the whole symbolic structure
of East/West civilisational geopolitics, in which '\[i\]ssues of
security and geopolitics are \[...\] reframed in cultural terms. They
become simultaneously geographical, cultural and strategic concepts, and
they diffuse into ever more spheres of political life.' (Kuus, 2007, p.
x) The societal anxieties that are managed via the narrative of hybrid
warfare emanating from Russia, are now also made part of an eternal
struggle between the East and the West. This reactivates the 'mental
maps', in which 'the West' functions as a desired point of
identification and a promise of security and prosperity, whereas 'the
East' is seen as 'an abyss', a notion 'which in the Czech political
discourse refers less to a geographical space than to ontological
categories defining the alienated past of the Czech Republic.' (Cadier,
2019, p. 84) As one member of parliament, Jan Bartošek, put it, the
Czechs are left with an unequivocal choice: 'either we will be part of
NATO as a firm ally of our pro-Western orientation, or we will be just
one of Russia\'s many colonies. There is no third way.' (in Chamber of
Deputies, 2018a).

In statements like these, Russia is presented as a fundamentally
different entity, a quintessentially Oriental actor, belonging to a
different 'universe' that 'until nowadays has not met' with the European
one (Alvarová, 2017, p. 70). Echoing classical Orientalist tropes,
Russians supposedly rely on '\[m\]ysticism, irrationality, associational
instead of logical thinking -- thus, a model of thinking that is of
different civilisation, the one we know rather from the Orient'
(Alvarová, 2017, p. 193). The potentially catastrophic consequences of
allying with Russia are then often presented through references to the
past, reinforcing the notion that what is at stake in HW is in fact yet
another instance of a historical struggle between civilisations. 'Many
of us probably know our modern history, from 1945 through 1948, Russian
advisers, death of \[foreign minister\] Jan Masaryk, occupation in 1968.
The Russian influence, which simply broke us away from the West, ripped
us from \[our\] democratic development, and has incalculable economic
consequences stretching to this day.' (Helena Langšádlová in Chamber of
Deputies, 2018b).

[This idea that issues like propaganda, misinformation or rise of
populism are instances of a dramatic geopolitical confrontation, is
finally driven home also by the notion that it is **the West as a
whole** that is **under attack**, not just any individual
country]{.underline}. According to a counterintelligence report, 'the
goal of the Russian hybrid campaign' is '[primarily to weaken
**NATO**]{.underline} and the EU internally, e.g. by weakening
individual member states' (Security Information Service, 2018, p. 7).
Therefore, should the Czechs fail to defend themselves, they are
supposedly endangering something much bigger. According to a member of
parliament, Jan Lipavský, what the Russians want is 'to break European
unity' (Chamber of Deputies, 2018b). Such ideas connect hybrid warfare
squarely to the Messianistic undertones of the East/West geopolitical
imagination, in which the Central Europeans serve as guardians defending
the West at its limit. To paraphrase Milan Kundera\'s (1984)
foundational essay on Central European civilisational geopolitics, by
fighting hybrid warfare, the Czechs are risking 'dying for Czechia and
the West', which indeed gives a sense of deep purpose and meaning to
their cause and produces a strong anxiety-repressing narrative.

To sum up this part, one important aspect of the anxiety geopolitics of
hybrid warfare lies in the way how it allows channelling deeper
anxieties by using the East/West geopolitical imagination to produce
familiar storylines, identities and objects of fear. [Despite being
constructed as multifaceted, broad and difficult to detect, hybrid
warfare is made legible by being projected on a familiar 'mental map',
where it becomes merely the most recent instance of long-lasting
struggle between the West and a fundamentally different, antagonist
Russia]{.underline}. However, the relationship between the discourses of
hybrid warfare and East/West geopolitics goes both ways: [HW is not only
territorialised by, but also gives broader meaning to and, in a way,
promises to reinforce the East/West civilisational geopolitics. It is in
and through HW that **Russia is constructed as fundamentally different**
and **the West** presented as a **coherent entity under attack**, as
well as something worth defending against the potentially tragic
alternatives. **Through** the **discourse of hybrid warfare**,
**doubts** about the **relevance or resilience of a West-centric
geopolitical order** are seemingly **brushed away** and **old
geopolitical identities are hardened**]{.underline}. This is precisely
the logic of ontological security that makes the ideas of a 'return of
geopolitics' and the 'new Cold War' so appealing, as shown by Guzzini
(2012, 2016) and Browning (2018).

3.2. Reproducing anxiety: danger is everywhere and the East is already
within

[The HW discourse arguably succeeds on the level of **meaning**, that is
in 'making sense' of the new threats by geopoliticising them in
East/West terms. In contrast, its **[success is]{.mark} only
[fleeting]{.mark} at best** [as an **anxiety-repressing ontological
fix**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this section, we focus on the other face
of anxiety geopolitics, showing how [the HW discourse also contributes
to the reproduction of anxiety]{.underline}. The argument that security
discourses end up perpetuating the very insecurity they promise to deal
with is not new (e.g. Campbell, 1998). More recently, Heath-Kelly (2018)
and Jacobsen (2020) have advanced it from an explicitly Lacanian
perspective and shown how the discourses of terrorism and cybersecurity
are inherently bound to disappoint the underlying desire for security.
[The endurance of these discourses is made possible by the way how they
**pre-emptively incorporate an explanation for their own failure**.
Terrorism and **cyberthreats** are constructed in such a **broad,
complex and omnipresent** manner that **no individual achievement can
lead to the resolution** of the problems presented by these discourses.
There are **always new risks and vulnerabilities**, as the destruction
or **neutralisation of no actually existing objects of
fear**]{.underline} (e.g. Osama bin Laden) **[can ultimately satisfy the
underlying ontological anxieties]{.underline}**. There is always
something else to worry about.

Building on Heath-Kelly and Jacobsen, our final argument is that hybrid
warfare works exactly like their examples, as HW, too, is a discourse
that is simultaneously anxiety-repressing and anxiety-reproducing. In
fact, we argue that the linking of HW and East/West geopolitics produces
a particularly strongly anxiety-ridden discourse. [[While **hybrid
war**]{.mark}**fare** [presents threats as **invisible** and
**omnipresent**]{.mark} due to their covert and networked nature,
[the]{.mark} East/[**West** imagination]{.mark} further [raises
the]{.mark} stakes and **[salience]{.mark}** of such threats by painting
them [as parts of a]{.mark} titanic **[civilisational
struggle]{.mark}**. The **[subjects produced]{.mark}** by such discourse
**[can never rest]{.mark}**, as what may be going on right behind their
noses is **not just one particular cyber-attack**, a single **conspiracy
theory** that has gained traction on Facebook, or merely one instance of
information stolen by a spy. Instead, it is a battle for the future of
**'the West'**]{.underline} and the Czech belonging to it, one where the
alternative option is the most tragic one: a descent deep into the
'abyss' of 'the East' (Cadier, 2019). We will now illustrate these
arguments by focusing on the unfathomability of HW, the shifting nature
of the threats it produces, and the anxieties inherent in the East/West
geopolitics that underpin it.

First, [the '**failure to secure**']{.underline} (Heath-Kelly, 2015) [is
pre-emptively incorporated in the HW discourse by its portrayal of the
looming dangers as **insidious**, invisible and even **impossible to
detect**]{.underline}. As a key security document states, '\[t\]he
principal risk to which a subject attacked by a hybrid campaign is
exposed lies in the fact that they will not be able to identify the
hybrid campaign -- in time, in its full scale, or at all' (Ministry of
the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 129). According to the
deputy Helena Langšádlová, what we are supposedly facing are highly
dangerous, yet 'creeping threats', which we 'cannot see on a day by day
basis' (in Chamber of Deputies, 2019). This leads some to claim that 'at
no point in history was it so extremely difficult to decide, if we are
at war, or not' (Táborský, 2019, p. 164). While there may be little
drama on the surface, no one can ever rest in this logic. [An attack may
be already underway, one that can even be approximated to war, literally
at any minute]{.underline}. As the Special Forces general, Karel Řehka,
put it at a conference organised in the Czech parliament: 'In a way, we
are already at war, we just do not realise it or are not able to admit
it.' (Lang, 2015) [This is a **mode of thinking** that **produces highly
anxious subjects**, in a **constant** sense of the '**expectant dread**'
that is anxiety]{.underline} (Hook, 2015, p. 117), [one not yet having a
clear referent and directed towards all possible yet still unknown
dangers that may materialise at any time]{.underline}.

[It is in these notions that an **unspecified existential threat** may
be **hidden behind mundane events**]{.underline} that the otherwise
backgrounded 'postmodern' geopolitical imagination of HW suddenly kicks
back in. If the 'modern' East/West geopolitical imagination 'made sense'
and provided at least some fleeting ontological security by pointing to
Russia, this is frustrated by the surplus anxiety produced via this
'postmodern' imagination of insidious, hidden networks operating in
physical and cyberspace alike. [In fact, as the discourse postulates, we
may not even know that it really is Russia in the first place that is
behind a particular incident, as hybrid attackers seek to create 'an
environment where responsibility for these activities cannot (at least
formally) be **[attributed]{.mark}** to them, or at least [**only
speculatively** and **with great difficulty**]{.mark}']{.underline}
(Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic, 2016, p. 127). We may
ultimately never know if this or that mundane event is actually not a
part of something much bigger, as it is the very aim of the attacker to
'prevent a clear interpretation of events and the discovery of their
interconnectedness' (Ministry of the Interior of the Czech Republic,
2016, p. 127). Therefore, [while the prevalent 'modern' geopolitical
reading of HW enables channelling anxiety by constructing Russia an
object of fear, it still remains far from the manageable fear of 'fight
or flight']{.underline} (Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 241). This is
[because these supposedly known aspects of the danger are constantly
being accompanied and disrupted by the **surplus anxiety** of the
'**unknown unknowns**' stemming from the partial inclusion of the
'postmodern' geopolitical reading. This **effectively pre-empts the HW
discourse from ever solving the problems it is supposedly designed to
tackle**, as it is wholly unclear how to act upon threats that we are
not yet aware of or do not know how to make sense of]{.underline}.

Second, this oscillation between the known and the unknown and between
fear and anxiety manifests itself in the constantly shifting
construction of what is supposed to be the exact nature of the threat
coming from Russia. This is best illustrated in the wording of the
annual reports of the Czech counterintelligence agency (SIS), which
reinforce the notion that Russia is indeed a severe threat, yet the
precise character and shape of this threat appears to be changing year
after year. As already mentioned, in first annual public report
reflecting on the situation after Russia\'s aggression against Ukraine,
the SIS warned that their assessment showed the formation of what was
spectacularly labelled as the 'New Reincarnation of the Comintern' -- a
loose network of allied actors, similar to the Cold War
Soviet-controlled network of ideologically affiliated political parties,
agitators and agents. The danger was portrayed as a new version of this
tried and tested strategy, which Russia supposedly employs to connect
different groups dissatisfied with the Western liberal democracy
(Security Information Service, 2015, pp. 11--12).

However, the spectre of the Comintern was a one-off, never to appear
again. Instead, SIS later concluded that the threat resided in a much
looser combination of often uncoordinated actions of Russian
intelligence, authentic Czech individuals not in any way linked to
Moscow but 'only' spreading their own 'pro-Russian' worldviews, and
finally, even in the lack of education about modern history in schools
(Security Information Service, 2018, pp. 6--8). This trend of diffusing
the danger from a Kremlin-coordinated network to seeing the threats in
mere ideological resonances further continued. The most recent report
notes that there is a 'transition from state-controlled or directed
activities to spontaneous actions' of like-minded actors. 'When Russian
state officials express what they desire to happen (for instance by
spreading manipulative information), proxy actors without any links to
the Russian state proceed to action on their own initiative and based on
what they think the officials might want' (Security Information Service,
2020, p. 9).

Through this move, [[the **spectre of 'Russian hybrid
war**]{.mark}**fare'** can [now encompass]{.mark} virtually
**[anything]{.mark}** that can be somehow **[interpreted as
matching]{.mark}** with the desires or **[interests]{.mark}** of the
Kremlin, **[without]{.mark} any need for [proving]{.mark} direct
[links]{.mark}**, as these are no longer considered necessary. The
**construction of 'a threat'** now includes even situations when 'a
foreign power does not engage in any direct action and keeps its
distance, while using various ways (PR, instigating statements,
propaganda etc.) to inspire individual persons to take
action']{.underline} (Security Information Service, 2020, p. 9). Put
differently, [Russian threat can be present even where there is no
direct Russian hand whatsoever. Literally any individual with views
somehow similar to those of the Russian state can be seen as part of it,
which makes the idea that security can ever be achieved virtually
**impossible**]{.underline}. Instead, this logic contributes to the
reproduction of an anxious society, defined by 'the constant presence of
the possibility of that threat, and with it, the sense that government
cannot fully protect the people and that danger resides in the everyday'
(Kinnvall & Mitzen, 2020, p. 247).

Third, this notion that the possibility that something 'Russian' may be
insidiously present deep within the Czech society then revives also the
old anxieties inherent in the 'modern' East/West geopolitical
imagination itself. Central Europeans\' self-positioning in East/West
geopolitics is highly ambivalent (Kuus, 2007; Todorova, 2009). On the
one hand, [**being** or becoming **part of 'the Western civilisation'**
is a source of **ontological security**. On the other hand, this
security is **never** quite **complete or permanent**]{.underline}. This
is because Central Europeans locate themselves at the very limit of the
West, as 'European edge-men' (Mälksoo, 2010, p. 5), whose membership in
the civilisation must constantly be proved as it can always be taken
away -- especially by the forces of the 'East'. The 'old shadow of
Yalta', the feeling that the region\'s 'freedom could yet again be
expendable in times of crisis' is constantly present (Mälksoo, 2010, p.
75). Put differently, East/West geopolitics equips the Czech
'pro-Western' security intellectuals with a 'mental map, where the
country is depicted as being on the "edge" of Europe and constantly
risking to "fall" into an abyss \[...\] traditionally characterised as
the "East"' (Cadier, 2019, p. 84). [While the **East/West geopolitical
imagination** can succeed in **spatialising the threat in the Russian
'other'**, the position it grants to **the self is always potentially
insecure**. Therefore, it is also East/West geopolitics itself that
**produces subjects** that are **constantly on alert**, facing the
constant 'possibility of loss of one\'s soul']{.underline} (Balaska,
2019, p. 8) [that defines the experience of anxiety]{.underline}.

[Such **fragile geopolitical self-positioning** further **[fuels the
search for new]{.mark}** and new sources of [**hybrid threats**, as
failing]{.mark} to uncover and face them may have **[existential]{.mark}
consequences**, especially given that **'Easternness' may have already
infiltrated and compromised the**]{.underline} Czech **[social
body]{.underline}**. [This notion of 'East within' links to
the]{.underline} above discussed unfathomability and [invisibility of HW
and manifests itself in multiple ways]{.underline}. For one
counterintelligence report, it takes the form of smuggled ideas and
narratives, presented 'in a way leading Czech citizens to believe they
are recipients of opinions held by fellow citizens not of Russian
propaganda' (Security Information Service, 2015, p. 11). Similarly, a
popular book on 'fake news' geopoliticises social attitudes en bloc by
identifying them along East/West axis, presenting the 'disappointed'
part of society as 'seeing a model in Russia, or perhaps China' (Gregor,
Mlejnková, & Zvolsi.info, 2018, p. 62). For others, the 'East within'
takes the form in the physical presence of 'Putin\'s agents' who
supposedly 'quite likely teach your children at universities, you meet
them for a coffee in your favourite café or work in normal jobs.'
(Kundra, 2016a, p. 88).

[The anxiety geopolitics of hybrid warfare is thus also about
[**creating** the]{.mark} normatively **highly disturbing** '**["red
under every bed" mentality]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Fridman, 2018, p. 3)
[[and]{.mark} applying 'the **[ethics of total
war]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[...\] [**[even to the smallest
skirmish]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Galeotti, 2019, p. 8). Therefore,
[**viewing security threats through the prism of hybrid warfare**
reproduces a highly anxious society and perpetuates the justification
for those 'intellectuals of statecraft']{.underline} (Ó Tuathail &
Agnew, 1992) [that would not hesitate to provide the sort of
geopolitical fixes]{.underline} that were [discussed in the previous
sections]{.underline}. Thereby, [**the discourse ends up reproducing
itself**, as the two faces of anxiety geopolitics not only disrupt, but
also dialectically reinforce one another: **geopolitical discourse
emerges to** repress anxiety and **provide ontological security**, yet
the **anxiety inherent in the discourse disrupts ontological security**
and, to come full circle, **creates the need for geopolitical
discourses**]{.underline}. [The result is a society **oscillating**
between its **desire to avoid anxiety** and the **repeated frustration**
thereof; an **affective pulsation** that has arguably been elevated to a
dominant mode of politics of (in)security in our present
time]{.underline} (Eklundh et al., 2017), of which hybrid warfare is a
prime example. As similar patterns of anxious over-reaction and
securitisation of broad areas of social life have been recognised by
authors writing about HW in different empirical contexts (Fridman, 2018;
Galeotti, 2019; Mälksoo, 2018; Ördén, 2019), we believe that the problem
with 'hybrid warfare' is of a more general nature and the relevance of
our analysis reaches beyond the Czech case.

4\. Conclusion

Introducing anxiety geopolitics as a conceptual linchpin between
disparate arguments from debates on critical geopolitics, ontological
security, and politics of anxiety, this article made two central
contributions. First, we have theorised the relationship between
geopolitics and anxiety, moving beyond the existing accounts above all
by pointing out the Janus-faced character of anxiety geopolitics, in
which anxiety is both repressed and reproduced. Second, using the case
of Czechia, we have argued that [hybrid warfare is a discourse that
constantly oscillates between repressing anxiety by geopoliticising the
source of danger in East/West terms, and subverting its own
constructions by presenting the threats as insidious, invisible, and
constantly shifting]{.underline}. Therefore, we contend that [the **HW
discourse** is structured in a way that **cannot achieve its purported
ambition to secure populations against 'hybrid threats'** and **instead
ends up producing more insecurity and anxiety**]{.underline}.

Our argument has clear normative implications that expand the existing
criticisms of HW by **[[putting the underlying civilisational
geopolitics in spotlight]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This should
[[help]{.mark} us [challenge the **tech**]{.mark}**nology[-centred
presentism]{.mark}** of the HW discourse, showing that **[many of
the]{.mark} ostensibly unprecedented [concerns are]{.mark} in fact
[reheated versions of narratives that date back decades]{.mark}** if not
centuries]{.underline}. More importantly, it enables us to point to the
presence of some of the highly problematic aspects of East/West
thinking, especially those that have been rightly criticised as
Orientalist, chauvinist or even racist (see e.g. Said, 1978; Todorova,
2009). [Realising the presence of **civilisational geopolitics** makes
it possible to ask whether certain [**portrayals of Russia** in **HW
debates**]{.mark} -- e.g. as barbaric, irrational, irredeemable -- may
not [represent]{.mark} **narcissistic [projections of the 'Western'
self, rather than credible threat assessments]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Chernobrov, 2019). Importantly, these are not scholastic matters of
concern just for ivory-tower peaceniks, as the proponents of HW
sometimes like to put it. Instead, these criticisms have clear
implications for security policy. As recognised even among NATO\'s own
analysts and officials (Caliskan & Liégeois, 2020; Rühle, 2019),
adopting the prism of HW and labelling Russia as an inherently
irrational enemy is detrimental to leading a productive debate on the
exact nature of the challenges that Putin\'s regime poses and
formulating appropriate and efficient strategies to respond to it. We
add to it by highlighting that the [**HW discourse** not only
'undermines strategic thinking']{.underline} (Caliskan & Liégeois,
2020), [but also **never actually manages to provide security** and
creates **highly concerning societal side-effects** (**perpetuation of
anxiety**, **proliferation of Orientalist images**)]{.underline}.

There are also important qualifications of our argument and avenues for
further research. First of all, we certainly do not claim that everyone
who ever spoke of 'hybrid threats' or 'hybrid warfare' would find
themselves in agreement with the examples used in our analysis, or be
instantly guilty of Orientalism. While the article focused on
overarching themes, there is certainly variation within the HW
discourse, not only in Czechia (Daniel & Eberle, 2021), but also in
Germany, UK or EU (Janičatová & Mlejnková, 2021; Monsees, 2020; Ördén,
2019). One intriguing possibility for further research is in showing the
variation in the way how geopolitical thought is invoked and anxiety
repressed and reproduced within the different versions of the HW
discourse. More generally, the theoretical argument should also be tried
and developed in other contexts.

Conceptualizing Russophobia

As Time magazine's person of the year in 2007, Vladimir Putin took the
opportunity to publicly address the negative views of Russia that exist
in the West, accusing "some" Americans of perpetuating false view of
Russians as "a little bit savage still or they just climbed down from
the trees, you know, and probably need to have their hair brushed or
their beards trimmed. And have the dirt washed out of their beards and
hair. That's the civilizing mission to be accomplished."14 Though
Putin's characterization may be somewhat extreme, Russophobia is well
documented in Russia, with politicians and analysts giving voice to this
phenomenon and its influences on policy makers. However, much less has
been written on Russophobia in English, and for Western audiences. But
[if we ever hope [to truly understand]{.mark} the many facets of the
[Russia]{.mark}-US relationship, [we must consider the ways]{.mark} in
which **[attitudes]{.mark}** toward Russia may be **[influenc]{.mark}ing
American [decision making]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Western characterizations of Putin are that he is an evil dictator,
abusing democracy, human rights and the rule of law, bent upon
re-drawing Europe's map, asserting Russia's influence and balancing
against American power at every turn]{.underline}. This characterization
of Russia's president is reflected in a 2009 Economist article in which
Putin was said to be looking for a war with the West, having "tantrums"
over controversial disagreements in the Middle East and Georgia,
"stumbling" into disputes with the West, and driven by "paranoia" and
"encirclement."15 While some of these criticisms of Putin may not be
entirely unreasonable, there is more to such critiques of Putin than
simply policy disagreement. [An inherent mistrust of Russia and of
Russians themselves, has colored western, and especially American, views
about post-Soviet Russia dating back to the Yeltsin
presidency]{.underline}.

DW Benn, writing about the misunderstanding of Russia in the West, notes
the presence of these ideas in the centuries old words of Lord
Palmerston himself, who once described a Russian colleague as "'civil
and courteous' but with 'all the cunning of a half-educated savage.'"16
According to Benn, a special disdain for the Russian people permeates
the discourse about Russia, and is easily hidden in the above criticisms
about contemporary Russian politics and foreign policy.17 George Kennan
once famously wrote that the political personality of the Soviet Union
was one that could not tolerate rivals, and was too "insensitive,"
"fierce" and "jealous" to share power. The Soviets were absorbed with
securing absolute power consistent with an ideology that instructs them
to believe that the outside world is hostile and must be resisted.18 One
does not have to look very hard to find these same sentiments about
contemporary Russian leaders.

Andrei [Tsygankov accurately identifies]{.underline} anti-Russianism, or
[**[Russophobia]{.mark}**, in American decision making]{.underline},
defined as "a fear of Russia's political system on the grounds that it
is incompatible with the interests and values of the West in general and
the United States in particular. [This fear [finds expression in]{.mark}
various forms of [criticism]{.mark} of Russia [that are **unbalanced**
and **distorted**. **No matter which**]{.mark} **independent [actions
Moscow may pursue]{.mark}**[, they are]{.mark} sure to be perceived...
as reflecting Russia's [expansionist]{.mark} interests]{.underline}, not
as a legitimate pursuit of national interests." 19 Russophobia
transcends ideological and partisan lines, as both neo-conservative and
liberal minded groups demonize Russia in fairly equal measure. These
attitudes are more than simply a cultural animosity toward Russians;
rather, they reflect "a very real fear of Russia's political influence"
that finds expression in a distorted critique of Russia and its
politics.20 [This [animosity results in a]{.mark} **persistent [need to
contain]{.mark}** Russia's influence, [even in]{.mark} times of relative
[peace]{.mark} and cooperation between the two nations]{.underline}.
This is [evidenced by the impulse to expand NATO]{.underline} just a few
short years after the end of the Cold War and before the reversal of
early expectations for Russia's democratic consolidation. This will be
discussed later in the paper.

For Tsygankov, [Russia is viewed as an expansionist state]{.underline}
that refuses to abide by "acceptable rules of international behavior,"
owing either to its political culture or its questionable leadership;
either way, it must be "contained or fundamentally transformed."21
[Russophobia is [informed by a **misinterpretation** of]{.mark} Russia's
[history]{.mark}, one [in which Russia has been **forced to respond**
to]{.mark} the actions of [the West, **rather than**]{.mark} represent
[some]{.mark} sort of [**ingrained** need to]{.mark} conquer and
[dominate]{.mark}]{.underline}.22 Russia is viewed as an autocratic
empire that perpetually oppresses nationalities, denies its citizens
basic rights, "concentrates economic and military resources in the hands
of the state," and doggedly pursues its inherent and illegitimate
expansionist national interests.23 This last point bears re-stating:
Russia is not accorded the courtesy of being seen to possess legitimate
national interests, owing to the above assumptions about its nature and
motivations. Tsygankov notes that, "[even during the 1990s, when Russia
looked]{.underline} more [like a failing state]{.underline} than one
capable of projecting power, some members of [the American political
class were worried about the]{.underline} future [revival
of]{.underline} the Eurasian giant as [a revisionist
power]{.underline}."24 He attributes the rampant triumphalism in the US
at the end of the Cold War to this fear of Russia, noting it reached its
zenith in the mid-1990s.25 In fact, it was actually the Clinton
administration that "entrenched the rhetoric of victorious thinking by
drawing the analogy between Russia and the defeat of Germany and Japan
in World War II."26 This triumphalism implied something inherently
superior, and therefore inferior, about the US and Russia, respectively.

Tsygankov is quick to label American Russophobia as a political
phenomenon rather than a cultural phenomenon, leaving open the
possibility for its willful reversal.27 While it may be the case that
Russophobia's presence in American foreign policy making may not be a
fait accompli, [its presence in the American discourse may reflect more
of a cultural presence of anti-Russianism that is
**self-reinforcing**]{.underline}. In fact, Tsygankov himself notes that
public opinion followed elite opinion and policy,28 which testifies to
its presence in the popular discourse. Tsygankov claims that [the
infusion of Russophobia into elite and popular attitudes about Russia is
the result of a willful construction of an **[anti-Russian
lobby]{.mark}** in order to [advance a particular]{.mark} foreign policy
[agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}. "The Lobby," is [[a **deliberate cabal
of**]{.mark} **anti-Russian military [hawks]{.mark}**, or those who
presume American geopolitical hegemony can best be achieved by the
military defeat of Russia]{.underline}, as well as those who assertively
presume the hegemony of so-called liberal values of democracy, rule of
law and human rights.29 This Lobby allegedly dates back to the early
20th Century, its views solidified by the Cold War, to which members of
Congress and policy makers in the White House have been sympathetic.30
While Tsygankov acknowledges that some of the Lobby's success could be
attributed to the absence of a pro-Russia lobby in the US,31 his
attention is trained on the Lobby's political goal of fostering
anti-Russian sentiment in the West in support of a "global power
struggle" against a potential "resurgent" Russia, [[rife
with]{.underline}]{.mark} what Zbigniew Brzezinski once labeled
**[["neo-colonial thinkers."]{.underline}]{.mark}**32

Tsygankov seeks to explain [the construction and persistence of an
anti-Russian lobby]{.underline} that [is purposefully distorting
Russia's role in the world]{.underline}, its history and its interests
to advance an anti-Russia agenda; however, this is not the precise case
made herein. Tsygankov's premise is not fundamentally rejected here, but
it is not fully embraced either. There does seem to be a culture of
anti-Russianism present in Washington that has influenced foreign policy
elites, but it may not necessarily be the result of an intentional drive
to keep Russia down. What this paper shares with Tsygankov is the
conviction that Russophobia exists, has a significant influence on
American foreign policy concerning Russia, and therefore must be better
identified and understood. The goal here is not to reveal malevolence
toward Russia, but rather to name this Russophobia, discuss its genesis,
and connect it with foreign policy outcomes in the hope of illuminating
what remains a significant impediment to a more constructive Russia-US
relationship.

In his writing on Russophobia, Anatol Lieven suggests that
[anti-Russianism is [derived]{.mark} in part [from the **myth of
America's**]{.mark} **own [exceptionalism]{.mark}**. This mythology sees
the US standing taller than other nations, able to make objective
observations about other states' motives, and thereby construct
appropriate policy in response]{.underline}. Lieven warns of the dangers
of [such assumptions]{.underline}, because they [[render US]{.mark}
policy makers ["**incapable of understanding**]{.mark} the
[opposition]{.mark} of other nations" to its own
policies]{.underline}.33 Lieven takes on NATO expansion directly, noting
that, among the many reasons Russia opposes it, is the US' failure to
appreciate what it means for Russia. US policy makers have been
genuinely puzzled by Russia's failure to perceive its enlargement as
benign, which is due in part to the American rhetoric that exists
alongside the policy decision itself. It is not only the physical
expansion of NATO that is problematic, but the corresponding failure to
bother understanding Russia's interests. This unwillingness to
understand Russia, combined with the embrace of longstanding and outworn
stereotypes about Russia, assumptions about the pattern of history in
Russia, as well [as [a **Cold War "hangover"**]{.mark}]{.underline} of
sorts, [which [cannot shake]{.mark} the image of
**[Russia-as-threat]{.mark}**,]{.underline} all [contribute to
define]{.underline} Russophobia and [the discourse within which American
foreign policy is made]{.underline}.

Lieven speculates that the intellectual basis for this Russophobia may
stem from 19th Century British propaganda regarding Russian expansionism
and its inherent wickedness. Lieven notes that this demonization of
other peoples, sometimes taking on a racist tone, has long been present
within Western, and American, foreign policy making.34 Moreover, there
is a tendency to assume that what was once assumed about a nation and
its peoples shall forever be true about them, even in the absence of
supporting evidence. This sort of historical determinism denies a
nuanced appreciation for cultural evolution and very much denies the
potential for American leaders to view post-Soviet Russia's
disappointing struggles with democracy for what they are. Instead, they
have been viewed against the backdrop of Russia's Tsarist and Communist
experiences and are therefore "wicked."35 This is evidenced by Henry
Kissinger's 2000 remark that Russian imperialism has continued for
centuries, characterized by subjugation of its neighbours and "overawing
those not under its direct control" and in Zbigniew Brzezinski's
assigning of blame for Stalinist-era policies to present day Russians.36
[For Lieven, [to view]{.mark} past [conduct as]{.mark} less a product of
history and more [a product of]{.mark} culture or ["national
DNA"]{.mark} of sorts, [comes **perilously close to racism**]{.mark}.
There is a certain **essentialism** in the American discourse on Russia
that equates these acts with "Russianness."]{.underline} Perhaps, as
Tsygankov suggests, [[**demonizing** Russia]{.mark} continued to [help
**justify US strategy**]{.mark} toward the USSR in the Cold
War.]{.underline} For Lieven, [[this **legitimized**]{.mark} **the
[military buildup]{.mark}**, the **containment**, the worldview and
actions that stemmed from the need to balance Soviet
power]{.underline}.37 Yet, as Lieven importantly notes, even those who
demonize Russia for its past seem to have little problem embracing
Communist China,38 so perhaps it is not communism in Russia's past the
Western leaders fear, but rather something cultural, something innately
"Russian."

Lieven concurs about [the [self-reinforcing]{.mark} nature of
Russophobia, [noting]{.mark} the [US' **"need for
enemies"**]{.mark}]{.underline}39 [[as]{.mark} an [instrumental]{.mark}
component [of its]{.mark} **own [narrative]{.mark} of
exceptionalism**]{.underline}. Perhaps [**[the result of viewing Russia
as the enemy]{.mark}** for so long **[is]{.mark}** the reason **[it has
become one]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Russophobia has enabled the judging
of Russia "by utterly different standards than those applied to other
countries."40 Tsygankov and Lieven are correct to suggest a linkage
between Russophobia and America's own mythologies about its place in the
world. America's destiny is to be a cultural hegemon atop the global
hierarchy of nations. [The perception of [American superiority]{.mark}
seems to **[require an "other"]{.mark}** to assume a position of
inferiority]{.underline}. Russia has long represented a new cultural
frontier and a divergent history, one that was assumed to be far less
"exceptional" than the American experience. [Challenges to the
presumption of American hegemony have often been met with not simply
disagreement, but a **de-legitimizing of the very existence of the
'other.'**]{.underline} Russia is not immune from ideas of
exceptionalism and the two nations have perpetuated a soft rivalry that
possesses "nationalist phobias"41 that can be mutually reinforcing.

Gertan Dijkink acknowledges that this "gross distinction between East
and West as opposite cultures" is part of the US discourse on Russia.42
For Dijkink, this does not have to be addressed directly, or be part of
a public discussion, because [it has become
**"naturalized,"**]{.underline} or considered to be common sense. He
notes that experience and [[discourse create an **imaginative
geography**]{.mark} of the outside world, which contributes to [the
**construction** of visions]{.mark} of the world]{.underline}."43
Dijkink notes that, after all, ["American foreign policy aims to
perpetuate, serve and affirm the American way of life,"]{.underline}44
[thus helping to explain why Russia's alternative to "the American way,"
presents a challenge]{.underline}. Georg [Lofflman confirms the impact
of [mythology]{.mark} on discourse and the **influence** on foreign
policy outcomes]{.underline}.45 [**Myths [shape identity]{.mark}**,
become themselves part of identity, [and **influence
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is reasonable to suggest that
[American exceptionalism influences Russophobia]{.underline}. If the US
is unique, its values superior, and therefore its preeminence in the
international system assumed, and if Russia fundamentally challenges
these values -- America's very identity -- in some way, then fear of
what Russia represents may be a consequence. Putin himself famously
warned Americans in 2013 of the dangers of seeing themselves as
exceptional.46

Richard Sakwa notes the difficult time US leaders have had accepting
Russia as an equal.47 Russia did not see itself as a defeated power
after the Cold War and conducted itself as such, a view in opposition to
the prevailing Washington narrative. Sakwa notes that Russia as a
democratic state was no less revisionist than Russia as a communist
state and that this was threatening to the existing world order that
presumed the hegemony of western liberal ideas.48 [Even though Russian
foreign policy was **actually fairly unthreatening**, and could even be
characterized as **collaborative** for many years, it was not
universally viewed this way because of the geopolitical threat it was
perceived to represent]{.underline}.49 Sakwa also claims that some of
the anti-Russianism has a strong basis in history, as Russia has never
really [been]{.underline} considered to be a part of Europe. Its very
presence has motivated European integration; post WWII European identity
was constructed on the basis of Russian exclusion, a reality that was
confirmed by decades of the Cold War. That the fear of Russia and the
exclusionary attitude toward Russia persist, driven largely by the
United States and the derivative suspicion of Russia from the Cold War
period, is problematic but not surprising.50

Russophobia in Western discourse has been written about, by Russians
themselves - poets and writers - for nearly two centuries.51 Some have
suggested that Russian fears of American Russophobia fuel a siege
mentality present within Moscow since the end of the Cold War.
Russophobia has had an impact; it has influenced the manner in which
Russia approaches its own relations with the West. Valentina Feklyunina
confirms that [the assumption of American [Russophobia]{.mark} by
Russians themselves has **[shaped Russia's self
perception]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and more importantly it has shaped
Russia's expectations for how foreign nations will engage with them.52
[Russian [leaders anticipate anti-Russianism]{.mark} in their dealings
with the West, [which]{.mark} **shapes and [perpetuate]{.mark} an ["us
vs. them" discourse]{.mark}** among Russian decision makers
[that]{.mark} may be [reinforc]{.mark}ing [the narrative of fear]{.mark}
in Washington]{.underline}.

Russophobia ought not be confused with criticism of Russia. Heikki
Luostarinen cautions that Finland, for example, no longer exhibits
Russophobia, but that it remains free to offer social and political
criticism.53 Russophobia is more than a disagreement or even competing
values; in fact, during the Cold War, Russophobia took on what
Luostarinen identifies as racist tones reflected in movies about the
evils of the Soviet empire.54 The USSR was often cast not simply as the
enemy, but as an evil villain, which justified its complete evisceration
and for which no action taken toward this goal could be considered
illegitimate. This demonization of the enemy may have parallels with the
post 9/11 discourse about terrorist groups such as Al Qaeda and the
Islamic State (IS). During the Cold War, hostilities with the Soviet
Union gave way to "fear, moral disgust and ignorance," which were
coupled with a lack of knowledge about the Soviet Union. Luostarinen
explains that [this **[enemy imaging]{.mark}**]{.underline} involves the
belief, by a cultural or political group and even a nation state itself,
that one's very security and fundamental values are purposefully and
meaningfully threatened by the other.55 This enemy [becomes essential to
**identity construction** and [may]{.mark} even [serve some **collective
psychological need**]{.mark} to perceive a threat [for which a **harsh
response** is justified]{.mark}]{.underline}. Externalizing a common
threat can be essential to legitimizing a collective identity and
historical experience.56 [This **"us vs. them" narrative** can feed a
**powerful [nationalism]{.mark}**, which can provide a context for
behaviors that might otherwise be difficult to legitimize.]{.underline}
This enemy construction can become ingrained as mythology among members
of a society. The "enemy image may strengthen integration within a given
group and moderate internal conflicts; [it [may]{.mark} help to **[bring
the rank and file behind]{.mark} the group [leaders]{.mark}**; it may be
used [**(scapegoat)** to **explain**]{.mark} **any [injustices]{.mark}**
within the group]{.underline}."57 Luostarinen is careful to note that
the construction of an enemy image does not mean that the so-called
enemy itself is not guilty of actions that contribute to its
demonization. The construction of an enemy image of Russia stems largely
from the very real fact that, for centuries, Russia has stood for much
of what Western values opposed: "autocracy, national repression, and
conservatism" and later "radicalism and social revolution."58 Fear of
Russian aggression has been in place since the 16th Century, blossoming
alongside the growth of Russian power.59 But [this **[fear]{.mark}** was
[coupled with the **racist view** of Russians as]{.mark} an
[inferior]{.mark}, inherently violent race that could not be trusted,
thereby necessitating the conclusion that peaceful coexistence could not
be countenanced; mistrust of the Russian leadership [transformed
into]{.mark} a **[cultural loathing]{.mark}** of Russians
themselves]{.underline}.60 John Gleason describes as deep seated fear or
dislike of Russia, which is the result of misunderstanding of Russian
history and culture, rooted in "competitive imperial ambitions."61
Gleason notes that it may be a natural inclination to fear that which we
know the least,62 which could help to explain the presence of
Russophobia in earlier periods when connection with cultures across the
globe was a rare occurrence. It does far less to explain the persistence
of Russophobia in a time in which, notwithstanding the warnings of
Samuel Huntington and others for whom cultural difference is a basis for
conflict,63 contemporary access to a diversity of cultures can prompt
cultural awareness, acceptance, and even fusion. This does not appear to
be the case with American views of Russia, which remain imbued with an
air of repugnance in which even minor differences take on elevated
significance.

This lingering hostility toward Russia -- [Russophobia - has fostered an
environment in which **cooperation is difficult** and missed
opportunities abound. [As a consequence of]{.mark} the [perpetual
misinterpretation]{.mark} of Russia, US [leaders **miss key
opportunities** for]{.mark} finding [compatibility]{.mark} with Russia,
particularly in key matters of security such as fighting terrorism,
dealing with weapons proliferation, illegal drugs, energy security and
working together to address instability in strategic and volatile
regions]{.underline}64 [[and informs]{.mark} the pursuit of a foreign
[policy]{.mark} agenda [that **needlessly antagonizes**]{.mark} Russia
[in]{.mark} an already uncertain international system. Moreover, the
**[expansion of NATO]{.mark}** eastward is evidence for some that the US
continues to fight the Cold War and has perpetuated in response an
extant anti-Americanism in Russia that will continue to make it
difficult for the US to pursue its interests]{.underline}.

Popularity of the 'New Terrorism' Discourse,
http://www.e-ir.info/2012/06/22/the-popularity-of-the-new-terrorism-discourse/

The opening sentence of a textbook on terrorism states, "[Terrorism has
been a]{.underline} dark [feature of human behavior since the dawn
of]{.underline} recorded [history]{.underline}" (Martin, 2010, 3). If
this is the case, what makes the 'new terrorism' different from the old?
[According to]{.underline} the mainstream [orthodoxy]{.underline} on
terrorism, the [old terrorism was]{.underline} generally [characterized
by]{.underline}: left wing ideology; the use of [small scale,
conventional weapons]{.underline}; clearly [identifiable
organizations]{.underline} or movements with equally clear political and
social messages; specific selection of targets and "explicit grievances
championing specific classes or ethnonational groups" (Martin, 2010,
28). Also according to the orthodoxy, the shift to the new terrorism, on
the other hand, is thought to have emerged in the early 1990s (Jackson,
2011) and took root in mass consciousness with the September 11, 2001
terrorist attacks on the U.S. (Martin, 2010, 3). The [[new terrorism is
characterized by]{.underline}:]{.mark} "loose, cell-based networks with
minimal lines of command and control," "desired acquisition of
high-intensity weapons and [[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass
[d]{.mark}estruction]{.underline}" (Martin, 2010, 27), "motivated by
religious fanaticism rather than political ideology and it is aimed at
causing mass causality and maximum destruction" (Jackson, 2007,
179-180). However, these dichotomous definitions of the old and new
types of terrorism are not without problems. [The]{.underline}
[first]{.underline} major [problem is that]{.underline} [terrorism has
been characterized by the same]{.underline} fundamental [qualities
throughout history]{.underline}. Some of the superficial
characteristics, the means of implementation (e.g. the invention of the
Internet or dynamite) or the discourse (communism vs. Islam) may have
evolved, but the central components remain the same. [The]{.underline}
[second]{.underline} major problem [is that the [characterization of new
terrorism is]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best, [rooted in a]{.underline}
particular [political ideology, biased and inaccurate]{.underline}. At
worst, [it is [racist, promotes war]{.mark} mongering [and has
contributed to millions of deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}. As David
Rapoport states: Many contemporary studies begin ... by stating that
although terrorism has always been a feature of social existence, it
became 'significant' ... when it 'increased in frequency' and took on
'novel dimensions' as an international or transnational activity,
creating in the process a new 'mode of conflict' (1984, 658). Isabelle
Duyvesteyn points out that this would indicate evidence for the
emergence of a new type of terrorism, if it were not for the fact that
the article was written in 1984 and described a situation from the 1960s
(Duyvesteyn, 2004, 439). It seems that there have been many new phases
of terrorism over the years. So many so that the definition of 'new' has
been stretched significantly and applied relatively across decades.
Nevertheless, the idea that this terrorism, that which the War on Terror
(WoT) is directed against, is the most significant and unique form of
terrorism that has taken hold in the popular and political discourse.
Therefore, it is useful to address each of the so-called new
characteristics in turn. The first characteristic is the idea that new
terrorism is based on loosely organized cell-based networks as opposed
to the traditional terrorist groups, which were highly localized and
hierarchical in nature. An oft-cited example of a traditional terrorist
group is the Irish Republican Army (IRA), who operated under a military
structure and in a relatively (in contrast to the perceived
transnational operations of al-Qaeda) localized capacity. However, some
of the first modern terrorists were not highly organized groups but
small fragmented groups of anarchists. These groups were heeding the
call of revolutionary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin and other contemporary
anarchists to achieve anarchism, collectivism and atheism via violent
means (Morgan, 2001, 33). Despite the initial, self-described
"amorphous" nature of these groups, they were a key force in the Russian
Revolution (Maximoff, G.). Furthermore, leading anarchist philosophers
of the Russian Revolution argued that terrorists "should organize
themselves into small groups, or cells" (Martin, 2010, 217). These small
groups cropped up all around Russia and Europe in subsequent years and
formed an early form of a "loosely organized cell-based network" not
unlike modern day al Qaeda. Duyvesteyn further notes that both the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which was founded in 1964, and
Hezbollah, founded 1982, operate on a network structure with very little
central control over groups (2004, 444). The second problematic idea of
new terrorism is [that]{.underline} [contemporary]{.underline}
[terrorist groups aim to]{.underline} acquire and [use]{.underline}
weapons of mass destruction ([WMDs]{.underline}). This belief [is simply
not supported by empirical evidence]{.underline}. One of the key
problems with this theory is that [[WMDs are significantly more
difficult to obtain and utilize than most]{.mark} people
[understand]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Even if a]{.underline} terrorist
[group were to obtain a]{.underline} [biological WMD]{.underline},
"Biologist Matthew Meselson calculates that [it would take
a]{.underline} ton of nerve gas or [five tons of mustard
gas]{.underline} [to produce]{.underline} heavy
[causalities]{.underline} among unprotected people in an open area of
one square kilometer" (Mueller, 2005, 488). And that's only an example
of the problem with the implementation of WMDs, [[assuming they
are]{.mark} acquired, [transported and desirable ]{.mark}]{.underline}by
a terrorist group [[in the first place]{.underline}]{.mark}. Additional
problems, such as the fact that [[WMDs "are extremely difficult to
deploy]{.mark} and control]{.underline}" (Mueller, 2005, 488) and that
[making a]{.underline} [bomb]{.underline} "[is]{.underline} an
[extraordinarily difficult]{.underline} task" (Mueller, 2005, 489),
further diminish the risk. It is interesting to note that, [while
the]{.underline} potential [dangers of WMDs are]{.underline} much
[lauded]{.underline}, [the attacks of September 11th were low tech and
had been]{.underline} technologically [possible for more]{.underline}
[than 100 years.]{.underline} Mueller also states, "[although nuclear
weapons have been around]{.underline} for well [over half a century, no
state has ever given]{.underline} [another state]{.underline} ([much
less a terrorist]{.underline} group) [a nuclear weapon]{.underline} that
the recipient could use independently" (2005, 490). All of this talk
about the difficultly of acquiring and deploying WMDs (by non-state
agents), is not to diminish the question of what terrorists have to gain
by utilizing these weapons. [It is important to question whether it
would even further the aims of terrorists to use]{.underline}
[WMDs]{.underline}. The [evidence suggests otherwise.]{.underline} In
the "Politics of Fear" Jackson states, "[[Mass casualties]{.mark}
are]{.underline} most often [counterproductive to terrorist
aims]{.underline} -- [they [alienate]{.mark} their [supporters
and]{.mark} can [provoke harsh reprisals]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}from the authorities \[...\]" in addition, "\[...\]
[they]{.underline} would [undermine community support]{.underline},
[distort the]{.underline} terrorist's [political message, and invite
over-whelming retaliation"]{.underline} (2007, 196-197). [[Despite
popular rhetoric]{.mark} to the contrary, [terrorists are "rational
political actors]{.mark}]{.underline} and are [acutely aware
of]{.underline} [these dangers]{.underline}" (Jackson, 2007, 197).
Government appointed [studies on this issue have supported these
views]{.underline}. This leads us to the third problem with new
terrorism, which is the idea that we are facing a new era of terrorism
motivated by religious fanaticism rather than political ideology. As
stated previously, earlier, so-called traditional forms of terrorism are
associated with left wing, political ideology, whereas contemporary
terrorists are described as having "anti-modern goals of returning
society to an idealized version of the past and are therefore
necessarily anti-democratic, anti-progressive and, by implication,
irrational" (Gunning and Jackson, 3). Rapoport argues the idea that
religious terrorists are irrational, saying, "what seems to be
distinctive about modern \[religious\] terrorists, their belief that
terror can be organized rationally, represents or distorts a major theme
peculiar to our own culture \[...\]" (1984, 660). Conveniently for the
interests of the political elites, as we shall see later, the idea of
irrational fanaticism makes the notion of negotiation and listening to
the demands of the other impossible. In light of this, it is interesting
to note that the U.S. has, for decades, given billions of dollars in aid
to the State of Israel, which could be argued to be a fundamentalist,
religious organization that engages in the terrorization of a group of
people. Further, it is difficult to speak of The Troubles in Northern
Ireland without speaking of the religious conflict, yet it was never
assumed that the IRA was "absolutist, inflexible, unrealistic, lacking
in political pragmatism, and not amenable to negotiation" (Gunning and
Jackson, 4). Rapaport further reinforces the idea that religious
terrorism goes back centuries by saying, "Before the nineteenth century,
religion provided the only acceptable justifications for terror..."
(1984, 659). As we have seen here, problems with the discourse of new
terrorism include the fact that [these elements of terrorism are neither
new nor]{.underline} [are the popular beliefs of the discourse supported
by empirical evidence]{.underline}. The question remains, then, why is
the idea of new terrorism so popular? This question will be addressed
next. Political Investment in New Terrorism There are two main
categories that explain the popularity of new terrorism. The first
category is government and [[political investment in
the]{.underline}]{.mark} [propagation of [the idea]{.mark} that a
distinct]{.underline}, [historically]{.underline} [unknown type of
terrorism [exists]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[mainstream
discourse]{.underline}]{.mark} \[1\] [[reinforces]{.underline}]{.mark},
through statements by political elites, media, entertainment and every
other way imaginable, [[the culture of]{.mark} violence,
[militarism]{.mark} and feelings of fear]{.underline}. Through mass
media, cultural norms and the integration of neoliberal ideology into
society, [people are becoming increasingly]{.underline} [desensitized to
human rights issues]{.underline}, war, [social justice and social
welfare, not to mention apathetic to the political process]{.underline}
in general. [The discourse of the WoT is merely the contemporary
incarnation of this culture of fear and violence.]{.underline} In the
past, various threats have included American Indians, women, African
Americans, communists, HIV/AIDS and drugs, to name but a few (Campbell,
1992). It can be argued that there are four main political functions of
[[terrorism discourse]{.underline}]{.mark}. The first [[is]{.mark} as [a
distraction from]{.mark}]{.underline} other, [[more immediate]{.mark}
and domestic social [problems such as poverty]{.mark}, employment,
racial inequality, health [and the environment]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The second, more sinister function is to control dissent]{.underline}.
In looking at both of these issues Jackson states: [[There
are]{.underline}]{.mark} a number of clear [[political
advantages]{.mark} to be gained [from the creation of]{.mark} social
[anxiety ]{.mark}]{.underline}and moral panics. In the first place,
[[fear]{.underline}]{.mark} is a disciplining agent and [[can]{.mark}
be]{.underline} effectively [deployed to de-legitimise
dissent]{.underline}, [[mute criticism]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
constrain internal opponents. \[...\] Either way, [its primary function
is to ease the pressures of accountability for political
elites]{.underline}. [As instrument of elite rule, political fear
is]{.underline} in effect [a political project aimed at reifying
existing structures of power]{.underline}. (Politics of Fear, 2007,
185). Giroux further reinforces the idea that a [culture of
fear]{.underline} creates conformity and [deflects attention from
government accountability]{.underline} by saying, "the ongoing appeal to
jingoistic forms of patriotism divert the public from addressing a
number of pressing domestic and foreign issues; it also contributes to
the increasing suppression of dissent" (2003, 5). [[Having a problem
that is]{.underline}]{.mark} "[ubiquitous, [catastrophic, and]{.mark}
fairly [opaque]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Jackson, Politics of Fear, 2007,
185) [[is useful]{.mark} to political elites]{.underline}, [[because it
is]{.mark} nearly [impossible to address the efficacy of combating the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. At least, empirical evaluation can be, and
is, easily discouraged in academic circles through research funding
directives. Domestic problems such as the unemployment rate or health
care reform, on the other hand, are directly measurable and heavily
monitored by domestic sources. It is possible to account for the success
or failure of policies designed to address these types of problems and
the (re)election of politicians often depends heavily on success in
these areas. However, the public is neither involved on a participative
level nor, often, socially aware of what is happening in murkier and
unreachable areas like foreign policy. The third political investment in
maintaining the terrorism discourse has to do with economics. "At a
material level, [there are]{.underline} a great many [vested interests
in]{.underline} maintaining [the]{.underline} widespread [condition of
fear, not least for [the m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial
[c]{.mark}omplex]{.underline} [which]{.underline} [[benefits
directly]{.underline}]{.mark} [from]{.underline} increased [spending on
national security]{.underline}" (Jackson, Politics of Fear, 2007, 186).
This is true with all forms of crime and insecurity as all of them
factor into the greater security-industrial complex. Not only do these
industries employ millions of people and support their families, they
boost the economy. Barry Buzan talks of these the importance of these
issues to both the government and the public [in terms of a]{.underline}
'[threat-deficit']{.underline} -- meaning that [U.S. policy and society
is dependent on having an external threat]{.underline} (Buzan, 2007,
1101). [The fourth]{.underline} key [political interest in terrorism
discourse is [constructing]{.mark} a [national
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. This will be discussed more thoroughly in
the following section, however, it is important to acknowledge the role
the WoT (and previous threats) has had on constructing and reinforcing a
collective identity. Examples of this can be seen in the discourse and
the subsequent reaction to anyone daring to step outside the parameters
of the Bush Administration-established narrative in the days immediately
following the September 11th attacks. A number of journalists, teachers
and university professors lost their jobs for daring to speak out in
criticism of U.S. policy and actions following the attacks. In 2001,
Lynne Cheney attacked the then deputy chancellor of the New York City
Schools, Judith Rizzo, for saying "terrorist attacks demonstrated the
importance of teaching about Muslim cultures" (Giroux, 2003, 22).
According to Giroux, this form of [jingoistic patriotism]{.underline}
"[[becomes]{.mark} a euphemism for shutting down dissent, [eliminating
critical dialogue]{.mark}]{.underline}, and condemning critical
citizenship in the interest of conformity [and a dangerous departure
from what it means to uphold a viable democracy]{.underline}" (2003,
24). [The message is, we are not the other (Muslims),]{.underline}
patriotism equals agreement and compliance [and our identity is based on
the shared values of liberty and justice]{.underline}. According to
Carol Winkler, "Negative ideographs contribute to our collective
identity by branding behavior that is unacceptable ... American society
defines itself as much by its opposition to tyranny and slavery as it
does by a commitment to liberty" (Winkler, 2006, 12). Terrorism, and by
association in this case, Islam, functions as a negative ideograph of
American values. It thereby tells us what our values and our identity
are by telling us who the enemy is and who we are not. According to
Jackson, "\[...\] some have argued that [[Western identity is dependent
on the appropriation of a]{.mark} backward, illiberal, [violent Islamic
'other' against which the West can organize a collective
liberal]{.mark},]{.underline} [civilized '[self']{.mark}]{.underline}
[and consolidate its cultural and political norms"]{.underline}
(Jackson, Constructing Enemies, 2007, 420). Through this analysis we can
see there are four key ways in which the hegemonic system is invested in
propagating a culture of fear and violence and terrorism discourse. [Not
only is it key for political elites to support this system, [it
is]{.mark} also [crucial that there be an ever
renewing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[threat that is]{.mark} uniquely
[different]{.mark} from past threats]{.underline}. These [new threats
allow for the investment of]{.underline} significantly [more
resources]{.underline}, the continuation of the economy, the renewal of
a strong sense of cultural identity and the indoctrination and obedience
of new generations of society. This essay will now look at how
individual and collective psychology supports the popularity of the new
terrorism discourse. Psychology of the Masses The second category of
reasons why new terrorism discourse is popular can be called the
psychology of the masses. There are a number of factors that fall under
this category such as: the hyper-reality of the modern era; the culture
of fear; the carryover of historical archetypes and the infiltration of
neoliberal values into cultural norms. The topic of social and
individual psychology and how it relates to the propagation and
acceptance of hegemonic discourse is broad. It is also an important
aspect of critical terrorism studies and merits further exploration.
However, in this section will outline the basis for the popularity of
new terrorism discourse and discuss several ways in which this
popularity is manifested and reinforced in contemporary society.

More broadly, [**alternativity in [critical IR theory]{.mark}** [needs
to be rescued from **never-ending conceptual reifications**]{.mark},
which have ended up making **ontological assentation** about the world
become **[completely detached from the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
this regard, [there is a **growing realization in IR** that
"**critique** is a necessary but **secondary** task; the **priority** is
to **return to practical theory as quickly as possible**"]{.underline}
(Levine 2012, 69). [Recalibrating the purpose of alternativity in
critical theory [requires]{.mark} recalibrating knowledge production,
[**not only** to **unmask power relations** and]{.mark} the dynamics of
dominance and to **[create space]{.mark}** for a politics of resistance
[**but also** to **generate practical knowledge** for **political
action**]{.mark} that challenges, confronts, and disrupts existing power
relations [and **offer**]{.mark}**s [alternative solutions]{.mark}** for
reshuffling social relations on more emancipatory and inclusive
terms]{.underline} (see Duvall and Varadarajan 2003, 85; Murdie 2017;
Deiana and McDonagh 2018). A feature of critical peace and conflict
studies is [a **congruence** between the **emancipatory** and
**problem-solving** perspectives]{.underline}, which should be
predicated on the conciliation of knowledge, the expansion of
onto-politics of peace, and the pluralization of epistemological and
methodological approaches. The recent methodological work by J. Samuel
Barkin and Laura Sjoberg (2017) on interpretive quantification is a
promising move toward this much-needed pluralist fertilization within
critical theory. [In particular, [a **stronger linkage** between]{.mark}
criticality, [**alternativity**, and **practicality** could help
**critical security**]{.mark}]{.underline}, peace, and conflict
[theories to **offer alternatives** that would **maintain critical
impetus** while simultaneously **strengthening ties to practical and
societal problem-addressing solutions**]{.underline}. [**Genealogical
studies** would [**blend well** with]{.mark} a critical analysis of
conceptual and **[policy alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see
Milliken 1999). Statistical analysis with an emancipatory hypothesis
coupled with critical analysis [[would **contribute to subverting policy
practices** and]{.mark} would **normalize alternative knowledge** about
peace, justice, and emancipation]{.underline}.

[The recent **practice-turn in IR** offers new **bridges** between
scholars and practitioners, making it possible to [**translate critical
knowledge into practice** **without compromising**]{.mark} the
[**normativity** and **criticality**]{.mark} of scholarly
works]{.underline} (see Bigo 2011). A forum on pragmatism published in
this journal has implicitly highlighted the importance of alternativity
in [understanding global politics and generating impactful knowledge
beyond the existing epistemological and methodological
divides]{.underline} (see Hellmann 2009). Friedrichs and Kratochwil
(2009, 701) have argued for "the orientation of research toward the
generation of useful knowledge." [**Practicality is essential** for
**generating alternatives**]{.underline}. For instance, Jonna Nyman
(2016, 142) argues that "a pragmatic, practice-centred approach . . .
can help us gain practical knowledge of how security works and
understand the value of security better, as well as help us to suggest
alternative possibilities." Similarly, Navnita Chadha Behera (2016, 154)
argues: "theorizing in IR needs to step out of the rarefied atmosphere
of its academe, develop a healthy scepticism toward its canonical
frames, and open up to the possibilities of learning from everyday life
and experiences of people and their living traditions and practices."
Practicality shifts the focus from abstract criticality and normativity
to contextual critiques that account for everyday practices and
interactions. This would be essential for rescuing critique from
becoming a postempirical endeavor.

[[**Critical knowledge** that **engages with policy
alternatives**]{.mark} "is not only pragmatic, it [is]{.mark} also
**[politically enabling]{.mark}**: it [forces us **away from**]{.mark}
instrumental [**problem-solving perspectives** towards a **wider
framework of pragmatic thought** where **narrow instrumental goals** are
**overridden by**]{.mark} wider **[normative]{.mark}** and **political**
[concerns]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Kurki 2013, 260). [Such grounded
critiques are crucial in order to expand non-prescriptive alternativity
and exploring practical possibilities for social emancipation and
change]{.underline}. For Steve Smith (2002: 202), "[the **acid test**
for the **success** of alternative and **critical approaches** is the
extent to which they have led to **empirically grounded work** that
explores the range and variety of world politics]{.underline}." This
would also be [congruent with]{.underline} Daniel Levine\'s (2012, 30)
concept of sustainable critique, which [entails thinking in both
practical and critical terms at once so that "IR could create a
sustainably critical perspective on global politics that might then be
**turned back onto**, and made [to **inform**]{.mark}, ongoing **[policy
debates]{.mark}** and discourses]{.underline}." Behera (2016, 154)
further maintains that the "state-centric ontology of IR has effectively
ended up dehumanizing the discipline in a way so that normally it has
little to do with human relations, human needs, and the larger
imperatives of humanity." Generating practical alternatives would
therefore require endorsing situated knowledge as an epistemological and
methodological basis for any engagement with the real world. The work of
feminists such as Donna Haraway (1988, 584) on situated standpoints is
also relevant here because they offer "more adequate, sustained,
objective, transforming accounts of the world." Situated knowledge is,
mostly, nonrepresentational knowledge, in that it is not firmly mediated
through preexisting discourses. In this regard, promoting subjugated
knowledge discourses and practices could be central to rejuvenating the
emancipatory commitment of critical theory (see Doty 1996).

[Situated **alternatives could derive from emplaced and embodied
knowledge** and could have a more emancipatory character as they "bring
forth the importance of recognizing, valuing, and employing marginalized
voices by working from this perspective, as well as by **reshaping
research to include marginalized communities as part of knowledge
production**"]{.underline} (McHugh 2015, 62). For Robson and McCartan
(2016, 3), "real world research looks to examine personal experience,
social life and social systems, as well as related policies and
initiatives. It endeavours to understand the lived in reality of people
in society and its consequences." Milja Kurki\'s (2013, 245) recent
study of democracy promotion has approached alternativity from the
perspective of policy provocations, which focus "on not prioritising one
or another perspective, but rather on encouraging self-reflection by all
practitioners, which in turn is considered as a key condition of seeking
adequately pluralism-fostering reforms in concrete policy frameworks."
Kurki (2013, 248--51) further maintains that "[**instead of relying on
objective knowledge** and criteria, **policy process can and should be
attuned to the logic of interpretive, politicised and participatory
judgements**]{.underline}." Her study is an excellent example of
pragmatic congruence between criticality and alternativity, whereby
policy alternatives are not geared toward totally improving or enhancing
the current system but openly promote more pluralistic, reflexive, and
emancipatory policies for democratization and peacebuilding.

Moreover, for these new grounds of critical alternativity to be
introduced in practice, knowledge production should be decentered,
decolonized, and "de-methodolised" (see Lisle 2014). R. B. J. Walker
(2002, 265) has argued that "the key achievement of supposedly
alternative and critical literatures over the past two decades has been
to open up at least some possibility of asking questions about the
location and character of the political." As elaborated in this study,
knowledge production in peace and conflict studies is predominantly
based on Western epistemologies, which are shaped by specific cultures
of thought, self-perpetuated epistemological superiority, and codified
academic practices. Most of the international scholarship on
postconflict societies derives from an unrepresentative body of
knowledge, which tries to mediate, deviate, reinterpret, and,
consequently, construct a different social reality that is interpreted
through different measurements, reference points, and analytical
concepts (see Latour 2005). This has greatly limited the possibility for
proposing realizable alternatives. Due to these epistemological
anomalies, there are growing calls in scholarship to decolonize
knowledge from Eurocentric and Western dominance and instead to pursue
more pluralist and particularist modes of knowledge (Smith 2012). For
instance, Acharya and Buzan (2010, 2) have argued that [IR theory should
be "an open domain into which it is not unreasonable to expect
non-Westerners to make a contribution at least proportional to the
degree that they are involved in its practice]{.underline}." Similarly,
Andrew Hurrell (2016, 151) has proposed that "[the pathway to a global
IR will need to look beyond 'IR' and is likely to require new models for
organizing social science research and knowledge
production]{.underline}." Decolonized epistemologies of peace would
reverse the order of knowledge, placing the local first and then the
regional and international as spatial and ontological scales for
understanding peace processes (Visoka 2017). They would not operate in
isolation but would engage in shaping global IR knowledge. Therefore, a
genuine search for achievable alternatives should try to decolonize
peace knowledge from Western and Eurocentric frameworks, interrogate
decolonized knowledge and agencies, and explore the joint constitution
of international intervention and local resistance (see Smith 2012;
Memmi 2006). Local scholars often have rich knowledge, but the primary
usage of it is not for instrumental purposes or for transferring and
sharing with audiences of outsiders. Local knowledge is very much used
to respond to narrow practical and everyday interests and needs and, as
such, is embedded in the logic of generating sufficient knowledge to
respond to specific circumstances.

In the context of peacebuilding, as examined in this article, generating
alternatives from the ground up has the potential to bring about more
sustainable forms of peace and reconciliation for groups and societies
affected by violent conflict. [**Situated alternatives** for
emancipatory peace are [**more prone to avoiding co-optation** by
**positivist** and **problem-solving** **epistemic predators**,
resulting]{.mark} thus [in]{.mark} developing [pluriversal]{.mark}
political and peace [orders **beyond liberal peacebuilding**]{.mark} and
other Eurocentric impositions]{.underline}. [From this situated
perspective, emancipation could take the shape of "the transformation of
structures and relationships of vulnerability through localized
political action, aimed at the creation of spaces in people\'s lives so
that they are enabled to make decisions and act beyond mere
survival]{.underline}" (Basu and Nunes 2013, 69). Emancipatory
alternatives would not be universal in their applications because such
an attempt is not viable. [Rather the focus should be on searching for
practical emancipatory possibilities within a given context, time,
space, and place]{.underline} (see Fierke 2007, 24). In other words,
[critiques with an adequate dose of alternativity are **more likely to
generate globally understandable and locally impactful
knowledge**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, alternativity does not
necessarily have to be predicated on representative views of the
world---it can also be a by-product of performing hope and imagined
possibilities in global politics. Shapiro (2013, xiv) argues that
critical thinking helps to "create the conditions of possibility for
imaging alternative worlds." That said, as the purpose of critical
theory is emancipatory change, any alternative theoretical and empirical
observation in service of improving the human conditions should generate
a morally and practically acceptable standpoint. Because any attempt to
establish an alternative interpretation inevitably "empowers a
particular social and political standpoint" (Price and
**[Reus-Smit]{.underline}** 1998, 261). According to Ní Mhurchú and
Shindo (2016, 5), "critique can help us to develop different ways of
talking about, evaluating, doing and interrogating the changing nature
of politics, relations and experiences of the international in a
globalising world." Hence, critique is inevitably implicated in
world-making and, with a much clearer understanding of alternativity,
can steer the thrust for world-changing in a more emancipatory, just,
and inclusive direction.

Conclusion

[Emancipation is a central feature of critical IR debates, but scholars
often **fail to develop alternatives** or **solutions achieving
emancipation** in practice]{.underline}. This article has examined the
relationship between criticality and alternativity in IR in order to
shed light on some of the most contested issues of critical theory,
namely, the epistemological pathways for identifying the inconsistencies
and flaws in existing knowledge and practices and the extent to which
critical knowledge should generate alternative emancipatory
possibilities. The article has argued that [alternativity provides an
opportunity for critical scholars to **remain relevant without being
affiliated with positivist logics of inquiry**]{.underline}. In
unpacking the conceptual contours, the article first explored how
different branches of critical IR engage with the episteme of
alternativity. The analysis found that [although alternativity is often
affiliated with problem-solving epistemologies, it has played a major
role in shaping critical knowledge in IR]{.underline}. While this is
acknowledged and endorsed at the epistemological level by a branch of
critical scholars who engage in normative and reconstructive modes of
critique, other [scholars embedded in **deconstructive modes of
critique** have **disregarded the merits of alternativity in
IR**]{.underline}. The article has argued that, [**[contrary to what
is]{.mark} often [assumed]{.mark}, [alternativity is not incompatible
with deconstructive]{.mark}** or reconstructive **[critiques]{.mark}**
across different subdisciplines of IR. Yet **critical IR debates,**
which have now become the **new mainstream in IR**, have failed to
engage with the episteme of alternativity in a more empirical and
practical sense. They preach emancipation but **fail to develop tangible
emancipatory alternatives**]{.underline}.

[As a result, there is a growing realization that, without tangible
alternativity, critical theory risks losing its normative impetus and
its ethical and emancipatory commitment, potentially becoming a
post-epistemological vocation without politics]{.underline}. [Critical
knowledge **[without]{.mark}** a dose of **[alternativity]{.mark}** may
examine the causes and consequences of subject matters but could [**fall
short** of **reaching out** to the **wider policy community**]{.mark}
and the **affected subjects** where power relations reside, thus
[**missing the opportunity** to **transform**]{.mark} the
[**structural**, **discursive**, and **performative** practices that
reproduce **violence**]{.mark}, **inequality**, and i**njustice** on
human and nonhuman ecology]{.underline}. To bridge this epistemological
gap, the analysis in the second part of this article examined how
alternativity features in peace and conflict studies, a disciplinary
field known for adding normative, empirical, and practical substance to
critical IR debates. The analysis offered a conceptual scoping of three
modes of critique and alternativity in peace and conflict studies. The
three modes of critique showed that a conjunction between criticality
and alternativity is possible and that it is necessary to renew the
practical and emancipatory potential of critical theory in IR. The three
modes of alternativity in peace and conflict studies expose a spectrum
of different critiques, ranging from those perspectives that disengage
completely from conceptual and empirical alternatives, to more pragmatic
and prescriptive approaches.

Critique-without-alternative represents one strand, which tends to avoid
offering normative and practical alternatives to their critical
reflections aimed at maintaining the conservative and radical impetus of
critical theory and dissociating from problem-solving and
policy-relevant methods of inquiry. This mode of critique is committed
to revealing the weaknesses of peacebuilding interventions but refuses
to offer any emancipatory and practical alternative on how to build
sustainable peace after violent conflict. [If the end goal of critical
perspectives is achieving emancipation, then critique should not only be
directed toward problematizing dominant discourses, practices, and
policies but also needs to envisage political and practical alternatives
rooted in ideational and material elements. In turn, the **lack of an
explicit emancipatory agenda** [**limits** their **social and political
impact** and]{.mark} unintentionally **[validates the existing
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In response to this challenge, a new mode
of critique has emerged, namely, critique-as-alternative, which
exemplifies the optimal approach. Proponents of critique-as-alternative
have remained committee to critical analysis, but most importantly, they
have taken up the challenge of offering emancipatory knowledge that has
practical relevance for vulnerable societies in global politics. Their
main flaw, however, has been their inability to elaborate sufficiently
their practical and emancipatory alternatives---a flaw that has opened
up space for epistemic contestation and policy co-optation. Finally, the
third mode of critique---critique-with-alternative---which is embedded
in a positivist, problem-solving, and policy-driven logic of inquiry,
offers alternatives that seek either to verify existing knowledge and
the existing interventionary order or to reject other critical
alternatives.

Looking at different modes of critique through the lens of alternativity
in IR\'s subdiscipline of peace and conflict studies has provided
interesting insights on the promise and limits of critical IR in shaping
global politics. The analysis found that existing modes of critique have
failed to develop elaborative emancipatory alternatives at both the
conceptual and the practical levels. To infuse critique-with-alternative
with emancipatory elements, expand the epistemological scope of
critique-without-alternative, and operationalize further the practical
solutions offered by this mode of critique, substantial changes are
needed. This article has suggested [exploring postparadigmatic
approaches of inquiry]{.underline} in order to [avoid existing
epistemological entrapments and limitations, reclaiming the practical
relevance of critical theory through pragmatic, reflexive, and situated
alternatives---across the conceptual, normative, and empirical
spectrums---and promoting decolonized, bottom-up methods of knowledge
production]{.underline}. The existing modes of [critique require
pursuing more **nonconflictual** and **postparadigmatic**
**epistemologies**, embracing situated knowledge and reclaiming and
expanding its **practical relevance**, breaking away from
**geo-epistemological hierarchies**, and opening up to **post-Western
IR**]{.underline}. To conclude, [**promoting alternativity** has the
potential to **rejuvenate critical scholarship** embedded in the ethos
of impactful engagement with the world **without being co-opted by the
policy world**]{.underline}. [The next challenge for scholars should not
be whether alternativity and criticality are congruent but how
emancipatory alternatives can renew the social and political purpose of
critical theory and **make an impact in the real world**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

IR theory has undoubtedly been 'in a state of disarray' for several
decades now,96 and the approach espoused above does not necessarily seek
to turn things around. One thing that [praxeological
deconstructionism]{.underline}, as a 'third way', [seeks to]{.underline}
do, however, is to [show that efforts at [theory building and social
transformation are **complementary**]{.mark} in most cases; hence
[researchers should]{.mark} maintain the liberty to **[pick and choose
from various perspectives to inform their particular case
studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many theoretical approaches have had
similar ambitions but I find that IR is still taking baby-steps towards
what I have envisioned as a 'third way', which grows from the continuous
frustration with the problem-solving/critical theory binary in the
field. I insist on [intellectual diversity and theoretical
pluralism]{.underline} but at the same time diversity and pluralism
should be [underpinned by]{.underline} the need for [genuine
cross-communication and multi-disciplinarity]{.underline}. This [escapes
the 'paradigmatic paramountcy' of either rationalist or critical
approaches,]{.underline}97 [thereby improving dialogue and furthering
disciplinary growth]{.underline}.

In sum, the case this paper has made is that, without the careful
synthesis of the multiplicity of approaches and perspectives that best
capture the field as 'international', thereby incorporating alternative
and marginalised perspectives, the future of IR as a field that
contributes meaningfully to addressing the problems of the day will
remain untapped. So far, I have argued that [[deconstruction **alone**
is not enough. One has to]{.mark} have a conversation after
deconstruction and then [try to reconstruct in both theoretical and
pragmatic ways]{.mark}, bearing in mind the dangers of reconstruction.
[This would allow research not **only** to understand the world **but
also to change it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some theorists who are set in
their ways will ask: is synthesis of the IR field possible? Is it even
desirable? I would say 'yes' to both questions. The need for a synthetic
'third way' has arisen; one that is neither essentialised as
problem-solving nor critical, but which embraces some relevant
assumptions of both. More importantly, nevertheless, [[IR
theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} (particularly of the 'post' tradition)
[[should **get out of their ivory tower** to espouse theories that are
**self-critical**, **meaningful** and **continually relevant**
to]{.mark} the [human experiences]{.mark} of the agents/subjects they
study. **[This is the purpose of theory!]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### [Our]{.underline} framework solves their offense, but [their]{.underline} framework links to ours.

The second premise derives from some critical scholars' refusal to offer
specific alternatives. Richard Ashley (as well as [many post-structural,
postcolonial, and post-development scholars]{.underline}), for instance,
will [argue that it is not the goal of critical theory to provide
alternatives, as such an endeavour defeats the self-reflexivity that
undergirds the theory. But this is problematic because, while these
theories reveal the agency in the theory, there is no clarity of purpose
in terms of 'actionable' leeway for the agent]{.underline}. Also,
instead of glorifying realism, for instance as offering a 'timeless
wisdom',66 [the followers in this camp should be more reflexive so as to
overcome the inert determinism and parochialism that underpin their
theorising]{.underline}. Closely related to the second justification is
the argument that [[the purpose]{.mark} of both theoretical and
empirical analyses [is not only to understand the world **but**]{.mark}
**also [to change it]{.mark}**. This [change is **not possible**
if]{.mark} critical [theorists engage **solely in inward-looking
critiques**]{.mark} **of existing theories** [without providing **a
programmatic understanding of what their perspectives entail** or **how
the existing condition can improve**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[end page
67\] Additionally, as the need for theoretical pluralism becomes more
apparent, PD assists in making sure the notion of 'pluralism' moves from
being a buzzword to an actual practice. Essentially most IR theories
have four main themes in common: power, order, structure and
agency---although the emphasis placed on each of these elements differs
from theory to theory. Praxeologically oriented deconstruction helps to
elucidate these four components without taking any aspect of them for
granted. The argument here recognises the ontological and
epistemological difficulties one falls into when thinking of a 'third
way'---the difficulty of having so many established scholars and
theorists disagree with the approach on many grounds, even including
grounds of originality and usefulness. But the point is that, while we
emphasise, for instance, what Ashley calls the 'four p's'---process,
practice, power and politics67---we need to explore the structure and
utility of the state in contemporary world politics---and by so doing
unveil the axes of domination in existing structures. This is therefore
an approach which symbolises the mutually constitutive synergies between
knowledge/theory and praxis/practice, as explained below, rather than
one that seeks to revolutionise the entire field of study by turning it
upside down.

This approach does not simply seek to reimagine 'deconstruction' but
rather attempts to show that [[deconstruction, **without
praxis**,]{.mark} ends at a point which [leaves the individual]{.mark}
subject [unable to ascertain]{.mark} what [options of social
transformation]{.mark} are [available]{.mark}]{.underline}.68 The main
contention in recent times has been between those who call themselves
'rationalists' and the 'constructivists', although neither possesses a
concise set of theoretical and methodological assumptions that explain
the entirety of IR. [As the socio-political phenomena IR addresses are
often subjective and context-specific, there is no 'scientific truth' to
be had which will transcend space and time]{.underline}. The ontology of
PD, as evident from Figure 1, is that there is no one world or 'truth'
out there, if any, and in the same manner there is no single way of
knowing or standard by which 'good' knowledge is measured. In this case
'truth is always contingent, always a matter for debate and always
partial', meaning that 'truth is not "out there", waiting to be
discovered'.69 Rather, there are multiple understandings which reside in
\[end page 68\] different sites---times and spaces. [[A 'third way'
is]{.mark} thus [crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially [[for]{.mark}
people who are concerned with [**both** discursive interpretations
**and** real (emancipatory) alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}.70 [It is
only in this way that the discipline can become transformative or
pro-change while taking into cognisance the fact that change can occur
from both within and outside established arenas of power]{.underline}.
PD also shows that [[there is no point in '**throwing the baby out with
the bathwater**']{.mark}; although the water is dirty, the baby can be
saved lest the purpose of bathing the baby itself becomes
self-defeating]{.underline}. This speaks to the freedom and flexibility
this approach gives to the researcher in choosing from multiple
perspectives.71

#### The [most important question]{.underline} is: How can we [actually make the world]{.underline} a better place? Only [our framework]{.underline} asks it.

Contours of praxeological deconstructionism: research programme54

[It remains problematic to think along the lines of the strict
distinction]{.underline} Robert Cox makes [between
problem-solving]{.underline} or rationalist theories [and
critical]{.underline} or interpretivist [theories]{.underline} of IR
[because]{.underline} in essence **[['\[all\] theory is political and
\[all\] political action is theory-laden']{.underline}]{.mark}**.55 [The
rigidity that comes with]{.underline} the [two main]{.underline}
approaches, or ['theoretical churches']{.underline}, [does
no]{.underline} specific [good]{.underline} to the field in general.
[While there is dignity in difference, there is hope in some degree of
commonality]{.underline}. The approach being promoted here is more
congenial to critical theory thanks to its reflexivity but it also
embraces mixed methods. [The quest is to problematise [the]{.mark}
'problem-solving/critical theory' [binary]{.mark}]{.underline} that we
have been presented with in the field of IR, [based on the argument that
it [is arbitrary and]{.mark} often [a misrepresentation of]{.mark} the
many [theories]{.mark} and research traditions [that]{.mark} often
attempt to [exhibit **both**]{.mark} characteristics]{.underline}. In
some cases what is considered to be solving a problem actually solves
nothing, since the theory can be so removed from the world 'out there'
that it attempts to describe, revealing an overpowering 'practicality
deficit' in the theory's core assumptions.56

My proposition for a 'third way' is based on these premises: First,
[historically some [critical]{.mark} theorists [have borrowed from
problem-solving]{.mark} theorists, [and vice]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end
page 66\] [[versa]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, a feminist
theorist like Ann Tickner has attempted to reformulate realism.57 While
there are many variants of feminism, some of them appear to begin their
theorising with an acknowledgement of traditional realists such as Hans
Morgenthau.58 The point here is that some critical theories seem to have
built upon some of the assumptions of problem-solving theories, although
others deconstruct and reject them outright. After all, Cynthia Enloe
has argued that a book about international politics should leave one
with a sense that 'I can do something', a more instrumental and
affirmative orientation that most IR books lack.59

Let me note at this point that I find this approach receptive to the
kind of scholarship being pursued by [some critical feminist
scholars]{.underline}. Such scholars [have been successful at borrowing
from problem-solving theories, yet still with a quest for progressive
change]{.underline}. In their analysis of social movements, for
instance, Meyer and Lupo argue that feminism's uniqueness derives from
its ability to consistently illuminate the relationship between self and
community.60 Critical feminist scholarship is interested in processes of
domination that are often silenced by the mainstream's fetishism with
the state, power and anarchy, a commitment that results from the 'lived
injustices' or sufferings of marginalised groups.61 Thus, feminist
scholars' commitment to emancipatory politics is 'aimed at transforming
relations of inequality and domination'.62 Additionally, feminist
scholars have carefully examined the concept of intersectionality, which
mainly emphasises the interwoven nature of race, class, gender and
sexuality in order to show the mutually constitutive nature of identity
and structures of inequality.63 And 'because intersectional knowledge is
grounded in everyday lives of people of diverse backgrounds, it is seen
as an important tool linking theory with practice'.64 These 'feminist
characteristics' are elements that the approach espoused below
identifies with and, in fact, I hope that the notion of PD will
encourage discussions among scholars interested in progressive social
change through research. [As some critical scholars are already doing,
[we should]{.mark} particularly [ask: '**how should we do our research
in order to increase the likelihood that it will actually help make the
world a better place?**']{.mark}]{.underline}.65

#### No neg offense --- critical theory and problem-solving theory [aren't mutually exclusive]{.underline}.

International Relations ([IR]{.underline}) [theory is typically divided
into]{.underline} two: [traditional]{.underline} (often known as
[problem-solving]{.underline}/rationalist) [theory and
critical]{.underline} (often referred to as reflectivist/interpretivist)
[theory]{.underline}. Traditional theories remain the most predominant
in the field of study as they often have powerful proponents and a
larger number of disciples. The Oxford English Dictionary defines
tradition as 'a long established and generally accepted custom or method
of procedure, having almost the force of a law'.3 In this context
anything 'traditional' is 'observant \[end page 59\] of, bound by
tradition'.4 The origins of the theories are what make them cohere as
traditional theories of IR and include realism (neorealism and critical
realism); the English School; and liberal theories (liberalism,
neoliberalism, global governance and cosmopolitanism). These are
theories that often dwell on ancient and classical writings from
Aristotle to Voltaire, and are sometimes committed to (re)interpreting
these writings as though they were written for this contemporary age.
They are also traditional because they possess the force of law where,
for instance, the 'realist gambit'5 has been dominant as well as the
(neo)liberal 'common-sense'.6

Theories considered to be critical include feminism, post-structuralism,
securitisation and postcolonialism, among others. The question then is:
what makes them 'critical'? As Steven Roach asserts, 'what makes
critical IR theory "critical" is its self-awareness as a theory'---an
awareness woven into the critical traditions of Kant, Hegel, Marx,
Habermas, Derrida and Butler7---and we can certainly add Michel Foucault
among other post-Enlightenment French philosophers. It is argued that
critical theory was introduced into IR in 1981 with the publication of
Robert Cox's Social Forces, States and World Orders and Richard K
Ashley's Political Realism and Human Interests.8 A discussion of the
so-called 'great debates' will show that critical theorists are
generally post- positivist and to a large extent anti-foundationalist in
that they do not accept any objective, Archimedean point or standard by
which 'legitimate' knowledge should be measured. And they are also
postmodern in the sense that they oppose the teleological measurement of
human progress that characterises Enlightenment thinking, in addition to
their quest to deconstruct established interpretations (discourse) in
order to ascertain their embedded 'silences'. It is based on this common
ontological and epistemological orientation that neo- Gramscian theory
and deconstructionism manage to fit under critical IR theory.

The problem, however, is that [[couching]{.mark} the broader field
[into]{.mark} two [binaries]{.mark}--- what Cox]{.underline} in 1981
[classified as problem-solving and critical theory]{.underline},
respectively[---[is **a problematic simplification**]{.mark} of the
discussion of i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations.
Although many people will agree that there is no pure form of these two
main schools, some IR textbooks, course syllabuses and journal articles
perpetuate this trend.9 [[This]{.mark} configuration of the field
[inhibits the **multidimensional** nature]{.mark} of the subject matter.
In an attempt [to reconcile the binary]{.mark} between
problem-solving]{.underline} (rationalist) [theories and
critical]{.underline} (interpretivist) [theory, [this]{.mark}
paper]{.underline} also [tries to construct]{.underline} what can be
considered [a ['third way']{.mark} in IR theorising for those who seek
to transcend what is usually characteristic of either of these
theoretical traditions]{.underline}. The crux of the entire paper is to
explain why the contention here is to adopt a 'third way' (what I refer
to as 'praxeological deconstructionism'10) as opposed to the rationalist
and reflectivist/interpretivist schools in IR theory. [The quest [is to
make the discipline **practically relevant in explaining the 'here and
now' while not abandoning the need to be critical and
self-reflexive**]{.mark} **in its theorising**]{.underline}. Overall the
paper initiates a purposive call for the dual goal of deconstruction and
reconstruction, a normative and instrumental position that the 'thick
descriptions' of most critical theorists (particularly those belonging
to the 'post-' approaches) often fail to emphasise.11

### AT: Policy Failure

#### Reversing [policy failure]{.underline} does [NOT require methodological consistency]{.underline}, merely [causal policy relevance]{.underline} -- [ALT makes it worse]{.underline} through [theoretical reification]{.underline} and [alienating policymakers]{.underline}

\--reification = confusing deliberately oversimplified theory with the
complex reality it attempts to describe

Director of the Notre Dame International Security Center at the
University of Notre Dame, "Conclusions, Responses to Objections, and
Scholarly Recommendations," Chapter 9, *Cult of the Irrelevant: The
Waning Influence of Social Science on National Security*, Princeton
University Press, 2019, ISBN 978-0-691-18121-9, pp.250-251 /GoGreen!

[There are]{.underline}, of course, some [nuts-and-bolts issues that
scholars should be mindful of if they want to participate in the broader
policy debate]{.underline}. Since policymakers have short attention
spans given the number and breadth of issues they have to deal with,
scholarly efforts to engage them need to be brief in conveying their
ideas.70 This explains why Op/Eds are particularly influential and why
so many are optimistic that blogs could play a similar role. Moreover,
[[**policymakers** find much]{.mark} current [scholarly
work]{.mark}---from **across the methodological
spectrum**---**[inaccessible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The common
sentiment animating their views is that [scholars [should **cut the
jargon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Policymakers don't want scholars to
write in Greek or French]{.underline}, but rather just plain English.71

There are also some much bigger issues undergirding the relevance
question.72 To begin with, [political science needs to **rethink how it
balances**]{.underline} scholarly [**rigor with practical application**.
There is a]{.underline} **[middle ground]{.underline}** [between policy
analysis and journalism]{.underline}, on one side, [and]{.underline}
**[scholastic irrelevance]{.underline}** on the other.73
[[The]{.underline} **[best approach]{.underline}**]{.mark} to balancing
scholarly rigor with continuing policy relevance
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [**methodological pluralism**, which includes
a commitment to [using **not any particular
method**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} **[all of
them]{.underline}**) [**[but]{.mark}** rather just [the approach most
**appropriate for the question**]{.mark} **at hand**]{.underline}. But
methodological pluralism, by itself, is not sufficient. The latest trend
in political science requiring the simultaneous use of multiple methods
could, ironically, prove to be even more limiting of policy relevance.
Indeed, given the need to employ all of these methods simultaneously, it
is potentially even more constraining in terms of the problems it can
address because it has to be limited to those which can be quantified,
modeled, and studied in depth at the same time.74 Therefore,
**[reinforcing]{.underline}** [methodological pluralism must also be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[commitment to problem-, rather than method-,
driven research]{.mark} agendas**. It is only the
**combination**]{.underline} [of these]{.underline} two [principles that
[will ensure]{.mark} that [**policy-relevant security studies**
can]{.mark}]{.underline} not only **[[survive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
but thrive, in political science.75

[Scholars also need to think carefully about the role of theory in
policy-relevant **security studies** scholarship]{.underline}.
[[While]{.mark} there is no doubt that [theory is important]{.mark} to
policymakers, scholars need to be aware that as with many other things,
**[too much]{.mark}**]{.underline} of it [[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[bad]{.underline}]{.mark}** thing. [In particular, the [effort to
**cram the rich complexity of the social world into universal
models**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[can do **intellectual violence to the
phenomenon under study**]{.underline} [as well as produce **suboptimal
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Paul Nitze, then the director of the
Secretary of State's Policy Planning Staff, readily conceded
policymakers' need for theory but also noted that "there is the opposing
consideration .. . that [\[theoretical\] **oversimplification** presents
**great dangers**]{.underline}."76 Albert Wohlstetter advocated a
balanced approach to theory, noting that the key to his success
throughout his career "was the practical experience I had in working
with engineers. I worked with them from two sides, so to speak, as
someone who had been concerned with very abstract theory more basic than
that familiar to design engineers, but on the other hand, I was also
concerned with production, and therefore generally trying to get them to
do things more practical than they wanted to do."77 [Theory is a
powerful]{.underline} **[tool]{.underline}** of statecraft, [but when
scholars embrace universal models they also]{.underline} **[[risk
irrelevance or worse]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Likewise, the **[transmission belts conveying scholarly findings to the
policy world must be repaired]{.underline}**. Kennan envisioned the
State Department's Policy Planning Staff in the late 1940s serving this
function, and in some respects it continues to do so to this day.78
However, there are limits to how effectively a part of the bureaucracy
can serve as an honest research broker. A plethora of think tanks in
Washington are also supposed to translate knowledge into action, though
the trend in recent years has been toward the establishment of overtly
political and advocacy organizations, rather than nonpartisan,
translational research centers.79 Reinventing the role of think tanks as
bridges between the Ivory Tower and the beltway is long overdue.

[While nonacademic transmission belts can mediate between the Ivory
Tower and the Beltway, they are]{.underline} [**[no substitute for the
scholars who produce knowledge to]{.mark} themselves [serve as their own
translators]{.mark} of it [into policy]{.mark}**. To be sure, scholars
should not stop writing scholarly books and monographs]{.underline}
utilizing the most sophisticated techniques of their discipline, if
appropriate. In addition to doing these things, [scholars
should]{.underline} **[address]{.underline}** pressing **[real world
problems, not just chase after disciplinary fads]{.underline}**. **[No
one]{.underline}** [is in a better position to highlight the policy
implications of a given piece of research than the individual who
conducted it]{.underline}. [Academic social scientists, **if they want
to be heard by senior policymakers**, and heard correctly, **need to be
their own policy "transmission belts**]{.underline}."80

[[The role of]{.mark} the **[D]{.mark}**emocratic **[P]{.mark}**eace
**[T]{.mark}**heory [in]{.mark} the recent **[Iraq]{.mark} war**
[demonstrates]{.mark} the problems with scholars not specifying the
concrete policy implications of their research]{.underline}.81 [Drawing
on]{.underline} **[DPT]{.underline}**, some [officials in
the]{.underline} George W. [**Bush** administration **justified**
the]{.underline} [**invasion of Iraq** as part of a larger strategy to
bring peace to the region by spreading democracy]{.underline}.82
[Democratic Peace proponent Bruce Russett]{.underline} [**objected** to
this conclusion **after the fact**]{.underline} though his voice had
been largely mute in the run up to the war.83 [[Had]{.mark} he and other
democracy **[scholars participated more actively]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[in the]{.underline} **[prewar debate]{.underline}**, [[this
**rationale** may have been]{.underline} **[less

[Over the past decade, the "**cult of irrelevance**" in political
science scholarship has been lamented by a growing chorus]{.underline}
(Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009). [Prominent scholars]{.underline} of
international affairs [have diagnosed]{.underline} the roots of [the
gap]{.underline} between academia and policymaking, [made the case for
why political science research is valuable for
policymaking]{.underline}, [and offered]{.underline} a number of
[ideas]{.underline} for enhancing the policy relevance of scholarship in
international relations and comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead
2010; Van Evera 2010; Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and
Desch 2014). Building on these insights, [several initiatives have been
formed]{.underline} in the attempt to "bridge the gap."2
[Many]{.underline} of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects [focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate]{.underline} the [findings and
implications]{.underline} of their research [to the policymaking
community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric.

[Yet enhancing communication]{.underline} between scholars and
policymakers [is only one component]{.underline} of bridging the gap
between international affairs theory and practice. [Another]{.underline}
crucial component of this bridge [is the **generation of substantive
research programs that are actually policy relevant**]{.underline}---a
challenge to which less concerted attention has been paid. The dual
challenges of bridging the gap are especially acute for graduate
students, a particular irony since many enter the discipline with the
explicit hope of informing policy. [In a field that has an admirable
devotion to pedagogical self-reflection]{.underline}, **[strikingly
little attention is paid to techniques for generating policy-relevant
ideas]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} dissertation and other [research
topics]{.underline}. Although numerous articles and conference workshops
are devoted to the importance of experiential and problem-based
learning, especially through techniques of simulation that emulate
policymaking processes (Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012;
Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014), little has been written about the use of
such techniques for generating and developing innovative research ideas.

[This article outlines an experiential and problem-based approach
to]{.underline} developing a [political science research]{.underline}
program [using scenario analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on
illuminating the research generation and pedagogical benefits of this
technique by describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era
Foreign Policy Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral
students of international and comparative affairs who share a
demonstrated interest in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the
introductory section, the article outlines the practice of scenario
analysis and considers the utility of the technique in political
science. We argue that scenario analysis should be viewed as a tool to
stimulate problem-based learning for doctoral students and discuss the
broader scholarly benefits of using scenarios to help generate research
ideas. The second section details the manner in which NEFPC deploys
scenario analysis. The third section reflects upon some of the concrete
scholarly benefits that have been realized from the scenario format. The
fourth section offers insights on the pedagogical potential associated
with using scenarios in the classroom across levels of study. A brief
conclusion reflects on the importance of developing specific techniques
to aid those who wish to generate political science scholarship of
relevance to the policy world.

What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science?

[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[[Scenario analysis is]{.mark} thus **[typically seen as serving]{.mark}
the purposes of [corporate planning or]{.mark} as a [policy]{.mark}
tool**]{.underline} to be used in combination with simulations of
decision making. **[[Yet]{.mark} scenario analysis [is not inherently
limited to these uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This section]{.underline}
provides a brief overview of the practice of scenario analysis and the
motivations underpinning its uses. It then [makes a case for the utility
of the technique for political science scholarship]{.underline} and
describes how the scenarios deployed at NEFPC were created.

The Art of Scenario Analysis

[We characterize scenario analysis as the art of juxtaposing current
trends in unexpected combinations in order [to **articulate surprising
and yet plausible futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, often **[referred to
as "[alternative worlds]{.mark}."]{.underline}** [Scenarios
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus **[[explicitly not forecasts or
projections based on linear extrapolations]{.mark} of contemporary
patterns]{.underline}**, [and they are **[not hypothesis-based expert
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Nor]{.mark} should they be
equated with [simulations]{.mark}**, which are]{.underline} best
characterized as [functional representations of **real institutions** or
decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[[Instead]{.mark},
they are [depictions of possible future states of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, offered **[[together with]{.mark} a
narrative of the [driving causal forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
potential exogenous shocks **[[that could lead to those
futures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Good scenarios thus rely on explicit
causal propositions that, independent of one another, are
plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way.

While scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic
planning during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary
practice are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and
early 1970s (Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially
initiated at Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the
usual forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector.

Building on its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013).

[Several features [make **scenario analysis particularly
useful**]{.mark} for policymaking]{.underline}.5 [Long-term global
trends across a number of different realms]{.underline}---social,
technological, environmental, economic, and political---[combine in
often-unexpected ways to produce unforeseen challenges]{.underline}.
[Yet the [ability]{.mark} of decision makers [to **imagine**, let alone
prepare for, discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} in the policy realm
[[is **constrained** by]{.mark} their [existing mental models and
maps]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This limitation is exacerbated by
**[well-known cognitive bias tendencies such as groupthink and
confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jervis 1976; Janis 1982;
Tetlock 2005). [The power of [scenarios]{.mark} lies in their ability to
[help individuals **break out of conventional modes of
thinking**]{.mark} and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of
trends and deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the
future]{.underline}. **[[Imagining alternative future worlds through a
structured analytical process enables policymakers to envision and
thereby adapt to something altogether different from the known
present]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Designing Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry

The characteristics of scenario analysis that commend its use to
policymakers also make it well suited to helping political scientists
generate and develop policy-relevant research programs. [Scenarios are
essentially textured, plausible, and relevant stories that help us
imagine how the future]{.underline} political-economic world [could be
different from the past]{.underline} in a manner that highlights policy
challenges and opportunities. For example, terrorist organizations are a
known threat that have captured the attention of the policy community,
yet our responses to them tend to be linear and reactive. Scenarios that
explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of change---the rise of a new
peer competitor in the East that diverts strategic attention, volatile
commodity prices that empower and disempower various state and nonstate
actors in surprising ways, and the destabilizing effects of climate
change or infectious disease pandemics---can be useful for illuminating
the nature and limits of the terrorist threat in ways that may be missed
by a narrower focus on recognized states and groups. By illuminating the
potential strategic significance of specific and yet poorly understood
opportunities and threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial
gaps in our collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends
and dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social
science scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality
itself. [Very simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief
often-overlooked yet pressing questions in international affairs that
demand focused investigation]{.underline}.

[Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in principle, [an innovative tool
for developing a political science research agenda]{.underline}. In
practice, [achieving this objective requires careful tailoring of the
approach]{.underline}. The specific scenario analysis technique we
outline below was designed and refined to provide a structured
experiential process for generating problem-based research questions
with contemporary international policy relevance.6 The first step in the
process of creating the scenario set described here was to identify
important causal forces in contemporary global affairs. Consensus was
not the goal; on the contrary, some of these causal statements
represented competing theories about global change (e.g., a resurgence
of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing forces). A major
principle underpinning the transformation of these causal drivers into
possible future worlds was to "simplify, then exaggerate" them, before
fleshing out the emerging story with more details.7 Thus, the contours
of the future world were drawn first in the scenario, with details about
the possible pathways to that point filled in second. It is entirely
possible, indeed probable, that some of the causal claims that turned
into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so much as to be implausible,
and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our own form of groupthink
went into construction of the scenarios. One of the great strengths of
scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario discussions themselves,
as described below, lay bare these especially implausible claims and
systematic biases.8

An explicit methodological approach underlies the written scenarios
themselves as well as the analytical process around them---that of
case-centered, structured, focused comparison, intended especially to
shed light on new causal mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use
of scenarios is similar to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies
certain variables in a given situation in order to analyze the resulting
effects]{.underline} (Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are
traditionally retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events
that did not actually occur in the context of known history, our
**[scenarios are deliberately forward-looking]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} are [designed to **explore potential
futures**]{.underline} that could unfold. As such, counterfactual
analysis is especially well suited to identifying how individual events
might expand or shift the "funnel of choices" available to political
actors and thus lead to different historical outcomes (Nye 2005,
68--69), while forward-looking scenario analysis can better illuminate
surprising intersections and sociopolitical dynamics without the
perceptual constraints imposed by fine-grained historical knowledge. [We
see scenarios as a complementary resource for exploring these dynamics
in international affairs, rather than as a replacement]{.underline} for
counterfactual analysis, historical case studies, or other
methodological tools.

In the scenario process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios
are employed, acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario,
as detailed below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which
represent hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in
evolving international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself
employs templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas.

[The scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance.

[The scenario approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the
belief that these traditional approaches can be complemented by
identifying questions likely to be of **great empirical importance** in
the real world, even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles
[**in existing research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [scenarios]{.underline} analyzed at NEFPC
[envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium (five to
seven year) term and are designed to **tease out issues scholars and
policymakers may encounter in the relatively near future**]{.underline}
[so that they can **begin thinking critically about them
now**]{.underline}. [This timeframe offers a period distant enough from
the present as to avoid falling into current events analysis, but not so
far into the future as to seem like science fiction]{.underline}. In
imagining the worlds in which these scenarios might come to pass,
[[participants **learn strategies for avoiding failures of creativity**
and for **overturning the assumptions that prevent scholars and analysts
from anticipating and understanding**]{.mark} the pivotal junctures that
arise in international affairs]{.underline}.

1\. Introduction

The most extreme type of risk is the risk of a global catastrophe
causing permanent worldwide destruction to human civilization. In the
most extreme cases, human extinction could occur. Global catastrophic
risk (GCR) is thus risk of events of the highest magnitude of
consequences, and the risks merit serious attention even if the
probabilities of such events are low. Indeed, a growing chorus of
scholars rates GCR reduction as among the most important priorities for
society today. Unfortunately, many analysts also estimate frighteningly
high probabilities of global catastrophe, with one even stating "I think
the odds are no better than fifty-fifty that our present civilization on
Earth will survive to the end of the present century" (Rees 2003:8).

Regardless of what the probabilities are, it is clear that humanity
today faces a variety of serious GCRs. To an extent, humanity always has
faced GCRs, in the form of supervolcano eruptions, impacts from large
asteroids and comets, and remnants of stellar explosions. Events like
these have contributed to several mass extinction events across Earth's
history. The Toba volcano eruption about 70,000 years ago may have come
close to bringing the human species to a premature end. However,
[**[scholars]{.mark}** of GCR [generally believe]{.mark} that today's
**[greatest risks]{.mark}** derive from human activity. These GCRs
[include **war** with **bio**]{.mark}logical [or **nuc**]{.mark}**lear**
**[weapons]{.mark}**, extreme **climate change** and other
**environmental threats**, [and **misuse** or **accidents**
involving]{.mark} powerful **[emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies [like
**a**]{.mark}**rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[syn]{.mark}thetic
[bio]{.mark}logy]{.underline}**. These GCRs threaten far greater
destruction than was seen in the World Wars, the 1918 flu, the Black
Death plague, or other major catastrophes of recent memory.

[The **high stakes** and **urgent threats** of GCR **demand** careful
**analysis** of the **risks** and the opportunities for addressing
them]{.underline}. However, several factors make GCR difficult to
analyze. One factor is the unprecedented nature of global catastrophes.
Many of the catastrophes have never occurred in any form, and of course
no previous global catastrophe has ever destroyed modern human
civilization. The lack of precedent means that analysts cannot rely on
historical data as much as they can for smaller, more frequent events.
Another factor is the complexity of GCRs, involving global economic,
political, and industrial systems, which present difficult analytical
decisions about which details to include. Finally, the high stakes of
GCR pose difficult dilemmas about the extent to which GCR reduction
should be prioritized relative to other issues.

In this paper we present an overview of contemporary GCR scholarship and
related issues for risk analysis and risk management. We focus less on
the risks themselves, each of which merits its own dedicated treatment.
Other references are recommended for the risks, perhaps the best of
which are the relevant chapters of Bostrom and Ćirković (2008). Instead,
our focus here is on overarching themes of importance to the breadth of
the GCRs. The following section defines GCR in more detail and explains
why many researchers consider it to be so important. Next, some of the
analytical challenges that GCR poses and the techniques that have been
developed to meet these challenges are explained. There follows a
discussion of some dilemmas that arise when GCR reduction would require
great sacrifice or would interfere with each other. Finally, conclusions
are drawn.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important?

[Taken **literally**, a global catastrophe can be any event that is in
some way catastrophic across the globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a
rather low threshold]{.underline} for what counts as a global
catastrophe. An event causing just one death on each continent (say,
from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because
surely these deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their
loved ones. [However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be
**catastrophic** for a significant portion of the globe]{.underline}.
Minimum thresholds have variously been set around ten thousand to ten
million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and
Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter of the human population
(Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have emphasized catastrophes
that cause **long-term declines in the trajectory of human
civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that human civilization
**does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and Baum 2013), [that
drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004).

[A common theme across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some
catastrophes are]{.mark} vastly [more important]{.mark} than
others**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to recognize
this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983). [Without nuclear
winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred million people.
This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity would presumably
carry on. However, with **nuclear winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan,
[**humanity could go extinct**. The loss would be not just an additional
four billion or so deaths, but the [loss of **all future
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species.]{.underline}

[Sagan's 500 trillion number may even be [an
**underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The analysis here takes an
adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the
long-term fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the
descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably
"human". The issue then is whether the descendants are still worth
caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs the question
of how many of them there will be. Barring major global catastrophe,
Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more years 2 until the
Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way
galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse will remain
habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin 1997), should
our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An open question in
astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants of humanity to
continue living for an **infinite length of time** or instead merely an
**astronomically large but finite** length of time]{.underline} (see
e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the stakes with global
catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss of 500 trillion
lives**]{.underline}.

[**[Debates]{.mark}** about the infinite vs. the merely astronomical are
of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007),
[but they have **limited practical significance**. This can be seen when
**evaluating GCRs from a standard
risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude framework**. Using Sagan's 500
trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the probability of
global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance is of the same
significance as saving one human life. Phrased differently, society
[should **try 500 trillion times harder to prevent**]{.mark} **a [global
catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it should to [save a person's
life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million deaths is equivalent to a
one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of global catastrophe.
This suggests society should **make extremely large investment in GCR
reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives**]{.underline}.

Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a similar point in monetary
terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as the value of a statistical
human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the total loss of life (double
the 2004 world population); he describes both figures as significant
underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600 trillion as an
underestimate of the value of preventing global catastrophe. For
comparison, the United States government typically uses a VSL of around
one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying a \$10 million
VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value of preventing
global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion, [society
should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to prevent a
global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least
[\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of
global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable disagreement
exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count future
generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**]{.underline}.

[The discussion thus far has assumed that all human lives are valued
equally. This assumption is **not universally held**]{.underline}.
[People often value some people more than others]{.underline}, favoring
themselves, their family and friends, their compatriots, their
generation, or others whom they identify with. [Great debates rage on
across moral philosophy, economics, and other fields about how much
people should value others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time,
or social relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations.
[This debate is crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk,
including GCR. Indeed, if each of us only cares about our immediate
selves, then global catastrophes may not be especially important, and we
probably have better things to do with our time than worry about them.

[While everyone has the right to their **own views and
feelings**]{.underline}, we find that [the strongest arguments are for
the **widely held position** that **all human lives should be valued
equally**.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in the United
States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848 Declaration of
Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and 3
women are created equal". [Philosophers speak of [a]{.mark}n
agent-neutral, objective "**[view from nowhere]{.mark}**"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or a "veil of ignorance"]{.underline} (Rawls 1971) [in
which each person considers what is best for society **irrespective of
which member of society they happen to be**]{.underline}. [Such a
perspective **suggests [valuing everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless
of who they are or where or when they live. This in turn [suggests a
**very high value for reducing GCR**]{.mark}, or a high degree of
priority for GCR reduction efforts.]{.underline}

### Consequentialism Good

#### Evaluate [causal consequences]{.underline} -- [subsumes]{.underline} the effects of [representations]{.underline} -- BUT conflating "causes" with "justifies" is [ethically bankrupt]{.underline}

**Fairclough and Fairclough 18**---emeritus Professor of Linguistics at
Lancaster University AND School of Humanities and Social Sciences,
University of Central Lancashire (Norman and Isabela, "A procedural
approach to ethical critique in CDA," Critical Discourse Studies Volume
15, 2018 - Issue 2, 169-185, dml) \[CDA=critical discourse analysis\]

The term 'discourse ethics' is Habermas's (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
30-34), but we are using it here in a general sense: for the view that
[[a]{.mark}n **adequate [framework for ethical evaluation]{.mark}** and
**critique [must include]{.mark} the comparison** and **evaluation of
different arguments for different lines of action** in a process of
deliberation]{.underline}. Such assessments of arguments pose difficult
problems, and deliberation is by no means guaranteed to produce
consensus. Nevertheless, [deliberation can **contribute to the quality
of ethical critique** by ensuring that a **wide range of arguments are
considered** in making decisions, that all alternatives are **taken into
account** and **thoroughly criticized**, and that people have to (at
least) **moderate their own partialities** in evaluating a range of
arguments collectively]{.underline}. To illustrate this, we shall refer
to two ethically contentious political decisions and the courses of
action which they led to. The first is the decision by the British Prime
Minister Tony Blair to advocate Britain's participation in the invasion
of Iraq in 2003 (we have discussed this in Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
96-97). The second is the decision by the German Chancellor Angela
Merkel to open Germany's borders to the refugees coming from the Middle
East in the autumn of 2015. In so doing, we will illustrate the
relevance of ethical critique from all three of the major ethical
positions: deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics. CDA and
practical argumentation CDA is mainly concerned with [critical analysis
of discourse]{.underline} which [is **oriented to action**]{.underline},
including political discourse, but also managerial, organisational and
other forms of discourse. [The **primary activity** in such discourse is
**practical [argumentation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, argumentation over
action, [[over **what is to be done**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.
**[[what policies should be adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Practical
argumentation should]{.underline} accordingly [be the **primary
analytical focus**]{.underline} in CDA (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012).
[This **[does not exclude]{.mark} other**]{.underline} familiar **[forms
of analysis]{.underline}** ([such as **[analysing
rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[but **subsumes
them**]{.mark}. The point of]{.underline} representing (or
['framing']{.underline}) [an issue in a particular way is to **create
particular public attitudes** and **opinions**, and thus **legitimize**
or **facilitate a particular course of action**.]{.underline} Critique
of discourse is the focal concern for CDA, but critique of discourse is
by no means exclusive to CDA. On the contrary, [critique of
discourse]{.underline} is a normal part of all discourse. It [is a
**normal part of everyday practical argumentation**: people **find
reasons in favour** and **against proposals for action**, they
**consider alternatives**, **adopt them** or **discard them**, and so
on. A course of action **worthy of being adopted** is **one that has
withstood criticism**. Agents [may]{.mark} decide to [discard]{.mark}
proposals [either because]{.mark} they are **likely to be
[instrumentally inadequate]{.mark}** in relation to the goals they are
supposed to achieve, [or]{.mark} because they find them **[ethically
problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example because the values or
goals they are motivated by are unacceptable. Ethical critique is a
concern for CDA at three levels: as an aspect of agents' reasoning, for
example as an aspect of politicians' deliberation over what policy to
adopt; as an aspect of the normative critique of those deliberative
practices which CDA carries out; as an aspect of the critique that CDA
itself is open to. There are therefore three main places where ethical
values come into the picture: what values are arguers (e.g. politicians)
arguing from? what are the values that CDA analysts are espousing, from
the perspective of which they are evaluating the arguments of those
arguers? what are the values of other critics (including critics of
CDA)? [CDA]{.underline} is itself a form of discourse, which is
specialized for academic critique of social actions, events, practices
and structures, with a focus on discourse. It [can itself be viewed as a
**form of practical argumentation**]{.underline} (Fairclough 2013),
[open to the **same critical questions** that it directs at the
discourse it subjects to critique]{.underline}. CDA practitioners are
bound by an obligation to address ethical evaluations that are critical
of their work. Moreover, [the ethical judgement which is part of the
normative critique carried out]{.underline} in CDA [**does not come out
of thin air**, but is built upon elements drawn selectively from ethical
judgement and critique in public discourse]{.underline}. And CDA needs
to rethink its own critique in response to shifts in public discourse
and political reality, such as the emergence of controversy over
'political correctness' (Fairclough 2003). We have argued that [the
**primary focus** of critical analysis]{.underline} in CDA [should be
**practical argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline}
(Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). This was based upon a claim about the
character of political discourse, which we saw as [primarily concerned
with the question of **what is to be done**]{.underline}. [Deliberation
is an abstract genre in which **(alternative) proposals are being
tested**. The **framework**]{.underline} for critical analysis [of
**practical argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline} which we
have developed since 2012 [provides]{.underline} CDA with [an
**effective way of evaluating** and **critiquing discourse** from an
**ethical point of view**]{.underline}. One of its strengths is that [it
allows **different approaches** to thinking about ethical
questions]{.underline} (deontological, consequentialist and virtue
ethics) [to be combined within an **ethical deliberative procedure for
achieving impartiality**]{.underline}. In a more recent version of this
framework (Fairclough, I. 2016, 2018), [deliberation is modelled as a
critical procedure designed to **filter out those practical
conclusions**]{.underline} (and corresponding decisions) [that **would
not pass the test of critical questioning**]{.underline}. Two distinct
argument schemes are involved in deliberative activity types: an
argument from goals, circumstances and meansgoal relations, and an
argument from (negative or positive) consequences. [Proposals are
**tentatively supported** by **practical arguments from goals**, and are
**[tested in]{.mark} the [light of]{.mark} their [potential
consequences]{.mark}**, via **practical arguments from
consequence**]{.underline}. Goals are generated by various sources of
normativity, and these can be what conventionally is called 'values',
but can also be obligations, rights and duties. [Critical questioning
seeks to **expose potential negative consequences** of proposals and
thus evaluate them in terms of their **acceptability** or
**reasonableness**: if the consequences are **on balance unacceptable**
for those affected, then it would be **more reasonable not to engage in
the proposed course of action**. [Unacceptable consequences are
**critical objections** which]{.mark} can **conclusively [rebut a
proposal]{.mark}**. Where two or more proposals survive critical
testing, one may be **chosen as the better proposal** on nonarbitrary
grounds]{.underline} (e.g. being simpler to enact). In our view, [the
**most significant perspective** in the light of which proposals are to
be tested is a **consequentialist** one]{.underline} (Fairclough &
Fairclough 2012, Fairclough, I. 2016). The term 'consequence' is however
used here broadly to refer to several types of states-of-affairs: the
goals of the proposed action (the intended consequences); the potential
unintended consequences (or risks) involved; various known and
predictable impacts, including impacts on institutional, social facts.
[[If]{.mark} a proposal is [**likely to result in a situation** that
is]{.mark}]{.underline} illegal or [[**unjust**, then]{.mark} the
proposal [can be **evaluated as unacceptable** from both]{.mark} a
**[consequentialist]{.mark} ethics** [and]{.mark} a
**[deontological]{.mark} ethical [position]{.mark}**. [Our framework
can]{.mark} therefore **[accommodate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
deontological [[**ethical issues** within a **broader consequentialist
perspective**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By inquiring into the motives of
action, the framework can also accommodate a virtue-ethical perspective.

### AT: ! -- Self-Authorization

**Gill-Tiney 22** Patrick Gill-Tiney, Stipendiary Lecturer in Politics,
St. John's College, Oxford, "A Liberal Peace?: The Growth of Liberal
Norms and the Decline of Interstate Violence," Journal of Conflict
Resolution, 66(3), 2022, pp.413-442 /GoGreen!

This article shows that [[**liberal interpretations** of
**sovereignty**]{.mark}, which emphasize international law,
interdependence, free trade, democracy and individual rights and
freedoms]{.underline}, have become increasingly prevalent in UN Security
Council resolutions since 1970. Given that two non-western states,
Russia/Soviet Union and China, are permanent members, I argue that the
content of these resolutions [[reflects **broad consensus**
between]{.mark} major [powers---**both western and
non-western**]{.mark}---as how these norms should be
interpreted]{.underline}. [This is **not** the same as arguing that
these states **share preferences or interests**]{.underline}, rather,
substantial differences remain, largely along the cleavage between the
United States, Britain and France on the one hand and China and Russia
on the other (Einsiedel and Malone 2018, 156-58).1 [**Yet**, the
**[collective positions]{.mark}** of these states [have **evolved over
time**]{.mark}, suggesting [a **shift** in **how sovereignty is
understood**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The dominant role that these states
have in shaping the international order means that their collective
understandings may be taken as representative of the normative structure
of international society at any point in time]{.underline}, with the
expectation that this impacts all states in the system.2

I argue that [[as **liberal interpretations** of]{.mark} these
fundamental [**norms** increase, the **likelihood** of]{.mark} a dispute
participant resorting to [**violence** decreases]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Through content analysis of all UN Security Council resolutions between
1970 and 2014 I first create a measure of the strength of liberal
interpretations of sovereignty. This is then utilized in
[**[quantitative analysis]{.mark}** of dispute participants]{.underline}
in the period to [explain the variation in the level of violence
employed]{.underline}. [I find statistical and substantive support for
my theory, [showing **empirically**]{.mark} that the growth in **liberal
norm interpretations** is **negatively associated** with the likelihood
of a state resorting to violence in an interstate dispute]{.underline}.

[This is [**not** to argue]{.mark} that [**structural** arguments are
wrong]{.mark}, far from it, **[nor]{.mark}** is it [to reject the roles
of conventional and nuclear capabilities]{.mark} in shaping interstate
conflict behavior. **[Rather]{.mark}**, **[state power does
matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is why the collective
interpretations of the permanent members of the UN Security Council are
used to understand the system. [Domestic veto players, intergovernmental
enforcement mechanisms, and trade dependency all do shape the responses
of policymakers during an interstate dispute. [However]{.mark}, the
**[intersubjective ideas]{.mark}** they carry with them into disputes
[are **also crucial to understand** why **some disputes escalate**, and
**others do not**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article contributes to our understanding of the role that ideas
have in shaping interstate conflict in two ways. Firstly, I contribute
to the large literature which has sought to understand the role which
norms play in selecting for certain behaviors over others. Most of the
work within this area has been qualitative and has either charted the
development of specific bundles of norms over long periods (Keene 2012,
2013; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Sandholtz 2007) or focused on the
life-cycle of specific norms (Eckstein 1988; Finnemore 2000; Finnemore
and Sikkink 1998; Krook and True 2012; Nadelmann 1990; Sandholtz 2007;
Sandholtz and Stiles 2008). I build upon these insights by arguing that
the norm of sovereignty has been re-interpreted over time, and that the
collective nature of reinterpretation means that it can be used to
examine its impact in interstate conflict.

Secondly, this article provides an innovative means of exploring ideas
in a quantitative framework. The quantitative interstate conflict
literature has heavily favored structural and power-based explanations
for actor behavior. This has come at the particular expense of norms.
Whilst there is widespread acceptance that norms matter amongst these
scholars, they have tended to set aside norm-based explanations given
the difficulty of objective measurement. This difficulty revolves around
the problem of having surety that multiple actors share an idea, that
is, intersubjective understanding. The most obvious sources of data to
assess this would be a survey of policymakers or the content of
international legal documents. This first avenue is incredibly difficult
to gain anything but anecdotal responses too. Policymakers are hard to
get access to and may misrepresent their own thoughts and actions to
show themselves in as best light as possible. Ensuring that any
respondents have understood the survey in the same way is difficult
given language differences, whilst response rates are likely to be so
low as to prevent a non-random sample from being acquired, even if the
potential pool of relevant participants is widened to include all senior
politicians and bureaucrats, both incumbent and preceding.

Some of these problems are resolved by utilizing the texts of
international legal documents. Given that these are generally carefully
and cautiously written the researcher is more certain that the drafters
actually share an understanding of the topic. Recent work by Allee and
co-authors (Allee, Elsig, and Lugg 2017; Allee and Lugg 2016) have
innovatively utilized content analysis of interstate trade deals to
explore how much is replicated in subsequent deals, which sheds light on
the relative power of the participants. This has certainly gained deeper
understanding of the topic, but is not a suitable approach for this
research questions for two reasons. Firstly, these deals are generally
drafted by small numbers of states, that is, they may not be assumed to
represent the preferences and interests of nonparties. Secondly, whilst
interpretations are spelled out, these may be mechanistic rather than
ideational, making it unclear what the broader normative position may
be. This is made more acute by the drafting being down by bureaucrats
and lawyers rather than policymakers themselves. Whilst some direction
is no-doubt given by the latter, assuming a high level is problematic.
Utilizing the content of UN Security Council resolutions addresses these
problems because the documents may be assumed to be political, that is,
though member states are represented by ambassadors, a high-level of
involvement by their state governments is typical given the importance
attached to security issues. Moreover, since the permanent membership is
diverse in interests and preferences, and these members can veto
unpalatable resolutions, they may be reasonably assumed to provide
insight into intersubjective understandings.

Existing Explanations of Interstate Conflict and the Role of Norms

Two existing literatures are built on here, firstly, the broad
democratic peace literature, including its offshoots and opponents, and
secondly, scholarship on the evolution of international norms. The
former literature initially focused upon regime type, and over time has
been widened to include more fine-grained analyses of domestic political
structures in any state (Bell and Quek 2018; Fearon 1994; Gries et al.
2020; Huth and Allee 2002; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020; Weeks 2012;
Weiss 2013; Weiss and Dafoe 2019). However, the approach in all of these
works is to examine structures, that is, formal institutional
constraints encountered by decision makers, rather than norms, that is,
the role of shared principles, perceptions and expectations of behavior.
The distinction between norms and structure is not rigid. This is most
clearly seen in the term "institution" which is commonly used to mean
both formal structures which limit the agency of decision makers, but
also a set of norms, rules, and practices which govern a specific area.
To clarify the distinction being made in this article, I adapt the
nomenclature used by Reus-Smit (1999) who distinguishes between
constitutional institutions, norms without which a society of states
could not exist, and fundamental institutions, which facilitate
cooperation. The former includes sovereignty, as well as the rights of
self-determination and nonintervention, and the latter contractual
international law and the organizations which enforce it (both internal
and external to states). In this article, I term the former "norms" and
the latter "structures."

The democratic peace literature has spurred several offshoots, the most
relevant of which are those which have argued that rather than regime
type the "peace" is generated by economic factors including trade
interdependency and level of development (Gartzke 2007; Hegre 2000; Kim
2014; Kinne 2012; McDonald 2009, 2010; Mousseau 2013; Schneider and
Gleditsch 2010) or shared intergovernmental organization membership
(Appel 2018; Kinne 2013a, 2013b; Prorok and Appel 2014). More general
critiques have argued that any effect seen is due to the prior
settlement of territorial disputes (Gibler 2012; Gibler and Tir 2014;
Owsiak 2012), nuclear weapons (Waltz 1990), alliances (Kydd 2005),
unipolarity (Monteiro 2014) or military power (Layne 1994; Rosato 2003)
instead. With the exception of the latter critiques, this debate has
broadly accepted the importance of norms (Doyle 1986; Moravcsik 1997;
Owen 1994; Russett and Oneal 2001), especially as the "good" functioning
of domestic and international structures, particularly veto players,
requires political actors to have the right norms.

This relationship between norms and structures has been more closely
addressed through the focus on contracts, that is, to hone in on
specific economic norms and structures characterized as allowing an
economic market to function "with extensive and regularized transactions
among strangers that require an element of trust" (Mousseau and Xiongwei
2018, sec. Emergence Contractualist Peace). This literature argues that
the relationship between peace and democracy is spurious, and rather,
that both are explained by "contracturalist" norms and structures (Gelpi
and Grieco 2008; Mousseau, Hegre, and O'Neal 2003), which builds upon
the work of (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Dahl 1997; North, Wallis, and
Weingast 2009). Yet, the literature still relies upon
operationalizations which are essentially structural, that is, whilst
recognizing the importance of norms, the empirical testing has fallen
short.

A comparatively small subset of the literature has examined norms as an
explanation for the democratic peace. For Deutsch (1957), [[though
**NATO** is understood as a **structure**, a **security community** is
**more crucially** formed around **shared values**]{.mark}
(norms)]{.underline}. [Kahl argues that [the **basis** of]{.mark} the
democratic [**peace** is **collective identity**]{.mark} rooted in
liberal democracy **[interlinked by intergovernmental
organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (1998). For Risse, the influence of
NATO allies upon the foreign policy of the United States demonstrates
the importance of liberal norms, through a mechanism which relies upon
the similarity of domestic political institutions in these liberal
democracies and coalition-building (1995). Though valuable additions to
the literature, and in Deutsch's case systematic in its treatment of the
subject, these works fail to tackle the question of whether the
democratic peace is structural or norm based since the two are entwined
throughout. The difficulty in conceptualizing, isolating and
operationalizing norms is a clear problem. Broadly, it is hard to
isolate a norm from either the structure in which it exists or from
other norms for analysis. It is also a challenge to show that any norm
is truly intersubjective in understanding or to measure its effect upon
some outcome of interest. Yet, without attempts to do so we are left
with a partial picture, particularly for those emphasizing the
importance of structures---be these domestic or international---for
reducing interstate conflict. In short, the existence of a domestic
legislature, independent judiciary, or interstate treaties, is only
relevant if the individuals which employ them do so appropriately. To
understand this necessitates exploring the ideas in the heads of these
individuals, and particularly, how these ideas are shared.

In contrast to the large, predominantly quantitative, literature which
has examined the democratic peace and wider questions linking regime
type to the onset, conduct and termination of interstate disputes and
wars, the broader literature on interstate norms has tended to be
qualitative and highly focused. This has resulted in detailed work on
human rights (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), humanitarian intervention
(Wheeler 2000), and nuclear weapons (Rublee and Cohen 2018; Tannenwald
1999). There is no doubt that this has contributed to our understanding
of interstate relations, yet the clear shortcoming is generalizability.
That is, the specificity of these approaches, necessary to make any form
of causal claim, is in a sense also the undoing.

In this article I focus on the reinterpretation of the sovereignty norm
by powerful states. I argue that they have a dominant role in shaping
the normative landscape of the international system by being tasked with
the interpretation of norms and the maintenance of international society
(Hurrell 2007; Wight 1978; Saunders 2006). Operationalizing this, I
utilize UN Security Council resolutions as a means of assessing what the
consensus position of the permanent members is. Content analysis is used
to examine the normative framing of resolutions, allowing both an
exploration of change over time, and quantitative measures of the
relative strength of these ideas to be derived which can then be used in
regression analysis.

The Constraining Effect of Liberal Interpretations of Sovereignty

Norms are dynamic, and undergo processes of evolution, creation and
destruction. Change may occur gradually as actors shift their
understandings towards an alternative, or suddenly through systemic, and
thereby social, change. In international relations, the latter is
tightly linked to sudden shifts in great power authority, which has
typically occurred due to defeat and a subsequent realignment of
international order. War, and its aftermath, can lead to substantial
rearrangements of international order, meaning both a new distribution
of power, but also a re-interpretation of international society. In
examining change in understandings of sovereignty I term gradual change
"evolution" and sudden change "tectonic."

Interpretations of Sovereignty

The post-World War Two era allows examination of both evolutionary and
tectonic change in understandings of sovereignty. Evolution occurs
during relative peace, whilst tectonic change is part of major
realignments of international order. The end of the Cold War, though
non-violent certainly led to significant power shifts, resulting in a
tectonic change. The pre- and post-Cold War eras are eras of evolution.
Assessing rivalrous interpretation of norms is crucial to understanding
these changes. I outline a divergence between traditional and liberal
interpretations which are used to examine change in norms, and the
effect upon international conflict.

Over the post-World War Two period two interpretations of sovereignty
have existed, firstly, that emphasizing territorial sovereignty and
non-interference in the domestic affairs of others, and secondly, that
emphasizing international law, interdependence, free trade, democracy
and individual rights and freedoms in international affairs. I term the
former approach to sovereignty "traditional," and the latter "liberal."
A liberal interpretation of sovereignty, therefore, is one which places
emphasis upon the actions of states, particularly those between a
government and its citizens. Sovereignty in this understanding implies
not only the exercise of power over a territory and people (as in the
traditional understanding), but also that there are limits to the
exercise of power and duties to a people (Sandholtz and Stiles 2008,
287-88).3 This has been most clearly stated in the Responsibility to
Protect doctrine. I examine the relative balance between these two
interpretations over time, arguing that this balance alters how
sovereignty is understood, and thereby is related to the likelihood of
escalation in interstate disputes.

My expectation is that the relative balance between these two modes of
interpretation has shifted over the post-World War Two period to favor a
liberal interpretation. This does not mean that traditional
interpretations are irrelevant, rather, that they have been
de-emphasized in international discourse relative to the latter. A
spectrum in which purely traditional and purely liberal interpretations
mark the poles is conceived of as existing, with great powers occupying
positions between the two. The effect that this shift toward a liberal
interpretation of sovereignty has occurred on international conflict
escalation is now examined.

Understandings of Sovereignty and Conflict Escalation

How understandings of sovereignty impact international disputes may be
explored in terms of the conflict life-cycle, that is, why a dispute
emerges, why violent conflict breaks out, and how the conflict ends, or
in terms of participant conduct during war. Here, I examine the effect
of change in the collective understanding of sovereignty upon
escalation, meaning that I assume the prior existence of international
disputes. Whilst the effect of norms upon the onset of disputes is an
important question, very few disputes result in the use of violence,
that is, though onset is a necessary condition for violence, it is far
from sufficient. I examine escalation from a nonviolent dispute to a
violent dispute---the use of armed force in international
relations---because this is of greater substantive significance to state
leaders and their citizens. Moreover, whilst reducing the likelihood of
dispute onset would likely result in less international violence, the
more normatively important question is how to avoid escalation, as this
reduces the costs of war: human death and economic destruction.

This is not to trivialize dispute onset, and logically we might expect
the growth of liberal understandings of sovereignty to also reduce onset
rates as well as escalation likelihood. However, there are two reasons
why we may doubt the substantive significance of this, firstly, dispute
onset is a relatively low threshold, and secondly, onset is often
triggered by events beyond the direct control of a state. To this first
point, a dispute simply means that two or more actors disagree over
something, oftentimes the behavior of the other side or the distribution
of some good (for instance, territory). This article utilizes
Militarized Interstate Disputes as the operationalization of dispute,
and many disputes are comparatively minor events, with the threshold
being that one of the two parties has a minimum level of militarization
as part of the dispute (for example, the issuance of a deterrent, or
compellent, threat). A focus on onset, therefore, would prevent
observation of substantively more important actions, that is, the actual
use of force against another. Secondly, many disputes begin due to
accident and/or the decision making of low-level military commanders or
political officials who are neither in the position to consider national
interests nor strategic interactions. This means that onset may
essentially be an apolitical decision which takes little or no account
of the broader strategic landscape nor the structural and normative
context. It is after onset, that is, when escalation is considered by
policymakers, that the stakes are higher and when causal mechanisms
common to this topic are most active.

Escalation then, is a political decision. [In making the **choice to
escalate**, or not, policymakers are impacted by a range of strategic
factors, but **crucially**, are also **constrained by norms**. The
[**use of force** in **i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations
**[must be justified]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and since 1945 the UN
Charter specifies just two: self-defense and collective peace
enforcement. To this, we might also add humanitarian intervention,
though this remains contested. As a baseline, therefore, when faced with
dispute onset, policymakers must justify their actions with reference to
one of these reasons. Moreover, [[in making the **decision to
escalate**, policymakers are]{.mark} also [**constrained by liberal
values** which]{.mark} emphasize diplomacy, cooperation, international
law, international organizations, the rights of the individual, and to
[**question the legitimacy** of]{.mark} the march to **[war]{.mark}**.
Taken together, [this **slows the decision to escalate**, since **legal
justification is needed**, **diplomacy is necessary**, and]{.mark}
potential **[economic and human costs]{.mark}** understood,
**[calculated]{.mark}** and defended]{.underline}. [[A **shift toward
liberal interpretations**]{.mark} thereby [means]{.mark} a **[reduced
probability of escalation to violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, tacitly
assuming that the risk of a dispute arising in the first-place is
unchanged. This leads me to my first hypothesis, which relates to the
evolution mechanism of change:

Hypothesis 1: [Given an international dispute, the risk of **escalation
decreases as liberal interpretations increase**]{.underline}.

[An alternative explanation is that any impact of normative change is
actually a result of the end of the Cold War, that is, the
redistribution of power between great powers]{.underline}, typically
resulting from system-wide conflict [results in qualitative differences
in interpretations of fundamental norms]{.underline} between
peace-periods. Whilst the end of the Cold War did not involve a
system-wide war, it did mark the end of sustained rivalry between great
powers. The pre- and post- periods can thereby be compared. Given the
rivalry of the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and
the relative dominance of the United States post-Cold War, we might
expect qualitative differences in conflict behavior to be observable in
the two time periods, attributable, perhaps, to a greater emphasis upon
liberal interpretations in the post-Cold War era. The dramatic [change
in the distribution of power triggered a significant change in the
consensus surrounding interpretation of fundamental norms of
international society]{.underline}. This leads me to my second
hypothesis, which captures the tectonic change mechanism:

Hypothesis 2: [The risk of dispute **escalation decreases** given a
**systemic increase in liberal interpretations** of sovereignty
attributable to the end of the Cold War]{.underline}.

5.2. The Consequences of Non-Intervention

The War on Terror has raised concerns over the future of the practise of
humanitarian intervention. Indeed [it would seem [the **liberal
agenda**]{.mark}, despite its ideological foundations of universalism
and cosmopolitanism, [has **exhausted what little political will and
strategic capabilities existed for**]{.mark} **true humanitarian
[intervention]{.mark} in the pursuit of Western security** in an
increasingly insecure world]{.underline}. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to respond to the ever darkening cloud the War on Terror is casting over
humanitarian intervention by [**[dismissing the practise
entirely]{.mark}** is to [render a **valuable instrument**]{.mark} in
the protection of human rights as **[undeservedly
useless]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Heinze 2006: 31). Proponents of
humanitarian intervention have argued that [[those who
**dismiss**]{.mark} humanitarian [**intervention** as]{.mark} simply [a
**vehicle through which liberal regimes**]{.mark} wish to
**[extend]{.mark} their [control]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} ―**[condemning
other people to death]{.mark}**]{.underline}‖ (Rieff 1999) [and ―leaving
the innocent to suffer the world over]{.underline}‖ (Ramos-Horta 2005:
284) through being overtly politically correct. It is difficult to
counter such arguments when we consider the consequences of
nonintervention in Rwanda, as well as the consequences of intervention
where political commitment to the cause is lacking, as was the case with
the Srebenica massacre. Such [morally abhorrent events were allowed to
happen as a direct consequence of a lack of strategic interest for the
states with the power to intervene]{.underline}, and have led to
commentators such as Richard Just to argue that [despite the
controversies the War on Terror has wrought upon the practise of
humanitarian intervention, to respond by saying that it is wrong for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to intervene to spread its own
moral universal values is to condemn the interventions in Bosnia and
Kosovo which stopped ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide, and to
agree with the decision not to intervene in Rwanda as right]{.underline}
(Just 2005: 212), [a position which most would find morally
unacceptable]{.underline}. Here then we can clearly see the crux of the
problem, in that [non-intervention is intolerable, but humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}, as has clearly been demonstrated in previous
chapters, [remains impossible]{.underline} (**[Falk]{.underline}** 1993:
757).

[[Such a problematic]{.mark} of humanitarian intervention [requires
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline} if future human rights atrocities are
to be halted, and [[if the unchecked spread of liberal technologies of
governance]{.mark} and control [is to be challenged]{.mark}. [It is
**not enough simply to denounce**]{.mark} humanitarian intervention as
reflecting only the **[imperial interests]{.mark}** of ˑpowerful western
governments]{.underline}, as ex-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
highlighted when he posed the question, ―If humanitarian intervention
is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, [**how should we
respond** to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica---to gross and systematic
violations of human rights that offend every precept of our common
humanity?]{.underline}‖ (Annan 2000) Even if one were to argue for an
absolute rule of non-intervention so as to avoid abuse of the
humanitarian sentiment by liberal regimes, [one need only look at the
interventions in Kosovo and Iraq to note that international
legitimization is not a necessary precursor to liberal
intervention]{.underline}. Given the power Western liberal states have
to override international legal norms to intervene in situations which
threaten their interests and security, and given the fact that there
exists many parts of the world where the humanitarian situation remains
intolerable, [to respond to the liberal crusade towards intervention by
calling for a steadfast rule of non-intervention is [**not only
impossible**, but]{.mark} **also [immoral]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

The debate over the legitimacy and conduct of humanitarian intervention
continues to rage fiercely within the international community,
particularly in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the declaration of
the War on Terror. From growing calls for more humanitarian action and
political involvement to solve the humanitarian crises of the 90s, to
international scepticism and condemnation of the liberal interventions
in the Middle East following the events of 9/11, it comes as no surprise
that humanitarian intervention is generally deemed to be ―in crisis‖
(Rieff 2002). As this essay has demonstrated, the waning of state
sovereignty and the subsequent rise in humanitarian' interventions has
been an emergent reality throughout the 1990s; yet far from being the
result of a growing humanism amongst the powerful liberal states, such a
shift in concern from the state to the individual is in reality part of
a much more sinister liberal enterprise which is quintessentially
concerned with the art of global governance (Gordon 1991: 14). The
repercussions of the implication of liberal self- interests alongside
the achievement of humanitarian goals has been highlighted only too
clearly in an analysis of the development of humanitarian intervention
throughout the 1990s, during which time it became painfully clear that
intervention undertaken for purely humanitarian concerns, if it occurs
at all, has generally been underfunded and insufficient (Falk 2000:
333), therefore leading to interventions which arguably did more harm
than good. Rwanda provides us with a clear example of what happens when,
despite grave humanitarian concerns, there exists no strategic interests
for the states with the power to intervene, whilst events in Somalia,
Bosnia and Kosovo illustrated the fact that in the absence of state
self-interest, there exists little political will to pay the costs of
blood and gold in order to ensure that ―humanitarian war is conducted in
a humanitarian manner.‖ (Falk 2000: 331) The 1990s then, far from being
the ‗golden era of humanitarian intervention' (Bellamy and Wheeler
2008), were in reality an experimentation in liberal expansionism, yet
where there existed few security concerns for the liberal states, there
existed little political will to commit to the mission. It is only when
national interests are implicated that states are willing to accept the
costs and stay the duration necessary to alter the humanitarian
situation in any meaningful way (Weiss 2004: 37).

As has been noted throughout this essay, [the vital interests of the
intervening states are grounded in liberal notions of human security;
that is to say **[entire swathes of the world]{.mark}'s population [are
re-conceptualized as a threat to humanity]{.mark} which requires
pacification through assimilation into the liberal world order or,
failing that, destruction**]{.underline}. [In liberalisms quest to
expand its control and influence across the world, the remit of
intervention has been broadened to include within its scope democracy
spreading, nation building, and regime change, as has been demonstrated
in Iraq, Afghanistan, and more recently, Libya]{.underline}. [**It would
seem [undeniable that humanitarian intervention is]{.mark} essentially
[a veil]{.mark} behind which liberal imperialism can disguise itself**,
despite protestations of liberals heralding a ―revolution of moral
concern]{.underline}‖. Indeed, we can see clear similarities between the
old rhetoric of empire and current discussions surrounding liberal
imperialism. As Nardin has noted, in the old days of empire
humanitarianism was used to justify the imposition of foreign power on
populations at the margins of the ‗civilized' world in order to uphold
the standards of civilized morality; essentially in order to protect the
population from themselves. We can see that little has changed between
then and now when we note that current rhetoric on humanitarian
intervention constructs the third world as a threat to itself and to the
rest of the world, and therefore the barbarity of tyranny and terrorism
that these ‗uncivilized' regions breed ―must be countered, in the name
of humanity, by the exercise of imperial power‖ (Nardin 2006: 25). In
construing humanitarian intervention as liberal imperialism, the motives
behind liberal intervention become clearer, in that essentially liberal
regimes wish to subjugate and impose indirect control on those portions
of the population securitization discourse has constructed as a threat
to global security. Whilst it is true that the days of territorial
expansion are over, what we are experiencing now is by no means a waning
of imperial ambition, as through the spread of liberal values and the
imposition of liberal structures, through force if necessary, liberalism
is extending its ‗universal' values across the world, justifying any
means by the end which is indisputably morally right (Bishai 2004: 51).

Indeed, as was highlighted in chapter four, there exists a significant
cognitive dissonance between liberal universalism, with its proclaimed
notions of a cosmopolitan humanitarianism, and liberal imperialism,
which finds its expression through intervention which is justified on a
humanitarian basis, yet which in reality functions through the
eradication or exclusion of all life forms which do not conform to
liberalism (McCarthy 2009: 166). It would seem that the obvious
conclusion to draw would be one which wholly condemns the practise of
humanitarian intervention as a front for the furthering of a liberal
ideology which functions through the subjugation of morally inferior'
populations so as to extend its own remit of control and power.
Humanitarian intervention is less about a moral concern for the
suffering of people, than a method through which Western liberal states
can secure their own populations from a global imaginary of threat.
[**[Yet such a damning analysis]{.mark} of liberal intervention [is
incomplete]{.mark}, as it [fails to give]{.mark} a [sufficient analysis
of the effects these interventions have on]{.mark} the
[populations]{.mark} concerned, [not to mention the effects
non-intervention could have on those populations]{.mark} suffering**
human rights abuses]{.underline}. **[Of course a proclaimed interest in
saving strangers' will only ever be put into action when the strategic
interests of liberal states are at stake]{.underline}**, meaning liberal
cries of a duty to intervene' and a responsibility to protect' in those
situations that shock the moral conscience of mankind must be regarded
with scepticism. Such [**[scepticism]{.mark}**, however, **[should not
be translated into an absolute rule]{.mark}** of nonintervention, as to
do so would be **[to turn our backs]{.mark}** completely **[on the
suffering of those that need our help, in whatever form such help may
come in]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, the spread of liberal
imperialism does not necessarily signify the death of humanitarian
sentiments; rather the two can coincide, and when they do, a greater
window of opportunity is created for those wishing to act on the
humanitarian impulse]{.underline} in the Security Council (Weiss 2004:
37).

When we consider the globalizing effect the War on Terror has had on
liberal intervention, however, as we move further into the new
millennium it is becoming ever clearer that liberal intervention is
being stretched to its limits. Ten years after the invasion of
Afghanistan and eight years after the invasion of Iraq, 99,000 and
46,000 US troops remained in each country respectively (New York Times
2011), highlighting the extensive nature of the liberal imperial mission
in the aftermath of 9/11. The ‗unending war' against terrorism seems to
have taken its toll on Western liberal states capacity to intervene,
meaning that, rather than coinciding, the requirements of the war
against terrorism will have to be balanced against the more distant
demands of humanity (Macfarlane et al 2007: 985), and it is not
difficult to work out which will prevail. Indeed, since the coming to
power of the Bush administration in 2001, humanitarian intervention
where no national interests were at stake has been dismissed as
―blunting the purpose of the military‖ (Ignatieff 2003), yet quite
paradoxically Bush pinned continuing support for the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan on humanitarian rhetoric regarding nation-building and the
promotion of democracy for the Afghan and Iraqi people. In doing so it
would seem that the US has manipulated the idea of a responsibility to
protect to include a much broader remit for intervention, embracing not
just the ―responsibility to react‖ but the ―responsibility to prevent‖
and the ―responsibility to rebuild‖ as well (Evans and Sahnoun 2002:
101), stretching the language of humanitarianism to suit liberalisms own
political agenda. As has been evidenced by the growing disillusionment
with the on-going operations in the Middle East in which thousands of
western troops have been killed, the continued threat of terrorist
attacks, and more recently the lack of political support for further
meaningful interventions in Libya and Syria, it would seem that liberal
interventionism has not only lost sight of the universal humanitarian
notions that lie at its roots, but is struggling to retain its
omnipotence in the face of widespread opposition to the invasions in
Iraq and Afghanistan. Whilst the 9/11 attacks may have had a 'rally
round the flag' effect within the US, the most ardent exporter of
international liberalism, it has had the opposite effect across the rest
of the international community, which has sought to distance itself from
the aggressively Western liberal interventionist stance that provoked
such terrorist attacks (Ignatieff 2003).

All things considered, it would seem that Fukuyama's prediction in 1992
that the rise to predominance of Western liberal democracy would signal
the ‗End of History' in that it would become the universal and final
form of human government (Fukuyama 1992) is increasingly being
challenged. The rise in militant Islam and terrorist attacks against the
West highlights inescapably that the proclaimed universal moral
righteousness of the liberal mission is in reality far from universal,
whilst the rising spectre of China as the new superpower on the
international stage could diminish Western liberalisms power and
influence in years to come. This being said, [the reality remains that,
for now at least, Western liberal regimes retain hegemony on the global
stage, and therefore hegemony in decisions to intervene or
not]{.underline}. As we have seen, liberal humanitarian' intervention is
deeply flawed; oftentimes the primary motives for intervention are far
from humanitarian, and there is much resentment in the international
community regarding the omnipotence of the Western liberal states
wishing to impose their world view on weaker states. What is more, the
War on Terror has only exemplified such concerns, highlighting the way
in which [liberal states have manipulated humanitarian sentiments to
justify intervention with other motives]{.underline} (Ayoob 2002) [and
allowed liberalism to broaden its scope of expansion
globally]{.underline} (**[Evans 2010]{.underline}**). [**Yet the reality
is that** liberal intervention, however imperfect and unpalatable it may
be is currently the only choice the international community has if it is
to avoid another Rwanda, or another Srebenica, to avoid once again
becoming a bystander to genocide]{.underline}. As we have seen, **[where
no other interests exist, attempts at humanitarianism will
flounder]{.underline}**. [To argue for intervention motivated by purely
humanitarian motives and conducted in a completely humanitarian manner
is to ignore the realities of the world in which we live. The reality is
that]{.underline}, as Weiss quite succinctly put it, [the rise to
predominance of **[liberal imperialism]{.mark}** and the resultant
convergence of humanitarian values and liberal security interests ―[has
**not** brought **utopia**, **but** made the world a]{.mark} somewhat
**[more liveable place than it would have been
otherwise]{.mark}**]{.underline}‖ (2001: 104). Whether this remains the
case in the aftermath of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in a
seemingly endless War against Terror, and in a world where Western
liberalism is increasingly feeling threatened yet where political
support and capacity for liberal intervention is low, remains to be
seen.

Conclusion

This article has examined genealogy as a form of critique in IR. The
first part of the article demonstrated that Foucault's [genealogy was an
important component in]{.underline} the work of the first generation of
[**[post-structuralist IR]{.mark}** as well as in contemporary
scholarship [informed by]{.mark} frameworks of governmentality and
**[biopolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It was shown that [when genealogy
is understood as critique, violence risks being inscribed as
foundational to global political life]{.underline}. However, despite the
fact that it is virtually impossible to understand the meaning of
"critical" in this work without a grasp of genealogy, the assumptions of
genealogy have been insufficiently engaged. To rectify this, the second
part of the article critically examined the philosophical underpinnings
of genealogy. Through a close reading of three core texts where Foucault
grapples with genealogy, it was shown that [genealogy relies on an
**ontology of forces**, which are postulated as **arbitrarily and
violently related**. Genealogy therefore tends to **inscribe violence as
foundational to social relations**]{.underline}. It was further noted
that [genealogically informed critique brings a peculiar form of
suspicion to all that is presented as common, shared, and
universal]{.underline}. This suspicion was traced back to Nietzsche and
characterized as "baseless," [which again reflects a set of particular
ontological commitments idiosyncratic to genealogy]{.underline}. [These
commitments, which inscribe violence as foundational, were]{.underline}
finally [**contrasted to** an **ontology** which follows the
genealogical understanding of emergent forces, but **refuses the
assumption** of them as **arbitrarily and violently
related**]{.underline}.

Finally, what are the implications for empirical Foucauldian work for
the argument I have pursued in the article? [In **empirical work**
informed by governmentality and **biopolitics**, IR scholars often
[examine the **encounter between Western and non-Western
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The problem]{.underline} to which I
ultimately want to draw attention [is not that such scholarship is often
critical of military intervention undertaken by Western
powers]{.underline}. On the contrary, it is important to bring out and
critically scrutinize the paternalistic and indeed hierarchical
renditions that no doubt are common in, for instance, the liberal peace
project (e.g. Richmond, 2011). [The problem is rather that the
genealogical ethos risks **turning into a global interpretive
disposition, with which all global interactions by whatever means are
made a priori suspect**. [Instead of seeking]{.mark} to engage in a
**careful [empirical consideration of the merits of forms of
intervention in each case]{.mark}**, [the **generalized**]{.mark}
**genealogical [suspicion]{.mark} \[[hinders]{.mark}\] disables [any
other understanding of global political life than]{.mark} a
[ceaseless]{.mark} unfolding drama of [clashing wills to
dominate]{.mark} and conquer**]{.underline}. [Since the liberal project
is exposed as just a particular will to power, it must inscribe a
relation of violent hierarchy to non-Western localities, as opposed to
an understanding of similar and harmoniously overlapping subjectivities
already existing in those places]{.underline}. On such a
pre-methodological genealogical disposition, [[**intervention becomes
suspicious in whatever form it may take**. Whether]{.mark} it is in the
form of [**peacekeeping troops** or]{.mark} rule of law advisors
**[assisting]{.mark} local actors [in security sector reform]{.mark}**,
**any involvement [can only be read as a manifestation of "the West's"
ongoing will to colonize]{.mark}** and impose its will on
others]{.underline}.

The genealogical disposition easily lends itself to an assertion of
incommensurability, more often than not coded in terms of "culture,"
since the clashing wills to power in Foucault's ontology of emergence do
not belong to a common space; they have nothing in common. [[What
is]{.mark} made suspect to the extent of \[[hindered]{.mark}\] disabled
[is]{.mark} genuine **[social learning through communication]{.mark}**,
which presupposes that different sociocultural settings may display
profound similarities of aspirations of what is desired]{.underline}.
For instance, holding out the possibility that whatever goes under the
label of human rights, and especially its minimalist rendition of what
human means, is compatible with a range of walks and ways, may
harmoniously blend with, and may resonate with many traditions around
the world is perhaps the ultimate hope on which the liberal peace
project rests (e.g. Moyn, 2010). This hope, however, is disabled
\[hindered\] by a peculiar form of genealogical faith which lures the
researcher to interpret all human interaction as disguising a ceaseless
and primordial clash of wills to power.

Following the argument pursued in this article, [one needs to realize
that the **genealogical disposition** is reflective of certain
**ontological assumptions** which **are but one option**. Empirical work
in IR informed by governmentality frameworks is no doubt valuable in
that such work opens up for a much more extensive power analysis than
approaches that reify state actors as the only relevant actors in global
politics]{.underline}. Moreover, Foucault's writings on biopolitics have
served as a starting point for examining what happens when life rather
than territory become the object of rule, thus broadening the
traditional focus in IR to include geopolitics and biopolitics (e.g.
Vaughan-Williams, 2015). [However]{.underline}, when conducting
empirical work in such traditions, [[it is **important to refrain from
reading an ontology of violence into**]{.mark} **the [empirical
analyses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or at the very least, reflect on the
ethico-political stakes involved in doing so.

#### No "liberal wars"

David **Chandler 9**, Professor of IR at University of Westminster,
\"Liberal War and Foucaultian Metaphysics\", Review of Dillon and Reid's
*The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live*,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars]{.mark} and conflicts [but]{.mark} to [an
abstract model]{.mark} of conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire
to'remove war from the life of humanity'which'derives from the way in
which liberalism takes the life of the species as its referent object of
politics ─ biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of
war very much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that [the distinctiveness of ']{.mark}the
[liberal]{.mark} way of [war]{.mark}' which they seek to explore [cannot
be more than a fool's quest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They assert that
they will critically uncover the paradox of liberal war: why it is that
Realist or geostrategic war accepts the necessity of war but attempts to
limit it, while liberals wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to
fight unlimited wars. Yet, they admit that **[[this starting point
is]{.mark} already [an ideological dead end]{.mark}]{.underline}** [─
the [wars of the twentieth century give the lie to the]{.mark} idea that
there is some [distinction between 'unending crusades' and 'limited
jousts]{.mark} between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
[alleged]{.mark} to be fought differently to geo-political wars for
territory, because the '[drivers' of war are]{.mark} not territorialized
interests but the biopolitical [framings of the]{.mark} needs of the
[human]{.mark}, how human life can and should be lived.]{.underline}
[Inevitably [there are **insuperable methodological hurdles** to
this]{.mark} Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already, [there occurs the
first fundamental aporia: [how do we tell the difference between a
liberal and non-liberal war?]{.mark}]{.underline} [There appears to be
no way of preventing the category of liberal war from becoming a
lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought biopolitically
only if we are told that these are the motives by those fighting
them]{.underline}.¶ **[[This separation of liberal ways of war from
territorialised framings]{.mark} of geostrategic contestation [makes
little sense]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as a framework for
understanding]{.underline} either liberal rule or liberal ways of
[war]{.underline}. In fact, [in defining liberal war in this way the
connection between liberal rule and war is entirely
severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions also be
geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [[It would appear]{.mark} that
[every form of rule]{.mark} and of war [has]{.mark} at least [an
implicit view of the 'human']{.mark} and through this view of the human
the form of rule and the way of war are rationalized. [There is
not]{.mark} and cannot be [anything]{.mark} specifically ['liberal'
about this]{.mark}]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing,
through war on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's
stoic cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[[The]{.mark} key starting [assumption]{.mark},
that [the liberal way of war can be isolated]{.mark} from any other -
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** its alleged specific form, of '**[[unending
violence', explained by its referent]{.mark} of the human -
[appears]{.mark} to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
[unproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction
at which Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that
would help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

### AT: ! -- Structural Root Causes

#### They have everything backwards -- no structural root causes -- AND radical transformation wouldn't solve -- BUT proximate focus does

John **Horgan 14**. Director of the Center for Science Writings at
Stevens Institute of Technology, "To End War, Focus on Culture Rather
than \"Root Causes\"", Scientific American, 8-18,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/to-end-war-focus-on-culture-rather-than-root-causes/

When I started researching war, [I]{.underline} also [assumed that to
get rid of war, we have to get rid of its root causes. The trouble is,
[scholars]{.mark} have [identified countless causes of war]{.mark}. One
pseudo-explanation]{.underline} (which I\'m glad Kloor does not mention,
and which I rebut early on in my book and in posts such as this) [is
that war stems from]{.underline} a compulsion bred into our ancestors by
natural selection. [Biology]{.underline} underpins war, as it underpins
all human behaviors. The crucial question is, why does war break out in
certain places and times and not others? [The most popular
non-biological explanations]{.underline} of war [are]{.underline} what I
call [the **Malthusian** and **Marxist** hypotheses. The
first]{.underline} posits [that war stems from our tendency to
over-reproduce and hence fight over land and other resources. The second
holds that war stems from inequality, the tendency of societies
(especially capitalist ones) to divide into haves and
have-nots]{.underline}. [[Scholars]{.mark} have]{.underline} also
[[blamed]{.mark} wars on [**religion**, **racism** and
**nationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Kloor mentions above, [[as
well as]{.mark} such **fundamental [social traits]{.mark}** as
hierarchy, sexism and injustice. [If you **cherry pick**, you]{.mark}
**always [find evidence]{.mark}** to support your favorite
theory]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} as scholars]{.underline} such as
Lewis Fry Richardson (whom my friend David Berreby recently profiled)
[have shown]{.underline}, neither the Malthusian and Marxist theories
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**r any of the other **[[explanations]{.mark}
above can [account for the]{.mark} vast [diversity of
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, [some factors that provoke
conflict]{.underline}, such as religion, [can also inhibit
it]{.underline}. Religion has inspired some of our greatest antiwar
leaders, notably Gandhi and Martin Luther King. I have found [only one
theory of war that fits the facts]{.underline}. The theory holds [that
[war]{.mark} is a self-perpetuating, contagious meme, which [can
propagate **independently of**]{.mark} **other [social]{.mark} and
environmental [factors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As anthropologist
Margaret Mead put it in a famous 1940 essay, \"Warfare Is Only an
Invention---Not a Biological Necessity.\" In other words, the major
cause of war is war itself, which has a terrible tendency to spread even
to societies that would prefer to remain peaceful. I make this point in
my book and in a 2010 blog post, \"Margaret Mead's war theory kicks butt
of neo-Darwinian and Malthusian models.\" Here is an edited excerpt: In
his 1997 book War Before Civilization, anthropologist Lawrence Keeley
notes that war among North American Indians often stemmed from the
aggression of just a few extremely warlike tribes, \"rotten apples that
spoiled their regional barrels.\" He added, \"Less aggressive societies,
stimulated by more warlike groups in their vicinity, become more
bellicose themselves.\" Societies in a violent region, the political
scientist Azar Gat emphasizes in his 2006 book War in Human
Civilization, have a strong incentive to carry out preemptive attacks.
Societies may \"attack the other side in order to eliminate or severely
weaken them as a potential enemy. Indeed, this option only makes the
other side more insecure, rendering the security dilemma more acute. War
can thus become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of war breeds
war.\" [[Many]{.mark} people [are **pessimistic**]{.mark} about ending
war because [they assume it will require **radical**]{.mark} **social
[engineering]{.mark}**. World peace will require eliminating poverty,
inequality, sexism, **racism** or **\[fill in the
blank\]**.]{.underline} We will need to eradicate religion, or all
embrace the same religion. We will need to get rid of all nation states
and become anarchists, or form a single global government. [My
analysis]{.underline} of war [suggests that if we want to end war, **[we
don\'t need]{.mark} to create [a society radically different]{.mark}**
from our own, let alone a utopia. If we want to end war, we should
[focus on ending war]{.mark}]{.underline} and the culture of war
[[rather than]{.mark} on **[supposed causal factors]{.mark}**. If we can
do that, [we will **take a major step toward solving
many**]{.mark}]{.underline} of our **[[other]{.mark} social
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as I argued in my previous post. And
that brings me to Keith Kloor\'s final challenge to me. He devotes much
of his column to a discussion of how extremists on both sides of the
conflict between Israel and Palestine have \"hijacked the peace process.
Horrific spasmodic cycles of violence and death is the result.\" He asks
me how we can \"rid the world of extremist groups that sow the seeds of
war.\" [Kloor [has]{.mark}]{.underline} his [**[causation
backwards]{.mark}**. Just as [war promotes]{.mark} poverty, tyranny,
[inequality]{.mark} and resource depletion **[at least as much as vice
versa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so war promotes fanaticism. Once
militarism seizes hold of a society, it can transform vast populations
into virtual sociopaths. It turns decent, ethical, reasonable people
into intolerant fanatics capable of the most heinous acts. [Breaking out
of]{.underline} what Kloor calls \"spasmodic [cycles of
violence]{.underline} and death\" [can be]{.underline} extraordinarily
[difficult, but history offers many examples of societies that have done
just that. Germany and France were bitter, bloody rivals for centuries.
But it is now inconceivable that Germany and France]{.underline}---or
any members of the European Union\--[would go to war]{.underline}
against each other. [One of my favorite examples of a nation that has
renounced militarism is Costa Rica]{.underline}. Like many of its
neighbors in Central American, Costa was once wracked by terrible
violence. But [after a bloody civil war in the 1940s, Costa Rica
disbanded its army]{.underline}, freeing up more funds for education,
health care, transportation and tourism. It is often ranked as one of
the most peaceful, healthy, \"happy\" nations in the world.

### AT: ! -- Value To Life

#### Value to life is inevitable and subjective -- their assertions are the only scenario for negative value

The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a
criterion for decisionmaking is closely related to the first, but with
an added dimension. This assertion suggests that [the [determination
of]{.mark} the [value of]{.mark} the quality of a given [life is a
subjective determination to be made by the person experiencing that
life]{.mark}]{.underline}. The important addition here is that the
decision is a personal one that, ideally, ought not to be made
externally by another person but internally by the individual involved.
Katherine Lewis made this decision for herself based on a comparison
between two stages of her life. So did James Brady. [Without this
element, [decisions based on quality]{.mark} of life criteria
[lack]{.mark} salient [information]{.mark}]{.underline} and the patients
concerned cannot give informed consent. [Patients must be given the
opportunity to decide for themselves whether they think their lives are
worth living or not. [To ignore]{.mark} or overlook patients'
[judgement]{.mark} in this matter [is to violate]{.mark}]{.underline}
their autonomy and [their freedom to decide for themselves on the basis
of relevant information about their future]{.underline}, and comparative
consideration of their past. [As [the deontological]{.mark} position
puts it]{.underline} so well, [to do so is to violate the
[imperative]{.mark} that [we must treat persons as]{.mark} rational and
as [ends in themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Extinction must precede ethics -- their prioritization of ideology turns value to life and makes extinction inevitable 

**Schell 82** Jonathan, writer for the New Yorker and nuclear weapons
expert, The Fate of the Earth

For the generations that now have to decide whether or not to risk the
future of the species, the implication of our species' unique place in
the order of things is that [[while things in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[life]{.underline}]{.mark} of mankind [[have worth, we must never raise
that worth above]{.underline}]{.mark} the life of mankind and above
[[our respect for]{.underline}]{.mark} that [life's [existence.]{.mark}
To do this would be to make of our highest ideals so many swords with
which to destroy ourselves. [To sum up the worth of our species by
reference to some particular]{.mark}]{.underline} standard, goal, or
[[ideology]{.mark}, no matter how]{.underline} elevated or
[noble]{.underline} it might be, [[would be to prepare the way for
extinction by closing]{.mark} down in thought and feeling [the
open-ended possibilities for human development]{.mark} which extinction
would close down in fact.]{.underline} There is only one circumstance in
which it might be possible to sum up the life and achievement of the
species, and that circumstance would be that it had already died, but
then, of course, there would be no one left to do the summing up. [Only
a generation that believed itself to be in possession of final, absolute
truth could ever conclude that it had reason to put an end to human
life, and only generations that recognized the limits to their own
wisdom and virtue would be likely to subordinate their interests and
dreams to the as yet unformed interests and undreamed dreams of the
future generations, and let human life go on.]{.underline}

### !/T -- NATO Peace

#### Studies confirm NATO's net violence-reducing -- because of its liberalism

Relations at the University of Cambridge; and Michael Doyle, Professor

Morlino, Sage, 2011, pp.1434-1439 /GoGreen!

Relying on new insights from game theory, [scholars]{.underline} during
the 1980s and 1990s [emphasized that]{.underline} so-called
[international regimes, consisting of agreed-on international norms,
rules, and decision-making procedures, can help states effectively
coordinate their policies and collaborate in the production of
international public goods]{.underline}, such as free trade, arms
control, and environmental protection. [Especially, if embedded in
formal multilateral institutions]{.underline}, such as the World Trade
Organization (WTO) or North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
regimes crucially improve the availability of information among states
in a given issue area, thereby promoting reciprocity and enhancing the
reputational costs of noncompliance. As noted by Robert Keohane,
institutionalized multilateralism also reduces strategic competition
over relative gains and thus further advances international cooperation.
Most international regime theorists accepted Kenneth Waltz\'s (1979)
neorealist assurription of states as black boxes-that is, unitary and
rational actors with given interests. Little or no attention was paid to
the impact on international cooperation of domestic political processes
and dynamics. Likewise, regime scholarship largely disregarded the
arguably crucial question of whether prolonged interaction in an
institutionalized international setting can fundamentally change
states\' interests or preferences over outcomes (as opposed to
preferences over strategies), thus engendering positive feedback loops
of increased overall cooperation. For these reasons, international
regime theory is not, properly speaking, liberal, and the term
neoliberal institutionalism frequently used to identify it is somewhat
misleading. It is only over the past decade or so that [liberal
international relations theorists have begun to [systematic]{.mark}ally
[study]{.mark} the relationship between domestic politics and
institutionalized international cooperation or global
governance]{.underline}. This new scholarship seeks to [[explain]{.mark}
in particular the [close]{.mark} international [cooperation among
liberal democracies as well as]{.mark} higher-than-average levels of
delegation by democracies to complex [multilateral bodies, such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**), NAFTA, and the WTO (see,
e.g., John Ikenberry, 2001; Helen Milner & Andrew Moravcsik, 2009). The
reasons that make liberal democracies particularly enthusiastic about
international cooperation are manifold: First, [transnational actors
such as nongovernmental organizations and private corporations thrive in
liberal democracies, and they frequently advocate increased
international cooperation]{.underline}; second, [elected democratic
officials rely on delegation to multilateral bodies]{.underline} such as
the WTO or the EU [to commit to a stable policy line and to
internationally lock in fragile domestic policies and constitutional
arrangements]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} finally, [powerful liberal
democracies, such as [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark},
voluntarily [bind themselves into]{.mark} complex [global
governance]{.mark} arrangements [to demonstrate strategic restraint and
create incentives for other states to cooperate]{.mark}, thereby
reducing the costs for maintaining international order]{.underline}.
[**[Recent scholarship]{.mark}**, such as that of Charles Boehmer and
colleagues, [has]{.mark} also **[confirmed]{.mark}** the classical
liberal intuition [that]{.mark}]{.underline} formal international
institutions, such as the United Nations (UN) or [[**NATO**,
**independently contribute to peace**]{.mark}, especially when they are
endowed with sophisticated administrative structures and
information-gathering capacities]{.underline}. In short, research on
global governance and especially on the relationship between democracy
and international cooperation is thriving, [and]{.underline} it usefully
[complements liberal scholarship on the democratic peace]{.underline}.

invoked to support Muslim bans, border walls, and mass deportations;
[conspiracy-mongering attacks on career civil servants]{.underline} as
agents of "the deep state," [and]{.underline} on
[journalists]{.underline} as "enem\[ies\] of the American people"; [and
orchestrated campaigns of lying and disinformation]{.underline} under
the banner of speaking "truth" directly to the people and opposing "fake
news." In many ways, [these tactics and actions are **all too
reminiscent** of]{.underline} the "origins of
**[totalitarianism]{.underline}**" discussed by Hannah Arendt in her
1951 classic of that title. To note this is not to deny the profound
differences between the global crises of 1914--1945 and today. But it is
to register profound fear for the future of liberal democracy.

[Colleagues]{.underline} further to my left [have been
**critical**]{.underline}, sometimes harshly, [of this liberal response.
They insist that Trump is **not quite so dangerous**, and that the
dangers he does pose are largely expressions of **deeper tendencies of
neoliberalism** that require **more fundamental challenge**. It thus
makes little sense, they [argue]{.mark}, for the left to reflexively
defend liberal democracy--- [**liberal democracy itself** is the
problem, and]{.mark} the [solution is]{.mark} its
**[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While tactically these
arguments track the 2016 debates between supporters of Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders, they also run deeper. Some on the left---whether
enthusiastic Bernie supporters, or unenthusiastic supporters who
nonetheless saw his candidacy as an opening---reviled Clinton for her
neoliberalism, and could not bring themselves to vote for her even once
she won the Democratic nomination. They argued that the threat posed by
Trump was overstated since both parties are oligarchical and capitalist
(they are), and thus essentially similar (they are not). [This
contingent believed that the real danger is **not Trumpism** but the
corruption, hypocrisy, inequality, and violence **plaguing liberal
democracy itself**]{.underline}.

To be clear, the majority of Sanders supporters did vote for Clinton in
the general election. Moreover, I have no interest in "blaming" people
with such convictions for Clinton's defeat, however they voted (and in a
liberal democracy each individual has the fundamental right to vote as
he or she chooses). Further, many Sanders activists have been involved
in important long-term organizing efforts that are in no way reducible
to the terms of a single election. At the same time, in the debates
about the election and since Trump's inauguration, there have been
serious differences of opinion between those who are greatly alarmed by
Trumpism and who regard the defense of liberal democracy as an urgent
imperative, and those who regard it as nothing more than a symptom of a
deeper and more fundamental crisis. "Socialism or barbarism" is a slogan
rarely heard. But something like it seems to represent the logic of an
anti-liberal position with real traction on the left.

It is important to acknowledge that [what we call "liberal democracy" is
a **complex**, **novel**, **imperfect**, and **ultimately fragile form
of politics**]{.underline}, created after the Second World War [through
an accommodation between liberalism and democracy that was **neither
inevitable nor innocent**]{.underline}. It required the buyin of social
democratic and Christian democratic movements and parties; it relied on
the unique conditions of postwar growth, class compromise, and Cold War
"vital center" anticommunism; and [it **incorporated from the start**
some profoundly illiberal policy commitments]{.underline} ([the
**national security state**, **post-colonial counter-insurgency**, an
**uncritical embrace** of "modernization," and **compromises with
racial** and **gender inequality**, to name a few]{.underline}). [This
regime was **flawed from the start**]{.underline}: it was already in
crisis by 1965, and much of the politics of the past sixty years can be
seen as an intensification of this crisis. Such an arrangement hardly
represents a "riddle of history solved."

[Yet liberal democracy---**[in spite of its corruptions]{.mark}**,
[**failings**, and]{.mark} **complicity with
[injustice]{.mark}**---[represents the **most practical** and
**normatively legitimate way of organizing political power**]{.mark} at
the **level of the nation-state**. And **[every effort to]{.mark}
install [an alternative has resulted in disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Liberal democracy is both **limited** and **precarious**]{.underline}.
And simple appeals to liberal values are insufficient, either to defend
liberal democracy under siege, or to further advance the causes of
social justice and deepen democracy. For this reason, I disagree with
self-identified liberal democrats who regard populism in any form as a
danger to liberal democracy. I would instead agree with those such as
Chantal Mouffe and Étienne Balibar, who argue that [new forms of left
populism and **new left movements** and **parties**]{.underline}
(exemplified by Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, and Demos in
Romania) [are **important** to advance the cause of **social justice**,
to **counter the rise** of right-wing populism, and thus to **defend
liberal democracy itself**.]{.underline}

At the same time, I believe that calls to unambiguously embrace a new
left populism, or to declare one's goal to be socialism (or for some,
even communism) are seriously misguided, at least for those who take
liberal values seriously. There are two reasons why.

The first is broadly political: because [a new]{.underline} socialist or
[left populist hegemony faces **profound** and probably **insuperable
obstacles**, and these are **not gainsaid** by the **obvious failings of
capitalism**]{.underline}. Marx was simply wrong when he declared that
"Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to
solve." And [the fact that capitalism is the **source of profound harm**
to social justice and environmental sustainability **does not mean**
that there is **any obvious way** to "**solve**," rather than **simply
to remedy**, these harms.]{.underline}

In their recent Jacobin piece "Social Democracy Is Good. But Not Good
Enough." Joseph Schwartz and Bhaskar Sunkara take issue with recent
advocacy of liberal versions of socialism. They argue that "history
shows us that achieving a stable welfare state while leaving capital's
power over the economy largely intact is itself far from viable. Even if
we wanted to stop at socialism within capitalism, it's not clear that we
could." But [it is **much less clear** that it is possible to
**institute a [wholesale]{.mark}**]{.underline} socialist
**[[transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, as Schwartz and Sunkara
themselves concede: "[To chart a different course, we would need a
**militant**]{.underline} labor **[movement]{.underline}** and a mass
socialist presence [strengthened by **accumulated
victories**]{.underline}, looking to not merely tame but overcome
capitalism." But [such a]{.underline} socialist [mass politics is
**[rather unlikely]{.mark}** given the current forms of social and
economic life]{.underline}, which differ dramatically from the forms of
industrialism that gave birth to the modern socialist movement in the
mid-nineteenth century.

"Post-Fordist" forms of flexible accumulation, [automation, neoliberal
forms of consumerism, new digital means of communication]{.underline},
new forms of "liquid modernity"---such developments [have promoted new
forms of inequality, but they have also **eroded** the social, cultural,
and economic bases of working-class formation]{.underline} that grounded
socialist politics in the past. In countries such as the United States,
[there is **no mass proletariat** to mobilize or organize]{.underline}.
And while there is a working class, not many of the individuals
inhabiting this class regard wage-labor as the defining feature of their
experience or identity under capitalism.

In fact, [a range of struggles for recognition now flourish in real
tension with class politics]{.underline}---including civil rights,
women's rights, and gay rights. [[Right-wing populism represents a
**powerful backlash** against these struggles]{.mark} that has
**successfully garnered substantial white working-class support**. The
identities of many members of the white working class are **deeply** and
**profoundly constituted** by sexism and resentment toward immigrants
and people of color in ways that make them **poor targets**]{.underline}
for socialist advocacy.

[It **does not follow** from this that]{.underline} socialist [political
organizing **ought to be disparaged**. But it does follow that left
[liberals have **every reason** to approach the aspiration to
**transcend**]{.mark}]{.underline} capitalism, and [**[liberal
democracy]{.underline}**, [with **skepticism**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.
[And]{.mark} so]{.underline}, when socialist [colleagues challenge us
from the left, insisting that we "**reify**" liberal democracy and fail
to understand the "**real**" sources of our difficulties, we have every
reason to [question **who exactly is doing the
reifying**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The second reason to keep a liberal distance from invocations of
socialist transformation relates to questions of ethical and political
judgment. [[Even if]{.mark} one were to [believe]{.mark} that [the
**only way**]{.mark} to defend liberal democracy and to defeat the
forces of the right [is]{.mark} to **join the struggle** for [a **more
radical challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline} to capitalism itself, [[this
**would not mitigate**]{.mark} **some very [difficult]{.mark}** and
**consequential [political choices]{.mark}** that present themselves in
the here and now]{.underline}.

Thus after Hillary Clinton was nominated, many Sanders supporters who
sincerely believed that something more radical than Clintonism was
necessary were faced with a stark choice: on the one hand, voting for
and supporting Clinton, and, on the other hand, refusing to support
Clinton, by abstaining or supporting Jill Stein, and thus making it more
likely that Donald Trump would be elected. To support Clinton in this
context was not to repudiate Sanders or the importance of the political
"revolution" he led. It was simply to acknowledge that the danger to
liberal democracy represented by Trump was too great---and that
neoliberalism with a human face is always to be preferred to right-wing
authoritarianism. A similar dilemma presented itself to many French
leftists in the May 2017 presidential elections. During the first round,
a number of center and left candidates decided to run, including left
socialist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, along with Marine Le Pen of the right-wing
National Front. But in the runoff, the choice was stark: support
Emmanuel Macron against Le Pen, on the grounds that the danger from the
right must be averted, or refuse to do so, on the grounds that Macron is
a neoliberal. Yanis Varoufakis, self-described "erratic Marxist" and
former Greek Finance Minister, explained the stakes in Project
Syndicate: Progressives have good reason to be angry with a liberal
establishment that feels comfortable with Macron. . . . Moreover, it is
not hard to identify with the French left's feeling that the liberal
establishment is getting its comeuppance with Le Pen's rise. . . . But
the decision of many leftists to maintain an equal distance between
Macron and Le Pen is inexcusable. There are two reasons for this. First,
the imperative to oppose racism trumps opposition to neoliberal
policies. . . . Just like in the 1940s, we have a duty to ensure that
the state's monopoly over the legitimate use of violence is not
controlled by those who harbor violent sentiments toward the foreigner,
the cultural or sexual minority member, the "other." . . . But there is
a second reason for backing Macron. . . . My disagreements with Macron
are legion. . . . \[yet\] I support Macron . . . \[for I\] refuse to be
part of a generation of leftists responsible for allowing a fascist and
racist to win the French presidency. Naturally, if Macron wins and
becomes merely another functionary of Europe's deep establishment, my
comrades and I will oppose him no less energetically than we are---or
should be---opposing Le Pen now.

Yet [there are those on the left who view the neoliberal as **no less of
a threat** than the neo-fascist]{.underline}. The philosopher Slavoj
**[Žižek]{.underline}**, for example, [**refused to support Macron
against Le Pen**, echoing a stance he had taken in the **Clinton-Trump
contest**]{.underline}. Similar sentiments have been expressed by the
scholar Nancy Fraser, a harsh critic of Clinton. Like Žižek, [**Fraser**
insists]{.underline} that "far from being the antidote to fascism,
(neo)liberalism is its partner in crime. . . . [the left should **refuse
the [choice]{.mark}** [between **progressive neolib**]{.mark}eralism
[and **reactionary populism**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[But there are times when **such a choice [is necessary]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} making the right choice is [**not a form of capitulation**
but **political responsibility**]{.mark}. The making of such a choice
**[does not preclude other choices as well]{.mark}**, and it [**makes
perfect sense** to say "I **support this**]{.mark}]{.underline}
candidate or [[**policy now**, when the alternative is **much
worse**]{.mark}, **[at the same time]{.mark}** that I [will **continue
to work** for a future in which **better choices are
available**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

And so on May 15, 2017, shortly after Macron's victory, Varoufakis, as
promised, published a follow-up: "Congratulations, President
Macron---Now We Oppose You." [There **may be a vantage point** from
which it makes sense to]{.underline} denounce Varoufakis for refusing to
[**refuse the choice** between "progressive neoliberalism and
reactionary populism." But it is a vantage point from which the **fate
of liberal democracy**, with its **civil liberties**, **ethnic** and
**religious tolerance**, and **political pluralism**---and the fate of
those constituencies who **need these very things to survive**---would
seem to **matter all too little**]{.underline}. As Varoufakis stated in
another op-ed for Le Monde, "Of course we all wish, at least those of us
on the left, that the French electoral system were not binary. But it
is. And given that it is, I refuse to be part of a generation of
European progressives who could have stopped Marine Le Pen from winning
France's Presidency but didn't." [Varoufakis describes the refusal of
this choice as "**scandalous**." To choose against right-wing
authoritarianism is to **put liberal democracy first**, and to treat it
**not as the end**, but as an **essential means of any ends worth
pursuing**]{.underline}.

The questions of means and ends raised by such electoral choices are
even more pressing when it comes to another set of tactics supported by
some on the left---tactics of sometimes violent direct action
represented by antifa. Natasha Lennard explained in the Nation last
August that "the antifascist project is not one of asking for better
statutes or a reconfiguration of rights. . . . antifa is a promise to
neo-Nazis and their bedfellows that we will confront them in the
streets; we will expose them online and inform their place of employ."
She makes clear that such a politics has little regard for the discourse
of human rights or the rule of law. Last summer, Lennard also pursued
this anti-liberal theme in Dissent: Time and again in recent months I
have seen political writers apoplectic over alleged rips in the social
contract, as wrought by Trump, anti-immigrant policy, or austerity, or
any number of political plagues. The liberal response has been outrage
and disbelief that the state can fall so far from its alleged foundation
as a contract forged by the will of equal pledgers. . . . Calling upon
some mythic social contract to deliver us from evil is not just futile,
it's downright religious, as Nietzsche would see it. Liberal outrage
peddles Christian morality in a world where God is dead, and we have
killed him. . . . Power determines which narratives about reality get to
count as truth. Recognizing this is a political necessity for those who
would challenge the Trumpian Weltanschauung." Antifa historian and
organizer Mark Bray similarly writes that "anti-fascism is an illiberal
politics of social revolutionism applied to fighting the Far Right, not
only literal fascists \[emphasis added\]." The roots of antifa lie in
the most radical forms of anarchism. As the journalist Chris Hedges (and
also Noam Chomsky) have argued, "The focus on street violence diverts
activists from the far less glamorous building of relationships and
alternative institutions and community organizing that alone will make
effective resistance possible." Moreover, antifa rhetoric, like the "alt
right" and neo-Nazi rhetoric it despises, is Manichean. Instead of
efforts to forge broad coalitions capable of defeating right-wing
authoritarians at the ballot box, antifa tactics promote cycles of
recrimination, giving public credibility to right-wing authoritarians,
such as Trump, who valorize police brutality and claim to represent "law
and order." There is a long history of Manichean "friend/enemy" thinking
on the left, represented by polemics such as Lenin's 1918 "The
Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky" and Trotsky's 1938
Their Morals and Ours. It was, in part, to counter such thinking that
Dissent magazine was founded. That generation of democratic socialists,
shaken by the experiences of Stalinism, totalitarianism, genocide, and
world war, and hemmed in by McCarthyism and what Irving Howe called a
deadening "age of conformity," created a journal committed to a critical
and liberal version of socialism centering on the importance of vigorous
disagreement. In its sixty-four years, Dissent has experienced
generational changes and featured many important debates. But at no time
since the journal's founding has the very existence of liberal democracy
seemed more in danger.

[The **[illiberal forces]{.mark}** on the rise [threaten to **reverse
every important achievement**, **however limited**, of the **past five
decades**]{.mark} of liberal democracy. These achievements include
**reproductive freedom** and **domestic violence legislation**;
**environmental** and **workplace health** and **safety regulation**;
**civil rights** and **voting rights enforcement**; moderate forms of
**consumer protection**; and **press freedom** and **protection against
censorship**. All **deserve to be defended**, **not** because of their
role in advancing us toward a **future beyond capitalism**, but because
they **represent real improvements** in our lives. The
**fear-mongering**, **repression**, and **evisceration of public
criticism** promoted by right-wing populism **diminish democratic
citizenship for everyone**. They are **harmful to left organizing** and
to anyone who believes in defending political freedom. Resisting these
assaults on liberal democracy through the **political means made
available by liberal democracy** is an **urgent task**. This **does not
prevent one from also seeking to build a movement** beyond "resistance."
But resistance is **important work in its own right** and, for
many]{.underline} of us, [it is the work that is **currently most
important**]{.underline}.

Sarah Leonard, a Dissent editor-at-large and former editor at the
Nation, recently remarked about the uncertainties of liberals: The
problem with many prominent representatives of liberalism today . . . is
that they don't seem to know which side they're on. Say Bernie, vote
Hillary; say universal health care, but condemn its advocacy; say
electable, lose everywhere; say you'll don sneakers to walk the picket
line, don't show up. The name of my desire is socialism; do liberals
know the name of theirs? This reluctance to pick "a side" that disturbs
Leonard---which I prefer to describe as ambivalence---is real, and while
it can be bridged, I doubt it can be eliminated. For to be a left
liberal is to be troubled by the hesitations and inconsistencies of
which Leonard writes but also to believe that a pluralistic politics of
freedom in our complex world requires such tribulations. I supported
Sanders and voted for him in the Indiana primary. But I doubted he could
win the Democratic nomination, much less the general election, and I
worried about the harshness with which some of his supporters attacked
Clinton, a harshness that has persisted over the past year. I support
universal healthcare, and welcome the shift by many important Democratic
leaders to support the Sanders plan. Still, I wonder whether the plan
itself is viable, and whether it is the most compelling issue on which
to mobilize the Democratic Party to electoral victories in 2018 and
2020. Because I so profoundly fear Trumpism, I regard Democratic
victories as critical---even if they involve compromises on healthcare
and even as they will likely bring disappointments. Am I confused? Am I
lacking in conviction? Or am I simply unable to believe there are easy,
clear-cut answers to many current political questions?

And so ["liberal" works]{.underline} for me [as a **political
identity**]{.underline} in a way that "socialist" does not. [It **places
a priority** on the civil and political freedoms that **make it possible
for us to argue** about how to challenge injustice and work for greater
justice. It furnishes **peaceful channels of political participation**
and **contestation** that allow for **provisional agreements to be
reached** about how to move forward]{.underline}.

Again, Lennard writes, disparagingly, that: "The liberal response has
been outrage and disbelief that the state can fall so far from its
alleged foundation as a contract forged by the will of equal pledgers."
But [liberals]{.underline} such as myself [**do not believe** that the
liberal democratic state was **ever founded** through an **idyllic
process** of egalitarian consent. We believe **only** that liberal
democracy is a **flawed outcome of struggle worth defending**, and that
the idea of free and equal democratic will formation has **furnished**,
and **continues to furnish**, a **powerful normative ideal**. There is
no "mythic social contract" that can "deliver us from
evil."]{.underline} There is no such contract, and there is no such
deliverance. [There is **only ongoing debate** and
**contestation**.]{.underline}

It is perhaps [that **fundamental commitment** to **ongoing political
contestation**]{.underline} that marks the difference between left
liberals and those to our left who embrace a more "radical" and often
emphatically socialist politics. To note this is not to disparage those
to my left. It [is to identify **points of honest difference** as well
as **commonalities**, on which **agreements** and **alliances are
possible**]{.underline}.

In December 2001, Robert Kuttner published a short piece in the liberal
journal he co-edits, the American Prospect, with the self-explanatory
title "Why Liberals Need Radicals." In June 2013, Bhaskar Sunkara,
editor of Jacobin, published a piece in the Nation, entitled "Letter to
'The Nation' From a Young Radical." Sunkara explains why he and his
colleagues have embraced a new radicalism with strong Marxist roots. He
too makes the case that [liberals and radicals **need each
other**]{.underline}. At the same time, from the radical and not the
liberal side, Sunkara's view of this association is rather harsh:
"American radicalism has had a complex and at times contradictory
association with liberalism. At the peak of the socialist movement,
[leftists **fed off liberal victories**. Radicals]{.underline}, in turn,
[have **added coherence** and **punch** to **every key liberal
struggle** and **advance** of the past century. Such a **mutually
beneficial alliance** could be in the works again.]{.underline} The
first step is to smash the existing liberal coalition and rebuild it on
a radically different basis."

I share Sunkara's belief that now is the time for mutually beneficial
connections and alliances between democratic socialists and liberals.
But [I am]{.underline} rather **[wary]{.underline}**---perhaps for
reasons of generational experience---[of calls to "**smash the existing
liberal coalition**."]{.underline} I am skeptical of that "radically
different basis." Most importantly, I believe that [[the **danger posed
by the radical right**, to]{.mark} the **political conditions** and
**elemental life chances of [many millions]{.mark} of individuals**,
[makes it important to **defend**]{.mark}, to **build**, [and]{.mark} to
[**extend the liberal coalition** rather than **disrupt** or **destroy
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because in the struggle between socialism and
barbarism, it is barbarism that has the advantage. And because [the
**civil** and **political freedoms** and forms of **responsive public
policy** made possible by liberal democracy are a **necessary condition
of any social** or **economic justice worth having**]{.underline}.

#### Ks of lib-ism link to themselves by dismissing post-colonial liberal perspectives and the [concrete needs]{.underline} of colonial subjects---rejecting lib-ism [all too easily]{.underline} feeds into the [growing wave]{.underline} of global fascism

**Claudio, 19**---Associate Professor at De La Salle University
Manila\'s College of Liberal Arts (Lisandro, "Conclusion: Resurrecting
Plants," *Jose Rizal: Liberalism and the Paradox of Coloniality*, 71-77,
SpringerLink, dml)

[Too often, with liberalism, we **throw the baby out with the
bathwater**]{.underline}. In contemporary critical and cultural theory,
criticisms of liberalism are almost mandatory. This is most true in the
field of postcolonial theory or in philosophies of the Global South.
[For many postcolonial scholars, "western" liberalism is the **common
enemy** of the politics and ideas from the margins of global knowledge
production]{.underline}. At times, one may be led to think that, without
liberalism as a common target, postcolonial theory would lose its
cohesion. Postcolonies are, after all, different, and the philosophies
their intellectuals have espoused have likewise been varied. Without a
positive notion of theory from the Global South, scholars have turned to
denigrating "liberal" modernity.1

Of course, [some anti-liberal scholarship has **surfaced dark legacies**
of the European tradition. But even these **turn critique into blanket
dismissal**]{.underline}. For example, the scathing work of Uday Singh
Mehta (1999) proves how British liberal intellectuals like Jeremy
Benthan, James and John Stuart Mill, and Lord Macaulay defended
imperialism, particularly in India. The idea of Western tutelage for
"backward" societies, he contends, stems from the liberal embrace of
universal values to the exclusion of different cultures and belief
systems. Hence, "the liberal involvement with the British Empire is
broadly coeval with liberalism itself" (ibid., 4). Echoing Mehta, the
sociologist Julian Go (2017, 74) contends that "civic-liberal nations"
are "empire-states" (emphasis in original) because they "are predicated
upon a core hierarchized binary of citizen and Other---that is, between
those who are members of the community because they are rational,
mature, and civilized, and those who are not."

[These scholars are **sympathetic to the concerns** of postcolonies and
the Global South. But they have **unwittingly wedded themselves** to the
study of the **Global North**. In studying liberalism, they **privilege
the voices of liberals from Europe**, while **neglecting** how
liberalism has been **articulated in postcolonies themselves**. A global
history of liberalism **must acknowledge the contributions of colonial
thinkers** in its development]{.underline}. True enough, we may condemn
thinkers like Mill for their defense of imperialism, but we must also
celebrate their counterpoints from within the liberal tradition. We must
celebrate thinkers like Rizal.

Rizal would have accepted many of the objections of scholars like Mehta
and Go. He too knew how [liberals]{.underline} from colonial metropoles
[**could use their ideas to support colonialism**. But]{.underline}
Rizal would have **[reject]{.underline}**ed [the **reduction of
liberalism's vast history** to the **actions of
colonizers**]{.underline}. In this book, I hope to have shown that,
while Rizal criticized Spanish liberals, he never abandoned the liberal
project. Rather, he believed that [liberalism could be **renewed**, even
**purified**, in the colony]{.underline}, through the painful
experiences of colonials like himself.

Rizal too would not have dismissed liberalism simply because it could
create "Others." For he knew that [any political community **needs to
have an inside** and an **outside**: nations have foreigners, religions
have non-believers, and socialist movements have class
enemies]{.underline}. In this regard, [liberalism is **no different**
from other political ideals that form bonds of community]{.underline}.
Rizal knew, however, that the bonds of community within liberal
republics could be expansive and cosmopolitan. He saw how the category
"Filipino" could expand from only referring to creoles to include all
those who identified with the emergent nation. He believed in
communities not bound by race or religion, but adherence to
Enlightenment philosophy.

[Such a worldview]{.underline} is simple, but it [comes to us with a
**certain urgency** today, at a time when "**illiberal democracy**" is
on]{.underline}e [the rise]{.underline}. For much of the post-Cold War
world, [progressive and radical thinkers insisted]{.underline} that
there was more to human political development than the mere liberal "end
of history." [There **had to be more radical ways** to imagining
politics. Amid this desire, much anti-liberal thinking became
**nihilistic**, and those who condemned liberalism **rarely thought of
concrete alternatives**]{.underline}. At worse, [they denigrated the
basic tenets of liberalism, **without care for the possible
repercussions**]{.underline}.

The disillusionment with liberalism is, of course, nothing new. Even as
Rizal was articulating a liberalism for the colonized in the nineteenth
century, many Europeans were already becoming sick of the liberal
project. Francois Furet (2000, 11) explains that many radicals from that
period had come to believe "that modern liberal democracy was
threatening society with dissolution because it atomized individuals,
made them indifferent to public interest, weakened authority, and
encouraged class hatred." This disillusionment would eventually lead to
the twin illiberal philosophies that dominated the twentieth century:
fascism on the right and Communism on the Left.

History, of course, does not repeat itself. But [there are **echoes of
the illiberal early twentieth century today**]{.underline}. If [the
present moment prompts comparisons with the 1930s and
1940s]{.underline}, it is not because we are about to enter another
period of global warfare. Rather, it is [because]{.underline}, [our
present]{.underline}, like those years, **[teems with
illiberalism]{.underline}**. And, [like the early twentieth century,
intellectuals]{.underline} in the West [have been **averse to defending
liberal values**, preferring instead **utopian visions of politics**
that can **neither be tested nor implemented**]{.underline}. For much of
the twentieth century, as Hollander (2016) explains, [the illiberalism
of intellectuals was evident in the **hero worship of dictators** in
places like Germany, China, Cuba, the Soviet Union, Cambodia, and
Venezuela. Western intellectuals looked to strongmen on both the left
and the right as **figures of inspiration** because of a "**painful
awareness** of the inability of Western, pluralistic, capitalist
societies to deliver sustaining values and beliefs that would enable
them to confront and weather the endemic crises and frustrations of
life]{.underline}, and especially modern life" (ibid., 294).

[These same frustrations not only led]{.underline} Western
[intellectuals to **admire dictators**; they also brought them to
**nihilistic positions against**]{.underline} Enlightenment traditions
like [**liberalism**. The **identification with authoritarian figures**
and the **rejection of "Western liberalism"** are impulses
of]{.underline} what Pascal Bruckner (2010, 21) calls [a masochistic
"penitential class," who, because of their **guilt about colonialism**,
**turn their back** on the values of the Enlightenment. Today, radical
scholars from the Global North seek to theorize the Global South **in
opposition to a static**, **liberal North/West**. Some are **so
cavalier** that they dismiss even the **most humane of Enlightenment
traditions** such as **human rights**]{.underline}. For example, Jean
and John Comaroff (2001, 39--40), purveyors of "theory from the south,"
diminish the value of human rights by comparing rights-based thinking to
contemporary capitalism, contending that "If law underpins the langue of
neoliberalism, constitutionalism has become the parole of universal
human rights, a global argot that individuates the citizen and, by
making cultural identity a private asset, rather than a collective
claim, transmutes difference into likeness."

[Such]{.underline} purple [prose is **merely academese** for the **tired
argument** that individualistic human rights are **incompatible with
collectivist societies**]{.underline}. In fact, [the same argument was
**better phrased** by]{.underline} the spokesperson of the authoritarian
Philippine president Rodrigo **[Duterte]{.underline}**, when he was
justifying the murder of thousands of drug suspects. "The liberal
Western values being imposed upon an Asian nation that places premium on
common good," he argued, "is both insensitive and displays a lack of
appreciation for the diversity of global culture" (Quoted in Esmaquel
2017). [Western intellectuals **do not always directly endorse
demagogues**, but they are **tempted by cool detachment to speak like
them**]{.underline}.

Hollander (2016, 9) contends that many pro-dictatorship intellectuals
endorsed authoritarianism from a distance, and many of them "had little
to gain, or lose" in their judgments. Until today, [many illiberal
commentators on the Global South from the Global North do so from **far
away**, **secure** that constitutional rights **do not collapse
overnight**]{.underline} in places like the United States or
Europe---Donald Trump and the European far-right notwithstanding.
[Unfortunately, for those of us in places like the Philippines, a human
rights regime **may disintegrate overnight**]{.underline}, as in the
case of Duterte's Philippines. Rizal's country was once a broken, if
relatively stable, liberal democracy. After the collapse of Ferdinand
Marcos's dictatorship in 1986, it slowly inched its way toward some
semblance of a liberal democracy, where regular elections occurred,
civil society movements focused on institution building, and relatively
open elections occurred (Quimpo 2008; Curato 2015; Thompson 1996). In
2016, the country was taken over by a murderous demagogue.

This collapse of liberal democracy occurs amid thunderous applause, with
Duterte remaining popular despite a drug war that has killed thousands.
Because Duterte has devalued his country's human rights tradition---"If
it concern human rights, I don't give a shit"---he once claimed (Quoted
in Holmes 2016)---he has also devalued life. Survey data shows that the
majority of Filipinos believe that extra-judicial killings are occurring
under the drug war, yet a significant majority remain supportive of the
government's draconian campaign (Pulse Asia Research Inc. 2017). Such is
the moral crisis that Duterte has created.

When Rizal argued that pain purified liberalism, he was expressing a
profound but obvious insight: Those who have had liberty denied them
value it even more. Those who believe that liberty may slip away are
more cautious in their criticisms of basic freedoms. For a liberal in
the Philippines, the truth of this message can be found in the most
quotidian contexts. Many liberals in my country have had to fight for
liberal values in religious schools, patriarchal families, and other
conservative institutions. Under Duterte , they fight amid an electorate
that is increasingly proving susceptible to the temptations of
authoritarianism. It is an everyday struggle for everyday changes.

[Liberalism continues to be **pragmatic**. It is pragmatic for those who
see the **concrete needs of postcolonies**]{.underline}, for thinkers
like Rizal [who seek **evolving modernities**]{.underline} for their
nations. For Nigerian philosopher Olúfẹmi Táíwò (2014, 10), [seeking
these]{.underline} modernities [requires being **less concerned with the
provenance of ideas** and **more with their usefulness**]{.underline}.
He contends "that [the countries of Asia and Latin America that have
**transformed themselves for the better** are precisely the ones that
have **wised up to the idea** that---regardless of what they think of
modernity and the West]{.underline}, which has most benefited from its
proliferation---[a **good way to improve their lot** in the world is to
**borrow some pages from the West's playbook**]{.underline}."

[While liberalism is an **inadequate philosophy**---it constantly has to
grapple with its bourgeois origins---many of its principles are
**necessary checks** against the **excesses of political power**. The
**fault of liberalism's critics** has been to view it as an **ends in
itself** instead of a **system of guarantees**, a **bare minimum** of
treating citizens]{.underline} in a political community
[with]{.underline} what Orwell called "**[common
decency]{.underline}**." The history of liberalism has shown how [many
ideas can be **grafted onto the liberal project**. Social
democracy]{.underline}, for example, [represented liberalism coming to
terms with class inequality.]{.underline} And, indeed, as Tony Judt
(2010, 52) has argued, it was the welfare that bound citizens to the
state's liberal institutions.

[Liberalism **grows**. Liberal America **once had slaves**. Liberal
countries from across the world **refused women the right to vote**. And
many liberal states **once had colonies**, which they exploited. But
**because of anti-colonial liberals**]{.underline} like Rizal, [we now
**recognize colonialism** as a **contradiction of the liberal project**.
This recognition is a **gift of the Enlightenment**]{.underline}, and
someone like Rizal had no qualms about appropriating what he saw in
Europe, and grafting them into colonial contexts. He would have agreed
with Bruckner (2010, 28) who contends that "[There is **no doubt** that
Europe has **given birth to monsters**, but **at the same time** it has
given birth to theories that **make it possible to understand** and
**destroy these monsters**]{.underline}."

[The rise of global populism and authoritarianism means we **can no
longer dismiss liberal principles as lightly**, since anti-liberalism
**feeds into the rhetoric of present-day dictators**]{.underline}. The
Philippine liberal tradition runs deep, but it is always in a precarious
position, especially now. [For those of us who seek comfort amid the
tribulations of the present, we may return to]{.underline} Rizal's
enigmatic [vision of liberalism being a "**plant that never dies**." The
liberal tradition **may be in tatters**, but we only need to **replant
its seeds** and **await its resurrection**]{.underline}.

#### Abdicating a defense of lib-ism's self-correcting capacities leaves the vacuum open for authoritarianism while removing any checks on its rise

**Claudio, 17**---Associate Professor at De La Salle University
Manila\'s College of Liberal Arts (Lisandro, "Defending Liberalism in
the Global South: Notes from Duterte\'s Philippines," The Global South,
Volume 11, Number 2, Fall 2017, pp. 92-107, dml) \[gendered language
modifications denoted by brackets\]

In all the criticisms cited above, [critics **reduce liberalism to a
static idea**, holding it up to the **most stringent
criteria**]{.underline}, which are not equally applied to other existing
political models. (To muster such vitriol against Marxism would
certainly elicit accusations of fascistic anti-Communism). [But **any
nuanced history** of liberal thought must acknowledge the **steady
expansion** of liberalism's political and ethical horizons]{.underline}.
Edmund Fawcett, for example, has shown how [liberalism, which began as a
credo of the elites]{.underline} (liberty for a select few) [grew into
liberal democracy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and thus
became a **grammar for mass politics**]{.underline} (2014, 143). Thus,
[while]{.underline} we may concede that [liberal ideas have **previously
marginalized women**, the **poor**, and **various racial others**, we
must also note its **historical capacity for self-correction**.
Scholars]{.underline} like Mehta or Go [are **quick to point out
liberalism's sins** but **neglect how relatively quickly** some of these
sins were rectified]{.underline}.

Liberalism's expansiveness is present even in the US-based
civic-liberalism that scholars like Go deride. For, as Richard Rorty
reminds us, while the United States has had a history of subjugation and
hypocrisy, its greatest minds, such as Walt Whitman and John Dewey,
constantly infused their critiques with a vision of what a more
inclusive US society could be in the future (1997, 8). [The liberal
experiment, **always in the process of becoming**, was premised on
"**replacing shared knowledge** of what is already real with **social
hope** for what might become real"]{.underline} (18). [Liberalism is an
idea **centered on progress**, and progress **assumes that mistakes were
once made**. Otherwise, **what are we to progress from**?]{.underline}

[Much of anti-liberal postcolonial theorization is built on]{.underline}
straw men [\[**straw persons**\], based on **incomplete histories** of
both Northern and Southern liberalisms, and on assumptions about
political models that **have not** or **cannot be tested**]{.underline}.
More importantly, [these critiques **do not seriously consider their
implications** in the Global South, where problems like poverty and
violence are **immediate** and **pressing**, making **ameliorative
reform more urgent**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the **institutional
blueprint** of a liberal democracy is **necessary** to maintain a
**baseline of politics** that prevents the **excesses of
authoritarianism** and the **ethical relativism that enables
it**]{.underline}. As Dipesh Chakrabarty prosaically yet correctly
concedes, ["we do not in modernity and as yet, know of **desirable
institutional arrangements** in public life that could be **seriously
built** on principles **other than those of liberalism**"]{.underline}
(emphasis in original, 2001, 126). [When those desirable institutional
arrangements **collapse**, polities enter periods of **violent crisis**.
This is currently happening in the **Philippines**]{.underline}.

Duterte and the Attack on the Liberal State

[Anti-liberalism in aid of authoritarianism has a **long tradition** in
Asia. Pitting "Asian" communal values against Western individualism has
served to justify **various repressive measures**, from **racist
bumiputra laws** in Malaysia to **press censorship** in
Singapore]{.underline}. In India, the communalist rhetoric of the Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party) positions itself against
the "foreign" liberalism of intellectuals. For this final section, I
want to examine how [this same rhetoric has been reproduced in the
Philippines by]{.underline} the populist strongman Rodrigo [**Duterte**,
who has not only prosecuted a bloody war on drugs, but has also
**denigrated** and **weakened the liberal democratic institutions** of
his country]{.underline}.

As we saw earlier, [the anti-colonial liberalism of figures like Rizal
**birthed the Philippine nation**. The prominence of liberal
intellectuals continued throughout the American colonial period and the
postwar period of independence. Educators pushed for pedagogy that was
**informed by**]{.underline} John Dewey's **[liberal
internationalism]{.underline}** (Claudio 2015a), [diplomats were
**integral** to the formation of a global human rights architecture at
the United Nations]{.underline} (Claudio 2015b), [and economic debates
were **centered on the liberal management** of an export
industry]{.underline} (Claudio 2017, 45--71). [For many Filipinos, the
claim that their country represented the success of a US-style liberal
democracy in Asia was **more than postcolonial lip
service**.]{.underline}

The country's liberal experiment ground to a halt in 1972, when
President Ferdinand Marcos implemented martial law to perpetuate himself
in power. The dictator padlocked congress, arrested activists and
opposition leaders, and shut down what many considered the freest press
in Asia. Marcos's downfall in 1986 restored liberal democracy, but this
restored democracy was fragile. Thirty years after the fall of Marcos,
another budding dictator has emerged to challenge the country's liberal
tradition. As a candidate in 2016, Rodrigo Duterte ran on a wave of
popular disillusionment with the liberal reformism of his predecessor,
Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III (2010--2016)---son of former president
Corazon Aquino (1988-- 1992) and martyred anti-Marcos opposition senator
Benigno Aquino Jr. Though President Aquino and his Liberal Party were
consistently popular for the majority of his six-year term, a
congressional corruption scandal and a botched military operation dented
the president's reputation during his final years in office. Moreover,
quotidian problems such as worsening traffic in the already gridlocked
Metropolitan Manila area raised frustration with government.

[Duterte]{.underline} emerged seemingly out of nowhere, a little-known
mayor from the southern city of Davao. Commentators thought he would
fail to compete with the popularity and machinery of the three leading
mainstream candidates, which included the daughter of the country's most
famous action star, the incumbent vice president, and Aquino's interior
secretary. Duterte's rise was first a blip that became unstoppable, and
it caught Filipino pundits off guard. Yet his campaign [tapped into
multiple dormant impulses]{.underline} in the electorate:
[**authoritarian nostalgia**, a **disdain for**]{.underline}
Manila-based [**politicians**, and **impatience with
reformism**]{.underline}. His campaign tagline, "change is coming," as
Anne Applebaum correctly notes, had "the same empty appeal as 'make
American great again'" (2016). [Like]{.underline} the United States'
Donald [Trump]{.underline}, [it was this **emptiness**, couched in
**unbridled anger**, which turned Duterte into an **empty canvas** for
various forms of disaffection]{.underline}.7

From the fall of the Marcos in 1986 to Duterte's assumption of power,
the Philippines had been involved in a slow if uneven process of
redemocratization. Within this period, memories of the bloodless EDSA
"People Power" revolution that unseated Marcos became the organizing
mnemonic template of the post-Marcos state.8 Its heroes, particularly
Corazon Aquino (widow of a slain opposition senator and Marcos's
successor), became enshrined as the secular saints of the
post-authoritarian republic in a Manichean divide that separated the
forces of democracy and those of the dictatorship (Claudio 2013). During
this period, the country developed a robust, grassroots democratic
culture---largely a product of the various civil society organizations
that emerged from the ashes of the anti-Marcos opposition. Despite the
vibrancy of what political scientist Nathan Quimpo labeled the
Philippine "contested democracy,"---led by a free-flowing, non-Communist
Left---certain problems remained intractable (2008). In particular,
violent political dynasties and local machine politicians continued to
dominate regional politics. As Benedict Anderson explains, the end of
the Marcos regime may have ended authoritarianism, but it brought back
the system of oligarch-led "cacique democracy" (1998). Many voters and
commentators saw Duterte as a cure to the dominance of the oligarchs.
That Duterte himself came from a local oligarchic background became
irrelevant. His anti-elitism manifested in a rough-talking rhetorical
style that separated him from the cultivated candidates of the
"establishment." The violence began even before Duterte took office,
with drug-related vigilante killings spiking mere days after the
election. As president, Duterte has overseen the bloodiest display of
state power in Philippine history. Conservative estimates place the
death toll at 7,000 as of August 2017 (Kine 2017). Although there are no
accurate statistics for the death toll under Marcos (the mass killings
occurred in remote provinces), the velocity of killing under Duterte is
unprecedented. Beyond the violence, Duterte has also poisoned public
discourse and damaged political institutions. Apart from destroying the
reputation of Aquino's Liberal Party, he has also challenged the
country's liberal tradition by glorifying the late dictator Marcos,
whose remains the president buried in the country's hero's cemetery. As
with most populists, it is sometimes difficult to determine what Duterte
stands for. It is clear, however, what he is against. For Duterte, notes
Walden Bello, "the target is liberal-democracy---the dominant ideology
and political system of our time" (2017, np). Much like Trump and
Vladimir Putin, Duterte's propaganda machinery relies heavily on
networks of social media trolls who share fake news and promote
conspiracy theories. A primary target of trolling operations and
presidential pronouncements has been the beleaguered Commission on Human
Rights (CHR), an independent constitutional body that seeks to
investigate the state's alleged human rights violations. In late 2017,
the Duterte-controlled House of Representatives (the lower house) voted
to allocate a mere P1,000 Philippine pesos (20 USD) for its annual
budget, a stunt celebrated by Duterte's online supporters (Cupin 2017).
Though the defunding was soon corrected by a more circumspect Senate
(upper house), it sent a message that the liberal constitutional
framework of the Philippines was collapsing with thunderous applause.
Duterte and his allies represent institutions that promote human rights
as hindrances to the president's mission of national renewal. When the
United Nations special rapporteur on summary executions requested to
investigate the killings, Duterte's government rejected the offer. The
president's spokesperson justified the decision by claiming that the UN
was seeking to impose "liberal Western values" on "an Asian nation that
places premium on common good" The UN was, he concluded, "both
insensitive and display\[ed\] a lack of appreciation for the diversity
of global culture" (quoted in Esmaquel 2017, np). Always more pithy,
Duterte himself claimed that, "if it involves human rights, I don't give
a shit" (quoted in Holmes 2016, np).

Alas, Duterte's rhetoric has worked. Into his second year in office, the
President enjoys over 80% approval rating ("Pulse: Duterte\..." 2017),
largely from a population that does not care how many die as long as it
does not affect them. [The triumph of]{.underline} what commentators
have called "**[Dutertismo]{.underline}**" is complete, and it [proves
that there are, indeed, **alternatives to liberal politics**. Whether
these alternatives are **desirable** is a **different
matter**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[Global liberalism is in **crisis**. Duterte's rise in the Philippines
is just one example of the illiberal, populist backlash triggered by
multiple causes]{.underline}, including the inequalities of economic
globalization, the smugness of the liberal elite, and the appeal of
strongman rule.

[It would be]{.underline} extreme and certainly [false to claim that
anti-liberal postcolonial theory]{.underline} or theory from the South
[**caused** or even **contributed** to the rise of global populism.
Doing so would **confuse the symptom for the cause**. Yet we must also
**hold intellectuals to task** for **failing to rise to the defense** of
basic common principles **anchored on liberal ideals** of dignity,
tolerance, human rights, and, yes, a certain degree of
universalism]{.underline}. For the historian Tony Judt (1988), [what is
**necessary** is a **renewed moralism** in intellectual life---the
responsibility to **confront political excesses** and **intellectual
flights of fancy**. Such an approach would **temper**]{.underline} the
[**cynicism**, **cool detachment**, and **disdain for the
Enlightenment**]{.underline} that defines much writing on the Global
South.

The [anti-liberal theorizing]{.underline} on the Global South [by
scholars working in the Global North may be a **safe exhaust valve** for
their frustrations and boredom with the liberal democracy they
experience every day]{.underline}. Trump notwithstanding, [liberal
institutions are stronger in places like the United States and Europe
and can therefore be **taken for granted**]{.underline}, even maligned.
[But the same **cannot be said of the Global South**, where liberal
democratic institutions can **collapse almost overnight**, as they have
in Duterte's Philippines]{.underline}. To put things in blunt and
moralistic terms: [my president is **slaughtering my countrymen by the
thousands**, justifying the murders by **dismissing liberalism** and
human rights as "**Western**." I **do not have the luxury** of
"**problematizing**" human rights as **symptomatic** of the era of
"**neoliberalism**." Scholars **should be careful of the illiberalism
they wish for** in the Global North, because we in the Global South
**just might get it** in the form of a **bloodthirsty
autocrat**]{.underline}.

[A **restoration of liberal democratic principles**]{.underline} in my
country [is]{.underline} urgent---[a **matter of life** and **death**.
And it is with this sense of urgency that we must **rethink
liberalism**]{.underline} in the Global South, [**not as an endpoint**
of political development]{.underline} ("end of history"), [but as the
**bare minimum** of democratic politics]{.underline}. A
[liberalism]{.underline} for the Global South [must be **simultaneously
anchored on realism** and **hopefulness**. A moralist's liberal stance
must be anchored on]{.underline}, to corrupt what Gramsci said for
Marxist ends, [a **pessimism of the intellect** conjoined with an
**optimism of the will**. Except, since liberalism **refuses to
foreground a revolutionary break** along the horizon, it **leaves more
room for optimism**]{.underline}. As modus vivendi, [liberalism **has no
telos**; it is **never fully complete**. Hence it is **never fully a
success** or a **failure**]{.underline}.

[The Global South, like liberalism, is a **provisional** and **syncretic
project**, built on **imagined networks of solidarity** yet anchored on
the **necessity of everyday political praxis**. They are both **open**,
because they are both in **perennial translation**]{.underline}. As
Arjun Appadurai contends, [it is in liberalism that we find **seeds of
cosmopolitanism**, because it is premised on
"self-expansion"]{.underline} (2005, 434). [This self-expansion may lead
us into **new theoretical horizons**]{.underline} (even new forms of
socialism), [but it will remain anchored on basic principles: the
**respect for autonomy**, the **tolerance of other opinions**, and the
**primacy of human rights**]{.underline}. We uphold these values in both
the Global North and the Global South.

#### Their Ks of lib-ism [lack scholarly rigor]{.underline} and have it [backwards]{.underline}---lib-ism's failings come from it not being [vigorously defended enough]{.underline} and historical anti-colonial resistance [explicitly reflected liberal values]{.underline}---their K independently [dooms positive reform]{.underline} in the Global South

**Claudio, 17**---Associate Professor at De La Salle University
Manila\'s College of Liberal Arts (Lisandro, "Defending Liberalism in
the Global South: Notes from Duterte\'s Philippines," The Global South,
Volume 11, Number 2, Fall 2017, pp. 92-107, dml)

First is [the claim that liberalism is a **universalizing Enlightenment
idea** that has **imposed itself** on colonial societies]{.underline}.
In displacing other forms of non-Western thinking, [critics
say]{.underline} it creates a hierarchy between a civilized/liberal
subject and an uncivilized/illiberal one, thus allowing for the violence
of colonialism. The most prominent writer in this vein is Uday Singh
Mehta (1999), who argues that [imperialism was **not a contradiction**
within liberal thought but **inherent** in it]{.underline}.2 Through
colonialism, he contends, liberalism "found a project, with all the
grandeur of scale, implicit permanence, purposefulness, and the absence
of a need to negotiate with what is extant" (12). Mehta based his
account largely on a critique of British liberalism and its effects on
colonial India. But others have applied his arguments to other liberal
empires. By examining the United States' colonial expansion in the late
nineteenth century, Julian Go challenges the narrative of an inclusive
liberal nationalism in the US. He contends that one must think of
"civic-liberal nations as liberal empire-states" (emphasis in original,
2017, 74). Drawing from the influential anti-liberalism of Losurdo
(2014), Go claims that both "are predicated upon a core hierarchized
binary of citizen and Other---that is, between those who are members of
the community because they are rational, mature, and civilized, and
those who are not" (74). [It is in this manner]{.underline}, he
concludes, [that US liberalism has **excluded various subaltern
groups**, from **African-American slaves** to **colonial-era
Filipinos**]{.underline}.

To the critique exemplified by Mehta and Go, I offer two replies. First,
[liberalism's universalism **does not necessarily lead to
colonialism**]{.underline}. In fact, [is it **reasonable** for a liberal
who believes in rational deliberation to **violently impose a set of
beliefs** on entire peoples? Scholars]{.underline} like Mehta [are
**wont to emphasize the universalizing desires** of
liberalism]{.underline} (its first face), [but they have **neglected its
other face**]{.underline}, what Gray calls [liberalism as **modus
vivendi**---a liberalism that allows for "**common institutions** in
which **many forms of life can coexist**"]{.underline} (2000, 6). [A
modus vivendi **cannot be colonialism**. And **neither** is colonialism
a way of **ordering liberty through institutions** that enhance
individual and collective freedoms]{.underline}. I must concede that [at
various points in liberalism's history, the pendulum has swung towards
its more universalizing tendencies. Yet to contend]{.underline}, as
anti-liberal postcolonial theorists do, [that liberalism is a
**universalizing project** that imposes itself on divergent belief
systems relies on an **incomplete vision** of the liberal
project]{.underline}.

A second reply relates to simple logic. [It is, of course, true that
liberalism creates "**others**." But **what political movement is
bereft** of an inside and outside?]{.underline} Marxism constructs the
proletariat in relation to the bourgeoisie, nationalism has foreigners,
various forms of identity politics insist on the primacy of specific
subject positions over others, and religions have non-believers. [In the
sense that it sees the world through a political subject, liberalism is
**no different** from other philosophies that create bonds of community.
And while philosophers have theorized **more fluid conceptions** of
political belonging]{.underline}--- Deleuze and Guattari's "rhizomatic"
subjectivity (1988), which inspired Hardt and Negri's conception of the
amorphous "multitude" (2005)---[it is **not clear** that these ideas
have produced **long-term movements** or **concrete
agendas**]{.underline}, especially in the Global South.

[The second claim is that liberalism is]{.underline} a modernist credo
external to the experiences of the Global South and postcolonies and
thus out of sync with the necessities of today. We have already noted
how de Sousa Santos views the "indifference" of liberalism as anathema
to the radical needs of the South. And we have also examined how the
Comaroffs view liberalism as [a "parochial" remnant of Euro-American
modernity]{.underline} inapplicable to the Global South, [both because
it **comes from Europe** and **America**, and because it is anchored on
**outdated beliefs** about the **rule of law**]{.underline}. Elsewhere,
[the Comaroffs contend that the liberal belief in "the **capacity for
constitutionalism** and **contract**, **rights** and **legal remedies**
to accomplish order, **civility**, **justice**, **empowerment**" is a
form of legal "**fetishism**" that is ultimately
"**chimerical**,"]{.underline} especially in postcolonial contexts. This
kind of politics, then, becomes nothing but a pyramid scheme: "The more
it is indulged, the more it is required" (2001, 38).

Again I offer two replies. First, [a history of liberalism shows that
its potency as a political credo is **not limited to the
West**]{.underline}. Of course, [we **cannot deny** that much of
liberalism's early history lies in Europe and that the US became a major
hub of liberal experimentation]{.underline}; liberalism's place in what
the Comaroffs label the "Euro-American" past is not up for debate. [But
because liberalism may encompass **shifting subjectivities**, political
actors have been able to **redefine liberalism within colonial
contexts**]{.underline}. Mehta is correct that [imperialists deployed
liberal rhetoric to justify expansionist policy. Nevertheless, the
**earliest anti-colonial movements** were likewise **liberal in
nature**, and]{.underline}, I would argue, [**more in line** with the
tenets of classical liberalism]{.underline}. [Anti-colonial radicals in
Spanish America]{.underline}, as Richard J. Evans notes,
[**corresponded** and **collaborated** with European liberals, forming a
**liberal** and **radical** "international whose connections **spanned
the Atlantic**"]{.underline} (2016, 17).

Spain was a crucial node in this liberal internationalism; its various
patriotic societies, which emerged after the Napoleonic wars, inspired
similar organizations throughout the continent (Evans 2016, 39). It is
thus unsurprising that European liberalism spread to Asia through the
Spanish colony of the Philippines. Historians John Schumacher (1991, 31)
and Nick Joaquin (2005, 24--35) have posited that the propaganda
movement that paved the way for the Philippine revolution of 1896 (the
first anti-colonial revolution in Asia) was birthed within a local
liberal tradition that mixed with nationalist anti-colonialism. Recent
evidence has shown, moreover, that, like the French revolution, the
Philippine revolution was also liberal in character.3

[Critics view liberalism through the eyes of "liberal" imperialists, but
they are **silent** about how colonized actors themselves **articulated
concepts of liberty** and **human rights** from their subaltern
positions]{.underline}. Philippine national hero, the polymath novelist
and polemicist [**Jose Rizal**, saw in]{.underline} the [liberal
tenets]{.underline} of the French declaration of rights [a **blueprint
for a society after colonialism**]{.underline}, translating the
declaration for his countrymen during a sojourn in Hong Kong (Schumacher
1997, 270). [He was a liberal who **criticized colonialism on liberal
grounds** and believed that liberals who abetted colonial rule were
**untrue to their principles**]{.underline}. Writing in 1890, Rizal
claimed that if Spanish liberals in the Philippines had "more faith in
their ideals," they would resist the colonial rule of Catholic friars
and that "modern ideas" would not "be asphyxiated upon touching the
shores of Manila" (1964, 289).

[If it is true that the one consistent feature of liberalism's history
has been the "**constant opposition to assorted tyrannies**," then the
**more authentic liberals** were those in colonial contexts, who argued
that **colonialism was tyranny writ large**]{.underline} (Ryan 2012,
28). For the Filipino propagandists, [there was a sense that
**liberalism could be purified** in colonial contexts]{.underline}.4
"Liberals" in positions of power more easily succumb to tyranny, thereby
turning their backs on their very own principles. [A **correction of
liberalism** could thus occur in places of disempowerment. What prevents
Global South thinkers from **appropriating this liberal
anti-colonialism** today? This appropriation **would not be a wholesale
adoption of modernity** and **Enlightenment**. Rather]{.underline}, as
in the case of Filipino propagandists, [it would begin by **grappling
with rights** and **liberties** in the postcolony, seeing how these can
be **enhanced** and **purified** in these new contexts]{.underline}.

My second reply to the argument about liberalism's inapplicability to
the postcolonial politics of the present rests on pragmatism. [Modernist
politics]{.underline} based on principles like constitutionalism [may be
**wanting**, but **what are our alternatives**?]{.underline} This is a
trite response, but [it **bears repeating**, especially in the context
of the Global South, where **people starve** and **immediate**, even
**palliative**, **change is urgent**. Reformism is **not anathema** to
postcolonial societies. A **fairer legal system** that allows the poor
to be **treated equal under the law**--- one that **affords them worthy
defenses** in criminal trials, one that prevents them from being
**kicked off their land** and **denied their property**---is a
**sustainable goal** that we **must aspire for**]{.underline}. And the
Global South would do well to aspire for social services like
state-sponsored healthcare (more dysfunctional in the Philippines than
even the United States) that curb the worst violences of the
"neoliberalism" that anti-liberals decry.

[Presumably, the advocates of non-modernist anti-liberalism]{.underline}
from the Global South [anchor their vision of change on a **renewed
revolutionary politics** that **challenges the core structures** of
contemporary capitalist societies. For them, another world is possible.
But **what are political actors in the Global South left to do** while
the theoreticians figure out **how** and **when** the revolutionary
break will occur? Liberalism promotes a baseline of **slow** yet
**functional politics** that **tempers the nihilism** of much radical
thinking. But, a **stable base** of political rights may **open new
possibilities** that may also **tickle our collective imaginations**.
Slow **does not mean uninspiring**]{.underline}.

There is also evidence to support the idea that in some instances,
states are emphasising non-traditional security issues and cooperation
associated with it as a mechanism for consolidating strategic
partnerships driven by more traditional strategic concerns. This might
be applied to the example of responses to the 2004 tsunami. Here, the
United States, Japan, India and Australia established a coalition to
coordinate aid delivery, in the process solidifying strategic relations
while responding to regional disaster. Such a development suggests
challenges associated with making clear distinctions between a
traditional and non-security agenda, challenges heightened if
non-traditional security is still viewed through the lens of state
security.4

[These issues raise important questions about the politics of security
as applied to critical approaches, especially those that wish to
contribute to **debates** about security practices: [should our **aim**
be to **speak**]{.mark} **truth to power** and articulate a bold vision
for **[substantially different sets of approaches and actors]{.mark}**,
**[or]{.mark}** to **[engage]{.mark}** those **[institutions]{.mark}**
and actors [with]{.mark} the [capacity to **enact change**]{.mark},
**attempting [to encourage more progressive practices]{.mark} in the

binary]{.mark}** in the sense that **scholarship** (**and** individual
**[scholars]{.mark}**) [can **do both**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But it
serves to remind us of the importance of engaging with the politics of
security. This is central to Lee Wilson's discussion of dynamics and
practices of security in Indonesia in this special issue.
[**Ultimately**, we [should]{.mark} be in a position to [**articulate**
grounds for **incremental progressive change** to **those with the power

and **reflexivity** -- combined with acceptance of a division of

go some way to addressing]{.underline}.

These [critical observations on the current security constellation
impart]{.underline} some [valuable warnings, some of which]{.underline},
as noted, [are shared by liberal critics]{.underline} of the 'war on
terror'. They suggest, [first and foremost, that democratic societies
risk spiralling into a vicious circle of terror--fear--repression whose
all too likely consequence is the erosion, perhaps even demise, of
democratic government and the rule of law]{.underline} (Rorty 2004). [As
political elites respond]{.underline} to acts of terror [with 'security
measures' that seek to assuage public insecurity]{.underline} (and
anger) [by further empowering police and military institutions, they do
several things: not only do they direct the resources of the partisan
state at already]{.underline} often unpopular and [over-policed minority
populations (both at home and abroad); they also institutionalize public
anxiety in ways that make it difficult to envisage cultural conditions
that will permit 'temporary' exceptional measures to be repealed, and
leave themselves with little practical choice but to respond to the next
terrorist attack with yet more -- still tougher -- 'security
solutions']{.underline}. As each 'ordering measure brings into being new
ambiguities and ambivalences which call for further measures, the chase
never ends' (Bauman and Tester 2001: 79; see, also, Dillon 1996: 127).

[For liberals the practical task is to find ways of responding
to]{.underline} terror (and the [fear]{.underline} and loathing that it
generates, or reinforces, or renews) [in ways that break out of this
insecurity-heightening, democracy-corroding spiral]{.underline} (see,
for example, Ackerman 2004; Ignatieff 2004; Dyzenhaus and Hunt
forthcoming). This too, more broadly, is the impulse that informs this
book -- [one that holds that **[it is possible]{.mark}** in this field
[to]{.mark} envisage and [create **virtuous circles** that **both**
**civilize security** **and** **release the civilizing potential of
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The variant of state
[scepticism]{.underline} we have been concerned with here [presses,
however, a more disquieting claim -- one that presents a serious
critique of such possibilities]{.underline}. [From this perspective
there is no obvious route away from a world in which exceptionalism has
become]{.underline} what Agamben (2004a: 2 and passim) calls ['the
dominant paradigm of government]{.underline} in contemporary politics'
-- [and certainly not one which travels under the banner of
security]{.underline}. We are [faced with]{.underline} what looks set to
become an [unceasing war]{.underline} against terror [in which partisan,
exceptional states name and chase new enemies, fortify borders as they
violate them, suspend law in the name of law, and undermine democracy in
an effort to save it]{.underline}. [How, in such a world,
the]{.underline} leftist state [sceptic asks, can we speak meaningfully
about, let alone begin to construct, a socially coherent project of
collective security?]{.underline}

Against security?

The strands of radical thought outlined in this chapter offer a cogent
critique of the state and its securitizing practices. It is a critique
that appears able to capture important aspects of a historical record
that has seen states time and again, in both authoritarian and
democratic contexts, allocate the benefits and burdens of policing in
ways that systematically protect the security interests of powerful
constituencies at the expense of those of the poor and dispossessed. It
supplies, in addition, a cogent account of the dangers of placing
security at the ideological heart of government, of the capacity of
security politics to colonize public policy and pervade social life in
ways that threaten democratic values and sustain fear-laden,
other-disregarding forms of political subjectivity and collective
identity. In these respects, this variant of state scepticism offers a
critique of the operation and effects of state power that in many
significant respects we share (N. Walker 2000; Loader 2002). But it also
poses what are undoubtedly some profound challenges to the position we
wish here to construct and defend. If we are to make a persuasive case
for both the good of security, and the indispensability of the state to
the production of that good, then we need to find a means of rising to
them.

[These objections then are far from trivial]{.underline}, and we have
not devoted this chapter to them simply in order to knock them down.
[But they nonetheless arise from a standpoint that is not itself without
shortcomings]{.underline}, as we hope to show in meeting them. As a
prelude to the more sustained effort along these lines that we offer in
part II, let us consider briefly what these shortcomings are. For
analytic purposes, they may usefully be put into three groups.

[This radical variant of state [scepticism]{.mark} tends]{.underline},
first of all, [to [**underplay** the **openness of political
systems**]{.mark} and the theoretical and political prospects that this
affords]{.underline}. [It [displays]{.mark}, in particular, [a
**structural fatalism** that **overlooks**]{.mark} the **overlap**
between the **production of specific and general order**, such [that
disadvantaged groups]{.mark} and communities [have a **considerable
stake** not only in **controlling state power**, but]{.mark} also in
**[using public resources]{.mark}** (**[including policing
resources]{.mark}**) **[as a means of generating more secure forms
of]{.mark} economic and [social existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It
also remains **insufficiently attentive** to how the mix between general
and specific order (the extent, in other words, to which
**[policing]{.mark}** is shaped by **common** as well as **factional**
interests) [is **conditioned by political struggle**]{.mark} and the
**varieties of [institutional settlement]{.mark}** to which this gives
rise, [thereby **varying** over **time** and between
**polities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much [the same point]{.underline},
moreover, [can be directed at the radical [critique of the violence that
underpins **liberal**]{.mark} **political [orders]{.mark}** that aim to
be free of such violence]{.underline}. One finds here a quite proper
insistence on the troubling conundrum that democratic polities
ultimately depend upon coercion to enforce collective decisions and
protect democratic institutions. But [this point is hammered home in
terms that are [**overly sweeping** and
**reductionist**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- often, as in the writings of
Agamben (2004a), as a philosophical claim that invites but resists
sociological scrutiny. [If 'there is always a violence at the heart of
every form of political and legal authority']{.underline} (Newman 2004:
575), [upon what grounds can we distinguish between, or develop a
critique of, the security-seeking practices of particular states -- and
why would we bother?]{.underline}

[Radical anti-statism evinces]{.underline}, secondly, [a preference for
social and political **criticism** **over** social and political
**reconstruction**]{.underline}. [It favours a politics that
**[privileges]{.mark}** the monitoring, **[exposure and
critique]{.mark}** of the systematic biases of state power]{.underline}
(as, for instance, in the indefatigable efforts of the British-based NGO
Statewatch), [one that implicitly or expressly holds that **'security'**
is **so stained** by its uncivil association with the (military and
police) state that the only available radical strategy is to destabilize
the term itself, while contesting the practices that are enacted under
its name]{.underline} (Dalby 1997: 6; see, also, Dillon 1996: ch. 1).
[There can, from this vantage point, be no progressive democratic
politics aimed at civilizing security. Rather, one is [left with]{.mark}
a politics of critique, and [a **failure of political imagination**,
that **leaves radically underspecified** the **feasible or desirable
alternatives**]{.mark} to current institutional configurations and
practices, [or else **merely gestures towards the possibility of
transcendent forms**]{.mark} of non-state communal ordering]{.underline}
-- as in George Rikagos's (2002: 150) claim that 'the only real
alternatives to current policing practices are pre-capitalist,
non-commodified security arrangements'.

[Finally, one finds what we think of as [a **one-sided appraisal** of
the **sources of inequality and insecurity**]{.mark} in the world
today]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} leftist anti-statist sensibility
[tends]{.underline}, in the ways we have demonstrated, [towards an
account of social injustice that **[views it as the product of the
state's]{.mark} malign and [coercive interventions]{.mark}** [rather
than]{.mark} of [its **impotence and neglect**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Here one finds a curious parallel with the neo-liberalism considered in
the last chapter -- the state remains the problem. But one also
encounters a critique of security politics that views it as tied to the
production of authoritarian government -- [[**as if** **security** is in
some **essential** fashion **inimical to democracy**]{.mark} and human
rights]{.underline}. [Here the radical critic begins to inhabit similar
ground to that occupied by]{.underline} what we characterized in chapter
1 as [the **'security lobby'**]{.underline}. [They assess the landscape
very differently and commit to diametrically opposed political purposes.
But they **cling** commonly and tenaciously to the **belief** that
**security**]{.underline} stands **[opposed to liberty]{.underline}**.

[Our aim]{.underline}, in part II, [is to [**move beyond** these]{.mark}
positions and **[oppositions]{.mark}**: first, by [retrieving]{.mark}
the idea of [**security as a public good** that]{.mark} is axiomatic
both to the production of other goods (most directly, liberty) and to
the constitution of democratic political communities; second, by arguing
that the production of this good [demands **not**]{.mark} the [wholesale
**critique and transcendence**]{.mark} of state forms, [but **more
robust regulatory interventions**]{.mark} by democratized state
institutions]{.underline}. We must first, however, factor into our
positive case two further critiques of the state, starting with the
claim that it is a cultural monolith.

### AT: ALT -- Poststructuralism

#### The ALT [solves nothing]{.underline} -- BUT [even if]{.underline} it did, [transition wars]{.underline} [outweigh]{.underline}

Perhaps more [alarming]{.underline} though [is the outright
violence]{.underline} Ashley [recommends in response to]{.underline}
what at best seem trite, if not [imagined, injustices]{.underline}.
[[Inculpating]{.mark} modernity, **[positivism]{.mark}**, technical
rationality, or realism [with **violence**, **racism**, **war**]{.mark},
and countless other crimes]{.underline} not only smacks of
anthropomorphism but, as demonstrated by Ashley's torturous prose and
reasoning, [[requires a **dubious logic**]{.mark} to make such
connections in the first place]{.underline}. [[Are we really to believe
that]{.mark} ethereal entities like positivism, modernism, or realism
emanate a "violence" that marginalizes dissidents?]{.underline} Indeed,
where is this violence, repression, and marginalization? As
self-professed dissidents supposedly exiled from the discipline, Ashley
and Walker appear remarkably well integrated into the academy---vocal,
published, and at the center of the Third Debate and the forefront of
theoretical research. Likewise, is Ashley seriously [suggesting that,
[on the basis of this largely **imagined violence**]{.mark}, **[global
transformation]{.mark}** (perhaps [even **revolutionary
violence**]{.mark}) [is]{.mark} a [**necessary**, let alone
**desirable**]{.mark}, response**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Has [the
rationale for emancipation or the fight for justice been reduced to such
vacuous revolutionary slogans as "Down with positivism and
rationality"]{.underline}? The point is surely trite. [Apart from
members of the academy, who has heard of positivism and who for a moment
imagines that they need to be emancipated from it, or from modernity,
rationality, or realism for that matter?]{.underline} In an era of
unprecedented change and turmoil, of new political and military
configurations, of wrar in the Balkans and ethnic cleansing, is Ashley
really [suggesting [that]{.mark} some of [the **greatest threats facing
humankind**]{.mark} or some of the great moments of history **[rest on
such innocuous and largely unknown nonrealities like
positivism]{.mark}** and realism**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [These are
imagined and fictitious enemies, [**theoretical fabrications** that
represent **arcane, self-serving debates**]{.mark} superfluous to the
lives of most people and, arguably, to most issues of importance in
international relations]{.underline}.

More is the pity that such irrational and obviously abstruse debate
should so occupy us at a time of great global turmoil. That it does and
continues to do so reflects our lack of judicious criteria for
evaluating theory and, more importantly, the lack of attachment
theorists have to the real world. [Certainly it is right and proper that
we ponder the depths of our theoretical imaginations]{.underline},
engage in epistemological and ontological debate, and analyze the
sociology of our knowledge.37 [But [to suppose]{.mark} that [this is the
**only task** of international theory, **let alone the most
important**]{.mark} one]{.underline}, smacks of intellectual elitism and
[[displays]{.mark} a certain [**contempt for those who search for
guidance** in]{.mark} their **[daily struggles]{.mark}** as actors [in
international politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [What does]{.underline}
Ashley's project, his [deconstructive efforts, or valiant fight against
positivism say to the truly marginalized, oppressed, and destitute?
[**How** does it]{.mark} help **[solve]{.mark}** the plight of the poor,
the displaced refugees, the casualties of war, or the emigres of death
squads**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Does it in any wray speak to those
whose actions and thoughts comprise the policy and practice of
international relations?

On all these questions one must answer no. This is not to say, of
course, that all theory should be judged by its technical rationality
and problem-solving capacity as Ashley forcefully argues. But [[to
suppose]{.mark} that [**problem-solving technical theory** is **not
necessary**---or]{.mark} is in some way **[bad]{.mark}**---is a
contemptuous position that **[abrogates any hope of solving]{.mark}**
some of [the **nightmarish realities** that **millions confront
daily**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Holsti argues, we need ask of these
theorists and their theories the ultimate question, "So what?" To what
purpose do they deconstruct, problcmatize, destabilize, undermine,
ridicule, and belittle modernist and rationalist approaches? [Does this
get us any further, make the world any better, or enhance the human
condition? In what sense can this "**debate** toward \[[a]{.mark}\]
**[bottomless pit of epistemology and metaphysics]{.mark}**" be judged
pertinent, relevant, **helpful**, or cogent to **anyone** other than
those foolish enough to be **scholastically excited** by abstract and
recondite **debate.**]{.underline}38

Contrary to Ashley's assertions, then, [a poststructural approach fails
to empower the marginalized and, in fact, abandons them]{.underline}.
[Rather than analyze the political economy of power, wealth, oppression,
production, or international relations and render an intelligible
understanding of these processes]{.underline}, Ashley succeeds in
ostracizing those he portends to represent by delivering an obscure and
highly convoluted discourse. If Ashley wishes to chastise structural
realism for its abstractness and detachment, he must be prepared also to
face similar criticism, especially when he so adamantly intends his work
to address the real life plight of those w ho struggle at marginal
places.

There are also a host of technological and logistical questions that
plague George's scheme and make problematic his recommendations. For
example, through what medium are those on the fringes of the
international system going to speak to the world? Although it may be
true that the third world has now been integrated into the global polity
via the advent of technological innovations in communications, allowing
for remote access to information sources and the Internet, it also
remains true that the majority of those on the fringes continue to be
disenfranchised from such mediums, whether as a result of a lack of
economic resources, the prevalence of illiteracy, or social, cultural
and political circumstances that systemically exclude, women (among
others) from economic resources and certain political and social
freedoms. Need we remind George that social, political, and individual
autonomy is at a minimum in these parts of the world, and [an
intellectual approach as controversial as postmodernism is **[not likely
to achieve]{.mark}**]{.underline} the sorts of
**[[goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** that George optimistically foreshadows.
Indeed, [on **practical questions**]{.underline} such as these, [matters
otherwise central to the success of postmodern visions]{.underline},
George [prefers to be **vague**, suggesting instead that the intricacies
of such details will somehow work themselves out in a manner
satisfactory to all]{.underline}. [Such a position reveals]{.underline}
George's [latent idealism and underscores how]{.underline} George's
[schema is]{.underline} an intellectual one: [a theory of international
politics written for other theorists of international
politics]{.underline}. George's [audience is thus a **very limited and
elite audience** and begs the question of whether a senior, middle-class
scholar]{.underline} in the intellectual heartland of Australia [can do
anything of real substance to aid the truly marginalized and
oppressed]{.underline}. How is it possible to put oneself in the shoes
of the "other," to advocate on his or her behalf, when such is done from
a position of affluence, unrelated to and far removed from the
experiences of those whom George otherwise champions? [Ideals are all
good and well, but it is hard to imagine that the computer keyboard is
mightier than the sword, and **[hard to see how a small, elite]{.mark},
affluent [assortment of intellectuals is going to generate the type of
political momentum necessary]{.mark}** to allow those on the fringes to
speak and be heard!]{.underline} 1 .

[Moreover, **why** should we **assume** that **states** and individuals
want to listen and **will listen**]{.underline} to what the marginalized
and the oppressed have to say? There is precious little evidence to
suggest that "listening" is something the advanced capitalist countries
do very well at all. Indeed, one of the allegations so forcefully
alleged by Muslim fundamentalists as justification for the terrorist
attacks of September I I is precisely that the West, and America in
particular, are deaf to the disenfranchised and impoverished in the
world. Certainly, there are agencies and individuals who are sensitive
to the needs of the "marginalized" and who champion institutional forums
where indigenous voices can be heard. But on even the most optimistic
reckoning, such forums and institutions represent the exception, not the
rule, and remain in the minority if not dwarfed by those institutions
that represent Western, first world interests. To be sure, this is a
realist power-political image of the current configuration of the global
polity, but one apparently, and ironically, endorsed by George if only
because it speaks to the realities of the marginalized, the imposed
silences, and the multitude of oppressions on which George founds his
call for a postmodern ethic.

[Recognizing such realities]{.underline}, however, [does not
explain]{.underline} George's penchant for [ignoring them entirely,
especially in terms of the structural rigidities they pose for
meaningful reform]{.underline}. Indeed, George's [**[desire to move to a
new "space beyond I]{.mark}**nternational **[R]{.mark}**elations" smacks
of **[wishful idealism]{.mark}**, **[ignoring]{.mark} the current
configuration of [global political relations and power
distribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}; of the incessant ideological power
of hyperindividualism, consumerism, advertising, Hollywood images, and
fashion icons; and of the innate power bestowed on the (institutional)
barons of global finance, trade, and transnational production. George
[seems to [have **little appreciation of the structural impediments
such**]{.mark} **institutions [pose for radical
change]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the type he so fiercely advocates.
[Revolutionary change]{.underline} of the kind desired by George
[ignores that fact that many individuals are not disposed to concerns
beyond their family, friends, and daily work lives. And institutional,
**structural transformation [requires organized effort, mass popular
support]{.mark}**, and dogged single-mindedness if societal norms are to
be challenged, institutional reform enacted]{.underline}, consumer
tastes altered, [and political sensibilities reformed]{.underline}.
Convincing Nike that there is something intrinsically wrong with paying
Indonesian workers a few dollars a week to manufacture shoes for the
global market requires considerably more effort than postmodern
platitudes and/or moral indignation. The cycle of wealth creation and
distribution that sees Michael Jordan receive multimillion dollar
contracts to inspire demand for Nike products, while the foot soldiers
in the factory eke out a meager existence producing these same products
is not easily, or realistically, challenged by pronouncements of moving
beyond International Relations to a new, nicer, gentler nirvana.

[More generally]{.underline}, of course, what George **[[fails to
consider]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [the problem of [**apathy**
and]{.mark} of **[how we get people to care about]{.mark} the plight of
[others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What do we with the CEOs of
multinational corporations, stockbrokers, accountants, ctory workers,
and the unemployed, who, by and large, fail to consider the omeless and
destitute in their own countries, let alone in places they have never
isited and are never likely to visit? [**[Moral indignation rarely
translates into action]{.mark}**, and **apathy** about the plight of
others is a **structural impediment as strong any** idea, **theory**, or
writing]{.underline}. What George's treatise thus [fails to
consider]{.underline} is [how we overcome this, and how we get others to
listen]{.underline}. He needs to explain how the social, political,
psychological, and moral structures that define the parameters of
existence for the many millions of ordinary citizens in the first world,
and that deflects attention from the marginalized and the oppressed can
be broken down. Unfortunately, there is little to indicate that George
has thought much about this, suggesting that his [[**commitment to
postmodern theory** is **not likely to make much
difference**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In fact, **[in the academy]{.mark}**
the postmodern light is **[already beginning to dim]{.mark}** in certain
quarters, having **[registered scarcely a glimmer in the broader
polity]{.mark}**, where, if change was to ensue, it needed to burn
brightly]{.underline}. [Even among those versed in the nomenclature of
scholarly debate, **theorists of international politics remain
skeptical** of the value of postmodern discourse, by and large rejecting
it. This **does not portend well** for postmodern visionaries and the
future of postmodern discourse]{.underline}. But can George really be
surprised by this? After all, his discourse indicts the "backward
discipline" for complicity in crimes against humanity, calling for a
repudiation of realism and with it a repudiation of the lifelong beliefs
and writings of eminent theorists like Kenneth Waltz, Robert Gilpin, and
Stephen Krasner who have otherwise defined the parameters of the
discipline, its projects, and research agendas. Can George really expect
discipline-wide capitulation to an intellectual diaspora that would see
theorists repudiate their beliefs and works in order to take up the
creed of postmodernism, as vague, open-ended, and indeterminate as it
is? Without a clear and credible plan of how to get from "incarceration
and closure" to intellectual freedom, creativity, and openness, George's
postmodern musings have understandably attracted few disciples.

#### Poststructural analysis [fails]{.underline}

/GoGreen!

However, having said that, the problem is Jackson's own theoretical
underpinning, his own justification for the importance of language. If
he was merely proposing that the understanding of language as one of
many causal factors is important that would be fine. But he is not.
[[The]{.mark} epistemological and **theoretical [framework]{.mark}** of
his argument [means the **ONLY thing we should look at is
language**]{.mark}]{.underline} and this is the problem.\[ii\] Rather
than being a fairly simple, but nonetheless valid, argument, because of
the theoretical justification it actually becomes an almost nonsensical.

My response is roughly laid out in four parts. Firstly I will argue that
[[such methodology]{.underline}]{.mark}, in isolation, [[is]{.mark}
fundamentally **[reductionist]{.mark}**]{.underline} with a theoretical
underpinning that does not conceal this simplicity. Secondly, that [a
strict use of [**post-structural discourse analysis** results in an
**epistemological cul-de-sac**]{.mark} in which the writer cannot
actually say anything. Moreover the reader has no reason to accept
anything that has been written. The result is **[at best]{.mark}** an
explanation that remains as **[equally valid as any other]{.mark}
possible [interpretation]{.mark}** and at worse a work that **[retains
no critical force]{.mark}** whatsoever]{.underline}. Thirdly, [possible
arguments in response to this charge; that such approaches provide a
more acceptable explanation than others are]{.underline}, in effect,
[both a tacit acceptance of the poverty of force within the approach
[and]{.mark} of the [**complete lack of understanding** of the
**identifiable effects of the real world**]{.mark}]{.underline} around
us; thus [[highlighting]{.mark} the [contradictions]{.mark}
with[in]{.mark} post-structural claims to be **[moving beyond]{.mark}**
traditional **[causality]{.mark}**, re-affirming that [rather
than]{.mark} pursuing [a **post-structural** approach we should continue
to employ]{.mark} the **[traditional
methodologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} with[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
History, Politics and [**[I]{.mark}**nternational
**[R]{.mark}**elations]{.underline}. Finally as a consequence of these
limitations I will argue that the post-structural call for
'intertextuals' must be practiced rather than merely preached and that
an understanding and utilisation of all possible theoretical approaches
must be maintained if academic writing is to remain useful rather than
self-contained and narrative. Ultimately I conclude that whilst
undeniably of some value, post-structural approaches are at best a
footnote in our understanding.

The first major problem then is that [historiographically **discourse
analysis** is **so capacious** as to be largely of **little
use**]{.underline}. [The process of inscription identity, of discourse
development is not given any political or historical context, it is
argued that it just works, is simply a universal
phenomenon]{.underline}. [It is **history that explains everything and
therefore actually explains nothing**]{.underline}.

To be specific [[**if** the U.S. and every other nation is **continually
reproducing identities** through **'othering'** it is a
**constant**]{.mark} and universal phenomenon that [**fails to help us
understand at all** why]{.mark} one result of the othering [turned
out]{.mark} one way and [differently]{.mark} at another
time]{.underline}. For example, how could one explain how the process
resulted in the 2003 invasion of Iraq but didn't produce a similar
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 when that country (and by the logic of
the Regan administrations discourse) the West was threatened by the
'Evil Empire'. By the logical of discourse analysis in both cases these
policies were the result of politicians being able to discipline and
control the political agenda to produce the outcomes. So why were the
outcomes not the same? To reiterate the point how do we explain that the
language of the War on Terror actually managed to result in the eventual
Afghan invasion in 2002? Surely it is impossible to explain how George
W. Bush was able to convince his people (and incidentally the U.N and
Nato) to support a war in Afghanistan without referring to a simple fact
outside of the discourse; the fact that a known terrorist in Afghanistan
actually admitted to the murder of thousands of people on the 11h of
Sepetember 2001. The point is that [**[if]{.mark}** the **[discursive
'othering']{.mark}** of]{.underline} an 'alien' [people or group [is
what really gave]{.mark} the U.S. the opportunity to persue [the **war

not No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Or
Scotland? If the discourse is so powerfully useful in it's own right why
could it not have happened anywhere at any time and more often? Why
could the British government not have been able to justify an armed
invasion and regime change in Northern Ireland throughout the terrorist
violence of the 1980's? Surely they could have just employed the same
discursive trickery as George W. Bush? Jackson is absolutely right when
he points out that the actuall threat posed by Afghanistan or Iraq today
may have been thoroughly misguided and conflated and that there must be
more to explain why those wars were enacted at that time. [Unfortunately

### AT: ALT -- Abolish NATO

What are the implications of the growing capabilities and dissemination
of AI, ML and BD for NATO? Is the Atlantic Alliance powerless when
[**[faced with]{.mark}** this wave of **[technological
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or could it adopt some measures to handle
and address the ensuing challenges and opportunities? And [**[what
should Allies do?]{.mark}** Should they pursue **[arms control]{.mark}**
or promote **[r]{.mark}**esearch **[and d]{.mark}**evelopment, [address
**legal** and **ethical** questions]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} just focus on
the **[tactical integration]{.mark}** of these new
technologies**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} How can the Allies exploit their
combined, but diverse, set of skills, capabilities and experiences so as
to harness the power of AI?

Building on the previous discussion of AI as a GPT, it appears that the
challenge for NATO is subtle, multifaceted and significant. First, in an
age of accelerating technological change and growing domain
applicability, catching up with industry leaders and innovators becomes
more and more difficult for those that lag behind.73 This means that
[**[waiting is not a solution]{.mark}** -- [even though
acting]{.mark}]{.underline} prematurely, in a realm of great
uncertainty, [[is]{.mark} inherently difficult and
[risky]{.mark}]{.underline}.74 Second, governments [**[cannot
expect]{.mark}** that **[individuals]{.mark}**, firms [and
**organizations** will be able to]{.mark} embrace and [successfully
exploit]{.mark} the new wave of [tech]{.mark}nological
[transformation]{.mark} **[alone]{.mark}**, without advice, support,
direction, vision or investments in infrastructure]{.underline}. Third,
while [some countries will have an advantage, others will find the
transition more difficult]{.underline}. Regardless of this,
technological transitions do not occur in a vacuum, as they require the
alignment of incentives among a multiplicity of actors, organizations
and institutions, as well as the provision of complementary services and
goods for the new technologies to flourish and be adopted.75 Fourth, and
more important [for [**NATO**, **without**]{.mark}]{.underline}
coordinating and [**[cooperating]{.mark}** on]{.underline} their
investments in [the necessary complementary assets, goods and services,
Allies could find themselves [having to **face additional
hurdles**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What types of problem could emerge? Technology-generated efficiency
gains in production lead to lower prices. However, lower prices lead to
increases in demand -- because the relative price of substitute goods
(rivals) increases.76 Over the past decade, AI -- and, in particular, ML
-- has made a particular activity, prediction, cheaper: it is reasonable
to forecast that this trend will continue in the future.77 As AI becomes
cheaper, however, the demand for AI-related services will increase, thus
leading to more demand for related necessities like AI specialists, AI
infrastructure (and 5G networks) and AI components (processors). This in
turn might well lead to scarcity and higher prices, thus pitching actors
against one another -- not unlike the early stages of the COVID-19
crisis, when individual self-interested actions led to collectively bad
outcomes.78 [In the context of a military alliance, the problem goes
much deeper, as it can [generate a **beggar-thy-neighbour** effect with
**allies competing**]{.mark} for the same scarce
resources]{.underline}.79 [Moreover, **without** consultation and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, Allies could end up developing different
technological solutions, with the risk of undermining compatibility and
interoperability. Similarly, they could [end up prioritizing some
problems over others, with the risk of developing multiple, different
and redundant solutions while neglecting other points in need of
attention]{.underline}.80 However, through intra-alliance coordination
and cooperation, as well as dialogue and consultation, secondary market
mechanisms and other approaches, NATO could provide an important
contribution to identify and address this type of problems.81

### AT: Threat Inflation

#### Our threats are [real]{.underline} and [objectively knowable]{.underline} -- [institutional incentives]{.underline} militate [against]{.underline} threat [inflation]{.underline}, [NOT for]{.underline}

Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, professor emeritus of the

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} underlying [[notion of]{.mark} "the
**[security bureaucracies]{.mark}** . . . **[looking for new
enemies]{.mark}**" [is]{.mark} a **[threadbare]{.mark} concept** that
has somehow taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical
left]{.underline} (viz. Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat
bank"), [to the liberal center]{.underline} (viz. Robert H. Johnson
\[1997\], who dismisses most alleged "threats" as "improbable dangers"),
[to libertarians]{.underline} (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter \[1992\], Vice
President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato Institute, who
wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What is [missing
from]{.mark} most analysts' [claims of "**threat inflation**]{.mark},"
however, [is a convincing theory of **why**]{.mark}]{.underline}, say,
[the American government significantly (not merely in excusable
rhetoric) might magnify and even invent threats (and, more seriously,
act on such inflated threat estimates)]{.underline}.

In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) [[suggests]{.mark} that such behavior
might [stem from]{.mark} military or national security bureaucrats'
[attempts to enhance]{.mark} their personal [**status** and]{.mark}
organizational [**budgets**, or]{.mark} even [from the]{.mark} influence
and dominance of "[the]{.mark}
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary-**[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[c]{.mark}**omplex"]{.underline}; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and
retaliating for the blowback from that empire keeps what President
Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in
the same section:

> In the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
> bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises"to satisfy
> parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
> projects---a.k.a. pork---funded by the government. And national
> security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
> opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182)

Thus, ["**bureaucratic-politics**" theory]{.underline}, which once made
several reputations (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin,
and Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an
entire sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 is put
into the service of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary.

[So, too]{.underline}, can a surprisingly cognate theory, ["**public
choice**,"]{.underline}6 which can be considered the right-wing analog
of the "bureaucratic-politics" model, and is a preferred interpretation
of governmental decision-making among libertarian observers. As Eland
(2004, 203) summarizes:

> Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the government itself can develop
> separate interests from its citizens. The government reflects the
> interests of powerful pressure groups and the interests of the
> bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although this problem
> occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more severe in
> foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies that
> affect them less directly.

There is, in this statement of public-choice theory, a certain
ambiguity, and a certain degree of contradiction: Bureaucrats are
supposedly, at the same time, subservient to societal interest groups
and autonomous from society in general.

This journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups---about what
strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.

Ironically, "public choice"---not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation---is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub- rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives.

My treatment of "role" differs from that of the bureaucratic-politics
theorists, whose model of the derivation of foreign policy depends
heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and specific identification of
the role- playing of organizationally situated individuals in a partly
conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that "results in" some policy
outcome. Even here, bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and
Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some players are not able to
articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics game because their
conception of their job does not legitimate such activity." This is a
crucial admission, and one that points--- empirically---to the need for
a broader and generic treatment of role.

Roles (all theorists state) give rise to "expectations" of performance.
My point is that [virtually every governmental role, and especially
[national-security roles]{.mark}, and particularly the roles of the
uniformed military, [embody]{.mark} expectations of devotion to the
"national interest"; rationality in the derivation of policy at every
functional level; and [**objectivity** in]{.mark} the [treatment
of]{.mark} parameters, especially external parameters such as
[**"threats"** and the **power** and **capabilities** of other
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Sub-rational models (such as "public choice") fail to take into account
even a partial dedication to the "national" interest (or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more paro- chial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the (perhaps
otherwise) self-seeking impulses of the individual. [Role-derived
behavior tends to be formalized and codified; relatively
[**transparent** and]{.mark} at least
**[peer-reviewed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so as to be consistent with
expectations; surviving the particular individual and transmitted to
successors and ancillaries; measured against a standard and thus
corrigible; defined in terms of the performed function and therefore
derived from the state function; and uncorrrupt, because personal
cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged.

[**My own direct observation** suggests that defense decision-makers
attempt to **["frame"]{.mark}** the structure of the
**[problems]{.mark}** that they try to solve [on the basis of the **most
accurate intel**]{.mark}**ligence**. They make it their business to know
where the threats come from. Thus, [threats are **not "socially
constructed"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values
are).

A major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process
is that much [security planning is done, not in vaguely undefined
circumstances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior,
but rather in structured and reviewed organizational
frameworks]{.underline}. Non-rationalities (which are bad for
understanding and prediction) tend to get filtered out. [[**People are
fired** for presenting **skewed analysis** and]{.mark} for making **[bad
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [[because something
important is riding on the **causal analysis**]{.mark} and the
**contingent prediction**]{.underline}.

For these reasons, "public choice" [does not have the "feel" of reality
to many critics who have participated in the structure of defense
decision-making. In that structure]{.underline}, obvious, and even
not-so-obvious, [[**"rent-seeking"** would]{.mark} not only be shameful;
it would [present a **severe risk of career
termination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as mentioned, the defense
bureaucracy is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent-seekers
to operate compared to opportunities for personal profit in the
commercial world. [A bureaucrat's very **self-placement** in these
reaches of **government** testifies either to a sincere commitment to
the national interest or to a **[lack]{.mark}** of sufficient
imagination to exploit [opportunities for **personal
profit**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The 'common-sense' view pervading recent [discussions of
**epistemology**]{.mark}, **ontology** and **methodology** in IR
[assert]{.mark}s [that **objectivity implies value-free
neutrality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, **objective social
inquiry has an inherent tendency to be critical**]{.underline}, in
various senses. **[[To the extent that objective knowledge provides a
better]{.mark} and more adequate [account of reality]{.mark} than other
ideas, such knowledge [is inherently critical]{.mark} (implicitly or
explicitly) of those ideas]{.underline}**. 30 In other words **[critical
social [inquiry does not]{.mark} (or not only) [manifest its
'criticalness' through]{.mark} self-claimed [labels]{.mark} of being
critical [or siding with the oppressed, but through]{.mark} the
substantive critique of prevailing ideas]{.underline}**. [Objective
social knowledge constitutes a specific form of criticism:
**[explanatory critique]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The critique [of
dominant ideas or ideologies is elaborated through providing a more
adequate explanation of aspects of the world, and in so doing exposing
what is wrong with the dominant ideology]{.underline}. This may also
entail revealing the social conditions which give rise to ideologies,
thus exposing the necessary and causal relation between particular
social relations and particular ideological conceptions. In societies
which are constituted by unequal structures of social relations giving
rise to unequal power and conflicting interests, [the reproduction of
those structured relations is in the interests of the powerful, whereas
transformation of existing structured relations is in the interests of
the weak]{.underline}. **[Because ideas inform social action they are
casually efficacious]{.underline}** [either in]{.underline} securing
[the reproduction of existing social relations]{.underline} (usually as
an unintended consequence of social practice), [or in]{.underline}
informing social action aimed at [transforming social
relations]{.underline}. This is why ideas cannot be 'neutral'. Ideas
which provide a misrepresentation of the nature of society, the causes
of unequal social conditions, and the conflicting interests of the weak
and powerful, will tend to help secure the reproduction of prevailing
social relations. Ideas which provide a more adequate account of the way
society is structured and how structured social relations produce
concrete conditions of inequality and exploitation can potentially
inform efforts to change those social relations. In this sense, ideas
which are false are ideological and, in serving to promote the
reproduction of the status quo and avoid attempts at radical change, are
in the interests of the powerful. An account which is objective will
contradict ideological ideas, implicitly or explicitly criticising them
for their false or flawed accounts of reality. The criticism here arises
not, or not only, from pointing out the coincidence between ideologies
and the interests of the powerful, nor from a prior normative stance of
solidarity with the oppressed, but from exposing the flaws in dominant
ideologies through a more adequate account of the nature and causes of
social conditions 31 . **[[A normative commitment to the oppressed must
entail a commitment to truth and objectivity, because]{.mark} true ideas
are in the interest of the oppressed, [false ideas are in the interest
of]{.mark} the [oppressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[the best way to declare solidarity with the oppressed is to declare
one's commitment to objective inquiry]{.underline}** 32 . As
Nzongola-Ntalaja (1986: 10) has put it: It is a question of whether one
analyses society from the standpoint of the **[dominant
groups]{.underline}**, who [**have a vested interest in mystifying** the
way **society** works]{.underline}, or from the standpoint of [ordinary
people]{.underline}, who [have nothing to lose from truthful analyses of
their predicament]{.underline}. [The **philosophical realist theory of
science**, objectivity and explanatory critique]{.underline} thus
[provides an alternative response to the relationship between knowledge
and power]{.underline}. [**Instead of choosing perspectives on the basis
of our ethical commitment to the cause of the oppressed** and to
emancipatory social change, **we should choose between contending ideas
on the basis of which provides a better account of objective social
reality**]{.underline}. This will inherently provide a critique of the
ideologies which, by virtue of their flawed account of the social world,
serve the interests of the powerful. Exemplars of explanatory critique
in International Relations are provided in the work of scholars such as
Siba Grovogui, James Gathii, Anthony Anghie, Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques
Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson, Robert Vitalis, Sankaran Krishna,
Michel-Rolph Trouillot 33 . Their work provides critiques of central
categories, theories and discourses in the theory and practice of IR and
narratives of world history, including assumptions about sovereignty,
international society, international law, global governance, the nature
of the state. They expose the ideological and racialised nature of
central aspects of IR through a critical examination of both the long
historical trajectory of imperial ideologies regarding colonized
peoples, and the actual practices of colonialism and decolonisation in
the constitution of international orders and local social conditions.
Their work identifies the flaws in current ideas by revealing how they
systematically misrepresent or ignore the actual history of social
change in Africa, the Caribbean and other regions of the Third World,
both past and present -- during both colonial and neo-colonial periods
of the imperial world order. Their work reveals how racism, violence,
exploitation and dispossession, colonialism and neo-colonialism have
been central to the making of contemporary international order and
contemporary doctrines of international law, sovereignty and rights, and
how such themes are glaring in their absence from histories and theories
of international relations and international history. [Objective social
knowledge which accurately depicts and explains social reality has these
qualities by virtue of its relation to its object, not its
subject]{.underline}. As Collier argues, "The science/ideology
distinction is an epistemological one, not a social one." (Collier 1979:
60). So, [for example, in the work of Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin,
the general perspective]{.underline} and knowledge [of]{.underline}
conditions in and [the history of Africa might be due]{.underline}
largely [to the African social origins of the authors]{.underline}.
[However the judgement that their accounts are superior]{.underline} to
those of mainstream IR [rests not on the fact that the authors are
African, but on the greater adequacy of their accounts]{.underline}
[with respect to]{.underline} the actual [historical and contemporary
production of conditions and change in Africa]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} in the Third World. The
criteria for choosing their accounts over others derives from the
relation between the ideas and their objects (what they are about), not
from the relation between the ideas and their subjects (who produced
them). It is vital to retain explicitly some commitment to objectivity
in social inquiry, to the notion that the proper criterion for judging
ideas about the world lies in what they say about the world, not whose
ideas they are. [A fundamental problem which underlies the origin and
reproduction of IR's eurocentricity]{.underline} [is the overwhelming
dominance of ideas produced in and by the west, and the wilful and
determined silencing of the voices and histories of the
colonised]{.underline}. [But the result of this fundamental problem is
flawed knowledge about the world]{.underline}. [**Eurocentricity** is
therefore a dual problem concerning both the authors and the content of
knowledge, and **cannot be resolved through normative commitments
alone**]{.underline}. It is not only the voices of the colonised, but
the histories of colonialism, which have been glaring in their absence
from the discipline of International Relations. [**Overcoming
eurocentricity** therefore **requires** not only concerted effort from
the centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised voices,
but also **commitment to correcting the flaws in prevailing knowledge**
-- and it is **not only 'the Other' who can and should elaborate this
critique**]{.underline}. A vitally important implication of objectivity
is that **[it is the responsibility of European and American, just as
much as non-American or non-European scholars, to decolonise
IR]{.underline}**. [The importance of objectivity]{.underline} in social
inquiry defended here [can]{.underline} perhaps [be seen as a form of
epistemological internationalism]{.underline}. [It is not necessary to
be African to attempt to tell a more accurate account of the history of
Europe's role in the making of the contemporary Africa]{.underline} and
the rest of the world, for example, [or to write counter-histories of
'the]{.underline} expansion of international society' which detail the
[systematic barbarity of]{.underline} so-called [Western
civilisation]{.underline}. It is not necessary to have been colonised to
recognise and document the violence, racism, genocide and dispossession
which have characterised European expansion over five hundred years.

### T/N -- Objectivity Good

#### The scientific truths that undergird our scholarship are real -- [poststructuralism is coopted]{.underline} by corporations and post-truth politicians to [worse]{.underline} material effect than anything we said and turns ALT solvency

Half a century ago, [constructionist claims played an important role in
[**critical scholarship**, showing]{.mark} how **analytical categories**
we take for granted as **universal truths** did not exist in other times
and places, and exposing how these categories were **exploited by elites
to exercise power** (e.g. **Foucault**]{.underline}, 1971). [Authors
like]{.underline} Wittgenstein, Benveniste [and **Lacan** exposed the
[articulations between **language** and **the way we understand
reality**, putting into question]{.mark} dominant forms of **realism**
that magnified the absolute and **[universal]{.mark}** character of
**[scientific truths]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this line of reasoning,
[intellectuals associated [with]{.mark} postmodern]{.underline}1 [and
[**post-structuralist** thinking]{.mark}, like]{.underline} Barthes,
**[Derrida]{.underline}**, Kristeva, **[Foucault]{.underline}**,
**[Deleuze]{.underline}**, **[Baudrillard]{.underline}**, Jameson, and
Lyotard [challenged established beliefs surrounding **scientific
panaceas** and the dogmas of modernity. In doing so they contributed to
erode beliefs in certainties, allegedly emanating from reason, that
**shielded the exercise of power** by endowing it with the
**unquestionable authority** of **scientific truth**]{.underline}.

[The **deconstructionist machinery** set in motion by these authors,
however, soon **[proved double edged]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Naïve
realism --the original target of this criticism-- fell in disgrace and
social constructionism gradually became the mainstream in cultural
studies. Eventually, and with some support of the media, vulgarized
variants of this criticism contributed to expand a generalized climate
of moral relativism, skepticism and cynicism that, in words by Lévy
(1987: 20), installed us in an obsessively modest way of thinking that
makes of uncertainty its last word, and which 'extreme relativism has
resulted in a generalized idiocy' (cited in Naredo, 2015). In another
critical account Sahlins (2002: 49) notes that 'one of the more poignant
aspects of the current postmodernist mood is the way it seems to
lobotomize some of our best graduate students, to stifle their
creativity for fear of making some interesting structural connection
\[...\] or a comparative generalization. The only safe essentialism left
to them is that there is no order to culture'. Critics suggest that
[epistemic relativisms that reduce interpretations of reality to mere
'narratives', 'discourses' and 'social constructs' have been
instrumental for today's generalized skepticism and
cynicism]{.underline} (Boghossian, 2007; Sokal & Bricmont, 1999; Zerzan,
1994). Naredo (2015) further notes that [[this **epistemic
climate**]{.mark}, initially **[conceived as]{.mark} a healthy
[critique]{.mark}** to established ideas, later [came to be **exploited

[With regard to ontological security, the distinction between security
and insecurity is]{.underline} the more **[critical]{.underline}** one.
[In a state of **ontological insecurity**, the Self experiences
**instability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[uncertainty of
being]{.underline}**. [Ontological insecurity refers to a]{.underline}
[state of **disruption**]{.underline} [where the Self has **lost its
anchor**]{.underline} [for the definition of its identity]{.underline}
[and,]{.underline} consequently, [its ability to sustain a narrative and
answer questions about doing, acting, and being (]{.underline}Kinnvall
2004). It may arise from deep uncertainty (Mitzen 2006a) and/or from the
failure to have its sense of Self affirmed by others (Zarakol 2010).
[Conversely, in a state of ontological security, the Self experiences a
**stable**, **certain**, and **consistent** social
existence]{.underline}, [where it remains in control about its identity
and capacity for action]{.underline}. While I do not rule out the
possibility of a state of ontological asecurity, where the Self is
simply not concerned with the stability and certainty of its identity, I
do not explore this possibility and how it varies across different
states of physical security in this article.

Having identified different states of physical and ontological security,
I make the further assumption that [since **ontological** and
**physical** security]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}**, [states of security do not vary
**uniformly** across the ontological and physical layers of
security.]{.underline} [One can be at a state of physical insecurity
while being at a state of ontological security, and vice
versa.]{.underline} Consequently, Table 1 charts out the four possible
states of security based on the conception of security as both
ontological and physical.

[The [state of **ontological
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[/[physical
(in)security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} one [where]{.mark} [the
Self experiences concern about]{.mark} **[physical
harm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and uncertainty [of its
**being**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ontological insecurity [**tempts
actors** to]{.mark} engage in practices that [mark Others as]{.mark} not
only **different**]{.underline}, [but also as **[morally
inferior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[threatening]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Campbell 1992).
**[[Ontological]{.mark} insecurity [and physical (in)security reproduce
one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[As actors **seek ontological
security**]{.mark} through **constructing Others as
threats**]{.underline} [to their security-as-survival]{.underline},
[[they **mobilise**]{.mark} **their [physical
defences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[pursuit of physical
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through representing the sources of
threat as **different** and **morally inferior.**]{.underline}

[Similarly, in a state of ontological security/physical (in)security,
actors experience stability and certainty of being in a relationship
where the Other is constructed as threat to their security-as-survival.
[Consequently, they remain locked]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[into]{.underline} **[conflict-producing routines]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[maintain their certainty of
being]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Mitzen 2006a). In protracted conflicts
such as in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine, this state of security sustains
a stable Self/Other relationship based on enemy roles. [When in such a
state of security, minority and majority groups, migrants and host
societies perceive and represent each other's identities as radically
different and inherently incompatible, and reproduce these perceptions
and representations through acts of securitisation]{.underline} [in
order to **ensure their ontological security**.]{.underline} The states
of ontological insecurity/physical (in)security and ontological
security/physical (in)security are both securitised states; however,
whereas the former compels actors to construct new narratives of
difference and threat and engage in the securitisation of new issues to
regain their certainty and stability of being, the latter compels actors
to reproduce the existing narratives and continue the securitisation of
existing differences and conflicts to maintain it.

[[The state of **ontological security**/**physical asecurity**
is]{.mark} certainly **the [most attractive]{.mark} state of
security**]{.underline} [[from a **normative**]{.underline} [point of
view]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[**Security communities** in
**i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations]{.underline}, and in
particular, the European non-war community (Wæver 1998) and the Nordic
community (Browning and Joenniemi 2012) [[constitute the best
examples]{.mark} of such a state of security in international
relations.]{.underline} [[A **collective identity
discourse**]{.underline} [makes it possible]{.underline} ]{.mark}[for
states in security communities [to maintain]{.mark} the [us/them]{.mark}
[distinctions]{.mark}, which are]{.underline}
[**[necessary]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the
**certainty** and **[stability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
being]{.underline}, [while remaining in a state of **physical
asecurity**]{.underline}]{.mark} [vis-à-vis one another]{.underline}
(Mitzen 2006b; Browning and Joenniemi 2012). [[In this state]{.mark} of
security, **[conflicts are sustainably resolved]{.mark}**]{.underline};
[[issues that have propelled conflict in the past are]{.mark} either
**[settled]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[or]{.mark} have **[shed]{.mark}
their [physical security-ness]{.mark},**]{.underline} [and are
negotiated in normal political channels]{.underline}. Yet, identity
differences maintain their ontological security-ness as groups reproduce
their distinct identities through various social and cultural practices.

#### [Hybrid warfare]{.underline} in particular [disrupts]{.underline} NATO's [ontological security]{.underline} -- the AFF [solves]{.underline} by [insulating NATO]{.underline} from [existential fear]{.underline}

[Hybrid warfare indicates a **multitude** of possible
**contingencies**]{.underline}, [generating anxiety about one's ability
to **remain oneself**]{.underline} and to continue to act. [It is thus
linked to "anxiety over the **vulnerability of \[Western\]
power**]{.underline}" (Bell 2012, pp. 230--231), [threatening the West
about losing its particularistic **form of existence**]{.underline} (cf.
Creppell 2011, p. 455). Anxiety, in contrast to fear, which per Giddens
(1991, p. 43) constitutes a response to a specific threat, concerns
"perceived threats to the integrity of the security system of the
individual" (Giddens 1991, pp. 44--45, cf. Browning and Joenniemi 2017,
p. 38; Rumelili 2015). [OS-seeking aims to **mitigate the effects** of
such hard uncertainty, **bringing it within bearable
limits**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 346). **[Routines]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[instrumental]{.underline}** [here, as they
"**pacify the cognitive environment**]{.underline} ... '**[inoculating'
individuals against paralytic, deep fear of chaos]{.underline}**"
(Mitzen 2006, p. 347).

[Being able to **survive** the "hybrid threats" is **directly
pertinent** to the survival of]{.underline} the EU and
**[NATO]{.underline}** [as particular kinds of organisations,
underpinned and **driven by specific values**]{.underline} -- [which
cannot be sacrificed or diluted in the struggle for physical and
institutional survival]{.underline}. [Yet, hybrid warfare disturbs **the
OS**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline} in
subtly distinct ways. Due to the particularities of their institutional
set-ups and historical foundations, the OS drives of the two
organisations are somewhat distinctive. NATO's history is occasionally
told through its surpassing of a sequence of crises, albeit the end of
the Cold War and the collapse of its original enemy created a situation
of unprecedented uncertainty and ontological insecurity for the
Alliance. Meanwhile, the EU's ontological insecurity is a more recent
phenomenon, stemming mostly from the Eurocrisis and the looming
possibility of a Grexit a few years ago; the refugee/migration crisis in
Europe of 2015 (Dingott Alkhoper 2018; Mitzen 2018); the actual UK
decision on Brexit in 2016 (Browning 2018); and the rise of populist
politics within the EU (Kinnvall, Manners, Mitzen 2018) and the United
States. [NATO as a military alliance has been historically more
accustomed to the othering practices of **concrete geographical
places**]{.underline}, whereas the EU is generally regarded as an
organisation that has risen above geopolitical othering, juxtaposing
itself to Europe's dark past instead (Rumelili 2018, Subotic 2018, and
Della Sala 2018). Accordingly, the EU might be more at home with hybrid
threat management due to its historically broader conceptualisation of
security through the paradigm of intertwined risks rather than being
focused more strictly on "the threat, use and control of military force"
in the manner of a traditional defence alliance (Walt 1991, p. 212;
Manners 2002). Regardless of its perpetual transformer's self-image,
[[hybrid threats represent]{.mark} the uncomfortable "hard" or
"[**fundamental**" uncertainty for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Mitzen
2006, p. 346) [[and are]{.mark} thus [**ontologically disturbing** for
the security of **its self** as a **traditional alliance**]{.mark} [with
a **collective security pledge** bound to **"armed
attack"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against one or more of its member
states]{.underline}.

[[In order to achieve OS, actors strive for **"routinizing**
]{.mark}**their [relations with]{.mark} significant
[others"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 342).
**[[Routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [help to **[keep ontological fears
at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [out of **everyday discursive
consciousness**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 348). From this
perspective, NATO's naming and shaming strategy vis-à-vis Russia as part
of its hybrid warfare countering strategy links the uncertainty
emanating from the hybrid nature of the new threats to the known and
routine relationship with its traditional antagonist.8 The
incapacitating [[difficulties related to **planning ahead**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**anticipating** and]{.underline}
[**[countering]{.underline}** [hybrid engagements
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [somewhat
**[alleviated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} latter's [attachment to a **known
rival**]{.underline}. [Russia's hybrid intervention in Ukraine has
concurrently provided NATO with the familiar parameters of the cognitive
"cocoon]{.underline}" (Giddens 1991, pp. 39--40) [which enables the
alliance to **reproduce its cognitively "knowable" world**]{.underline}.
A Mitzenian reading of NATO's emerging response to hybrid
threats/warfare thus points at the renewed routinisation of the
"programmed cognitive and behavioral responses" to Russia as the
alliance's original nemesis.

Restoring traditional vigilance vis-à-vis Russia, buttressing the
forward defence along the Alliance's eastern flank with the respective
military reinforcements, **[[contingency planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and exercises, [the emerging response of NATO to the hybrid menace could
also be read [as a]{.mark}n []{.mark}**attempted [restoration of a known
normative order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the North Atlantic
Alliance]{.underline}. [Hybrid warfare endangers the basic features of
the said normative order]{.underline} (or that of the broadly conceived
Western security community in general, including the EU as well) as its
efficient countering would likely compromise the underlying principles
for this order's particularistic existence (cf. Creppell 2011, p. 450).
As a threat of subversion, [hybrid warfare exposes the internal
vulnerabilities in the body of the traditional security alliance
(NATO)]{.underline} and a self-proclaimed post-modern security actor
(i.e. the EU; cf. Cooper 2004). This concerns, in particular, the
ever-elusive (and contested) balance between national/organisational
security and individual liberties (cf. Waldron 2003, Neocleous 2007), as
strategic communication is inherently at odds with free speech as a core
value of Western liberalism. Countering hybrid warfare is conducive of
generating a security predicament of perpetual pre-emption which, by
definition, would indicate pre-emptive gathering of all sorts of data,
thus likely infringing on the privacy of the individuals for the sake of
the organisational/regional/national security. This precautionary logic
resonates with the risk society approach which characterises the
struggling with a sheer volume of risks with potentially fundamental
consequences as a key feature of modernity, implying that "decisions are
... made not in context of certainty, nor even of available knowledge,
but of doubt, premonition, foreboding, challenge, mistrust, fear, and
anxiety" (Ewald 2002, p. 294).

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **[securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **[causal]{.mark}** account. But
its [**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do]{.mark} the
**[conditions]{.mark}** under which it operates]{.underline}. Why is
speaking security so powerful? [How do mere words twist and transform
the social order? Does the invocation of security prompt a visceral
emotional response? Are speech acts persuasive, by using well-known
tropes to convince audiences that they must seek protection? Or does
securitization operate through the politics of rhetorical coercion,
silencing potential opponents? In securitization accounts, **[speech
acts]{.mark}** often [seem]{.mark} to be [**magical incantations** that
upend normal politics]{.mark} through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **[some]{.mark}**
securitizing moves [resonate]{.mark}, while [others \[are
**ignored**]{.mark}\]]{.underline} fall on deaf ears. [Certainly not all
attempts to construct threats succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of
both traditional military concerns as well as "new" security issues.
[Both neoconservatives and structural realists in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have long insisted that
**conflict with China is inevitable**, yet China has over the last **25
years** been more opportunity than threat in US political
discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent securitizing
moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance has shifted,
and the China threat has started to catch on: **[linguistic processes
alone cannot account]{.mark} for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **[Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it]{.mark}**. You don't have to
subscribe to a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions
important or to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}.
A large part of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's
silence on the politics of security. Its foundations in speech act
theory have yielded an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its
seminal formulation, the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal
linguistic rules that must be followed for a speech act to be recognized
as competent. Yet as Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization
as a purely rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school
[ignores the politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security
to a conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [[Absent]{.mark} from this picture
[are]{.mark} fierce rhetorical battles, [where **coalitions counter
securitizing moves**]{.mark} with their own appeals that strike more or
less deeply at underlying narratives. Absent as well are the [public
intellectuals and media, who]{.mark} **question and [critique]{.mark}**
securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not others), [sometimes
to good effect (and sometimes with little impact)]{.underline}. [[The
**audience**]{.mark} itself---whether the mass public or a narrower
elite stratum---[is **stripped of**]{.mark} **all
[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Speaking security]{.mark}, even when
the performance is competent, **[does not sweep this politics
away]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only by delving into this politics can we
shed light on the mysteries of securitization. We see rhetorical
politics as constituted less by singular "securitizing moves" than by
"contentious conversation"---to use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end,
we would urge securitization theorists, as we recently have elsewhere,
to move towards a "pragmatic" model that rests on four analytical
wagers: that actors are both strategic and social; that legitimation
works by imparting meaning to political action; that legitimation is
laced through with contestation; and that the power of language emerges
through contentious dialogue. We are heartened that our ambivalence
about securitization---the ways in which we find it by turns appealing
and dissatisfying---and our vision for how to move forward have in the
last decade been echoed by (mostly) European colleagues. These critics
have laid out a research agenda that would, if taken up, produce more
satisfying, and more deeply political, theoretical accounts. In our own
work, both individual and collective, we have tried to advance that
research agenda. So long as securitization theorists resist defining the
theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long as it remains wedded to
apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely to gain a broad following
on this side of the pond. [Second, securitization has been held back by
another way in which it is apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to
its Schmittian commitments and political vision. [Successful
securitization, in seminal accounts, replaces normal patterns of
politics with the world of the exception]{.underline}, in which contest
has no place. [They imagine security as the ultimate trump card. But, in
reality, the divide is not nearly so stark. Security **[does not crowd
out]{.mark} all [other spending priorities]{.mark}**---or states would
spend on nothing but defense and "securitized" issues. **[Nor]{.mark}**
does simply declaring something a matter of national security
**[guarantee]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

[A securitizing move is]{.underline}, according to the original
definition by the Copenhagen School, a specific rhetorical structure or
discourse -- or, more precisely, [[a speech act]{.mark} -- that
[frames]{.mark} an issue [as an **existential
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., a security issue (Buzan, Wæver, and
de Wilde 1998: 25--26). The central goal of this chapter is the
identification and analysis of such speech acts because [speech acts
have indeed been the main means by which the Campaign has increasingly
sought [to **securitize AWS**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since other means
have also been employed, we will draw intellectual resources from other
approaches to securitization theory too. There is still more, however,
that we can borrow from the Copenhagen School. Wæver (1995) pointed to
the performative dimension of the move: 'the utterance itself is the act
\[emphasis added\]'. He even defined the process as '\[t\]he performance
of the security act'. Huysmans (2006: 147) accurately spotted the
linguistic practice turning from mere description to performative acts
as one of the organizing principles in social and political relations.
One important caveat is that performativity is not the same thing as a
theatre performance, but is about the ways in which the discourse is
reiterated and networks are created (Ringmar 2019). In this chapter, we
systematically illustrate how a particular communication within a
distributed network produces and reinforces a shared understanding of
insecurity. What deserves special note is that [the emergent security
issue is not necessarily linked to a real existential threat but has to
be constructed and presented as such a threat]{.underline} (Buzan,
Wæver, and de Wilde 1998: 24). There have been insights showing that it
does not stop with a politically and socially constructed threat.
[Discourses of insecurity are often about representations of 'danger'
with material consequences]{.underline} (Campbell 1992). This concept is
important for us too because the kind of threat we examine here has been
constructed through, inter alia, discourses and representations of
danger.

A person or a group that performs the speech act is a securitizing
actor. Success depends to a great extent on the authority position held
by the actor. Only a few actors and groups do in fact have 'the power to
define security'. Among them are political leaders, governments,
bureaucracies, lobbyists, and pressure groups (Buzan, Wæver, and de
Wilde 1998: 31 and 40). Therefore, the Copenhagen School gave us a hint
as to the nature of securitizing actors. Wæver (1995: 57) insisted
specifically, however, that 'security is articulated only from a
specific place, in an institutional voice, \[typically\] by elites'.
Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde (1998: 21) reaffirmed the principle in their
joint book: 'Traditionally, by saying "security," a state representative
\[emphasis added\] declares an emergency condition.' The limitation of
the approach of the Copenhagen School is that it restricts the actors
who can legitimately construct security primarily to political leaders.
Also, the Copenhagen School provided initial instruction on how to
assess the role the audience plays in constructing insecurity, yet this
is another limitation. Success, in their view, depends on the audience
being convinced that the issue is an existential security threat. The
issue is securitized only if and when emergency measures that go beyond
standard political procedures are accepted as justified (Buzan, Wæver,
and de Wilde 1998: 23--25). The audience's role is, therefore, limited
to the mere fact of their accepting the truth of the discourse. Other
approaches to securitization theory will allow us to compensate for
these limits.

Another major contributor to securitization theory has been the Paris
School, situated within the emerging field of international political
sociology and mainly represented by Didier Bigo and Thierry Balzacq.
Their ideas further advanced the understanding of securitizing actors
endowed with the authority to securitize. New actors appeared on the
stage who were professionals with expertise in a given field. The Paris
School put emphasis on expert security knowledge and the 'authority of
statistics' (Bigo 2006). Security professionals and security agencies,
the ones who routinely collect and analyse data, were recognized as
having the authority to determine what exactly constitutes security
(Bigo 2000: 176). Particular attention was drawn to bureaucracies that
serve as an 'intermediary' with the central government and are directly
involved in the provision of security services (e.g., military and
police services, border guards and customs agents, intelligence
services, risk assessment experts, etc.) (Bigo 2006). Increasingly,
security professionals, both researchers and military personnel, are
becoming facilitators for the success of securitization, as we show in
this chapter. Bigo (2002: 83) specifically highlighted that, even if
NGOs intervene, 'they can do so only by turning professional'. Our
analysis here illustrates, among other things, the trend towards
professionalization in NGOs, themselves collecting, distributing, and
efficiently utilizing professional knowledge. The success of the
securitizing move is, consequently, linked to the structural position of
the speaker within a relevant institution (Bigo 2002: 73--74). Bigo
(2006) also noted that such institutions can overstep national
boundaries and form transnational bureaucratic links.
Transnationalization represents, in his view, yet another source of
knowledge and 'symbolic' power. The transnational advocacy Campaign to
Stop Killer Robots, which is the focus of this chapter, is perhaps the
best illustration of how it can play out in everyday practice. Balzacq
(2005: 178--179) listed the very same attributes of authorized security
speakers: knowledge, trust, and the speaker's power position, formal or
symbolic. One of his key points was that 'effective securitization is
power-laden'. In addition, he carved out a more central role for the
audience, focusing on 'the power \[emphasis added\] that both speaker
and listener bring to the interaction' (Balzacq 2005: 171--172). This
insight is still not enough to accurately define the role of the
audience for the purposes of this chapter, but it brings us closer to
the task.

The conceptualization of the securitizing move itself extends beyond the
single speech act, as claimed by the Paris School. Bigo (2002: 65--66)
stressed the importance of bureaucratic practices performed by security
professionals and involved in the creation of administrative knowledge
(e.g., population profiling, risk assessment, statistical calculation,
category creation, proactive preparation, etc.). Therefore, practical
work, discipline, and expertise are certainly no less important than the
discourse (Bigo 2000: 194). Here we concentrate less on bureaucratic
practices and more on different discursive frames in play. However, we
still note, for example, that the Campaign has also drawn quite heavily
upon surveys done by the market research company Ipsos. The most
significant observation that comes out of it, however, is different: the
Paris School broadened the definition of the securitizing move beyond
the single, typically political, speech act. Balzacq (2005: 191) also
focused on the 'manner' in which the securitizing actor makes the case
for the point and drew attention to two basic principles ensuring
ultimate success: 'emotional intensity' and 'logical rigor'. He also
reminded us of the role of analogies, metaphors, stereotypes,
metonymies, lies, gestures, and even silence as effective tools of
persuasion (Balzacq 2005: 172 and 179). In this chapter, we illustrate
the significance of such tools for creating the terrifying image of
'killer robots'. The increasingly blurred lines between fact and
fiction, rationality and emotion are of particular significance to our
understanding of that image. Last, but not least, the Paris School
pointed to the existence of numerous stakeholders with heterogeneous
profiles who do not share the same logics and are often in competition
with each other (Bigo 2006). In such 'power struggles', securitizing
actors align to eliminate alternative voices and swing the audience's
support towards their preferred course of action (Balzacq 2005: 173 and
179). It is a relevant observation, but a careful analysis of such
struggles between the ban Campaign and its opponents is the subject of
the next chapter.

Other, especially more [recent, supplements to securitization theory
contributed to the development of a more sophisticated set of
assumptions regarding the authority of securitizing actors and the
practice of **threat construction**]{.underline}. Stritzel (2012: 553)
summarized the general tendency as the development away from static
understandings of the authority to securitize and single speech acts to
more complex processes of authorization and more dynamic representations
of existential threat. Pointing out such complexities is one of the key
objectives we set for ourselves in this chapter. Vuori (2008: 76)
assumed that even those actors who fall outside official authority, but
have sufficient 'social capital', can become securitizing actors. Social
capital is a special kind of asset available, for example, to NGOs. In
this chapter, we deal directly and specifically with the ways in which
such capital is being mobilized. [Berling]{.underline} (2011: 386)
convincingly [[argued]{.underline}]{.mark}, in addition, [that science
co-determines the status of the securitizing actor]{.underline}. He
called it [[the **'authority of objectivity'**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Berling 2011: 393). Brauch (2009: 94) also drew attention to the
significance of scientific 'reputation'. Unsurprisingly, then, there is
a strong focus on raising a scientific profile within -- and in
association with -- the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. This is
achieved, inter alia, by joining forces with senior scientists and
larger scientific communities. The so-called ['epistemic communities'
can indeed draw on their knowledge [and **expertise**]{.mark} to
[influence the outcome of **securitization moves**]{.mark} 'through
reason and facts on the basis of **(objective) knowledge**']{.underline}
(Floyd 2020: 12). An epistemic community is a network of professionals
from a variety of disciplines with recognized scientific expertise and
competence in a particular domain, according to the original
conceptualization of the term (Haas 1992: 3). Haas (1992: 18)
conceptualized epistemic communities as a separate category, inherently
distinct from interest groups, social movements, and bureaucratic
coalitions. Even though he equipped us with the appropriate concept, the
definition is problematic. It is increasingly difficult to draw
definitive dividing lines between scientists, political activists, and
activist bureaucrats, as we clearly show here. [A closer look reveals
two serious problems: scientific facts are selectively used, twisted, or
suppressed by political activists to serve their political purpose; and
scientists themselves become willingly and directly involved in policy
making and political manipulation]{.underline}. Berling (2011: 392)
[assumed that 'scientific capital' co-determines 'the
hierarchy]{.underline} \[emphasis added\] [in the field of security and
the chances of winning'. **[Yet the opposite is the case]{.mark}** in
this chapter. [**Hierarchies** are being **replaced** with **more
horizontal heterarchies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we will demonstrate.
Science contributes significantly to the chances of success [[and
**successful claims for legitimacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
scientists [[do **not**]{.mark} necessarily [**play a central role**
in]{.mark} the process of **[securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There has, at the same time, been greater awareness that the audience
can reinforce the authority of the securitizing actor. Salter (2008:
321--322) conceptualized interactions between the securitizing actor and
the audience as 'iterative'. He studied the process of 'audience-speaker
co-constitution \[emphasis added\] of authority and knowledge'. McInnes
and Rushton (2011: 117) even introduced the idea that original audiences
can, at some points themselves, act as securitizing actors. These
insights help us conceptualize and, more importantly, analyse [a much
more active engagement on the part of the audience and the increasingly
blurred line between securitizing actors and their target
audiences]{.underline}. [We call]{.underline} it
**[hybridization]{.underline}**, as explained below, and show how it
works in practice. We also clearly demonstrate that such hybridization
has no clear boundaries. Floyd (2020) drew our attention to the role of
'functional actors', often confused with the audience but, in fact,
seeking to positively or negatively influence the trajectory of
securitization. The concept itself, though originally underdeveloped, is
borrowed from the Copenhagen School. Floyd (2020: 10) stressed that
media outlets can prioritize certain issues over others, decide how
information is relayed, and, therefore, control what becomes public
knowledge. Vultee (2011: 77--93) showed practically how the media 'speak
security'. Our intention through this text is to once again demonstrate
that the media play a crucial role in shaping public threat perception
and disseminating stereotypes. [The very idea of 'killer robots' caught
public attention and imagination through broad media coverage. Foreign
politicians can, in turn, either provide or withhold external
legitimation]{.underline}, according to Floyd (2020: 10). [[The **most
important consequence**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as we show, [[is **peer
pressure**]{.mark}, i.e., attempts by the truly pro-ban [states]{.mark}
to **[push the blocking coalition towards adopting the ban on
AWS]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Members employed in the relevant industry
can equally facilitate or impede securitization by presenting reasoned
arguments for one side or the other (Floyd 2020: 11). We have a perfect
illustration here: many technology companies have supported the Campaign
to Stop Killer Robots and publicly committed not to engage in the
development of AWS. Clearly, such statements have significantly
strengthened the spirit of the Campaign. Floyd's (2020: 12)
interpretation also suggests that even ordinary people can affect the
dynamics of securitization, for example, through social media activism.
Here we illustrate how ordinary people can facilitate securitization by
partaking in surveys and voicing their concerns about the perceived
threat. We also highlight that the Campaign has closely aligned with a
broad wave of public concern, which has further reinforced its
legitimacy in the eyes of the general public.

Numerous studies have also sought to develop a more nuanced
understanding of the core of securitizing moves. First of all, there has
been a general awareness that scientific models, data, and facts 'can be
mobilized strategically' (Berling 2011: 393). Stritzel (2012: 560)
explored the link between power politics and popular culture as 'a
principal background of meaning'. In particular, he inquired into the
use of pop culture and cultural myths by securitizing actors. Williams
(2003: 526--527) suggested that images and other visual representations
are also part of 'a broader performative act' and do play a significant
role in the process of securitization. This chapter shows how scientific
facts and cultural imaginaries, visual and discursive frames are all
mobilized simultaneously to construct the threat of so-called killer
robots. Some scholars have even sought to highlight the supposed links
between different security agendas such as the 'migration-terrorism
nexus' (Ihlamur-Öner 2019), the 'terrorism-asylum nexus', or even the
'terrorism-immigration-asylum nexus' (Tsoukala 2006: 612 and 618). This
is an important, yet undeveloped, argument. It is a good starting point
for us to properly conceptualize processes of grafting involved in a
securitizing move, as further elaborated below. [Salter]{.underline}
(2012: 934), at the same time, [reminds us of the fact that
'[**securitization** is a **constant process** of]{.mark} struggle and
**[contestation]{.mark}**']{.underline}. In accord with his
interpretation, [the so-called securitizing move in fact [consists of
'**overlapping**]{.mark} ... **[language security games]{.mark}**
performed [by **varying**]{.mark} **relevant
[actors]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Salter 2012: 931). The same author
noted elsewhere (2008: 321) that there are also distinct types of
audiences and that the move may be successful with some of them, but not
others. It is a reminder for us: systematic hybridization between
different types of actors acting at different stages in the
securitization process, as we illustrate, does not necessarily lead to
greater homogenization. We show it here too.

Building on this rich and diverse body of knowledge, the insights we
borrow primarily include the significance of scientific reputation, the
varied and dynamic identities of securitizing actors, the increasingly
blurred line between securitizing actors and their target audiences, and
the diversity of ways in which the threat can be constructed and
presented. Yet we also go beyond to inquire into the process of
over-securitization. There have already been efforts to understand and
theorize over-securitization, so the term itself is not new. However,
the existing literature approaches the problem from the perspective of
referent objects of security. Hammerstad (2008: 1--2) was the first to
point out that a security issue can 'become over-securitised to the
point where it is in danger of creating threats \[to the referent
object\] where before there were none'. Ihlamur-Öner (2019: 210)
concurred: 'The securitization of irregular and forced migration has
reached to the point that it can be described as over-securitization,
which creates more threats where there were none, while putting the
lives of migrants and refugee protection at risk.'

We take a different approach still and explore the dynamics of
over-securitization from the perspective of securitizing actors and
securitizing moves. In doing so, we distinguish two mechanisms through
which over-securitization operates at these two levels: hybridization
and grafting, respectively. Through the former, [we demonstrate how
complex [**hybridization** of **securitizing actors** and **target
audiences** produces]{.mark} circulatory, [**transepistemic**, and
**post-truth** configurations]{.mark} of **security**]{.underline}. When
making this argument, we are inspired by Aradau and Huysmans. They
accurately determined that ['**transepistemic relations** [create
**greater symmetry between various knowledges** and **dilute the
superior authority** of]{.mark} science in truth telling and **[factual
knowledge]{.mark}** about the world']{.underline} (Aradau and Huysmans
2018: 49). The same authors (2018: 54) defined the condition of
post-truth as 'a less hierarchical and more horizontal transversal
practice of knowledge creation and circulation'. We have a practical
illustration of their statements and argue that, when the tipping point
is reached, [the diffusion of authority [**decreases** the
**likelihood** of **successful securitization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The concept of '**[grafting]{.mark}** \[a new norm onto existing
norms\]' stands for a well-established legal practice and]{.underline}
is borrowed from Price (1998: 617). Here it [helps us conceptualize how
a new security agenda can be grafted, through]{.underline} both
**[[discursive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and visual [[**representations**,
onto]{.mark} other security issues of immediate importance and even
**[sci]{.mark}**ence **[fi]{.mark}**ction imagery]{.underline}. [Such
grafting techniques]{.underline}, as we show, [reinforce the sense of
insecurity but, quite **[counter-intuitively]{.mark}**, can in some
cases **[impede instead of facilitate]{.mark}** the
**[securitization]{.mark}** process]{.underline}. The imprecise focus
and reductionist paths make it more difficult to name the threat
clearly, which is a precondition for successful securitization. Salter
(2012: 938--940) gave an example of what it means if 'the threat remains
vague \[emphasis added\]'.

[Here lies the paradox: [**success in broadening the stakeholder base**
and **generating the sense of insecurity** does **not**]{.mark}
necessarily [mean the **success of
securitization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a nutshell, greater efficiency
does not necessarily translate into greater effectiveness. Hence,
over-securitization is about securitization efforts that are too intense
and too ubiquitous, to the point of becoming counter-productive.

STABILITY AND CHANGE Arms Control: Conservative or Transformative? As
the \"impact" discussion indicated, [Arms Control can be looked at from
two opposite perspectives concerning stability and change. Arms control
aims at stability; **critical security approaches** have thus labeled
arms control as a **conservative, status-quo orientated
strategy**]{.underline} (**[Krause & [Cooper]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
2011; Krause & Latham, 1998). [This school has also ascribed certain
attributes of the concept to Western culture, thereby **[reifying the
West]{.mark}** as completely American **[without accounting for]{.mark}
the [considerable differences within]{.mark}** the West (which shows,
for example, in the related EU strategies]{.underline} \[EU, 2003a,
2003b, 2016\]). [In this spirit, critical scholars have [labeled as
Western]{.mark} such attributes as the "**necessity of
[deterrence]{.mark}**,\" a "preference for one\'s own
**[preponderance]{.mark}**,\" and a "focus on proliferation" **[as if
the Soviet Union had not shown the same traits]{.mark}** all throughout
the Cold War, [and]{.mark} as if **[Russia]{.mark}** had not
**[followed]{.mark}** the Soviet predecessor in this respect as
well]{.underline}. [**[But]{.mark}** there is [also]{.mark} a
transformational perspective]{.underline}: [Arms Control [as a
**vehicle** for]{.mark} inducing]{.underline}, accompanying, and
reinforcing [a fundamental **[redefinition of the relationship
between]{.mark}**]{.underline} two or more
**[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the template for this approach is, as
will be discussed later, the years from 1985 to 1992, when the Cold War
dissolved. Naturally, the concept of disarmament shows the greatest
affinity to the transformational approaches. [This transformational
perspective **[leaves]{.mark} the [dogmatic]{.mark} connection between
arms control and [stability behind]{.mark}**. **[Stability by arms
control is]{.mark} itself [an instrument to foster dynamic
change]{.mark}**, just as homeostasis in young organisms is the
condition for dynamic growth]{.underline}. [This perspective opens the
broader view on the relation of Arms Control and historical time. A
reading of the history of arms control results in three models to
conceive this relationship]{.underline}. Arms Control Through Time:
Three Models. The first model corresponds to the enlightenment intuition
of steady progress: [Arms Control, once started, will **[create islands
of coop]{.mark}**eration in a still formidable sea of
self-help]{.underline}. But successful agreements [have an impact beyond
technical constraints or limited cooperation gains. The factor of
"**[learning]{.mark}**," enabled by agreements and their institutional
settings, **[changes the relationship]{.mark} between** former rivals
and **antagonists [incrementally, but]{.mark}**]{.underline} potentially
**[[profoundly]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Nye, 1989). New information
mitigates the security dilemma, as both capabilities and intentions of
the partner become better understood and more predictable. [Admitting
transparency]{.underline} on agreed level of forces, which reduce
opportunities and incentives to attack first---whether conventional or
nuclear---build down the image of the enemy as a nefarious and
implacable antagonist poised to devour neighbors and enemies. Arms
Control works as a conduit for reassurance; the reassured party imputes
more benevolent intentions on. its opposite. Institutional
settings---domestic, bilateral, and multilateral---create new
bureaucratic routines, produce more information, help to solve problems
of ambiguity and suspicions of non-compliance, and inculcate cooperative
practices in the daily work of decision makers and bureaucrats.
[Moreover, successful Arms Control agreements **set incentives to try
more daring ones**. **[In the process, states]{.mark}** might
**[redefine their]{.mark} own [security
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, Arms Control is not able to
drive this process alone. Rather, [its political effects help to
encourage steps in other areas of the conflicting relationship, arid
such steps (and their domestic repercussions) stimulate in turn new
efforts in Arms Control. Throughout this development, [increasing
**transnational communities**]{.mark} ([**epistemic** and
otherwise]{.mark}) connect the national discourses of the participating
countries by importing common knowledge, serving as interpreters of the
\'\'other's" views and actions, and working as advocates of
cooperation]{.underline} (Nye, 1987, 1989) The Gorbachev years of 1985
to 1991 provide an impressive example for this dynamic. In the best
case, it might [**[turn islands of coop]{.mark}**eration **[into a
continent]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Evangelista, 1999; Risse, 2000). The
second model is a significant modification of the first one. It
preserves the long-term vision of a cooperative world, but (informed by
[the historical experiences of [the **last 60
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}) [understands the Arms Control process as
[a series of **waves**]{.mark}, each of which leaves the world in a more
cooperative state than the previous one: a pure self-help system gives
way to an arms-control driving detente constellation, followed by a new
political ice age in which, however, some of the Arms Control
achievements of the detente period survive]{.underline}. [A second Arms
Control wave, followed by another ice age ensues, with again a few new
lasting gains for cooperative security, and so on]{.underline}. This
model [accounts for the multifactorial political environment in which
Arms Control has to operate. Power shifts among nations,]{.underline}
national revolutions, [or domestic polarization, can replace elites well
socialized into the concepts and practices of Arms Control with
nationalist, unilateralist, and supremacist elites, who see the only way
to security and status in absolute superiority or even aggression and
conquest]{.underline}. This account of **[the [process toward more
coop]{.mark}eration [through ups and downs]{.mark} reflects better the
experiences since 1960]{.underline}**. A tentative success after the
Cuban missile crisis, the Partial Test Ban Treaty, was followed by five
years of stagnation, caused by the toppling of Khrushchev in Moscow,
alienation through the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia. The conclusion of the negotiations on the NPT toward the
end of 1968 opened the first wave of Arms Control in the period of
detente. After the--- supposedly hawkish---presidency of Richard Nixon
had installed itself, strategic arms negotiations started quickly. The
next decade saw four agreements of strategic nuclear arms, two on
testing, two multilateral treaties to prohibit biological and
environmental weapons, and a couple of confidence-building measures to
avoid severe crises between the superpowers, plus those in the context
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, the
"Helsinki Document"). However, this period came to a halt at the end of
the decade when conservative concerns about perceived growing Soviet
nuclear superiority and cheating, and Soviet inroads in the developing
world produced a climate no longer conducive to Arms Control---SALT II
remained observed by the two parties, but unratified. The early Reagan
years were confrontational, with unfettered armament, and token Arms
Control talks in order to pacify a concerned Western public on both
sides of the Atlantic. Gorbachev's ascendancy to power changed the
situation (Arnett, 1990; Evangelista, 1999). Starting with new CSCE
confidence-building measures in 1986 (the "Stockholm Document'\' later
dramatically enhanced by the series of "Vienna Documents"), a cascade of
bilateral (INF Treaty, START I, START II), multilateral regional (CFE
Treaty and the unprecedented Open Sky Treaty, which grants the parties
mutual information-gathering overflight rights), and multilateral global
(Chemical Weapons Convention, Ottawa Convention on anti-personal land
mines, and the indefinite extension of the NPT) measures followed in
close sequence. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was the last
hurrah, but failed to attract the necessary "advice and consent" in the
U.S. Senate, which was already dominated by archconservative forces led
by Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relation Committee. From 1997 on, the political climate cooled down.
Arms Control froze with the George W. Bush administration. The Moscow
Treaty on strategic nuclear arms---a treaty without specifications, with
a termination date of 2012 and no verification---was the only
achievement, neutralized through the far more weighty abrogation of the
ABM-Treaty by the Bush administration, which led to the prompt
abrogation of START II by Russia, followed by Moscow\'s withdrawal from
the CFE Treaty; the multilateral Oslo Convention banning cluster
munitions succeeded only because the United States, opposed to this
agreement, did not possess a veto position. Obama\'s revival of Arms
Control yielded the New START Treaty, the agreement for the reduction of
weapons-grade plutonium with Russia, and the Arms Trade Treaty, in. an
all too brief period of new detente that ended at the latest with the
Russian annexation of the Crimea in 2014. [The notion of **waves** has
[**a lot of empirical evidence** to **support**]{.mark} it]{.underline}.
One interesting indicator is the titles of writings on the subject that
have appeared over time. A Farewell to Arms Control? (Young, 1972),
\"Arms Control: The Possibility of a Second Coming" (Freedman,1982),
"Farewell to Arms Control?" again (Nye, 1986), "The Death of Arms
Control" (Sullivan, 1987), The Future of Arms Control (Ball & Mack,
1987), "The Folly of Arms Control" (Schell, 2000),7 "The Rise and Fall
of Arms Control" (Bohlen, 2005), all indicate a shifting between the
highs and lows of the theme. It also indicates that [experts did not
always agree on whether they were feeing a high or a low]{.underline}.
Young\'s book was written during the years of the first big Arms Control
wave. Freedman's \"second coming\" was authored in the first years of
the Reagan Administration's dark years for Arms Control. Nye s
"Farewell" and Sullivan\'s "Death," written from quite different
positions, appeared when Gorbachev moved Arms Control on its path of
greatest success, as acknowledged by the more optimistic Nye. Curiously,
"The Death of Deterrence" (Dando & Rogers, 1984) falls between the
"second coming\" and the \"death" of Arms Control. [That these **waves**
lead toward **ever-increased security coop**eration in a **spiral-shaped
process**, however, is not self-evident. Consequently, the third model
drafts a circular process]{.underline}. [Progress is only temporary and
will be overtaken by the eternal, harsh forces of the international
power struggle]{.underline}. [Of course, this is the view of the more
pessimistic version of realism]{.underline}: Arms Control ebbs and
floods alternate, but Arms Control achievements are fully or almost
fully lost in each ice age: ["progress" does not hold]{.underline}.
Security cooperation and its legal and institutional sediments are a
marginal phenomenon, dependent on temporary interest constellations.
When interests shift, or when a power shift changes the hierarchy of the
international system, the achievements of the past period will erode or
explode, and the system returns to the dangerous competition, including
its military aspects, which is its natural state (Mearsheimer, 1995; see
also Mearsheimer, 2001 for the theoretical background). [Among the three
models, **the "spiral model\" has most to show
empirically**]{.underline}. As Joseph Nye (1987, 1989) observed already
in 1987, [even the icy early 1980s left much of the Arms Control
achievements intact, such as the NPT, naval confidence-building
measures, and the CSCE process with its confidence-building (the
European allies prevailed over U.S. preferences)]{.underline}. [During
the George W. Bush years, NPT, CWC, and BWC continued]{.underline} (the
latter one after heroic rescue activities by the Europeans), [the mutual
reductions pursuant to the Moscow Treaty took place, the INF Treaty
remained in force, as did CSCE confidence building, and even the Open
Sky Treaty]{.underline}. The same applies to all global multilateral
treaties. A second observation: Phil Farley counted, in his contribution
to probably the best book on Arms Control that has ever been written,
[eight negotiations]{.underline} that had [failed before
1987]{.underline} (Farley, 1988, pp. 620,627-629). [During the 28 years
that have since passed, six of these eight have been successfully
concluded]{.underline}.8 Up to now, [the \"spiral model\" appears to
hold, **[despite]{.mark} setbacks in the early 1980s**, the years of the
George W. **Bush** Administration, **or [the present impasse]{.mark}**;
thus, [the **hopeful**]{.mark} Kantian [**vision** of **ever-closer
security coop**]{.mark}eration [is **still on the
table**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Permissive Effect of Prohibition Norms. [One of the criticisms of
critical security studies scholars has been that the **[prohibition of
some weapons]{.mark}** has had the effect of **[legitimizing
non-prohibited weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} (**[Cooper]{.underline}**,
2011; **[Mathur]{.underline}**, 2011). [Indeed]{.underline}, there is
the ''permissive'' effect, which results from the [stigmatization of the
prohibited weapons as inhuman]{.underline}, which [implies in turn that
weapons not banned simultaneously are not equally inhumane]{.underline}.
[For material and psychological reasons, the focus on banning a specific
weapon system will very probable prevent efforts to ban other weapons
with comparable effects at the same time: The campaign to get rid
of]{.underline} incendiary weapons ([napalm]{.underline}) [in the 1980s
postponed action on landmines and cluster munitions for one and two
decades, respectively]{.underline}. [The material factor is the resource
restraint (financial, time, diplomatic capital) of ban
proponents]{.underline} (NGOs and like-minded governments), [which makes
it difficult to tackle more than one item at a time]{.underline}. [The
psychological effect is the impossibility of focusing and maintaining
attention of both activists and the public (media and people) on more
than one issue in a certain time-span]{.underline} (Rosert, 2015, 2016).
[[As the sequence from **incendiary**]{.mark} weapons (prohibited in
1983), [to]{.mark} anti-personal **[mines]{.mark}** (prohibited in
1997), [to **cluster munitions**]{.mark} (prohibited in 2009)
[demonstrates, however, this permissive]{.mark}/preventive [effect
is]{.mark} determining **[only temporari]{.mark}ly**]{.underline}. [In
the [**long-term**, the **opposite**]{.mark} effect can be
[observed]{.mark}, "**[issue cascading]{.mark}**": the successful
subjection on one type of weapon under the anti-humanitarian **stigma
makes it easier** for a follow-up campaign to **frame** the **next
candidate for a ban** in a way that **promises success**]{.underline}.
[The **[framing]{.mark}** of [a weapon]{.mark} type [in
**analogy**]{.mark} or comparison with an already stigmatized one
(grafting) **[becomes easier]{.mark}** as more weapons fall under a ban,
and more characteristics and attributes are available to draw parallels
to a weapon that is still permitted]{.underline} (Price, 1998, pp.
627-631). If permissive or preventive effects mean that old Arms Control
stands in the way of new Arms Control, [the cascading effect shows that
old Arms Control can engender new Arms Control]{.underline}. Real World
Effects. So far, the discussion has dealt with the effects of Arms
Control on state behavior. [Changed state behavior, of course, has
effects on the physical world: [Due to]{.mark} the implementation of
[Arms Control]{.mark} agreements, [there are fewer **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (between 15,000 and 16,000 instead of
more than 60,000, at the height of the Cold War), [fewer
**[c]{.mark}**hemical weapons, fewer **[b]{.mark}**iological
**[w]{.mark}**eapons, and fewer states possessing nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons in the world, [and]{.mark} fewer [conventional weapon
s]{.mark}ystems]{.underline} in Europe [than would have been the case
otherwise]{.underline}. The most impressive numbers come from
humanitarian Arms Control groups: According to the Red Cross, [[the
number of **victims of landmines**]{.mark} was at **[20,000]{.mark}**
the year before the Ottawa Convention. It has gone [**down to 3,500**
per year]{.mark} since]{.underline}. By the end of 2015, [international
production and **[transfer]{.mark}** of these weapons had commensurately
**[shrunk, including by]{.mark}** some **[non-members]{.mark}**
producers, quite **[a]{.mark} remarkable external [effect of the
norm]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[even **48 non-state**]{.mark} **armed
[groups]{.mark}** have [renounced]{.mark} the use of mines]{.underline}
on the initiative of the NGO Geneva CalL Twenty-nine states were
declared to be mine-free through efforts under the Ottawa Convention
(International Committee of the Red Cross, 2016). By the end of 2014,
3.68 million anti-personal mines had been destroyed in operations
pursuant to the Convention (Landmines Report, 2009, p. 1; Landmines
Report, 2015, p. 2). [Surprisingly, in light of **[so many lives
saved]{.mark}**, **some [scholars]{.mark}** belonging to the Critical
Security Studies school **[contend]{.mark} that [humanitarian]{.mark}
Arms [Control constitutes]{.mark} a well-concealed submission of civil
society to the imperatives of [Western militarism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Beier, 2011; **[Cooper]{.underline}**, 2011; **[Mathur]{.underline}**,
2011, 2012, 2014). [This assessment of the mine campaign as
\"reconstitution of the West (and Western interest)" having "played a
crucial (even decisive) role in the construction of the \'landmine
crisis']{.underline}" (**[Krause]{.underline}** & Latham, 1998, p. 44)
[remains **mysterious**: First, **both** the Ottawa and the Oslo
conventions were **opposed by** the quintessential Western power, **the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [Second, both were
**enthusiastically supported** by the main **victims** of the prohibited
weapons, namely the countries from Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast
Asia]{.underline} (Price, 1998, pp. 640-641). [One could suspect that,
**[based on ideological doctrine]{.mark}**, some [scholars are
**critical of all but their own**]{.mark} perceptual
**[biases]{.mark}**, a strong [similar]{.mark}ity [to]{.mark} some of
[the]{.mark} realist and [**neo-conservative critics** of]{.mark} arms
[control]{.mark}, which [they]{.mark} so enthusiastically
[condemn]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back to the independent-dependent
variable relationship: The structurationist school of constructivism,
orientated to the work of Anthony Giddens, takes [the **middle
ground**]{.underline} by [constructing a dialectical relationship by
which processes of Arms Control and processes of broader
policy]{.underline} would [mutually influence each other]{.underline}.
As Arms Control has been conceptualized as a way to mitigate the
security dilemma, its likely effects should be tangible there. [Measures
that reduce the ambiguity of intention and capabilities, and measures
that, notably, **reduce the capability for large-scale, speedy
offensives** should have **strong positive impacts on mutual
perception** and help to **foster security cooperation on a broad
scope**]{.underline} (Peters, 1992). They give **[signals]{.underline}**
of [the **absence of aggressive intentions** and thereby help
**overcome** the fundamental **uncertainty**, which is at the heart of
the **security dilemma**]{.underline} (Lamb, 1988, pp. 225-234). The
\"Gorbachev effect" on the West was exactly that. ACADEMIC AND POLITICAL
DISCOURSES [Academic and political discourses on arms
control]{.underline}, disarmament, [and non-proliferation in
general]{.underline}, as well as in specific political fields of action,
[are framed in four different perspectives: deterrence, defense,
disarmament, and humanitarian discourses]{.underline}.2 The deterrence
approach is dominated by nuclear weapons: The regulation of arms is seen
as maintaining a stable deterrence relationship, understood as the
mutually assured capability to strike back after a first strike,
accompanied by measures that make a first strike as unlikely,
unprovoked, and unattractive as possible. Consequently, nuclear weapons,
seen as embodying the greatest deterrence value, enjoy a legitimate
existence (e.g., Quinlan, 2009; Riihle, 2009; Tertrais, 2011), though
the idea of conventional deterrence has also been pursued (Gerson, 2009;
Mearsheimer, 1985). Where the deterrence discourse prevails, certain
Arms Control measures fall in disregard. For example, de-alerting
(putting strategic nuclear forces on low alert) or even de-mating the
nuclear warheads from delivery vehicles, could be seen as destabilizing
deterrence against a first strike. Shifting to a no first-use doctrine
could be interpreted as opening one\'s nuclear forces for a first strike
conducted by non-nuclear means. Arms control in a deterrence discourse
could even advocate, under •certain circumstances, a build-up of nuclear
forces if numbers have diminished below a perceived minimum that is seen
as vulnerable to the combined offensive capabilities of potential
enemies. The Chinese aversion against transparency is also
stability-motivated, lest transparency could facilitate first-strike
targeting against Bejing s comparably small arsenal. Arms control is a
servant of deterrence and is limited by the perceived requirements of
the latter. The defense discourse means the capability to react once
deterrence fails and a ruthless enemy pursues conquest or extermination.
Arms control, in this discourse, must recognize the need and serve the
maintenance of a robust defense posture, which nowadays must inevitably
include defense against missiles. At the conventional level, the CFE
(Conventional Armed Forces in Europe) Treaty came closest to the ideal
arms control agreement: By reducing, and establishing an exact balance
for, those five weapon systems needed for a large-scale,
territory-grabbing land attack, while not touching those weapons
indispensable for defense (like air defense or anti-tank systems), it
granted the two participating alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Treaty
Organization, a chance for successful conventional defense This formula,
however, is hardly applicable to the nuclear sector: deterrence can only
be upheld through the offensive capability to strike even after having
suffered an attack. Effective defenses could annihilate this capability
for the party forced to strike second. It is hardly possible, therefore,
to achieve conventional defense and nuclear deterrence on the basis of
the same discourse, but only by combining the two. The defense discourse
on Arms Control is structured in a way that Arms Control advocates must
always fight an uphill battle against the argument of military
utility/necessity. This burden of justification has hampered and
frustrated advocates of international humanitarian law in the context of
the Geneva Protocols and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW) time and again (Mathur, 2012; see below). [The **[disarmament
discourse]{.mark}** has a **moral overtone** in that weapons are seen as
immoral and dangerous items that, whatever their military value, must be
dismantled. They [are **framed in**]{.mark} **discourses of
[stigmatization]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Shamai, 2015), [in which the
stigma is connected to their destructive power (WMD [as **threat to
\[human\]**]{.mark}]{.underline}man[**[kind]{.mark}**), cruelty that
causes unnecessary and lasting suffering (chemical weapons, incendiary
weapons), [and **indiscriminate**]{.mark} **effects on civilians**
(**[all WMD]{.mark}**, antipersonal **[mines]{.mark}**, cluster
munitions)]{.underline} (Borrie, 2009; Price, 1998,2007; Rosert,
2015,2016). [**[Stigma]{.mark}** is not confined to WMD, but [can be
**glued to other weapons**]{.mark} systems **[as well]{.mark}**; hence,
weapons singled out for disarmament discourses are not dependent on the
particular strategic value; to the contrary, part of the discourse
consists of contesting this value to disempower arguments of military
utility]{.underline}, which are usually deployed by opponents of the
prohibition. Proponents of disarmament are even busy denying the utility
of nuclear weapons for both warfare and deterrence (Harrington, 2009;
Wilson, 2007, 2008). [**Today, [disarmers rely]{.mark} strongly [on
humanitarian arguments]{.mark}**; the **disarmament and humanitarian
[discourses tend to amalgamate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
**humanitarian discourse**]{.underline}; finally, [asks for measures
that serve best the goal of **human security**: the **survival**,
well-being, and integrity of **individuals**]{.underline}, notably
civilians; consequently, the weapons that have the most devastating
effect and discriminate least between combatants and civilians are
subject to the demand for elimination, notwithstanding their ascribed
military value. It is noteworthy that today\'s humanitarian discourse,
manifested in a broad array of weapon types from antipersonal mines to
nuclear weapons, has evolved from the tradition of the legal discourse
on the humanitarian law of war that prevailed into the 1990s. There, the
basic formula was to weigh humanitarian concerns and military utility.
The humanitarian discourse was thus dominated by the defense and
deterrence discourses. [**[Today's]{.mark} humanitarian [Arms Control
discourse]{.mark}** gives priority to human concerns over military
utility and **[links humanitarianism with disarmament, not with
constraints on weapons use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given the weight of
military considerations in the attitudes and decision making of
nation-states, this does not eliminate completely the weighting of
military aspects. But, the burden of proof has shifted. In the old
humanitarian law discourse, humanitarians had to argue against
\"military utility.\" In the new discourse, opponents of prohibition
have to argue for indispensability and irreplaceability of the weapons
in question (Price, 1998, p. 632). [As a consequence, in the nuclear
weapons field, a majority of states is **[not satisfied]{.mark} anymore
[with small steps]{.mark} of arms reduction, transparency
measures**]{.underline}, and confidence building; [**[rather, they push
for]{.mark}** a fast **[elimination]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons,
preceded by the conclusion of a nuclear weapons ban]{.underline}
(Borrie, 2014; Kmentt, 2015). [**The reason for the conservatism of the
classical discourse** on humanitarian law is **not** so much the past
practices of the **legalistic discourse** of international humanitarian
law]{.underline} (Mathur, 2012) [as the result of the balance of
political power, with great powers prevailing that wanted their
utilitarian concerns]{.underline} (fighting and winning wars) [to weigh
heavily in the resulting treaties]{.underline}. [The new discourse, in
contrast, was created by a coalition of humanitarian and disarmament
NGOs, and smaller and middle powers that push their causes because they
have more moral concerns than stakes in fighting and winning wars, or in
the weapons needed for war or for deterrence]{.underline} (Borrie,
2014). The intrinsic nature of the discourses has not engendered the
change, but shifts in coalitions and discursive power (Mathur, 2012).

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORIES AND ARMS CONTROL [**Arms Control does
not completely discard self-help** as the basis of national security,
**but entrusts a** more or less **significant piece of it to cooperation
with potential enemies**]{.underline}.3 [**For this reason, Arms Control
is a difficult subject for** (purist) **realism**]{.underline} and
neorealism, [but also for **post-modernism**]{.underline}.
[Realism]{.underline} and neo-realism [expect states to pursue self-help
as the only reliable basis for their national security]{.underline}.
Cooperative security efforts admit that at least part of one\'s own
security is dependent on the partners\' compliance with agreed rules.
Arms Control also requires a more relaxed attitude toward the problem of
relative gains, the somehow unequal distribution of gains emerging from
cooperation (Grieco, 1990). Since it is extremely difficult to (define
exact balances (numerical balances, for example, neglect differences in
geopolitical situations, qualitative aspects, or intangibles like
differences in training, etc), relative gains are not only certain to
occur, but difficult to assess exactly. Even the notion of an exchange
of renunciation, in exchange for a security guarantee, is implausible in
the face of the security dilemma, as the guarantor might defeat or may
mutate into the enemy of tomorrow. **[That Arms Control happens in
reality is thus somehow puzzling]{.underline}**. **[For post-modernists,
Arms Control is only thinkable as a hegemonic project to maintain power
differentials, not as a non-hegemonic common endeavor that serves all
participants well]{.underline}**. [Both realists and post-modernists are
only at ease with unilateral, hegemonic Arms Control imposed on others,
notably on defeated states after war]{.underline} (for example, Iraq in
1991). [[For]{.mark} post-modernists, **[post-colonialists]{.mark}**,
and **critical security scholars**, **[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration
**[is]{.mark} the paradigm of hegemonic Arms Control as [an attempt to
prevent others from obtaining the weapons]{.mark} that [oneself
possesses]{.mark}**, and the conceding of the difference by middle
powers like Canada or Sweden is only explainable by the discursive
hegemony of the nuclear weapon states]{.underline} (Keeley, 1990).
[These critics are right to **[see roots]{.mark}** of non-proliferation
thinking [in]{.mark} the **[racist ideology]{.mark} of the colonial
era**]{.underline}, parts of which have been transported into the 20th
century and resonate still in the \"rogue state" discourse, with the
thrust that "civilized" states must keep "barbarians" at bay by
maintaining the difference in military power (Barkawi & Laffey, 2006;
**[Gusterson]{.underline}**, 1999; **[Mathur]{.underline}**, 2014).
[[This **critique**]{.mark}, however, [has **several
weaknesses**]{.mark}. It [**ignores** that **non-prolif**]{.mark}eration
**[was deployed]{.mark} first [with]{.mark} Germany and Japan**, then
already members of "**[the West]{.mark}**," [as the **primary
targets**]{.mark}]{.underline},4 [that the first victims of U.S. export
controls in the 1970s were advanced European states and Japan, **and**
that **controversies over the** peaceful uses of nuclear energy for the
first two decades of the]{.underline} nuclear NonProliferation Treaty
(**[NPT]{.underline}**) **[were between Western governments more than
between the West and the non-aligned]{.underline}** (Bccker et al.,
2013); [moreover, the]{.underline} Nuclear Suppliers Group
(**[NSG]{.underline}**) [as a main organ of Western nuclear export
controls includes today Brazil, China, Mexico, Kazakhstan, and South
Africa, **non-Westem members that are more than fig
leafs**]{.underline}. **[[It is the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[that]{.mark} is pushing the
membership of India and has **[terminated "nuclear apartheid\"]{.mark}**
as far as India is concerned]{.underline}. Conversely, most European
states have not joined the "rogue state\" discourse, [and many
**[Western]{.mark}** Arms Control and **[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration
[**experts** have **never accepted the distinction between "reasonable\"
Northern**]{.mark} **nuclear weapon [states and "irrational"
Southerners]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[To the contrary]{.mark}**, they
have **[warned against]{.mark}** the [risks]{.mark} in South Asia
**[because of the proven risks of the]{.mark} nuclear arms race during
the [Cold War, where only a lot of luck saved
\[human\]]{.mark}**]{.underline}man**[[kind]{.mark} from a global
nuclear holocaust]{.underline}** (e.g., Gavin, 2010; Muller, 2013a).s
[It should [also]{.mark} be noted that multilateral **Arms Control
treaties apart from the NPT** have been **negotiated in a North-South
forum** such as the]{.underline} Biological and Chemical Weapons
Conventions (**[BWC/CWC]{.underline}**), [and that [recent]{.mark}
**conventional disarmament [treaties]{.mark}** [such as]{.mark} the
Ottawa Convention ([anti]{.mark}-personal **[mines]{.mark}**)
[and]{.mark} the Oslo Convention (**[cluster munitions]{.mark}**)
**[were]{.mark} initiated and [pushed by]{.mark} coalitions of Western
and [Southern middle powers against]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} express will
of **Northern and Southern great powers**]{.underline}
(**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[Russia, China, India]{.underline}). **[The [simple categorization of
West against South is no less ideological and misleading than the traces
of racist thinking in a limited part of the Arms Control
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[**In contrast, Arms Control presents
a solvable puzzle for rationalists** with]{.mark} their [emphasis
on]{.mark} absolute gains and their acceptance of positive sum games and
[the]{.mark}-information and **[transparency providing function of
institutions that manage]{.mark}** and administer Arms Control
**[agreements]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., the classic Axelrod &
Keohane, 1985). The exchange of renunciation and guarantee appears more
plausible to a rationalist when the guarantee is embedded in
institutions that render faithfulness more probable (like
institutionalized alliances), or in deployment patterns that make use of
armed forces in response to an attack more likely (e.g., tripwire-type
deployment). **[[Rationalist liberal institutionalism finds good
empirical confirmation in Arms Control]{.mark} regimes]{.underline}**.
[Indeed, **[most agreements]{.mark}** are endowed with organizations
that serve as channels for communication, arenas for sorting out
behavioral ambiguities of members and clarifying ambivalences in the
language of prescriptions and prohibitions, and [supply **transparency**
by **reporting and verification**]{.mark} and can, after all, take
decisions. [Not only **multilateral treaties**]{.mark}]{.underline} have
such organizations ([[like the]{.underline}]{.mark} International Atomic
Energy Agency \[**[[IAEA]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [working [for the
**NPT**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or the]{.underline} Organisation for the

8.3 Dual-use Governance and Securitization Theory

[**Dual-use [governance]{.mark}** [has proved]{.mark} an
[interesting]{.mark} issue area [for]{.mark} the [**application** of
**securitization theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, this research has
drawn attention to the role of epistemic communities and scientific
consensus positions on given issues in the context of complexity and
uncertainty (Buzan, Wæver, and Wilde 1998, 72--73). In particular, this
work has emphasised the fundamental impacts of the emergence of these
factors on agenda setting and problem definition. Added to this, the
work has drawn attention to the idea that systemic risks are made
governable rhetorically with reference to complex webs of collaboration
between institutions in the development and implementation of risk
governance activities. This includes, for example, bio-preparedness
models of governance which have developed in the US and Europe. However,
the work also draws attention to the idea that such collaboration faces
a series of political challenges, particularly in the context of
anticipatory modes of governance which attempt to deal with challenges
beyond the scope of existing risk management structures.

Second, this work has outlined that [it is in this context that actors
(including state and nonstate institutions) engage in two key modes of
engagement with security politics. The first is the primary mode, which
involves **engagement** in activities designed to **set the rules** for
future **policy making processes** in relation given issue. This
includes, for example, deciding **which institutions** are in charge of
developing and implementing policies, and the **nature of collaboration
between actors within these processes**]{.underline}. Within this work,
it has been argued that the epistemic communities embodied in the NSABB
and Sloan report processes, for instance, have been central to such
processes.

[The other mode of engagement is secondary, which involves engagement in
the context of agreements about the overall process of policy
development. Within this mode of action, actors seek to impact directly
on the policies which are being developed and implemented. This may
include initiating, **advocating**, facilitating or **resisting**
**specific initiatives**]{.underline}.

Third, this work has outlined the extent to which [**policy models** are
useful to those who study processes of **securitization** in the context
of systemic risks]{.underline}. In chapter three, it was argued that
[these models could provide focus, structure and limits within analysis,
which are of central importance in interdisciplinary studies, as well as
in **multi-level approaches**, and that this could **help** the
**analyst to identify which activities, discourses and actors are and
are not relevant with regard to policy outcomes**]{.underline}.

It is certainly the case that these models performed these roles in two
important senses. First, they provided a central narrative for the life
and death of single initiatives and policy proposals. For example, [they
allowed for the exploration of the extent to which forwardlooking
oversight proposals have been rejected within political and policy
streams within the US]{.underline}. A case in point is recommendations
made by the NSABB in relation to synthetic biology research and
technology, which have often struggled to garner federal US support.
Another example was the 2004 bio-hazard non-proliferation proposal of
George Church, which was dropped in favour of other governance options
developed within the academic channel of polynucleotide synthesis policy
development.

It was also argued in chapter three, that [such **policy models** could
provide a straightforward **institutionally, historically and
politically situated 'environment' for discourses and 'speech-acts'** to
occupy within an overall process of **securitization**]{.underline}.
Such claims were made in the context of the concern that **[[analysts
studying securitization processes who rely on a linguistic
approach]{.mark} may [struggle to adequately account for the
socio-historical context of speech acts, and to sufficiently trace the
impact of such acts on policy outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Simply
put, it was argued that [some approaches focus much more on those
'speaking' security in relation to an issue, and much less on those
actually developing and implementing security policy. During the
**analysis process**, **[policy]{.mark} process models** provided a
**[framework]{.mark}** to [help]{.mark} understand **why actors were
speaking security in some contexts**, and **[what the actual
implications of this was for emerging policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
key example related to the NEST domain, where the scientific community,
as well as associated social scientists, have been identified as a first
line of defence in dealing with dual-use issues. [Placing these
assertions in a broader political context, however, **[revealed the
extent to which]{.mark} these [claims were contested]{.mark}**, as well
as **the extent to which such [assertions often belied low levels of
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further to this, reasons were given to
explain why NEST initiatives were struggling within both a US and UK
context to transform innovation practice, as well as to encourage key
regulators to engage pre-emptively with broader dual-use concerns.

#### [Our biotech reps]{.underline} are a [criticism of]{.underline} -- [NOT complicit]{.underline} with -- racist scientific epistemologies -- calling for [entangled responsibility]{.underline} [facilitates]{.underline} expanded political imagination

life in the Anthropocene," Contemporary Political Theory, 9-20-2018,
DOI: 10.1057/s41296-018-0265-9 /GoGreen!

Biopolitics was once the preserve of critical Foucauldian-influenced
theorists. This is no longer the case. The rise of new materialisms,
networked and object-oriented ontologies and demands for the
'renaturalization of politics' (Grosz, 2011; Sharp, 2011) have turned
the political into the biopolitical in much of radical contemporary
political theory. Here, the biopolitical is often in tension with the
Foucauldian discourses of the last few decades, affirming alternative
possibilities rather than merely critiquing regimes of power (Malabou,
2008; Kirby, 2011; Taussig, 2018). One factor in this shift has been the
impact of anthropogenic climate change and global warming on the
contemporary political imagination, increasingly refracted through
conceptualizations of the Anthropocene (Tsing, 2015; Cohen et al., 2016;
Chandler, 2018). A second factor has been that [the life sciences no
longer appear to support understandings of deterministic differences but
rather to cast evolution in sympoietic and entangled ways, making
biology appear as no longer essentialising but as increasingly
importable into politics, in ways which disrupt modernist or liberal
conceptions of the culture/nature divide]{.underline} (Haraway, 2016).
Two important but very different engagements, which reflect these
affirmative readings of biopolitics, are reviewed here, from the fields
of postcolonial literature and gender and race in international
politics. I'd like to start by laying out the insights and framing of
Stephanie Fishel's The Microbial State. This book is a well-worked
deployment of the new materialist thesis of the world of 'lively matter'
(the cover and publicity blurb feature a ringing endorsement from
leading political theorist Jane Bennett). Fishel locates her work firmly
in the camp of posthumanism, counterposing the modernist, 'anthropic'
account of the state as 'the body politic' to one that takes into
account the 'biospheric' and the 'microbial' (p. 2). The key conceptual
point is to highlight that the biological is crucial to the bounded
imaginary of the state as a community analogous to the human body. Both
these conceptions of the bounded political subject -- the individual in
liberal political theory and the state in international theory -- are
products of the biopolitical blurring of culture and nature in atomising
and essentialising ways. Fishel critically uses the life sciences as a
lens for alternative political imaginaries of complex and overlapping
communities, which seek to overcome the homogenising 'body' metaphors of
contemporary political discourse and the 'autonomous and autarkic'
subjects of the biopolitical they produce (p. 15). [Thus we move well
beyond]{.underline} Foucault's Biopolitics 1.0, [where biopolitics is a
technology of management and control. Instead]{.underline}, Fishel
provides [[a '**reversal of biopolitical
critique**]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that [**[emphasizes]{.mark}
vitality connection and [entangled
responsibility]{.mark}**']{.underline} (p. 21): 'This book takes life as
a creative intensity that can offer new solutions, and new ways of
engaging with the world' (p. 21). [In the inversion or 'reversal' of
biopolitical critique, the world and its entangled relationality
**becomes [a]{.mark} potential [cure]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
dangerous [**'immunitarian'** and **essentialising biopolitical logic of
individual and state**]{.mark} **rights and
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} (p. 27). [The **metaphors of
entanglement**, contamination, sympoeisis and intra-active becomings can
**[facilitate]{.mark} and enable [a new]{.mark} (multi-species)
[politics, capable of addressing]{.mark}** the crises of global warming
and species **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Anthropocene.
Perhaps the most important conceptual move, in a range of interesting
treatments, is the importance attached to the 'microbial' of the book
title. [Modernist, or human-centred, views of development and security
**treat the human or the state as separate** and distinct entities and
therefore as the referent for politics, through metaphors of conflict
and militarism -- with treatment as 'intervention']{.underline}, germs
as 'enemies' or the 'war' against cancer (p. 49). Microbial and other
[entangled or relational metaphors **enable alternative ontologies of
being and becoming**]{.underline}. If we seriously want to tackle
contemporary problems, perhaps the starting point should instead be to
ask, 'What would a microbe do?' (p. 56) Microscopic bacteria may seem
'small and simple' but they are what enable life to exist and highlight
that living organisms are enmeshed in their environments, inside and
out, enabling us 'to envision political community as an assemblage of
multispecies groupings' (p. 56). Microbes [enable us to go beyond
binaries of self and other and to bring 'system-based understandings of
complex processes' to the political realm, enabling 'different forms of
practice for sustainable, ethical, global living with one another, and
with other life forms, as a bodies politic']{.underline} (p. 61).
[Processual and entangled ways of understanding politics change our
attitude to problems and their governance; the questions become 'more
about various ecological relationships and balance, rather than
resistance to invasion']{.underline} (p. 63). [Key]{.underline} to
microbial political possibilities [is the removal of the keystone of
modernist politics -- the individual as subject -- which 'places the
separateness of the human being as its most important
trait']{.underline} (p. 69). '[**[Biologically]{.mark}**, at least,
**[we are not]{.mark} intrinsically [individuals, but collective
super-organisms]{.mark}**, assimilating multiple species and millions of
individual organisms']{.underline} (p. 68). [Microbial worlds **[enable
us to question liberal and rationalist approaches]{.mark}** that
prioritise the individual over all other entities and collectives (this
**chimes well with other**]{.underline} feminist science
studies-informed **[work, equally suspicious of a liberal rights
framework]{.underline}**, for example, Clarke and Haraway, 2018).
Microbially-imagined or posthuman forms of governance enable creative
awareness that '\[I\]n Kantian and humanist terms, an individual is
always an end, not a means; therefore, the will of the individual cannot
be sacrificed without consent' (p. 69). Thus in Fishel's reworking of
the biopolitical, key targets are liberal conceptions of 'freedom' (p.
69), ['sovereignty, law and democracy']{.underline}, which [will need to
be redefined]{.underline}. [Microbes enable us to see the artifice
behind the distinctions of liberal political theory, of separate
entities with distinct rights and interests: 'From this perspective it
is impossible not to see the similarities between relationships in the
internal relations between members of microbiotic communities in the
human gut and the relations between member of a political
society']{.underline} (p. 75). [Rather than conflictual
self-interests]{.underline} -- the stuff of human-centred political
communities -- microbes [**enable us [to imagine a politics of
collaboration]{.mark}**: 'the human gut, in this book... is exemplified
as a community in which very few relationships are
pathogenic']{.underline} (p. 87). [The microbial message of
multi-species becoming is clear, with '**new definitions of health for
the state based on expanded notions of health through
plurality**]{.underline}... plurality and stimulation, not autonomy and
purity, lead to strength' (p. 90). Fishel is [well aware that what I am
calling 'Biopolitics 2.0' -- with its affirmative use of biological
metaphors -- runs the risk, associated with all imports from biology
into the political, of carrying 'illiberal and conservative
connotations', but]{.underline} she stresses that ['modern biology and
current biological thinking' are different, 'no longer based on static
equilibrium or a bare struggle for survival expounded by neo-Darwinist
theories of evolution']{.underline} (p. 101). [Rather than fixed
entities fighting for distinct interests, microbial imaginaries are ones
of collective and sympoietic becoming. This is a process of constant
change and transformation, of 'posthuman becoming' and 'biocultural
hope'; entanglements with others make all of us 'co-evolved
symbionts']{.underline} (p. 102) [where 'the world is a joint product
between the human and the non-human... composing the world
together']{.underline} (p. 105). Fishel's thesis of ['the reversal of
biopolitics' claims to '**[open a space to reformulate
biopolitics]{.mark} more positively [by affirming life as vital and
relational rather than a]{.mark} purely [mechanical reaction against
that which is Other']{.mark}**]{.underline} (p. 108). Fishel is keen to
flag up that in 'mining the hermeneutic potential of the life sciences'
(p. 113) she is **[[not forwarding 'science as a Western imperial
project']{.underline}]{.mark}** (p. 116) -- [but seeking rather 'to
redesign, traverse, and complicate the body politic' through using
'alternate visions of science' to 'demonstrate that hybridity and
heterogeneity are necessary elements for understanding the nature of the
individual and the individual's connection to the larger
world']{.underline} (p. 116). [The contemporary biological turn -- with
its rejection of Darwinist conceptions of 'survival of the fittest' and
imaginaries of the 'tree of life' with separate and distinct lines of
evolution -- here provides **[a powerful critique of liberal imaginaries
of security]{.mark} and development, [with]{.mark} the underlying
deterministic [telos of hierarchy, competition and
progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The ideas of the contemporary life
sciences]{.underline} -- which are rewriting nature as creative and
interactive rather than as passive and determined and emphasise
hybridity, transference across species boundaries, symbiosis and
sympoietic becoming -- would [seem [a **vital source of inspiration for
alternative political imaginaries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second
book under review, Deepika Bahri's Postcolonial Biology, engages the
biopolitical moment from the angle of rereading and deconstructing
embodied themes of transformation, hybridity and transference across
racialized boundaries in postcolonial literature. It is productive to
read her book alongside Fishel's as Bahri both complicates and
reinforces the points made above regarding the political and conceptual
productivity of biologically-informed political imaginaries. Bahri
states from the outset that her book 'claims biology as a valid --
indeed a crucial -- area of interest for critical postcolonial studies'
as ['\[T\]he socio-political challenges of the twenty-first century
require us to **look beyond biologically deterministic conceptions of
racialized difference** to porous, pliable, and **plastic bodies and
psyches as critically embattled zones of conflict in the wake of
imperial modernity'**]{.underline} (p. viii). Bahri's point is that [the
blurring of the nature/culture divide and the view of life as hybrid,
processual, disruptive and transformative -- rather than differentiated,
deterministic and static -- is **not simply the preserve of contemporary
posthumanist theorists** but was **already present in colonial
discourses of governance** with the 'implicitly reincarnative politics
of the so-called civilizing mission in imperial modernity']{.underline}
(p. 2). [**[Whilst it is easy to cast modernity as hegemonised by
a]{.mark} Darwinian ['racist science' which 'assumed]{.mark} that
[genetics locked in differences]{.mark} between races', the colonial
gaze, in fact, 'implied** an as-yet scientifically unverified but
implicit **[belief in human bioplasticity]{.mark} and aesthetic
reformation'**]{.underline} (p. 3). [Ideas of distinct bounded
bio-social political communities -- or bodies politic -- 'were
complicated by imperial designs on impressionable, plastic body-minds at
the level of ideology as well as the micromanagement of the subject's
bio-physiology']{.underline} (p. 3). For Bahri, [today's new materialist
or posthuman ontologies of human and non-human entanglement of nature
and culture can be read as **[already implicit in, and]{.mark} also** as
**[a response to, colonial discourses]{.mark}** of civilizing
mission]{.underline} (p. 3). Bahri highlights that Darwinian
perspectives, with their implied lines of genetic determination, were
not as dominant in the early twentieth century social sciences as
socio-biological discourses of indeterminism, with Lamarckian views of
acquired characteristics the bridge between culture and race (p. 152 n.
25). [Colonial and postcolonial views of the bio-social thus become an
'instructive precursor to the nexus of capital, corporation, and the
biopolitics of hybridity in the global present']{.underline} (p. 5).
**[While old biological determinism produced 'bad science and even worse
politics']{.underline}** (p. 6), [the **construction of the body as
'pliant, bio-mentally plastic and permeable'**]{.underline}, for Bahri,
**['is a battlefield no less worthy of our urgent
attention']{.underline}** (p. 6). [Thus the contemporary revisiting of
**the biopolitical** -- Biopolitics 2.0 -- is perhaps **more usefully
understood as a struggle**]{.underline} waged on the grounds of a
Lamarckian creationism, [where **[bottom-up 'bio-cultural hope']{.mark}
stands as [a]{.mark}n open and creative [counter to top-down views of
the manipulation of hybrid becomings]{.mark}, central to the colonial
mission**]{.underline}. Bahri examines how colonial discourses operated
not on a strict separation between biology and culture, but rather on
the construction of a sliding scale interconnecting nature and culture,
which imbricated both the life sciences and the humanities, constructing
them as distinct and yet flexibly co-constitutive disciplines. It was
this continuum that enabled ideas of racial distinction and genetic
determination to easily morph back and forth with ideas of social,
cultural and environmental hybridity and transformation. The colonial
civilizing mission inevitably overlaid views of fixed genetic
distinctions and determinations with bio-social discourses of epigenetic
transformation, which blurred the distinction between culture and
nature, enabling colonial hierarchies to be constructed and played out
through transformative imaginaries that biologized cultural attributes.
Bahri draws out well how these colonial discourses exposed the 'weak
link' of modernist or Enlightenment thought, in politicizing the
biological as the keystone of Otherness. In the bio-social construction
of the Other as inferior there is the implication that the outside is
always already present on the inside, as more real or 'authentic'. Thus,
[in]{.underline} her [citing]{.underline} of [Fanon]{.underline}, [for
the colonial mind, it is always the Other who is the 'bringer of
biology' or the one who 'symbolizes the biological']{.underline} (p.
29). Bahri's book engages with three novels, all of which deal with
postcolonial framings of hybrid becoming: Salman Rushdie's Midnight's
Children; Hari Kunzru's The Impressionist; and Julian Barnes' Unofficial
Englishmen, Arthur and George. The key characters in these novels all
aspire to becoming other, confronting postcolonial biology through
discourses of culture and aesthetics with the body as the site or
battleground of bio-cultural adaptive transformation. It is the
'biological body, its sounds, odours, excretions, urges, emissions, and
expressions' upon which the 'civilizational project' is expressed and
measured (p. 11). Culture and nature are conflated at the same time as
they are constructed as two poles of the human and the non-human. [The
key point being made is that **[the politics of race is an epiphenomenon
of]{.mark} a deeper and more essential aspect of modernist and
Enlightenment thought, the [distinction between 'culture' and 'nature',
which overcodes racial and colonial discourses]{.mark} of
'civilization'** and today's 'developmental aesthetics']{.underline} (p.
135). Bahri's work is also useful to understand today's import of the
contemporary life sciences into radical political imaginaries, as she
seeks to draw from the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School, who
maintained the colonial 'sliding scale' but used this to critique the
empty and 'hollowed subject' of the bourgeois rationalist Enlightenment
(p. 31). The continuum and interplay between the biological and the
socio-cultural-political was maintained, but [the radical goal was to
return to an awareness of the interdependencies, interconnections and
entanglements of the 'biological'. While the colonial civilizing mission
sought to develop a bio-social science of transformation and hybridity
to enable 'becoming modern' or 'becoming liberal', the radical response
was to flag up the artifice and hubris of modernity's attempt to repress
or erase our entangled biological being. Thus for Biopolitics 2.0, with
a more affirmative framing of nature and the biological, the weak link
-- exposed by the colonial discourse of 'civilizing mission' and
blurring of the biological and cultural -- can be turned against the
advocates of the modernist episteme. Having understood the inherently
oppressive logic of 'instrumental rationality' and the human/non-human,
nature/culture hierarchical divides, the way is then clear for the
return of biology as an alternative way of conceiving 'life' without
modernist/colonial binaries and bifurcations]{.underline} (p. 142).
[Thus **[it is possible for]{.mark} the [colonial discourses of
plasticity]{.mark} with their 'vague sociobiological
indeterminism'**]{.underline} (p. 152 n. 25) **[[to become repurposed
for imagining]{.mark} creative and open [alternative
futures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The underlying stakes in
biologically-inflected discourses of transformative and hybrid becoming
were inevitably imbricated within universalist and modernist paradigms
of development and progress. This is still the case today, except that
the idea of the 'sliding scale' of civilization is transposed. In the
Anthropocene, ideas of the superiority of the 'human' over the
'nonhuman' or of 'culture' over 'nature' or of 'civilized' over
'indigenous' have lost their credence. It is little surprise that the
crisis of modernity has enabled the inversion of hegemonic, modernising
and colonial frames of transformation. This fundamental shift, nurturing
a new and affirmative assessment of the life that was previously
repressed or excluded]{.underline} is well reflected in the two books
reviewed here. [[Whereas]{.mark} Foucauldian-informed **[biopolitical
critique railed against]{.mark} the [reduction of the human to 'bare
life']{.mark}**, or of political life to biological existence,
**Biopolitics 2.0 [inverses the assumptions, seeking to reinvest 'mere
life' with]{.mark} meaningfulness and [value]{.mark}**: even life in its
smallest and simplest microbial forms can make the human look
insignificant and **[facilitate more creative political
imaginaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The Threat of Biological Weapons: A Justification of Biological Weapons
Securitization]{.underline} 1. Introduction [In 2001]{.underline}, when
[attacks were carried out in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [involving]{.underline} Bacillus anthracis, the
bacterial agent that causes [anthrax]{.underline}, the threat of
biological weapons came into sharper focus for the American government.
[These attacks were not the beginning of the biological weapons threat,
but rather a point along a continuum of increasing risk]{.underline}.
Article 1 of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention defines biological
weapons to include the "microbial or other biological agents, or toxins,
whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in
quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective, or
other peaceful purposes" as well as the "weapons, equipment, or means of
delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or
in armed conflict"1. The [use of biological weapons dates back
centuries, but the fear of biological weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}, here defined as weapons [that pose an
existential threat]{.underline} to the target, [is relatively
recent]{.underline}2. Much of it is attributable to the rapid advances
made in the biological sciences over the past decade, particularly with
respect to the field of genomics, where there is a growing ability to
manipulate genes3. This knowledge has a variety of applications in the
field of bioweapons. Additionally, while states use of biological
weapons was a concern through much of the 20th century, the possibility
that rogue states or non-state groups would use biological weapons was
largely ignored until the start of the 21st century1. Therefore, [the
threat of biological weapons has been framed as a security
issue]{.underline}4. This essay examines whether, and to what degree,
the threat of a biological weapons attack has been overstated with
respect to the government's response by drawing on securitization
theory, which critically evaluates the process through which an issue
comes to be viewed through a security framework. In addition, the essay
will also use the precautionary principle, described by the 1998
Wingspread Statement as the notion that "when an activity raises threats
of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures
should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not
fully established scientifically"5. Though more often applied to
considerations of environmental risk, in the case of biological weapons,
the principle could be used to justify caution even in the absence of
consensus surrounding the probability of an attack, simply due to the
severity of the consequences if an attack was to occur. It will be
argued that [the biological weapons threat has not been overestimated
and that the biodefense measures expressed in current policy and funding
decisions are warranted]{.underline}. Despite measures such as
likelihood-adjusted mortality, which may suggest the U.S. government
response is an overreaction, other characteristics of [the bioweapons
threat justify its securitization and resulting prioritization in the
government agenda]{.underline}. To do this, the essay provides a
discussion of how [the potential consequences of an attack pose an
existential threat]{.underline} to the United States, how [there is an
inadequate degree of preparedness]{.underline} for such an event, how
[the mere possibility of an attack is enough to warrant high spending on
preventive and preparative programs, and]{.underline} how [the response
has been appropriately measured given the threat]{.underline}. The focus
will be on the United States government because it has taken such a
prominent role in bioweapon securitization and biodefense funding. A
single country, the US, was chosen as a point of focus to avoid
confusion due to differing levels of threat and response across
countries. Additionally, any exaggerations that may exist in how the
media or the public portray and view the biological weapons threat will
be ignored; though this could be related to the government's decision to
securitize bioweapons, this is a separate issue from government policy
decisions in response to the security threat and is outside the scope of
this paper. 2. Securitization Theory and Biological Weapons
Securitization theory is a constructivist approach informing how certain
issues become framed through a security lens6. It offers a useful
analytical framework for understanding how, why, and what issues come to
be viewed as security threats. Securitization is an active process
wherein a securitizing actor, in this case the American government,
presents and addresses an issue as an existential threat to a particular
group, or referent object7. In these situations, emergency response
measures and extensive resource commitments are considered justified7.
Securitization theory generally promotes desecuritization as preferable
because it avoids the negative consequences of securitization, including
a heavy-handed state response, reduced democratic accountability, and
the narrowing of public choice8. However, it also recognizes that
securitization is sometimes appropriate. [Recent considerations of
securitization theory identify three criteria that, if fulfilled,
justify securitization: an objective, existential threat, a referent
object whose protection promotes human well-being, and a response
appropriately measured to the particular threat]{.underline}6. [In the
case of bioweapons securitization]{.underline}, the second criterion is
less controversial, given that the referent object is human population;
thus, any harm to the referent object would directly reduce a human
well-being. However, the question of whether securitization of
biological weapons meets the other two criteria is more contentious.
[Skeptics may point to Colin Powell's 2003 address to the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [as a case where the
biological weapons security threat may have been exaggerated and
securitization was promoted for political ends]{.underline}, thereby
calling into question the legitimacy of the securitizing actor, the U.S.
government. In his speech, [Powell made the case for an invasion of Iraq
by claiming Iraq had capabilities to produce biological weapons of mass
destruction, including mobile bioweapons labs, a claim that later turned
out to be false]{.underline}9. [Critics also target the policies
resulting from securitization, arguing that the capacity of aggressors
to carry out large scale attacks causing mortality has been
overestimated, calling into question whether an existential threat truly
exists and whether the response has been appropriately
measured]{.underline}10. Government funding may be seen as unjustifiably
skewed in favour of biodefense, defined as the capacity to respond to a
biological weapons attack, to the neglect of other key areas, such as
endemic and pandemic diseases. For instance, Klotz calculated what is
referred as the "likelihood-adjusted mortality" for biological weapons,
pandemic diseases, and endemic diseases by multiplying the probability
of occurrence by an estimate of mortality were an event to occur11. By
comparing these values with government funding allocated to each
category, he demonstrated that biodefense receives more funding than its
likelihood-adjusted mortality estimate would suggest is warranted11.
However, objections have been raised to this argument. Supporters of
biodefense prioritization point to the fact that focusing solely on
potential fatalities ignores other issues, such as the negative social
and economic fallout from an attack12. Additionally, they point to the
possibility that it is more expensive to combat intentional threats,
where there will be an explicit effort to circumvent current practices
by exploiting weaknesses12. It should also be considered that the
probability of one attack is not independent from another, and that an
increasing probability of success may elicit more attempts12. To follow
will be an examination of whether government spending and policies
constitute a justified response to the threat of biological weapons.
Securitization is relevant in that it was a way for decision-makers to
implement the policies they want and is justifiable to the extent that
the programs themselves are necessary and appropriate.
[**[Despite]{.mark} other [consequences]{.mark} of securitization, [such
as public fear]{.mark}, [political manipulation]{.mark}, [and a
heavy-handed response]{.mark}**, which may give the impression of an
overreaction, [the reality is that **securitization** was]{.mark} a
means of enabling the implementation of certain policies and programs
**[necessary to respond to the threat of bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 3. Consequences of an Attack [A
government's decision to securitize an issue is a strategy to make
extreme responses seem justified, and it centers on the perceived
existential risk]{.underline} a threat poses to the population7.
Beginning with a brief history of biological weapons use, this section
will aim to [defend the **framing of biological weapons use as an
existential threat** by examining their ability to cause mortality or to
generate negative social and economic fallout]{.underline}. A brief
discussion of the potential catastrophic consequences of a smallpox
attack will illustrate the argument. The use of biological weapons dates
back centuries. Examples include the Tatars catapulting plague-infected
corpses over city walls at the siege of Kaffa in the 14th century, the
deliberate triggering of a smallpox epidemic among Native Americans via
contaminated blankets in the 18th century during the French and Indian
War, and the contamination of salad bars with salmonella at a restaurant
in Oregon in the 20th century2. However, with the development of the
germ theory during the 19th and into the 20th century, there was an
increase in scientific knowledge about biological weapons10. States
became increasingly interested in such weapons, with Japan establishing
a bioweapons program between 1932-1945, the United States in 1942, and
the Soviet Union in 197313. In 1972, in response to increasing concern
about the threat of biological weapons, the United Nations proposed the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and
Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
their Destruction, more commonly known as the Biological Weapons
Convention (or BWC)14. The treaty came into effect in 1975, and banned
the development, acquisition, and stockpiling of biological weapons1.
However, it failed to halt the research and development of biological
weapons, which have continued into the 21st century. Those who argue
that government response to the biological weapons threat has been
overstated point to very low mortality in previous attacks11. The
anthrax attacks of 2001 in the United States, for example, resulted in
only 5 deaths15. This argument could be used to urge governments to
instead invest resources in areas that consistently cause higher
mortality, such as infectious diseases like AIDS or even the seasonal
flu. However, in carrying out a threat assessment, it is also important
to look at the potential for mortality. Here it has been suggested
future attacks may not be on the same relatively small scale as those in
the past15. It is difficult to produce reliable estimates of fatalities
that might result from an attack; there is huge variation in estimates
and, often, little statistical evidence to support the predictions11.
That said, it is agreed that, in theory, even small amounts of a
dangerous biological agent could cause significant mortality if prepared
and disseminated effectively16. For instance, the WHO estimates that
50kg of B. anthracis distributed upwind of a population of 500 000 would
leave 95 000 people dead and 125 000 more incapacitated17. Other sources
suggest that 100kg of B. anthracis, disseminated via a crop-sprayer,
could kill as many as three million people, and comparable values have
been projected for other agents2,18. Another concern is that a
contagious biological agent will result in person-to-person
transmission, creating a self-sustaining effect not present in any other
weapons class10. While mass casualties are possible, it is also
important to note that, even in situations with few casualties,
biological weapons attacks may have profound social and economic
ramifications3. Such attacks could lead to widespread social panic and
disorder, resulting in self-destructive behaviour and creating what is
called a "societal autoimmune effect" involving increases in crime and
looting19. While there is little evidence to predict this would occur
based on previous disaster situations (such as the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, where the public reaction is
described as effective and adaptive, rather than panicked and
disruptive), it must remain a consideration20. The effects of a
largescale attack involving biological weapons are unknown, and
epidemics of highly fatal diseases may cause serious social
disruption20. The economic consequences of biological weapons attacks
are severe and suggest that investing in defense makes good economic
sense. While there were only five deaths in the 2001 anthrax attacks,
those attacks resulted in tens of billions of dollars in government
spending21. Also, the financial sector may be negatively impacted if
investor confidence plummets3. Similarly, an attack on the agricultural
sector, which accounts for 15% of the United States GDP, could have
severe economic ramifications3. If the biological agent being used is
contagious, there could also be implications for trade and travel
restrictions3. The SARS epidemic of 2003 showed the economic
consequences of a highly infectious disease, essentially "crippling"
some of the most dynamic cities in the world4. The Center for
Biosecurity has estimated the economic cost of a biological weapons
attack in the U.S. could exceed one trillion USD15. In short, there are
social and economic consequences that, considered in conjunction with
the potential for catastrophically high mortality, justify the framing
of biological weapons as a significant existential threat to the United
States. This is illustrated by considering the specific case of
smallpox. The Variola virus, which causes smallpox, is an example of an
agent that, if weaponized and used in an attack, would pose a serious
existential threat to the United States22. It is highly contagious; in a
1972 outbreak in Yugoslavia, even with routine vaccinations, which are
no longer carried out, the disease spread rapidly, with each affected
individual infecting 11 to 13 others23. It is also lethal, with a 30%
fatality rate1. Human populations are highly susceptible because, since
eradication, vaccinations have not been given for 20 years24. Other
features make smallpox an appealing option for bioterrorism: it has no
treatment once symptoms occur; it would not be detected for 7-17 days;
it is physically disfiguring; and the virus is stable in aerosol
form1,24. Perhaps the most problematic aspect of smallpox is that those
infected are contagious before symptoms appear. Simulations have been
carried out, including a 1999 exercise by the Center for Civilian
Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where a terrorist
release of Variola virus grew into a global outbreak, which the health
and emergency response system was unable to control22. Here it could be
suggested that prevention efforts promoted by securitization are the
only option, given the apparent inability to contain a global outbreak
after an attack has occurred. While the dangers posed by the Variola
virus are not contested, skeptics argue that it is too difficult to
acquire to be a real danger10. However, there is significant concern
over unaccounted Soviet Union smallpox samples, and a 1999 U.S. report
pointed to evidence that secret stockpiles of the virus are held by
North Korea, Russia, and Iraq1,25. It has also been suggested that the
terrorist organization Aum Shinrikyo holds quantities of the Variola
virus22. Threat and risk assessments should not rely solely on the
worst-case scenarios of biological weapons attacks, especially since
practical challenges still limit terrorists' ability to conduct attacks
that will have the greatest possible effect. However, it is equally
crucial to be aware of the wide range of consequences of such an attack.
This section has argued that [there could be serious ramifications on
several dimensions, ramifications which **[justify]{.mark} the
[framing]{.mark} of [bio]{.mark}logical [weapons as an existential
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the United States [and warrant
investment in an appropriate response capacity. Securitization,
therefore, played an important role encouraging policy responses that
were justified and appropriate]{.underline}. 4. Preparedness for an
Attack This section will examine the capacity of the United States to
mitigate the consequences of an attack, a primary aim of biodefense.
[For government action to be justified, the **[response must be
appropriate]{.mark}** to the given threat level. The argument will be
that **[this is the case with biodefense programs]{.mark}**, which must
seek to address key weaknesses in the preparedness system]{.underline}.
[There is a general consensus that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has insufficient capabilities to respond
effectively to a biological weapons attack]{.underline}3. Three primary
components of preparedness will be addressed: the ability to detect an
attack, the preparedness of the health care and emergency response
system to respond, and the medical countermeasures that currently exist.
It will be shown that there are important deficiencies in all three of
these areas, further suggesting that [programs aimed at developing a
more appropriate **response capacity** are **not overestimating the
threat** but are both justified and necessary]{.underline}. Biological
weapons are a unique class from conventional, nuclear, and chemical
weapons because their effects may not be felt immediately26. It could
take days before it becomes apparent that an attack has taken place;
this is problematic as immediate treatment may be crucial to survival27.
Oral antibiotics for inhalational anthrax, for example, should be
administered within 48 hours of exposure, which leaves little time for
detection and delivery1. Any delay in detection could result in a large
number of casualties. Additionally, if the weapon agent is contagious,
failure to detect and respond the attack may result in a greater spread
of the infection. For this reason, adequate detection capabilities are
essential to bioterrorism preparedness. [Unfortunately, while funding
for biodefense **[has led to improvements]{.mark}**, such as
biosurveillance systems that seek information on disease outbreaks,
there are still weaknesses in the system]{.underline}15. The systems are
still quite rudimentary, relying on a time-consuming process of
clinician reporting, laboratory diagnostics, and the phoning, mailing,
or faxing of reports15. To improve, biosurveillance must be modernized.
We need more effective electronic reporting, quick, cheap, and reliable
diagnostic tests, and the integration of public health surveillance data
with that from other sectors such as law and intelligence agencies26.
Currently, however, detection systems are not able to detect biological
agents at relatively low concentrations, or to detect multiple
biological agents with a single system, and they are not sufficiently
portable and user-friendly26. Detection ability is further compromised
by poor diagnostic capabilities in hospitals. One U.S. study found that
91.2% of U.S. hospitals surveyed lacked the necessary diagnostic
technology to analyze and identify biological agents28. Hospitals have
been targeted as the weakest link in the preparedness chain, in
particular due to their inability to accommodate a sudden influx of mass
casualties29. It has been found that 60% of hospitals lack such
resources as the supplies, equipment, beds, and staff to respond to a
mass casualty situation28. Consequently, hospitals lack the surge
capacity to attend to patients; this could be disastrous in terms of
victims not receiving life-saving treatment, the failure to quarantine
infectious individuals, and the possibility of social disorder as a
result of public frustration. The problem is that hospitals need far
greater resources to respond to a bioterrorist attack than they do for
everyday functioning30. Practice scenarios have demonstrated this
resource shortage problem on more than one occasion. A simulated attack
on a U.S. city that involved the pneumonic plague resulted in antibiotic
shortages after just three days; the situation worsened until, at the
end of the weeklong simulation, 3700 cases of plague had been identified
and 2000 "deaths" had been reported31. Also of concern is the overall
inadequacy of medical countermeasures for biological weapons, identified
as one of the areas in greatest need of attention15. Of the twelve
biological agents identified as posing the highest threat to the United
States, only anthrax, smallpox, and botulism receive substantial funding
for medical countermeasure development and acquisition15. One reason for
this is that pharmaceutical companies are not as motivated to fund
research and development addressing biological weapons since there is
not as great a commercial market as there is for chronic diseases and
influenza15. Even such practices as decontamination require funding and
improvement. The decontamination procedures for B. anthracis, previously
used in the 2001 anthrax attacks, while effective, were also slow and
expensive, and could not be replicated in a situation with mass
casualties15. In the discussion above, it was argued that [high
government funding is not overestimated but is appropriate and justified
to implement biodefense initiatives **[required to improve response
capacity]{.mark}**. This was done by demonstrating that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is ill-equipped to deal with a
significant biological weapons attack, and that this lack of
preparedness risks further exacerbating the already potentially
catastrophic consequences of a biological weapons attack.
**[Securitization was useful in]{.mark} helping justify [prioritizing
funding]{.mark}** to address this issue]{.underline}. 5. Probability of
an Attack The potentially disastrous consequences of an attack and the
lack of preparedness for such an event have been demonstrated, but
perhaps none of that would matter (or justify prioritizing biodefense)
if the probability of an attack by states or terrorists was negligible,
due to an absence of capacity or will to carry out a biological weapons
attack on the United States. This section will consider the [likelihood
of a biological weapons **[attack]{.mark}** in the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[[by states or
terrorist groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This issue [is hotly contested,
with some groups arguing that the chances of an attack are much lower
than popular fears and perceptions would suggest, while others, like CIA
Director Gross, believe it is "only a matter of time", and predict
another biological weapons attack on the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [before 2020]{.underline}28,32. As noted earlier,
this essay's focus is not on whether media rhetoric is inflated or
public perceptions unrealistic. Rather, it will be argued that the
[**[increasing availability]{.mark}** of biological weapons [and]{.mark}
the **[documented intent of various hostile groups]{.mark}** to acquire
such weapons [make]{.mark} an attack **[more
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is where we see the relevance of the
precautionary principle, as an uncertainty surrounding the probability
of an attack encourages us to adopt the principle, promoting caution
where funding is allocated in light of the dire consequences that may
arise were an attack to occur. Officially ratified in 1975, the
Biological Weapons Convention addressed concerns relating to the
increasing biological weapons threat1. While commendable, the convention
had important flaws including an absence of any formal verification of
compliance by states. For instance, after signing the declaration, the
Soviet Union continued to develop their biological weapons program
(unbeknownst to the global community)33. Soviet defectors later
confirmed the scale of their program, describing a massive, covert
operation34. Other countries have also been alleged to have biological
weapons programs, including Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya, and
Syria33,35. While Iraq has since claimed that its biological weapons
were all destroyed, this has been impossible to verify2. Additionally,
with the recent emergence of biotechnology industries in low and
middle-income countries, most notably Brazil and India, more states are
gaining advanced scientific capacity that could potentially be applied
to biological weapons development and production3. The key here is that
many states now have the scientific and technological capacity to
develop biological weapons, but there is a limited capacity for national
states or international organizations to monitor such a process36. In
the BWC definition of biological weapons, the primary focus is on
intent---both in terms of the purpose of the microbial agent and the
delivery system1. Intent is the determining factor in the classification
of biological weapons, but this is extremely difficult to measure or
prove until after an act has been committed. In the biological sciences,
much research is readily applicable to justifiable ends (vaccines), as
well as hostile ones (biological weapons). The United States will often
accuse other states of hostile intent based solely on the presence of
pharmaceutical and biotechnological expertise necessary for biological
weapons development35. This can be viewed as an area of overreaction to
the bioweapons threat, illustrating how securitization processes seem to
legitimize some bad policy responses as well as good ones. Despite the
fact that most states could use this expertise to develop biological
weapons, the majority does not. This suggests that, while capacity is
present, the intent to use biological weapons is limited. In fact, over
the past century, there is only one confirmed case of a biological
weapons attack by one state on another: Japan's striking against China
in the 1930s and 1940s1. It has been suggested that reasons for this may
stem from fear of retaliation or the difficulties of controlling effects
on civilians and combatants1. Most countries possessing biological
weapons claim their purpose is to deter attacks or biological weapons
use by others35. In the past, the prospect of terrorists using
biological weapons received little attention3. It was generally believed
that terrorists would not be able to engineer biological weapons because
they lacked access to the necessary biological agents, the technological
capabilities, and the specialized knowledge to weaponize and disseminate
a biological weapon10. Skeptics still believe that the advanced genetic
capabilities required to produce biological weapons will not be
available to terrorists in the near future3. For instance, the ability
to process a biological agent into aerosol form, the most effective
delivery method, requires expertise across a wide range of scientific
disciplines32. Also suspect is their ability to account for
environmental and meteorological conditions that may disrupt weapon
dissemination10, 32. However, a changing global and scientific landscape
has led to a greater potential for the acquisition of biological weapons
capacity by terrorist groups. For instance, during the Cold War, the
Soviets reportedly employed approximately 55, 000 scientists and
technicians at 6 biological weapons research labs and 5 production
facilities37. Among other things, smallpox was weaponized into ballistic
missiles and bombs38. In 1997, the United States conducted a visit to
one of these research labs to find that the facility was half empty,
poorly guarded, and that most of the scientists had left39. It is,
therefore, possible that the biological agents, the equipment, and the
human knowledge and expertise have since fallen into the hands of rogue
states or terrorist organizations. Additionally, methods of biological
weapons production are now freely accessible via the Internet, and the
technological requirements are not beyond the means of a determined,
well-funded terrorist organization2. Moreover, recent scientific
advances may support biological weapons production by enabling the
production of a higher yield of high-quality product36. They may also
support more effective weaponization, by making agents more resistant to
environmental hazards or by making agents targetable against specific
biochemical pathways36. As these capabilities spread across the globe,
there will be a greater potential for terrorists to harness and use
these techniques. While the capabilities of terrorists to engineer
biological weapons may have been overstated in the past, this can no
longer be said to be the case. It has been argued that two of the
preconditions for assessing the threat of bioterrorism, vulnerability to
an attack and terrorist capability, are in place; the only remaining
consideration is intent40. It is important to determine whether the
intent to acquire and use such weapons is present among terrorist
groups. While terrorist groups have not often used biological weapons,
it is unclear whether this is due to insufficient capabilities or lack
of intent1. There are a variety of reasons why they may not be
interested in the use of biological weapons, including viewing such
weapons as illegitimate in military combat, risks of tactical failure,
perceptions of high technical difficulty, and concerns about the
indiscriminate nature of a biological weapons attack3. That said,
various terrorist groups, including Aum Shinrikyo and al Qaeda, have a
documented interest in the acquisition of biological weapons, and with
advances in biotechnology and weaponization, their use may become more
attractive2, 41. Experts also point to a shift in terrorist intent:
"post-modern" terrorism aims to inflict the highest mortality rather
than make political statements through violence33. This makes biological
weapons an attractive option for such groups; one estimate suggests that
the cost to cause civilian casualties is only one dollar per square
kilometer for biological weapons, compared to 800 and 2000 dollars per
square kilometer for nuclear and conventional weapons, respectively42.
In a similar vein, the recent "war on terror" has created an
increasingly decentralized terrorist threat; biological weapons are
particularly well-suited to this form of smaller, more informed
terrorist groups28. In short, while the intent to use biological weapons
has been documented in terrorist groups in the past, present
circumstances may make the acquisition and use of biological weapons
more attractive. To conclude, it is difficult to either predict or
prevent a bioterrorism attack, which makes any assessment of attack
probability, by necessity, subject to a high degree of estimation.
However, due to the potential severity of consequences of an attack, the
precautionary principle justifies the government decision to allocate
spending according to the severity of consequences, recognizing a
situation where [it is **better to overestimate than to underestimate**
the probability of an attack]{.underline}. As argued by Michael Moodie
of the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute, "[The odds (of
bioterrorism) are increasing...we **have to [walk a fine line between
hyping the risk...and trying to convince people]{.mark} that it is a
possibility for which [we need to invest
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}"2. 6. Biodefense Funding The essay's
previous sections have argued that a biological weapons attack would
pose an existential threat to the United States, that there is an
inadequate capacity to respond to such an event, and that the
possibility exists for such an attack to occur. This would suggest that
[a substantial amount of government funding should be allocated towards
addressing this threat. The decision to securitize bioweapons
facilitated this process]{.underline}. Critics who believe the threat
has been overstated often argue that the government should not invest so
heavily in biodefense, but instead, improve other sectors, such as
reducing mortality from endemic disease11. Meanwhile, proponents may
argue that a securitized issue should receive more funding than issues
that are not framed as an existential threat4. This section will argue
that [the response]{.underline}, in terms of government spending, [is
justified]{.underline} in that it seeks to protect the public [and has
**not exaggerated the threat of bioterrorism**]{.underline}. This will
be demonstrated by examining the degree of investment in biodefense,
showing that a relatively small amount is allocated specifically to
biodefense. In 2000, the United States federal budget proposed that 10
billion USD be allocated to counterterrorism programs, an increase of
3.3 billion dollars from the previous year10. This covered all forms of
terrorism, but there was a greater focus on biological terrorism than in
the past, with spending on medical countermeasures and defense measures
increasing fourfold from 91 million USD in 1998 to 336.6 million in
20002. These trends intensified after the 9/11 attacks and the
subsequent "Amerithrax" scare. While estimates vary, the consensus is
that, since 2001, the United States government has invested between 50
and 100 billion USD towards research and development in response to the
perceived threat of a biological weapons attack43. One calculation
posited that the U.S. allocated 54.39 billion USD to civilian biodefense
programs between 2001 and 201044. This did not include allocations to
Bioshield, a program designed to address the lack of adequate medical
countermeasures for terrorist attacks; 8.7 billion USD has been
allocated since 200445. However, of civilian biodefense funding, 42.57
of the 54.39 billion USD was directed towards programs with multiple
goals beyond biodefense improvement, such as basic infectious disease
research, programs to improve public health planning and operations, and
improving preparedness for a range of disasters44. One example is the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Hospital Preparedness
Program, which seeks to improve surge capacity in healthcare
facilities44. Some estimates suggest that up to 92% of biodefense
funding has been directed to programs that serve secondary purposes,
such as improving preparedness for disease pandemics and natural
disasters15. One could argue that [the amounts dedicated to biodefense
as a percentage of entire budgets are not very substantial given the
existential threat posed by an attack]{.underline}. The DHHS, the
largest recipient of federal biodefense funding, has a budget of 879
billion USD, of which biodefense made up only 0.5%44. Similarly,
biodefense makes up less than 1% of the Department of Homeland Security
budget, and only 0.10% of the Department of Defense Budget44.
Accordingly, it could be argued that the bioweapons threat does not, in
fact, take as high a priority in terms of government funding as one
might expect, given the associated security risk. Additionally, almost
all of the increases in investments have arisen from new funding; other
sectors are not suffering at the expense of biodefense prioritization12.
High funding is appropriate independent of any controversy relating to
estimates of attack probability, as the precautionary principle would
suggest that decisive action is warranted given the potential for dire
consequences, even with a low probability of the event occurring. These
figures show that [the funding response is not an overreaction but has
been justified and appropriate given the documented threat of biological
weapons, targeting programs that are likely to protect the
public]{.underline}. 7. Conclusion The anthrax attacks of 2001 are a
case where biological weapons were used against the United States in the
absence of any direct provocation. Since then, though the issue is
controversial, biological weapons have been considered an important
threat to U.S. security. This essay [has defended the
**[securitization]{.mark} of the bio**logical **weapons threat** as a
means to an end. It is a process to engage in where it is **[necessary
to get approval for policies that are]{.mark}**, in themselves,
**[necessary and justified]{.mark}**. By analyzing the existential
threat posed by bioweapons, the lack of preparedness by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [for such an event, and the
possibility of an attack, evidence presented in this essay suggests that
these policies and the overall government **response were
appropriate**]{.underline}. Taking these issues into account, the essay
concluded that [the **threat of bioterrorism has not been
overestimated**; it **warrants securitization and the resulting
response** measures. Moving forward now, government must recognize and
respond to the reality of an increasing bioterrorism
threat]{.underline}.

### AT: L -- China

#### China threat discourse doesn't cause war -- BUT the ALT does

**Hagstrom 14** -- PhD, Swedish National Defence College, Department of
Security, Strategy and Leadership (Linus, "East Asia\'s Power Shift: The
Flaws and Hazards of the Debate and How to Avoid Them," Asian
Perspective, 38.3)

[Pan [argues]{.mark} that the [\"China threat discourse\"]{.mark} is
\"always intrin- sically linked to how US policymakers/mainstream China
special- ists see themselves (as representatives of the indispensable,
security-conscious nation]{.underline}, for example)\" (2004, 306).
Hagström demonstrates how the discourse on Japan\'s \"abnormality\" and
\"weakness\" reproduces a standard of \"normality\" in world politics
that is centered on the ability to go to war. Postwar Japan is socially
constructed as deviant from this norm and thus as a threat to itself.
This discourse, which emerges in both Japanese and Western academia and
in Japanese political debate, legitimizes a road map for a more
\"realistic,\" \"active,\" \"responsible,\" and \"nor- mal\" Japan
(Hagström 2014).∂ The power of the power-shift discourse does not stop
at the production of identities and standards. [The point is that
identities and standards [produce effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pan
illustrates this by showing how the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996
was often understood as \"further objective proof of the long-suspected
\'China threat,\'\" but few acknowledged that \"the \'China threat\'
discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that
crisis\" (2004, 323, 320). Moreover, standards in Japan\'s
\"normalization\" discourse have enabled Realpolitik changes in its
foreign security policy. Chinese vigilance vis-à-vis Japan and the
United States might also be interpreted as discursive phenomena-the
theme of national reinvigoration is a product of the lingering notion
that China has been continually humiliated and victimized by the great
powers since the nineteenth century. As these examples illustrate, the
ulti- mate power of discourse is the production of self-fulfilling
prophecies. When self-fulfilling prophecies occur on both sides of a
dyad, we might end up with a socially generated security dilemma
(Johnston 2004).∂ [[Much research]{.mark} has [warned of self-fulfilling
prophecies]{.mark} in the East Asian context. Some observers suggest
that US]{.underline} or Japanese [discourses about China might produce
policies of containment]{.underline}, Japanese \"normalization\" and
\"remilitarization,\" and US \"rebal- ancing\" toward East Asia (Pan
2004; 2012; Hagström 2012; Turner 2014a; 2014b).
**[[Nonetheless]{.mark}, Japan and the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[have not]{.mark}]{.underline}** yet [**[embarked on containing
China]{.underline}**. [Instead, both]{.underline}]{.mark} [countries
have on the whole [accommodated China\'s rise]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Christensen 2006; Jerdén and Hagström 2012). In a similar manner,
perceived increases in bellicose or nationalistic representations in
Chinese discourses led some observers to jump to the mistaken conclusion
that this had already resulted in a more assertive Chinese foreign
policy (Jerdén 2014). As important as it is to remain vigilant against
the emergence of socially constructed security dilemmas, [we need to
bear in mind that [there is **no deterministic connection** between
discourse and policy]{.mark}-just an enabling one. Dominant
[discourses]{.mark}]{.underline} create propensities for action but
**[[do not make]{.mark} any [action inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
More empirically informed theorizing is needed to address the questions
of how, when, and why discourses make some actions politically
conceivable, easy to communicate, and sometimes even coercive (Holland
2013).∂ Reflecting on the possible power exercised through the alter-
native approaches introduced in this special issue is also neces- sary.
In this article we raise analytical and normative concerns about the
ideas of a more \"powerful\" and \"threatening\" China, a \"weak\"
Japan, and a \"declining\" United States. We argue that such
representations risk offsetting balancing policies and a secu- rity
dilemma in East Asia, in line with the self-fulfilling prophecy logic
discussed above. These arguments clearly belong to another site of
discursive power production. That we have not seen any obvious balancing
policies in East Asia thus far might arguably be interpreted as one of
its effects.∂ In fact, our critique of the power-shift debate might
itself be criticized as [[denying or playing down Chinese
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[could have]{.mark} two
[effects]{.mark}]{.underline}: (1) [[China appears less]{.mark} powerful
and thus less [threatening, which allows it to]{.mark} arm itself with
impunity and [behave aggressively; and]{.mark}]{.underline} (2) [the
[Chinese]{.mark} government [can ignore calls to take on]{.mark} more
international [responsibilities]{.mark} with reference to the limited
scope of its power]{.underline}. As William Callahan points out,
attempts to counter the \"China threat theory\" within China often
\"refute \'Chinese\' threats as a way of facilitating the pro- duction
of an American threat, a Japan threat, an India threat, and so on\"
(2005, 711). Adopting a nonintentional power con- cept allows us to see
how even [[critical scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}, inside and out- side
China, [[who]{.underline}]{.mark} profess no interest in exaggerating
threats against China but rather \"[seek to [deconstruct the]{.mark}
discourse of \'[threat,\']{.mark}]{.underline}\" [might [play a
role]{.mark} in **[accelerating this process]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Callahan 2005, 711). In other words, [intentional [attempts to
prevent]{.mark} the emergence of [a self-fulfilling prophecy **may
actually play a**]{.mark}**n unintentional [part in creating
one]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### AT: L -- Cybersecurity

#### No impact to securitizing cyber threats

**Gomez 21** Miguel Alberto Gomez, Senior Researcher with the Center for
Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, PhD
candidate at the University of Hildesheim, Germany; and Christopher
Whyte, PhD, Assistant Professor in the program on Homeland Security &
Emergency Preparedness at Virginia Commonwealth University's L. Douglas
Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs; "Breaking the Myth of
Cyber Doom: Securitization and Normalization of Novel Threats,"
International Studies Quarterly, 5-15-2021, DOI 10.1093/isq/sqab034
/GoGreen!

According to some, advancements in technological and organizational
capabilities among capable state and stateaffiliated actors over the
past decade increase the likelihood that offensive cyber operations
(OCOs) might soon produce destructive physical effects (Saltzman 2013;
Healey 2016). Expectations of real-world damage inflicted through
cyberspace reinforce the "cyber doom" narrative that digital insecurity
might result in a massive failure of social and economic processes
across societies dependent on new information technologies and that
dread of such failure permeates public perspectives on cyber issues
(Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009).

For those who study public opinion surrounding foreign policymaking, the
"cyber doom" type of narrative is not especially uncommon. Environmental
circumstances of sufficient visibility and meaning, such as the
trauma-inducing experiences of 9/11 or the Cold War, often take on life
of their own and affect opinion formation independent of an individuals'
priors or the cues of elites. Oddly, however, [the oft-referenced notion
of "cyber doom" appears paradoxical, even despite the link some scholars
make between OCOs and physical effects]{.underline}.

Presently, conflict in cyberspace is characterized by
persistent-yet-limited effects and a condition of apparent restraint
exercised by cyber-capable actors (Maness and Valeriano 2016;
Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018a). Moreover, [the unabated integration
of vulnerable information systems across all aspects of modern societies
raises the question of whether or not a sense of dread associated with
the exploitation of cyberspace is as severe as commonly
portrayed]{.underline} (Jarvis, Macdonald, and Whiting 2017). Most
damningly, [**[the idea that "cyber doom" is most visible in
Western]{.mark} national [experiences as a fear appeal employed by
politicians to galvanize support for policy in no way explains]{.mark}**
these curious logical **[shortcomings]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[At the heart of the "cyber doom" narrative is the assumption that
information about **cyberattacks**]{.underline} released to the
public---[particularly information about sophisticated **cyber
operations** of **foreign countries** and **organized
crime**]{.underline}1--- [produces **anxiety**]{.underline} about the
digital health and security of a person. Ironically, this assumed
relationship between cyber operations, their portrayal in public-facing
media, and individual impact is often discussed in unclear terms by
scholars than is the determining role of techno-strategic conditions.

[Despite the recent turn by some to consider the societal impact of
OCOs]{.underline} (Lin and Kerr 2017; Lindsay 2020; Whyte 2020), most
research on cyber conflict continues to emphasize logic-of-the-domain
explanations for the behavior of cyber-capable actors.2 This makes a
certain sense because the domain is human-made and malleable. However,
it is also puzzling given the scope of cyberspace and the degree to
which digital action impacts both private industry and civil society
across numerous levels. Though the mechanisms of interaction may be less
precise than is the case with other forms of state power, [the
literature on public opinion, morale, and psychology in foreign
policymaking tells us that popular perceptions of threat are shaped by a
host of factors that then impact the formulation and implementation of
state security policy]{.underline}.

In this article, we take aim at the "cyber doom" narrative logic as an
initial step toward clarifying the relationship between cyber conflict,
its portrayal, and public thinking about digital insecurity.
Consequently, we align with **[[critics of the
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself but argue that such criticisms
[[make **overly simplistic assumptions** about public opinion
and]{.mark} national [security that do little to enrich]{.mark} and
undergird evolving cyber conflict [research]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
logic of the core argument about digital disaster aside,
[the]{.underline} broader "cyber doom" [argument]{.underline}--- i.e.,
[that the rhetorical and cognitive prospect of doom has some effect on a
population---is undertheorized and understudied]{.underline}. [This
point is **particularly important** because scholarship aimed at
explaining the sources of state public policy on cyberspace makes the
curious **misstep** of **holding domestic population preferences
constant** while **focusing on third image determinants of strategy**
development]{.underline}. [Authors argue that publics cyclically react
with some fear to emergent threats and that, therefore, public policy is
best explained by the incidence of cyber conflict or steps taken by
state peers]{.underline}. Given that [**such assumptions** are clearly
**far from safe** on the merits]{.underline}, this article aims to
ascertain whether or not negativity among the general public associated
with malicious behavior in cyberspace is as salient as broadly claimed.
We add evidence to the argument that the "cyber doom" narrative is
unrealistic (Lawson 2013) by showing that the assumptions found therein
are misleading.

Our [[**study** finds]{.mark} that **sensitivity to cybersecurity
threats** is situationally shaped by exposure to negative reporting but
that the onset of associated **dread** is **not a given**. Instead, it
is influenced by expectations of the role of technology in modern
society. Respondents dependent on such technologies are not as prone to
negative effect as are those who remain not so deeply embedded in the
fabric of digital society]{.underline}. Both groups become more
sensitive to cybersecurity threats to their person as the information
they consume becomes more negative, and this personal concern
facilitates a heightened sensitivity to threats to the polity. However,
[the **dread predicted** by the "cyber doom" narrative is **[only weakly
predictive]{.mark}** of this dynamic [and **has no effect** on]{.mark}
the **[threat sensitivity]{.mark}** of those who do not respond
emotionally]{.underline}. Finally, [in both cases, the link between
concern for society is **not a clear result of negative info**rmation so
much as it is the result of initial sensitivity to threats at the
personal level]{.underline}.

Consequently, we make two contributions. First, we show that [the impact
of novel environmental circumstances on individual opinion formation
**is shaped by issue embeddedness**, suggesting that **[long-term
exposure]{.mark}** to any invasive development **[mitigates the
affective response]{.mark}** it is associated with]{.underline}. Second,
we present evidence suggesting nevertheless that the unique
characteristics of such a development matter in opinion formation, as
sensitivity to digital threats to the polity is clearly premised on
personal threat sensitivity.

These findings suggest that not only "cyber doom" is strategically and
functionally unrealistic, but [the [**effects** of]{.mark} the idea's
[**securitization** are]{.mark} also [**minimal** and]{.mark} **prone to
[diminish]{.mark}ment [over time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In doing so,
they **speak to the broad research program** on public opinion and
audience dynamics in **foreign policymaking**]{.underline}. More
specifically, in line with recent work (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017), our
[study suggests that citizens are far more capable of responding to
threat stimuli absent elite cues]{.underline}. Significantly, [our work
joins **[research]{.mark}** that **[locates responsiveness]{.mark}** to
policy issues [in]{.mark} the interaction of **[cognitive
priors]{.mark}** and social context with incoming information about new
events. [**Judgment is rarely as linear** as]{.mark} the "cyber doom"
narrative [suggests **in**]{.mark} its **[linking]{.mark} of [negative
reporting]{.mark}, [fearful response]{.mark}, [and sensitivity to threat
inflation]{.mark}**. Instead, individuals are **conditioned by social
circumstances** such that **even novel threats are incorporated** into
the horizon of issues the public encounters]{.underline}.

[[For the last two decades]{.mark} a strategy employed by health
professionals, [scientists, and diplomats]{.mark} has been to **[play
the 'health security card']{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to
achieve]{.underline} [particular]{.underline}]{.mark} **[trade,
diplomatic, strategic, and development [goals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Elbe 2011). The presumption has been that [the
**[securitisation]{.mark}** of health will [harness global]{.mark}
**political [leadership and resources]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [This
marriage of health issues to security logic has been met with a mix of
applause, caution, and critique]{.underline} (Feldbaumet al. 2010;
McInnes and Rushton 2013; Hanrieder and Kreuder-Sonnen 2014).
[But]{.underline} the presumption has remained that, **[for the most
part]{.underline}**, [the marriage of health issues to security
will]{.underline} '**[harness]{.underline}** political leadership and
**[resources]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} various [international
health issues']{.underline} (Elbe 2011: 220). In the last 15 years,
there have been three United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions
that have specifically referred to health matters -- S/Res/1308 (2000),
S/Res/1983 (2011), both concerning HIV/AIDs, and S/Res/2177 (2014) in
response to the Ebola viral disease outbreak in West Africa. In December
2012, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) passed resolution
A/67/L.36, Global Health and Foreign Policy, the fifth resolution on
global health and foreign policy resolution to pass in the UNGA since
the adoption of the first resolution on Global Health and Foreign Policy
in 2008 (A/63/33). The UNGA also adopted resolution A/69/1 giving
support to the measures recommended by UN Secretary-General to contain
the Ebola outbreak (A/69/389 2014). The decision of the UNSC to adopt
three resolutions on health matters in 15 years and the UNGA sessions on
global health and foreign policy have received mixed views. Some point
to these events as illustration of the weakness of the global health
security narrative (Youde 2014). In particular, it has been noted that
the Ebola outbreak in 2014 was initially met with no international
capacity outside of the World Health Organization (WHO) to respond to
this crisis. The creation of the UN Mission on Ebola Emergency Response
(UNMEER) in September (2014) was the first, and some argue should be the
last, effort to respond to a viral outbreak (Panel of independent
experts 2015). Others contend that, given that there is no procedure
under the UN Charter for the General Assembly or Security Council to
examine health matters -- let alone develop a mission like UNMEER --
broader UN engagement in health beyond the WHO could point to the
success of the global health diplomacy (McInnes 2015). The question is
what does successful global health diplomacy look like? Do we see in
practice the securitisation of health as essential to pursue
international diplomatic engagement in global health? There have been
recent claims that the successful international engagement in health
initiatives such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global
Fund) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have been achieved without
asserting their necessity 'primarily on security considerations'
(McInnes and Rushton 2013: 16; see also Sridhar 2012; Gagnon and Labonte
2011). However, the assumption remains that linking health issues,
specifically health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks to
security discourse will create more opportunities for diplomatic
cooperation and engagement (see Feldbaum et al. 2010; Hafner and
Shiffman 2013). This chapter explores this argument beginning with the
period where the phrase 'global health diplomacy' and 'global health
governance' began to gain usage in international relations in the 1990s.
In the first part of the chapter I briefly present the conceptual
history of health security and its relationship to 'global health
diplomacy'. I explore the argument that the success of global health
diplomacy has come from the preponderant use of security language,
referents, and discourse (cf. Elbe 2011; Feldbaum et al. 2010; Kickbusch
et al. 2007; McInnes and Rushton 2013). In the second part of the
chapter I examine two cases, one where a type of security logic was
deliberately employed to frame the 'health emergency' (Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control or FCTC) and one where human rights logic
was initially deployed when advocating for its creation (the Global
Alliance for Vaccine Immunization or GAVI). I evaluate what 'health
security' looks like in these global health initiatives and explore the
presumption that 'security discourse' must be present in comparing these
two major, successful global health initiatives. HEALTH SECURITY States
have a history of formal international agreements addressing health
matters and health threats, particularly infectious diseases, from the
Decree of Quarantine in Ragusa-Dubrovnik in 1377 (Mackowiak and Sehdev
2002) to the International Sanitary Conference in 1851 (Fidler 2003) and
the revised International Health Regulations in 2007 (Davies et al.
2015). However, [the treatment of [health as a 'low]{.mark} politics'
[priority]{.mark} at the international level [remained]{.mark} the case
[through most]{.mark} of the formative years of
[nation-building]{.mark}]{.underline} in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries (Fidler 1999). This was [in spite of its great strategic
benefit for colonial era expansion, winning wars and rapid
industrialisation]{.underline} (Diamond 1997). In contemporary politics,
a range of actors -- such as foreign governments, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), pharmaceutical companies, private donors, and
international organisations -- drive a variety of different health
agendas that influence priorities within individual states and affect
the resources that are available to individual health workers and
opportunities for patients (Youde 2012). Likewise, the post--Second
World War Bretton Woods system had a profound influence upon health-care
policy and practice around the world, with key lending institutions like
the World Bank promoting particular health-care systems and policies in
their lending programmes (Sridhar 2012). In this period, key discourses
such as 'Health for All', the Essential Medicines List, and Right to
Health emerged in the absence of linkage to security. These discourses
brought in a range of actors including international organisations,NGOs
and transnational corporations with the power to shape health
opportunities and outcomes within and amongst states (Gagnon and Labonté
2011). In the 1990s, however, foreign and defence ministries became
increasingly interested in global health policy -- particularly
infectious diseases -- which would be referred to as having a
'securitising' effect on health (McInnes and Lee 2006). 14 ADVOCATING
GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY 255 During the 1990s, key events combined with a
paradigm shift in International Relations (IR) and security studies
(particularly in Western developed countries with the end of the Cold
War) (Paris 2001) to connect security to health (Enemark 2007; Collier
and Lakoff 2008). Acute awareness was growing amongst Western states
that they were not immune to health events such as infectious disease
outbreaks. The outbreak and spread of HIV across developing and
developed countries during the 1980s; fear of biosecurity attacks with
the breakdown of security in laboratories across the former Soviet Union
(Koblentz 2010); sudden outbreak of the plague in India in 1995 and the
arrival of West Nile virus near New York City in 1999; and the return of
'slow-burn' diseases thought eradicated such as Tuberculosis (TB),
measles and meningitis in the United States, United Kingdom, and
Australia (Price- Smith 2002). As well, new strains of disease, such as
haemorrhagic dengue fever and drug-resistant malaria were on the rise
due to significant climate change impact in South Asia, Southeast Asia,
and Pacific (Kim and Schneider 2013). Andrew Price-Smith argues that
prior to President Clinton's appointment of the National Science Council
on Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases in 1995, developed
states had grown complacent to the fact that 'despite their enormous
technological and economic power, it is extremely unlikely that
developed countries will be able to remain an island of health in a
global sea of disease' (2002: 122). Clinton's move created a wave of
interest in other developed countries, particularly the United Kingdom,
Australia, and Canada, all shifting to appreciate and contextualise
health threats in foreign policy terms (McInnes and Lee 2012: 32). Until
then, on the rare occasion that health policy was discussed at the
international level it was in relation to (mostly) infectious disease
outbreaks such as plague and cholera, or large-scale efforts such as the
mass immunisation programme led by WHO to eradicate smallpox. During
infectious disease outbreaks, emphasis had been squarely placed on the
responsibility of the host state and regardless of the capacity of its
public health system to effectively respond (Fidler 1999). Meanwhile,
the spread and scale of HIV/AIDS raised fears about its potential to
threaten state cohesion and national economies. There was a particular
focus on military forces being at risk of HIV infection, and the
political insecurity these infectious could bring in societies (Singer
2002; Elbe 2006). The apparent potential for HIV/AIDS to cause state
collapse or serious disruption that could ricochet throughout
neighbouring states 256 S.E. DAVIES was considered a realistic scenario
in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as some parts of South and East Asia and
the Pacific (Shisana et al. 2003; Ramiah 2006; Price-Smith et al. 2007).
It was specific reference to the threat of HIV/AIDs on peacekeepers that
led to the first resolution on health, Resolution 1308, being passed in
the UN Security Council in 2000 (UNSC 2000). In response to these
developments, a host of analysts, including Solomon Benatar (1998,
2002), Peter W. Singer (2002), Robert Ostergard (2002), called for IR to
engage with the economic, humanitarian, political, and security
ramifications of the AIDS epidemic. At the same time, David Fidler and
Andrew Price-Smith called for equal attention to the economic,
political, and social insecurity that stems from a range of infectious
diseases already prevalent in countries (Fidler 2003; Price-Smith 2002).
Using quantitative analysis of the relationship between infectious
diseases and state capacity, Price-Smith claimed that 'infectious
disease \[already\] constitutes a verifiable threat to national security
and state power' (Price-Smith 2002: 19). Health security, Price-Smith
(2002: 9) argued, referred to the threat of the disease on particular
populations as well as the country's economic and political stability
becoming unsustainable as a result of a pathogen wiping out the core
population base. While a disease may have a different impact in
different states: \[I\]ncreasing levels of disease correlate with a
decline in state capacity. As state capacity declines and as
pathogen-induced deprivation and increasing demands upon the state
increase, we may see an attendant increase in the incidence of chronic
sub-state violence and state failure. State failure frequently produces
chaos in affected regions as neighbouring states seal their borders to
prevent the massive influx of disease-infected refugee populations.
Adjacent states may also seek to fill the power vacuum and may seize
valued territory from the collapsing state, prompting other proximate
states to do the same and so exacerbating regional security dilemmas.
(Price-Smith 2002: 15) In a similar vein, David Fidler's seminal 1999
book International Law and Infectious Diseases argued that with the
increased risk of drug-resistant microbes in the twenty first century,
as identified by public health officials (Institute of Medicine 1992;
Heymann 1996), it will become important to 'understand the international
politics of infectious disease control, or microbialpolitik' (Fidler
1999: 19). Microbialpolitik, argued Fidler, was 'wrapped up not only in
traditional concerns such as sovereignty and power but also in the
implementation of scientifically sound infectious disease policies at
the national and international levels' (ibid.). Both Fidler and
Price-Smith argued that the risk of newly emerged infectious diseases
and drug-resistant infectious diseases required that all governments
engage with the problem as if they were threats to national security.
Likewise, Laurie Garrett argued in 2001 that 'a sound public health
system, it seems, is vital to societal stability and, conversely, may
topple in the face of political or social stability or whim. Each
affects the other: widespread political disorder or anti-governmentalism
may weaken a public health system, and a crisis in the health of the
citizens can bring down a government' (Garrett 2001: 5). These ideas
continued to influence the global politics of health into the
twenty-first century (Fidler 2009; Davies 2012). In a 2010 study on the
influence of global health on foreign policy, Feldbaum and his
colleagues found that most discussion and policy from diplomatic
engagement focused on the interplay of national interests and security,
which meant that most diplomacy focus and discussion was on the
containment of infectious diseases (Feldbaum et al. 2010: 87). At the
time, WHO also immersed itself in the health security argument:
Collaboration between Member States, especially between developed and
developing countries, to ensure the availability of technical and other
resources is a crucial factor not only in implementing the
\[International Health\] Regulations, but also in building and
strengthening public health capacity and the networks and systems that
strengthen global public health security will. (WHO 2007: 13) [Of
course, health diplomacy refers to the pursuit of international health
**cooperation**]{.underline} on matters of concern to states (Kickbusch
et al. 2007). [It is the amalgam of cooperation in areas where there is
the possibility of **genuine**]{.underline} technical
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [for a diverse range of
diseases]{.underline} (Youde 2012: 25). [However, [because
health]{.mark} diplomacy [involves]{.mark} the interplay of **[national
interests, power and diplomatic compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline},
'[[state interests have been critical to]{.mark} either the success or
obstruction of such [agreements]{.mark} . . . [and **issues of**]{.mark}
**national [security remain atop the foreign-policy
hierarchy']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Feldbaum et al. 2010: 87). The
counter-narrative to the health security discourse described above is
that the securitisation of health promotes an instrumental pursuit of
health. To capture foreign policy interest and engagement, global health
discussions produce a 'hierarchy of illnesses' whereby some health
issues receive interest and resources whilst other equally deadly health
matters do not (Youde 2012: 160). Jeremy Shiffman's (2006: 411--420)
work on the peaks and troughs of investment in global health initiatives
has revealed that despite disease burden to a population, some
infectious diseases (i.e. HIV/AIDS) consistently attract stronger
short-term investment from donor states -- primarily those that are
contagious or linked to the national security interests of donor states.
However, it would be a mistake to assume that the threat of infectious
disease alone encapsulated all diplomatic engagement with health issues
at the turn of the twenty-first century. The rise of non-traditional
security has also been attributed to the increased influence of the
introduction of different social science methods and theories to
International Security Studies (Buzan and Hansen 2009: 188). This has
influenced research into the subject matter of security studies and IR.
If insecurity and grievances amongst the population played a large part
in the civil wars that gripped the 1990s (Fearon and Laitin 2003),
engagement with health is not just a security concern for developed
states [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also for developing states. In other
words, [appreciations of health [security were **not
one-dimensional**]{.mark}. It was possible to advocate for a vision of
health security that [sought to protect **individuals as much as
states**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, a human centred appreciation of
security -- coined 'human security' by the 1994 United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report (see MacFarlane
and Khong 2006) -- sought to redefine the 'traditional' security with
issues and concepts under the umbrella term 'non-traditional' security,
including health (Chalk 2006). Thus, there does appear to be a
significant relationship between international health events and the
direction of research and policy engagement (Davies 2012). In the last
decade, events such as the United Nations Security Resolution on
HIV/AIDS (S/Res/1308) and SARS create an explosion of IR engagement with
global health governance, particularly in the area of health security.
This 'phenomenon' has been witnessed again with the Ebola outbreak
(Youde 2014). Amongst all these engagements, two key approaches have
emerged. First, those who accept the inevitability of a 'narrow'
approach to health and IR, focused on infectious diseases and
bioterrorism as security threats (Koblentz 2012). Alternatively, there
are those who articulate a broader vision related to development, state
capacity, and cross-national health issues (Shiffman 2006; Nunes 2014;
Rushton and Williams 2012). One of the central claims of the former
approach is that [health securitisation is an effective way of
**galvanising diplomatic engagement amongst states and other actors**,
resulting in the allocation of political will and material
resources]{.underline} (Collier and Lakoff 2008; Elbe 2011; Hafner and
Shiffman 2013). In the next part of the chapter I examine this core
assumption. In particular, I explore whether the effectiveness of health
initiatives is tied to their securitisation, focusing on the examples of
two major health initiatives. I examine the Tobacco Free Initiative
(TFI) and the GAVI. Interest in these two cases comes from exploring the
above presumption that security and health, particularly concerning
infectious diseases, drives, and delivers policy momentum. While there
is debate about whether that momentum translates into 'real' policy
progress or whether it is mere rhetoric deployed at particular
crises/events with no lasting impact, there is no debate that health
security has dominated global health and foreign policy discourse
(Feldbaum et al. 2010; McInnes and Rushton 2013). Below, I briefly
examine the dominance of health security in successful global health
initiatives -- one where you would expect it to be deliberately deployed
(GAVI) and one where it was not (TFI). TFI and GAVI, I contend, are
interesting cases precisely because they confound the issueframing
conventions about the relationship between health and security.
CONFOUNDING EXPECTATIONS A global health initiative is defined in this
chapter as 'an emerging and global trend in health. They are usually
focused on state, international organisation and public--private
partnerships. Global initiatives typically target specific diseases and
are supposed to bring additional resources to health efforts' (WHO
2015). Case Selection and Discourse Analysis This section briefly
compares two international health initiatives: the TFI and GAVI. The TFI
sought to reach an international agreement under international law that
countries would adopt to regulate the sale and production of tobacco.
This global health initiative was in aid of preventing the unchecked
rise of tobacco related illnesses -- non-communicable diseases --
including cancer (various), emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and
diabetes (to name a few). In the case of the TFI, and in light of the
260 S.E. DAVIES literature discussion concerning health security above,
it would be expected that there was little to no presence of security
discourse in the early days of this initiative. It was (and is) about
introducing tobacco control legislation, addressing unregulated sale and
distribution of tobacco to address preventable tobacco-related diseases
in young populations in already over-burdened public health-care systems
(Roemer et al. 2005). In contrast, the GAVI is a public and private
partnership between states, international organisations, pharmaceutical
companies, and philanthropic donors that sought cooperation amongst this
diverse group of actors to manufacture, purchase and deliver life-saving
vaccines against deadly infectious diseases in the most remote,
dangerous and impoverished locations around the world. GAVI is,
ostensibly, the initiative where it would be expected to see initial
employment of 'security' rhetoric given it is addressing the health
insecurity of under five children in need of vaccination from, mostly,
contagious infectious diseases. In fact, the immediate previous
iteration of GAVI -- the Child Vaccination Initiative -- used security
type discourse such as 'mission', 'operation', and 'threat'' under the
steerage of a former US defence army medic (see Muraskin 2002). These
cases were also selected because they shared some important features.
Both the TFI and the GAVI are concerned with one specific health concern
-- tobacco and immunisation; both were launched within a similar time
where health security discourse was gaining policy attention; both
initiatives required the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including
national governments, to enjoy success. The main difference, of interest
to this chapter, is that the association of security with the health
issue confound the type of cases analysed to date in the IR literature
on global health security. I reveal below that the non-communicable,
'slow moving' health threat engaged more securitised discourse than the
high morbidity communicable health threat. The comparison of the two
cases was organised around a common framework involving three steps. 14
ADVOCATING GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY 261 First, understanding the rhetoric
and concepts used to frame the initiative. Each initiative has produced
a significant volume of material outlining its purpose, scope and
mandate. For the purposes of this chapter, I focused on the 'founding'
document for each initiative. In the case of TFI, the Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted by the World Health Assembly in
2003, 8 years after the Convention was first proposed in the 1995 World
Health Assembly. The Framework Convention was the outcome of the TFI and
details 'a regulatory strategy to address addictive substances; in
contrast to previous drug control treaties, the WHO Framework Convention
asserts the importance of demand reduction strategies as well as supply
issues' (WHO 2003). Included in the Framework Convention document
analysed is an Annex 2, which details the history of drafting the
Framework from 1995 to 2003. For GAVI, the document analysed is the GAVI
Meeting of the Proto-Board in Seattle, July 1999. This document details
GAVI's terms of reference, mission, objectives, functions, structure,
milestones, and budget priorities. An interest in the discourse used in
the founding document of each initiative is informed by the premise
outlined in the above literature -- to what extent security frames were
employed to justify, conceptualise, and operationalise these two global
health initiatives which remain, successfully, in place today. Second,
once accepting the premise that securitisation is deliberately engaged
the two documents were analysed to identify a set of 'benchmarks' to
guide its assessment of the extent to which a health initiative has
aligned with security. Both documents were examined in detail for the
presence of 'speech acts' (Hansen 2012) -- the initiative itself or
actors associated with the initiative identified an existential threat
or risk and speech acts that called for the adoption of extraordinary
measures. Was the initiative itself referred to as 'security', 'threat',
or 'risk'. Who was the 'referent object' identified -- the group
threatened; who was the functional actor capable of protecting the
referent object from the identified threat (Buzan et al. 1998: 26--39);
and what was the 'scale' of securitisation utitlised to emphasise the
need for extraordinary measures (Buzan and Weaver 2009). Third,
discourse analysis (Hansen 2012). In this case, the discourse within the
two documents were analysed using NVivo Software. For the purposes of
this chapter, I refer to three query searches conducted to analyse the
perspectives being presented in the two documents concerning the threat
the initiative is addressing, who the initiative is 'protecting' and 262
S.E. DAVIES who is responsible for such protection. To facilitate
answering these three levels of inquiry, three query searches within
NVivo of each document were conducted: (1) word frequency analysis, (2)
text search of 'security' terms and, and (3) text search of 'other'
normative terms (development, rights, economy). A word tree was then
developed for the second and third text searches with a 'in context'
search up to ten surrounding words (on either side) to enable
understanding of the context and usage of the key words, i.e. 'threat'
or 'poor' being searched in the document. The word frequency search
assisted with identifying the primary actors discussed in the documents
-- i.e. who was identified as the referent actor intended for that
initiative versus the functional actor necessary to give effect to the
initiative. Findings Discourse analysis of the TFI and GAVI documents
produced three key findings. The first, unexpected, find was that the
TFI initiative was framed just as much in security terms as was GAVI.
The number of securitisation 'speech acts' (Hansen 2012) searched and
located in the Framework Convention was practically the same at GAVI --
0.08% and 0.07%, respectively (speech act terms: secure, threat, risk,
mission, extraordinary, urgent). In both cases, the presence of security
language was less than 1% of each document. What was significant was
that in the search for 'other' normative terms (terms: responsible,
rights, develop, needs, poor) -- the Framework Convention was
comparatively high at 1.05%, and a similar search for GAVI came at 0.4%
references. However, given the Framework Convention is a legal document
the presence of 'right/rights' partly accounts for high percentage
compared to GAVI. Contextual analysis of these terms reveals further
detail in how the documents framed the problem, the referent actor and
the functional actor (see Table 14.1). In the Framework Convention --
despite higher use of 'other' (nonsecurity) normative language than GAVI
-- there is a clear disposition towards identifying the state as the
'functional' actor responsible for taking measures necessary to protect
the population from tobacco sale, use, and morbidity. The Convention
directly refers to populations at risk (women and minors) and the need
for member states to support civil society capacity to inform and
educate tobacco awareness in these populations. Again, this is a legal
instrument so the emphasis on member states is not surprising as they
are the only signatories. However, even in 'other normative' references
to rights, responsibilities and need -- primary emphasis remains on the
state as the functional actor protects the population at risk of
addiction rather than alternative dominant frames such as the right to
health, the right to information. The Framework Convention leans towards
more 'traditional' security language in conceptualising the
state--individual relationship concerning tobacco control: risk and risk
mitigation; threat and protection. In the case of GAVI, the 0.07%
security references in contrast with its 0.4% 'other' references hints
at a different frame being brought to this initiative. However, it is
not particularly clear until, again, the broader context of these terms
is analysed. In the case of GAVI the focus is overwhelming on the
'mission' of the alliance and ensuring institutional clarity to support
the primary focus -- the right of the child to immunisation. This is
clearly stated as seen above, particularly in the mission and
responsibility statements (Table 14.1). The only time the roles of
functional actors are associated with either security or other terms are
in the context of securing commitment from actors (broad range of board
membership from states to international organisations, pharmaceutical
companies, and civil society), and development of health sector
capacity. Despite GAVI addressing the containment of infectious disease,
there is no threat language present. Securitised speech acts are
practically absent -- even when 'security' terms are located. The
emphasis is overwhelming on rights and alleviating deprivation. Both
initiatives confound the expectations prior to analysis -- the
infectious disease focused initiative is 'under-securitised' in
comparison to the non-communicable focused initiative. Finally, hinted
at above, the emphasis on primary actors in these two documents revealed
key similarities -- both focus on the institutional arrangements and the
actors most closely associated with these arrangements. In the case of
GAVI the board (comprised of international organisation, civil society,
member states, pharmaceutical, and philanthropic members) is the primary
functional actor; in the case of the TFI, the actor that looms largest
is the organisation (namely, WHO) followed by signatory states to the
Convention. Discussion about the population who are to benefit and
arguably be empowered from these initiatives, is not discussed as much
as the organisation and accordingly the implementation arrangements
around the initiative itself. To some extent, given the nature of these
two documents, this is not surprising. However, its presence in two
documents for two very different initiatives may reveal that the
pathology of organisations rather than the framing of an initiative
requires further study when engaging with the comparative success and
failure of global health diplomacy (Barnett and Finnemore 2003;
Hanrieder 2015). 14 ADVOCATING GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY 265 CONCLUSION
What is the value of securitisation when it comes to building and
sustaining global political interest in health issues? Some contend that
[global health security has not run its course and continues to have
utility in building state interest, particularly the resources of
foreign affairs and defence departments, to secure global health
diplomacy objectives]{.underline} (Kickbusch et al. 2007; Feldbaum et
al. 2010; Elbe 2011). Others contend it is a 'smokescreen' that captures
short bursts of attention that are episodic and may have immediate
impact but no essential 'follow through' (McInnes and Rushton 2013). In
this chapter, I explored how global health initiatives securitise and
what becomes of them. I deliberately chose two successful initiatives
with the expectation that one had securitised a conventional health
issue -- vaccine preventable infectious diseases -- and one had not --
tobacco regulation. In examining the cases of TFI and GAVI, I looked at
their core document: their mission and value statements reflected in,
respectively, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the first
meeting documents of GAVI. Speech acts, identified as the hallmark of
securitising moves, were analysed in both documents and contrasted with
'non-securitisation' or 'other normative' language. The Framework
Convention engaged in more securitising language or 'speech acts'
compared to GAVI but both contained more references to human rights and
responsibilities discourse. In neither case did it appear as if actors
had taken a conscious decision to securitise the issue any more than
they chose to articulate the issue in terms of human rights obligations.
In the case of the Framework Convention [[where]{.mark} a [focus on
security was]{.mark} expected and to a greater extent [seen]{.mark} here
[was an **equal**]{.mark}**ly strong [presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline} **[human rights and 'sovereignty as responsibility'
language]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The [security discourse]{.mark} may
have **[helped capture attention]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[but]{.mark} it
[was **not the only** ]{.mark}**discursive [tool at
play]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and neither did it]{.underline}]{.mark}
obviously **[[displace other discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the
case of GAVI, the initiative identified its primary mission as
fulfilling the rights of the child; whereas for TFI, emphasis was member
states fulfilling their responsibility to address the threat of tobacco
related illness from tobacco usage. GAVI appears to have a single
referent -- the right of the child to health via immunisation; while TFI
related to a multitude of actors. [[The **operationalisation**
of]{.mark} the [initiative(s)]{.mark} and their embeddedness in global
health architecture [dominated]{.mark} the
[discussion]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[far more than]{.mark} the [framing
language]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Framing language constituted
[a]{.mark} relatively [small part of]{.mark} the [discourse compared to
the consuming discussion of **institutional
design**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [What this comparison of two global
health initiatives reveals is that whilst security discourse might help
**capture**]{.underline} the **[attention]{.underline}** of states, [it
has]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[overtaken other
policy frames]{.underline}** such as human rights and 'sovereignty as
responsibility language'. [Indeed, [the key priority seems to be]{.mark}
not whether the [international]{.mark} community should be engaged with
these issues, but the appropriate **institutional design for

4 Discussion and conclusion

[There are dozens of **emerging**]{.underline} and new
[**tech**nologies]{.underline} and innovations that are to come in the
foreseeable future. [However, it is hard to imagine them now, especially
the all possibilities of their convergence. Due to the uncertainty and
because "all technologies are inherently prone to potential misuse
and]{.underline} \[...\] [the necessary **regulations usually lag**
behind the technologies]{.underline}" \[1\], [**fears** among the public
can arise. This is **nothing new**, but the **recent research** is
relatively **scarce**]{.underline} and sometimes art (literature, film)
is better in portraying the fears or the security threats generated by
technological change, that are perceived.

[The reviewed **[academic lit]{.mark}**erature [identifies]{.mark} some
**[tech]{.mark}nological [threats]{.mark}** that are relatively likely
and (will be) intensive [such as **cyber**]{.mark}-attacks,
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} robotics, and
[**[biotech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}. In the Czech political
discourse, [[we identified]{.mark} especially the [securitization of
robotics]{.mark} and automation]{.underline}, particularly [[in relation
to the auto]{.mark}motive [industry]{.mark}]{.underline} that produces a
substantial part of the country's GDP. [There are fears that they will
lead to loss of employment]{.underline} and ensuing social and economic
instability. [Specialized national agencies and official documents also
often mention cyber-threats]{.underline}. [[**But** the rest]{.mark} of
all the possible concerns and threats [is **entirely
absent**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Czech narrative.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech public only repeats the [**[fears verbalized
in politics]{.mark} and policies**, [but even those **securitization
moves** are **not**]{.mark} **very [successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The biggest threat perceived at the beginning of 2019 was water scarcity
and then other mainstream fears such as terrorism or migration.
Therefore, [[we]{.mark} can **[confirm]{.mark}**]{.underline} Hauptman's
observation that ["[the **public** is]{.mark} rather **[badly
informed]{.mark}** about dangers of new technologies [and]{.mark} that
[**governments** tend to **underestimate**]{.mark} the potential
[threats]{.mark}"]{.underline} \[1\].

Czech politicians and experts should accept the fact that, apart from
the hope of solutions of the problems we face, new technologies can
become security threats through having unintended consequences or being
misused. They should also expect that the public fears do not
necessarily have to reflect the "objective" existence, intensity, or
nature of threats, but they can be "only" perceived or imagined and,
thus, still have unsettling social and economic effects. Politicians and
experts should intensify the public discussion in order to become better
at managing technological change and to avoid the previously mentioned
issues. There is also potential for further research in the Czech
context, concretely to learn if and how Czech scientists, researchers,
and experts see technological change and innovation as technology
threats and which solutions they suggest.

#### Securitizing environmental destruction spurs pro-social responses -- NOT militarization

Environmental Apocalypse: How Imagining the End Facilitates Moral
Reasoning Among Environmental Activists," Ethics and the Environment,

Environmental Apocalypticism and Activism As we saw in the introduction,
critics often argue that apocalyptic rhetoric induces feelings of
hopelessness or fatalism. While it certainly does for some people, in
this section I will present evidence that [apocalypticism]{.underline}
also [often goes hand in hand with activism]{.underline}. Some of the
strongest evidence of a connection between environmental apocalypticism
and activism comes from a national survey that examined whether
Americans perceived climate change to be dangerous. As part of his
analysis, Anthony Leiserowitz identified several "interpretive
communities," which had consistent demographic characteristics but
varied in their levels of risk perception. [The group who perceived the
risk to be the greatest]{.underline}, which he labeled "alarmists,"
[described climate change]{.underline} \[End Page 5\] [using apocalyptic
language, such as]{.underline} "Bad...bad...bad...like [after nuclear
war...no vegetation]{.underline}," "Heat waves, it's gonna kill the
world," [and "Death of the planet]{.underline}" (2005, 1440). Given such
language, this would seem to be a reasonable way to operationalize
environmental apocalypticism. [[If]{.mark} such [apocalypticism
encouraged fatalism]{.mark}, we would [expect alarmists to be less
likely]{.mark} to have engaged in environmental behavior]{.underline}
compared to groups with moderate or low levels of concern. [[To the
contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [Leiserowitz found that
alarmists "were [significantly more likely to have taken personal
action]{.mark} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}" (ibid.)
[than respondents who perceived climate change to pose less of a
threat]{.underline}. Interestingly, while one might expect such radical
views to appeal only to a tiny minority, Leiserowitz found that [a
respectable eleven percent of Americans fell into this
group]{.underline} (ibid). Further supporting Leiserowitz's findings,
[in a separate national survey]{.underline} conducted in 2008, Maibach,
Roser-Renouf, and Leiserowitz found that [a group]{.underline} they
[labeled "the Alarmed]{.underline}" (again, due to their high levels of
concern about climate change) "[are]{.underline} the segment [most
engaged in the issue of global warming. They are very convinced it is
happening, human-caused, and a serious and urgent threat. The Alarmed
are already making changes in their own lives and support an aggressive
national response]{.underline}" (2009, 3, emphasis added). [This group
was far more likely than people with lower levels of concern over
climate change to have engaged in consumer activism]{.underline} (by
rewarding companies that support action to reduce global warming with
their business, for example) or to have contacted elected officials to
express their concern. Additionally, the authors found that ["\[w\]hen
asked which reason for action was most important]{.underline} to them
personally, [the Alarmed were most likely to select preventing the
destruction of most life on the planet]{.underline} (31%)" (2009,
31)---a finding suggesting that for many in this group [[it is
specifically the desire to avert catastrophe]{.mark}, rather than some
other motivation, [that encourages pro-environmental
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taken together, these and other studies
(cf. Semenza et al. 2008 and DerKarabetia, Stephenson, and Poggi 1996)
provide important evidence that [many of those who think environmental
problems pose a severe threat practice some form of activism, [rather
than giving way to fatalistic resignation]{.mark}]{.underline}. National
surveys give a good overview of the association between apocalypticism
and activism among the general public, but they do not \[End Page 6\]
provide sufficient ethnographic detail. To complement this broader
picture I now turn to case studies, which provide greater insight into
how adherents themselves understand what motivates their environmental
behavior. When seeking a subset of environmentalists with apocalyptic
beliefs, the radical wing is an obvious place to look. For example, many
Earth First!ers believe that the collapse of industrial society is
inevitable (Taylor 1994). At the same time, the majority are actively
committed to preventing ecological disaster. As Earth First! co-founder
Howie Wolke acknowledged, the two are directly connected: "As ecological
calamity unravels the living fabric of the Earth, environmental
radicalism has become both common and necessary" (1989, 29).3 This logic
underlies efforts to preserve wilderness areas, which many radical
environmentalists believe will serve as reservoirs of genetic diversity,
helping to restore the planet after industrial society collapses (Taylor
1994). [In addition to encouraging activism to preserve wilderness,
apocalyptic beliefs also motivate]{.underline} practices such as
"monkeywrenching," or ecological sabotage, civil disobedience, and the
more conventional "[paper monkeywrenching" (lobbying, engaging in public
information campaigns to shift legislative priorities]{.underline}, or
using lawsuits when these tactics fail). Ultimately, while there are
disagreements over what strategies will best achieve their desired
goals, for most radical environmentalists, apocalypticism and activism
are bound closely together. The connection between belief in impending
disaster and environmental activism holds true for Wiccans as well.
During fieldwork in the southeastern United States, for example, Shawn
Arthur reported meeting "dozens of Wiccans who professed their
apocalyptic millenarian beliefs to anyone who expressed interest, yet
many others only quietly agreed with them without any further
elaboration" (2008, 201). For this group, the coming disaster was
understood as divine retribution, the result of an angry Earth Goddess
preparing to punish humans for squandering her ecological gifts (Arthur
2008, 203). In light of Gaia's impending revenge, Arthur found that
Wiccans advocated both spiritual and material forms of activism. For
example, practices such as Goddess worship, the use of herbal remedies
for healing, and awareness of the body and its energies were considered
important for initiating a more harmonious relationship with the earth
(Arthur 2008, 207). As for material activism, Arthur notes \[End Page
7\] that the notion of environmental apocalypse played a key role in
encouraging pro-environmental behavior: images of immanent \[sic\]
ecological crisis and apocalyptic change often were utilized as
motivating factors for developing an environmentally and ecologically
conscious worldview; for stressing the importance of working for the
Earth through a variety of practices, including environmental activism,
garbage collecting, recycling, composting, and religious rituals; for
learning sustainable living skills; and for developing a special
relationship with the world as a divine entity. (2008, 212) What these
studies and my own experiences in the environmentalist milieu4 suggest
is that [people who make a serious commitment to engaging in
environmentally friendly behavior, [people who move beyond making
superficial changes to making substantial and permanent ones, are quite
likely to subscribe to]{.mark} some form of [the apocalyptic
narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}. All this is not to say that
apocalypticism directly or inevitably causes activism, or that believing
catastrophe is imminent is the only reason people become activists.
However, it is to say that [activism and apocalypticism are
associated]{.underline} for some people, [and]{.underline} that [this
association is not arbitrary]{.underline}, for [there is something
uniquely powerful and compelling about the apocalyptic
narrative]{.underline}. Plenty of people will hear it and ignore it, or
find it implausible, or simply decide that if the situation really is so
dire there is nothing they can do to prevent it from continuing to
deteriorate. Yet [to focus only on the ability of apocalyptic rhetoric
to induce apathy, indifference or reactance is to ignore the evidence
that it also fuels quite the opposite]{.underline}---grave concern,
activism, and sometimes even outrage. It is also to ignore the
movement's history. From Silent Spring (Carson \[1962\] 2002) to The
Limits to Growth (Meadows et al 1972) to The End of Nature (McKibben
1989), apocalyptic arguments have held a prominent place within
environmental literature, topping best-seller lists and spreading the
message far and wide that protecting the environment should be a
societal priority. Thus, while it is not a style of argument that will
be effective in convincing everyone to commit to the environmental cause
(see Feinberg and Willer 2011), there does appear to be a close
relationship between apocalyptic belief and activism among a certain
minority. The next section explores the implications of that
relationship further. \[End Page 8\] The Apocalyptic Narrative as a
Framework for Moral Deliberation In discussing how apocalypticism
functions within the environmental community, it will be helpful to
analyze it as a type of narrative. I do so because the domain of
narrative includes both the stories that people read and write, as well
as those they tell and live by. By using narratives as data, scholars
can analyze experiential and textual sources simultaneously
(Polkinghorne 1988; Riessman 2000). To analyze environmental
apocalypticism as a type of narrative is not to suggest that
apocalyptics' claims about the future are fictional. Rather, it is to
highlight that the facts to which [environmentalists appeal have been
organized with particular goals in mind]{.underline}, goals which have
necessarily shaped the selection and presentation of those facts.
[Compelling environmental writers do not simply list every known fact
pertaining to the natural world, but instead select certain findings and
place them within a larger interpretive framework. Alone, each fact has
little meaning, but when woven into a larger narrative, a message
emerges. This process of narrativization is essential if a message is to
be persuasive]{.underline} (Killingsworth and Palmer 2000, 197), and has
occurred not only in the rapidly expanding genre of environmental
nonfiction, but in much scientific writing about the environment as well
(Harré, Brockmeier, and Mühlhäusler 1999, 69). [What defines narratives
as such is their beginning-middle-end structure]{.underline}, their
ability to "describe an action that begins, continues over a
well-defined period of time, and finally draws to a definite close"
(Cronon 1992, 1367). Here I will focus on the last of these elements,
the ending, because anything we can learn about how endings function
within narratives in general will be applicable to the apocalypse, the
most final ending of all. An ending is essential in order for a story to
be complete, but there is more to it than this. Endings are also key
because they establish a story's moral, the lesson it is supposed to
impart upon the reader. In other words, to know the moral of the story,
auditors must know the consequences of the actions depicted therein, so
there can be no moral without an ending. To take a simple example, when
we hear the story of the shepherd boy who falsely claims that a wolf is
attacking his flock of sheep in order to entertain himself at his
community's expense, what makes the lesson clear is that when a wolf
does attack his flock, the disenchanted town members refuse to come to
his aid. By clearly illustrating how telling lies can have \[End Page
9\] unpleasant consequences for the perpetrator, the ending reveals the
moral that lying is wrong. As Cronon explains, it is "\[t\]he difference
between beginning and end \[that\] gives us our chance to extract a
moral from the rhetorical landscape" (1992, 1370). Endings play a
similar role in environmental stories. In Al Gore's book Earth in the
Balance (1992), for example, he devotes over a third of the book's pages
to presenting scientific evidence that disaster is imminent.5 As he sums
it up, "Modern industrial civilization...is colliding violently with our
planet's ecological system. The ferocity of its assault on the earth is
breathtaking, and the horrific consequences are occurring so quickly as
to defy our capacity to recognize them" (1992, 269). He builds this
argument so carefully precisely because if the ending does not seem
credible, the moral he wants readers to draw from the story will not be
compelling. [If]{.underline} his [readers are not convinced that the
ending to this story of ecological misbehavior will be a debacle of
colossal proportions, they will not become convinced that they need to
dramatically alter their ecological behavior]{.underline}. Thus the
vision of future catastrophe that Gore presents provides a crucial
vantage point from which the present environmental situation can be
understood as the result of a grand moral failure, and Gore's readers
are made aware of their obligations in light of it. Gore himself
appreciates the importance of this recognition, arguing that "whether we
realize it or not, we are now engaged in an epic battle to right the
balance of our earth, and the tide of this battle will turn only when
the majority of people in the world become sufficiently aroused by a
shared sense of urgent danger to join an all-out effort" (1992, 269,
emphasis added). Here, as in so many other stories, the ending must be
in place for the moral to become clear. To say that endings are
essential in order for stories to have morals is already to hint that
[stories alter behavior,]{.underline} that [they can encourage action in
the real world even as they invoke an imaginary one]{.underline}. This
much is clear from Earth in the Balance (1992): Gore does not just want
people to grasp a moral, to perceive some ethic in the abstract---he
wants them change their behavior in the here and now. In constructing a
narrative with this goal in mind, he is banking on the ability of
powerful stories to motivate social change, to be, as Cronon puts it,
"our chief moral compass in the world" (1992, 1375). Mark Johnson's
insightful synthesis of cognitive science and philosophy helps explain
further how this process of moral guidance occurs. For \[End Page 10\]
Johnson, narrative is fundamental to our experience of reality, "the
most comprehensive means we have for constructing temporal syntheses
that bind together and unify our past, present, and future into more or
less meaningful patterns" (1993, 174). [Narratives are also critical to
our ability to reason morally, an activity which]{.underline} Johnson
asserts [is fundamentally imaginative]{.underline}. In this view, [we
use stories to imagine ourselves in different scenarios, exploring and
evaluating the consequences of different possible actions in order to
determine the right one]{.underline}. Moral deliberation is thus ...an
imaginative exploration of the possibilities for constructive action
within a present situation. [We have a problem to solve here and
now]{.underline} (e.g., 'What am I to do?'.... 'How should I treat
others?'), [and we must try out various possible continuations of our
narrative in search of the one that seems best to resolve the
indeterminacy of our present situation]{.underline}. (1993, 180) Put
another way, what cognitive science has revealed is that [from an
empirical perspective the process of moral deliberation entails
constructing narratives rooted in our unique history and circumstances,
rather than applying universal principles]{.underline} (such as Kant's
categorical imperative) [to particular cases. That we use narratives to
reason morally is not a result of conscious choice but of how human
cognition works]{.underline}. That is, insofar as we experience
ourselves as temporal beings, a narrative framework is necessary to
organize, explain, and ultimately justify the many individual decisions
that over time become a life. Formal principles may be useful in
unambiguous textbook cases, but in real life "we can almost never decide
(reflectively) how to act without considering the ways in which we can
continue our narrative construction of our situation" (Johnson 1993,
160). Empirically speaking, "our moral reasoning is situated within our
narrative understanding" (Johnson 1993, 180, italics in original). The
observation that people use narratives to reason morally may help
explain the association between environmental apocalypticism and
activism. [The function of the [apocalyptic narrative]{.mark} may be
that it [helps]{.mark} adherents [determine how to act]{.mark} by
providing a storyline from which they can imaginatively sample, enabling
them to assess the consequences of their actions]{.underline}. In order
to answer the question, "Should I drive or walk to the store?" for
example, they can reason, "If I walk, that will reduce my carbon
footprint, which will help keep the ice caps from melting, saving humans
and other species." It is their [access to this narrative of
impending]{.underline} \[End Page 11\] [disaster]{.underline} that
[makes such reasoning possible, for it provides a simple framework
within which people can consider and eventually arrive at some
conclusion about their moral obligations]{.underline}.6 More broadly, it
can guide entire lives by providing a narrative frame of reference that
imbues the individual's experiences with meaning. For example, it is the
context of looming anthropogenic apocalypse which suggests that
dedicating one's life to achieving a healthier relationship with the
natural world is a worthwhile endeavor. [Absent the apocalypse, choices
such as limiting one's travel to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}, becoming vegetarian, working in the
environmental sector (often for less compensation), or growing one's own
food [could seem to be meaningless sacrifices]{.underline}. Within this
context, on the other hand, such choices become essential features of
the quest to live a moral life. [The apocalyptic narrative]{.underline}
is but one of many ways to tell the environmental story, yet it is one
that [seems particularly well-suited to encouraging pro-environmental
behavior]{.underline}. First, [the apocalyptic ending discloses certain
everyday decisions as moral decisions. [Without the narrative context of
impending disaster, decisions]{.mark} such as whether to drive or walk
to the store [would be merely matters of convenience]{.mark} or
preference]{.underline}. In the context of potentially disastrous
consequences for valued places, people, and organisms, by contrast, such
decisions become matters of right and wrong. Second, [[putting
info]{.mark}rmation about the environment [into narrative form enables
apocalyptics to link]{.mark} complex [global environmental processes to
their own lives]{.mark}]{.underline}, a perceptual technique Thomashow
describes as "bringing the biosphere home" (2002). Developing this skill
is essential because [[without that]{.mark} felt sense of
[connection]{.mark} to their own lived experience, [people are much less
likely to]{.mark} become convinced that it is incumbent upon them to
[act]{.mark}]{.underline} (2002, 2). Finally, the sheer magnitude of the
impending disaster increases the feeling of responsibility to make good
on one's moral intuitions. By locating individuals within a drama of
ultimate concern, the narrative frames their choices as cosmically
important, and this feeling of urgency then helps to convert moral
deliberation into action. With this conceptual overview in place, we can
now examine more closely what the relationship between apocalypticism
and moral reasoning looks like in practice. \[End Page 12\]

It is no longer a question that [human interaction with the world is

[Nevertheless]{.underline}, within [academic communities]{.underline}
people [are divided over which discursive tactic]{.underline},
[ontological position, or strategy for activism should be
adopted]{.underline}. I contend that regardless of an ecocritic's
particular orientation that [ecocriticism **most effectively produces
change** when it **doesn't neglect**]{.underline} the **[tangible
reality]{.underline}** that surrounds any discussion of the environment.
[This **demands including human-induced ecocidal violence** within all
our accounts]{.underline}. **[[Retreating from images of ecological
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}** to speak purely within inner-­‐academic
or policymaking circles [**[isolates our conversations]{.mark}** away
from the rest of the world---as it dies before our eyes]{.underline}.¶
This is [not to argue that interrogating people's discourse, tactics,
ontological orientation, or anything else lacks merit]{.underline}.
Timothy Luke, Chair and Distinguished Professor of Political Science at
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, explains that¶ Because nothing in
Nature simply is given within society, such terms must be assigned
significance by every social group that mobilizes them\[.\] \... Many
styles of ecologically grounded criticism circulate in present-­‐day
American mass culture, partisan debate, consumer society, academic
discourse, and electoral politics as episodes of ecocritique, contesting
our politics of nature, economy, and culture in the contemporary global
system of capitalist production and consumption. (1997: xi)¶ Luke
reminds us that regardless of how ecocritics advance their agenda they
always impact our environmental awareness and therefore alter our
surrounding ecology. In doing so he shows that both literal governmental
policies and the symbolic universe they take place within reconstruct
the discourses utilized to justify policy and criticism in the first
place. This is why films like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 can put
forth realistic depictions of government response to environmental
apocalypse. And despite being fictional, these films in turn can
influence the reality of governmental policy. Even the science-­‐fiction
of weather-­‐controlling weapons are now only steps away from becoming
reality2.¶ [Oftentimes [it takes images of **planetary annihilation** to
**motivate people** into action]{.mark} after years of sitting idly by
watching things slowly decay]{.underline}. In reality [it takes
awareness of impending disaster [to **compel policymakers**]{.mark} to
en**act**]{.underline} even piecemeal [reform]{.underline}. On the
screen [it takes the **actual appearance** of ecological apocalypse to
**set the plot in motion**]{.underline}. What is constant is that "as
these debates unfold, visions of what is the good or bad life \... find
many of their most compelling articulations as ecocritiques \... \[that
are\] [mobilized for and against various projects of power and economy
in the organization of]{.underline} our [everyday
existence]{.underline}" (Luke 1997: xi). [We **cannot motivate people**
to **change the ecological conditions** that give rise to **thoughts of
theorization** without reference to the **concrete environmental
destruction** ongoing in reality. This means that, **[even when]{.mark}
our [images of apocalypse aren't]{.mark} fully [accurate]{.mark}**, our
[use of]{.mark} elements of [**scientifically-established reality**
reconstructs]{.mark} the surrounding [power structures in beneficial
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. When we ignore either ecological metaphors or
environmental reality we only get part of the picture.\`¶ [In recent
years]{.underline}, many [ecocritics have shied away from]{.underline}
the very [metaphors that compel a sense of urgency.]{.underline} They
have largely done so [out of the [**fear** that]{.mark} its [deployment
will get **co-opted by hegemonic institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Such critics [ignore how what we advocate **alters our understanding of
ourselves**]{.mark} to the surrounding ecology]{.underline}. In doing
so, [our advocacies [render]{.mark} such [co-optation **meaningless**
because of the possibility to **redeploy**]{.mark} **our
[metaphors]{.mark} in the future**]{.underline}. In the upcoming
sections, I will provide an overview of how poststructuralist thinkers
like Michel Foucault and Martin Heidegger influence some ecocritics to
retreat from omnicidal rhetoric. This retreat minimizes the main
objectives of their ecocriticism. I argue that [[rather than withdrawing
from images of apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we should
**utilize them**]{.mark} **in subversive ways** [to]{.mark} disrupt the
current relationship people have to their ecology]{.underline}.
Professor of Sociology at York University, Fuyuki Kurasawa argues that
"[instead of bemoaning]{.underline} the contemporary preeminence of a
[dystopian imaginary]{.underline} \... [it can [enable]{.mark} a novel
form of **[transnational socio-political action]{.mark}** \... that can
be termed **[preventive foresight]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \... [\[I\]t
is a mode of ethico-political practice enacted by participants in the
emerging realm of global civil society \... \[by\] putting into practice
a sense of responsibility for the future by attempting to prevent global

(Tim, "Exeunt Omnes? Survival, Pessimism and Time in the Work of John H.
Herz," Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 46, No. 3, pp.
283-302, dml) \[ableist language modifications denoted by brackets\]

Herz explicitly combined, therefore, a political realism with an ethical
idealism, resulting in what he termed a 'survival ethic'.65 This was
applicable to all humankind and its propagation relied on the generation
of what he termed 'world-consciousness'.66 Herz's [implicit recognition
of an **open** yet **linear temporality** allowed him to
**[imagine]{.mark} possible [futures]{.mark}** aligned [with]{.mark} the
[survival]{.mark} ethic, [whilst]{.mark} **at the same time [imagining
futures]{.mark} in [which humans become extinct]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
His [**pessimism** about the latter **did not preclude** working towards
the former.]{.underline} As Herz recognised, [it was one thing to
develop an ethics of survival but quite another to **translate theory
into practice**. What was [required]{.mark} was a **collective**,
**transnational** and **inherently [interdisciplinary effort]{.mark}**
[to address]{.mark} **nuclear**]{.underline} and environmental
[**issues** and to problematize notions of security]{.underline},
sustainability and survival [in the context of **[nuclear
geopolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the technological transformation
of society. Herz proposed various practical ways in which young people
in particular could become involved in this project. One idea floated in
the 1980s, which would alarm many in today's more cosmopolitan and
culturally-sensitive IR, was for a Peace Corps-style 'peace and
development service', which would 'crusade' to provide 'something
beneficial for people living under unspeakably sordid conditions' in the
'Third World'.67 He expended most of his energy, however, from the 1980s
onwards, in thinking about and formulating 'a new subdiscipline of the
social sciences', which he called 'Survival Research'.68 Informed by the
survival ethic outlined above, and within the overarching framework of
his realist liberal internationalism, Survival Research emerged as
Herz's solution to the shortcomings of academic research, public
education and policy development in the face of global catastrophe.69 It
was also Herz's plea to scholars to venture beyond the ivory tower and
become -- excusing the gendered language of the time -- 'homme engagé,
if not homme révolté'.70 His proposals for Survival Research were far
from systematic but they reiterated his life-long concerns with nuclear
and environmental issues, and with the necessity to act in the face of
threats to human survival. [The **principal responsibilities**
of]{.underline} survival [**[researchers]{.mark}** were two-fold. One,
to [**raise awareness** of survival]{.mark} issues in the minds of
[**policy-makers** and]{.mark} the **[public]{.mark}**, and to
**demonstrate the [link]{.mark} between political [inaction]{.mark}
now** [and]{.mark} its effect on **subsequent human [survival]{.mark}**.
Two, to **suggest** and **shape [new attitudes]{.mark}** more
'appropriate to the solution of new and unfamiliar survival problems',
[rather than]{.mark} **relying on [ingrained modes]{.mark} of thought**
and **practice**]{.underline}.71 The primary initial purpose, therefore,
of Survival Research would be to identify scientific, sociocultural and
political problems bearing on the possibilities of survival, and to
begin to develop ways of overcoming these. This was, admittedly,
non-specific and somewhat vague, but the central thrust of his proposal
was clear: ['In our age of global survival concerns, it should be the
**primary responsibility of scholars** to engage in survival
issues']{.underline}.72 Herz considered **[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
essential disciplinary contributor to this endeavour, one that should be
promiscuous across the social and natural sciences. It [**[should not be
afraid to think the worst]{.mark}**, if the worst is at all possible,
and to **[establish the various requirements]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
social, economic, political -- [[of 'a **livable
world**']{.mark}.]{.underline}73 How this long-term project would
translate into global policy is not specified but, consistent with his
previous work, Herz identified the need for shifts in attitudes to and
awareness of global problems and solutions. Only then would it be
possible for 'a turn round that demands leadership to persuade millions
to change lifestyles and make the sacrifices needed for survival'.74
Productive pessimism and temporality In 1976, shortly before he began
compiling the ideas that would become Survival Research, Herz wrote: For
the first time, we are compelled to take the futuristic view if we want
to make sure that there will be future generations at all. Acceleration
of developments in the decisive areas (demographic, ecological,
strategic) has become so strong that even the egotism of après nous le
déluge might not work because the déluge may well overtake ourselves,
the living.75 [Of significance here is **[not]{.mark} the appeal to
[futurism]{.mark} per se**]{.underline}, although this is important,
[but the suggestion this is 'the **first time**' futurism is **necessary
to ensuring human survival**. This is]{.underline} Herz the realist
declaring a break with conventional realism: Herz is [**not bound to a
cyclical vision** of political or historical time in which events and
processes reoccur over and again]{.underline}. His [identification of
nuclear weapons]{.underline} as an 'absolute novum' in international
politics [demonstrates this belief in the **non-cyclical nature of
humankind's unfolding temporality**]{.underline}.76 As Sylvest observes
of Herz's attitude to the nuclear revolution, ['the horizons of meaning
it produced installed a **temporal break** with the past, and
simultaneously carried a **promise for the future**']{.underline}.77
[This 'promise for the future' was **[not]{.mark}**, however, a
**[simple liberal]{.mark} view** of a **better future consonant with
human [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. His autobiography is clear that
his [experiences of **Nazism** and the **Holocaust** destroyed all
remnants of any original belief in '**inevitable
progress**']{.underline}.78 His [frustration at scientism, technocratic
deception, and the brutal rationality of twentieth-century killing, all
but **demanded a rejection** of the **liberal dream** and the
**inevitability of its consummation**. If the 'new age' ushered in by
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, he wrote, [is characterised by anything,
it is by its '**indefiniteness of the age** and the **uncertainties of
the future**'; it was **impossible** under these conditions to **draw
firm conclusions** about the future course of international
politics]{.underline}.79 Instead, he recognised the contingency,
precarity and fragility of international politics, and the ghastly
tensions inherent to the structural core of international politics, the
security dilemma.80 Herz was uneasy with [both **cyclical** and
**linear-progressive ways** of perceiving historical time]{.underline}.
The former 'closed' temporalities are endemic to versions of realist IR,
the latter to post-Enlightenment narratives feeding liberal-utopian
visions of international relations and those of Marxism.81 In their own
ways, [each **marginalises** and **diminishes** the contingency of the
social world in and through time, and the **agency of political actors**
in effecting change]{.underline}. Simultaneously, [each **shapes the
futures that may be imagined** and **brought into being**]{.underline}.
Herz recognised this danger. Whilst drawing attention to his own gloomy
disposition, he warns that [without care and attention, 'the
**assumption may determine the event**']{.underline}.82 As a pessimist,
Herz was alert to the hazard of succumbing to negativity, cynicism or
resignation. E.H. Carr recognised this also, in [the difference
between]{.underline} the ['**deterministic pessimism**']{.underline} of
'pure' realism [and]{.underline} those **[realists]{.underline}** 'who
have made their mark on history'; [the latter **may be pessimists** but
they still believe 'human affairs can be **directed** and **modified**
by human action and human thought']{.underline}.83 Herz would share this
anti-deterministic perspective with Carr. Moreover, [the **possibility
of agency** is a product of a temporality 'neither **temporally closed**
nor **deterministic**, neither **cyclical** nor **linear-progressive**;
it is [**rooted in contingency**']{.mark}]{.underline}.84 Again quoting
from his autobiographical account of the impact of Nazism, Herz
described the relationship between his early pessimism and his
developing intellectual stance: The world became a theatre of the
absurd. Suicide would probably have been the logical next move, and I
considered it from time to time. But I was still too young for such a
radical step. One thing, however, emerged: a growing interest in
domestic and, above all, international politics. My complete resignation
was no longer appropriate. If not from within, fascism might perhaps
still be destroyed from without. To my continuing interest in theory,
therefore, was added a practical interest in action.85 Channelling the
spirit of E.H. Carr, he wrote of this 'brutal awakening' to the nature
of power politics in the 1930s that, 'Study could no longer be "pure"
research; it had to become research committed to warn of the deadly
peril and show the way to the necessary action.'86 His commitment to
active engagement was an early one, gestated during his personal
experiences of Nazism in the 1930s.87 This desire to combat Nazism from
the outside was manifest in his activities for the Allies during and
after World War II but it coloured his scholarly life also. Herz
recognised pessimism was a powerful force in his life but, rather than
overcome or mask it, he used it to propel his intellectual project
further, and to engage with, not withdraw from, the world. He was, as
van Munster and Sylvest relate, '\[d\]eeply pessimistic yet a committed
social thinker'.88 Herz was explicit about this: [a **realistic** and
**consistent pessimism** can clarify where we are and prepare us to do
what is necessary]{.underline}.89 [Pessimism is a **necessary
component** of a realistic view of the world, upon which **proper** and
**reasoned action can be founded**]{.underline}. In this sense,
[[pessimism]{.mark} can be **productive**. It [**produces positive
outcomes through action**, rather than **negative ones through
inaction**]{.mark} or **resignation**. These are **subjective
value-judgements**]{.underline}, to be sure, [but are obtained through a
**process of realist engagement with the world**, rather
than]{.underline} blind [\[mere\] **fumbling** or **ideological
railroading**]{.underline}. [Survival]{.underline} Research [was a
**response to**]{.underline} Herz's [**pessimism** about the future,
**not a rejection of it**]{.underline}. This leads us to two
observations about the relevance of pessimism to the study of
international relations. The first is that [pessimism **does not imply
disengagement** from the world]{.underline}. If anything, the example of
John Herz suggests the opposite. He was a pessimist, but his brand of
[[pessimism was no '**passive fatalism**']{.underline}]{.mark}.90 As he
recalled a few years before he died, 'I consider myself a realist who
comes sometimes to pessimistic conclusions, but never gives up looking
for solutions if ever so difficult ones'.91 [Pessimism can be [a **spur
to thought**]{.mark} and to **action** and **need [not be a watchword
for conservatism]{.mark}** in theory or practice]{.underline}.92 This is
not to say being a pessimist is easy. Morgenthau, for his part, 'never
flagged in efforts to use his conceptual skills to help improve the
human condition', despite his [pessimism]{.underline} about the ability
and will of people to take the long view on significant political
issues.93 This [required that scholars **chart different paths** through
troublesome times and [**articulate alternative visions** of
international order, not to **preclude political action** but to
**facilitate it**]{.mark}]{.underline}; not quite the conservative
position realism is often assumed to occupy.94 [In the face of worldly
frustrations and horrors, [it is this **attention to the production of
alternative futures** that prevents 'pessimism from **turning into
fatalism**]{.mark}']{.underline}.95 The second observation is that [it
is **unhelpful and misleading** to treat pessimism and optimism as
**oppositional**]{.underline}.96 Pessimism and optimism are commonly
regarded as antonyms but often enjoy a symbiotic relationship. In Herz,
[they **mingle** and **cross-pollinate** in ways that defy easy
explication]{.underline}. Stirk claims, for instance, that Herz's
[optimism about how the world could be refashioned 'was **never more
than guarded**']{.underline}, restrained by his fierce attachment to the
importance of the security dilemma.97 Puglierin notes that his 'blatant
pessimism' (eklatanter Pessimismus) was always accompanied by some form
of optimism.98 We are reminded of Gramsci's famous statement regarding
'pessimism of intellect, optimism of the will' as the cognitive binary
at work in the political mind.99 [Even as]{.underline} his [pessimism
deepened]{.underline} over the course of his career, he was
**[always]{.underline}** wont to **[end]{.underline}** his [**analyses**
with a '**yet**' or '**in spite of it all**']{.underline}.100
Importantly, as he became more pessimistic, 'the solutions he proposed
became ever more ambitious'.101 His [growing pessimism was accompanied
by increasing resolve to **tackle the problems of the world
head-on**]{.underline}, although, as he admitted in a footnote in the
1980s, 'Not for a moment do I have the illusion that what I have
proposed is likely to happen'.102 A suitably pessimistic aside, perhaps,
but it did not deter him from continuing his project for another twenty
years. [This drive seems not to be rooted in **optimistic conviction**,
nor even a **subtle version of hope**, but in a **properly pessimistic
reading** of the world and its possibilities, engendered as they were by
the **ontological temporality of perpetual change**.]{.underline}

Ethics of Securitization

As discussed in the literature review, [[securitization]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most [often [discussed as a
'**negative'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [concept]{.underline} for several
reasons. First of all, securitization argues that the normal democratic
procedures for decision makers be abandoned in favor of a streamlined
decision-making process handled by a small elite that dictate policy on
security related issues. [Critics assert that securitization
is]{.underline} something largely [inconsistent with the openness and
accountability that]{.underline} [liberal democratic systems
value]{.underline}, [therefore]{.underline} securitization [is something
'negative' to be avoided]{.underline} in societies that place true
importance on these values. [But [what if **the issue**]{.mark} **being
securitized** [is a **direct threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} those very [democratic procedures themselves. Are there
issues [that **deserve to be securitized**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[for the **common good**]{.underline}, [and can government
policies have a **positive impact on society** when these issues are
**securitized?**]{.underline}

[Experts on **disinformation**]{.underline} [warn of the **dire
potential** that such **propaganda** can have on a society]{.underline},
and argue that liberal democracies are especially vulnerable to them.
New technologies have made the 21st century into a completely different
type of information space than its predecessor. [The internet has
decentralized and democratized the flow of information]{.underline} to
the point where somebody sitting on a laptop at home may be able to make
the same impact with a blog as a major newspaper with an article. [With
less institutional control and traditional media gatekeeping on the flow
of information, the internet is a **truly democratic
platform**]{.underline}.148 These democratic processes; freedom of
information, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free
elections; are precisely what make liberal democracies so vulnerable to
disinformation and propaganda. With knowledge of these asymmetric
vulnerabilities[, the Kremlin **consciously aims** "to **take
advantage** of the **free flow of information** in a democratic society,
the **effect of that information on public opinion**, and the
**electoral mechanisms**]{.underline} [through which public opinion
determines a country's leadership]{.underline}."149

[One foundation of a democratic society is the ability to make decisions
in the public forum **based on shared truth**.]{.underline} When voters
go to the polls, they may make a judgement on which candidate or which
proposal they favor based on the information that they have consumed.
Traditionally, they may differ on what course of action may be the best
way to handle a problem, but there is an agreed upon reality that is a
matter of fact; it is shared. [Disinformation, from Russia and other
actors hostile to the West, **promotes falsehoods** to the point where
society **cannot have a shared truth**.]{.underline} Imagine four people
each with a different source of news. One reads the New York Times, one
watches Fox News, one reads Breitbart, and one watches RT. Each one of
these people will not only come to radically different conclusions about
what solutions are best for society, but also about what the basic facts
of reality are in the first place. One person may be out on the streets
protesting the disappearance and rape of a young Russian girl by Muslim
migrants, while the next person may be aware that the story is a
complete falsehood that never happened to begin with. [[Russian
efforts]{.mark} in the EU [show]{.mark} that [these situations **are
not**]{.mark} **a hysterical [fear-mongering]{.mark} reaction to new
technologies**]{.underline} and new sources of information,
[[but]{.mark} that they are **already a [reality]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Disinfo]{.mark}rmation [creates]{.mark} a situation where people can
have **[opposing realities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [because the
information they consume is **so radically different**]{.underline}
[from that of their neighbor.]{.underline} [**[Critical theory]{.mark}**
in international relations **[warns]{.mark}** that
[securitization]{.mark} **[subverts]{.mark} democratic
[decision-making]{.mark} processes**]{.underline}, [[but
**disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation** [**destroys** these]{.mark} very
democratic [processes]{.mark}]{.underline} that are so fundamental for
liberal democratic societies to function the way they are intended. It
is impossible to imagine normal democratic processes solving these types
of problems when those processes are being eroded by propaganda to the
point where Western societies may no longer have normal democratic
processes if this trend continues. In order to maintain these democratic
norms, [securitization may be a **necessary**]{.underline} [process,
even a 'positive' concept that can yield positive results]{.underline}
and protect the democratic values that have propelled the European
project into existence.

From the perspective of states, it is difficult to see why they would
not wish to securitize the issue of Russian disinformation more. States
tend to place an emphasis on matters of physical and territorial
security over all else, which is why issues such as nuclear weapons, or
rising military power in China, or international terrorism are
prioritized in terms of security policy. States' desire for physical
security explains why these issues tend to be some of the most
securitized political issues, with decisions made regarding military
policy in Afghanistan by military panels rather than public referendums.
Walt, arguing from the realist perspective, argues that states "place
particular emphasis on the preservation of the state's territorial
integrity and the physical safety of its inhabitants." 150 Material harm
is of the utmost importance while more ethereal issues, like democratic
procedures, freedom of the information space, and societal resilience
towards propaganda are not prioritized in the same way. Disinformation
has threatened some of the building blocks of democratic societies
throughout the EU, and if these democratic systems fail, it isn't
difficult to imagine that physical security would come under threat as
well. In the case of Spain, the issue of the Spanish government's
territorial sovereignty over Catalonia was attacked by Russian
disinformation, exacerbating the political wounds of the independence
referendum. The disinformation campaign questioned Spain's fundamental
right to exist in its current form, yet Spain did not place the
integrity of their media space as an important security issue despite
this. There needs to be a shift in the importance and value that
European democracies place on the fundamental democratic principles that
allow their system to flourish. They should be prioritized with the same
importance that states place on more traditional measures of power.
Securitization of disinformation with the liberal democratic system and
democratic processes themselves as the referent object, has the
potential to have a more 'positive' outcome than emphasis on hard power,
or immigration, or other issues that contribute to the 'negative'
conception of securitization.

Successful Securitization and Societal Resilience

In the case studies it is clear that [some European countries have
securitized Russian disinformation while some have not.]{.underline}
Namely, the United Kingdom and Lithuania have successfully securitized
disinformation, while Spain, Germany, and the supranational institutions
of the EU have not securitized disinformation. Those that have not
securitized, have identified Russian disinformation as a perceived
security threat and have several securitizing actors currently at play.
The potential audiences of the securitizing speech acts, those within
the security apparatus, NGOs, think-tanks, and even the wider public of
these countries have accepted that Russian disinformation is a security
threat that warrants greater action by their governments. Thus far, they
have not taken measures that could by any means be considered
extraordinary, having allocated a relatively small number of resources
and minimal effort towards combating disinformation, and therefore
cannot be considered to have securitized the issue. These countries, and
the EU, are possibly in the early stages of the process of
securitization, though this does not necessarily mean that they will
complete the process by taking more extraordinary measures against
disinformation. In fact, there could be a reversal and disinformation
could slip back into the realm of normal politics and become
desecuritized.

Some [clear trends emerge in the countries who have **successfully
securitized disinformation**]{.underline}. First[, propaganda narratives
have a **weaker effect on society** when disinformation **has been
securitized**,]{.underline} [**failing to have their desired
impact**]{.underline} and cause major rifts in the public. They also
show that [securitization of disinformation is possible **without**
implicitly **violating** democratic norms of freedom of speech and open
access to information]{.underline}. This becomes clear in looking at the
contrast between Lithuania's countermeasures against disinformation
compared to those of Germany and Spain. In Germany, the Lisa case was
dealt with almost exclusively via the normal criminal and legal
channels, with the police investigation into Lisa's accusations of
kidnap and rape by migrants and police handling of most public
statements related to the controversy. 151 They have begun to enact
minor laws that aim at punishing hate speech and disinformation when
posted on popular social media platforms as well.152 Spanish authorities
have started task forces devoted to alerting the national government
when disinformation narratives start to dominate a story online. 153
Spanish and German officials at the higher levels of national authority
in their respective foreign and defense departments gave minimal
statements regarding the controversies, and have preferred to continue
dealing with Russia through dialogue over more overt confrontation that
could complicate communication. Both Germany and Spain have taken a more
reactive approach to countering disinformation, choosing to deal with it
on a case-by-case basis as an incident unfolds.

Lithuania has taken similar messages to alert national authorities on
dangerous narratives as they develop online, but it has also taken
extraordinary measures that encompass a broader scope. The Lithuanian
government has supported efforts at every level of society; political,
economic, educational, and cultural. 154 Their wide spread programs
focus not only on dealing with each case as it emerges, but also on
strengthening the fundamental resilience of society at the source
through teaching media literacy in secondary schools, funding Russian
language media for the susceptible minority group, and sensitizing the
public to the dangers of propaganda by making disinformation a security
issue linked to the physical security and existence of the state.155
Their bans on Russian media channels during disinformation campaigns,
while possibly construed as violations of a free press, are necessary to
prevent media from spreading out right falsehoods. The news media, both
Lithuanian and Russian language, should be held accountable and has a
responsibility to act as a gatekeeper of the truth. Many media channels
in Lithuania have voluntarily chosen to follow such a route, choosing
not to report on 'fake' news stories that can be detrimental to society
by becoming 'real' news through regurgitation by legitimate media
outlets. It is important not to confuse the right of free speech of an
individual with that of a news organization with ties to a foreign
country, and such acts should not be considered violations of democratic
norms when it comes to protecting the fundamental values of democracy.

[The **countermeasures** taken by a country]{.underline} undoubtedly
[play a role in the **impact** disinformation narratives may have in
that country. With Lithuania's '**successful' securitization** of
disinformation]{.underline}, [**fake stories** and attempts at
**propaganda** have often **fallen on deaf ears**]{.underline}, with
little real success. [Lithuania's overarching, comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation is the **reason** the NATO rape
allegations]{.underline} **[failed to cause a large
disruption]{.underline}** [in the news cycle.]{.underline}156 [This
**strong contrast** is seen with Germany, where the story of a rape by
migrants of a young Russian girl caused an **uproar** and **led to
protests in Berlin**]{.underline} [and a **diplomatic row with
Moscow**]{.underline}. 157 Spain also fell short, with Russian
disinformation exacerbating a contentious independence referendum in
Catalonia and influencing public opinion at home and abroad on the
status of Catalan autonomy. [[Government policies that **fail to
securitize** ]{.mark}**disinformation** and **alert
society**]{.underline} [to the **dangers of propaganda**]{.underline}
[[lead to **false stories** having **explosive
consequences**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Both Spain and Germany's strategies of dealing with disinformation
narratives as they arise is simply not effective enough. The state can
spend time and resources trying to discredit every fake news story that
finds its way to the public forum, but there will always be one to take
its place. It is like fire prevention; a fire alarm can be an important
part of fire prevention, alerting the fire department to come extinguish
a blaze. But there are more important measures as well, such as building
structures with fire resistant materials, or teaching people what to do
in case of a fire. These types of continuous measures, like the policies
Lithuania pursues, make society more resilient and prevent
disinformation from causing a fire in the first place.

[Policies aimed at improving societal resilience towards disinformation
are being utilized in other countries with successful outcomes as
well]{.underline}. Latvia uses a sweeping media literacy program from an
early age to improve critical thinking in its citizens.158 Finland, a
country with a long history of hostility with Russia, uses similar
programs, emphasizing not only the need to publicly correct false
narratives, but also the importance of creating a positive
counternarrative to disinformation that is repeatedly applied to offer
an alternative vision.159 [These countermeasures **only appear** in
countries that have **securitized disinformation**]{.underline}, as
Finland and Latvia have similar histories as Lithuania and treat
disinformation in similar terms, and they are much more promising than
government authorities attempting to play catchup with internet trolls
and false stories.

Internationalization of Countermeasures

Another key conclusion comes from the other [case of successful
securitization in the United Kingdom. The UK, in its **securitization of
disinformation**]{.underline} [following the assassination attempt on
Sergei Skripal, **internationalized the threat**]{.underline} [by
creating a set of countermeasures]{.underline} [that could be
implemented **along with its allies**]{.underline}. The UK successfully
convinced 20 allies to expel Russian diplomats in a coordinated effort
at punishing Putin's regime for the incident and the subsequent
disinformation surrounding it.160 [Theresa May, as a securitizing actor,
not only convinced her public in the UK of disinformation as a security
threat,]{.underline} [but **convinced the international
community**]{.underline} [that such behavior "**threatens the security
of us all**]{.underline}." 161 Compared with the minimal Spanish
attempts at coordinating counter disinformation at the EU level, and
German attempts to keep the Lisa Case under the authority of Berlin's
police department[, British efforts at securitizing their incident by
bringing it to the **attention of the international community** and
launching a **unified response** were **highly
successful.**]{.underline}

This lesson of internationalization should be critical for the EU to
deal with disinformation. [[Securitization needs to take place]{.mark}
not only at the **national level** of member]{.underline} [states, but
also [at the **supranational level**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of
the EU as an institution. The EU itself is under threat of Russian
disinformation just as much as individual member states, with experts
warning of further regionalization of Europe and the EU after Brexit. In
this critical time for the continued existence of the EU, [the threat of
disinformation "[requires]{.mark} new [international instruments]{.mark}
to manage it." 162 Thus far, member states have shown a preference for
taking **individual routes**]{.underline} in order to deal with
disinformation. [The importance **of joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[could be especially important during **elections**]{.underline}, a time
in which the ability of national and EU authorities to cooperate is
critical. During the European elections of 2019 for example, consisting
of four days of simultaneous elections across 28 individual member
states, "the failure of one government to properly mitigate
disinformation efforts threatens the credibility of the entire electoral
process." 163 This problem of coordination cannot be understated, as
some countries do not even have their own systems in place to monitor
disinformation, allowing "local and national actors to spread fake news
more freely" and leaving these countries defenseless against
propaganda.164

[It is essential]{.underline} for the EU [to act as a
**bloc**]{.underline} [and start **joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[counter disinformation]{.underline}**. [Russian
efforts]{.underline}, as shown in the case studies, are not exclusive to
one particular area of Europe, but **[threaten all member
states]{.underline}**. Issues Russia chooses to target; the migrant
crisis, espionage, the use of chemical weapons in a member state, the
solidarity and legitimacy of the NATO, and even the territorial
sovereignty of some countries; should alarm every single member of the
EU. These issues are not unique to one country, but they are issues that
countries even outside of the EU are currently confronting. Europe is
targeted as a bloc, and therefore it should respond as a bloc. Such a
response, as seen in with the UK's diplomatic expulsion, has a larger
impact as a bloc rather than individually. Division will only encourage
more provocations. [Acting on a **unified front** in securitizing
disinformation and reacting with countermeasures will do much more
[to]{.mark} potentially **[deter Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
continuing down the same path in its relations with Europe. The EU needs
to stop hesitating, and start throwing its full weight on the economic,
political, and informational fronts.

'Positive' Securitization

The two [trends discussed in the sections above also show that
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation [can be securitized **without**]{.mark} **wide
[violations of democratic norms]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
**[exclusionary tactics]{.underline}** [towards Russian minorities in
Europe]{.underline}. [By arguing for securitization, this paper is not
arguing that democratic principles should be **thrown out** in favor of
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline} [that subvert the democratic
process]{.underline}, indeed the democratic process is of the utmost
importance because these principles are the referent object of a
European push to securitize disinformation. [And according to
polls]{.underline} in all of the countries involved in the case studies
and the EU as a whole, [the general public agrees that disinformation
**constitutes a security threat**]{.underline} that could be detrimental
to liberal democratic norms. Efforts like media literacy, cooperation
with news organizations, and comprehensive strategies that deal with
disinformation at every level of society are still extraordinary without
necessarily violating democratic norms. These [[policies]{.mark} [aim to
**sensitize the public** ]{.mark}**to
disinformation**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They **do [not]{.mark}** aim
[to]{.mark} **[monitor]{.mark} the public [in a surveillance
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and]{.underline} **[punish
individual views]{.underline}** that are unfavorable to European states.
[On the other hand, these policies are not afraid to prevent large news
outlets from **spreading lies** that harm the ability to make democratic
decisions **based on shared truths.**]{.underline} [Diplomatic expulsion
and unprecedented international cooperation on information issues are
extraordinary]{.underline} [measures taken **without abuse of state
power**]{.underline} [as in the **War on Terror**]{.underline}.
[Policies that aim to provide alternative news sources to Russian
speaking minorities in Europe **are not** **exclusionary
'othering**]{.underline},' [but are **inclusive**]{.underline} [and
offer a **broader**, **diverse**, and]{.underline} **[more
positive]{.underline}** [view]{.underline} [of the Russian diaspora than
as a monolithic fifth-column prone to side with Moscow and Putin's
regime over their new homes.]{.underline} These policies need to be
inclusive to mitigate the risk of disinformation and the subsequent
disillusion with European governments. A conscious, just policy of
securitization of disinformation must take democratic principles,
inclusion of diverse viewpoints, and the treatment of Russian minorities
into account while avoiding the misuse of state power in order to
succeed.

Conclusion

This thesis aimed to identify similar processes occurring throughout the
EU by analyzing how four individual member states have approached the
issue of disinformation. In looking at incidents of disinformation in
the UK, Germany, Lithuania, and Spain, research was conducted to analyze
the incidents themselves and how governments responded, placing that
response into the wider context of securitization within those
countries. It is clear that [there is an **ongoing process of
securitization** taking place in Europe around the issue of
**disinformation**]{.underline}. [Not all countries]{.underline}
researched [have demonstrated that disinformation has been **fully
securitized**]{.underline}, but every country had elements of
securitization taking place, such as securitizing actors and speech acts
meant to draw attention to propaganda as an existential security threat.
While these countries did show the initial factors in securitization
occurring, they chose to deal with disinformation through the route of
normal politics rather than extraordinary politics. It can be concluded
that [the]{.underline} [**[level of securitization]{.underline}** [of
Russian disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} **[within a
society]{.underline}**, [that is the treatment of propaganda and false
narratives as a security threat and how deep a country is within the
process of securitization, [played]{.mark} a **direct [role]{.mark}**
[in **shaping**]{.mark} **the [policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [those
countries pursued in order to **counter disinformation**]{.underline}.

Examining the different cases, the research showed how history,
experience, and threat perceptions related to Russia influenced
securitization of disinformation. The United Kingdom securitized Russian
disinformation in the aftermath of a catalyst event, the attempted
assassination of former GRU agent Sergei Skripal and the subsequent
disinformation campaign in its aftermath. The UK government propelled
disinformation to extraordinary politics in its diplomatic expulsion of
Russian diplomats coordinated with its allies. Lithuania securitized
Russian disinformation over a long period of time because of its complex
history with Russia and the Soviet Union, and its experience of a slow
barrage of disinformation since it regained independence. Due to decades
of experience, Lithuania pursues a more comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation, which seeks to address the threat at multiple
levels of society and multiple stages as false-narratives spread.

It was clear that other countries, and the EU as an organization, had
not fully securitized Russian disinformation, although they showed signs
they were in the process of securitization. Germany, in response to a
young girl's explosive accusations of rape in the context of the migrant
crisis, showed a clear preference for dealing with disinformation
through the normal political channels of Berlin's police department.
Spain took minimal responses through its foreign and defense ministries
and is still in the early stages of instituting policies aimed at
alerting the government to disinformation narratives. As a bloc, the EU
also failed to enact extraordinary policies to counteract disinformation
from Europe's Eastern neighbor, with a lack of coordination between the
individual member states and the supranational EU bodies.

[While some countries have securitized disinformation, other have chosen
a different route, and]{.underline} we can see how the **[different
policies]{.underline}** [enacted by these countries can either **protect
society**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[make society more
vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[disinformation]{.underline}**. [Those [countries that]{.mark} have
**[securitized disinformation]{.mark}** have]{.underline} also
[[had]{.mark} the **most [success]{.mark}** [in]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[countering]{.mark} [it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Continuous [policies
that]{.mark}]{.underline} not only track disinformation narratives and
discredit them as they emerge on a case-by-case basis, but also
[**[build resilience]{.mark}** at the source through]{.underline}
[policy efforts]{.underline} in the social, cultural, educational, and
political realm [[have **proven more effective**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Media literacy, Russian language programming, and public statements
exposing false stories can all have an impact. [[Disinformation
narratives]{.mark} have often [failed to cause]{.mark} the
same]{.underline} **[[explosive consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in
those countries that have instituted]{.underline} **[comprehensive
strategies]{.underline}** [to counter it.]{.underline}
**[[Internationalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of
counterdisinformation policies]{.underline}, **[[seeking
solidarity]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} [joint]{.underline}
[initiatives [with]{.mark} **like-minded [allies]{.mark},**]{.underline}
[has also [proven]{.mark} more [effective]{.mark}]{.underline}
[cultivating societies that are **less vulnerable** to **fake
news**]{.underline}. Diplomatic expulsions, online tracking, and
coordinated alert systems have the potential to ensure that the more
vulnerable countries in the EU do not let disinformation exert influence
on political processes and thereby endanger the bloc as a whole.

[This [paper]{.mark} has also [argued against '**negative'**]{.mark}
**conceptions** of [securitization]{.mark} in relation to the issue of
disinformation]{.underline}. It has warned that [[disinformation
**is**]{.mark} **indeed [a security threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
liberal democracies in the West, [[with]{.mark} its [ability to
**destroy**]{.mark} **foundations of [shared
truth]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially
~~cripple~~ \[**[destroy]{.underline}**\] [[democratic]{.mark}
decision-making [processes]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [While **critical
IR**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**theorists** believe]{.mark}
[securitization should be **avoided**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} [protect openness and accountability, and frame the
process in a **negative light**]{.underline}, this paper has argued that
[[securitization]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[is]{.mark} a **[necessary]{.mark} protective measure**]{.underline}
[[and **does not inherently lead to abuse of state
power**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Policies]{.mark} [pursued]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} the case study [countries that]{.mark} have
**[successfully]{.mark} [securitized
disinformation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[prove that]{.mark} while still
**extraordinary**]{.underline}, [[countermeasures]{.mark} against
disinformation **[do not]{.mark} necessarily need to [violate]{.mark}
the [democratic values]{.mark} they are meant to protect.**]{.underline}
[These policies do not need to be **exclusive** towards Russian
minorities, but [can be **inclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[contribute to public life]{.underline}**. If
European countries and the EU as an institution value the democratic
principles that govern their societies, [a conscious, successful
securitization of disinformation may be beneficial and even have
'**positive' results**.]{.underline} [[**Viewing disinformation as a
national security threat** is the path forward]{.mark}]{.underline} for

#### Securitizing nuclear deterrence failure spurs peace and disarm mobilization, NOT militarization

/GoGreen!

At this naked moment in the American experiment, when many people
perceive civilization on the verge of blowing up in some metaphorical
sense, there is an elderly man in California hoping to seize your
attention about another possibility. It is that [civilization is on the
verge of blowing up]{.underline} in a non-metaphorical sense. William J.
Perry is 89 now, at the tail end of one of his generation's most
illustrious careers in national security. By all rights, the former U.S.
secretary of Defense, a trained mathematician who served or advised
nearly every administration since Eisenhower, should be filling out the
remainder of his years in quiet reflection on his achievements. Instead,
he has set out on an urgent pilgrimage. [Bill Perry has
become]{.underline}, he says with a rueful smile, "[a prophet of
doom.]{.underline}" [His life's work]{.underline}, most of it highly
classified, [was [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---how to maximize
the fearsome deterrent power of the U.S. arsenal, how to minimize the
possibility that the old Soviet arsenal would obliterate the United
States and much of the planet along the way. Perry played a supporting
role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, during which he went back to his
Washington hotel room each night, fearing he had only hours left to
live. He later founded his own successful defense firm, helped
revolutionize the American way of high-tech war, and honed his
diplomatic skills seeking common ground on security issues with the
Soviets and Chinese---all culminating as head of the Pentagon in the
early years after the end of the Cold War. Nuclear bombs are an area of
expertise Perry had assumed would be largely obsolete by now, seven
decades after Hiroshima, a quarter-century after the fall of the Soviet
Union, and in the flickering light of his own life. Instead, [nukes
[are]{.mark} suddenly---insanely, by Perry's estimate---once again [a
contemporary nightmare, and]{.mark} an emphatically [ascendant]{.mark}
one. At the dawn of 2017, there is a Russian president making bellicose
boasts about his modernized arsenal. There is an American
president-elect who breezily free-associates on Twitter about starting a
new nuclear arms race. Decades of cooperation between the two nations on
[arms control is]{.mark} nearly [at a standstill]{.mark}. And, unlike
the original Cold War, this time there is a world of busy fanatics
excited by the prospect of a planet with more bombs---people who have
already demonstrated the desire to slaughter many thousands of people in
an instant, and are zealously pursuing ever more deadly means to do
so]{.underline}. [And there's one other difference from the Cold War:
[Americans no longer think about the threat]{.mark} every
day]{.underline}. [Nuclear war isn't the subtext]{.underline} of popular
movies, or novels; [disarmament has fallen far from the top of the
policy priority list. The largest upcoming generation, the [millennials,
were raised]{.mark} in a time [when the problem felt]{.mark} largely
[solved,]{.mark} and it's easy for them to imagine it's still quietly
fading into history. The problem is, [it's no longer fading]{.mark}.
"Today, [the danger of]{.mark} some sort of a [nuclear catastrophe is
greater]{.mark} than it was during the Cold War," Perry said in an
interview in his Stanford office, "and most people are blissfully
unaware of this danger."]{.underline} It is a turn of events that has an
old man newly obsessed with a question: Why isn't everyone as terrified
as he is? Perry's hypothesis for the disconnect is that [much of [the
population]{.mark}, especially that rising portion with no clear
memories of the first Cold War, [is suffering from a deficit of
comprehension]{.mark}. Even [a single nuclear explosion]{.mark} in a
major city [would represent an]{.mark} abrupt and possibly [irreversible
turn]{.mark} in modern life, upending the global economy, forcing every
open society to suspend traditional liberties and remake itself into a
security state. "The political, economic and social consequences are
beyond what people understand," Perry says. And yet [many]{.mark} people
[place this scenario in]{.mark} roughly the same category as the meteor
strike that supposedly wiped out the dinosaurs---frightening, to be
sure, but something of [an abstraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. So Perry
regards his last great contribution of a 65-year career as [[a crusade
to stimulate the public imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}---to share the
vivid details of his own nightmares. He is doing so in a recent memoir,
in a busy public speaking schedule, in half-empty hearing rooms on
Capitol Hill, and increasingly with an online presence [[aimed
especially at young people]{.underline}]{.mark}. He has enlisted the
help of his 28-year-old granddaughter to figure out how to engage a new
generation, including through a series of virtual lectures known as a
MOOC, or massive open online course. He is eagerly signing up for "Ask
Me Anything" chats on Reddit, in which some people still confuse him
with William "The Refrigerator" Perry of NFL fame. He posts his
ruminations on YouTube, where they give Katy Perry no run for her money,
even as the most popular are closing in on 100,000 views. One of the
nightmare scenarios Perry invokes most often is designed to roust
policymakers who live and work in the nation's capital. The terrorists
would need enriched uranium. Due to the elaborate and highly industrial
nature of production, hard to conceal from surveillance, fissile
material is still hard to come by---but, alas, far from impossible. Once
it is procured, with help from conspirators in a poorly secured overseas
commercial power centrifuge facility, the rest of the plot as Perry
imagines it is no great technological or logistical feat. The mechanics
of building a crude nuclear device are easily within the reach of
well-educated and well-funded militants. The crate would arrive at
Dulles International Airport, disguised as agricultural freight. The
truck bomb that detonates on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House
and Capitol instantly kills the president, vice president, House
speaker, and 80,000 others. Where exactly is your office? Your house?
And then, as Perry spins it forward, how credible would you find the
warnings, soon delivered to news networks, that five more bombs are set
to explode in unnamed U.S. cities, once a week for the next month,
unless all U.S. military personnel overseas are withdrawn immediately?
[[If]{.mark} this [particular scenario does not resonate]{.mark} with
you, Perry can easily rattle off a long roster of
others]{.underline}---a regional war that escalates into a nuclear
exchange, a miscalculation between Moscow and Washington, a computer
glitch at the exact wrong moment. [[They are all]{.mark} ilks of [the
same theme]{.mark}---the dimly understood threat that the science of the
20th century is set to collide with the destructive passions of the
21st.]{.underline} "We're going back to the kind of dangers we had
during the Cold War," Perry said. "I really thought in 1990, 1991, 1992,
that we left those behind us. We're starting to re-invent them. [We and
the Russians and others don't understand that what we're doing is
re-creating those dangers---or maybe they don't remember the dangers.
For younger people, they didn't live through those dangers]{.underline}.
But when you live through a Cuban Missile Crisis up close and you live
through a false alarm up close, you do understand how dangerous it is,
and you believe you should do everything you could possibly do to
\[avoid\] going back." For people who follow the national security
priesthood, the dire scenarios are all the more alarming for who is
delivering them. Through his long years in government Perry invariably
impressed colleagues as the calmest person in the room, relentlessly
rational, such that people who did not know him well---his love of music
and literature and travel---regarded his as a purely analytical mind,
emotion subordinated to logic and duty. Starting in the 1950s as a
technology executive and entrepreneur in some of the most secretive
precincts of the defense industry, he gradually took on a series of
high-level government assignments that gave him one of the most quietly
influential careers of the Cold War and its aftermath. Fifteen years
before serving as Bill Clinton's secretary of defense, Perry was the
Pentagon official in charge of weapons research during the Carter
administration. It was from this perch that he may have had his most
far-reaching impact, and left him in some circles as a legendary figure.
He used his office to give an essential push to two ideas that
transformed warfare over the next generation decisively to American
advantage. One idea was stealth technology, which allowed U.S. warplanes
to fly over enemy territory undetected. The other was precision-guided
munitions, which allowed U.S. bombs to land with near-perfect accuracy.
During the Clinton years, Perry so prized his privacy that he initially
turned down the job of Defense secretary---changing his mind only after
Clinton and Al Gore pleaded with him that the news media scrutiny
wouldn't be so bad. The reputation he built over a life in the public
sphere is starkly at odds with this latest highly impassioned chapter of
Perry's career. Harold Brown, who also is 89, first recruited Perry into
government, and was Perry's boss while serving as Defense secretary in
the Carter years. "No one would have thought of Bill Perry as a
crusader," he says. "But he is on a crusade." Lee Perry, his wife of
nearly 70 years, is living in an elder care facility, her once buoyant
presence now lost to dementia. Perry himself, lucid as ever, has seen
his physical frame become frail and stooped. Rather than slowing his
schedule, he has accelerated his travels to plead with people to awaken
to the danger. A trip to Washington includes a dinner with national
security reporters and testimony on Capitol Hill. Back home in
California, he's at the Google campus to prod engineers to contemplate
that their world may not last long enough for their dreams of technology
riches to come true. He's created an advocacy group, the William J.
Perry project, devoted to public education about nuclear weapons. He's
enlisted both his granddaughter and his 64-year-old daughter, Robin
Perry, in the cause. But if his profile is rising, his style is
essentially unchanged. He is a man known for self-effacement, trying to
shape an era known for relentless self-promotion, a voice of quiet
precision in a time of devil-take-the-hindmost bombast. The rational
approach to problem-solving that propelled his career and won him
adherents and friends in both political parties and even among some of
America's erstwhile enemies remains his guide---in this case, by
endeavoring to calculate the possibilities and probabilities of a
terrorist attack, regional nuclear war, or horrible miscalculation with
Russia. ["I want to be very clear," he said. "[I do not think it is a
probability]{.mark} this year or next year or anytime [in the
foreseeable future. But the consequence is so great, we have to take it
seriously.]{.mark} And [there are things to]{.mark} greatly [lower those
possibilities]{.mark} that [we're]{.mark} simply [not
doing.]{.mark}"]{.underline} \*\*\* Perry really did not expect he would
have to write this chapter of his public life. His official career
closed with what seemed then an unambiguous sense of mission
accomplished. By the time he arrived in the Pentagon's top job in 1994,
the Cold War was over, and the main item on the nuclear agenda seemed to
be cleaning up no-longer-needed arsenals. As defense secretary, Perry
stood with his Russian counterpart, Pavel Grachev, as they jointly blew
up missile silos in the former Soviet Union and tilled sunflower seeds
in the dirt. "I finally thought by the end of the '80s we lived through
this horrible experience and it's behind us," Perry said. "When I was
secretary, I fully believed it was behind us." After leaving the
Pentagon, he accepted an assignment from Clinton to negotiate an end to
North Korea's nuclear development program---and seemed agonizingly close
to a breakthrough as the last days of the president's term expired. Now,
he sees his grandchildren inheriting a planet possibly more dangerous
than it was during his public career. No one could doubt that [the Sept.
11 terrorists would have gladly used nuclear bombs instead of airplanes
if they had had them, and it seems only a matter of time until they try.
Instead of a retreating threat in North Korea]{.underline}, that
fanatical regime [now possesses as many as eight nuclear bombs, and is
just one member of a growing nuclear club]{.underline}. Far from a new
partnership with Russia, Vladimir [Putin has given old antagonisms a
malevolent new face. American policymakers talk of spending up to \$1
trillion to modernize the nuclear arsenal. And now comes Donald Trump
with a long trail of statements effectively shrugging his shoulders
about a world newly bristling with bombs and people with reasons to use
them]{.underline}. Perry knew Hillary Clinton well professionally, and
says he admired both her and Bill Clinton for their professional
judgment though he was never a personal intimate of either. He was
prescient before the election in expressing skepticism about how voters
would respond to the dynastic premise of the Clinton campaign---a
healthy democracy should grow new voices---but was as surprised as
everyone else on Election Day. Donald Trump was not the voice he was
looking for, to put it mildly, but he has responded to the Trump cyclone
with modulated restraint. Perry said he assumes his most truculent
rhetoric isn't serious, the utterances of a man who assumed his words
were for political effect only and had no real consequences. Now that
they do, Perry is hoping to serve as a kind of ambassador to
rationality. He said he is hoping for audiences soon, with Trump if the
incoming president will see him, and certainly Trump's national security
team, which includes several people Perry knows, including Defense
Secretary nominee James Mattis. There is little doubt the message if the
meeting comes. "We are starting a new Cold War," he says. "We seem to be
sleepwalking into this new nuclear arms race. ... We and the Russians
and others don't understand what we are doing." "I am not suggesting
that this Cold War and this arms race is identical to the old one,"
Perry added. "But in many ways, it is just as bad, just as dangerous.
And totally unnecessary." \*\*\* Perry had been brooding over the
question for a year. It was in the early 1950s, he was still in his 20s,
and the subject was partial differential equations---the topic of his
Ph.D. thesis. A particular problem had been absorbing him, day in and
day out, hours and hours on end. Then, out of nowhere, a light came on.
"I woke up in the middle of the night, and it was all there," Perry
recalled. "It was all there, and I got out of bed and sat down. The next
two or three hours, I wrote my thesis, and from the first word I wrote
down, I never doubted what the last word was going to be: It was a magic
moment." The story is a reminder of something definitional about Bill
Perry. Before he became in recent years an apostle of disarmament,
before he sat atop the nation's war-making apparatus in the 1990s,
before he was the executive of a defense contractor specializing in the
most complex arenas of Cold War surveillance in the 1960s, he was a
young man in love with mathematics. In those days, Perry had planned on
a career as a math professor. His attraction to math was not merely
practical, in the way that engineers or architects rely on math. The
appeal was just as much aesthetic, in ways that people who are not
numbers people---political life tends to be dominated by word
people---cannot easily comprehend. To Perry's mind, there was a purity
to math, a beauty to the patterns and relationships, that was not unlike
music. Math for Perry represented analytical discipline, a way of
achieving mastery not only over numerical problems but any hard problem,
by breaking it down into essential parts, distilling complexity into
simplicity. This trait was why Pentagon reporters in the 1990s liked
spending time around Perry. When most public officials are asked a
question, one studies the transcript later to decipher a succession of
starts and stalls, sentence fragments and ellipses, that cumulatively
convey an impressionistic sense of mind but no clear fixed meaning.
Perry's sentences, by contrast, always cut with surgical precision. It
was one reason Clinton White House officials often held their breath
when he gave interviews---Perry might make news by being clear on
subjects, such as ethnic warfare in the Balkans or a nuclear showdown in
North Korea, that the West Wing preferred to try to fog over. "I've
never been able to attack a policy problem with a mathematical formula,"
he recalled, "but I have always believed that the rigorous way of
thinking about a problem was good. It separated the fact from the
bullshit, and that's very important sometimes, to separate what you can
from what you would hope you can do." [Perry wishes more people were
familiar with the concept of ["expected value."]{.mark} That [is
a]{.mark} statistical [way of understanding events of very large
magnitude that have a low probability.]{.mark} The large magnitude event
could be something good, like winning a lottery ticket. Or it could be
something bad, [like a nuclear bomb exploding]{.mark}. Because the odds
of winning the lottery are so low, the rational thing is to save your
money and not buy the ticket. As for a nuclear explosion, by Perry's
lights, [the consequences are so grave]{.mark} that [the rational thing
would be]{.mark} for people in the United States and everywhere to be in
a state of peak [alarm]{.mark} about their vulnerability, [and for
political debate to be dominated by]{.mark} discussion of how to reduce
[the risk]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [And just how high is the risk?
The answer of course is ultimately unknowable. Perry's point, though, is
that it's a hell of a lot higher than you think. Perry invites his
listeners to consider [all the various scenarios]{.mark} that might lead
to a nuclear event. "Mathematically speaking, you add those all together
in one year it [is]{.mark} still [just a possibility,]{.mark} not a
probability]{.underline}," he reckons. "[But then you go out ten, twenty
years and [each time this]{.mark} possibility [repeats]{.mark} itself,
and then [it starts to become a probability.]{.mark} How much time we
have to get those possibility numbers lower, I don't know. But [sooner
or later the odds are going to get us,]{.mark} I am
afraid]{.underline}." \*\*\* Almost uniquely among living Americans,
Bill Perry has actually faced down the prospect of nuclear war
before---twice. In the fall of 1962, Bill Perry was 35, father of five
young children, living in the Bay Area and serving as director of
Sylvania's Electronic Defense Laboratories---driving his station wagon
to recitals in between studying missile trajectories and the radius of
nuclear detonations. Where he resided was not then called Silicon
Valley, but the exuberance and spirit of creative possibility we now
associate with the region was already evident. The giants then were Bill
Hewlett and David Packard, men Perry deeply admired and wished to
emulate in his own business career. The innovation engine at that time,
however, was not consumer technology; it was the government's appetite
for advantage in a mortal struggle against a powerful Soviet foe. Perry
was known as a star in the highly complex field of weapons surveillance
and interpretation. So it was not a surprise, one bright October day,
for Perry to get a call from Albert "Bud" Wheelon, a friend at the
Central Intelligence Agency. Wheelon said he wanted Perry in Washington
for a consultation. Perry said he'd juggle his schedule and be there the
next week. "No," Wheelon responded. "I need to see you right away."
Perry caught the red-eye from San Francisco, and went straight to the
CIA, where he was handed photographs whose meaning was instantly clear
to him. They were of Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba. For the next
couple weeks, Perry would stay up past midnight each evening poring over
the latest reconnaissance photos and help write the analysis that senior
officials would present the next morning to President Kennedy. Perry
experienced the crisis partly as ordinary citizen, hearing Kennedy on
television draw an unambiguous line against Soviet missiles in this
hemisphere and promising that any attack would be met with "a full
retaliatory response." But he possessed context, about the capabilities
of weapons and the daily state of play in the crisis, that gave him a
vantage point superior to that of all but perhaps a few dozen people. "I
was part of a small team---six or eight people," he recounted of those
days 54 years earlier. "Half of them technical experts, half of them
intelligence analysts, or photo interpreters. It was a minor role but I
was seeing all the information coming in. I thought every day when I
went back to the hotel it was the last day of my life because I knew
exactly what nuclear weapons could do. I knew it was not just a lot of
people getting killed. It was the end of civilization and I thought it
was about to happen." It was years later that Perry, like other more
senior participants in the crisis, learned how right that appraisal was.
Nuclear bombs weren't only heading toward Cuba on Soviet ships, as
Kennedy believed and announced to Americans at the time. Some of them
were already there, and local commanders had been given authority to use
them if Americans launched a preemptive raid on Cuba, as Kennedy was
being urged, goaded even, by Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay and other
military commanders. At the same time, Soviet submarines were armed and
one commander had been on the verge of launching them until other
officers on the vessel talked him out of it. Either event would have in
turn sent U.S. missiles flying. The Cuban Missile Crisis recounting is
one of the dramatic peaks in "My Journey on the Nuclear Brink," the
memoir Perry published last fall. It is a book laced with other close
calls---like November 9, 1979, when Perry was awakened in the middle of
the night by a watch officer at the North American Aerospace and Defense
Command (NORAD) reporting that his computers showed 200 Soviet missiles
in flight toward the United States. For a frozen moment, Perry thought:
This is it---This is how it ends. The watch officer soon set him at
ease. It was a computer error, and he was calling to see whether Perry,
the technology expert, had any explanation. It took a couple days to
discover the low-tech answer: Someone had carelessly left a
crisis-simulation training tape in the computer. All was well. But what
if this blunder had happened in the middle of a real crisis, with
leaders in Washington and Moscow already on high alert? The inescapable
conclusion was the same as it was in 1962: [[The world skirting nuclear
Armageddon]{.mark} as much [by good luck]{.mark} as by skilled crisis
management.]{.underline} Perry is part of a distinct cohort in American
history, one that didn't come home with the large-living ethos of the
World War II generation, but took responsibility for cleaning up the
world that the war bequeathed. He was a 14-year-old in Butler,
Pennsylvania when he heard the news of the Pearl Harbor attack in a
friend's living room, and had the disappointed realization that the war
might be over by the time he was old enough to fight in it. That turned
out to be true---he was just shy of 18 at war's end---a fact that places
Perry in what demographers have called the "Silent Generation," too
young for one war but already middle-aged by the time college campuses
erupted over Vietnam. Like many in his generation, Perry was not so much
silent as deeply dutiful, with an understated style that served as a
genial, dry-witted exterior to a life in which success was defined by
how faithfully one met his responsibilities. Perry said he became aware,
first gradually and over time profoundly, of the surreal contradictions
of his professional life. His work---first at Sylvania and then at ESL,
a highly successful defense contracting firm he co-founded in 1963---was
relentlessly logical, analyzing Soviet threats and intentions and coming
up with rational responses to deter them. But each rational move was
part of a supremely irrational dynamic---"mutually assured
destruction"---that placed the threat of massive casualties at the heart
of America's basic strategic thinking. It was the kind of framework in
which policymakers could accept that a mere 25 million people dead was
good news. Also the kind that in one year alone led the United States to
produce 8,000 nuclear bombs. By the end, the Cold War left the planet
with about 70,000 bombs (a total that is now down to about 15,500). "I
think probably everybody who was involved in nuclear weapons in those
days would see the two sides of it," Perry recalls, "the logic of
deterrence and the madness of deterrence, and there was no mistake, I
think, that the acronym was MAD." \*\*\* Perry has been at the forefront
of a movement that he considers the sane and only alternative, and he
has joined forces with other leading Cold Warriors who in another era
would likely have derided their vision as naïve. In January 2007, he was
a co-author of a remarkable commentary that ran on the op-ed page of the
Wall Street Journal. It was signed also by two former secretaries of
state, George Schulz and Henry Kissinger and by Sam Nunn, a former
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee---all leading military
hawks and foreign policy realists who came together to argue for
something radical: that [[the goal]{.mark} of U.S. policy [should
be]{.mark}]{.underline} not merely the reduction and control of atomic
arms, it should be [the ultimate [elimination of all nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. This sounded like gauzy utopianism,
especially bizarre coming from supremely pragmatic men. But Perry and
the others always made clear they were describing a long-term ideal, one
that would only be achieved through a series of more incremental steps.
The vision was stirring enough that it was endorsed by President Obama
in his opening weeks in office, in a March 2009 address in Prague. In
retrospect, Obama's speech may have been the high point for the vision
of abolition. "A huge amount of progress was made," recalled Shultz, now
93. "[Now [it is going in the other direction]{.mark}]{.underline}." "We
have less danger of an all-out war with Russia," in Nunn's view. "But
[we have more danger of some type of accident, miscalculation, cyber
interference, a terrorist group getting a nuclear weapon. It requires a
lot more attention than world leaders are giving it.]{.underline}"
Perry's goal now is much more defensive than it was just a few years
ago---halting what has become inexorable momentum toward reviving Cold
War assumptions about the central role of nukes in national security.
More recently he's added yet another recruit to his cause: California
Governor Jerry Brown. Brown, now 78, met Perry a year ago, after
deciding that he wanted to devote his remaining time in public service
mainly to what he sees as civilization's two existential issues, climate
change and nuclear weapons. Brown said he became fixated on spreading
Perry's message after reading his memoir: He recently gave a copy to
President Obama and is trying to bend the ear of others with influence
in Washington. If Bill Perry has a gift for understatement, Brown has a
gift for the theatrical. In an interview at the governor's mansion in
Sacramento, he wonders why everyone is not paying attention to his new
friend and his warnings for mankind. "He is at the brink! At the brink!
Not WAS at the brink---IS at the brink," Brown exclaimed. "But no one
else is." A California governor can have more influence, at least
indirectly, than one might think, due to the state's outsized role in
policy debates and the fact that the University of California's Board of
Regents helps manage some of the nation's top weapons laboratories,
which study and design nuclear weapons. Brown, who was a vocal critic in
the 1980s of what he called America\'s \"nuclear addiction,\" reviewed
Perry\'s recent memoir in the New York Review of Books, and said he is
determined to help his new friend spread his message. "Everybody is,
\'we are not at the brink,\' and we have this guy Perry who says we are.
It is the thesis that is being ignored.\" Even if more influential
people wake up to Perry's message---a nuclear event is more likely and
will be more terrible than you realize---a hard questions remains: Now
what? This is where Perry's pragmatism comes back into play. The
smartest move, he thinks, is to eliminate the riskiest part of the
system. If we can't eliminate all nukes, Perry argues, we could at least
eliminate one leg of the so-called nuclear triad, intercontinental
ballistic missiles. These are especially prone to an accidental nuclear
war, if they are launched by accident or due to miscalculation by a
leader operating with only minutes to spare. Nuclear weapons carried by
submarines beneath the sea or aboard bomber planes, he argues, are
logically more than enough to deter Russia. The problem, he knows, is
that logic is not necessarily the prevailing force in political debates.
Psychology is, and this seems to be dictating not merely that we deter a
Russian military force that is modernizing its weapons but that we have
a force that is self-evidently superior to them. It is an argument that
strikes Perry as drearily familiar to the old days. Which leads him the
conclusion that [[the only long-term way out is to persuade a younger
generation to make a different choice]{.underline}]{.mark}. His
granddaughter, Lisa Perry, is precisely in the cohort he needs to reach.
At first she had some uncomfortable news for her grandfather: [[Not
many]{.underline}]{.mark} in her generation [[thought]{.mark} much
[about the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[The more I learned from him
about nuclear weapons the more concerned I was that my generation had
this massive and dangerous blind spot in our understanding of the
world," she said in an interview. "Nuclear weapons are the biggest
public health issue I can think of]{.underline}." But she has not lost
hope that their efforts can make a difference, and today she has put her
graduate studies in public health on hold to work full time for the
Perry Project as its social media and web manager. "[It can be easy to
get discouraged about being able to do anything to change our course,"
she said. "But the good news is that nuclear weapons are actually
something that we as humans can control\...but [first we need to start
the conversation]{.mark}.]{.underline}" It was with her help that Perry
went on Reddit to field questions ranging from how his PhD in
mathematics prepared him to what young people need to understand. "As a
90s baby I never lived in the Cold War era," wrote one participant, with
the Reddit username BobinForApples. "What is one thing today\'s
generations will never understand about life during the Cold War?"
Perry's answered, as SecDef19: "Because you were [born in the
1990s]{.underline}, you did not experience the daily terror of 'duck and
cover' drills as my children did. Therefore [[the appropriate fear of
nuclear weapons is not part of your heritage, but the danger is]{.mark}
just as [real]{.mark} now as it was then. It will be up to your
generation to develop the policies to deal with the deadly nuclear
legacy that is still very much with us.]{.underline}" For the former
defense secretary, the task now is to finally---belatedly---prove
Einstein wrong. The physicist said in 1946: "The unleashed power of the
atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift
toward unparalleled catastrophe." In Perry's view **[[the only way to
avoid it is by directly contemplating
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and doing so face to face with the
world's largest nuclear power, Russia, as he recently did in a forum in
Luxembourg with several like-minded Russians he says are brave enough to
speak out about nuclear dangers in the era of Putin. "[We could solve
it," he said. "When you're a prophet of doom, what keeps you going is
not just prophesizing doom but saying there are things we do to avoid
that doom. That's where the optimism is."]{.underline}

### AT: L -- Russia

#### Securitization theory does NOT explain Russia

Studies, Universiteit Leiden, BA History, University of Amsterdam,

/GoGreen!

The main theoretical underpinning of this thesis is, as mentioned
before, that of securitisation. 13 The interesting point about this
theory as explained by Wæver and others, is that takes a post-modern
approach to security. Primarily that a discourse about security can
enforce a reality. To specify this to Russian foreign policy, when NATO
is seen as the primary adversary, every action by the alliance, such
stationing military units Eastern Europe to reassure allies and deter
possible military actions, can be viewed as a threat to Russian security
concerns. Or as Sergey Karaganov, head of the Council on Foreign and
Defense Policy, puts it in an interview with Der Spiegel, 'Now, fears in
countries like Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are to be allayed by NATO
stationing weapons there. But that doesn\'t help them; we interpret that
as a provocation. In a crisis, we will destroy exactly these weapons.
Russia will never again fight on its own territory...'14 It must be
stressed though that this securitisation debate in this case is not sole
a Russian purview. [In response to Russian actions taken in Ukraine, and
the several large military exercises in the Russian Western Military
District, a securitisation debate is taking place in the West. One
outcome of this debate were the NATO Summits of 2014, and 2016 which
were explicitly concerned with coming up with a response to Russian
military aggression.15 Therein lies also [a **weakness for**]{.mark}
**the [securitisation theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If two narratives
are put beside each other, and are then argued to be a discourse, then
we might arguably [[state a **false equivalency** about the two
narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While the Russian narrative in regard
to the West, is arguably a constructed view of the world, [Western
concerns about Russian behaviour are]{.mark} arguably [**justified** and
**a response to Russian aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other
words, [we **[must discern fact from bullshit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
Harry Frankfurt put in his article On Bullshit.16 [While it can be
argued that the current security situation is a construct, this
construct has implications in the real world]{.underline}. How did this
construct came into being? It can be argued that President Putin's
notion that the collapse of the Soviet as one of the greatest
geopolitical disasters of the twentieth century is not without merit.17
If we view the collapse of the Soviet Union as a collapse of an imperial
power, Putin's argument is understandable. Decolonisation can be a
traumatic experience, for both the coloniser, and the colonised. The
example of how France fought two destructive wars in Algeria and
Indochina reminds us, shows that this can be the case. [However, how
both parties interact with one another after the dust has settled can do
much to normalise relations between the two]{.underline}. For much of
the past twenty-six years, it seemed that new geopolitical situation in
Central and Eastern Europe was a fait accompli. Which was reinforced by
several treaties signed in the first decade after the collapse of the
Soviet Union. Treaties like the Budapest Memorandum18 and the
NATO-Russia Founding Act19 in 1994, and 1997 respectively. Even the
advent of President Putin as prime minister, and later as president,
gave no indication of major shifts in Russian foreign policy behaviour.
While there were tensions in the way NATO resolved the several Balkan
conflicts, one would have to be clairvoyant, or extremely pessimistic to
predict the current security situation in Europe. [Yet, in 2008
[with]{.mark} the five-day [war against **Georgia**]{.mark}, and the
annexation of [**Crimea** and]{.mark} starting a war in
**[Donbas]{.mark}** in 2014, Western governments were confronted by a
Russia, willing to bare its teeth to gain a geopolitical
advantage]{.underline}. The timing of these actions are arguably well
planned. [Russia, having invested heavily in upgrading its armed forces,
giving it a comparative advantage militarily]{.underline}. This
development caught European governments on a vulnerable moment, which
issued condemnatory declarations, but lacked substantial tools, save
economic sanctions, to give teeth to those condemnations. Due to
systemic defence budget cuts in the past twentysix years. [[Undeterred,
**Russian sabre rattling has continued** unabated]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The risk of **nuclear weapons use** in the Euro-Atlantic]{.underline}
region [is on the rise]{.underline}---[and it is higher than it has
**ever been** since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. This is [the
conclusion of leading security **experts** from the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [**Russia**, and
**Europe**]{.underline} who responded to a questionnaire from the
Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) in early 2015.1 While the experts
disagreed on the scale of the increase in risk and the reasons for the
change, [nearly **all shared the view** that the significant
deterioration in relations between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the Russian Federation has led to **dangerous
conditions** under which **nuclear weapons use** has become **more
likely**]{.underline}--- although the probability of this outcome
remains low. This study examined the risk of use of nuclear weapons, not
just the risk of nuclear exchange or nuclear war. In other words, the
study did not exclude the possibility of unilateral nuclear use. Indeed,
[respondents identified the possibility of unilateral nuclear use by
Russia to quell a conflict on its borders as a risk of particular
concern]{.underline}.2 Other possible nuclear-use scenarios identified
by respondents [include a **rapid escalation** due to **miscalculation**
or **accident** (such as a mid-air collision between NATO and Russian
warplanes), an escalatory response to a Russian incursion into the
Baltic States, and a Russian reaction to NATO military intervention in
Crimea or eastern Ukraine]{.underline}. The study did not assess the
relative probabilities of these scenarios. [Of all the risks examined,
it is the risk of miscalculation that is of most concern. Absent a major
incident, the likelihood of **deliberate nuclear exchange** under
current circumstances is **low**. But it is the possibility of a major
transformative event, such as a **mid-air collision** or a **skirmish**
along NATO or Russian **borders**, that is **on the rise**]{.underline}.
[Such an incident involving the world's two largest nuclear powers could
plausibly shift alert postures and lead to a **rapid series of
escalatory measures** precipitated by **miscalculation** and exacerbated
by **mistrust**]{.underline}. The following section describes in detail
the circumstances that have led to a heightened risk of escalation and
possible nuclear use in the Euro-Atlantic region. Risk Factors The
security experts who responded to NTI's questionnaire identified one or
more of the following ten reasons as contributing factors to the
heightened risk: 1. Competing, Irreconcilable Narratives That Drive
Heightened Threat Perceptions 2. A Deficit of Trust 3. Domestic
Political Imperatives 4. Alliance Politics 5. Close Military Encounters
6. Broken Channels of Communication 7. Failing Safeguards to Prevent
Nuclear Use 8. Conventional Force Disparity 9. Reckless Nuclear Saber
Rattling 10. Lack of Nuclear Experience The authors of this paper
provided supplementary research to expand on topics raised in the
responses. 1. Competing, Irreconcilable Narratives That Drive Heightened
Threat Perceptions Moscow and Washington diverge not only in their
interpretations of recent events in Ukraine but also in the basic
narratives that describe their relations during the entire post--Cold
War era.3 The Russian narrative is characterized by a combination of
grievance and resolve. Prominent Russians frequently claim that Western
powers took advantage of Moscow's weakness after the Cold War to shift
NATO borders east and bomb Russia's allies in the Balkans.4 Western
support for Ukraine's European Union association agreement, Western
sanctions against Russia, and Western demonstrations of military support
for allies on Russia's borders (military exercises, supplies of arms)
appear to reinforce this narrative of Russia as victim of Western
bullying. Prominent Russian officials thus argue that they face no
choice but to demonstrate resolve lest they invite further Western
aggression against their most vital national interests.5 The Western
narrative is starkly different. The United States and its NATO allies
view Russia as a revanchist power aggressively attempting to reclaim
influence and territory in neighboring countries that desire a break
from their Soviet legacies.6 Western officials chastise Russia for
employing tactics such as hybrid warfare, manipulation of gas exports,
and other forms of economic and military intimidation to achieve its
political aims.7 They argue that Russia's annexation of Crimea and
support for separatists in eastern Ukraine represent a major break with
the post-war order in Europe, an order that has prioritized respect for
territorial integrity and sovereignty.8 Russia's behavior in Ukraine and
the potential for Russian intervention in the Baltic States necessitate
demonstrations of resolve lest the West invite further Russian
aggression.9 These [competing, irreconcilable narratives breed
heightened threat perceptions, driving a vicious cycle of confrontation
and escalation. **[By themselves]{.mark}**, these **[threat perceptions
would not necessarily lead to nuclear use, but---combined with]{.mark}
the [factors]{.mark} described [below]{.mark}---they [create]{.mark}
dangerous [conditions under which misunderstandings could
escalate]{.mark} to unprecedented levels** of confrontation between the
world's two largest nuclear powers]{.underline}. 2. A Deficit of Trust
[Russians and Americans have returned to Cold War-era levels of
antagonism toward one another. According to a recent Gallup **poll**,
Americans now view Russia as the greatest enemy to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [edging out both North Korea
and Iran]{.underline}.10 The same poll showed that 49 percent of
Americans view Russia as a critical military threat, and [only 24
percent of Americans have a favorable view of Russia. By contrast, 62
percent of Americans held a favorable view of the Soviet Union in
1989]{.underline} (see Figure 1).11 \[ FIGURE 1 OMITTED -- Figure 1.
Americans' Favorable/Unfavorable Ratings of Russia \] [In Russia, the
trust deficit is even worse. According to a recent poll]{.underline}
conducted [by the Levada Center]{.underline}, a Russian public opinion
research organization, [only 15 percent of Russians have a favorable
view of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and 73 percent of
Russians hold an unfavorable view, a figure that nearly [doubled in the
last year]{.underline} (see Figure 2).12 Another poll released in late
June found that [62 percent of Russians believe that Russia's relations
with the West will always be characterized by mistrust]{.underline}.13
\[ FIGURE 2 OMITTED -- Figure 2. Russians' Favorable/Unfavorable Ratings
of the United States \] 3. Domestic Political Imperatives [[With]{.mark}
such [**deep antagonism permeating public opinion**, it becomes **highly
improbable** for]{.mark} elected [officials to support conciliatory
measures]{.mark}. Instead, policy **[hawks]{.mark}** who advocate
resolve and confrontation tend to **[prevail]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
such environments. This is **[[especially]{.mark} true [in
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** where President Vladimir Putin brandishes
a public image as Russia's best guardian against Western bullying.
Indeed, President [Putin's domestic approval ratings have never been
higher]{.underline}. In June, a Levada Center poll revealed that 89
percent of Russians hold a favorable opinion of their
President---Putin's highest approval rating since he succeeded Boris
Yeltsin 15 years ago.14 Considering that Russia's economy continues to
reel from the combination of low oil prices, Western sanctions, and
structural economic problems, Putin's high public approval rating
indicates that the Russian people strongly support his handling of the
Ukrainian crisis and his relations with the West. [Any departure from
the current course would almost certainly come with a heavy political
price for Putin]{.underline}. [In the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [although anti-Russian rhetoric is much less
prevalent, many public officials and political candidates also have
voiced positions favoring resolve over restraint]{.underline}. For
example, General Joseph Dunford, the Obama Administration's nominee for
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in July 2015 told a Congressional
committee that Russia poses the number one threat to the United States
and that he favors sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine. The Islamic State,
by contrast, was fourth on his list of security threats facing the
United States.15 In August, the outgoing U.S. Army Chief of Staff
General Raymond Odierno echoed General Dunford's comments by labeling
Russia "the most dangerous threat" facing the United States today.16 As
the 2016 [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} presidential election approaches,
[it is [also unlikely]{.mark} that political candidates [will
depart]{.mark} significantly [from]{.mark} this **[anti-Russia
rhetoric]{.mark}** [given]{.mark} how closely it aligns with record-high
public antagonism toward Russia. Such **[domestic political
imperatives]{.mark}**---from public opinion to political posturing---in
Russia and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [create strong
incentives for demonstrations of resolve, diminishing the chances of a
resolution to the current standoff and leading to a high risk of a
continued cycle of confrontation and escalation]{.underline}. 4.
Alliance Politics [[**Alliance politics** also contributes]{.mark} to
the rhetoric of resolve and confrontation]{.underline}.
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Eastern European and Baltic [[members
increasingly view Russia as a major threat]{.mark} and]{.underline}
voice concerns that NATO is ill-prepared to fulfill its Article 5
obligation for collective defense.17 Meanwhile, recent public opinion
polls show that most Germans, Italians, and French believe that their
countries should not use military force to defend a NATO ally (see
Figure 3).18 In this context, [NATO publics increasingly view the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the only credible military
opposition to potential Russian aggression against the
Alliance]{.underline} (see Figure 4).19 The [Obama]{.underline}
Administration [is thus faced with both political and policy imperatives
to demonstrate readiness]{.underline} to \[ FIGURE 3 OMITTED -- Figure
3. Many NATO Countries Reluctant to Use Force to Defend Allies \] \[
FIGURE 4 OMITTED -- Figure 4. NATO Countries Believe U.S. Will Come to
Defense of Allies \] fulfill its Article 5 commitments, [creating a
situation that is not conducive to promoting a conciliatory tone in
relations with Russia. This, in turn, exacerbates the risk of further
demonstrations of resolve and increases the chance of
miscalculation]{.underline}. 5. Close Military Encounters [With
**increasing frequency** and **alarming regularity**, Russian warplanes
and warships are coming dangerously close to Western military and
civilian assets, creating heightened risks for accidents that could lead
to further escalation]{.underline}. As described in a recent report by
the European Leadership Network, [these close encounters include **two
near-collisions** between Russian military jets and Swedish commercial
airliners, repeated incidents of Russian fighter jets "**buzzing**" U.S.
warships in the Black Sea, and **incursions** and near-incursions by
Russian military aircraft into NATO airspace during the last 18
months]{.underline}.20 Russia has insisted that [NATO also has engaged
in such behavior]{.underline}, arguing that NATO military exercises
close to Russian borders have "destabilizing" effects on the region.21
[In the **absence of routine**]{.underline} military-to-military
**[communications]{.underline}** (a factor described in more detail
later in this paper), [these close encounters and military exercises
create conditions under which dangerous **misunderstandings** and
**accidents** could happen---accidents with the potential to prompt
**rapid escalation**]{.underline}. 6. Broken Channels of Communication
[During the past 18 months, **institutions** designed to promote
dialogue between Western powers and Russia have been **suspended** or
**rendered powerless**]{.underline}. In March 2014, Russia's membership
in the Group of Eight (G8) was revoked and its participation in
G8-linked processes, such as the Global Partnership against the Spread
of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, suspended.22 In April
2014, Russia's representation at the NATO-Russia Council---the mechanism
designed to foster security-related consultation and consensus
building---was limited to the Ambassador-level, practically stripping it
of any meaningful working-level interactions.23 Meanwhile, Russia
withdrew from the Nuclear Security Summit process24 and suspended most
of its nuclear security cooperation with the United States.25
Military-to-military engagement on EuroAtlantic issues between NATO and
Russia, as well as the United States and Russia, has---for all practical
purposes---been terminated. Security confidence-building engagement only
continues in the context of arms control verification, an area that has
also come under considerable strain as Western powers and Russia accuse
each other of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty
violations.26 [Such **severe curtailment of communications** creates
**little room for confidence-building** and **increases** the
**likelihood** of **misunderstandings** that could lead to
**escalation**]{.underline}.

### AT: L -- Terrorism

#### Their evidence does NOT meet similar epistemological standards AND poststructuralism fails to affect either discourse or practice

**Schmid 9** - Chair in International Relations; the Director of the
Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at St. Andrews
University(Alex, Perspectives on Terrorism, v.3, issue 4, Book Review of
"Critical Terrorism Studies. A new research agenda. by Richard Jackson",
<http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine&view=article&id=96>
\*edited for ableist and gendered language

The editors accuse, in their introduction  "the orthodox field" of
orthodox terrorism studies of functioning "ideologically in the service
of existing power structures", with their academic research.
Furthermore, they claim that orthodox scholars are frequently being used
"to legitimise coercive intervention in the global South...." (p.6). The
present volume is edited by three authors associated with the Centre for
the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political Violence (CSRV)
in the Department of International Politics in Aberystwyth (Wales, UK).
They also happen to be editors of a new Routledge journal "Critical
Studies on Terrorism' . The "critical" refers principally but not
exclusively to the "Frankfurt-via-Welsh School Critical Theory
Perspective". The twelve contributors are not all equally "critical" in
aHabermasian sense. The programmatic introduction of the editors is
followed by two solid chapters from Magnus Ranstorp (former Director of
CSTPV, St. Andrews, and currently Director of the Centre for Asymmetric
Threat Studies at the Swedish National Defence College) and Andrew Silke
(formerly with the UK Home Office and now Field Leader for Criminology
at the University of East London). They both rightfully criticize some
of the past sins and present shortcomings of the field of Terrorism
Studies. One of them approvingly quotes Marc Sageman who observed that
"disagreements among experts are the driving force of the scientific
enterprise". Such [disagreements]{.underline}, however, [exist among
"orthodox" scholars]{.underline} like Sageman and  Hoffman or Pape and
Abrams. In that sense, [the [claim by]{.mark} some [critical theorists
that]{.mark} the field of traditional [Terrorism Studies is
ossified]{.mark} without them, is [**simply is not true**.]{.mark} One
of the problems with many of the adherents of the "critical" school is
that the [focus]{.mark} is almost exclusively [on
the]{.mark}]{.underline} strawman [\[[strawperson]{.mark}\] they set up
to shoot -- ["orthodox"]{.mark} terrorism [discourse rather than]{.mark}
on the **[practitioners]{.mark} of terrorism**. Richard Jackson claims
that "...most of what is accepted as well-founded 'knowledge' in
terrorism studies is, in fact, highly debatable and unstable" (p.74),
[dismissing]{.mark} thereby almost [**four decades of scholarship** as
"based on]{.mark} a series of 'virulent [myths']{.mark}, 'half-truths'
and contested claims...biased towards Western state
priorities]{.underline}" (p.80). For him "terrorism is...a social fact
rather than a brute fact" and "...does not exist outside of the
definitions and practices which seek to enclose it, including those of
the terrorism studies field" (pp.75-76). He objects to prevailing
"problem-solving theories of terrorism" in favour of an approach that
questions " the status quo and the dominant acts within it" (p.77).
[Another contributor, J.A. Sluka, argues, without offering any proof, 
that "terrorism is fundamentally a product of social inequality and
state politics" (p. 139). Behind many of the critical theorists who
blame mainstream terrorism research for taking 'the world as it finds
it' there is an agenda for changing the status quo and overthrowing
existing power structures. There is, in itself, nothing wrong with
wanting [a]{.mark} new and [better world]{.mark} order. However, it [is
**not going to be achieved by using an alternative discourse on
terrorism**]{.mark} and counter-terrorism]{.underline}. Toros and
Gunning, contributors of another chapter, state that "the sine qua non
of Critical Theory is emancipation" (p. 99) and M. McDonald als puts
"emancipation as central to the study of terrorism" (p.121). However,
there is not a single word on the non-emancipated position of women
under Islam in general or among the Taliban and their friends from
al-Qaeda in particular. [One of the strength (some argue weakness) of
Western thinking is its ability for **self-criticism**]{.underline} --
something largely absent in the Muslim world. In that sense, this volume
falls within a Western tradition. However, self-criticism should not
come at the cost of not criticising   adversaries by using the same
yardstick. In this sense, this volume is strangely silent about the
worldview of those terrorists who have no self-doubts and attack the Red
Cross,  the United Nations, NGOs and their fellow Muslims with equal
lack of scruples. [A number of authors in the volume appear to equate
terrorism uncritically with political violence in general while in fact
it is more usefully thought of as one of some twenty sub-categories of 
political violence - one characterized by deliberate attacks on
civilians and non-combatants in order to intimidate, coerce or otherwise
manipulate  various audiences and parties to a conflict.]{.underline}
Part of the volume advocates reinventing the wheel. J. Gunning, for
instance, recommends to employ Social Movement Theory for the study of
terrorism. However, that theory has been employed already explicitly or
implicitly by a number of more orthodox scholars, e.g. Donatella della
Porta. [[Many "critical"]{.mark} [statements]{.mark} in the volume [are
**unsupported by convincing evidence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g. when
C. Sylvester and S. Parashar state "The September 11 attacks and the
ongoing war on terror reinforce gender hierarchy and power in
international relations" (p.190). [Jackson claims that the key question 
for critical terrorism theory is "who is terrorism research for and how
does terrorism knowledge support particular interests?" (p.224) It does
not seem to occur to him that **he [could have studied]{.mark} this
question by looking at** the practitioners of terrorism and study
**[al-Qaeda's]{.mark}** ideological **[writings and its
training]{.mark}**  and  recruiting **[manuals]{.mark}**. If CTS is a
call for "making a commitment to emancipatory praxis central to the
research enterprise" (R. Jackson et al, p. 228), CTS academics should be
the first on the barricades against jihadists who treat women not as
equals and who would, if they get their way, eradicate freedom of
thought and religion for all mankind. It is sad that some leading
proponents of Critical Terrorism Studies appear to be in fact
**uncritical**]{.underline} and ~~blind on one eye~~.
