The What, Why, and How of Security Assistance

[[**"Security assistance"** refers to]{.mark} a specific set of
[programs]{.mark} authorized by the Foreign Assistance Act and Arms
Export Control Act]{.underline}. These programs are [[overseen
by]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark} Department**]{.underline} in cooperation
with the Department of Defense. [[**"Security cooperation"** describes
separately authorized **Defense**]{.mark} **Department**-[led
activities]{.mark}]{.underline} such as "global train and equip"
programs. The Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which has provided
military aid to that country since 2016, is one such example of these
programs run by the Pentagon. I will use the more common term here,
security assistance, in reference to either type. When security
assistance works well, it gives partner nations the tools to address
internal instability and deter and defend against external adversaries,
reducing the likelihood that direct U.S. intervention will be called for
in the future. It also helps to ensure that the United States maintains
access, basing, and overflight privileges, strengthens interoperability,
and accrues the less tangible benefit of military-to-military personal
relationships.

[U.S. **[security assistance is broken]{.mark}**]{.underline} and in
need of an overhaul. Over the past two decades, [the bureaucratic
system]{.underline} developed [to deliver]{.underline} billions of
dollars of [**military aid** to partner nations has evolved]{.underline}
and expanded [not by design but [as the result of]{.mark} a series of
**[ad hoc]{.mark}**]{.underline} legislative and **[[policy
changes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[Though]{.mark} the]{.underline} U.S.
[Department of [**State** was **initially in charge**]{.mark} of
security assistance policy]{.underline} and accounts, since 9/11, the
U.S. Department of Defense (**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [has
established a **[separate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, well-funded
**[[security assistance bureaucracy]{.underline}]{.mark}** at the
Pentagon. [This has **[inhibited]{.mark} effective congressional
[oversight]{.mark}**, **[harmed]{.mark} coordination** between
**[diplomacy]{.mark}** and defense, and contributed to the **[growing
militarization]{.mark}** of U.S. foreign policy. It has created [a
**dysfunctional** and **bifurcated**]{.mark} security assistance
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Under the current security assistance system, the [returns
on]{.underline} America's [security investments are limited,
inconsistent, and not strategic]{.underline}. The
**[consequences]{.underline}** of today's broken system [include
**[increased reliance on the military]{.mark}** to solve foreign policy
challenges; a perpetuated status quo whereby nondemocratic partners
receive U.S. assistance and where **human rights abuses are ignored**;
and an **ineffective and unwieldy bureaucracy**. **This matters**
because the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [depends on capable
allies and partners]{.underline} as a core component of its national
security strategy, [but the current system is not suited to the
task]{.underline}. A new administration can change this by embracing
wholesale reform of the security assistance system. To do so, however, a
Biden-Harris administration must move quickly to work with Congress and
include such reforms in any effort to rebuild and revive U.S. diplomacy.
This will require talking not only about security assistance
authorities, but fundamentally about money and resources as well. Any
reform efforts intending to bolster the role of the State Department
must start by examining how funding is oriented and balanced between the
departments. This necessitates close cooperation with the Hill.

There must be a dramatic realignment of U.S. security assistance. This
report provides an overview and a systemic critique of the current
bureaucratic structure of U.S. security assistance and outlines how
[**[transferring resources and responsibilities for security
assistance]{.mark}** back [to]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department
[will **better**]{.mark} advance U.S. interests and [address]{.mark} the
current **[geopolitical challenges]{.mark}** America
confronts]{.underline}. [It calls for [**reviving the centrality of
diplomacy** by restoring]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department's
role, as originally intended under U.S. law, [as]{.mark} the
[**overseer** of **all**]{.mark} U.S. **[foreign
assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} offers
recommendations for **[[expanding]{.underline}]{.mark}** and training
the **[[security assistance]{.underline}]{.mark}** workforce, improving
interagency coordination, elevating human rights concerns in security
assistance policy, [[and **adapting best practices from**]{.mark} **the
[DOD]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Contributes to the militarization of foreign policy

[The current security assistance system contributes to the
militarization of U.S. foreign policy. Militarizing foreign policy
entails the **[increasing use of the military]{.mark} to solve foreign
policy challenges** and [**results in a bloated DOD budget** with
**more**]{.mark} **resources and [authority]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Researchers describe it as a phenomenon whereby ["the military **more
and more [becomes the primary actor]{.mark}** and face of U.S. policy
abroad," [**leading to a cycle** in which]{.mark} the [DOD]{.mark}
requires and receives significantly more resources than any other
foreign policy agency and [is]{.mark} thus **[increasingly relied
on]{.mark}** to solve U.S. foreign policy problems]{.underline}.62
[[There are **several elements** of]{.mark} a [militarized
fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy in today's security assistance system,
**[but primarily]{.mark}**, the [DOD's control of]{.mark}]{.underline}
significantly [[**more security assistance resources** puts]{.mark} the
Pentagon---rather than diplomats---[in the driver's seat in
**policymaking**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Pentagon's significant resources [also distort the face of U.S.
security assistance on the ground]{.underline}. Gordon Adams, a former
White House budget official, warned, "[**[Who owns the ball matters
here]{.mark}** because it colors the way the U.S. engages
overseas]{.underline}. If American engagement wears a uniform ... that's
one form of interaction. If it involves the ambassador and the \[U.S.
Agency for International Development\] and people doing governance work,
it's a different set of missions and [[there's a **hugely different
perception**]{.underline}]{.mark}."63 [**[Recipient countries]{.mark}**
can **[utilize this to their advantage]{.mark}**]{.underline}; foreign
officials may more eagerly seek to follow through or make progress on
DOD requests or priorities, such as going through with a significant
military exercise or a ship visit, while [ignoring or **[slow-rolling
State]{.mark} Department [requests]{.mark}** or priorities, such as
releasing a dissident or altering an economic regulation]{.underline}.
And if the interlocutor that matters in relations with the United States
is the military, the subject that matters is defense. [The **[Pentagon's
priorities]{.mark}** can therefore **[end up carrying more
importance]{.mark} with partners** than the State Department's broader
foreign policy concerns, making combatant commands more powerful than
any diplomat. When the State Department is deprived of resources, or cut
out of the decision-making process]{.underline} entirely, [diplomats
cannot effectively weigh in]{.underline} on whether a proposed sale or
package makes sense given a range of other nonmilitary concerns that may
exist in a bilateral relationship. In short, [money is power, and the
DOD has the money]{.underline}.

[[The net effect]{.mark} is that U.S. **[fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy
[is less coherent]{.mark}**[, with **Pentagon policy more
likely**]{.mark} **to be [out of sync]{.mark}** with broader foreign
policy concerns]{.underline}. For example, the DOD's U.S. Africa Command
posture review is being conducted with little to no coordination with
the State Department, and the rumored outcome is to call for reduced
U.S. presence and security investments in order to free up DOD resources
to focus on competition with Russia and China.64 Yet the United States
still has serious security and geopolitical interests in the continent
that are likely not reflected in traditional military-only
decision-making. Rachel Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center,
warned that [developing military-to-military security assistance
programs is "an important relationship, one that should be cultivated,
but it is not separate from the diplomatic and foreign policy
relationships that have to be developed and take time. If you lose the
foreign policy piece and just focus on the security piece, you're
[doing]{.mark} a [disservice to]{.mark} the larger **[strategic
objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}."65 [The **[siloed]{.mark}** security
[assistance]{.mark} system leads to disjointed U.S. foreign policy,
**[divorces security]{.mark} concerns [from]{.mark} broader [economic or
diplomatic concerns]{.mark}**, and can **[end up promoting militarized
solutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Perpetuates the status quo in security relationships

The current security assistance framework at the State Department and
the DOD often perpetuates the status quo by creating incentives to
continue providing assistance to the same partners. Between
congressionally mandated allocations to large security partners in the
State Department's FMF assistance and specific authorities created for
certain countries, there are often few built-in incentives to reexamine
a partner's record or backsliding. And when reviews are done, there is
strong resistance to shift funding due to the potential fallout. Rarely
is the top consideration the effectiveness of assistance. In an
interview with the authors in June 2020, Anthony Wier, a former deputy
assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Legislative
Affairs, explained, "Right now, the best predictor for what we propose
to spend this year is what we proposed last year -- in other words, the
whole system is basically just drifting from year to year."66

This greatly affects the perception of other U.S. security assistance
partners. Countries know that the United States is unlikely to cut
assistance, even despite bad behavior, in order to avoid harming a
bilateral relationship. Recipients take note of such reluctance to pull
aid even when gross abuses occur and thus ignore U.S. chastising on bad
behavior. As long as the United States is unwilling to cut off
assistance or move funds elsewhere after a country commits actions that
U.S. officials oppose, security assistance will provide no foreign
policy leverage.

Harms democratic progress and enables human rights violators

Current [**security assistance** policy, **divorced from other foreign
aid considerations**, [**hampers** pursuing]{.mark}]{.underline} this
[[**values-based policy** and]{.mark} does **not effectively** elevate
**human rights** and [**democracy** concerns in the]{.mark}
decision-making [process]{.mark}. This is **dangerous** because the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[ends up supporting
**autocratic regimes** with serious **governance** and **stability**
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}. Yemen, for example, received more than
\$300 million in security assistance through the DOD's train and equip
authority between 2010 and 2015, yet researchers documented human rights
abuses perpetrated by the government and possible diversion of U.S.
aid.67 Worse still, the perception that U.S. aid was fueling conflict
led much of the Yemeni public to believe that the United States was
primarily responsible for the destruction of the Saudi-led coalition in
the current war.68 Today, the conflict in Yemen is the world's worst
humanitarian crisis.

[An **[overly militarized security assistance]{.mark}** policy [makes it
harder to support **emerging democracies**]{.mark}. Building up security
forces without accompanying reforms to strengthen civilian oversight can
[lead to **coup-proofing**]{.mark} or consolidation around a political
leader, [rather than]{.mark} the development of [a **competent**
force]{.mark}]{.underline}.69 [Often, these impacts are **[not
prioritized by]{.mark}**]{.underline} security assistance practitioners;
for example, [the **[DOD]{.mark}**]{.underline}'s relative spending on
building up partner security institutions, such as the Defense
Institution Reform Initiative, was \$32.6 million in fiscal year 2019,
compared with \$1.9 billion of overall spending.70 At the same time, the
DOD's investment in institutional capacity building far exceeds the
State Department's investment in these efforts---an example where the
State Department will have to incorporate and improve on the DOD's
practices.

While U.S. laws technically prohibit providing security assistance to
units found to violate human rights---the Leahy laws---the provisions
are riddled with loopholes and are too weak to effectively prioritize
human rights in U.S. security assistance.71 [Offices and agencies
responsible]{.underline} for elevating human rights in U.S. foreign
policy, [such as the **[State]{.mark}** Department['s **Bureau of
Democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Human Rights, and Labor, [are too
often [**cut out** of the]{.mark} decision-making [process for]{.mark}
security assistance [programs]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially those
[[run out of the **Pentagon**]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time,
[the **Pentagon** maintains its **own security assistance**
accounts]{.underline}, such as Section 127e, [that are not required to
conduct human rights vetting and operate [with **little
transparency**]{.mark}---furthering opportunities to militarize foreign
policy]{.underline}.72 And often, such as in the case of Egypt,
[security assistance is accompanied by paltry amounts of democracy,
human rights, and **governance funding** (DRG)]{.underline}, or
certifications on human rights are waived entirely, to make providing
arms more palatable.73 [These **small [DRG funds]{.mark}** [or
**certification stops** **do little**]{.mark} to change the underlying
political challenges [or are]{.mark} sometimes even **[hampered by the
regime]{.mark}** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
funding]{.underline}.

[[**NATO** is at a **critical moment**]{.underline}]{.mark} of
re-invention. The alliance [[survived]{.underline}]{.mark} the
tumultuous years of the **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** presidency --
[in practice, U.S. commitments to collective defense remained strong,
and defense spending across the alliance has been growing]{.underline}
every year since 2015. The next question is how the alliance can not
only survive but thrive. [**NATO** will need evolve to **adapt** to an
**ever-increasing** array of **threats**, from **disruptive
tech**nologies to renewed **great power competition** with **China** and
**Russia**. And because adversaries target not only NATO's borders but
strike society **within NATO countries**, the alliance will [need to
give **more attention** to]{.mark} defending against **[threats at
home]{.mark}**. Improving NATO's resilience needs to go
**[beyond]{.mark}** shoring up critical infrastructure and
**[cyber]{.mark}** capacity [to bolster]{.mark}ing the
**[democratic]{.mark} principles** and [**systems** that **underpin the
alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The North Atlantic Treaty that set up NATO in 1949 explicitly recognizes
the NATO allies' determination to "safeguard the freedom, common
heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law." My colleagues and I
at the Alliance for Securing Democracy called on NATO to uphold these
values within the Alliance and with partner countries in a policy
blueprint for countering authoritarian interference in Europe.

Establishing a Center for Democratic Resilience at NATO would be one way
to achieve the goal of safeguarding democracy and upholding the values
on which the alliance was founded. The exact structure of a NATO body
focusing on democratic resilience can vary, yet the need to address both
external and internal threats to democracy is paramount.

Democracy: Not outside the scope of NATO

Democracy does not go beyond the scope of NATO. The alliance's founding
treaty foresees NATO not only as a body for collective defense but also
for political consultation. And this provision would allow NATO members
to draw on each other for support and guidance on countering threats to
their democratic processes and institutions.

[NATO exists [to]{.mark} help its members protect themselves and assist
each other in [counter]{.mark}ing **[existential threats]{.mark}** --
those against **territorial integrity** as well as **political
independence**]{.underline}. Article Five's collective defense
provisions against armed attack are well known. But Article Four of the
Washington Treaty calls on members to "consult together whenever, in the
opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political
independence or security of any of the Parties is threatened."

[Russia and other **[authoritarian states]{.mark}** seek to
**[undermine]{.mark}** democratic and electoral processes in
**[NATO]{.mark} countries** [through **cyber attacks**,
**disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation** campaigns, **[economic
coercion]{.mark}**, among other tactics. These **[asymmetric
efforts]{.mark}** can erode the political independence of NATO states,
undermine their sovereignty, and if successful, [alter]{.mark} the
direction of **[NATO policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is at the heart
of the question of political independence for individual allies and NATO
as a whole.

[The need to counter threats to democracy is growing]{.underline}. The
Alliance for Securing Democracy's Authoritarian Interference Tracker
[logs [**600 instances** in which **Russia** or **China**]{.mark} have
sought to **[undermine democracy]{.mark}** across forty NATO and
non-NATO democracies in North America and Europe]{.underline}. Russia
began using many of these tools, from economic coercion to information
manipulation, in the Soviet era. But in recent years, [**other
autocratic states** including China are learning from Russia's
example]{.underline}. In the Covid-19 pandemic, China has increasingly
piggybacked off Russia's information network and imitating its tactics.

[Being vocal about the values of democracy, liberty, and the rule of law
matters in and of itself. **[If]{.mark}** these [**values** were **put
forward more prominently**]{.mark} at the alliance]{.underline}, as a
Center for Democratic Resilience could do, [NATO members [would]{.mark}
feel more accountable on the question of values and democratic health to
their fellow allies. Expectations on good governance should be made
clear in routine NATO operations. Moreover, **focusing on these values**
may allow NATO countries to [**build confidence and support** for
democratic systems **at home**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[Not only external threats]{.underline}**

[[The **external** dimension]{.mark} of threats against democracy may be
fairly **[straight-forward]{.mark}** to address at NATO]{.underline}.
Allies could come together, ideally in a regular manner such as that
which would be provided by a Center for Democratic Resilience, to assess
and provide solutions for minimizing threats. [**[But]{.mark}** **if**
NATO is [to **counter**]{.mark} the **[threats]{.mark}** posed by
**Russia**, and increasingly, **China**, it will [have to
address]{.mark} **vulnerabilities within** European societies -- **how
countries choose** partners for technological innovation, trade, and
infrastructure projects as well]{.underline}. [These are the
**vulnerabilities** that allow economic coercion, cyber-attacks, and
information manipulation to take hold]{.underline}.

[A difficulty for NATO will be to address internal issues in member
states. But NATO will need to find a way to address **[domestic threats
to democracy]{.mark}**. Extremist groups **within NATO societies** are
now taking up the tactics started by Moscow, from information
manipulation to cyber-attacks]{.underline}. Political leaders in NATO
members have taken steps to restrict democratic freedoms in their
countries. A NATO node for democratic resilience could work in
cooperation with civil society and other international organizations to
address these more sensitive domestic issues.

determine if other agencies of the U.S. Government are working with a

The Importance of Central and Eastern Europe

[[**Central and Eastern Europe** is]{.underline}]{.mark} one region that
is [strategically [important for a **democratic revival the world
over**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and for the United States in general.
Since the end of the Cold war, the eastern half of Europe has seen
remarkable progress in democratic transformation and integration with
European and transatlantic institutions. [Over the last
decade]{.underline}, however, [the democratic momentum has weakened
across the region and reversed in some cases]{.underline}. [Central
Europe, once the vanguard of reform toward liberal democracy, has seen
substantial **[backsliding]{.mark}**, with democratic institutions
hollowed out, the rule of law undermined, and spaces for independent
media and civil society shrinking]{.underline}. In the Western Balkans
and Eastern Europe, past and present conflicts combined with unclear
prospects for Euro-Atlantic integration have long hampered full
democratic transformation. Authoritarianism has crept back in,
facilitated by disappointment with democratic reforms and promoted by
external autocratic powers---primarily Russia but increasingly also
China---that view the region as an arena of competition in which to
challenge the democratic West.

[Reversing this regional dynamic must be a priority for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and for the global community of
democracies for several reasons. [First, if in Central and Eastern
Europe, decades of democratic reform and achievement can be completely
undone, this will **[send a fatal signal to democrats across the
globe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The world's democratically minded
[**citizens and leaders will be discouraged**, while **skeptics and
autocrats will feel vindicated**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Second, if a
**democratic vacuum** is allowed to open in Central and Eastern Europe,
[**authoritarian powers** will]{.mark} seize the opportunity to
**[expand]{.mark} their [influence]{.mark}**. [The region will]{.mark}
once again [become a **hotbed** of **instability**]{.mark} and
stagnation, [**conflict** and **great-power
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline} that it has long been in its history.
[Third, democratic decline and authoritarian meddling, instability and
insecurity will not be limited to Central and Eastern Europe but [will
**spill over westward**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} European
and [transatlantic democratic community is already struggling with the
fallout from the regional downward spiral, including waning **political
cohesion** and worsening security. Stopping these trends in the region
will require a full democratic renewal]{.underline} and a long-term push
for integration for those of its countries that are still outside of
Euro-Atlantic structures.

This importance of Central and Eastern Europe for the global revival of
democracy is clearly reflected in the regional perspectives brought
together in this paper. Civic leaders and policy experts from across the
breadth of the region present the expectations in their respective
countries of what the United States can do to support democracy better
there and of the Summit for Democracy process. Their contributions,
while rooted in the specific realities of each country, highlight
overarching challenges facing the region. They also outline how the
United States and other international partners can address these through
diplomacy, engagement, and democracy assistance, as well as how the
Summit for Democracy and the subsequent year of action can have an
impact.

The Role of the United States

The contributors to this paper [signal the **urgent [need]{.mark} for [a
shift in U.S. policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward Central and Eastern
Europe. Over the past decade and across the region, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has been
[**perceived** as]{.mark} increasingly disengaged, [inattentive]{.mark}
to rising challenges to democracy, [and **overly
security-focused**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, hopes are high
that it will become more involved again in Europe's eastern half, and
that it will put in practice a greater emphasis on democracy as central
to the region's broader development and security. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[partnerships]{.mark} with
Central and Eastern Europe's governments [should]{.mark} thus [be
**conditioned**]{.mark} again [on]{.mark} their full commitment to
**[democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the rule of law, broad citizen
participation, the unhindered involvement of civil society, and the
safeguarding of diverse and independent media. Those perpetrating state
capture and high-level corruption in the region must be shunned by
Washington, while abuses of state power need to be sanctioned, elections
safeguarded, and full (re)democratization made a clear prerequisite for
U.S. partnership with individual governments.

In addition to this general setting of democracy at the heart of U.S
regional policy, there are expectations across Central and Eastern
Europe for actions in specific policy areas. These include assistance
with reforms of justice and law-enforcement systems, and capacity
building in security sectors to avert an increasing number and variety
of threats. Washington should employ its economic muscle, through trade
agreements and investment in strategic industries to incentivize
democratic performers, and use its investigative and sanctions muscle to
punish those that undermine democracy and security in the region. The
management and eventual resolution of the many conflicts across the
region, and the different necessary reconciliation processes, will
equally require stronger U.S. engagement. [Such renewed U.S. involvement
in Central and Eastern Europe is to be accompanied by strong
coordination [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the European Union and
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** whose doors need to remain open to any
country wishing and qualifying to accede Euro-Atlantic structures.

If It Feels Like [[the]{.mark} **19[30's Are Repeating]{.mark}**
Themselves --- Only **[With Nukes]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- That's
Because They Are

There are two ways to think about the Russia's bloody and brutal and
criminal war in Ukraine. One is that Putin is a madman --- with nukes.
The second is even more chilling. It's that [**[Putin]{.mark}** himself
is [a mere **symptom**]{.mark}**, of deeper forces**]{.underline}. These
forces are vast and impersonal --- just forces of history, like great
currents beneath the waves of oceans. What do I mean? This second way to
think --- and the more that I reflect on it, the more accurate way,
perhaps --- goes like this.

[We have [many]{.mark}]{.underline}, many [Big **[Existential
Threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a world. [**[Climate change]{.mark}**,
mass extinction, **[ecological collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, now **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But [**[underlying all]{.mark}** of these
--- [and **unifying them**]{.mark} --- [is]{.mark} a deeply disturbing
**[political reality]{.mark}**. Over the last decade]{.underline} or
two, [[the planet has swung]{.underline}]{.mark} so **[[far
right]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it might as well have tilted on its
axis. We are beginning to live on a far right planet.

And [what kind of]{.underline} life, civilization, [**[future]{.mark}**
is really possible on a far right planet? **[Not]{.mark}** a
**[democratic]{.mark}** one. **[Not]{.mark}** a **[peaceful]{.mark}**
one]{.underline}. It looks a lot like....this one.
**[[War]{.underline}]{.mark}**, chaos, **[[hate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
rage.

This is a sea change. We haven't lived on a far right planet for a long
time. [The **last time** we had hints of such a thing was in the
19**30s**. What's happening today]{.underline} may be [even **more
troubling**]{.underline}, though, [because it's **more
widespread**]{.underline}. I [don't think]{.underline} modern
[history]{.underline} --- or even semi-modern history --- [has seen the
entire planet swing far right so fast and hard]{.underline} that the
globe is juddering in fear and agony.

Let me give you several examples of what I mean --- and then I want to
discuss why this is happening. We'll start with rich countries --- who
are the obvious ones.

In America, it's true, that Joe Biden's President --- but it's truer
that half the country or more is in open revolt against not just him,
but the idea of liberal democracy. To teach kids that gay people exist
is now a crime. Women's rights are being taken away. Minorities are
openly scapegoated. Yet another Black man was just shot in the head by a
police officer...for nothing...on video. And shortly, every indication
is that America's conservatives are going to sweep into power, and
reduce democracy to a shell, having laid the groundwork to snatch the
election by whatever means necessary, from perverting electoral
mechanisms, to another coup.

America's new wave of laws attacking women and minorities and even
teachers --- tip lines, informants, secret polices --- have roots in the
Fugitive Slave Act, which deputised anyone to be a vigilante, and
inspired the Nazis. That is how regressive its right wing revolt really
is. America is therefore already ranked as a flawed democracy.

Take another set of rich Western countries, though. [**Britain**'s head
of state is literally now found to have broken the law]{.underline}. He
didn't resign. Instead, he came up with a plan to ship...refugees...to
Rwanda...which is an authoritarian, totalitarian state whose record on
human rights abuses is abysmal...and all that's flagrantly against the
law...again. None of this is remotely compatible with liberal democracy
--- from the rule of law to equality to justice to truth.

Then there's Australia. Australians, deeply nationalistic people, think
proudly of themselves as a liberal democracy, and fly into a rage when
you criticise their nation. Yet the truth is their PM is a climate
change denier, they pioneered the idea of human trafficking refugees to
other countries --- breaking international law --- they have the highest
per capita carbon emissions on the planet, and none of this seems to
matter at all to them very much. Like Britain, for all intents and
purposes, Australia is heading towards the far right. How else would you
describe one whose PM denies climate change, while its ravaged by
megafloods and storms and fires --- and people just shrug?

[In **France**]{.underline}, of course, [Marine Le Pen is within
striking distance of the Presidency]{.underline}. She comes from a
family of proto-Nazi sympathizers, and openly backs Putin. Elected,
[she'd shred the West]{.underline}. She's [already called for **NATO**
to]{.underline} effectively [be broken up, and Frexit]{.underline} to
happen. [The EU would no longer exist]{.underline} as we know it. France
is right on the brink of joining America, Australia, and Britain in
hurtling towards far right politics.

Now, the rejoinder to all this will be: "At least we're not Rwanda!!"
But that isn't the test of a liberal democracy. It's whether, obviously,
a nation is living up to the ideals of a democracy. Whether it values
freedom, equality, truth, justice, decency, the rule of law, and so
forth. It's all too easy to see that in the cases I've presented to you,
these things now have little value. When your head of state denies
climate change --- truth? LOL. When he breaks the law and covers it up
by breaking the law --- justice? LOL. When a society has tip lines to
inform on neighbours for the crime of reading banned books --- equality?
Freedom? LOL.

This phenomenon stretches right around the world. It's not just the rich
world, the West, turning so far right that Adolf Hitler's grinning
approvingly, it's also, obviously, the rest of it. Just two short
decades ago, there were high hopes that Russia would evolve into a
mature, stable, healthy democracy. Instead, it imploded into Putinism
--- and war. The same, more or less, is true in China and India. Across
Asia and Africa and Europe, too. The planet is turning far right.

This is a scary thing. It has never really happened before. Yes, really,
never.

[Political scientists]{.underline}, scratching their heads, began to
[[call this]{.underline}]{.mark} phenomenon "**[[democratic
backsliding]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [But that]{.underline} turn of
phrase is inaccurate. It [implies that democracy is failing from both
sides, left and right]{.underline}. We don't live in an age, though,
where the far left is overthrowing legitimately elected democracies. We
live in one where the far right is. "Democratic backsliding" is
therefore [another way]{.underline}, really, [to say]{.underline} ---
not say, in fact --- "[we are beginning to live on a far right
planet]{.underline}."

/GoGreen!

OVERVIEW

[[**NATO** becomes defunct due to **death by a thousand
cuts**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The gradual [erosion of]{.mark} the
**[cohesion]{.mark}**, political will, credibility, military capability,
and relevance of the alliance]{.underline} described in our baseline
scenario [is [accelerated by]{.mark} several factors]{.underline}.
[These include]{.underline} an economic downturn, [increasing
nationalism and protectionism]{.underline}, the absence of U.S.
leadership, divergent interests, and threat perceptions, [and a
[**disregard** for]{.mark} common **[values]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
interests. Defense budgets in the United States and Europe decrease, and
countries prioritize national defense needs over multilateral solutions.
These [tensions lead to open conflict among several Allies, including
Greece and Turkey]{.underline} who regularly challenge one another over
their respective activities and rights in the Eastern Mediterranean.
They hold hostage NATO defense plans, training and exercises, and
missions. Still, other allies appear willing to do China's bidding, for
example, by limiting access to key ports and railways. Finally,
[[adversari]{.mark}al actor[s]{.mark} calculate that NATO lacks the
political resolve and military capability to fulfill its core tasks,
**[testing]{.mark}** this [with]{.mark} several incidents]{.underline}.
[These include [a **cyberattack** that takes out the]{.mark} **electric
[grid]{.mark}** in several NATO countries; while there is intelligence
that Russia is behind the attack, not all allies deem it credible, and
NATO fails to respond]{.underline}. In another incident, Russia claims
that temporarily breaching Lithuania's territorial integrity is
necessary to defend Belarus. Though disturbed, most allies overlook the
incident to avoid escalation; NATO fails to invoke Article 5, and a
subset of allies respond in Lithuania's defense outside the alliance's
framework.

THREAT AND OPPORTUNITY ENVIRONMENT

Migration, terrorism, climate change, and growing nationalism emerge as
the primary concerns of European NATO allies. These emanate from growing
instability along Europe's periphery and a severe economic downturn,
particularly in southern Europe. While allies recognize the aggressive
nature of some Russian and Chinese behavior, they elect to try to manage
this through a combination of diplomacy, economic leverage, and avoiding
provocative actions. The security environment in Afghanistan
deteriorates rapidly into the tribal and ethnic fragmentation of the
1990s, with regional actors supporting competing militias. This
increases regional instability and causes an outflow of refugees to NATO
countries, especially Turkey. NATO's plans to train Afghan civilians and
the Afghan National Security Forces fall apart as allies fail to stand
by their financial commitments or to provide the necessary trainers due
to force-protection concerns. The Taliban retake the country, and there
is an embarrassing scramble to evacuate the Kabul International Airport
and any remaining NATO civilian or military personnel. NATO's
credibility is weakened even further, both for "abandoning" the Afghan
government and for leaving the country in essentially the same position
as it was when NATO went in in 2003.

AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE SECURITY PARTNERS

The European Union proves a more effective actor than NATO in countering
the security challenges that most concern European NATO allies (i.e.,
migration, terrorism, climate, and nationalism). Thanks to some European
allies' efforts to limit NATO's role in cybersecurity and defense,
building resilience, and managing emerging and disruptive technologies,
the European Union has also become a viable security actor in these
areas. European allies move away from hedging their security bets
between NATO and the European Union to prioritizing EU defense and
security arrangements outside of NATO. Perceiving the alliance's loss of
relevance even among its own members, like-minded Indo-Pacific partners
disengage with NATO in favor of the European Union or select EU member
states.

ADVERSARY INFLUENCE

Sensing NATO's weakness and U.S. disengagement, China mounts a new charm
offensive to secure access to European markets. Looking to boost their
own struggling economies through trade with China, European countries
are receptive. Russia, sensing its moment to secure sanctions relief and
undercut NATO's raison d'être, behaves more agreeably toward allies that
seek a more cooperative relationship with it in order to reduce their
security burden. This lulls many Europeans into a false sense of
security, and they calculate that---with the United States disengaging
and disinvesting from NATO---the time is ripe for a "grand bargain" with
the Kremlin that involves dissolving the alliance in exchange for a new,
more comprehensive security arrangement. This arrangement precipitates
U.S. military withdrawal from Europe.

SHARED IDENTITY, VALUES, AND INTERESTS

[It becomes evident that the notion of a NATO based on shared identity
and **values** has been an **illusion** for some time. Populist and
nationalist tendencies that were present when the economy was good
accelerate with]{.underline} the [economic downturn]{.underline}.
**[Within NATO]{.underline}** and the European Union, [**[democratic
backsliding]{.mark}** goes unchecked and **[creates societal
vulnerabilities]{.mark}**, such as corruption, [that **adversaries
exploit**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[NATO's **attractiveness**]{.mark} to
new members [and **cred**]{.mark}**ibility** as a force for good is
[damaged by]{.mark} the [**perception** that it is **unable to keep its
own house in order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. National interests are
pursued at the expense of the collective good.

U.S. LEADERSHIP

The United States decreases its defense budget even as it faces a more
demanding security environment outside of Europe. It loses patience with
European allies' failure to assume their share of the burden, stand up
to Russia and China, or allow NATO to adapt to address new and emerging
security threats. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [comes
to view NATO not as a force multiplier for U.S. influence and interests,
but rather as a burden and constraint; it withdraws significant forces
from Europe and reduces its financial, force, and capability
contributions to NATO]{.underline}.

RESPONSIBILITY SHARING

The economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic brings an end to
consecutive years of growth in NATO defense spending. Only countries
with sizeable domestic defense industries (i.e., the United States,
France, and United Kingdom) maintain higher levels of spending, and the
majority of this is directed not to meeting NATO requirements but rather
to sustaining their own industries. [[As a result, **China** and
**Russia** outpace]{.mark} most allies [with]{.mark} respect to
**[emerging]{.mark} defense [tech]{.mark}**nologies [like]{.mark} that
make use of innovations in **[a]{.mark}**rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence and quantum computing]{.underline}. Angered by
the lack of progress on arms control and shocked by the escalating cost
of nuclear modernization programs, Congress refuses to fully fund
nuclear modernization, undermining extended deterrence and forcing the
United States to reconsider its nuclear posture in Europe.

NATIONAL DYNAMICS

In response to the economic downturn, countries become more nationalist
and protectionist. National leaders searching for a scapegoat for their
economic and social woes blame multinational organizations, claiming
that they unnecessarily constrain countries' freedom of action---such as
to limit the number of immigrants or to manufacture beyond emissions
limits. Some walk away from their international treaty commitments
(including on climate action, arms control, and human rights) or ignore
their obligations to intergovernmental organizations (such as NATO, the
European Union, the United Nations, and the World Trade Organization),
further damaging the credibility of these institutions.

Conclusion

As ever, the key to NATO's continued survival will be its ability to
adapt to a changing external security environment in keeping with the
security needs of its members. [[Merely raising]{.mark} the level of
[**ambition** without ensuring]{.mark} political **[cohesion]{.mark}**
and adequate resources [will **only undermine** the alliance]{.mark}'s
credibility and relevance for the next decade]{.underline}.

An examination of the above potential trajectories can assist NATO
allies in effecting the future they wish to see. While the future is
inherently unpredictable, keeping the alliance on the positive
trajectory will require more equitable burden sharing within NATO;
leveraging the competencies of other capable actors, such as the
European Union and like-minded global partners; investing in innovation
to maintain NATO's technological edge; and building resilience to
counter adversaries' attempts to divide the alliance. Conversely,
[**[if]{.mark}** unity of purpose and **[shared values are
lost]{.mark}**, the security burden is carried by only a few allies,
internal resilience is unaddressed, and U.S. leadership is absent, NATO
will find itself on the negative trajectory. And [while]{.mark} the
status quo of "muddling through" **[may seem good enough for
now]{.mark}**, it [will]{.mark} likely also [land]{.mark} NATO [on the
**negative trajectory over time**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Turns deterrence and war with Russia

These threats are paramount. [Often **overlooked**]{.underline},
however, [is the **threat from within**: **NATO** member governments
gradually **undermining their own democratic institutions**, unraveling
the common tie between members of an alliance]{.underline} "founded on
the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law,"
[and thereby undercutting it]{.underline} as an effective guarantor of
the "freedom and security of all its members."

Yes, [[**NATO** must]{.mark} continue to **[deter]{.mark}** its external
adversaries---principally **[Russia]{.mark}**. [But **democratic
regression**]{.mark} among its own members **[makes that task more
difficult]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[In alliance states like [**Turkey**, **Hungary**]{.mark} and
**[Poland]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the rise of authoritarian parties by
democratic means has led to crackdowns on those same democratic
processes that brought them to power. Other member nations, ranging from
**[[Slovakia]{.underline}]{.mark}** (where a journalist investigating
government corruption was recently assassinated) to [the **[Czech
Republic]{.mark}**]{.underline} (whose Freedom House national democratic
governance ranking declined over the past year) to the United States
itself (where Trump, the ostensible leader of the free world, routinely
lavishes praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin), [exhibit worrying
trends]{.underline}. All have been countered to varying degrees by
pushback among civil society, the judiciary and independent media.
Nonetheless, [this [**rising illiberal tide** risks]{.mark} exposing
NATO members to **Russian subversion**, thereby [**reducing the
alliance's cohesion** and **effectiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
weakening its important post-Cold War role as a consolidator and
defender of democracy. While NATO has completed several out-of-area
missions in places ranging from the Balkans to Afghanistan to Libya,
many today question whether the alliance would militarily defend one of
its own member states.

This is not the first time NATO has faced democratic backsliding within
its ranks. At the alliance's creation in 1949, authoritarian Portugal
was a founding member; it would remain a dictatorship until 1974. When a
group of Greek military officers launched a coup against their
democratically elected government in 1967, NATO did not expel the
junta-led regime. Nor did the alliance move against Turkey when its
military repeatedly overthrew various civilian administrations.

Such decisions to overlook the authoritarian character of certain NATO
members could---and were---justified as the sort of necessary evil
compelled by the Cold War's bipolar logic: Soviet communism was the
preeminent threat to the West and, whatever their faults, the
authoritarian regimes in Greece, Turkey and Portugal were reliably
anti-communist.

Today, the geopolitical situation has changed dramatically. While Russia
has reemerged as the principal ideological and strategic adversary of
the West, no longer does the Kremlin espouse Marxist-Leninism but rather
a cynical illiberalism that exploits corruption, nativism and strongman
rule. Moscow has gone from being a revolutionary power to a reactionary
one. But its antagonism toward the United States and its allies remains.
The Kremlin perceives Russia's national interest as destabilizing
Western institutions like NATO and the European Union, and [the
**increasingly illiberal governments** across the
West]{.underline}---the sort that, during the Cold War, would have been
resolute foes of Soviet influence---[can today be **[low-hanging fruit,
ripe for Russian picking]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### AT: !/D -- No DPT

#### Best studies disprove the confounding variables their ev cites and empirically confirm our impacts

The **[[democratic peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the idea that
democracies rarely fight one another--- has been called "[[the closest
thing]{.mark} we have [to an **empirical law**]{.mark} in the study of
international relations]{.underline}." [Yet, [some contend]{.mark} that
this relationship [is **spurious**]{.mark} and [suggest **alternative
explanations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, in the absence of
randomized experiments, we can never rule out the possible existence of
such confounding biases. Rather than commonly used regression-based
approaches, [we apply a **[nonparametric sensitivity
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We [[show]{.mark} that
**[overturning]{.mark} the negative association** between democracy and
conflict [would **require a confounder**]{.mark} **that is [forty-seven
times more prevalent]{.mark}** in democratic dyads than in other
dyads]{.underline}. To put this number in context, [[the
relationship]{.mark} between democracy and peace [is **at least five
times as robust** as]{.mark} that [between **smoking and**]{.mark}
**lung [cancer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To explain away the democratic
peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful
confounders than those already identified in the literature.

The proposition that democratic states do not fight interstate wars
against each other is one of the most enduring and influential ideas in
international relations. The idea is theoretically rooted in the work of
Immanuel Kant, who argued that interactions between states with a
republican form of government give "a favorable prospect for the desired
consequence, i.e., perpetual peace."1 This has led to a large literature
empirically documenting a negative association between democracy and
conflict,2 leading one scholar to comment that the democratic peace is
"the closest thing we have to an empirical law in the study of
international relations."3

[Despite the law-like nature of this association, no scholarly consensus
has emerged on whether the observed association reflects a causal
relationship or a spurious correlation]{.underline}. According to a
recent survey, more than 30 percent of international relations scholars
disagree with the democratic peace theory.4 In particular, [skeptics
have challenged the democratic peace by arguing that **alliance**
structures]{.underline} from the Cold War,5
**[capitalism]{.underline}**,6 [and contract-intensive
**economies**]{.underline}7 confound the observed association. [These
authors find that adding certain **confounding variables** to regression
models **eliminates the statistical significance** of the estimated
coefficient for the joint democracy variable]{.underline}.8

How should we resolve this empirical debate regarding the democratic
peace?9 Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized experiments, we can
never completely rule out the possible existence of confounding biases
that arise from omitted variables. While [[scholars]{.mark} in this
literature have [**exclusively** relied on **parametric regression
models**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this approach requires strong
assumptions, namely that the model accurately characterizes the true
data-generating process (correct set of variables, right functional
form, valid distributional assumption, etc.). Given that these
assumptions may not be verifiable from observed data, [it is no surprise
that various scholars advocate different regression models [with
**diverging**]{.mark} **sets of [variables]{.mark}**, [resulting in
**contradictory findings**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The difficulty of
adjudicating between these alternative modeling approaches has led to
the ongoing controversy in the empirical democratic peace literature.

We propose [an alternative approach based on **nonparametric sensitivity
analysis**]{.underline} to formally assess the robustness of the
empirical evidence.10 Specifically, we [**quantify** the strength of
**confounding relationships** that could explain away the observed
association between democracy and peace]{.underline}. That is, we
compute the precise level of unobserved confounding needed to render the
observed association between democracy and conflict spurious. The idea
is that although not all correlations imply causation, a very strong
correlation suggests it. [Unlike the parametric regression modeling
approach prevalent in the literature, the proposed **[nonparametric
sensitivity]{.mark}** approach **[directly addresses]{.mark}** the
existence of unobserved **[confounders]{.mark}** without assuming a
particular regression model]{.underline}.11 Although one can never know
with certainty from observational data whether democracy causes peace,
[this nonparametric sensitivity analysis can formally assess the
robustness of **empirical evidence** for the democratic
peace]{.underline}.

Our analysis applies the nonparametric sensitivity analysis method
originally developed by Cornfield and colleagues, who were concerned
with the robustness of the positive association between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer in the potential presence of unobserved
confounders.12 The study of the causal relationship between smoking and
lung cancer closely parallels the dispute on the democratic peace. In
both cases, randomized experiments cannot be conducted for ethical and
logistical reasons, and critics contend that the observed association
suffers from confounding biases. While no definitive conclusion can be
drawn from observational data, Cornfield and colleagues argue that no
existing confounder can explain the strong association between smoking
and cancer and therefore this relationship is likely to be causal. Their
conclusion is worth quoting here:

Cigarette smokers have a ninefold greater risk of developing lung cancer
than nonsmokers, while over-two-pack-a-day smokers have at least a
60-fold greater risk. Any characteristic proposed as a measure of the
postulated cause common to both smoking status and lung-cancer risk must
therefore be at least nine-fold more prevalent among cigarette smokers
than among nonsmokers and at least 60-fold more prevalent among
two-pack-a-day smokers. No such characteristic has yet been produced
despite diligent search.13

Our application of nonparametric sensitivity analysis to the democratic
peace yields striking results. Depending on the definition of democracy,
we find that a confounder must be at least forty-seven times more
prevalent in democratic dyads than in other types of dyads. Thus, any
potential confounder that could explain the democratic peace would have
to be at least five times as prevalent as a similar confounder for
smoking and lung cancer. In other words, according to our analysis, [the
positive association between democracy and peace is much more robust
than that between smoking and lung cancer]{.underline}.

While no such confounder has yet been found for the relationship between
smoking and lung cancer, [we examine whether the confounders identified
in the democratic peace literature]{.underline} meet the conditions of
nonparametric sensitivity analysis. [For example, we consider a set of
**[economic]{.mark} confounders** proposed by Gartzke who argues that
the democratic peace can be explained by **capitalism**]{.underline}.14
We [[also]{.mark} consider other confounders, such as **military
[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 [Overall, our [findings]{.mark}
imply that for a potential confounder to explain away the democratic
peace, it must be much more strongly associated with regime types and
conflicts than the confounders that have been proposed to date. This
finding again [demonstrate]{.mark}s [the **robustness** of **empirical
evidence** for]{.mark} the **[democratic peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Finally, we believe that a nonparametric sensitivity analysis, such as
the one we use here, can play an important role in international
relations research, where the threat of omitted variable bias is almost
always present. Although sensitivity analysis has been applied in
international relations, almost all such applications have been based on
parametric regression models. In the democratic peace literature, Kadera
and Mitchell conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis in the spirit of
Leamer.16 In addition, Chaudoin, Hays, and Hicks apply a parametric
sensitivity analysis of Altonji, Elder, and Taber to the effects of the
GATT/WTO, whereas Hegre and Sambanis use the method of Sala-i-Martin to
examine the sensitivity of empirical results on civil war onset.17 The
only exception we found is Davis and Shirato, who use a nonparametric
sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of their findings to
possible sample selection bias.18 [Unlike parametric approaches,
nonparametric sensitivity analyses avoid modeling assumptions and hence
offer a robust method to examine the strength of empirical
conclusions]{.underline}.

### AT: !/D -- Collective Action

#### Best studies prove short-termism, truth decay, and weak multilateralism are NOT inherent to [democracy]{.underline}, but to [backsliding]{.underline} -- and [democracy's net better]{.underline} at overcoming [collective action]{.underline} problems

[[Although **democracies** do **better on average** than
**authoritarian** s]{.mark}ystems]{.underline}, climate change is an
issue that poses specific challenges to the governing capacity of
democracy. The challenge of climate change is complex and has sometimes
been described as a 'wicked problem'. It is an issue in the interface
between natural and human systems, and therefore it affects all spheres
of life, but in unpredictable ways. The complexity of climate change is
one of the prime reasons why democracies have failed to deal adequately
with the crisis. [The climate crisis is]{.underline} moreover [a global
challenge, and democracies have not sufficiently managed to act beyond
the constraints of the national states. The **[short-term
focus]{.mark}** of most democratic decision-making has been an
additional weakness]{.underline}. Democracy is a system limited by time
and space, while the problem of climate change runs across generations
and national borders. [Moreover, the influence of fossil fuel
**[lobbyism]{.mark}**, **corruption**, **policy [capture]{.mark}** [and
**weak**]{.mark} **institutional [capacity]{.mark}** [have **hampered
democracies**]{.mark} from acting responsibly]{.underline}.

As this paper demonstrates, [**democracies [nevertheless possess several
advantages]{.mark}** when it comes to tackling the climate crisis.
Governing systems that allow **[civil participation]{.mark}**, a **[free
flow of info]{.mark}**rmation [and processes of **assessment and
evaluation**]{.mark} seem to be [**more capable** than
**authoritarian**]{.mark} **regime[s]{.mark}** [in **dealing
with**]{.mark} **issues of great [complexity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**[Studies]{.mark}** on climate change cooperation have also
[shown]{.mark} that, [**in general**, **democracies** are **more
active** in **international negotiations** and **more likely** to
**keep**]{.mark} **their political [commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The international cooperation on climate change relies to a great
extent on open and democratic societies, providing a base for
journalists and civil society organizations covering and reporting on
the negotiations and monitoring compliance]{.underline}. [Moreover,
**[tech]{.mark}nological [innovation]{.mark}**, particularly [on
**renewable energy**, has made]{.mark} the [solutions]{.mark} to the
climate crisis less cross-border intensive and extensive, motivating
both individual countries, regions and cities, and companies,
communities and individuals, to act on their own. Active engagement by
individuals and civil society organizations can create pressure for
strong policy responses on a local, national and global
level]{.underline}.

[[**Studies** also show]{.mark} that [**democracies** are
**improving**]{.mark} their performance [on **long-term
policies**]{.mark}---for instance, [on **climate action**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} on the United Nations **[Sustainable
[Development]{.mark}]{.underline}** Goals. [Institutional changes, such
as the adoption of climate legislation and advisory bodies, and
activities within democracies, such as the youth-driven climate movement
and processes of climate litigation, have made them even **[less
vulnerable to short-termism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Despite this,
democracies are still not delivering on their climate
pledges]{.underline}. [In many **fragile democracies**, **corruption**
is obstructing the policymaking process on climate and preventing
adequate and efficient implementation]{.underline}. The fossil fuel
industry still wields substantial influence on politics in several
democratic countries. In this respect, the lack of trustworthy and
independent public institutions, with the ability to counteract policy
capture and corruption, protect human rights, and deliver on the
principles of the rule of law and good governance, is a serious barrier
on the path towards a sustainable future.

[In conclusion, functioning [**democracy is essential** to]{.mark}
effectively [deal with the **climate crisis**]{.mark};
**[however]{.mark}**, as long as [many]{.mark} democracies are
[suffering from]{.mark} their own **[institutional failures]{.mark}**,
they **will not be able deliver** adequately. Consequently, [**efforts**
to]{.mark} develop and **[support democracy around the world need to be
sustained]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but it is also necessary to undertake
certain measures, activities and reforms to make democracy more able to
tackle the climate crisis. The policy advice in this paper focuses on
the necessity to overcome short-termism, ensure citizen participation,
act on climate injustice, develop knowledge-based decision-making and
strengthen the state capacity. Further research on the nexus of
democracy and climate is also needed, to better understand both the
effects climate change could have on democracy as such and how
democratic governance could be developed to become more capable of
dealing with the crisis at hand.

### AT: Ukraine Thumps

#### Ukraine does NOT thump -- [only]{.underline} has a global effect [if NATO backsliding is solved]{.underline}

**Tharoor 22** Ishaan Tharoor, columnist on the foreign desk of The
Washington Post, authors the Today\'s WorldView newsletter, former
senior editor and correspondent at Time magazine, "The war in Ukraine
underscores a moment of democratic crisis," The Washington Post,
4-20-2022,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/20/democratic-decline-authoritarianism-ukaine/>
/GoGreen!

Such visions send ripples through the post-Soviet world. A handful of
countries once in Moscow's orbit are doing their best to toe a different
line. The Baltic states, [[members of]{.mark} both **[NATO]{.mark}** and
the E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion, have flung themselves
into the resisting the Russian advance next door; tiny Estonia, for
example, has already committed nearly 1 percent of its total gross
domestic product in support of Ukraine's fight. They comprise the
spearhead of a galvanized Western response to Putin's war.

But beyond the conflict, there's a deeper disquiet in many other
countries that were once in the Soviet sphere. A new report from Freedom
House, a Washington-based think tank that tracks democracy around the
world, found that only six of 29 countries spanning from Central Europe
to Central Asia managed to maintain a "consolidated" democracy, while
most others [[drifted toward authoritarianism]{.mark} or a bleak "gray
zone" where the trappings of democracy truss up illiberal or autocratic
political project]{.underline}. This is [certainly on view in
Hungary]{.underline}, where Prime Minister Viktor Orban recently won
reelection in a political context widely seen as unfair and stacked
against the opposition.

Freedom House marked the 18th consecutive year of democratic decline in
this region, a trendline that dovetails with the organization's broader
prognostications about the ailing state of democracy the world over. But
[the countries in question]{.underline} in this report [[matter as
a]{.mark} kind of **[bellwether]{.mark}**:]{.underline} After the end of
the Cold War, the [pursuit of liberal democracy in many states once
under the Soviet yoke captured the imagination of]{.underline} American
[strategists and observers]{.underline}, and seemed to portend a new,
happy era of global politics. That liberal heyday, though, has now
clearly passed.

"In this emerging era, liberal democracy no longer prevails as the
assumed goal of national political development," the Freedom House
report notes. "[Increasingly, the countries of Central and Eastern
Europe and Eurasia are headed toward]{.underline} two different
destinations: [the abyss of full-blown autocracy and the gray zone of
hybrid governance, where ostensibly democratic structures belie
undemocratic practices]{.underline}."

Freedom House deploys a scoring system that rates individual countries
on criteria like the integrity of electoral processes, the strength of
civil society and the independence of the judiciary. Across the board,
it found worrying declines. In autocratic states from Belarus to the
five former Soviet republics in Central Asia, "longtime despots stamp
out dissent and fortify themselves against perceived foreign and
domestic enemies." Meanwhile, even relatively healthy democracies in
places like Slovenia and Slovakia have been "buffeted by the corrosive
effects of illiberalism and corruption."

At the heart of the storyline is Russia under Putin. Not only has the
Russian leader embarked on a ruthless campaign of repression at home,
rapidly transitioning what was a "soft dictatorship" into a "raw
dictatorship" --- as [Freedom House President Michael Abramowitz
told]{.underline} Today's WorldView --- but Kremlin influence operations
have also played a significant role in undermining democratic
governments in Russia's neighborhood. The war in Ukraine, of course, may
derail the country's slow, fitful progress toward strengthening its own
democracy.

"Ukraine, while not a perfect democracy, was relatively speaking one of
the countries that had been doing fairly well in the region in general,"
Abramowitz said. "Obviously now with the invasion, the future of
democracy in Ukraine is very much in question."

Abramowitz added that [he his "**[hopeful]{.mark}** that [this will be a
**turning point**]{.mark}]{.underline}" --- that [**[Ukraine's
defiance]{.mark}** of the Russian war machine [and the **Western bloc's
newfound unity** can **embolden action against autocrats**]{.mark} and
sharpen policies that weaken their oligarchic supporter]{.underline}s.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the report adds, **[[more needs to be
done to strengthen democracy internally]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
including within the European Union, where officials in Brussels
struggle [[to arrest]{.mark} the **democratic [backsliding]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} countries like [**Hungary** and
**Poland**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Similar concerns also exist in Washington, consumed, as it is, by
political polarization and its own illiberal assaults on democracy. Some
commentators urge Americans to see their politics in line with countries
elsewhere. "If the United States seeks to stem the decline of liberal
democracy abroad and patch the flaws in our democracy at home, we must
treat them as part of a single set of related problems, unimpeded by
borders, languages, or religions," wrote Ryan Suto, a senior policy
adviser at FairVote Action, which campaigns for electoral reforms in the
United States. "That is, support for the rule of law and liberal
democracy must be valued in both foreign policy and domestic policy."

### AT: US Thumps

#### It only demonstrated the [resilience]{.underline} of democracy, does [NOT thump]{.underline}

**Walsh 21** Nate Walsh, Emmy award-winning CNN International Security
Editor, "America was lucky to be saved by its democracy \-- even if some
don\'t realize it," CNN, 1-8-2021,
<https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/08/opinions/america-saved-by-democracy-paton-walsh/index.html>
/GoGreen!

Even in the aftermath, America might not see how fortunate it is.

Most \"attempted coups\" elsewhere in the world leave a hangover of
giddying uncertainty - shops shuttered, presidents in hiding, the
television playing a nature documentary or half the staff in the hotel
you are staying in not turning up for work.

However, [America\'s extraordinary privileges of law and functionality
seemed to sustain, even in a brief moment of collapse]{.underline}.
Wednesday was a six-hour catastrophic policing failure, one that finally
served up an image of what the souring of democracy can look like, after
years of appeasement and detachment by ordinary voters.

Yet [still America woke up to relative order]{.underline}. The system
had overnight thrived persistently - news networks broadcasting and
dissecting the events, with variety and transparency, and the wheels of
vote certification turning, as expected. Americans perhaps also took
that for granted: that they turned on the TV to hear criticism of their
president, that the police and national guard swooped in to enforce the
law, that outrage - not fear at the new unknown - dominated. Chaos
normally follows disorder, but in the United States the cogs kept
whirring.

It\'s been **[[easy to say]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** version of [[**democracy** was
**irreparably damaged**]{.mark} by Wednesday, January 6.
**[But]{.mark}**, once Moscow, Beijing and Tehran have finished gloating
briefly, remember too the **[signals]{.mark}** that the day
**[sent]{.mark}** about [its **resilience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes,
the United States witnessed a mob of mostly White men breaking into its
Congress, because they felt the law was theirs alone, and because so
many ordinary Americans spent four years thinking the horror was either
too ridiculous to fear, or would just pass. [But in the end, the quieter
majority, not the loudest voice, remained standing]{.underline}. This
short moment of ugly collapse should not lead Americans to dismiss the
extraordinary eloquence and value of their system.

The rioters abused the privileges of their wealthy democracy - their
free lives, in the richest nation on earth - to indulge in a
fantastical, parallel reality, and livestream on open social media their
breaking into the seat of government. It was a spoilt child version of
America - so \"free\" to do whatever it wants, it ignored the truths,
laws and decency that actually enabled that freedom. [Elsewhere
globally, scenes like these normally follow actual tyranny and absurd
vote-rigging, palpable repression and torture - not fictional complaints
that have had their (multiple) days in court]{.underline}.

Wednesday\'s violence didn\'t really fit the conventional description of
an \"attempted coup\" - normally a word evoked when the military or
security forces help change who\'s in power. \"Coup\" became part of the
day\'s hurried lexicon perhaps as what was happening was so alien and
unimaginable - in a capital city so absorbed with the infallibility of
its processes, that it didn\'t really have the vocabulary for this
violence. But the less-privileged former Soviet Union - where even
slight gasps of freedom have been very hard won - can offer comparisons
as plentifully as Eskimos are said to have words for snow.

This wasn\'t a \"colored revolution\" - like the \"Orange\" one in
Ukraine in 2004, where hundreds of thousands of patient protestors stood
in the cold for months to successfully reverse a blatantly fraudulent
election. It wasn\'t the \"Tulip\" one of Kyrgyzstan in 2005, when
protesters - some on horseback, also angry at a patently rigged vote -
fought their way into the presidential administration, drank its liquor,
rode on its exercise bikes, all while armed security forces were
unwilling to open fire.

It was uglier. It reminded me most of Ukraine in 2014, when an organized
group of pro-Russian protesters forced their way into the local
administrations of Donetsk and Slovyansk. The \"Q-Shaman\" would have
fit right in that mob too. These brief, drunken moments of violence and
shouting were the sparks that ignited a civil war which killed
thousands. The media was also attacked then by the crowd, fired up by
incendiary broadcasting from Russian state-media available in the east
of the Ukraine. Crimea had earlier been invaded. It was a clockwork plan
for occupation by Moscow.

But [when you woke up each morning in Donetsk, the system continued to
fall apart. In]{.underline} Washington [DC, the opposite was
true]{.underline}. [[The **system**]{.underline}]{.mark} is busying
itself with **[[rectifying the problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
extraordinary privileges Americans live with daily - and that perversely
led a handful to think the armed invasion of Capitol Hill was OK - were
still there.

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates\' [[**allies** and **enemies**]{.mark}
will [globally chew]{.mark} on this moment - for signs that it foments
China\'s rise, or gives Putin another decade in power]{.underline}, or
makes Maduro seem comparatively competent.
**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** remember, between horror at what a sense
of privilege among a small mob can do, [there is **also** a moment of
hope. **[Values worked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unlike elsewhere in the
past decades, [the departing President\'s supporters did not take
over]{.underline} parliament and change the government. [The army did
not switch sides]{.underline}. The rightful winner of the last election
is not in hiding - he broadcast a speech, and will be president in
several days. Two members of the slavishly loyal cabinet resigned.

Trump has done damage to democracy\'s reputation globally in ways I
never imagined I would see. President-elect Joe [Biden is right to say
it is \"**fragile**.\" It is **also**]{.underline} precious, and
**[effective]{.underline}**. For now, it worked. [[**Trump** and]{.mark}
the **[domestic terrorism]{.mark}** he fomented [were]{.mark} - in this
moment - **[defeated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There turned out to be
enduring values at the heart of even some of the most compromised
American elected officials. [[That is **not a global
norm**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Now is not a time for chest-thumping over American values that have
slowly deteriorated for years to get to this point. But it should also
not lead a country to be so spoiled in its own privileged system that it
dismisses its extraordinary merits altogether. [**[Democracy didn\'t
fail]{.mark}** the United States, [it]{.mark} pretty much
**[saved]{.mark} it**]{.underline}.

[The **singular reason** the **US system has advantages over its
authoritarian rivals** is that it is based on]{.underline} the **[open
competition]{.underline}** and truth of ideas. The morning after this
failed coup, the United States didn\'t wake up to a nature documentary
on state TV, or find half the hotel staff missing, but was alive with a
renewed vigor of self-criticism in rolling news coverage.

They should be mindful of how they might appear to those who woke up
that morning in actual tyrannies: Many perhaps taking for granted how
lucky they are to live in a nation where [such a staggering **[abuse of
democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline} can **[[still]{.underline}]{.mark}** be
**[[eclipsed by its virtues]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### AT: US Not Key

#### US key -- relative power

**Wallander 18** Celeste A. Wallander, President and CEO of the U.S.

Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Russian and
Eurasian Affairs at the National Security Council, "NATO\'s Enemies
Within: How Democratic Decline Could Destroy the Alliance," Foreign
Affairs, 97(4), July/August 2018, pp.70-81, JSTOR /GoGreen!

But [procedural fixes to inoculate the alliance against weak links are
not enough]{.underline}. NATO might be able to deal with, say, a
repressive Turkey by pushing it to the sidelines of core missions and
decisions. NATO rules do not formally provide for such an approach, but
the organization is good at finding procedural workarounds, and it is at
least possible that the Turkish leadership would not object. It would be
quite another matter if a core NATO member departed from the alliance\'s
liberal democratic foundations. How could NATO sideline or work around
France, or Germany, or the United States?

[The best defense lies within the member states themselves]{.underline}.
NATO can structure disincentives and punishments for backsliders, but
only citizens can hold elected leaders accountable. [[**Most
important**, the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[must rise to meet the
challenge]{.mark}. The decline of liberalism among core NATO allies is
concerning]{.underline}: Germany represents the transatlantic phoenix
rising from fascism\'s ashes; France is the symbol of resistance through
occupation; the United Kingdom was where Europe kept hope alive in World
War II. But it was the United States that saved the twentieth century
from dictatorship and helped Europe achieve prosperity, security, and
stability. NATO might survive European publics toying with fascism
(although it should limit the experiments). It cannot survive if U.S.
liberal democracy fails.

Americans must face the fact that the biggest threat to NATO today may
be the United States itself. Regardless of political party and policy
preferences, all Americans have a patriotic interest in protecting the
laws, practices, and institutions of U.S. liberal democracy. This is not
merely a matter of domestic politics; it is also a matter of national
security. Threats to democracy at home have already undermined
Washington\'s ability to work with allies in a dangerous, uncertain, and
threatening world. [[As the **most powerful member of NATO**, the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [**must take the lead** through
a]{.mark} bipartisan **[defense of liberal institutions and
values]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Today, fundamental threats to NATO come from its own members. [These
challenges cannot be resolved in NATO\'s shiny new headquarters in
Brussels through procedural modifications or by pointing fingers at the
worst offenders]{.underline}. They must be defeated at home.

Moving forward, [democracy must be shown to work]{.underline}. Our
Democracy Playbook14 (attached for reference) highlights strategies and
tactics for pro-democracy actors to not only push back against illiberal
and authoritarian-leaning actors, but also to renew the promise and
resiliency of democratic institutions. While there will be no single,
perfect strategy to best counter these illiberal challenges and rebuild
trust in our alliance, we are dedicated to doing our part to equip
democratic actors to defend and rebuild our democratic institutions,
revitalize trust in democracy, and come together in common cause.

Before I conclude by sharing a few of our recommendations, I wanted to
summarize five of the key points that should underpin [a strategic
approach to **reinvigorating democracy** as a **security imperative**
for the alliance]{.underline}.

> backward, and it requires active support at all levels]{.underline}.

>
> • Russia is an adversary to NATO, it seeks to bring chaos to the
> transatlantic system and destabilize democratic institutions.
>
> • Corruption is weakening the alliance from within
>
> • Technology has forever changed the operating environment for
> security and democracy

[The far-reaching consequences of a decade-long run of authoritarian
resurgence makes renewing and reenergizing liberal democracy in the
trans-Atlantic space all the more necessary. To remain relevant, the
transatlantic alliance and its leaders and institutions must be able to
defend against and confront these current challenges]{.underline}.

This was the wrong choice then and an even worse one today. [The **risks
of ignoring NATO's internal strains far outweigh** the benefits of
addressing them]{.underline}. Some of the reasons are longstanding: A
country's treatment of its own citizens [reflects, positively or
negatively, on **NATO's brand**, and an unstable domestic environment
inhibits]{.underline} that country's [ability to meet]{.underline} its
[international obligations]{.underline}.

Today, though, ignoring democratic decline carries new risks. NATO's
adversaries have become increasingly skilled at taking advantage of and,
in some cases, actively exacerbating countries' societal
vulnerabilities. A compromised media environment allows disinformation
campaigns to flourish, while corruption opens space for Russian networks
to operate and gain influence. Moscow is also preying on the grievances
of racial and ethnic minorities in NATO member countries in order to
weaken national-level governance and cohesion.

In this context, [**democratic decline** has empowered the leaders of
some NATO states to take self-serving decisions at the expense of the
alliance's collective interests]{.underline}. In both Turkey and
Hungary, for example, hypernationalism and corrupt ties with Russia have
led to decisions that [have compromised NATO decision-making and
**weakened** the alliance's **military readiness**]{.underline}. Turkey
recently acquired a Russian S-400 missile system, for example, which can
undermine NATO's integrated air defense, and then launched an invasion
of northeast Syria that endangered NATO countries' forces on the ground.
More recently, Turkey also blocked a defense plan for the Baltic states
and Poland on the grounds that NATO did not sufficiently support its war
against Kurdish separatist forces. Hungary has helped hamstring NATO, as
well. In 2019, Budapest blocked Ukraine's NATO Membership Action Plan
and canceled meetings of the NATO-Ukraine Commission over a bilateral
dispute regarding Kiev's treatment of the country's ethnically Hungarian
minority.

When Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed experts to examine
NATO's future, they noted that [a "drift toward NATO disunity ... must
be seen as a strategic rather than merely tactical or optical
problem]{.underline}." [To date, **[allies]{.mark}** have
**[lacked]{.mark}** the [**political will** or **legal

In practice, NATO needs a new mechanism to hold members accountable when
there is democratic backsliding and when the principles of the
Washington Treaty, NATO's founding document, are violated. Celeste
Wallender, President Obama's special assistant to the president and
senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the National
Security Council, argues persuasively for several measures here. As she
and others have noted, [[**NATO currently has no options** to]{.mark}
suspend, expel, or [penalize a]{.mark} NATO [member]{.mark}, for example
Hungary, [for violating]{.mark} a core tenet of the alliance's

**Morton 18** Christopher A. Morton, Major, United States Marine Corps,

State University, "How Does United States Security Assistance Affect
Host Nation Democratization?" MA thesis, June 2018,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1060022.pdf> /GoGreen!

This thesis asked the question: How does United States security
assistance affect host nation democratization in U.S. Central Command's
area of responsibility? Does it support, undermine, or have minimal
effect on host nation democratization? I also investigated what U.S.
security assistance (SA) is typically designed to accomplish, how those
policies came about, and how influential U.S. SA is compared to other
factors. I analyzed evidence from case studies on Lebanon and Pakistan
to find supporting points and counterpoints for the three main
hypotheses: U.S. SA supports host nation democratization, U.S. SA
undermines host nation democratization, and U.S. SA has minimal
influence on host nation democratization compared to local and regional
actors. [I concluded that United States [security assistance has minimal
effect on]{.mark} host nation [democratization]{.mark}]{.underline}
compared to local and regional actors, [[**because** it is]{.mark}
designed and **[resourced primarily to accomplish security objectives,
not to drive]{.mark} enduring institutional
[reform]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Generally speaking, there is significantly more support for the third
hypothesis in the democratization literature. The case of Lebanon
supported the third hypothesis, but it also supported the "U.S. SA
supports host nation democratization" argument to a lesser degree. The
case of Pakistan supported the third hypothesis, but it also supported
the "U.S. SA undermines host nation democratization" argument to a
lesser degree. It is evident that U.S. SA is capable of affecting host
nation governance either positively or negatively, but U.S. SA is
significantly less influential than the host nation's local and regional
actors. This is an important point, because [a common argument
throughout the literature is the belief that U.S. SA is capable of
significantly impacting the host nation's institutions, political
culture, civil society, etc]{.underline}. My view is that [the influence
of U.S. SA on host nation governance is frequently over-stated; **but
[if it was resourced]{.mark} more heavily and designed [to
emphasize]{.mark} institutional [reform, then it could better
support]{.mark} host nation [democratization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Does U.S. SA support host nation democratization? I argue that [U.S. SA
**[can]{.mark}** help **[prevent democratic backsliding]{.mark}**, but
it does not actively support democratization in the way that it is
typically designed and resourced]{.underline}. If the United States
supported host nation democratization via its inspirational democratic
example (e.g., protecting human rights and individual liberties), then
U.S. SA was not the conduit for broadcasting the U.S. democratic
example. The evidence showed that two spikes in U.S. SA (between 0.8%
and 1.4% of host nation GDP) were quickly followed by increases in
democratization, but the largest spike in U.S. SA (upwards of 1.52% of
host nation GDP, and conditioned on democracy-related reforms) did not
increase democratization. 590 If aid conditionality supports host nation
democratization, then the case studies indicate that the threshold is
between 0.25% and 0.60% of host nation GDP.591 [The **[evidence]{.mark}
in both cases [supported]{.mark}** the idea that U.S. SA reinforced host
nation security, which helped **prevent** state collapse and
**democratic backsliding**]{.underline}, though it did not increase
democratization. If U.S. security sector assistance generally supports
host nation security sector reform---which then improved its
civil-military relations and democratic governance---then the case
studies indicated the threshold is above 10.5% of annual U.S. SA to the
host nation.592 Overall, the cases provided little evidence to support
this argument and plenty of evidence to undermine it.

Ample evidence---including the global surge in coups d'états and crises
of police violence from Brazil and Nigeria to the Philippines---shows
that dozens of countries must improve not only the "kinetic" capacities,
but also their governance, of police, military and other security
institutions. Yet a first outline last week of the new U.S. "initiative
for democratic renewal" omits any mention of this vital task. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies must re-shape
their assistance to support democracy]{.underline} and human rights. [In
some countries---for example Egypt and Uganda---U.S. security sector
assistance has helped to consolidate authoritarianism. Current trends
risk exacerbating the problem in a "race to the bottom" among the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Russia and
China]{.underline}.

[U.S. policies too often set aside]{.underline} the nation's [commitment
to democratic values on a flawed assumption that this is necessary to
advance U.S. interests amid great-power competition. Yet **democratic
backsliding** and **authoritarianism** create long-term risks of
**violence**, **instability** and **extremism**]{.underline}. Even
measured by the narrower metric of strategic military alliances, these
risks weaken U.S. security interests. Serious democratic backsliding
preceded Turkey's decision to purchase one or more Russian S-400 missile
defense systems. Democratic backsliding in the Philippines weakened the
U.S.-Philippine security relationship to the point of endangering the
agreement that has enabled a U.S. troop presence in the Philippines.
Worldwide, democratic deficiencies help push countries into the arms of
China or Russia.

How **[[Security Assistance]{.mark} Can Hurt Democracies]{.underline}**

The United States and others have historically ignored the significance
of effective security sector governance for consolidating democracy.
Donor countries have treated security sector reform as a technical
problem, rather than a political endeavor that can change power dynamics
and the political trajectory in a country. The [[**recent coups** in
**Sudan**, **Mali**, **Guinea**, **Myanmar** and **Chad** show]{.mark}
how an emboldened military and weak or absent civilian control over
security forces may **[not simply weaken democracy, but end
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To promote peace, stability, democracy and U.S. strategic objectives,
the United States helps violence-afflicted nations with assistance to
strengthen civil society, political parties, and legislative oversight.
Yet the people overthrowing civilian, elected rule in Chad, Guinea and
Mali this year were military officers who had been direct beneficiaries
of U.S. training. This agonizing irony underscores that we can no longer
neglect the central importance for democracy of helping nations improve
security sector governance.

[In these latest coups and in other examples, we see how **security
assistance [itself can undermine democracy]{.mark}** [when it]{.mark}
effectively "[super-sizes]{.mark}" a vulnerable nation's [security
services relative to]{.mark} weaker democratic, [civilian
institutions]{.mark} that are meant to control them]{.underline}. [Where
governments lack funding and capacities to meet populations' basic
needs, this danger skyrockets. Yet in too many cases---Egypt, Mali,
Niger, the Philippines and others---U.S. and other security assistance
has led to significant increases in military and security budgets at the
expense of strengthening other critical services]{.underline}.
[Ill-balanced security assistance especially risks weakening democratic
governance where it has backed major counterterrorism
operations]{.underline}.

Egypt is a prime example. In the past four years, U.S. bilateral
assistance to Egypt has been \$1.4 billion per year, most of that to pay
for Egypt to buy U.S.-made weapons. While this assistance has not
enabled Egypt to end the threats from its terrorist groups in Sinai, it
has buttressed the military regime, which now controls much of the
country's economy. Under current law and policy, only \$300 million of
the United States' bilateral aid in FY 2021 was subject to being
withheld by the State Department if Egypt failed to meet certain human
rights and rule-of-law standards. The threat to withhold 23 percent of
its assistance is far too little to show a powerful U.S. commitment to
democracy, rights and governance. It reflects the relatively small
amount that the United States has invested in promoting good governance.

President Biden often has said, "Don\'t tell me what you value. Show me
your budget, and I\'ll tell you what you value." This month, the Biden
administration proposed spending up to \$424.4 million next year on
programs to strengthen democracy---an initiative that hardly compares to
U.S. spending of roughly \$18-20 billion each recent year on security
assistance.

A Race to the Bottom

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [current approach
[risks]{.mark} becoming [a **race to the bottom** with **China** and
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In recent years, countries receiving
security assistance have [encouraged **bidding wars**]{.mark} among
Russia, China, and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to seek
the most attractive possible aid packages, including
weapons]{.underline}. [In fear of losing leverage over partners such as
Philippines or Nigeria , the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has participated]{.underline}. This allows authoritarian or
authoritarian-leaning governments to procure weapons and other equipment
and training for their militaries or police with little or no
requirement for human rights or security governance improvements. In
some cases, the fear of losing leverage may be unwarranted: After his
initial flirtation with a closer relationship with China, Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte understood that China's threat to his
interests is very real and shifted back to the U.S. camp.

This means the United States has compromised on democracy and human
rights for, at best, short-term gains in relations with a given country.
In the long term, however, [this approach **undermines** **stability**
and **democracy**]{.underline}. [During the Cold War]{.underline}, the
U.S.'s primary goal of maintaining partnerships with governments in
Africa to prevent them from absorbing Soviet influences yielded a
similar approach. [A RAND study concluded that "**U.S. assistance**
appears likely to have **[increased]{.mark}** the incidence of **[civil
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this period, likely [by either
exacerbating domestic instabilities or provoking **[proxy
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}." There is no reason to believe that [a
21st-century **race to the bottom** with **Russia** and **China**, in
the interest of maintaining partnerships, will]{.underline} not [have
the **same results**]{.underline}.

**[We Can Do Better]{.underline}**

[The current U.S. approach to security sector assistance not only
**detracts** from]{.underline} President Biden's expressed goals of
[**consolidating democracy** [and]{.mark} **countering
authoritarianism**, it damages U.S. strategic interests in [**making it
easier** for **China** and **Russia** to engage with **authoritarian
regimes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the United States builds from last
week's Summit for Democracy, it needs to fully apply, and in some cases
expand, existing policies supporting democratic governance of the
security sector. [[**Key** steps]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[include]{.underline} these**[[:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

1\. [Keep promises to withhold security assistance from human rights
violators]{.underline}. Following through on existing legislation and
keeping promises [[to **withhold aid** to bad actors is **critical**
for]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
[[ability to **support democracy abroad** and]{.mark} for its
**[credibility]{.mark}** on the international stage]{.underline}. [U.S.
**[policy]{.mark} statements [describe conditionality]{.mark}** for
aid]{.underline}---democratic governance and adherence to human rights
norms---[that **often** is **ignored**]{.underline}. As in Egypt, the
United States often sustains security assistance to security partners
even when countries fall far short of critical governance and human
rights benchmarks. [**[Frequently]{.mark}**, senior U.S. officials may
**[threaten to withhold aid, but without follow-through]{.mark}**. [This
**needs to change** if **democracy consolidation** efforts are to **have

[Holding NATO's democratic backsliders to account is not without risk or
consequence, and the effort is even more complicated amid growing
competition between the West and authoritarian states including Russia
and China]{.underline}. The United States and NATO allies must carefully
navigate internal NATO challenges and avoid pushing some members further
from the alliance and closer to Russia. [Calling for the defense of
democracy **[could deepen fissures]{.mark}** between democratic and
illiberal states that are **not going away anytime soon**]{.underline}.

[An **[even greater risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} than Russian short-term
exploitation, [[**however**, is]{.mark} a possibility that]{.underline}
in 10 years' time the NATO alliance becomes unrecognizable---[a **hybrid
club** of autocratic, **[illiberal]{.mark}**, and liberal democratic
[states]{.mark} that, devoid of shared values, [**do not agree**
on]{.mark} security threats or **[areas for
coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}. In the long term, dictators tend to
maintain their power and legitimacy through strongmen power plays at
home and sometimes abroad. And almost always, they leave a legacy of
destruction, chaos, human rights violations, social strife, and other
grievances. They rarely contribute to international peace, stability,
and prosperity, which are the central objectives of an effective
security alliance.

The alliance should be a clear-eyed about this risk. [Like a cancer,
illiberal practices can **[metastasize if not addressed]{.mark}**.
Deepening autocracy among member states would be [a **death knell for
NATO**]{.mark} as an alliance]{.underline} that has provided protection
for the Euro-Atlantic community over the last 69 years.

**[[Concerns over]{.mark} democratic [backsliding can be raised
without]{.mark} grandstanding or high-minded [appeals that overly
chastise members]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Appeals for democratic
institutions and good governance should be investments in new security
initiatives and efforts that address the challenges all member states
face in the fields of cyber, terrorism, and hybrid warfare. All members
should be continuously convinced that their security and economic
prosperity lies most assuredly in the West. Making appeals for strong
democratic institutions and investing in security-based initiatives do
not have to be either-or efforts. Rather, NATO's best hope of succeeding
in a world of great power competition is as a security alliance of
democracies with transparent institutions, strong rule of law, and
leaders accountable to their citizens.

[ability to meet]{.underline} its [international

Today, though, ignoring democratic decline carries new risks. NATO's
adversaries have become increasingly skilled at taking advantage of and,

vulnerabilities. A compromised media environment allows disinformation
campaigns to flourish, while corruption opens space for Russian networks
to operate and gain influence. Moscow is also preying on the grievances
of racial and ethnic minorities in NATO member countries in order to
weaken national-level governance and cohesion.

In this context, [**democratic decline** has empowered the leaders of

Budapest blocked Ukraine's NATO Membership Action Plan and canceled

regarding Kiev's treatment of the country's ethnically Hungarian
minority.

When Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed experts to examine
NATO's future, they noted that [a "drift toward NATO disunity ... must
be seen as a strategic rather than merely tactical or optical
problem]{.underline}." To date, allies have lacked the political will or
legal instruments to effectively address in-house tensions and
divergences. The European Union can theoretically address democratic
backsliding through its rule of law mechanism and conditionality on its
funding. NATO, by contrast, has no legal provisions for suspending or
expelling an ally that violates the alliance's founding principles and
no financial carrots that might incentivize good behavior.

Good Intentions Won't Be Enough

In his first months in office, President Biden has already demonstrated
a desire to defend trans-Atlantic values. Recognizing the Armenian
genocide and adopting sanctions against Russia and China in coordination
with Europe are only the most recent examples. But how Biden plans to
translate this democratic agenda into concrete action in NATO remains
unclear. A mere declaration of good intentions won't be enough. As NATO
adapts for the next decade through the "NATO 2030" process, leaders
should seize the opportunity to adopt concrete solutions to defend
democratic values and ultimately uphold NATO's political cohesion.

A first and most essential step would be the adoption by NATO leaders of
a "political pledge" by which allies would recommit to abide by the
principles of the North Atlantic Treaty. These principles are often
mentioned in NATO's official communiques but in a cursory way,
reflecting the limited attention given to them. The NATO 2030 reflection
group promoted a similar idea with its proposed "code of good conduct."
Substance-wise, allies should pledge to uphold trans-Atlantic values ---
including democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law --- but also to
respect some principles of good behavior, such as consulting allies on
national decisions impacting trans-Atlantic security, refraining from
blocking matters external to NATO, and making good faith efforts to
settle any dispute with another ally. This "pledge" could be part of the
communique adopted by NATO leaders in Brussels or a stand-alone
document. At a minimum, these principles should be imbedded in the new
strategic concept that NATO is likely to launch at the June 14 summit.

Next, NATO should monitor individual allies' compliance with these
principles. Without any monitoring mechanism, a political declaration
risks becoming little more than a declaration of good intentions. First,
allies should be able to raise their concerns to the North Atlantic
Council or even at the ministerial level when they believe that a
serious violation of the "pledge" by a NATO member is occurring. Such
discussion would force that member to justify its decisions and create
political pressure in itself. Allies could also institute a regular
review of each country's compliance with NATO's core values and link it
to NATO's baseline requirements for national resilience. This periodic
report would be prepared by the International Secretariat under the
authority of the assistant secretary general for political affairs or
the deputy secretary general. NATO could build on existing metrics used
by the European Union or by nongovernmental organizations such as
Freedom House. Finally, joint NATO-European Union "resilience response
teams" could provide advice or assistance to allies, such as those new
NATO members in the Balkans, which might want help addressing their
societal vulnerabilities. Their efforts could draw on existing resources
such as NATO's centers of excellence on cyber, strategic communications,
and hybrid threats. Taken together, these procedures would provide the
basis for a periodic discussion on the political health of the alliance.

A last but challenging step would be to raise the political cost for
allies breaking the rules. This is admittedly the most difficult course
of action given NATO's consensus rule and the aforementioned lack of
legal mechanisms to sanction or expel. Here, NATO will need to be
creative and use a mixture of incentives and disincentives. In terms of
incentives, allies should make clear that decisions on NATO leadership
positions, facility placement, or ministerial locations will be
evaluated in light of the respect for NATO's values. If this fails to
induce better behavior, allies should move to publicize violations or
consider restrictive measures such as cancelling exercises or NATO
events or limiting participation in military planning or intelligence
sharing. For less sensitive measures such as cancelling visits of NATO
officials or appointing assistant secretary generals, these measures
could be implemented directly by the International Secretariat. For
other, more sensitive measures, the alliance might be forced to consider
a "consensus minus one" approach. Finally, additional pressure can be
brought through bilateral or European Union channels, thereby harnessing
other instruments of power such as financial incentives in support of
NATO objectives.

The Price of Unity

[Admittedly, pursuing a tougher course of action on values and
principles comes with risks]{.underline}. [Even measured steps could
create serious rifts among allies, with the potential of]{.underline}
paralyzing [\[halting\] the alliance]{.underline}. Because NATO operates
by consensus, any punitive action on an ally could provoke retaliatory
action on other NATO business. In reaction to Norway's stark criticisms
against the Portuguese and Greek regimes at a June 1971 foreign
ministers meeting, then-NATO Secretary General Manlio Brosio warned that
"if we undermine our solidarity, we run the risk of undermining the
substance of our alliance."

[**Overcoming this dilemma** between **[prioritizing values]{.mark}**
and **preserving unity** requires a graduated, collective, and
dispassionate approach]{.underline}. First, NATO will need to be
proportionate when dealing with an ally violating trans-Atlantic values.
Allies should start with discussions behind closed doors rather than
publicize the dispute. Open and frank dialogue among allies should
always be the first step before adopting restrictive measures. If NATO
moves too quickly or aggressively, it risks being counterproductive by
widening divisions in the alliance. At the end of the day, this
progressive approach [[should have a **deterrent effect**]{.mark} on
NATO countries, especially on those that value their membership in the
alliance and do not want to be singled out as "bad allies."]{.underline}

Second, NATO's response should be as collective and resolute as
possible. If pressure is applied by only a few NATO countries, the ally
in question may not take the warning seriously and could use the
divisions among allies to avoid accountability. If enough allies agree
to lean on a problematic NATO country, then [**[accepting short-term
disunity]{.mark}** for the sake of preserving trans-Atlantic values
could be **[worth it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In 2019, Turkey ultimately
decided to lift its longstanding veto to the defense plans of Poland and
the Baltic states because it was facing a growing and consistent
pressure from numerous allies, including the United States, the United
Kingdom, France, and Germany. The unity of the members of the Quad was
critical in that case and changed Ankara's strategic calculus.

Last but not least, all allies must be subject to the same objective
criteria and scrutiny. Otherwise, the backsliding ally will simply claim
it is being singled out and dismiss the charges. The International
Secretariat can be helpful here by conducting an impartial, evenhanded
assessment. Strong involvement of NATO's secretary general will also be
key in preserving political cohesion through this thorny process.
Recently, Secretary General Stoltenberg played an instrumental role in
easing the tensions between Greece and Turkey through the establishment
of a bilateral de-confliction mechanism in which he did not assess blame
but merely facilitated dialogue to be informed by international rules

**[counterproductive]{.mark}** approach with current and potential costs
to NATO's future]{.underline}. Here are three security-based reasons why
[[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[and NATO [**should care** about]{.mark} **democratic
[backsliding]{.mark}**, and actions the alliance can take to address
them]{.underline}.

1 [[Russia is **already** benefiting]{.mark} from [and]{.mark}
effectively [leveraging]{.mark} its relationships with Hungary and
Turkey to exacerbate **[discord]{.mark}** within Europe and
NATO]{.underline}. Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin see one another as
allies in their disdain for the European Union and Orbán has courted
Russian financial and political support as he builds an illiberal
democracy in Hungary. [Russian propaganda also finds fertile
ground]{.underline} in Hungarian media. A 2018 Senate Foreign Relations
Committee report noted that Russian state-owned media content "by
Sputnik and RT is widely referenced by pro-government news sources in
Hungary." The report cited Orbán as the EU and NATO's most supportive
leader of Putin's worldview and leadership. [Acting as the Russian
"camel's nose under the tent," Orbán is thwarting Ukraine and NATO's
partnership efforts]{.underline} by blocking the Ukraine-NATO Commission
from meeting at the upcoming summit.

[In Turkey, Erdoğan has rattled the NATO alliance]{.underline} by
pursuing a deal to purchase the S-400 missile system from Russia. In
addition to hurting NATO's ability to cooperate on security, the system
is also not compatible with NATO's defenses. [Through arms and energy
deals, Putin uses Turkey as a wedge to divide NATO]{.underline}.
Similarly, Erdoğan might see his deals with Putin as a way to free
Turkey from Western leverage, particularly as European states push back
on his brand of authoritarian politics by cutting EU pre-accession
funds. After winning the recent twin parliamentary and presidential
elections, an emboldened Erdoğan will likely become an even more
problematic partner for NATO.

[Other **[illiberal]{.mark}** and **populist** [governments]{.mark},
including Italy's new anti-establishment government, could **follow
suit** in enhancing their partnerships with Russia, [creating]{.mark}
future intelligence-sharing and [**cohesion** problems]{.mark} for the
alliance]{.underline}. President [Putin is building ties with illiberal
leaders across Europe]{.underline} while attacking fundamental elements
of Western democracies, including electoral process and open information
spaces.

2 [[There is a **strong link** between **demo**]{.mark}**cratic
governance** [and **security gains**]{.mark}. Liberal democracies have
**[historically]{.mark}** been less likely to experience intra- and
interstate conflict, generate refugees, and harbor violent extremists.
They are also better at maintaining transparent institutions, civilian
control of the military and intelligence services, and working together
on confidence-building measures, all of which are core features of
NATO's ability to collectively defend its members]{.underline}. On the
other hand, corruption and insecurity grow under politicized
institutions and poor rule of law. This hurts NATO's renewed efforts to
combat terrorism, as military and security communities have long
acknowledged the connection between corruption and the existence of
criminal networks, traffickers, and terrorists within state borders.

Corruption also opens space for Russian kleptocratic networks close to
Putin to operate and gain influence. For example, in 2014 Orbán awarded
Rosatom, a Russian state-owned nuclear company, the sole contract to
build two nuclear plants in Hungary in exchange for a 10 billion euro
loan from Moscow. The Hungarian parliament, dominated by Orbán's Fidesz
Party, then passed a rushed vote to keep data from the nuclear deal
confidential for 30 years in the name of "national security." The deal
diminished transparent economic competition within the European Union
and solidified Hungary and Russia's energy ties.

3 Distrust among allies hurts alliance interoperability. The PiS Party's
assault on independent media and the Constitutional Court, including
efforts last week to summarily force out 27 Polish Supreme Court
justices, have isolated Poland from France and Germany, diminishing
trust among the European nations. This could make it increasingly
difficult for Washington to gain consensus on joint decisions,
communications, and operations. If NATO is dedicated to building
resiliency along Russia's periphery by placing multi-national battalions
in Poland, then it should not ignore the accountable institutions that
would strengthen this joint effort.

NEXT STEPS FOR THE ALLIANCE

What can NATO do [[to **counter**]{.mark} **democratic
[backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline} within its ranks? After a troubling
G-7 meeting in Canada, the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels may be a
hair twisting exercise in alliance management. **[[Muted

address the anti-democratic trends tearing apart the fabric of Europe
and NATO. Strong actions and words are needed to counter this democratic
crisis]{.underline}.

Beyond its stabilizing effect on the broader continent, there is another
reason NATO\'s liberal democratic character came to matter: in the
absence of a shared external threat, [[the **binding force** of]{.mark}
liberal **[demo]{.mark}cratic [values]{.mark}** and institutions [has
become **essential** to the alliance\'s
**effectiveness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [NATO\'s ability to conduct
security operations depends on its political cohesion as much as its
members\' military capabilities. **[Few question NATO\'s cohesion when
Article 5]{.mark}** of its founding treaty **[is invoked]{.mark}** that
is, when an ally is directly attacked. Common external threats generate
unified responses]{.underline}. After 9/11, for example, NATO members
quickly joined the U.S. campaign against Talibanruled Afghanistan.

[[**However**, when]{.mark} the alliance faces a security issue that
does **[not]{.mark}** invoke **[Article 5]{.mark}**, alliance
**[cohesion is less certain]{.mark}** because members have different
priorities that guide their cost-benefit calculations. [In such
cases]{.mark}, **liberal commitment** to the rule of law has played an
**important role**]{.underline}. The alliance has proved cohesive when
acting outside Europe and when the stakes are well grounded in
international law, as was the case during its 2011 intervention in
Libya, which was backed by a un Security Council resolution.

[In other instances, when the alliance has faced more diffuse and
contested security challenges, a common [**commitment** to]{.mark}
liberal **[demo]{.mark}cratic [values]{.mark}** [has **proved even more
essential** to]{.mark} maintaining **[cohesion]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Consider the Balkans: in 1995, NATO conducted Operation Deliberate Force
to protect unsafe areas in Bosnia that had come under attack from ethnic
Serbian armed groups. And in 1999, it conducted another air operation
against the armed forces of what remained of Yugoslavia to prevent
military attacks on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. In both campaigns,
Article 5 did not apply because no NATO member had been directly
attacked. Nor was the alliance acting under a UN Security Council
resolution. These interventions tested the alliance\'s political
capacity, but ultimately, members coalesced around their common
commitment to human rights, a principle that would become enshrined in
international law in 2005 as \"the responsibility to protect\" (or R2P).
The alliance\'s ability to prevent mass atrocities in non-NATO states
was thus as much a product of its members\' values as it was a product
of their military assets.

[By contrast, when democratic values and institutions have cut in the
opposite direction, the alliance has been divided]{.underline}. Compare
NATO\'s interventions in the Balkan wars to its disunity over the 2003
U.S. invasion of Iraq. Although the Bush administration contended that
Iraq threatened global security by pursuing weapons of mass destruction
(an area of international law far better established than R2P), NATO was
far from unified on the matter. In fact, France and Germany were among
the most vocal critics of the invasion. Although NATO\'s interventions
in the Balkans had been legally problematic, the allies were still
united in pursuing them because of their shared commitment to human
rights. But [when it came to **Iraq**, **without a justification rooted
in liberalism**, **not all** of them were **willing to support** an
intervention **beyond** the purview of **Article 5**]{.underline}.

Landscape of the security assistance system today

Security assistance has been a critical foreign policy tool for
decades.24 Today, the United States provides assistance to a range of
allies and partners to achieve its security goals. The primary objective
of U.S. security assistance is to advance U.S. national and global
security by empowering allies and partners to effectively confront
shared security challenges.

The State Department system

The State Department provides security assistance primarily through the
FMF program, an account with about \$6 billion annually for military
equipment and training to partners.25 The State Department's other
authorities receive about half that amount, averaging around \$3 billion
annually for professional military education, peacekeeping,
counternarcotics, and other programs.26

**\[Figure 2 OMITTED\]**

The State Department's security assistance funds, primarily FMF, provide
little flexibility for diplomats. More than 80 percent of FMF flows to
Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, the top three recipients of U.S. security
aid.27 After these partners, the State Department is generally left with
about \$1 billion to distribute among the remaining countries around the
world, though most of this founding is already earmarked by Congress for
specific countries.28 While State Department officials could in theory
request more funds or flexibility, the department's legislative affairs
office has often failed to even ask Congress for more resources or
flexibility. To that point, funding for the State Department has
declined in real terms---compared with significant growth in the
Pentagon budget---since 9/11.29

State Department security assistance programs

Foreign Military Financing (FMF)

International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE)

Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR)

Peacekeeping Operations (PKO)

International Military Education and Training (IMET)

There are several challenges with today's State Department security
assistance:

It's not flexible. The majority of FMF's funds are earmarked in
appropriations for specific partners, such as Egypt and Israel. The
top-down direction of FMF funding leaves very little available funding
for State Department programmers to grant to countries in the event of
crises or new political dynamics. This makes it difficult for the State
Department to reallocate significant enough funds to provide useful
security assistance in times of crisis, especially when compared with
some of the DOD's resources and more flexible authorities. Senior State
Department officials have warned, "The more money and more authority you
move out of traditional accounts we have used for decades to work with
our partners, the more you lose the ability to balance."30 For example,
after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the State Department wanted to
provide urgent security assistance but was only able to reallocate a few
million dollars from its FMF account.31

This lack of flexibility stands in stark contrast to allocations of DOD
resources, some of which are granted to combatant commands and security
cooperation officers in country to decide when and to whom funding is
granted based on more immediate security considerations.32 As a result
of this lack of flexibility, the State Department is largely seen as
slow and bureaucratic and unable to respond to security crises within
the U.S. government. But the State Department is no slower or faster
than the DOD. Often, the State Department is seen as being slow in
acting when it is actually holding on a decision due to policy reasons
or due to congressional concerns. This was the case, for instance, in
providing security assistance to partly fund Pakistan's acquisition of
additional F-16s.33

Bureaucratic incentives favor the status quo. The State Department's
regional-functional bureaucratic divide---a perennial problem within the
agency---inhibits its effectiveness in managing security assistance. In
practice, the State Department's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs
shares decision-making authority on security assistance with regional
bureaus that are loath to cut funding for the countries under their
purview. Many regional bureaus also needlessly maintain their own
separate security assistance offices, reducing their reliance on the
Political-Military Affairs Bureau and complicating internal
policymaking. Critiques of the State Department's internal disfunction
are valid, and lessons learned within the U.S. government and the DOD
about how best to implement security assistance should be incorporated
into State Department reforms.

The State Department's leadership has in the past refused to ask
Congress for more money for security assistance. This has created an odd
juxtaposition where Pentagon officials and military officers plead with
Congress for more money for the State Department, while State Department
officials do not.34 The department's silence, however, was largely due
to fears that a conservative Congress would not increase the State
Department's overall budget but instead take funds from other accounts
such as development, undercutting the agency's other missions.

To address these challenges, there should be a review of the security
assistance structure at the State Department to centralize
decision-making in order to inform better, more coherent policy that
aligns with the secretary of state's objectives for U.S. foreign policy.
The reforms should also build more agility and flexibility into the
State Department's FMF program, in part by reducing the influence of
some regional offices that can distort broader foreign policy goals.

The DOD system

While the DOD has long played a role in implementing security
assistance---usually as directed by the State Department---the provision
of expansive authorities to the DOD, enabling it to manage its own
assistance programs, is relatively new. Beginning in the 1980s, the DOD
was granted funds to conduct its own security assistance
programs---separate from the State Department---under Title 10, with
programs for counternarcotics, nonproliferation, and counterterrorism
activities.35 After the 9/11 attack, the Bush administration sought to
expand the DOD's role to focus on counterterrorism and expanding partner
special operations capabilities. In the following years, Congress more
than doubled the number of DOD security assistance programs, granting
new authorities and resources to the executive branch to bolster
counterterrorism efforts and combat emerging threats.36

There are several challenges of this duplicative security assistance
system at the DOD:

The DOD's authorities duplicate authorities originally granted to the
State Department. Congress originally granted long-term efforts to
develop another country's security forces to the State Department and
put these efforts under the purview of diplomats. But in the post-9/11
security environment, rather than fix the State Department's lack of
resources to handle counterterrorism issues, appropriators gave the
funds to the DOD, contributing to more bifurcation of security
assistance policy. This was exemplified by the 2006 creation of Section
1206: a \$350 million annual authority for the secretary of defense to
support counterterrorism efforts and assist coalition partners. Though
it required cooperation with the State Department, it was explicitly
designed to empower the DOD, in part because some DOD officials thought
the State Department was too slow and lacking expertise to carry out
counterterrorism activities.37 In 2014, a Congressional Research Service
report found that "government personnel state that Section 1206 has been
used as a substitute for FMF, especially in the early years, given what
many analysts believe is a shortage of FMF funds to meet legitimate
foreign defense equipment needs."38

[[**Congressional barriers** exacerbated]{.mark} the DOD-State
Department [imbalance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} 2011
**[B]{.mark}udget [C]{.mark}ontrol [A]{.mark}ct** [and a]{.mark}
Republican-controlled **[Congress skeptical of]{.mark} the
[State]{.mark} Department** [made **giving more resources**]{.mark} to
the department [a **nonstarter**]{.mark}]{.underline}.39 Senior DOD
officials urged Congress to grant the agency new authorities, such as in
a 2008 House Armed Services Committee hearing with the secretary of
defense and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.40 Faced with these
constraints, the Obama administration opted to create more authorities
at the DOD through the annual must-pass National Defense Authorization
Act (NDAA). [Meanwhile, the **[Senate]{.mark}** **Foreign Relations**
[and **House** **Foreign Affairs**]{.mark} committees, [with
jurisdiction]{.mark} only [over]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}**
Department's security assistance programs, **[did little]{.mark}** to
correct the imbalance]{.underline}.41 According to one study before the
recent consolidation efforts, the DOD managed 48 out of 50 new programs
created after the 9/11 attacks.42 Of the 107 existing security
assistance programs today, the DOD manages 87---a whopping 81 percent.43

DOD officials can work around the State Department's diplomats. In part
due to restrictions from the Budget Control Act and with new programs at
the DOD, Pentagon officials had more flexibility on security assistance
programs than their State Department counterparts. The DOD had budgetary
space to reallocate significant funds from the substantial Pentagon
budget to respond to sudden emergencies or new crises, something that is
virtually impossible for the State Department, making the DOD often the
lead actor in a crisis.44 Regional combatant commands aggressively
sought more resources from Congress to conduct their own security
assistance programs, giving them added flexibility to work with partners
in the field that their State Department counterparts lacked.45 A
Government Accountability Office report found that 56 DOD security
assistance programs do not require any involvement from the State
Department.46

Temporary programs become permanent. The majority of the new DOD
security assistance authorities were premised as temporary, operational
programs, designed to tackle immediate threats and challenges.47 But in
practice, many programs have endured. Once a multiyear,
multimillion-dollar program is established, it has a tendency to become
entrenched, becoming a permanent assistance program with its own
invested bureaucracy to sustain and expand it.48 The Section 1206
authority exemplifies this phenomenon: A 2017 DOD inspector general
report found that "DoD officials stated that the temporary nature of the
authority made it infeasible to commit the resources necessary to
effectively manage Section 1206 as a 'program'"---despite the fact that
it was annually authorized and funded for 10 years until fiscal year
2015. Some \$2.2 billion was appropriated for Section 1206 before it
became law. Section 333 funding now replicates many of the same
functions today.

The DOD's duplicative security assistance programs complicate overall
foreign policymaking. Reforming security assistance by centralizing
resources at the State Department---and coupling the move with necessary
reforms at the State Department---would go a long way toward improving
this policy process.

DOD security assistance programs

Assessing total DOD funding for security assistance programs remains a
challenge.49 Today, in addition to implementing State Department
security assistance, the DOD operates a range of its own security
assistance programs. This contributes to a system that is less coherent,
less integrated, less transparent, and less subject to effective
congressional oversight.

DOD security assistance programs related to train and equip include:50

Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (ASFF)

Past attempts to reform the system

Recent efforts to reform the security assistance architecture tend to
get bogged down by the complexity of the current system. This has led to
an inevitable focus on incremental tweaks that address tactical-level
concerns. These weedy discussions, while useful, often take the current
structure of the U.S. security assistance system as a given---and
therefore, do not address the broader strategic and budgetary issues and
imbalance between diplomacy and defense. Furthermore, policymakers and
[**[politicians]{.mark}** often **[get lost in]{.mark} the
[techni]{.mark}cal nature** [of]{.mark} these
[discussions]{.mark}]{.underline}, lack broader historical context,
[[and are **easily persuaded** by **officials** with a stake in]{.mark}
largely **[preserving the s]{.mark}tatus [quo]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
in protecting their offices, [who tout the complexity of the challenge;
[as a result, they **quickly lose interest in
reform**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A new administration should be wary of
these past mistakes when embarking on suggested reforms in this report.

Capitol Hill** say]{.mark} they [need to]{.mark} be **[tilt]{.mark}ed
[back]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"It's time for a reckoning," Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman
Robert Menendez, D-N.J., said at a recent hearing, where the State
Department offered its reform ideas. [**[Powerful lawmakers]{.mark}**
indicated they were **[supportive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and Menendez
said he will spearhead legislation in the coming months with the panel's
top Republican, Sen. Jim Risch of Idaho.

The State Department's proposals range from elevating human rights
concerns to offering countries more attractive financing for weapons
purchases.

The potential for a shakeup comes as the Biden administration rushes aid
to Ukraine following Russia's invasion. The administration had already
committed about \$2 billion in weapons and other aid to Kyiv, when
Congress recently enacted a \$13.6 billion package for the region, with
\$3.5 billion for Ukraine.

The U.S. government has spent hundreds of billions of dollars over the
last two decades for programs that provide security assistance and
cooperation to foreign countries, according to the Congressional
Research Service. In particular, this work has become a core mission for
the Pentagon since 9/11.

As building up foreign forces in Iraq and Afghanistan became key to
post-9/11 national security plans, Congress gave the Defense Department
new authorities and funding. From 2001 to 2022, the budgets for those
programs tripled to \$18 billion. The proportion managed by the Pentagon
grew from 20% to slightly more than half.

[Critics of the tilt toward the Pentagon say it **relies too much on the
military** to solve foreign policy problems **better handled by**, or at
least coordinated with, trained **diplomats**]{.underline}.

And [at the center of the current conversation are some high-profile
failures of recent years]{.underline}. Despite billions of dollars spent
on the Iraqi security forces, for instance, many of them collapsed in
the face of attacks from the Islamic State group in 2014. And \$125
billion spent to bolster Afghan security forces didn't stop the same
from happening under Taliban pressure last year.

At the recent hearing, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said the \$87 billion
in U.S. security assistance to Afghanistan "went up in smoke overnight"
when the Afghan military collapsed, calling it "an extraordinary waste
of money.

"Clearly there is something very wrong with the way in which we are
flowing military assistance to partner countries, especially in
complicated war zones," Murphy said.

A diplomatic wish list

The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's recent hearing aired a
long-running debate over the State-DoD divide. The assistant secretary
of state for political-military affairs, Jessica Lewis, who previously
worked for Menendez as his panel's staff director, detailed the
department's suggestions for change.

The State Department is asking for more money to improve its workforce,
but is primarily seeking process-oriented reforms.

Ever since the Pentagon's resources mushroomed after 9/11, the State
Department says it has lacked flexibility. Because of the way aid has
historically been structured, Lewis said, nearly all of the \$7 billion
in assistance her bureau gets annually is bound by congressional
directives; after Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Iraq are accounted for, only
\$1.8 billion is left for the rest of the world.

State is now asking for flexibility in peacekeeping operations, and for
the funding of some foreign military financing loans to be appropriated
by region rather than country.

Lewis also wants to break countries of the "latent expectancy" they'll
receive aid in the U.S. budget every year. That could have a
trickle-down effect on which countries get to buy their equipment of
choice with American dollars.

Another recommendation is to elevate the goal ― in Washington's dealings
with allies over aid ― of making foreign forces more effective,
transparent and accountable, and building their capacity. That aligns
with Lewis' argument that [while **security assistance** is an
**important** alliance-building tool in America's competition with
authoritarian Russia and China, that contest is fundamentally about
**democratic values** and norms]{.underline}.

["We must keep the importance of]{.underline} security sector
**[governance]{.underline}** and respect for universal human rights
[front and center as we consider where to provide **security
assistance**]{.underline}, and as we engage partner nations' security
institutions and empower them toward modernization, accountability and
reform," she said.

When it comes to acquisition, the DoD needs to better manage requests
from allies for equipment outside existing departmental programs, and
foreign military financing must provide more competitive loan options,
Lewis said. She also said the State Department needs an improved
contracting process to expedite urgent arms transfers.

The State Department is asking for more money to also retain and hire
experts to better collaborate with the DoD. The State Department has a
"political-military workforce that numbers in the low hundreds," in
contrast with the Pentagon's security cooperation workforce of 20,000,
Lewis said.

"While **[State]{.underline}** actively supports many DoD security
sector assistance activities, the Department [currently **lacks
sufficient staff and bandwidth** to fully participate in DoD planning
processes and to thoroughly review proposed programs, including when
some authorities include 'joint formulation' requirements]{.underline},"
Lewis said in a statement.

[The State Department hasn't framed its proposals as a competition with
the Pentagon, but it is asking ― in the name of efficiency and
coordination ― to expand requirements that the DoD get State Department
"concurrence" --- or approval --- before it executes security assistance
programs]{.underline}.

Concurrence requirements already apply to 25 such DoD efforts, but not
all in existence, as the State Department would like.

While Lewis did not name specific programs as targets, one that offers
the Pentagon broad latitude and could see scrutiny is the 127 Echo
program, which funds surrogate forces in counterterrorism missions,
often in Africa. The fund has quadrupled to \$25 million since its
inception in 2005.

**[[Bipart]{.mark}isan [support]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Any effort to uproot authorities and funding, to then shift them toward
the State Department, would likely face an uphill fight with the
Pentagon and potentially with the Senate Armed Services Committee. The
committee has on its side the only reliable annual legislative vehicle
in the National Defense Authorization Act.

Max Bergmann, a former State Department official who authored security
assistance reform recommendations last year, said efforts to shift
greater authority to the State Department will succeed only if the White
House prioritizes them. In a high-stakes competition with China, the
U.S. can't afford for parallel security-assistance bureaucracies to
undermine statecraft, he said.

"What is critical is that we have full control over that lever, and not
have it be a bureaucratic mess where one hand doesn't know what the
other is doing and it's difficult for any senior policymaker in the
White House to know what the hell's going on," said Bergmann, now a
senior fellow at Center for American Progress.

Meanwhile, [members [of the **Senate Foreign Relations Committee** on
**both sides of the aisle**]{.mark} are generally **supportive of
shifts**, arguing for an overhaul of the current setup]{.underline}.

"[As the **Defense** Department continues efforts to **cut the State
Department out** of **security cooperation**]{.underline}, we've seen a
greater focus on short-term tactical capabilities than on sustainable
forces aligned with strategic foreign policy," [Risch said. "We must
address governance challenges like corruption in all our
activities]{.underline}, and we need to professionalize our security
assistance workforce."

Likewise, a congressional source familiar with [Menendez]{.underline}'s
thinking said [the chairman wants an **integrated** approach to foreign
assistance that spans the U.S. government, but is **led by the State
Department**]{.underline}. The idea is to help countries holistically
and not measure success in the numbers of units trained or rifles sent.

"You could do these short-term, tactical things for years and the
overall security situation in a country doesn't improve because you have
governance problems, corruption problems, and all the other things that
alienate a populace from its government and \[fosters\] a terrorist
group," said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

Some [concerns have surfaced **[in the House as
well]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [After a series of coups in Mali and other
Sahel countries]{.underline}, which were carried out by American- and
French-trained and -equipped personnel, [House Foreign Affairs Committee
Chairman]{.underline} Gregory [Meeks]{.underline}, D-N.Y., [and other
lawmakers]{.underline} wrote to President Joe Biden on Feb. 4 to
[express alarm]{.underline}.

"We strongly recommend your administration focus on identifying and
addressing the complex challenges surrounding conflict and violence,
improve the efficacy of assistance designed to reform national security
sectors and institutions, and --- given the anti-democratic trends in
the region --- strengthen governance, civil society, and accountability
based on rigorous conflict analysis and diplomacy," said the letter, led
by Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Calif.

fundamental to any effort to reempower the State Department and would
eventually improve interagency functionality by resulting in
better-managed policymaking. The costs of moving authorities would be
well worth the improvements in overall U.S. policy by making it more
coherent, less wasteful, and more effective.

[Build in **[a]{.mark}ssessment, [m]{.mark}onitoring, [and
e]{.mark}valuation** programs]{.underline} at the outset of security
assistance programs

[Effective monitoring mechanisms [should be **built in** from the outset
**in reforming**]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department's security
assistance programs]{.underline}. In the current system, there is little
evidence of what works or what does not in terms of improving a partner
country's capacity or will to achieve shared security objectives. Some
reforms to DOD security assistance programs were an important step
toward building assessment, monitoring, and evaluation into the DOD's
security assistance programs.95 Similarly, recent efforts to reform
monitoring in the State Department's Peacekeeping Operations accounts
have had notable success. These reforms should be copied and mandated
for all programs conducted by the State Department and the DOD moving
forward. [**[A]{.mark}ssessment, [m]{.mark}onitoring, [and
e]{.mark}valuation** programs [should be]{.mark} regularized and
[**aggregated** in order to be useful]{.mark} for U.S. officials
implementing security assistance programs]{.underline}.96 This will be a
significant undertaking, and so building up a professional workforce
that can effectively monitor and evaluate security assistance programs
must be a significant component and priority in personnel reforms at the
State Department and the DOD. Further reforms should be considered, such
as mandating that a small portion of funds for each security assistance
program be set aside for assessment, monitoring, and evaluation
purposes.

Congress should modify oversight structures to reduce stovepiping

Reforms to the security assistance framework are often slowed by
congressional equities that remain stovepiped and unwilling to enable
resource sharing and coordination between departments. The House and
Senate Armed Services committees, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee should consider
working together to establish a joint subcommittee, working group, or
task force on security assistance policy that would be responsible for
the oversight of all forms of security sector assistance. Great strides
were made in the Obama administration to increase State Department-DOD
collaboration and integration, only to run into challenges when engaging
a Congress that remained stuck in its agency oversight stovepipes.

Congress should also hold regular oversight hearings to hold the
executive branch accountable for developing a coherent security
assistance policy. It should require an annual report to track where
funds are being allocated and to articulate how U.S. security assistance
efforts support broader U.S. foreign policy goals and objectives. This
will not only provide needed transparency and accountability, but also
put political and public pressure on the Political-Military Affairs
Bureau.

Conclusion

[[Moving resources to]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department to
conduct security assistance [would result in **more effective aid** that
is **less likely to be wasted**]{.mark} or flow to abusive partners. It
would also [reduce **unnecessary bureaucracy**]{.mark} from the current
system]{.underline}. This would be an important step toward undoing the
militarization of U.S. foreign policy and would give an important
foreign policy tool back to American diplomats.

The new administration [should]{.underline} move quickly to
[**consolidate** security assistance resources under the State
Department]{.underline}, with accompanying reforms to the bureaucracy
and workforce that handles these issues. Congress should support this
realignment and transfer the necessary authorities and resources from
the DOD to the State Department.

/GoGreen!

Yet, security assistance and cooperation remains vitally important and
is appealing, especially when options like large-scale U.S. military
operations do not make strategic sense. This helps to explain the
numerous new authorities that consecutive administrations have requested
and Congress has created. The increase in new authorities has
contributed to confusion about the purposes of different programs.
Moreover, programs are sometimes chosen based on which authorities are
available or most flexible rather than on the authority best suited to
the task at hand. Finally, **[[most]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the
[[**new programs** are housed at]{.mark} the **[Pentagon]{.mark}** and
**[not]{.mark}** the **[State]{.mark}** Department. [As a
result]{.mark}, programs are [deployed to meet **Defense requirements as
opposed to**]{.mark} implemented in a way that furthers
**[broader]{.mark} foreign policy [objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The [bottom line]{.underline} is that [more is not necessarily
better]{.underline}. That goes for the number of authorities and the
level of assistance or cooperation provided to U.S. partners.

The spate of **[new authorities]{.underline}** has
**[[exacerbate]{.underline}]{.mark}**d [both **[imbalances]{.mark}**
between the **Pentagon** and the **State** Department [and **conflicts**
among]{.mark} the **objectives** that [**assistance** and
**coop**]{.mark}**eration** are used to achieve]{.underline}.

So what is to be done? While there is no singular solution to the
challenges we identify in our report, we offer a few recommendations to
members of Congress and the executive branch who want to reform this
effort.

First, the executive and legislative branches must work together to
consolidate and rationalize existing authorities. The Department of
Defense (DoD) and State [[should]{.mark} develop coordinated reform
proposals that [**consolidate** **DoD** authorities and
**transfer**]{.mark}]{.underline} the appropriate ones **[[to
State]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Congress is the ultimate arbiter when it
comes to passing legislation to consolidate authorities, but it also
could play an important role by holding hearings to help inform the
coordination process between DoD and State.

Second, it is incumbent on policymakers to candidly prioritize goals,
delineate where they are willing to accept risks, and plan ahead to
mitigate anticipated consequences associated with these risks. This is
best done through a regional framework. The National Security Council
(NSC) should direct representatives from State and DoD to produce joint
reviews of U.S. security assistance and cooperation in their respective
regions.

Third, Congress can help to improve interagency coordination and enhance
State's capacity to manage security assistance programs. To improve
awareness and coordination, a new mechanism should be created to allow
the relevant personnel from State and DoD to serve in six- to 12-month
rotations at the other's agency. [To [augment its capacity to
oversee]{.mark} security assistance, the State Department will
[also]{.mark} need to [hire more people]{.mark} and reform its personnel
management practices]{.underline}. Foreign service officers should be
trained to manage security assistance programs and incentivized to
choose this as a career track. State would [also benefit from a larger
civil service cadre with the requisite financial, legal, legislative,
and programmatic skills]{.underline}.

Expand and train the security assistance workforce at the State
Department

[To administer such a massive expansion in security assistance funding,
the State Department will need significantly more qualified people
focused on this work. [The]{.mark} proposed **[funding shift]{.mark}**
should [involve]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department
**[incorporating DOD]{.mark} civilian [employees]{.mark}** [who]{.mark}
currently [work on security assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
workforce development plan should be a focus of the security assistance
structure across the U.S. government, and it should look at where the
State Department could detail officials from the DOD as Foggy Bottom
ramps up its capacity. The workforce reform should [[also]{.mark}
include the following changes:]{.underline}

[Conduct an overall review of the existing security assistance workforce
and make significant [reforms]{.mark} to [improve]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department's **[capacity]{.mark}** to manage new
resources that are transferred to the department]{.underline}.

[[**Hire** more employees]{.mark} charged with overseeing security
assistance policy]{.underline}, acknowledging that it will take time to
build a robust security assistance workforce.

[Direct resources to [**professionalize** the]{.mark} security
assistance [workforce]{.mark} at the State Department. Similar reforms
were mandated for DOD officials working on security cooperation at the
Pentagon in 2017]{.underline}.85 Proponents of the changes at the DOD
noted that it would "establish a pool of talented and experienced
employees from which future senior leaders in security cooperation will
be selected, mentored and given an opportunity to guide the
enterprise."86 [This specialized workforce should extend beyond the DOD
[so]{.mark} that **[State]{.mark}** Department officials can [benefit
from established knowledge]{.mark} of the security assistance
landscape]{.underline}.

These reforms are critical because without an effective and
well-resourced workforce to administer these policy changes at the State
Department, the DOD will likely be able to continue to set policy and
the terms under which it is implemented due to bigger budgets and
manpower at the Pentagon.

[**How to fix** the system]{.underline}

To change this, [there is a **straightforward solution:** **give the
State Department the money**]{.underline}. A new administration and new
[Congress [should **redirect**]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
[**[all]{.mark}** of the **[DOD's security assistance]{.mark}**
resources [to]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department and build up the
State Department's capacity to administer assistance]{.underline}.
Clearly, such a transfer must be [[**accompanied** by **swift**]{.mark}
and far-reaching internal [reforms]{.mark} at the State Department [to
**enable this expanded role**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but such reforms are
long overdue and should not deter this bold step.

This proposal [would]{.underline} help to [**fix** many of the
challenges of a **duplicative, bifurcated** security assistance
system]{.underline} that spans multiple U.S. agencies and involves
thousands of personnel. It would [enable more coherent overall policy on
American security assistance, allowing aid decisions to be guided
by]{.underline} general foreign policy [concerns and]{.underline}
current [priorities]{.underline}. It would better allow for [ensuring
that U.S. assistance comports with]{.underline} American [values,
including]{.underline} working closely with [democratic
states]{.underline} and prioritizing respect for human rights.

This report focuses on the relatively new development of parallel
security assistance authorities at the DOD that mirror the State
Department's traditional authority for long-term capacity building of
partner forces to achieve U.S. foreign policy goals. The State
Department's FMF account is the primary vehicle for this; it receives
about \$6 billion annually, about 80 percent of which goes to Israel,
Egypt, and Jordan. The remaining \$1 billion of FMF is also heavily
earmarked, limiting the State Department's discretion.16 The DOD's
security cooperation programs, which are challenging to track due to
frequent changes in accounts and programs, received about \$2 billion
total last year.17 The DOD accounts that most closely mirror the State
Department's FMF program, including the Section 333 capacity-building
authority, the Maritime Security Initiative, and several other programs,
received \$1.3 billion in fiscal year 2020.18

[Funding associated with long-term capacity building of partner
militaries]{.underline}---such as the DOD's funding to build partner
capacity through Section 333---[should be the domain of the State
Department]{.underline}. DOD assistance accounts that currently fund
U.S. involvement in endless wars or prolonged security assistance
engagements meant to build the capacity over partners over the long
term, such as the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund (\$4.2 billion), the
Counter-ISIS Train and Equip Fund (\$1.2 billion), and funding for
Ukraine (\$250 million), should be reviewed with an eye to move the
programs and funding to the State Department.19 Combined with Section
333 funds (\$1.2 billion), this would result in a transfer of about \$7
billion annually, more than doubling the State Department's total
security assistance resources. While it makes sense for the DOD to
control authorities to provide operational assistance when engaged in
combat, U.S. policy in Afghanistan has moved toward long-term projects
of building up the security forces, which would point toward a larger
role for the State Department.20 The other programs are also more
aligned with broader foreign policy goals of long-term capacity building
of partners.

While there are times when it is appropriate for the DOD to have the
authority to directly provide assistance to a partner, these programs
should be exclusive to when the United States is at war and fighting
side by side with allied or partner forces. In these cases, such as in
active combat in Iraq or Afghanistan, it may make sense for the Pentagon
to have its own authorities to assist foreign partners. But
**[[outside]{.underline}]{.mark}** these [[**wartime**
situations]{.mark}, and especially in light of today's efforts to end
the forever wars, the **[State]{.mark}** Department [is **fully able**
to]{.mark} oversee and [manage]{.mark} the bulk of U.S. security
assistance programs]{.underline}.

While this report calls for realigning U.S. assistance toward democratic
allies and partners, it avoids diving into the specific policy debates
over what countries should or should not receive security assistance.
Those are obviously critical foreign policy debates, but the authors
focus on improving the ability of U.S. officials to make coherent policy
decisions by first creating an effective management and organizational
structure of security assistance. This will also require major reform to
the State Department's own security assistance programs, which routinely
and without deliberation provide billions in aid to non-democracies.
Security assistance should not be a diplomatic handout or entitlement;
it should serve U.S. foreign policy and be flexible enough in its
administration to align with U.S. foreign policy objectives and values.
That not only requires consolidating security assistance programs in one
place, but also demands significant reforms to the decision-making
structure and security assistance system at the State Department.

The Biden-Harris administration should therefore make rebalancing and
reforming security assistance---and restoring the lead to the State
Department---an immediate priority, working with Congress and pushing
for shifting resources from the DOD to the State Department in its first
budget.

Anticipating and rebutting arguments against reform

Of course, reforming the security assistance system will not be easy and
will encounter challenges. But these would be outweighed by the benefits
of a more coherent and effective security assistance policy guided by
the State Department. Anticipated challenges and benefits might include:

[The **[State]{.mark}** Department [must be **scaled up**]{.mark} in
order [to **gain the capacity to absorb the DOD's
programs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moving the DOD's vast assistance budget
to the State Department would be one of the most significant
realignments of the U.S. national security agencies since the formation
of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002. Such a bureaucratic
change will require real reform and a significant expansion in the State
Department's capacity to manage and administer the substantial increase
in resources, as well as demand significant internal reform and
reorganization. To be clear, State Department bureaucracy has often been
its own biggest enemy; it is beset by turf battles, inefficiency, lack
of clear and timely decision-making, and tangled lines of authority. [As
it **[currently]{.mark}** stands, the State Department is **[far from
capable]{.mark}** of taking on the role this report suggests.
**[However]{.mark}**, these **[barriers]{.mark}** should [become the
**impetus for reform**, **not excuses** to favor the s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [these efforts should be undertaken
with other necessary reforms at the State Department to rebuild and
improve U.S. diplomatic capacity]{.underline}.

[Centralizing authorities and resources to the State Department would
simplify the interagency process]{.underline}. As noted above, moving
security assistance authorities to the State Department would represent
a huge realignment in the interagency process. But this reform effort
would align with long-term broad, bipartisan consensus that there is a
diplomacy-defense imbalance in U.S. foreign policy agencies.21
Realigning assistance resources must be fundamental to any effort to
reempower the State Department and would eventually improve interagency
functionality by resulting in better-managed policymaking. The costs of
moving authorities would be well worth the improvements in overall U.S.
policy by making it more coherent, less wasteful, and more effective.

Incorporate best practices from the DOD into State Department assistance

[The [**DOD's** **expertise** and **best practices** should **not** be
**lost**]{.mark} in transferring programs and resources to the State
Department. When the new administration announces its intent to transfer
resources, it should also announce plans to conduct a review of best

in current FMF assistance. [DOD programs have also made significant
strides in improving and incorporating assessment, monitoring, and
evaluation]{.underline} into its programs, as well as better processes
for incorporating other aspects of security assistance such as
institution building, [which the State Department should seek to

security assistance accounts at the DOD may provide guidance for
consolidating some of the State Department's different assistance
programs in the review process called for above.89

Review and [**[reform]{.mark}** the **[State]{.mark}** Department's
security assistance structure]{.underline}

[The State Department will need to **reorganize** the structure of
bureaus involved in security assistance to ensure that relevant offices
and personnel are coordinating with each other]{.underline}. Various
security assistance programs at the State Department, such as
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement or Diplomatic Security's
Antiterrorism Assistance, may need to be reorganized under a new
structure, such as one centralized security assistance office in the
Political-Military Affairs Bureau, under one undersecretary. [The State
Department should **[restructure]{.mark}** the
**[decision-making]{.mark} process** [to strengthen]{.mark} the role of
[the **Political-Military Affairs Bureau**]{.mark}, granting it more
**authority over funding** decisions and the **power to move funds**
between countries and regions. There should be a **clear
chain-of-command** and decision-making hierarchy in order to enable
coherent, consistent decisions on security assistance policy. The
reforms should also work to establish effective systems for
**cross-department** and **interagency** prioritization, planning, and
dispute resolution]{.underline}.

In a new system, [the offices charged with overseeing security
assistance [**must** have **greater authority** to **make decisions**
and **move funds** to **regain foreign policy
leverage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Political-Military Affairs
Bureau increases its relative authority, though, it should be required
to offer a clear strategic vision for security assistance and should be
held to account to implement this vision. The bureau should also be
required to produce an annual report to Congress outlining goals and
objectives for U.S. security assistance. For example, if the goal of
U.S. foreign policy is to rebalance toward democratic partners, the
Political-Military Affairs Bureau should have to show that it is taking
steps to meet that goal, such as by moving funds and creating new
initiatives that support emerging democracies.

Reorganize the decision-making structure for security assistance at the
State Department

To improve the overall U.S. security assistance system, it will be
critical for the State Department to set up a policy process where funds
are not treated as diplomatic entitlements owed to the regional bureaus.
Too often, regional bureaus---focused intensely on maintaining and
improving diplomatic relations---win out in arguments over rights and
values under the justification of prioritizing smooth diplomatic
relations and avoiding uncertainty. Meanwhile, functional bureaus such
as the Political-Military Affairs and the Democracy, Human Rights, and
Labor bureaus often lack the clout internally to overcome regional
bureau objections. [The **[duplicative s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation** [offices]{.mark}]{.underline} currently housed in
regional bureaus [[should be **moved** into]{.mark} the
**[P]{.mark}olitical-[M]{.mark}ilitary Affairs Bureau**]{.underline} to
augment the workforce. [By having their own security offices, regional
bureaus are less reliant on the expertise in the Political-Military
Affairs Bureau, as they have duplicated it in-house. This leads to
unending turf wars and poor coordination]{.underline}. At the same time,
bureaus such as Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor should be given a
greater role to inform security assistance policy, especially involving
decisions related to nondemocracies and human rights violators.

Bureaucratic incentives favor the status quo. [The **[State]{.mark}**
Department['s]{.mark} regional-functional [bureaucratic
divide]{.mark}---a perennial problem within the
agency---[inhibits]{.mark} its [effectiveness]{.mark} in managing
security assistance]{.underline}. In practice, the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs shares decision-making authority on
security assistance with regional bureaus that are loath to cut funding
for the countries under their purview. Many regional bureaus also
needlessly maintain their own separate security assistance offices,
reducing their reliance on the Political-Military Affairs Bureau and
complicating internal policymaking. Critiques of the State Department's
internal disfunction are valid, and [[**lessons learned** within]{.mark}
the U.S. government and the **[DOD]{.mark}** about how best to implement
security assistance [should be incorporated into **State**]{.mark}
Department [reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The State Department's leadership has in the past refused to ask
Congress for more money for security assistance. This has created an odd
juxtaposition where Pentagon officials and military officers plead with
Congress for more money for the State Department, while State Department
officials do not.34 The department's silence, however, was largely due
to fears that a conservative Congress would not increase the State
Department's overall budget but instead take funds from other accounts
such as development, undercutting the agency's other missions.

To address these challenges, [there [should]{.mark} be a review of the
security assistance structure at the State Department to **[centralize
decision-making]{.mark}** in order [to inform **better**]{.mark}**, more
coherent [policy]{.mark}** that aligns with the secretary of state's

There are several challenges with [today's State Department **[security
assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

It's not flexible. The majority of FMF's funds are earmarked in
appropriations for specific partners, such as Egypt and Israel. The
top-down direction of FMF funding leaves very little available funding
for State Department programmers to grant to countries in the event of
crises or new political dynamics. This makes it difficult for the State
Department to reallocate significant enough funds to provide useful
security assistance in times of crisis, especially when compared with
some of the DOD's resources and more flexible authorities. Senior State
Department officials have warned, "The more money and more authority you
move out of traditional accounts we have used for decades to work with
our partners, the more you lose the ability to balance."30 For example,
after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2014, the State Department wanted to
provide urgent security assistance but was only able to reallocate a few
million dollars from its FMF account.31

This [[lack of flexibility]{.mark} stands [in]{.mark} stark [contrast
to]{.mark}]{.underline} allocations of [[DOD]{.mark}
resources]{.underline}, some of which are granted to combatant commands
and security cooperation officers in country to decide when and to whom
funding is granted based on more immediate security considerations.32
[[As a result]{.mark} of this lack of flexibility, the State Department
is largely [**seen** as slow]{.mark} and bureaucratic and unable to
respond to security crises]{.underline} within the U.S. government.
[[But]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department [is **no
slower**]{.mark}]{.underline} or faster **[[than the
DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Often, the State Department is seen as
being slow in acting when it is actually holding on a decision due to
policy reasons or due to congressional concerns]{.underline}. This was
the case, for instance, in providing security assistance to partly fund
Pakistan's acquisition of additional F-16s.33

Develop a crisis response playbook for security assistance

[[Critics]{.underline}]{.mark} of the current system rightly [[point
out]{.mark} that U.S. security assistance [can move **too slowly** in a
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}. Relevant U.S. agencies
[[should]{.underline}]{.mark} come together to [[develop a standard
response playbook]{.mark} for U.S. security assistance during a crisis.
This could involve [incorporating the **best practices from
DOD**]{.mark} and State Department security assistance, [under]{.mark}
the [leadership of]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}**
Department]{.underline}. Agencies should conduct a review of the most
useful items---from nonlethal supplies to equipment that enhances
lethality---to send quickly to a partner in crisis. These [supplies
should be maintained in stockpiles in convenient global locations so
that they can be distributed quickly. Centralizing this response

[[The]{.mark} U.S. [**defense industry** would **not** be **damaged** by
reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite the recent insistence of the Trump
administration, the objective of U.S. security assistance should not be
to support the U.S. defense industrial base or as a jobs program; there
are much more effective ways of supporting American jobs, such as
through domestic infrastructure investments, than paying U.S. defense
firms to build needless tanks. Unfortunately, this was the outlook for
many in the Trump administration. Peter Navarro, the former president's
trade adviser, trumpeted that American jobs were sustained by continuing
to build tanks for Egypt.22 [This jobs [claim]{.mark} has been
[challenged by]{.mark} academic **[researchers]{.mark}**, who found that
[investments]{.mark} in arms sales [do **not** create]{.mark} as many
new **[jobs]{.mark}** as other potential investments and [offer
**underwhelming economic benefits**]{.mark} for
Americans]{.underline}.23 [Security assistance should instead be viewed
primarily as a diplomatic tool and thus controlled by
diplomats]{.underline}.

[Hypothetical costs of reforming]{.underline} the system [and disrupting
current implementation of U.S. security assistance are likely to be
significantly outweighed by improvements in the policymaking
process]{.underline} and well worth the political capital a new
administration and Congress would need to expend.

### Solvency -- Cybersecurity

#### Perception of DoD lead on cybersecurity cooperation backfires -- only counterplan solves

**Gady 15** Franz-Stefan Gady, Research Fellow at the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, "Perceptions and the Creeping
Militarization of US Foreign Policy," The Diplomat, 1-9-2015,
<https://thediplomat.com/2015/01/perceptions-and-the-creeping-militarization-of-us-foreign-policy/>
/GoGreen!

Today, I would like to add an additional (albeit simple) point: [The
**militarization** of U.S. **fo**reign **po**licy makes it **more
likely** that **other countries** will **perceive** the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [as **dangerous** and
**hostile**, and this is not in the U.S. national interest]{.underline}.

One example is the slow progress on cooperation between the United
States and China on cybersecurity. Despite various friendly overtures by
the United States, the Chinese are still reluctant to sit down with the
Americans and discuss ways to establish something akin to strategic
stability in cyberspace. Beijing's main critique is that the United
States is militarizing cyberspace.

My point here is neither to deny that both countries are engaged in a
long-term strategic competition, nor that a military component to this
competition (in cyberspace) is a necessity given the nature of the
current international system. Rather, I suggest that [[**cooperation**
might be **easier** if]{.underline}]{.mark} China were
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[assume]{.mark} that [the]{.mark}
U.S. **[military]{.mark}** establishment **[dominates the discussion on
cybersecurity]{.mark}** within the U.S. government]{.underline}. As I
pointed out here, this only feeds into Chinese fears of technological
and military inferiority vis-à-vis the United States.

We tend to forget that the principle objective of any military is "the
management of violence" as Samuel Huntington notes in The Soldier and
the State. Thus, [[having the **military too deeply involved** in a
field in which]{.mark} one of [the **operating principle**]{.mark}**s
[is non-confrontation]{.mark}** may **[send the wrong signal]{.mark}**
to the other side. Scanning various [**Chinese**, **Russian**]{.mark},
Indian [and **European**]{.mark} commentaries and analyses, the
[**fear** of]{.mark} a **[continuing militarization]{.mark}** of U.S.
foreign policy [is **pervasive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

According to Gordon Adams and Shoon Murray in their book Mission Creep
-- The Militarization of US Foreign Policy, militarization means, "a
growing trend to view decisions on national security strategy, policies,
and policy implementation from a military perspective." The authors
point out that this means that, "Foreign policy issues and security
challenges discussed at the senior policymaker level are framed as
military challenges, most readily susceptible to policy solutions and
programs for which military capabilities are seen as the appropriate
response."

[For example, returning to]{.underline} (the lack of) China-U.S.
**[[cooperation on cybersecurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the merging of
the position of the head of U.S. Cyber Command with that of the director
of the National Security Agency (NSA), while perhaps making sense from
an organizational point of view, [[only **amplifies the sense** that the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[is
also **militarizing cyberspace**]{.mark}, underlining the old "if all
you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail"
dilemma]{.underline}. [[**However**, **civilian
control**]{.underline}]{.mark} over an institution like the NSA [[is
**entirely possible**]{.underline}]{.mark}: In the United Kingdom, the
Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the British equivalent to
the NSA, is headed by a civilian and reports to the Foreign Secretary.

[The militarization of U.S. foreign policy did not happen overnight; its
origins lie in]{.underline} the beginnings of the Cold War with the
passing of the National Security Act of 1947, the adaptation of the
Truman Doctrine, the creation of NATO, and the Korean War to name some
of its roots. Throughout the Cold War decades an evolution slowly
expanded the role of the U.S. military from military combat and
deterrence to policy development (In 1977, the Defense Department
founded the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy -- an
in-house State Department).

In the 2000s, this trend accelerated and the Pentagon further expanded
its scope. One example that Murray and Adams cite in their book is [the
share of overall U.S. **[security assistance]{.mark}** -- [traditionally
a purview of]{.mark} the U.S. **[State]{.mark}** Department]{.underline}
-- administered through the U.S. Department of Defense: It rose from 25
percent in 2002 to 70 percent in 2011 before evening out at 50 percent
in 2014. In 2013, the Department of Defense budget was \$619 billion;
the State Department got \$54 billion.

Of course, numbers only tell one story, and the variance in funds
reflects the different mission sets of the two institutions. Still, it
also emphasizes [[**the reason why** **by default the military
is**]{.mark} **often [asked to step in]{.mark}** -- money]{.underline}.
And this brings me back to my initial point: [An [**inequality of
resources** leads to]{.mark} an **[inequality in policy]{.mark}** and as
a corollary the **militarization** of U.S. foreign policy, [which is
**detrimental**]{.mark}]{.underline} to U.S. national interests.

International Engagement and Nation-State Deterrence

The third-largest DoD-related category (fourth-largest overall) was
provisions that fostered engagement with international partners to
improve their cybersecurity posture, as well as policies to deter
nation-state actors from conducting cyberattacks. [Like other
operational domains, **[DoD]{.mark}** has an imperative to collaborate
with allies in cyberspace]{.underline}. [Since 2017, Congress has tasked
DoD to [strengthen]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orth **[A]{.mark}**tlantic
**[T]{.mark}**reaty **[O]{.mark}**rganization['s **cyber
defenses**]{.mark}]{.underline},25 work with Baltic countries to improve
their cybersecurity posture,26 and consider engaging in cyber exercises
with allies in the Indo-Pacific.27 The last five NDAAs also emphasize
the need to deter nation-state adversaries in cyberspace---specifically
China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea---with Congress mandating reports
on how DoD deters these actors in FY 2017, 2018, and 2019.28

As a part of the US cyber-deterrent strategy, Congress included several
measures that impose consequences on bad actors and hold them to account
for their malicious cyber activities, like cybercrime. For example, the
FY 2020 and FY 2021 NDAAs require DoD to assess North Korea's revenue
generated from their cybercrime activities and provide recommendations
on how to counter China's industrial espionage and intellectual-property
theft.29 Similarly, an FY 2019 provision requires the Secretary of
Defense to create a list of countries that pose a risk to US
cybersecurity, including those that knowingly participate in criminal
activity.30 Lastly, the FY 2021 NDAA establishes a Joint Cyber Planning
Office within DHS, allowing federal agencies to collaborate with private
entities to develop plans that disrupt the cyber infrastructure that
cybercriminals use to conduct malicious cyber activities, like
ransomware attacks.31

While these measures could deter cybercriminals and the nation-states
that abet them, they do not impact other cyber enforcement areas. For
instance, state and local law enforcement agencies require more
resources to bolster their digital forensic capabilities to identify
cybercriminals.32 [The **[State]{.mark}** Department, too,
[requires]{.mark} additional [**authorities** and **resources** to
support international partners]{.mark}' efforts to improve their
cybercrime enforcement capacity. [As a result]{.mark}, the
**[tools]{.mark}** and resources [available]{.mark} to the US government
and its partners to pursue cybercriminals **[remain
limited]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Beginning in FY 2020, the number of non-DoD-related cyber provisions
began increasing, such as supply-chain security and industrial policy;
critical infrastructure protection; and election security.

Supply-Chain Security and Industrial Policy

Provisions that protect and secure US Information and Communications
Technologies (ICTs) were the third-largest category that included
measures to prohibit federal agencies from purchasing ICTs from specific
companies and promote the creation of an ICT-industrial policy.
Supply-chain security and the need to develop an ICT-industrial policy
gained prominence because of 5G and the Chinese-based company Huawei's
dominance in the 5G supply-chain marketplace. This raised
national-security concerns about the security and integrity of data
flowing over networks with Huawei technology and Huawei's ability to
intercept or disrupt data and services at the request of the Chinese
government.33 Since then, Members of Congress have included provisions
in NDAAs and passed similar bills to "clean" US networks of Huawei
technology and other companies owned and operated by nation-state
adversaries.34 Yet, American and European companies lag behind Huawei in
5G technology and therefore lack a reliable alternative to replace
Huawei;35 an issue that transcends 5G technology and pervades other ICT
markets and supply chains.36 As a result, Congress has debated about how
to create a new industrial policy that would invest federal funds into
ICT companies to create a friendly competitor to Chinese businesses.
However, the past two NDAAs show that Congress has ended this debate and
inked a 21st-century industrial policy whose origin centers on national
security.

From FY 2017 to FY 2019, these provisions focused on protecting DoD's
ICT supply chain from foreign-owned technology and establishing stronger
information-sharing capabilities within intelligence agencies.37 These
NDAAs also included significant laws to prohibit foreign companies\'
influence in US markets. For example, the Foreign Investment Risk Review
Modernization Act of 2018 was included in the FY 2019 NDAA and expanded
the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States' scope to
address additional national security concerns, such as the supply-chain
integrity of ICTs.38

Beginning in the FY 2020 NDAA, Members of Congress included provisions
to incentivize domestic production of ICTs to wean US businesses and
agencies off foreign-owned hardware and software. In fact, the FY 2021
NDAA included the new title, "Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce
Semiconductors for America." Examples of provisions that fell within
this title included:

a report on how to increase investments in the "industries of the
future;"39

a trust fund within the Treasury Department to provide grants to promote
and deploy 5G technology;40

a public-private partnership to provide incentives (e.g., grants) to a
consortium of companies to develop and produce microelectronics;41 and

federal financial assistance to incentivize investment in US
semiconductor manufacturing, among others.42

While increased federal investment into ICTs is needed and has
precedent,43 Members of Congress must consider other areas of an
industrial policy that may not fall squarely within the NDAA. For
instance, the CSC detailed a series of recommendations on expanding the
roles of the United States Agency for International Development, the
Export-Import Bank, the Commerce Department, and the US International
Development Finance Corporation to implement a whole-of-government
approach to creating an industrial policy.44

Critical Infrastructure Protection, Election Security, and DHS' Cyber
Mission

In addition to creating an industrial policy, Congress has used the NDAA
to protect domestic critical infrastructure, secure election systems,
and empower DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA). While these provisions are limited in number compared to other
categories, they have significant implications in shaping US
cybersecurity policy.

[**Although DoD does have a role** in protecting domestic critical
infrastructure from attacks, **[civilian agencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(known as Sector-Specific Agencies or Sector Risk Management Agencies)
[[are **primarily responsible** for]{.mark} the [**day-to-day
partnerships** with]{.mark} private **[critical infrastructure
partners]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To further empower this partnership,
Congress included key recommendations from the CSC to secure critical
infrastructure from cyber threats. This included redefining the roles
and responsibilities of sector-specific agencies who oversee the 16
critical infrastructure sectors;45 creating a plan that would maintain
and restore the economy in the face of a significant event (e.g.,
cyberattack);46 and strengthening and institutionalizing DoD and other
federal agencies cybersecurity initiatives with private partners.47

Election security also garnered significant attention among Members of
Congress, with 11 provisions included in the past five NDAAs and a new
title in the FY 2020 NDAA called "Election Matters." These provisions
examined how the National Guard could assist states in securing election
systems;48 enabled information sharing with state election officials;49
and created a strategy for countering Russian cyber threats to US
elections.50

DHS' CISA also saw a surge of cyber-related provisions in FY 2021
compared to previous years mainly because it was created at the end of
2018 and due to a series of CSC recommendations that sought to
strengthen its authorities. In fact, the FY 2021 NDAA was the first time
in the past five NDAAs that Congress included a title called "Homeland
Security Matters." These provisions gave CISA the ability to:

issue subpoenas to internet-service providers so that they can identify
a company that may have a cyber vulnerability;51

conduct threat hunting operations on federal networks;52 and

place cybersecurity coordinators in each state to improve federal
relations with state and private partners, among other things.53

The 2021 NDAA also creates an office within CISA to convene federal
agencies and private partners to develop joint cyber planning operations
for protecting and responding to malicious cyber incidents.54 As noted
previously, this could impose consequences on cybercriminals and other
malicious actors by taking down the infrastructures they use to
perpetrate their crimes and acts.

The culmination of these provisions has the potential to transform
public-private partnerships, solidify state and federal cooperation to
protect elections, and enable CISA to perform its duties.

With Congress passing limited cyber legislation, Members should weigh
the pros and cons of either including additional non-DoD cybersecurity
provisions in future NDAAs or creating a cyber-omnibus bill to take a
holistic approach to cybersecurity.

The SolarWinds hack, the Microsoft Exchange Servers vulnerability, and
the relentless ransomware epidemic illustrate the need for Congressional
action, but Congress must consider the best approach to enact
legislation. Congress should weigh whether to include additional
cyber-related categories in future NDAAs or create a cyber-omnibus bill
so all agencies are provided with authorities and resources to deter and
respond to cyber incidents.

The NDAA Approach

Congress sent about two dozen cyber-related bills to the Oval Office
over a four-year time-period, which contained additional cyber
provisions within them. Yet, this pales in comparison to the near 300
cyber provisions included in the past five NDAAs, with a hundred in the
past NDAA alone. The FY 2021 NDAA was unique among others due to three
new sections, which expanded the type of cyber provisions typically seen
in an NDAA---Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for
America, Cyberspace-Related Matters; and Homeland Security Matters. As
noted, the CSC was responsible for over 20% of the FY 2021 NDAA's
cyber-related provisions, many of which fell within those three titles.
With the CSC renewed for another year and advancing much-needed old and
new recommendations to fill policy gaps, these and additional new titles
may be included in the FY 2022 NDAA.

[Congress [should]{.mark} therefore [not shy away from including]{.mark}
other [**cybersecurity** matters]{.mark} that are **[not]{.mark}**
directly **[related to]{.mark} the [DoD]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With
ransomware and other forms of cybercrime at an all-time high, Congress
should consider creating a new title in the FY 2022 NDAA called
"Cybercrime Related Matters." Members could then include [provisions
that would [provide additional]{.mark} funds to]{.underline} states and
locals to enhance their digital forensic capabilities, improve
assistance awarded to cybercrime victims, transform cybercrime
reporting, and **[provide [aid to US allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** to
bolster their criminal justice systems to investigate cybercrime cases,
in addition to the CSC cybercrime recommendations.55

However, Congress should consider the pros and cons of using the NDAA to
shape US cybersecurity policy. It is possible that there are limited
cons and that the NDAA is simply a legislative means to an end. Yet,
[there may be [**limitations** to thinking about **cybersecurity**
through the **defense**]{.mark} bill and a national security
[lens]{.mark}, rather than an economic or innovative one]{.underline}.
In other words, should the US ICT-industrial policy strategy, for
example, be grounded in a larger infrastructure package? Should filling
the cybersecurity workforce gap be part of a 21st-century workforce
bill? These types of bills will face political difficulties, and it is
therefore understandable that they are included in a bill that has a
perfect batting record for passing both congressional chambers over the
past 50 years. But [congressional members [should]{.mark}]{.underline}
then work together to overcome committee jurisdictional issues to
[[include provisions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the NDAA [[that **do not
have a nexus to the DoD**]{.underline}]{.mark} or national security,
[[which will **enable a holistic approach** to]{.mark} US
**[cybersecurity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The Cyber-Omnibus Bill Approach

If Congress is already keen on including non-DoD provisions in the NDAA,
they should consider the potential benefits of creating a cyber-omnibus
bill. A cyber-omnibus bill [would allow Congress to think about
cybersecurity through a **holistic** approach by creating provisions
that complement each other with a **whole-of-society**
lens]{.underline}. For instance, [such a bill [could]{.mark} enumerate
and [**resource** a **cyber bureau** within]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department]{.underline},56 **[[de-conflict its
mission with DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and provide resources to FBI
attaches to support overseas cybercrime efforts. It could [also ensure
that states and civilian agencies are provided the resources to prevent,
respond to, [and]{.mark} investigate cyber incidents to **[lessen the
burden placed on DoD assets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, like the National
Guard.

[This legislative approach would also [allow for **commensurate
resources** to be allocated to **civilian agencies**]{.mark} who are
responsible for partnering with private companies to protect the US
against cyberattacks]{.underline}. [Currently, the **DoD's cyber
operation budget** is **higher** than **CISA**, the **FBI**, and the
**Justice** Department's National Security Division
**combined**]{.underline}.57 [DoD's cyber-related budget is also "nearly
**25% higher** than the **total** going to **all civilian departments**,
including the departments of **Homeland Security**, **Treasury**, and
**Energy**]{.underline}."58 Further, some of the provisions included in
the NDAA are unfunded mandates. Congress, for example, did not
appropriate funds to implement the industrial policy it created in the
2021 NDAA.59 [Ensuring that the agencies [responsible for
helping]{.mark} state, local, private, and [**international partners**
prepare]{.mark} for [and recover]{.mark} from cyber incidents is equally
important as resourcing DOD's cyber operations and [**necessary** for a
complete **cyber deterrence strategy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Conlusion

Congress has used the NDAAs to pass important cybersecurity legislation,
but Members must be aware of the importance of non-national security
cybersecurity issues that tend to not be included in the NDAA. To be
sure, a new legislative package would cause congressional jurisdiction
headaches, which may outweigh any cons of relying on the NDAA to pass
cyber-related legislation. Yet, the [recent nation-state and
cybercriminal activities taken against the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and private companies [show the need for Congress
to use any means necessary to pass a wide range of cyber-related bills,
with adequate resources provided to agencies, to bolster areas of US
cybersecurity strategy that have been ignored thus far]{.underline}.

Cyber Diplomacy for Great-Power Competition: Seizing and Sustaining
Initiative

[Political conditions today favor an energetic U.S. diplomatic campaign.
Russia and China's aggressive information, political, and economic
warfare campaigns have highlighted the risks to U.S. partners and
allies]{.underline}.60 [Those allies are eager to improve their
cyberspace security and to work cooperatively with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. The U.S. government can
capitalize on this favorable environment by forging agreements with
foreign partners that encourage a deeper level of interaction. The
United States can build coalitions for continuous pressure against
adversary cyberspace campaigns outside of armed conflict.61 Such
agreements and the joint efforts that follow will normalize
collaborative cyberspace operations for mutual defense.

Essentially, the State Department needs to operationalize the core
objective of cyber persistence: seizing and sustaining initiative. [The
**[State]{.mark}** Department [is **uniquely positioned** to]{.mark}
convene interagency discussions on **[defin]{.mark}ing
[boundaries]{.mark} of acceptable behavior** below the level of armed
conflict, to **[forge consensus with allies]{.mark}** and partners on
boundaries of acceptable competition, and to **[mobilize]{.mark}
international [coalitions to enforce]{.mark}** those boundaries. It can
**[better enable]{.mark}** the Department of **[Defense]{.mark}** to
persistently engage and defend forward in cyberspace below the level of
armed conflict --- a necessary ingredient for **[constructing
norms]{.mark}** through interaction]{.underline}. Diplomats should be
well-versed in the full range of U.S. cyber activities and explain them
to U.S. partners in order to set the international conditions for the
United States to compete in a globally interconnected domain. With these
goals in mind, the following recommendations are offered as a roadmap
for improving U.S. cyber diplomacy.

Communicate and Build Consensus

[The **State** Department's foreign service officers forward-deployed as
"**cyber diplomats**" can **strengthen consensus among
allies**]{.underline} and partners [on the nature of the cyber security
problem and on the need for action to address it]{.underline}. To do so,
they should be conversant with the U.S. government's efforts to address
cyber competition and armed with information to speak authoritatively
about them. The State Department has long promoted a framework for
responsible state behavior in cyberspace. The key elements of that
framework include: (1) affirmation that established principles of
international law apply to state behavior in cyberspace;62 (2) adherence
to certain non-binding norms of state behavior in cyberspace during
peacetime; and (3) consideration, development, and implementation of
practical confidence-building measures to reduce the risk of conflict in
cyberspace. Since not all states share American views on responsible
behavior in cyberspace, the United States is working with partners and
allies on collective attribution and imposition of consequences.

These initiatives are now being complemented by the Department of
Defense's strategy of defend forward and U.S. Cyber Command's
operational approach of persistent engagement. The State Department and
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) officers in
missions around the world need to be well-versed in these other efforts
and prepared to explain them to foreign partners on a routine basis.
America's partners want to understand U.S. government strategy and
policies.63 It is U.S. policy that cross-domain responses to cyber
aggression should be complemented with steady and sustained activities
to make networks more resilient, to defend them as far forward as
practicable, and to contest the most dangerous adversaries.64 Every
diplomatic engagement that includes cyber issues would be an opportunity
to build support for these mutually reinforcing approaches.

Bolster Cyber Cadre

The greatest talent, most consequential research and development, and
most innovative applications of cyber and other emerging technologies
are globally distributed across individuals, commercial entities,
governments, and academia. [**[Competing successfully]{.mark}** requires
recognizing, understanding, and leveraging insights and advances
wherever they reside in real time. The nation that best understands [and
can most **rapidly harvest**]{.mark} **the [benefits]{.mark}** of
changing knowledge]{.underline} (e.g., quantum encryption, artificial
intelligence, machine learning, high performance computing, big data,
5G) [will be best positioned to secure its future]{.underline}.
Conversely, states that lag behind competitors will find closing gaps a
daunting and risky challenge. 5G represents the proverbial canary in the
coal mine because the United States lags behind China in deployment.
Unless the United States ensures the talent is in place to monitor and
lead on future technologies, it may again be caught unprepared.

The State Department does designate foreign service officers with a
cyber portfolio, but they are usually assigned as an additional duty,
often to economic officers at embassies and consulates. One option would
be a dedicated cadre of "cyber diplomacy-coned" officers,65 or even a
regional dedicated officer cadre located at a large or strategic embassy
in each region to augment the part-time officers at post. These cyber
diplomacy-coned foreign service officers would report on priorities and
trends in research and investments across governments, industries,
academia, and research institutes worldwide, and identify where
adversary regimes are vulnerable to diplomatic, information, military,
and economic threats.66 They would "identify and catalyze
opportunities," in the words of the U.S. National Security
Strategy,67helping to set the conditions for competition by building
mechanisms for information sharing and agile collaboration.

Enable Defend Forward

The U.S. National Cyber Strategy's guidance to promote a framework of
responsible state behavior in cyberspace, one that ensures there are
consequences for irresponsible behavior, is a key objective for the
United States. To succeed, this framework should be pursued in tandem
with an active approach to stem ongoing adversary cyberspace campaigns
outside of armed conflict. [The Department of **Defense** is **now
defending forward**, outside its existing networks, to mitigate threats
before they reach the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [[It is
time for]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department [to **join
in**]{.mark}]{.underline} these efforts.

[[An informal **division of labor** currently]{.mark} exists between the
departments of **State** and **Defense**, whereby the former promotes
**norms** in traditional diplomatic channels while the latter pursues
defend forward through military channels]{.underline}.
**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** this leaves several problems unresolved.
[[**Parallel communication** increases]{.mark} the [risk of **messaging
fratricide**]{.mark} across military and diplomatic channels in partner
nations]{.underline}. [Military cyber operations may engage foreign
policy sensitivities that the **[State]{.mark}** Department [is **better
equipped**]{.mark} to address]{.underline}. On the other hand, State
Department desk officers may throw a wrench into planning because they
do not understand Defense Department strategy.

The United States needs to operate continuously alongside allies and
partners. [[**Leadership** from]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}**
Department [can **increase** the **speed, agility, and scale** of defend
forward activities]{.mark} and operations by working through diplomatic
channels to set the conditions for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to operate by, with, and through foreign partners
and their networks in order to expose, contest, and defend against
adversary cyber aggression. Sustained diplomacy can help
institutionalize these operational partnerships and make defend forward
more anticipatory and effective]{.underline}. Institutionalized
cooperation, including the conduct of joint and coalition operations and
the development of agreed-upon legal and policy frameworks, is essential
to prevail in long-term strategic competition.

The State Department can set the conditions for consensual foreign
partner-enabled discovery operations (i.e., "hunt forward" operations)
through bilateral engagements.68 These operations enable the United
States and its partners to understand an adversary's tactics,
techniques, and procedures. [This will in turn enable network defense of
U.S. partners, improve anticipatory resilience of U.S. and partner
networks, [and **thwart cyberspace aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The State Department can scale the process of explaining the Defense
Department's defend forward strategy, enabling the United States to
proactively set the conditions for "hunt forward" operations. [The State
Department can [also]{.mark} actively ensure **[Defense]{.mark}**
Department [**cyber teams** receive support from]{.mark} U.S. embassy
country teams and benefit from insights about foreign partner networks
gained through **[State]{.mark}**]{.underline} and USAID[[**-led**
**cyber security capacity-building**]{.mark} programs]{.underline}.

Mobilize Coalitions

The National Security Strategy calls on U.S. diplomats to "build and
lead coalitions that advance shared interests" in the ongoing contests
for power.69 The State Department has a history of coalition building,
most recently with the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS formed in 2014.
The State Department is thus uniquely positioned to mobilize partners to
sustain pressure on adversary cyberspace behavior and cyber-enabled
campaigns. A three-tiered coalition could increase information sharing,
agile collaboration, and operational agility.

At the core of this coalition would be states that possess the
capability and capacity to conduct full-spectrum cyberspace operations
and work with diplomatic, law enforcement, and industry partners. A
second tier would comprise less-capable or less-committed states that
core states operate with (and through) to counter and contest aggression
below the level of armed conflict. The United States has extensive
experience negotiating basing and transit rights in sovereign territory
along the Soviet perimeter during the Cold War. It should negotiate the
cyber analogue of basing and transit rights to set the conditions for
swift and persistent action. The transit issue is likely to be less
controversial for allies and partners than remote cyber operations on
infrastructure within another state's territory (addressed below).

A third tier would comprise public and private actors across the
broadest practicable set of countries in a resilience consortium to
leverage collective market power, secure the internet, and
counterbalance the illiberal vision of information control promoted by
Russia and China.70 This is especially urgent as countries shift from 3G
and 4G (third and fourth generation) to 5G communications networks. By
offering attractive financial terms, authoritarian governments can
dominate the telecommunications industry in developing countries and
control digital tools that increase censorship, repression, and
surveillance. It is imperative that public and private actors assist the
broader coalition in combating such trends.

Several pillars for a resilience consortium already exist. Cyber
security capacity-building received a boost when the State Department
and USAID launched the Digital Connectivity and Cybersecurity
Partnership in July 2018, with a focus on the Indo-Pacific region.71 In
July 2019, USAID launched a development framework called Countering
Malign Kremlin Influence. The framework was designed to build the
economic and democratic resilience of countries targeted by Russia.
Cyber security is considered high priority.72 The launch of the U.S.
Development Finance Corporation in October 2019 can attract private
capital flows into contested markets to stem the spread of surveillance
networks.73 In November 2019, the United States, Australia, and Japan
announced the Blue Dot Network to promote high-quality and trusted
standards for global infrastructure development as an alternative to the
predatory lending and debt-trap diplomacy of China's Belt and Road
Initiative.74 By re-prioritizing emerging market economies for
affordable and reliable internet access and infrastructure, the United
States can shore up internet freedom, ensure economic prosperity for the
United States and its partners, and secure the outer ring of
telecommunications networks as America's first line of cyber defense.

Another important initiative is the Clean Network program. Building upon
the 5G Clean Path initiative, the Clean Network is a comprehensive
effort by a coalition of like-minded countries and companies to secure
their critical telecommunications, cloud, data analytics, mobile apps,
Internet of Things, and 5G technologies from malign actors. The
coalition relies on trusted vendors that are not subject to unjust or
extra-judicial control by authoritarian governments.75 Five new lines of
effort were recently announced to ensure telecommunication carriers,
mobile app stores, apps, cloud-based systems, and undersea cables are
all rooted in digital trust standards.76 More than 30 countries and
territories are now Clean Countries, and many of the world's biggest
telecommunications companies are Clean Telcos.77 These efforts have laid
the foundation for a broader coalition the State Department could
mobilize to implement competitive cyber strategies.

Accelerate Interagency Consensus on Conventions Below the Use of Force

What constitutes acceptable behavior in competition below the level of
armed conflict? While there is a normative prohibition against crossing
the threshold of armed conflict and while states appear to tacitly agree
on many types of behavior that cross that threshold, the unilateral
ingenuity states display in developing novel approaches to achieving
strategic gains invites the potential for miscalculations on and around
this threshold. Moreover, the strategic competitive space outside of
armed conflict is still maturing. It is a space where the rules are
malleable and where mutual understandings of acceptable and unacceptable
behavior are few.78

[The U.S. government needs to reach an interagency consensus on the
preferred boundaries of acceptable behavior outside of armed conflict
and promote them in international fora. The **[State]{.mark}**
Department [is the **natural leader**]{.mark} for these
efforts]{.underline}. Interagency discussions should proceed in tandem
with consultations with the private sector. Currently, discussions with
private sector entities all too often are isolated within individual
agencies, with little coordination between agencies --- even between the
State Department and USAID. Agreed-upon conventions can then be
reinforced by the actions of all departments and agencies. [Working
bilaterally, multilaterally, and through international institutions, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates --- [**led by** the **State**
Department --- can influence and message what behaviors it views as
unacceptable]{.underline}. [This [can]{.mark} help **[reduce the
ambiguity that adversaries exploit]{.mark}**, enhance the ability to
**[build coalitions]{.mark}** to support the U.S. view, and enable the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to more effectively **[secure
commitments]{.mark}** from like-minded countries to impose consequences
on those whose actions are counter to the principles]{.underline}.

However, the United States should first decide what it believes are the
boundaries of acceptable and unacceptable behavior, which requires it to
detail how national interests manifest in cyberspace and the security
postures needed to defend those interests.79 Other nations will need to
do the same. The issue is where there is convergence, not just with
like-minded states, but with adversaries. Examples that come to mind are
the integrity of the global financial infrastructure; nuclear command,
control, and communications; and disinformation that disrupts public
health efforts --- an issue which is of special relevance in light of
the current global health crisis.80

Shape International Discourse on Cyber Operations and Sovereignty

One of the greatest concerns for allies and partners are operations that
generate cyber effects outside U.S. military networks. These operations
are designed to disrupt the ability of an adversary to conduct cyber
operations against the United States and its allies --- what the 2018
U.S. Cyber Command vision refers to as "contest."81 There is no U.S.
declaratory policy on the sovereignty implications of cyber operations.
Specifically, the United States has not declared its position on whether
remote cyber operations that generate effects on infrastructure within
another state's territory require that state's consent. There is a
divide among states on this issue, and on whether such acts require
international legal justification. [[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[[**divergence** in **state views** on how **i**]{.mark}**nternational
[law]{.mark}** [applies to]{.mark} states' conduct of **[cyber
op]{.mark}**eration[s **below the threshold of a use of force**]{.mark}
and outside the context of armed conflict]{.underline}.82 On one end of
the spectrum is the United Kingdom, which has publicly declared that
remote cyber operations below the non-intervention threshold are not
prohibited by international law and do not require consent.83 On the
other end of the spectrum, the Netherlands agrees with the 2017 Tallinn
Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Operations that
such operations violate state sovereignty and require consent.84

The United Kingdom and the Netherlands have officially declared their
respective positions and they have polar opposite views on this core
question. Moreover, Estonia, Australia, and the United States have
officially articulated their positions on the applicability of
international law to cyber operations yet have not weighed in on this
particular issue. Gary Corn considers this range of positions "prima
facie evidence of the unsettled nature of the question."85 The United
States needs to seize the diplomatic initiative and publicly articulate
its stance on this issue to help influence the court of world opinion.
The most explicit official U.S. statement comes from the Department of
Defense general counsel:

For cyber operations that would not constitute a prohibited intervention
or use-of-force, the Department believes there is not sufficiently
widespread and consistent State practice resulting from a sense of legal
obligation to conclude that customary international law generally
prohibits such non-consensual cyber operations in another State's
territory. This proposition is recognized in the Department's adoption
of the "defend forward" strategy: "We will defend forward to disrupt or
halt malicious cyber activity at its source, including activity that
falls below the level of armed conflict." The Department's commitment to
defend forward including to counter foreign cyber activity targeting the
United States --- comports with our obligations under international law
and our commitment to the rules-based international order.86

[This is an area where the **[State]{.mark}** Department **[should be
leading]{.mark}** internationally **[if the
U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[**hopes to persuade others** to adopt its]{.mark} preferred
**[norms]{.mark}**, particularly as allies wrestle with **legal
ambiguities** surrounding cyber operations]{.underline}.87

Adopt a Competitive Mindset

The 2018 U.S. National Defense Strategy challenged the Defense
Department to adopt a "competitive mindset" in order to "out-think,
out-maneuver, out-partner, and out-innovate" threat actors.88 The
department responded to this challenge. It reorganized, fielded new
technologies and capabilities, created cross-functional teams that
effectively work across traditional bureaucratic lines to prepare for
long-term strategic challenges from China and Russia, and pivoted to the
proactive cyber strategy of defend forward.

[There is **progress at** the **State** Department in adapting to
**great-power competition**]{.underline}. Secretary Mike Pompeo has
given a series of speeches on the challenges posed by China, most
forcefully on July 23, 2020, at the Nixon Presidential Library.89 In
2019, all policy bureaus were directed to build strategic plans that
prioritize competing with China.90China's challenge to the Western-led,
liberal world order has impacted decisions on foreign assistance.
USAID's "Clear Choice" framework provides alternatives in the energy,
digital, and infrastructure sectors to China's development model.91 The
State Department-led campaign to convince countries to ban Huawei
equipment from their 5G networks is bearing fruit as a growing number of
states, including all members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing
alliance, exclude Huawei from their 5G networks. China's crackdown in
Hong Kong and its lack of transparency about the origins of the novel
coronavirus no doubt added to concerns regarding the use of Chinese
technology.92

Thus, the State Department has begun to adopt a competitive mindset. Yet
much remains to be done. Framing the Huawei issue as a strategic
competition over the future of digital governance and control of the
global digital backbone, in addition to the security risks of embedding
a Chinese provider into critical communications infrastructure, reflects
a competitive mindset. So does the proactive approach of the Global
Engagement Center, which leads interagency efforts to address foreign
adversary disinformation and propaganda that undermines U.S. interests.
Cyber diplomacy by the State Department needs to embrace this
competitive mindset, and this will require reprioritizing resources and
revisiting current lines of effort.

Conclusion: A State Department Cyber Strategy

[A new bureau for cyberspace within the U.S. State Department can help
to consolidate cyber issues. However, it will remain an incomplete
effort, as cyber issues touch nearly every bureau and require a
broad-based approach]{.underline}. This reflects the pervasiveness of
digital technologies across all facets of human endeavor --- economic,
social, political, and security. It also reflects adversaries'
integrated strategies that use cyberspace to gain strategic advantage
and redefine the policies, principles, and standards of the global
order. Consequently, no single bureau can manage the full panoply of
cyber issues.

More importantly, [making bureaucratic changes divorced of strategy is
just rearranging deck chairs]{.underline}. The State Department should
understand its role and then strategically reorient its bureaucracy to
meet that strategy's objectives. [A cyber strategy is not a panacea.
However, properly applied across the whole department, an effective
strategy would **unify efforts**]{.underline} and ensure the State
Department's cyber priorities are aligned with the National Security
Strategy's focus on great-power competition, and improve coordination
and integration --- particularly between the Office of the Coordinator
for Cyber Issues, which focuses on technical cyber incidents, and the
Global Engagement Center, which focuses on information and influence
operations. Like the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland
Security, USAID, and the Department of Justice have all produced
department-wide cyber strategies or frameworks that are internally
focused and externally nested.93 An effective cyber strategy could build
upon the progress the United States has already made and posture the
nation to regain the initiative in cyberspace competition with
authoritarian rivals. It should include the creation of a cyber
diplomacy-coned career track for its foreign service officers. It should
articulate how [the **State** Department will **lead**, **partner**, and
**act** in order to set the conditions for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to compete and **sustain strategic advantage in
cyberspace**]{.underline}. And it should support U.S. government efforts
to persistently counter and contest malicious foreign cyberspace
campaigns and influence operations.

Adversaries of the United States and its allies and partners employ
highly variable approaches, aligned to their national interests and
competitive advantages against U.S. vulnerabilities across all elements
of national power. Although competition in physical space is episodic,
it is continuous in the cyber and information spaces where persistent
campaigns gradually accrete meaningful advantage short of war.
**[Without]{.underline}** adopting and employing a proactive strategy
against these threats across the whole of government, [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [may eventually find
itself in a position of parity or even **disadvantage with
adversaries**]{.underline}. [In such a situation, emboldened adversaries
will have shaped the competitive space to the point where they **will
have won without fighting**]{.underline}.

/GoGreen!

A U.N. Group of Governmental Experts produced a consensus report
[outlining norms of responsible state behavior in
**[cyberspace]{.mark}**]{.underline} that was welcomed by the U.N.
General Assembly in 2015. However, U.N. members were by no means agreed
on how international law applies to cyberspace. Although that issue was
addressed more successfully in 2021, [**diplomats** are still
**negotiating** critical questions like what counts as **cybercrime**,
**critical infrastructure**, **espionage**, or many of the other
foundational concepts in this area]{.underline}. All of these questions,
and many others beyond the negotiations of the United Nations, have
long-term implications for the future of the internet, as cyberspace
policy experts navigate a path between security and surveillance, and
between openness and authoritarianism. [[To be successful]{.mark} in
this diplomacy, the **[State]{.mark}** Department [should
**prioritize**]{.mark} **these issues** and provide its diplomats with
organizational structures that will support America's proactive
leadership]{.underline}. In short, [the State Department should have a
**dedicated cyberspace policy bureau**]{.underline}.

The focus and activities of such a bureau would be functionally very
different from what will be involved in addressing other technology
issues. A Bureau of International Cyberspace Policy would be responsible
for implementing a relatively established policy for cyber diplomacy.
The head of the bureau would be working to ensure an open,
interoperable, reliable, and secure internet, pushing back on
authoritarian leanings in internet governance, and advocating for a
multi-stakeholder model for the future of cyberspace. Certain details
may change, but the core elements of this policy have been consistent
across administrations and Congresses. Accordingly, the real added value
of a cyberspace policy bureau is not in defining policy, but rather
implementing that policy, which will require extensive engagement with
"non-aligned" countries to help sway the balance of opinion toward an
open internet, and international capacity-building efforts to help drive
progress toward greater global cyber security.

By contrast, [the challenge U.S. policymakers confront on **emerging
tech**nologies is]{.underline} a question of [establishing what
America's international policies and diplomatic strategies should
be]{.underline}. As the National Security Commission on Artificial
Intelligence observed in relation to the State Department, a [**[lack of
clear leadership on emerging tech]{.mark}**nology "**[hinders]{.mark}**
the Department's [ability to]{.mark} make strategic technology policy
decisions" as part of a larger reorientation toward **strategic
competition**]{.underline}.

Policymakers and officials working on emerging technologies will also
face the challenge of adapting overarching policies as technologies
emerge, develop, and ideally stabilize over time. Emerging technologies
do not remain "emerging" indefinitely, and so an organizational
structure that allows the development of cohesive strategies around
these technologies should have the flexibility to shift between topics.
Of course, cyberspace policy and the strategic considerations that guide
it will also certainly need to adapt to changes, but its basic focus is
likely to remain more stable. Much of America's work in outlining
cyberspace policy has already been done, and thus the missions that
remain --- [for example **[work]{.mark}ing [with]{.mark}** partners and
[**allies** on **joint attribution of cyber
attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, rallying votes in the United Nations,
[and managing capacity building projects]{.underline} --- are unlikely
to change dramatically any time soon.

Undoubtedly, there will be many areas of overlap between the work of
those handling emerging technology issues and the responsibilities of a
cyberspace policy office. But there will also be overlap between efforts
on emerging technologies and matters handled by the Bureau of Economics
and Business Affairs, the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, the
Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation, and many others.
The fact that there is overlap between two organizational constructs
should not be taken as a justification to merge them, and while
technology obviously plays a central role in both cyberspace policy and
emerging technologies policy, the actual work required to address them
is very different.

It also makes sense to keep some technology issues in their current
bureaucratic homes because of their historical legacy and the subsequent
development of specialized expertise within those homes. No one would
suggest, for example, that emerging issues in nuclear technology should
be pulled out of the Bureau of International Security and
Nonproliferation and made the responsibility of a new emerging
technology bureau. And some technologies might only have globally
significant implications for a relatively short period of time. Advanced
robotics, for example, might have a major impact on manufacturing and
broader economic areas, which could require the sustained attention of
policymakers as they grapple with the initial implications of such
technology. But once advanced robotics become a routine part of
industrial operations, it would make less sense to have brought the
issue under a new bureau when the pre-existing functional and regional
bureaus might be best poised to address the relevant challenges.

Making every technology policy the responsibility of one under secretary
would not solve the State Department's current problems. Instead, it
would result in unclear prioritization, strained resources, and would
leave one leader handling two very different mission sets.

**[The Importance of Avoiding a Security-Focused Approach to
Cyberspace]{.underline}**

In creating a Bureau of International Cyberspace Policy, the State
Department should also avoid limiting that bureau's focus solely to
security-related matters. That was one of the flaws with the previous
administration's efforts to create the Bureau of Cyberspace Security and
Emerging Technologies. While that bureau never materialized, the
Government Accountability Office roundly criticized the State Department
for failing to provide data or evidence to support its plans and for its
lack of consultation with other federal agencies. Rep. Gregory Meeks,
the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, emphasized that the
proposed office would not have been in a position to "coordinate
responsibility for the security, economic, and human rights aspects of
cyber policy."

[**Any reorganization** of the **State** Department should ensure that
**diplomats** can take into account **all dimensions** ---
**political**, **economic**, **humanitarian**, and **security** --- of
**cyberspace policy** and elevate them within the
department]{.underline}. That would allow a new bureau to lead the way
in promoting a free and secure internet. Some of the [reform
proposals]{.underline} that have been put forward [reflect this
approach]{.underline}. For example, the Cyber Diplomacy Act, which has
already passed in the House, would create an ambassador-at-large
position, with rank equal to that of an assistant secretary, to lead a
new cyber bureau. That person would report to the under secretary for
political affairs or an official of higher rank, which leaves open the
possibility that the position would report directly to the secretary of
state or one of the department's two deputy secretaries. While some have
proposed the deputy secretary for management and resources for this
reporting chain, that position has a history of going unfilled, and
having a new cyberspace bureau report to it is a recipe for undercutting
the fledgling bureau before it can even get off the ground. A better
alternative would be to allow the State Department some flexibility in
determining a new bureau's reporting structure, which might include the
more natural choice of reporting to the other deputy secretary.

An overly narrow focus on security is not the only trap to avoid in
creating a new cyber bureau. Orienting it around the idea of strategic
competition with China would also be a problem. No doubt China will
remain a key driver of U.S. policy for years to come, but global threats
and opportunities may look very different in future decades than they do
now. Cyber diplomacy should not be oriented around one adversary
specifically and the structure and functioning of a new cyberspace
policy bureau should stand the test of time.

The Devil Is in the Details, But a Cyberspace Policy Bureau Is the Best
Approach

The unfortunate political reality is that reorganizing the State
Department is hard. That alone is not a reason to forgo reform, but it
does introduce constraints on what may be feasible. Any new office or
bureau will need leaders, but current law strictly limits the rank that
they can hold. Creating a new under secretary, or even a new assistant
secretary, would require significant changes to the State Department
Basic Authorities Act, and there is limited political momentum for that
particular undertaking. The law currently authorizes the appointment of
24 assistant secretaries and six under secretaries. Although the
Cyberspace Solarium Commission initially recommended creating an
assistant secretary position to lead a new cyber bureau --- and although
it has been clear for two decades that the State Department's structure
should be overhauled --- making such drastic changes to the necessary
legislation may be a nonstarter on Capitol Hill for the foreseeable
future. The Cyber Diplomacy Act provides the best available work-around
by placing an ambassador-at-large at the head of the new bureau,
ensuring that the position has the stature necessary for effective
leadership.

The new bureau would also have to contend with the challenges of
prioritization. The Cyber Diplomacy Act lists a wide variety of issues
--- including internet access, internet freedom, digital economy,
cybercrime, deterrence, and international responses to cyber threats ---
that would become a cyberspace bureau's responsibilities. Even without
giving it emerging technology topics to handle, consolidating just
cyberspace policy issues will require careful planning to determine
which pieces get pulled from existing bureaus. To allow a new bureau to
adequately deal with digital economy matters, for example, policymakers
would need to decide which aspects of that issue get moved from the
purview of the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs. The new bureau
would have a good case for inheriting responsibility for portfolios like
investment in information communications technology infrastructure
abroad, particularly as it relates to cyber security capacity building,
but there is a strong argument for other pieces like e-commerce to
remain in their existing homes. The more bearing a particular team's
work has on preserving an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure
internet, the more it should be considered a strong candidate for
incorporation into a new bureau.

Moving the responsibility for particular policy matters is not the only
tool available, however. The Cyber Diplomacy Act creates an avenue for
the new bureau's personnel to engage other State Department experts to
ensure that concerns like human rights, economic competitiveness, and
security have an influence on the development of U.S. cyber policy. The
proposed Cyberspace Policy Coordinating Committee would ensure that
officials at the assistant secretary level or higher from across the
department can weigh in on matters of concern for their respective
portfolios.

[[With]{.mark} a new **cyberspace policy bureau**]{.underline}, a
coordinating committee, [and [**enhancements** to **emerging

Priority Three: Address Emerging Technologies from a National Security
Perspective

As part of the Secretary's modernization efforts to address 21st Century
threats, [[the **T Family** is **important** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Department's [[efforts to address **emerging tech**]{.mark}nologies from
a national security perspective. That includes leading efforts [to
prevent]{.mark} the **[prolif]{.mark}**eration of these technologies
[for]{.mark} purposes related to **[w]{.mark}**eapons of
**[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction, delivery systems, and
destabilizing advanced conventional weapons, [to **enhance alliance
military cooperation** on these tech]{.mark}nologie[s]{.mark}, [and to
**develop appropriate norms**]{.mark} of responsible behavior regarding
their use]{.underline}. [T Bureaus will enhance their work on emerging
technology [with]{.mark} new offices and
**[expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Our [Bureaus are]{.underline} also [engaged in discussions
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} other [threats posed by emerging national
security challenges presented by new technologies such as **artificial
intelligence** (**[AI]{.mark}**)]{.underline}, quantum information
sciences, [and biotechnology]{.underline}, among others. We are looking
at ways in which these challenges can be addressed considering the
changing nature of the technology and threats posed by adversarial uses.
The PRC's Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which blurs the lines between
civil and military development, further compounds these challenges. [The
risk that sensitive technologies can be transferred via intangible means
make it [critical to]{.mark} conduct [outreach to **academia** and
**industry**]{.mark} and ensure proper vetting of foreign visitors and
students, so they do not contribute to programs of concern]{.underline}.

We will work to implement related national security-focused strategies
developed by the T Bureaus and including by supporting related
Department efforts in the United Nations. This work will focus on how
new technologies could present opportunities and risks to the security
of U.S. allies and partners.

The T Bureaus and I will also promote the use of norms of responsible
behavior or codes of conduct when promoting risk reduction in areas of
emerging technologies such as space. [AVC's Office of Emerging Security
Challenges has been **[consulting with allies]{.mark}** and partners [at
**multilateral forums** and **there is broad support for this
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other [areas where we will seek to
advance efforts [to **develop norms** of]{.mark} responsible behavior
include **[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**,
biotechnology]{.underline}, and quantum computing.

The U.S. is [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} part of the Group of
Governmental Experts (GGE) on emerging technologies [in the area of
**Lethal Autonomous Weapons** (**[LAWS]{.mark}**)]{.underline} under the
auspices of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW). In
March 2022, the U.S. Delegation submitted a proposal for consideration
by the GGE titled "Principles and Good Practices on Emerging
Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems"
cosponsored by delegations from a number of other countries. This
document builds on how International Humanitarian Law applies to LAWS
and proposes additional measures that will be discussed by the GGE in
July 2022. [I [will]{.mark} continue to support this
effort]{.underline}.

Priority Four: [[Protect and promote]{.mark} the [US and Allies
**Tech**]{.mark}**nological, [Military, and Economic
Advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}

American and allied technological advancements are core elements of the
U.S. industrial strategy and President Biden's key priorities, and the T
Family will continue efforts to keep such technology and advancements
from illegal acquisition. As noted, we are particularly concerned with
threats posed by the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion Strategy that will fuse
together its civilian economy and defense establishment so that advanced
and emerging technologies drive economic and military modernization
simultaneously.

The T Family has led U.S. participation in the four nonproliferation
export control regimes for over 30 years and is partnering with allies
and partners in other regional and bilateral efforts as we further build
on these coalitions to protect sensitive technologies from adversarial
acquisition and exploitation.

The T Family will also continue its updates to the U.S. Munitions List,
engaging foreign governments as well as industry and university partners
at home and at abroad to bolster their understanding on how to comply
with applicable U.S. export control regulations, and strengthen allies
and partners' end-use monitoring programs for U.S. defense articles and
services.

/GoGreen!

[The **[State]{.mark}** Department **[Should Lead on
AI]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Why is [**diplomacy** --- rather than **defense**]{.underline} or
industrial policy --- [the **right venue** for advancing a digital
democracy agenda]{.underline}, or something like it? Simply put, [the
multidimensional and transnational nature of **AI** requires an
**integrated, strategic approach**, and **[diplomats are uniquely
skilled]{.mark}** in making policy across these issues more than the sum
of their piecemeal parts]{.underline}. To channel former French Prime
Minister Georges Clemenceau, AI is too important to be left to the
generals --- or the technologists --- alone.

So far, most of the government's focus on AI has been through research
and development investments at the Defense Department, or through White
House Office of Science and Technology Policy efforts to capitalize on
it as an innovative economic windfall. Unfortunately, this approach ---
including [**[leaving]{.mark}** much of the intergovernmental
[**norm-setting on AI** to **peer-to-peer military** discussions]{.mark}
--- misses the strategic forest for the tactical trees. Issue-specific
approaches that target global AI only as a **military tool** or an
economic boon have two dangerous flaws: They largely [**ignore** **AI**
as a **human rights** issue, and forsake]{.mark} the potential for
**alliances** and **[issue-linkage across policy
areas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, existing efforts have failed
to leverage U.S. technological leadership to advance global norms
aligned with Western values, or to use foreign assistance to promote
inclusive digital development at scale.

[The **[State]{.mark}** Department's [diplomats maintain a **comparative
advantage**]{.mark} over interagency peers [in **remedying**]{.mark}
**exactly [these flaws]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Diplomats are skilled in
dealing with crosscutting global problems, and well suited to play a
leading, **orchestrating role** in advancing a concerted American vision
for AI across its economic, security, and human rights
aspects]{.underline}. In Washington, at their posts, and [in
multilateral organizations]{.underline}, diplomats spend much of their
days integrating peer agencies' competing perspectives to advance a
concerted U.S. agenda; leveraging instruments of national power such as
foreign aid, military assistance, or visa regulations to advance
disparate goals across different issues; and negotiating in bilateral
and multilateral fora on economic, political, human rights, and military
matters. [The **State** Department's **sustained leadership** in
international organizations, which will play a **major role** in
**digital tech**nology **governance**, is an additional **underutilized
advantage**]{.underline}. The White House is [**wrong not to include**
the **State** Department as a "**key agency**" in its strategy on
**AI**]{.underline}. In fact, the department may be the keystone agency
--- linking disparate, issue-specific efforts together so the result is
more than the sum of its parts.

From Data Diplomacy to Data-Driven Diplomacy

Beyond its leadership potential on AI as an international policy issue,
the State Department has three key advantages in applying AI
technologies to its way of working, increasing its value in the
interagency foreign policymaking process and reclaiming some of the
influence it has ceded to the Defense Department and National Security
Council in recent decades. First, the State Department has an exclusive,
novel dataset of millions of diplomatic cables representing a century of
collective knowledge of foreign governments and societies. Second, it
has a unique overseas infrastructure for overt information collection in
the form of embassies and diplomats. Third, it has one of the most
highly skilled workforces in the federal government, with incoming
Foreign Service officers having, on average, a master's degree and a
decade of work experience. By activating these assets and using AI as a
force multiplier, the department can contribute more to the interagency
policymaking process by bringing original and rigorous insights to
national security debates. America's oldest cabinet agency --- often
maligned as stuck in the past, pining for an imagined diplomatic golden
age and averse to technological reforms --- can reclaim leadership by
investing in AI as a tool for scenario planning, crisis response, and
innovative policy analysis. While frontier technologies will ultimately
find their way into most parts of how the department operates, there are
a few areas that are most important to prioritize in the near term to
deliver immediate impact.

Predictive platforms, similar to those commercially available in the
political risk industry today --- and some being prototyped by peer
agencies --- are remarkable in their ability to use micro-level data
(e.g., credit card purchases, social media posts, and search engine
trends) to predict macro-level geopolitical events in ways no humans on
their own could detect. Unfortunately, however, the State Department
today is unique among foreign affairs agencies in that it uses almost no
quantitative scenario modeling in its strategic planning, limiting the
utility of its crisis prediction or strategic planning based too often
on anecdote and experience without sufficiently testing hypotheses or
assumptions.

Peer agencies can point the way to a better process. For crisis
prediction, for example, the U.K. Foreign Office has built a platform to
automatically translate and analyze hundreds of thousands of hyperlocal
news sources to spot early warning signs of humanitarian crises and
violent extremism. For longer-term forecasting, the Intelligence
Advanced Research Projects Activity's Aggregative Contingent Estimation
program uses advanced analytics to aggregate not just data but the
wisdom of crowds: The program elicits judgments of event probabilities
from many intelligence analysts, and then uses algorithmic techniques to
weight them on factors like past performance and "cognitive style,"
providing more systematic estimates than any analyst could provide
individually. Even in the policymaking process, AI can greatly empower
human analysts by ingesting orders of magnitude more information and
applying human-defined rules and principles more consistently. Doing so
tests long-held assumptions, questions well-documented cognitive biases,
investigates patterns of history rather than relying on simple
analogies, and casts a wider aperture on sources of analysis like social
media, satellite imagery, and user-generated video content.

Where would the data feeding these prediction engines come from?
Fortunately, in the parlance of data science, the State Department sits
on top of a "novel data asset" --- a unique trove of data only it owns,
but which it has yet to fully leverage. For decades, the collective
knowledge of diplomats across the globe has been transcribed, shared,
and stored in cables. U.S. diplomats have documented everything from the
department's grand strategy to individual meetings with foreign
officials. This corpus of cables constitutes America's diplomatic
equivalent of a "knowledge graph," but unlike those that drive the
functionality behind Facebook and Google, it has never been fully
utilized to help diplomats do their jobs. Much foreign policy analysis
today involves manually traversing this knowledge graph by consuming
hundreds of cables a week, yielding a policy process overly reliant on
anecdote and predictably subject to human cognitive biases toward
action, "credibility" preservation, and parochial conceptions of
national interests. AI-powered capabilities such as enhanced search,
natural language processing, and natural language generation can augment
this type of work to help diplomats quickly make connections they would
otherwise not have discovered, such as by detecting patterns of state
behavior, analyzing past interactions with foreign leaders, and
evaluating alternative courses of action.

This is not to say that AI is a magic bullet in the craft of foreign
policymaking. Pattern recognition algorithms, for instance, can break
down in the face of truly unprecedented events. States' behavior often
results from the aggregation of thousands of individual decisions made
by idiosyncratic individuals in diverse settings, yielding wide error
bars in human- and machine-generated forecasts alike. Last but not
least, effective predictive engines depend on vast troves of
high-quality training data that require upfront investment to parse,
clean, and validate, challenges even the Defense Department --- with its
vast resources --- has handled far from perfectly.

Yet on the whole, advanced analytics can significantly augment, not
automate, traditional diplomatic tradecraft, putting the State
Department in a position to make first-in-class contributions to the
interagency policy process and allow its workforce to focus on
higher-value tasks. To consider a relatively low-tech example, if annual
publications like the Trafficking in Persons Report looked less like
300-page narrative PDFs and more like the Johns Hopkins University
COVID-19 Dashboard, State Department analysts could spend more time
explaining why trends and events happened rather than simply describing
what took place. Beyond tech upgrades, though, retooling the State
Department's hiring, training, and education practices to augment
diplomatic expertise with the insights of AI can multiply the value the
department brings to foreign policymaking.

Pathways to Change

Unfortunately, the State Department's current structure is not optimized
for its potential to lead on AI as a top-tier policy priority and
transformative way of working. As Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine
recently noted, [**[advanced tech]{.mark}**nology "is not simply a niche
functional issue buried in a crowded foreign policy agenda; it [is a
**central element** of]{.mark} modern **[geopolitical
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Indeed, [**reorienting** the
**State** Department and its people for great-power competition in the
realm of frontier technologies is a central thrust]{.underline} of the
second quarter report from the National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence, yet has received relatively little attention.
Across the Foreign Service --- traditionally generalist diplomats who
rotate between overseas and Washington assignments --- and Civil Service
--- typically Washington-based officials with relatively specialized
training and longer assignments --- reforms to mainstream AI, advanced
analytics, and frontier-technology fluency are ambitious yet achievable.

First, the State Department should accelerate structural changes that
elevate the importance of AI and related frontier-technology issues
across security, economic, and human rights siloes. Currently, cyber
policy (broadly defined) is handled by a special coordinator for cyber
issues in the Office of the Secretary of State. Last June, the
department proposed a new Bureau for Cybersecurity and Emerging
Technologies. However, progress in creating this new bureau has stalled,
with House Democrats placing a hold on its approval and the Government
Accountability Office noting faulting State for not including key
interagency stakeholders in its design. [Getting a Bureau for
Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies properly established as a
permanent home for diplomacy on advanced technological issues is a
start, but the new bureau will be housed under the undersecretary for
arms control and international security, potentially sidelining the
economic and human rights aspects of AI]{.underline}. Today, for
example, cybersecurity issues are handled by the coordinator for cyber
issues, while "critical communications infrastructure" issues are
overseen by the Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, bifurcating
interlocking topics along bureaucratic lines.

No bureaucratic structure is perfect, but [to **remedy this**, the State
Department should create a **permanent office for digital human rights**
in the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, and promote
frequent staff-level coordination across units like the Bureau for
Cybersecurity and Emerging Technologies and its economic and human
rights peers]{.underline}. Beyond a single focal point, though, [the
State Department should integrate or **mainstream AI and
frontier-technology diplomacy** throughout its work]{.underline}. Recent
proposals to do so include creating a "science cone" in the Foreign
Service, or having dedicated technology policy officers in each major
regional and functional bureau.

[Beyond structuring the State Department to lead on AI as a policy area,
training and professional education [**reforms** can better]{.mark}
prepare the diplomatic workforce to [reap the benefit of **AI**]{.mark}
as an analytic skill]{.underline}. Ultimately, the State Department's
most important asset is its people, and this workforce should see the
use of advanced analytics as a benefit and not a hindrance. When
incorporating new technologies into the work of the State Department,
senior officials should be hyperfocused on empowering America's
world-class professional diplomats, thereby saving time, delivering
novel insights, and serving as a foreign policy force multiplier.
Simultaneously, foreign service officers need to be afforded training
opportunities to understand the value of such tools to their day-to-day
activities and be incentivized professionally to gain new skills that
allow them to leverage technologies to make better decisions. Much as
nuclear physicists were deeply embedded in America's Iran deal
negotiating team to integrate the finer points of scientific specialty
with diplomatic expertise, 21st-century U.S. diplomats will need at
least "conversational analytics" to integrate the data-scientific and
geopolitical issues at the core of strategic competition between liberal
democracy and surveillance authoritarianism.

Historically, this type of specialization cuts against the cultural
grain at the State Department, which prides itself on adaptable
generalism and learning on the job, particularly in the Foreign Service.
Yet as several recent reports on the future of diplomacy have noted,
"breaking away from 'born, not made'" will be critical to equipping
diplomats for effective interagency leadership on transnational issues
of growing importance, and, as I've argued in the Foreign Service
Journal, is more in keeping with a history of diplomatic
professionalization than is typically assumed. AI and other growing
specialist demands can help push the department to better incorporate
professional education into diplomats' career trajectory, meeting the
moment by investing in its core asset: its people.

[No such transformation is possible without congressional resourcing and
executive sponsorship in the State Department. **[With some changes and
investments]{.mark}**, the **[State]{.mark}** Department [is **well
positioned** to]{.mark} promulgate [a **democratic digital
agenda**]{.mark} that is aligned with American values, and to use
investments in AI to transform its diplomatic and foreign policymaking
functions]{.underline}. When discussing AI and innovation in government,
it is common to fetishize technology and insist on its centrality to
transformation. However, technological innovations should come with
accompanying culture change, and leaders across the department should
define and communicate the value of these innovations to the mission of
diplomacy.

Skepticism towards technology is as old as the diplomatic profession
itself: Upon receiving his first telegraph message in the 1860s, British
Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, for example, exclaimed, "My God, this is
the end of diplomacy!" Yet when used properly, [[**AI** can
**empower**]{.mark} **(rather than replace)** career [**diplomacy like
never before**, putting **civilian**]{.mark} foreign policymaker[s
**back into the driver's seat**]{.mark} at home and overseas through
leadership on a major "gray rhino" security threat and improved
decision-making]{.underline}.

Priority Three: Address Emerging Technologies from a National Security
Perspective

As part of the Secretary's modernization efforts to address 21st Century
threats, [[the **T Family** is **important** to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
Department's [[efforts to address **emerging tech**]{.mark}nologies from
a national security perspective. That includes leading efforts [to
prevent]{.mark} the **[prolif]{.mark}**eration of these technologies
[for]{.mark} purposes related to **[w]{.mark}**eapons of
**[m]{.mark}**ass **[d]{.mark}**estruction, delivery systems, and
destabilizing advanced conventional weapons, [to **enhance alliance

**develop appropriate norms**]{.mark} of responsible behavior regarding
their use]{.underline}. [T Bureaus will enhance their work on emerging
technology [with]{.mark} new offices and
**[expertise]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Our [Bureaus are]{.underline} also [engaged in discussions
[on]{.mark}]{.underline} other [threats posed by emerging national
security challenges presented by new technologies such as artificial
intelligence (AI)]{.underline}, quantum information sciences, [and
**[biotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}, among others. We are looking at
ways in which these challenges can be addressed considering the changing
nature of the technology and threats posed by adversarial uses. The
PRC's Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which blurs the lines between
civil and military development, further compounds these challenges. [The
risk that sensitive technologies can be transferred via intangible means
make it [critical to]{.mark} conduct [outreach to **academia** and
**industry**]{.mark} and ensure proper vetting of foreign visitors and
students, so they do not contribute to programs of concern]{.underline}.

We will work to implement related national security-focused strategies
developed by the T Bureaus and including by supporting related
Department efforts in the United Nations. This work will focus on how
new technologies could present opportunities and risks to the security
of U.S. allies and partners.

The T Bureaus and I will also promote the use of norms of responsible
behavior or codes of conduct when promoting risk reduction in areas of
emerging technologies such as space. [AVC's Office of Emerging Security
Challenges has been **[consulting with allies]{.mark}** and partners [at
**multilateral forums** and **there is broad support for this
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other [areas where we will seek to
advance efforts [to **develop norms** of]{.mark} responsible behavior
include artificial intelligence,
**[biotech]{.mark}nology**]{.underline}, and quantum computing.

The U.S. is also part of the Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) on
emerging technologies in the area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS)
under the auspices of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW). In March 2022, the U.S. Delegation submitted a proposal for
consideration by the GGE titled "Principles and Good Practices on
Emerging Technologies in the Area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems"
cosponsored by delegations from a number of other countries. This
document builds on how International Humanitarian Law applies to LAWS
and proposes additional measures that will be discussed by the GGE in
July 2022. [I [will]{.mark} continue to support this
effort]{.underline}.

Priority Four: [[Protect and promote]{.mark} the [US and Allies
**Tech**]{.mark}**nological, [Military, and Economic
Advantages]{.mark}**]{.underline}

American and allied technological advancements are core elements of the
U.S. industrial strategy and President Biden's key priorities, and the T
Family will continue efforts to keep such technology and advancements
from illegal acquisition. As noted, we are particularly concerned with
threats posed by the PRC's Military-Civil Fusion Strategy that will fuse
together its civilian economy and defense establishment so that advanced
and emerging technologies drive economic and military modernization
simultaneously.

The T Family has led U.S. participation in the four nonproliferation
export control regimes for over 30 years and is partnering with allies
and partners in other regional and bilateral efforts as we further build
on these coalitions to protect sensitive technologies from adversarial
acquisition and exploitation.

The T Family will also continue its updates to the U.S. Munitions List,
engaging foreign governments as well as industry and university partners
at home and at abroad to bolster their understanding on how to comply
with applicable U.S. export control regulations, and strengthen allies
and partners' end-use monitoring programs for U.S. defense articles and
services.

Department of State

[[The **biological nonprolif**]{.mark}eration activities of the
Department [of **State** are of **special
importance**]{.mark}]{.underline} for two reasons. [First, the
department [has the **most extensive activities of any organization
worldwide**]{.mark} designed explicitly [to address
**biosecurity**]{.mark} threats]{.underline} in developing countries
outside the FSU. [It has pioneered working with]{.underline} developing
[countries in this field [and]{.mark} has **significant budgetary
resources** to this end]{.underline}, with about \$25 million focused on
developing countries outside the FSU during FY 2008 and a comparable
amount set aside for FY 2009. [Second, the department [has a **lead role
in the interagency process**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Washington, [which
is designed to coordinate government-wide approaches to
biosecurity]{.underline} in the developing countries. This
responsibility is also discussed in Chapter 5. [Thus, it [has]{.mark}
both **[experience]{.mark}** and a **mandate** that are [of
**considerable importance**]{.mark}]{.underline} as BTRP begins to
expand into developing countries beyond the FSU.

Geographically, engagement efforts are focused on areas where the
department considers that there is the greatest biological risk, with
substantial efforts under way in South and Southeast Asia, particularly
Pakistan, Indonesia, and the Philippines, as well as in the Middle East.
These regions will probably continue to be of high priority in FY 2009.
The program is expanding regionally to cover areas in Africa and Latin
America, as well as continuing efforts in Eurasia. The department has
established field offices in Manila, Jakarta, and Islamabad, with a
regional training hub planned for Thailand.

Global assistance is directed in the following areas:

• [[Strengthening lab]{.mark}oratory [biosafety]{.mark} and biosecurity,
including best practices, standard operating procedures, personnel
reliability programs, and enhanced physical security
measures]{.underline}

• Ensuring safe, secure, and sustainable laboratory buildings,
education, planning, management, and operations

• [[Enhancing]{.mark} molecular [diagnostics and disease
surveillance]{.mark} networks]{.underline}

• [[Fostering collaborative research]{.mark} projects in priority areas
to engage scientists and promote sustainable implementation]{.underline}

• [Advancing host-nation commitments to the International Health
Regulations]{.underline} (IHR), particularly as they pertain to best
practices, laboratory capacity development, and areas surrounding
laboratory biosafety and biosecurity

• [[Promoting global coop]{.mark}eration [on]{.mark} biosecurity
standards, [regulations]{.mark}, and legislation]{.underline}

Department of Defense (**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [**[security
coop]{.mark}eration** activities]{.underline} support or are combined
with other assistance programs and often [are a part of nation
assistance]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} often occurs in a manner
that [may **appear confusing** or convoluted]{.underline} to the joint
warfighter. This article portrays how the programs and activities
converge. [Although the various **terms** and activities in show in the
accompanying figure **appear** to have **simple names and meanings**,
they [**in fact** have **strict definitions based on funding and
authorities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some of the activities
directly support one another, others [have **[distinct
boundaries]{.mark}** between their definitions and
functions]{.underline}. The joint community is beginning to address the
framework of security cooperation in a new joint doctrine publication,
Joint Publication (JP) 3-XX, Security Cooperation. [[It is **important**
to embark with **clear definitions**]{.mark} and understanding of the
complex relationship among these terms [to **facilitate
understanding**]{.mark}]{.underline} by the joint force.

Security cooperation is referred to in both joint professional military
education programs and joint staffs as a tool to be employed by
combatant commands. However, in other settings, it is a set of programs
managed by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. Extensive review of
joint doctrine and policy reveals that the definition of security
cooperation appears to encompass these areas and more. After expanding
our understanding of security cooperation, other terms such as security
force assistance, foreign internal defense, and security assistance
provide additional specificity for the tasks being conducted, yet some
of these actions fall outside security cooperation. [Even though
**[security coop]{.mark}eration** spans the range of military operations
and is inclusive of large-scale operations conducted in support of
foreign nations, it [is **not**]{.mark} all-[encompassing of security
related support from]{.mark} U.S. **[agencies other than
DOD]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Nation assistance is support rendered by foreign forces within another
nation's territory based on mutual agreements.1 While this term is used
to describe the comprehensive approach to assisting other nations, the
definition associated with nation assistance has two limitations: it
does not encompass support to regional organizations, and it is only
assistance by foreign forces. A better, broader term is foreign
assistance, which is assistance to foreign nations ranging from the sale
of military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
survivors of natural and manmade disasters.2 When examining the current
definitions for foreign assistance and nation assistance, we find
significant overlap:

Foreign assistance to foreign nations \[ranges\] from the sale of
military equipment to donations of food and medical supplies to aid
survivors of natural and man-made disasters. U.S. foreign assistance
takes three forms: development assistance, humanitarian assistance, and
security assistance.3

This term is likely to resonate with the State Department, which has an
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance and a designated foreign assistance
budget.

Nation assistance---assistance rendered to a nation by foreign forces
within that nation's territory based on agreements mutually concluded
between nations.4

The term nation assistance is not often used in policy or strategy. For
example, the current National Security Strategy mentions foreign
assistance three times but does not use the term nation assistance. The
first opportunity to create some clarity is to replace the term nation
assistance with foreign assistance in the upcoming revisions of JP 3-0,
Joint Operations, and JP 3-22, Foreign Internal Defense.

If foreign assistance were to replace nation assistance in joint
doctrine, the definition would include that portion of security
cooperation that falls outside the realm of nation assistance in
figure 1. Foreign assistance then encompasses all of security
cooperation and reduces some of the ambiguity. Security cooperation then
focuses strictly on the DOD contribution to foreign assistance and
encompasses all DOD interactions with foreign defense establishments to
build both national and regional defense relationships that promote
specific U.S. security interests, develop allied and friendly military
capabilities for self-defense and multinational operations, and provide
U.S. forces with peacetime and contingency access to host nations.5

Having addressed the larger constructs, it is possible to review and
clarify the relationships between other programs and activities that
occur within them. First is [[**security assistance** with a **specific
definition**]{.mark} in relation to both DOD and State. It [refers
to]{.mark} a group of programs authorized by the Foreign Assistance
Act]{.underline} of 1961, as amended, [and the Arms Export Control
Act]{.underline} of 1976, as amended. [These [programs]{.mark} are
**[funded and authorized by State]{.mark}** to be **[administered by
DOD]{.mark}** through the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency]{.underline}.6 This is the process by which the United States
provides defense articles, military training, and other defense-related
services. [That portion of **[security assistance]{.mark}** [**outside**
of **security coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline} in figure 1
[[reflects **State** and other **civilian agency
involvement**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Even if that's not in the plan text, perms can be extra-topical but NOT non-topical

#### That's [best for debate]{.underline}:

#### 1 -- [predictable ground]{.underline} -- the [breadth]{.underline} of [SC content]{.underline} is [unpredictably broad]{.underline}, criticism is [rarely mission-specific]{.underline}, and [NATO bad]{.underline} and [tech bad]{.underline} lose to thumpers without counterplans that the topic makes [permable!]{.underline} -- [DoD authority]{.underline} is the [only predictable]{.underline} definitional element

Definitions and Scope

To pursue this analysis, we first had to define the bounds of what we
would assess. [**Official U.S. [government definitions]{.mark}** [of
**security cooperation** are **very broad**]{.mark}]{.underline}. One
definition from [the D]{.underline}efense [S]{.underline}ecurity
[C]{.underline}ooperation [A]{.underline}gency [states that security
cooperation]{.underline}

> comprises all activities undertaken by the Department of Defense (DoD)
> to encourage and enable international partners to work with the United
> States to achieve strategic objectives. It [[includes **all DoD
> interactions** with foreign]{.mark} defense and [security
> establishments]{.mark}]{.underline}, including all DoD-administered
> Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense and security
> relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests, including all
> international armaments cooperation activities and SA activities;
> develop allied and friendly military capabilities for self-defense and
> multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and
> contingency access to host nations.3

[Such definitions **[clearly include]{.mark}** almost [**any
security-related activity** for **any purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
scope the focus of the study, [we reviewed official **state documents**
and strategies and the **literature** on security cooperation to
identify]{.underline} 11 types of activities**[:]{.underline}**

1\. **[military aid]{.underline}**, which includes funding through the
Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, the Excess Defense Articles
program, and other grants and loans

2\. **[arms sales]{.underline}** and transfers,4 such as U.S. arms sales
through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Direct Commercial Sales
(DCS) programs

3\. military capacity-building, such as U.S. activities under Section
1206 of the annual National Defense Authorization Act and Sections and
2282 and 333 of U.S. Code, Title 10 (the **[train and
equip]{.underline}** authority)

4\. **[education and training]{.underline}**, including international
military education and training (IMET), professional military education
(PME), and regional centers

5\. **[personnel exchanges]{.underline}**, such as U.S. activities under
the Military Personnel Exchange Program and the State Partnership
Program

6\. **[military exercises]{.underline}**, both bilateral and
multilateral and those that involve foreign partners

7\. access-related agreements, such as status of forces agreements
(**[SOFAs]{.underline}**) and agreements related to base access [and
**information-sharing**]{.underline}

8\. armament-related agreements, such as those for
**[co-development]{.underline}** of systems and for research,
development, test, and evaluation activities

9\. **[sustainment]{.underline}** of donor-nation equipment by the
donor, the partner, or third parties

10\. **[institutional capacity--building]{.underline}** to strengthen
the partner institutions that support security services

11\. [**humanitarian assistance** and **disaster relief**]{.underline}
(HA/DR), which offers support for efforts to relieve suffering.

[These categories offered a consistent template for gathering
data]{.underline} across our various study components. A major challenge
was that reliable and consistent data on each of the 11 categories were
not available for all the competitors---not even for the United States.
[**[Especially]{.mark}** at the **[unclassified]{.mark}** level,
**[there is]{.mark} simply [no comprehensive roster]{.mark} of security
cooperation activities** by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, and neither China nor Russia publishes inclusive
data sets of its programs. An additional challenge was that, in some
cases, the different countries define the categories somewhat
differently, so we could not develop data on entirely comparable sets of
security cooperation activities.

Interagency Terminology

Discussion of military and related assistance to foreign countries is
sometimes hindered by a lack of a standard terminology.9 The following
terms are frequently used to describe assistance to foreign governments,
security services, and militaries:

- **[Security Assistance (Title 22)]{.underline}**. Although not defined
  in Title 22 of U.S. Code, [the term **security assistance** is
  commonly used to refer to the six budget accounts for which the
  **State Department** requests international security assistance
  appropriations and whose underlying authorities reside in the Foreign
  Assistance Act]{.underline} of 1961 (**[FAA]{.underline}**, P.L.
  87-195) [and Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} in 1976
  (**[AECA]{.underline}**, P.L. 90-629), as amended.**[10]{.underline}**

**\[FOOTNOTE 10\]**

**[10]{.underline}** [[**Security assistance** is]{.mark} also **[used
as a generic term]{.mark}** used throughout the U.S. government to
describe assistance provided to foreign military and security forces,
**[regardless of the agency]{.mark}** providing that
assistance]{.underline}. The annual State Department congressional
budget justification (CBJ) identifies six budget accounts under the
heading "International Security Assistance," which are commonly referred
to as the State Department's security assistance portfolio.

[**DOD** also uses the term **security assistance** to **refer
specifically to a group of State Department programs** authorized by
the]{.underline} Foreign Assistance Act of 1961(**[FAA]{.underline}**)
[and]{.underline} Arms Export Control Act (**[AECA]{.underline}**),
[funded by State Department appropriations and **managed by** the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency (**DSCA**)]{.underline}, an agency
under the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Policy (OSD)(P).

**\[/FOOTNOTE 10\]**

- **[Security Cooperation (Title 10)]{.underline}**. DOD uses [the term
  **[security coop]{.mark}eration**]{.underline} to [[refer to]{.mark}
  activities authorized by provisions in **Title 10** and National
  Defense Authorization Acts (NDAAs)]{.underline}. The FY2017 NDAA
  [defines security cooperation as "[**any** program]{.mark}, activity
  (including an exercise), or interaction [of]{.mark} the
  **[D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efense** with the security
  establishment of a foreign country to achieve a purpose as
  follows:]{.underline}

- [To build and develop allied and friendly security capabilities for
  self-defense and multinational operations]{.underline}.

- [To provide the armed forces with access to the foreign country during
  peacetime or a contingency operation]{.underline}.

- [To build relationships that promote specific U]{.underline}nited
  [S]{.underline}tates [security interests]{.underline}."11

- **[Security Sector Assistance]{.underline}**. In April 2013, the Obama
  Administration issued Presidential Decision Directive 23 (PPD-23). The
  directive called for an overhaul of U.S. security sector assistance
  policy and for the creation of a new interagency framework for
  planning, implementing, assessing, and overseeing security sector
  assistance. [The term **security sector [assistance]{.mark}** [refers
  to **all State**]{.mark} Department **security assistance** [programs
  and]{.mark} virtually **all [DOD]{.mark}** **security cooperation**
  programs, exercises, and engagements, as well as related activities of
  the [**USAID**, **DOJ**, and **other

A. "Security Sector Assistance" as an Umbrella Term

[The]{.underline} foundational and initial [task of
**[defining]{.mark}**]{.underline} "security sector assistance" and the
related terms ["security assistance" and "security cooperation" [is
**not simple**, with **different** **branches** and **agencies**]{.mark}
of the **U.S. government** **[defining]{.mark}** and applying **the
[terms differently]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This can [**make it
difficult to coherently discuss** the **respective responsibilities**
of]{.mark} the various executive **[agencies]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
identify where TCA ends and statutory authorities begin.

As a starting point, presidential policy, defined "security sector
assistance" as any U.S. Government "policy, program, \[or\] activity"
used to:

Engage with foreign partners and help shape their policies and actions
in the security sector;

Help foreign partners build and sustain the capacity and effectiveness
of legitimate institutions to provide security, safety, and justice for
their people; \[or\],

Enable foreign partners to contribute to efforts that address common
security challenges. 129

Under this definition, "security sector assistance" includes the
relevant policies, programs, or activities of any executive agency.
Complicating matters, though, Congress has considered a proposed
definition for "security sector assistance" that, in contrast to the
presidential policy definition, 130 encompasses DoS programs, but not
DoD or other executive agency programs. 131 In addition, [[**Congress**
has **defined "security cooperation"** as **DoD
specific**]{.underline}]{.mark}, 132 [[but]{.mark} it [has **not defined
"security assistance."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The **[DoD]{.underline}** adheres to the presidential policy definition
and further [defines "security cooperation" as all its relationship
building and foreign partner development activities, including "security
assistance," which the DoD defines as a subset of security cooperation
that is funded and authorized by the DoS and administered by the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency]{.underline}. 133 [The **[DoS]{.mark}**, on
the other hand, uses the term "security assistance" in a manner that
**[contradicts]{.mark} the [DoD's definition]{.mark}**]{.underline},
employing it to describe any DoS or DoD assistance to foreign military
or other security forces. 134

[[To synthesize]{.mark} these definitions]{.underline}, and
**[[consistent with]{.underline}]{.mark}** presidential
**[[policy]{.underline}]{.mark}**, this article uses [the term "security
sector assistance"]{.underline} to [[mean:]{.mark} (**[1]{.mark}**)
**[DoS approved, funded, and administered "security
assistance;"]{.mark}** (**[2]{.mark}**) **[DoD approved, funded, and
administered "security cooperation;"]{.mark}** and (**[3]{.mark}**)
[**hybrid security assistance/cooperation**, **approved and funded by
the DoS**, **but administered by the DoD**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 135

#### Worst-case, their definition [only redefines the counterplan text]{.underline} to mean it is [NOT administered]{.underline} by DoD, BUT [still competes]{.underline}

National Defense University, "Defense Institution Building in the U.S.
Context," Connections, 17(3), Summer-Fall 2018, pp.23-38, JSTOR
/GoGreen!

Finally, [in the U.S. government, [**"security cooperation"** and
**"security assistance"**]{.mark}]{.underline}---which are the chief
lines of effort in the U.S. toolkit to help partners bolster their
security and work with the United States to support common security
objectives---[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} overlapping but
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily
**[[interchangeable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The
**distinction**]{.mark} between **"security cooperation"** and
**"security assistance"** activities [has to do with the **agency
administering**]{.mark} the program: in simplest terms, [it is
**either**]{.mark} an activity of the **[D]{.mark}**epartment
**[o]{.mark}**f **[D]{.mark}**efense (**security cooperation**)
**[or]{.mark}** the **[D]{.mark}**epartment **[o]{.mark}**f
**[S]{.mark}**tate (**security assistance**)]{.underline}.

DOD and the Department of State (DOS) have shared responsibility for
engaging with foreign partner militaries since the mid-twentieth
century, with the bulk of congressional security assistance funding
allocated to DOS. Any security assistance administered by DOD---whether
funded under Title 10 (Armed Services) or Title 22 (Foreign Affairs) of
the U.S. Code---is a "security cooperation" activity.21 After the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the legal framework for the
funding and administration of such activities evolved in response to
emerging threats. Congress increasingly granted funding and authorities
directly to DOD under Title 10 for security cooperation.22 Therefore,
while DOS security assistance programs can include DIB components, the
majority of DIB-specific programming is currently funded under and
implemented by the Department of Defense and is thus considered security
cooperation.

C. Evolving Terminology for Peacetime Engagements

Military operations of any scale require precise language to communicate
information efficiently.\[82\] Common sense dictates that terms and
concepts applicable to a joint environment are standard and well-known
between the services in order to foster efficient communication.
Confusion and general misunderstandings result when military terms are
used improperly or when their evolving definitions outpace doctrine. The
[DoD recognizes the importance of standardizing its
terminology]{.underline} by instructing the military departments to
identify, delete, modify, and incorporate standard definitions.\[83\]
[Nonetheless, the **misuse** and **misunderstanding** of key terms
within **security cooperation** is **pervasive**]{.underline}.\[84\]

[Security cooperation is now a term that encompasses "any program,
activity]{.underline} (including an exercise), [or interaction of the
\[DoD\] with the security establishment of a foreign
country]{.underline} to achieve a \[strategic\] purpose . . .
\[.\]"\[85\] The DoD assigns such strategic importance to security
cooperation that, with the help of Congress, it created the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) to direct and guide the execution of
all DoD security cooperation programs.\[86\] The DSCA helps administer
security cooperation, now a multi-billion dollar industry within the
annual Defense appropriation.\[87\] With all the money and strategic
brainpower pouring into security cooperation, [newcomers to the field
[may **presume**]{.mark} **fully-vetted, [standardized terms]{.mark}**
and definitions. However, [this **could not be further from
reality**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Members of the [**DoD** **frequently mischaracterize**
**s**]{.mark}**ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation** [or **outright disagree**
with]{.mark} respect to [its **doctrinal
definition**]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[88\] For example, the 2010 National
Security Strategy (NSS) used the term security cooperation to include
rebuilding damaged infrastructure and establishing conditions necessary
to end military operations in Afghanistan.\[89\] [With the exception of
combat operations, it [would seem]{.mark} that almost [**any military
action** could fit]{.mark} under the]{.underline} 2010 NSS's [version of
**security cooperation**]{.underline}.\[90\] Nevertheless, if
[**[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation** [is **in fact** **an
evolving term in the DoD**]{.mark}]{.underline}, making sense of the
authorities under which the military executes security cooperation
events is even more troublesome.\[91\] This is especially true when
authorities are based upon a set of specific terms. Hence, [with
**doctrine lagging** behind and accompanied by **undefined
terminology**, **no [authority in]{.mark} the realm of [s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation [is]{.mark} more [ambiguous]{.mark}** than the
authority for military-to-military contacts]{.underline}.\[92\] With
ambiguity surrounding military-to-military contacts, planners and
lawyers should defer to commanders to decide the best way to employ
these strategic interaction events. The fate of 10 U.S.C. §168 and its
ultimate repeal is illustrative of this point.

It is an oft-repeated mantra that in order to defeat transnational
terrorism, and by extension other related non-state threats, the United
States must apply all the elements of national power, including
diplomatic, informational, military, and economic.34 The OSD SCG directs
that DOD Security Cooperation "will be integrated with other elements of
national power...in order to achieve national security, defense, and
foreign policy objectives."35 This formulation, while helpful, obscures
two key facts. First, Security Cooperation includes activities that by
their very nature involve the simultaneous application of more than one
element of national power. Security Cooperation at a minimum requires
the combination of diplomatic relations, military assistance,
military-to-military contacts, and public diplomacy. In other words,
Security Cooperation is itself an application of at least three of the
classic elements of national power.36 Second, DOD is not the only entity
in the USG that interacts with foreign governments to achieve the stated
objectives: relationships, capabilities, information and intelligence,
and access. The Department of State, the Intelligence Community, and to
a lesser extent, other departments and agencies, conduct activities
aimed at the accomplishment of these objectives, broadly understood.
**[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [**[no common
USG]{.mark}**, or interagency, **[definition]{.mark}**]{.underline} or
concept [[of **Security Coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}.37 We
will return to this issue in the final section of this paper. For the
purposes of the present discussion, this paper offers the following
working definition of Security Cooperation:

Security Cooperation refers to all USG assistance provided to foreign
law enforcement, security, and defense establishments in support of
national defense, security, and foreign policy
objectives.**[38]{.underline}**

**\[FOOTNOTE 38\]**

**[38]{.underline}** The [[application]{.mark} of the **Security
Cooperation** paradigm [to the **entire USG** **requires a precise
definition**]{.mark} **of security**]{.underline}. [**[Defined too
broadly, S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}ooperation [would simply be a
surrogate for foreign policy]{.mark}**. **[Limiting]{.mark}** the
objectives [to **specific enumerated**]{.mark} defense]{.underline} and
security [**[objectives]{.mark}** and assistance to foreign
establishments playing a role in national security or defense [is
**necessary to circumscribe the issue adequately**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Current security policy decision-making perpetuates the status quo. [The
current system perpetuates an ineffective status quo, whereby [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates often
[**[fails to effectively exert]{.mark} significant [diplomatic leverage
that it has through security assistance]{.mark}** [because]{.mark} the
bureaucratic structure to administer it---both within the State
Department and between the State Department and [the
**DOD**]{.mark}---is not designed to advance diplomatic efforts but
merely to administer appropriated funds]{.underline}.9 [This [makes it
challenging to change]{.mark} security assistance programs given
shifting foreign policy dynamics or changes in a partner's behavior that
may make them a less suitable recipient of U.S. security aid, such as
**[democratic backsliding]{.mark}**]{.underline} or a pattern of human
rights abuses.

U.S. [engagement with partners could be dominated by military issues if
**[foreign officials turn to DOD]{.mark} counterparts [instead]{.mark}
of diplomats** for assistance resources]{.underline}. Because the DOD
controls its own security assistance accounts, **[[other]{.mark} foreign
policy [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}** may [**[get trumped]{.mark}** if
partners go around the State Department to get aid from the
Pentagon]{.underline}. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-MD) worried at a 2017 Senate
Foreign Relations Committee hearing that the shift to **[[increasing DOD
authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}** could "[**[send a]{.mark} fundamental
[message]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the United States [considers
security]{.mark} relationships [over]{.mark} all other U.S. foreign
policy objectives or concerns, including human rights or good
**[governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}."10 Under the current framework,
[the State Department's **[ability to put the brakes on
s]{.mark}ecurity**]{.underline} assistance or military
[**[c]{.mark}ooperation** [under **DOD**]{.mark} authorities [is
**highly limited**]{.mark}]{.underline} because the State Department
does not control implementation and can often only approve or disapprove
of DOD proposals. [While State Department officials and ambassadors can
and sometimes do halt or temper problematic efforts, doing so
**[requires]{.mark} exerting significant [p]{.mark}olitical
[c]{.mark}apital** that is **[in short supply]{.mark}**]{.underline}.11
[[**Centralizing control** at]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}** Department
would]{.underline} help to [[**fix** this]{.mark} bureaucratic imbalance
between diplomacy and the Pentagon]{.underline}.

[**Defense priorities** often **undervalue** **democrati**c]{.underline}
and human rights [concerns]{.underline}. [Compared with the State
Department, the DOD is less equipped to effectively weigh]{.underline}
human rights concerns in its decision-making. [This **makes it harder to
leverage** U.S. military cooperation for economic or **political
concessions** or changes that might bolster **democratic
goals**]{.underline}. For example, U.S. military objectives to counter
terrorist groups in Somalia called for continuously supplying Uganda
with U.S. assistance despite growing human rights and democracy
concerns.12 [**Putting the State Department in charge would make it
easier** to realign U.S. security assistance toward democratic
states]{.underline} and effectively consider human rights issues in
every security assistance decision.

Contributes to an inefficient bureaucracy and coordination nightmare

[[Because]{.underline}]{.mark} of the patchwork of existing authorities
to provide security assistance, [[there are **multiple systems**]{.mark}
for]{.underline} U.S. [officials]{.underline} in Washington
[and]{.underline} on the ground in [embassies to manage]{.underline}.
For the security assistance system to work effectively, U.S. officials
at the [State]{.underline} Department, the [Pentagon, and]{.underline}
in [the field **need to closely coordinate**---**but** this does
**not**]{.underline} always [**happen** in the current
structure]{.underline}. [Military officers]{.underline} conducting and
[implementing security assistance have to juggle multiple]{.underline}
security assistance programs with different types of reporting
[requirements]{.underline}, human rights vetting standards, [and
administrative barriers, while also being [beholden to **two chains of
command**]{.mark}---the ambassador and the combatant
command---[with]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes **[[divergent
perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Many [programs are [supposed to be **dual key**]{.mark} and require
signoff from both]{.underline} the secretary of [defense
and]{.underline} secretary of [state. [**But** **because**]{.mark} **the
[DOD owns]{.mark} the [authority]{.mark}**[, their control over]{.mark}
the [direction]{.mark} of the program **[exceeds]{.mark}** the
**[State]{.mark}** Department['s]{.mark} capacity and available
[**political influence** to shape programs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A
C]{.underline}ongressional [R]{.underline}esearch [S]{.underline}ervice
[report found that **[in practice]{.mark}**,]{.underline} "many more
projects are submitted by the Combatant Commands than by embassy
staff."78 [The resource imbalance between the DOD and the State
Department]{.underline} also [affects coordination]{.underline}; for
example, State Department officials usually only see planned Section 333
activities when the DOD transmits a hefty tranche of proposals for a
14-day concurrence---hardly a joint planning process.79 This [leaves the
**[State]{.mark}** Department in a position where, if it **[cannot
persuade]{.mark} the [DOD]{.mark}** of the merits of any particular
concerns, it must either sign off on the package or [risk an
**interagency battle** over **one minor piece**]{.mark} of
it]{.underline}. Doing [the latter not only puts the State Department in
a very tough bureaucratic position vis-a-vis the DOD, but it can also be
hard to convince a secretary of state that the objection is worth the
battle with their DOD counterpart]{.underline}. This suggests that [DOD
programs, **[even if dual key]{.mark}**, are [likely to reflect
**military**]{.mark} considerations and [**priorities**, **regardless of
intentions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Overview

[Protecting]{.underline} Americans [from **terrorist attacks** within
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [depends, to a
great extent, on U.S. **success overseas**]{.underline}. The task is
vast and worldwide. [It requires enlisting host country police to track
and capture terrorists, uncovering terrorist financing, sharing
intelligence with foreign partners, strengthening border surveillance in
remote and unpopulated regions and building partnerships with foreign
militaries]{.underline}. In the longer run, it requires convincing
entire societies to reject terrorist propaganda and recruitment. A
successful counterterrorism policy depends on strong relationships with
foreign governments and the people residing in countries on every
continent.

[**Embassies** are on the **frontline** in the overseas campaign against
terror and demands on ambassadors, staffs, and physical facilities have
increased exponentially]{.underline}. Since September 11, 2001,
embassies have hosted a continuing influx of inter-agency personnel
tasked with the full range of counterterrorism activities.

Under the direction of Chairman Richard G. Lugar, Senate Foreign
Relations Committee majority staff visited selected embassies in Africa,
Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as the headquarters of
four combatant commands, to focus specifically on the civilian/military
nexus. He asked staff to assess whether the State and Defense
Departments are working together overseas in a way that contributes to
overarching U.S. foreign policy goals in the individual countries and in
the regions.

FINDINGS

1\. [The number of military personnel and **Defense Department**
activities in non-combat countries is **increasing significantly**.
[Left unclear, **blurred lines of authority** between]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department [and]{.mark} the **[Defense]{.mark}**
Department]{.underline} could [[lead to]{.mark} **interagency [turf
wars]{.mark}** [that **undermine**]{.mark} the effectiveness of [the
**overall**]{.mark} **U.S. [effort]{.mark} against terrorism**. It is in
the embassies]{.underline} rather than in Washington [where interagency
differences on strategies, tactics and divisions of labor are
increasingly adjudicated]{.underline}.

2\. While finding, capturing, and eliminating individual terrorists and
their support networks is an imperative in the war against terror, [it
is repairing and building alliances, pursuing resolutions to regional
conflicts, [fostering **democracy**]{.mark} and development, and
defusing religious extremism worldwide that will overcome the terrorist
threat]{.underline} in the long-term. It has traditionally been the
military\'s mission to take direct action against U.S. adversaries while
the civilian agencies\' mission has been to pursue non-coercive measures
through diplomacy, international information programming, and foreign
and economic assistance. [As a result of inadequate funding for civilian
programs, however, U.S. **[defense]{.mark} agencies** are
[increasingly]{.mark} being **[granted authority]{.mark} and funding [to
fill]{.mark} perceived [gaps]{.mark}**. Such [**bleeding** of]{.mark}
civilian [responsibilities]{.mark} overseas [**from civilian to military
agencies** risks **weakening**]{.mark} the Secretary of [**State\'s
primacy** in **setting the agenda**]{.mark} for U.S. relations with
foreign countries and the Secretary of Defense\'s focus on war
fighting]{.underline}.

3\. [The increases of funding streams, self-assigned missions, and
realigned authorities for the Secretary of Defense and the combatant
commanders are **[placing new stresses on]{.mark} inter-agency
[coordination in the field]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Currently,
overlapping missions and inter-agency frictions are, for the most part,
refereed by the U.S. ambassador and other State Department leadership in
the embassy with intermittent referral to headquarters for guidance.
But, [**[as the role of the military expands]{.mark}**, particularly
[in]{.mark} the area of **[foreign assistance]{.mark}**, embassy
officials]{.underline} in some countries [question whether the
Department of **Defense [will]{.mark} chafe under the constraints of
State Department leadership** and **[work for still more
authority]{.mark} and funding**]{.underline}.

4\. [There is **evidence** that some [**host countries** are]{.mark}
**questioning the increasingly military component** of America\'s
profile overseas]{.underline}. Some foreign officials question what
appears to them as a new emphasis by the United States on military
approaches to problems that are not seen as lending themselves to
military solutions. Host country militaries clearly welcome increased
professional contact and interaction with the U.S. military. However,
some [host countries have elements in both government and general
society who are **[highly suspicious]{.mark}** of potential American
coercion]{.underline}. There is no sense so far that foreign hosts
believe the U.S. military is dominating U.S. policy in-country, but
[**if [such a perception]{.mark} were to gain hold**, it would **[give
ammunition to]{.mark} U.S. [adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More
importantly, [it would **[weaken]{.mark}** the **bilateral
[relationships]{.mark}** that are **necessary to win the war against
terror**]{.underline}. Likewise, [**one** misstep or **poorly calculated
military** or other **operation** can significantly **set back the full
range of U.S. counterterrorism efforts** in an entire
region]{.underline}.

Catalytic nuclear attack [**[Catalytic nuclear attack]{.mark}** is a
metaphor for the]{.underline} possible [malevolent third party who sets
out to **induce a nuclear war** between]{.underline} two other [nuclear
weapons states]{.underline}. It is based on a metaphor drawn from
chemistry whereby a catalyst increases the rate of chemical reaction
without catalyst itself being destroyed. Tiny amounts of a catalyst
often suffice to bring about such a transformative effect. Such a
"catalytic" nuclear attack between nuclear weapons states was a serious
policy concern in the nineteen-fifties in the United States where
strategists were seized of the notion that a "small" nuclear weapons
state (for which read "China") could start a nuclear war between the
United States and the former Soviet Union (FSU). As articulated by the
ubiquitous Herman Kahn, the concern was that the small "catalytic" state
instigating the conflict would be the least damaged at the end of a
nuclear war, and could increase its relative power by starting a war
between other nuclear armed states that resulted in their catastrophic
destruction. In his classic essay outlining this argument, Donald Kobe
derived what he termed to be suspicion, retaliation, destruction,
catalytic war utility, and casualty matrices for each country that
defined outcomes for each state in a "catalytic nuclear war."\[2\] As
China began to test its own nuclear weapons and the United States and
the FSU began to anticipate its deployment in the sixties, the ability
of the two nuclear superpowers, even at this relatively early stage in
their rapidly growing nuclear forces, to overwhelmingly retaliate and
damage the catalytic state soon allayed this concern. Nonetheless, the
concept motivated these two nuclear armed states to strive for nuclear
non-proliferation, in part driven by their mutual fear of
state-sponsored nuclear terrorism should nuclear weapons and nuclear
weapons technology and materials become freely available---a concern
that persisted over the subsequent decades.\[3\] Is catalytic nuclear
terrorism still a serious policy concern? Today, the notion of
"catalytic" nuclear war seems archaic in certain respects, and reflected
a dismissive view at the time in the United States of the rationality of
a state leadership armed with nuclear weapons and facing an overwhelming
external adversary---in the case of China, not just one, but soon to be
two external nuclear enemies that targeted its cities and nuclear
forces. As China's minimum deterrent posture evolved, and as its nuclear
threat rhetoric subsided with the end of the Cultural Revolution, so the
fear of catalytic nuclear war also receded. However, the fear of a
catalytic nuclear war returned with a vengeance at the end of the Cold
War when multiple states found themselves nuclear-armed almost overnight
due to the collapse of the former Soviet Union, or proliferated
independent nuclear forces in rapid succession in South Asia and in slow
motion, North Korea. In the United States and Russia, formal and
informal discussion of the importance of avoiding war and nuclear war
due to third party nuclear attack, by state or non-state actors, took
place in diplomatic, military, and private channels, driven in part by
the risk of nuclear "mega-terrorism" as the efforts of various
insurgencies and global terrorist networks to acquire and use nuclear
weapons came to light. [The continued salience of the concept of
catalytic nuclear war rests on three nested arguments]{.underline}. The
[first]{.underline} is that [inadvertent nuclear war is
possible]{.underline}, that is, the [**probability** is **greater than
zero** albeit unknowable. **Multiple "threshold" events**]{.underline}
that **[could trigger inadvertent nuclear war]{.underline}** are
conceivable. In some unknowable combination, such drivers contribute to
a probability greater than zero that nuclear war between states will
occur, variously estimated at 0.1-1 percent year by strategic
analysts---although there is no objective basis for such estimates,
simply subjective estimates buttressed by the perception that specific
near-nuclear wars punctuated the Cold War and post-Cold War decades, at
which time the probability was perceived to be much higher for months at
a time. The [second]{.underline} is that [of all the drivers of
inadvertent war, state-supported and non-state nuclear terrorism may be
the least "directly controllable" by nuclear weapons
states]{.underline}. Moreover, [such nuclear terrorist attacks may
coincide in the future with the influence of other drivers that could
trigger **rapid escalation** to nuclear first use in conditions of
complex nuclear confrontation]{.underline} involving two or more nuclear
weapons states. Thus, [the non-state terrorist driver of nuclear war may
**[render "normal"]{.mark} positive and negative [controls]{.mark} on
nuclear use [far less stabilizing]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} in [the
past]{.mark}]{.underline} when states were the sole concern in nuclear
confrontations, depending on how a terrorist nuclear attack might affect
the various contributing pathways to inadvertent nuclear war (listed in
the next section). The [third]{.underline} is that such [**nuclear
[terrorist attacks]{.mark}** [may]{.mark} take many forms]{.underline},
as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Types of Nuclear Terrorism from Least to
Most Damaging • Credible Threats of Nuclear Terrorism • Hostage Taking •
[Steal, Smuggle, Acquire Radioactive Material for **Dirty
Bomb**]{.underline} • [Steal, Smuggle, [Acquire]{.mark}]{.underline}

Fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline} • [Simultaneous **Cyber Attacks** Disable
**[Critical Infrastructure]{.mark}** Leading to Mass Casualties
[or]{.mark} to Enable Nuclear Terrorism]{.underline} • [[Acquire
**Nuclear Weapon**]{.underline}]{.mark}; Detonate Nuclear Weapon Notes
to Figure 1: a credible threat not accompanied by one or more actions to
realize the threat is the least damage act of terrorism, and rests on
the perception of those threatened as to the perpetrator's intention and
capability. [Many nuclear terrorism threats are made. Relatively few are
credible]{.underline}. The types below "mere" threats are characterized
by actions which may (or may not) have been preceded by credible
threats. "Footloose" here is shorthand for loss of control of legitimate
and authorized control entity, public or private, that is subject to
diversion and seizure by a non-state entity. Cyber attacks may be part
of the types of nuclear terrorism because a competent terrorist entity
will employ cyberattacks as part of a nuclear terrorist attack. However,
a cyber attack that disables critical infrastructure at the same time as
another type of direct nuclear terrorist attack is conducted would be
highly damaging and if it results of itself in mass casualties, may
enable and amplify the consequences of dirty bomb or an actual nuclear
detonation. In this sense, [a cyber attack may be a cyber-**multiplier**
for other types of nuclear terrorism]{.underline}. Of course, [a **cyber
attack** aimed at **mass casualties** and terrorist effects may be
undertaken **without any form of nuclear terrorism** associated with
it]{.underline}. Finally, acquisition of radioactive materials or
fissile material may occur via theft, purchase, or self-manufacture (the
least likely and most difficult of the three acquisition pathways). Some
may argue that radiological weapons (dirty bombs) are not nuclear at all
in that they do not involve criticality at all, just the radioactive
properties of the materials, and may be relatively crude and low
technology. However, some nuclear weapons aim to achieve precisely such
radiological effects on varying scales and long-term radiological
effects, rather than blast and other direct irradiation of targeted
humans. Dirty bombs and nuclear bombs exist on a spectrum and where
competent, malevolent, and motivated non-state actors might position
themselves on that spectrum remains an open question. \*\*\* These many
types of terrorist nuclear attack present states with starkly different
potential damage, greater possible ambiguity or even opacity in terms of
precursor indicators as well as identity of the perpetrator. [**Any** of
these types of attack may affect nuclear-armed states in
**unpredictable** ways with respect to their own nuclear use decisions
at times when inter-state conflict may be more or less
likely]{.underline}. These various types of attack by non-state actors
reduce into three basic categories of threat and use, as follows:
Credible threat of either nuclear detonation or radiological attack with
possible massive damages Actual or sub-critical nuclear detonation
Actual spent fuel or reactor attack with substantial radiological
release. In turn, such categories of terrorist attack might be realized
in or against one or more types of targeted state, viz, a nuclear armed
state, a nuclear umbrella state that receives nuclear extended
deterrence from a nuclear armed state, or a non-nuclear weapons state
which may or may not have nuclear fuel cycle facilities in and/or
fissile material stored on its territory. (Thus, the target may or may
not be a state, a state agency, or a state facility---it might be a
civilian target such as a company or a religious entity; but in this
paper, all terrorist nuclear attacks are assumed to take place only in
places controlled by functioning states). Nuclear terrorism post-cold
war: trigger for inadvertent nuclear war? [The possible catalytic effect
of nuclear terrorism on the risk of state-based nuclear war is not a
simple linkage. The multiple types and scales of nuclear terrorism may
affect state-nuclear use decisions along **multiple pathways** that lead
to **inadvertent nuclear war**. These include]{.underline}: [Early
warning systems fail or are "tripped" in ways that lead to
**launch-on-warning**]{.underline} Accidental nuclear detonation,
including sub-critical explosions. [Strategic **miscalc**ulation **in
crisis**]{.underline}, show of force [Decision-making failure (such as
irrational, misperception, bias, degraded, group, and time-compressed
decision-making) **Allied** or **enemy** choices (to seek revenge, to
**exploit nuclear risk**]{.underline}, to act out of desperation)
[Organizational cybernetics whereby a nuclear command-control-and
communications (**NC3**) system generates **error**]{.underline},
including the interplay of national NC3 systems in what may be termed
the meta-NC3 system. [Synchronous and coincident combinations of
above]{.underline}.\[4\] Exactly how, where, and when nuclear terrorism
may "ambush" nuclear armed states already heading for or on such a path
to inadvertent nuclear war depends on who is targeting whom at a given
time, either immediately due to high tension, or generally due to a
structural conflict between states. Nuclear armed states today form a
complex set of global threat relationships that are not distributed
uniformly across the face of Earth. Rather, based on sheer firepower and
reach, the nine nuclear weapons states form a global hierarchy with at
least four tiers, viz: Tier 1: United States, clear technological
supremacy and qualitative edge. Tier 2: Russia, China, global nuclear
powers and peers with the United States due to the unique destructive
power of even relatively small nuclear arsenals, combined with global
reach of missile and bomber delivery systems, thereby constituting a
two-tiered global "nuclear triangle" with the United States. Tier 3:
France, UK, NATO nuclear sharing and delivery NATO members (Belgium,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey) and the NATO and Pacific
nuclear umbrella states (Japan, South Korea, Australia) that depend on
American nuclear extended deterrence and directly and indirectly support
US and US-allied nuclear operations even though they do not host nor
deliver nuclear weapons themselves. Tier 4: India, Pakistan, Israel,
DPRK. The first two tiers constitute the global nuclear threat triangle
that exists between the United States, Russia, and China, forming a
global nuclear "truel." Each of these states targets the others; each
represents an existential threat to the other; and each has a long
history of mutual nuclear threat that is now a core element of their
strategic identity. Tier three consists of states with their own nuclear
force but integrated with that of the United States (even France!) that
expand the zone of mutual nuclear threat over much of the northern and
even parts of the southern hemisphere; and states that host American
nuclear command, control, communications, and intelligence systems that
support US nuclear operations and to whom nuclear deterrence is
"extended" (if, for example, Australia's claim to having an American
nuclear umbrella is believed). The fourth tier is composed of smaller
nuclear forces with a primarily regional reach and focus. Between most
of these nuclear armed states and across the tiers, there are few shared
"rules of the road." The more of these states that are engaged in a
specific conflict and location, the more unpredictable and unstable this
global nuclear threat system becomes, with the potential for cascading
and concatenating effects. Indeed, as the number of nuclear states
projecting nuclear threat against each other increases, the notion of
strategic stability may lose all meaning. The emergence of a fifth
tier---of [**non-state actors** with the capacity to project nuclear
threat against nuclear-armed and nuclear umbrella states]{.underline}
(although not only these states)---[is a critically important possible
catalytic actor in the new conditions of nuclear threat complexity that
already exist today]{.underline}. Such a layer [represents an "edge of
chaos" where the attempts by nuclear armed states to exert absolute
"vertical" control over the use of nuclear weapons confront the
potential of non-state entities and even individuals (insiders) to
engage in "horizontal" nuclear terrorism]{.underline}, presenting
radically different control imperatives to the standard paradigm of
organizational procedures, technical measures, and safeguards of various
kinds. This tier is like the waves and tides on a beach that quickly
surrounds and then causes sand castles to collapse. In 2010, [Robert
Ayson reviewed the potential linkages between inter-state nuclear war
and non-state terrorism]{.underline}. He [concluded]{.underline}:
"...\[T\]hese two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor nuclear attack and
a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable. It is just possible that [some sort of terrorist attack, and
especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of
events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons]{.underline}
between two or more of the states that possess them."\[5\] How this
linkage might unfold is the subject of the next sections of this essay.
Are non-state actors motivated and able to attempt nuclear terrorism? A
diverse set of non-state actors have engaged in terrorist
activities---for which there is no simple or consensual definition. [In
2011, there were more than 6,900 known extremist, terrorist and other
organizations associated with guerrilla warfare, political
violence]{.underline}, protest, [**organized crime** and
cyber-crime]{.underline}. Of these, about 120 terrorist and extremist
groups had been blacklisted by the United Nations, the European Union
and six major countries.\[6\] [**Some have argued** that the
**technical**, **organizational**, and **funding** demanded for a
successful nuclear attack, especially involving nuclear weapons,
**exceeds** the **capacity** of most of the non-state actors with
terrorist proclivities. Unfortunately, this assertion is **not true**,
especially at lower levels of impact]{.underline} as shown in Figure 1;
[but even at the highest levels of obtaining authentic nuclear weapons
capabilities, a small number of **non-state actors already exhibit** the
**motivation** and possible **capacity** to become
nuclear-armed]{.underline}. Ellingsen suggests a useful distinction that
nuclear terrorists may be impelled by two divergent motivations, as
shown in Figure 2, creating "opportunistic" and "patient" profiles.\[7\]
The requirements for an opportunist non-state nuclear terrorist tend
towards immediate use and the search for short-term payoffs with only
tactical levels of commitment; whereas the patient non-state nuclear
terrorist is able and willing to sustain a long-term acquisition effort
to deal a strategic blow to an adversary in a manner that could be
achieved only with nuclear weapons. \[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\] In turn, many
factors will drive how a potential nuclear terrorist non-state
organization that obtains nuclear weapons or materials may seek to
employ them, especially in its nuclear command-and-control orientations.
Blair and Ackerman suggest that the goals, conditions, and capacity
limitations that shape a possible nuclear terrorist's posture lead
logically to three types of nuclear terrorist nuclear
command-and-control postures, viz: pre-determined (in which the
leadership sends a fire order to a nuclear-armed subordinate and no
change is entertained and no capacity to effect change is established in
the field, that is, the order is fire-and-forget); assertive (in which
only the central command can issue a nuclear fire order, central control
is maintained at all times, with resulting demanding communications
systems to support such control); and delegative (in which lower level
commanders control nuclear weapons and have pre-delegated authority to
use them in defined circumstances, for example, evidence of nuclear
explosions combined with loss-of-connectivity with their central
command).\[8\] An example of such delegative control system was the
November 26, 2008 attack on Mumbai that used social media reporting to
enable the attacking terrorists to respond to distant controller
direction and to adapt to counter-terrorist attacks---a connectivity
tactic that the authorities were too slow to shut down before mayhem was
achieved.\[9\] Logically, one might expect nuclear terrorists oriented
toward short-term, tactical goals to employ pre-determined nuclear
command-and-control strategies in the hope that the speed of attack and
minimum field communications avoids discovery and interdiction before
the attack is complete; whereas nuclear terrorists oriented toward
long-term, strategic goals might employ more pre-delegative
command-and-control systems that would support a bargaining use and
therefore a field capacity to deploy nuclear weapons or materials that
can calibrate actual attack based on communications with the central
leadership with the risk of interdiction through surveillance and
counter-attack. These differing strategic motivations, timelines, and
strategies in many respects invert those of nuclear weapons states that
rely on large organizations, procedures, and technical controls, to
ensure that nuclear weapons are never used without legitimate
authorization; and if they are used, to minimize needless civilian
casualties (at least some nuclear armed states aspire to this outcome).
The repertoire of state-based practices that presents other states with
credible nuclear threat and reassures them that nuclear weapons are
secure and controlled is likely to be completely mismatched with the
strengths and strategies of non-state nuclear terrorists that may seek
to maximize civilian terror, are not always concerned about their own
survival or even that of their families and communities-of-origin, and
may be willing to take extraordinary risk combined with creativity to
exploit the opportunities for attack presented by nuclear weapons,
umbrella, and non-nuclear states, or their private adversaries. For
non-state actors to succeed at complex engineering project such as
acquiring a nuclear weapons or nuclear threat capacity demands
substantial effort. Gary Ackerman specifies that to have a chance of
succeeding, non-state actors with nuclear weapons aspirations must be
able to demonstrate that they control substantial resources, have a safe
haven in which to conduct research and development, have their own or
procured expertise, are able to learn from failing and have the stamina
and strategic commitment to do so, and manifest long-term planning and
ability to make rational choices on decadal timelines. He identified
five such violent non-state actors who already conducted such
engineering projects (see Figure 3), and also noted the important
facilitating condition of a global network of expertize and hardware.
Thus, although the skill, financial, and materiel requirements of a
non-state nuclear weapons project present a high bar, they are certainly
reachable. \[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\] Along similar lines, James Forest
examined the extent to which non-state actors can pose a threat of
nuclear terrorism.\[10\] He notes that such entities face practical
constraints, including expense, the obstacles to stealing many essential
elements for nuclear weapons, the risk of discovery, and the
difficulties of constructing and concealing such weapons. He also
recognizes the strategic constraints that work against obtaining nuclear
weapons, including a cost-benefit analysis, possible de-legitimation
that might follow from perceived genocidal intent or use, and the
primacy of political-ideological objectives over long-term projects that
might lead to the group's elimination, the availability of cheaper and
more effective alternatives that would be foregone by pursuit of nuclear
weapons, and the risk of failure and/or discovery before successful
acquisition and use occurs. In the past, almost all---but not
all---non-state terrorist groups appeared to be restrained by a
combination of high practical and strategic constraints, plus their own
cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of pursuing nuclear
weapons. However, should some or all of these constraints diminish, a
rapid non-state nuclear proliferation is possible. [Although only a few
non-state actors such as **Al Qaeda** and **Islamic State** have
exhibited such underlying stamina and organizational capacities and
**actually attempted to obtain nuclear weapons-related skills, hardware,
and materials**, the past is not prologue]{.underline}. [An incredibly
diverse set of variously **motivated** terrorist groups exist already,
including politico-ideological, apocalyptic-millenarian,
politico-religious, nationalist-separatist, ecological, and
political-insurgency entities, some of which converge with
**criminal-military** and **criminal-scientist** (profit based)
networks; but also pyscho-pathological mass killing cults, lone wolves,
and ephemeral copy-cat non-state actors. The social, economic, and
deculturating conditions that generate such entities are likely to
persist and even expand]{.underline}. In particular, rapidly growing
coastal mega-cities as part of rapid global urbanization offer such
actors the ability to sustain themselves as "flow gatekeepers," possibly
[in alliance with **global criminal networks**, thereby supplanting the
highland origins of many of today's non-state violent actors with global
reach]{.underline}.\[11\] [Other contributing factors contributing to
the supply of possible non-state actors seeking nuclear weapons include
new entries such as city states in search of new security strategies,
megacities creating their own transnationally active security forces,
non-states with partial or complete territorial control such as Taiwan
and various micro-states, failing states, provinces in dissociating,
failing states that fall victim to internal chaos and the displacement
effects of untrammeled globalization, and altogether failed states
resulting in ungoverned spaces. To this must be added domestic terrorist
entities in the advanced industrial states]{.underline} as they hollow
out their economies due to economic globalization and restructuring,
adjust to cross-border migration, and adapt to cultural and political
dislocation. In short, the prognosis is for the fifth tier of non-state
actors to beset the other four tiers with intense turbulence just as
waves on a beach swirl around sandcastles, washing away their
foundations, causing grains of sand to cascade, and eventually
collapsing the whole structure. Observed non-state nuclear threats and
attacks [In light of the constraints faced by non-state terrorist actors
in past decades, it is not surprising that the constellation of actual
nuclear terrorist attacks and threats has been relatively
limited]{.underline} during and since the end of the Cold War. As Martha
Crenshaw noted in a comment on the draft of this paper: We still don't
know why terrorists (in the sense of non-state actors) have not moved
into the CBRN \[chemical,biological, radiological or nuclear \] domain.
(Many people think biosecurity is more critical, for that matter.) Such
a move would be extremely risky for the terrorist actor, even if the
group possessed both capability (resources, secure space, time,
patience) and motivation (willingness to expend the effort, considering
opportunity costs). So far it appears that "conventional" terrorism
serves their purposes well enough. Most of what we have seen is
rhetoric, with some scattered and not always energetic
initiatives.\[12\] [Nonetheless, those that **have occurred**
demonstrate unambiguously that such threats and attacks are **not merely
hypothetical**, in spite of the limiting conditions outlined
above]{.underline}. [One survey [documented **eighty**]{.mark} **actual,
[planned attacks]{.mark}** on nuclear facilities containing nuclear
materials between 1961-2016]{.underline}\[13\] as follows: 80 attacks in
3 waves (1970s armed assaults, 1990s thefts, post-2010, breaches) High
threat attacks: 32/80 attacks posed substantial, verified threat of
which 44 percent involved insiders. [All types of targets were found in
the data set---on reactors, other nuclear facilities, military
bases]{.underline} leading Gary Ackerman and to conclude: "[Overall,
**empirical evidence** suggests that there are sufficient cases in each
of the listed categories that no type of threat can be
ignored]{.underline}."\[14\] [No region was immune; no year was without
such a threat or attack]{.underline}. Thus, [there is a likely to be a
coincidence of future non-state threats and attacks with inter-state
nuclear-prone conflicts, as in the past, and possibly more so given the
current trend in and the generative conditions for global terrorist
activity that will likely pertain in the coming decades]{.underline}. Of
these attacks, about a quarter each were ethno-nationalist, secular
utopian, or unknown in motivation; and the remaining quarter were a
motley mix of religious (11 percent), "other" (5 percent),
personal-idiosyncratic (4 percent), single issue (2 percent) and state
sponsored (1 percent) in motivation. [The conclusion is unavoidable
that]{.underline} there [a non-state nuclear terrorist
attack]{.underline} in the Northeast Asia region [is
possible]{.underline}. The following sections outline the possible
situations in which nuclear terrorist attacks might be implicated as a
trigger to interstate conflict, and even nuclear war. Particular
attention is paid to the how [nuclear command, control and
communications systems may play an independent and unanticipated role in
leading to inadvertent nuclear war, separate to the contributors to
inadvertency normally included such as degradation of decision-making
due to time and other pressures; accident; "wetware" (human failures),
software or hardware failures; and misinterpretation of intended or
unintended signals from an adversary]{.underline}. Regional pathways to
interstate nuclear war [At least five distinct nuclear-prone axes of
conflict are evident in]{.underline} Northeast Asia. These are:
[**US-DPRK** conflict]{.underline} (including with United States, US
allies Japan, South Korea and Australia; and all other UNC command
allies. Many permutations possible ranging from non-violent collapse to
implosion and civil war, inter-Korean war, slow humanitarian crisis. Of
these implosion-civil war in the DPRK may be the most dangerous,
followed closely by an altercation at the Joint Security Area at
Panmunjon where US, ROK, and DPRK soldiers interact constantly.
[**China-Taiwan** conflict]{.underline}, whereby China may use nuclear
weapons to overcome US forces operating in the West Pacific, either at
sea, or based on US (Guam, Alaska) or US allied territory in the ROK,
Japan, the Philippines, or Australia); or US uses nuclear weapons in
response to Chinese attack on Taiwan. [**China-Japan**
conflict]{.underline} escalates via attacks on early warning systems,
for example, underwater hydrophone systems (Ayson-Ball, 2011).
[**China-Russia** conflict]{.underline}, possibly in context of
loss-of-control of Chinese nuclear forces in a regional conflict
involving Taiwan or North Korea. [**Russia-US** conflict]{.underline},
involving horizontal escalation from a head-on collision with Russian
nuclear forces in Europe or the Middle East; or somehow starts at sea
(mostly likely seems ASW) or over North Korea (some have cited risk of
US missile defenses against North Korean attack as risking Russian
immediate response). [Combinations of or simultaneous eruption of the
above conflicts that culminate in nuclear war are also
possible]{.underline}. Other unanticipated nuclear-prone conflict axes
(such as Russia-Japan) could also emerge with little warning.
[Precursors of such nuclear-laden conflicts]{.underline} in this region
[also exist that could lead states to the brink of nuclear
war]{.underline} and demonstrate that nuclear war is all too possible
between states in this region. Examples include the August 1958
Quemoy-Matsu crisis, in which the United States deployed nuclear weapons
to Taiwan, and the US Air Force has only a nuclear defense strategy in
place to defend Taiwan should China have escalated its shelling campaign
to an actual attack; the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when a US
nuclear armed missile was nearly fired from Okinawa due to a false fire
order; the March 1969 Chinese-Soviet military clash and resulting
consideration of nuclear attacks by both sides; and the August 1976
poplar tree crisis at Panmunjon in Korea, when the United States moved
nuclear weapons back to the DMZ and the White House issued pre-delegated
orders to the US commander in Korea to attack North Korea if the tree
cutting task force was attacked by North Korean forces. Loss-of-control
of Nuclear Weapons As is well known, nuclear armed states must
routinely---and in the midst of a crisis---ensure that their nuclear
weapons are never used without legitimate authority, but also ensure at
the same time that they are always available for immediate use with
legitimate authority. This "always-never" paradox is managed in part by
a set of negative and positive controls, reliant upon procedural and
technical measures, to maintain legitimate state-based
command-and-control (see Figure Four). \[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\] In this
framework, Jerry Conley has produced a taxonomy of nuclear
command-and-control structures that embody varying notional national
"command-and-control" orientations (also referred to as stability points
or biases). Each nuclear armed state exhibits a distinct preference for
technical and procedural measures to achieve negative and positive
control of nuclear weapons. The way that a state constructs its control
system varies depending on its size, wealth, technology, leadership, and
strategic orientation, lending each state a unique use propensity
affected by the information processing and transmission functions of the
nuclear command-and-control system, that in part determines the use or
non-use decisions made by the leaders of nuclear armed states. The
resulting ideal nuclear command-and-control state structures are shown
in Table 1. \[TABLE 1 OMITTED\] These ideal types are summarized with
respect to the defining axes of control measure in Figure Five. \[FIGURE
5 OMITTED\] In Northeast Asia, a four-way nuclear threat system exists
that has a three world-class nuclear armed states, the United States,
Russia and China, interacting with a fourth tier, barely nuclear armed
state, the DPRK. In this quadrilateral nuclear standoff, the DPRK's
simple NC3 system likely is an amalgam of a poorly resourced,
militarized, and personalized leadership---which may lead it to
oscillate between procedural and technical measures as the basis of
control, with a primary emphasis on positive use control, not negative
control to avoid unauthorized use. China's large, centralized NC3 system
co-mingles nuclear and conventional communications between national
commanders and deployed nuclear forces and may emphasize negative more
than positive use controls to ensure Party control. Russia's highly
centralized, complex NC3 system relies on legacy technology and limited
economic base for modernization. It too may be more oriented towards
negative controls in peacetime, but have the capacity to spring almost
instantly to primary reliance on positive controls in times of crisis or
tension. The US NC3 system is large, complex and based on wealth and
technological prowess. It is under civilian, not military control, at
least in principle and in peacetime, and is redundant, diverse, and
relatively resilient. Non-state nuclear attack as trigger of inter-state
nuclear war in Northeast Asia The critical issue is how [a nuclear
terrorist attack may "catalyze" inter-state nuclear war, especially the
NC3 systems that inform and partly determine how leaders respond to
nuclear threat]{.underline}. Current conditions in Northeast Asia
suggest that [multiple precursory conditions for nuclear terrorism
already exist or exist in nascent form]{.underline}. In Japan, for
example, low-level, individual, terroristic violence with nuclear
materials, against nuclear facilities, is real. [In **all
countries**]{.underline} of the region, [the **risk of diversion of
nuclear material is real**, although the risk is likely higher due to
volume and laxity of security in some countries]{.underline} of the
region [than in others]{.underline}. [In all countries, the risk of an
**insider "sleeper" threat is real** in security and nuclear agencies,
and such insiders **already operated in actual terrorist
organizations**]{.underline}. [Insider corruption is also observable in
nuclear fuel cycle agencies in all countries]{.underline} of the region.
The threat of extortion to induce insider cooperation is also real in
all countries. [The possibility of a **cult attempting to build and buy
nuclear weapons is real** and has already occurred]{.underline} in the
region.\[15\] [**Cyber-terrorism against nuclear reactors is real and
such attacks have already taken place** in South Korea]{.underline}
(although it remains difficult to attribute the source of the attacks
with certainty). [The stand-off ballistic and drone threat to nuclear
weapons and fuel cycle facilities is real in the region, including from
non-state actors, some of whom have already adopted and used such
technology almost instantly from when it becomes accessible]{.underline}
(for example, drones).\[16\] Two other broad risk factors are also
present in the region. The [social and political conditions for
**extreme ethnic and xenophobic nationalism are emerging**]{.underline}
in China, Korea, Japan, and Russia. Although there has been no risk of
attack on or loss of control over nuclear weapons since their removal
from Japan in 1972 and from South Korea in 1991, this risk continues to
exist in North Korea, China, and Russia, and to the extent that they are
deployed on aircraft and ships of these and other nuclear weapons states
(including submarines) deployed in the region's high seas, also outside
their territorial borders. [The most conducive circumstance for
catalysis to occur due to a nuclear terrorist attack might involve the
following nexi of timing and conditions]{.underline}: [Low-level,
tactical, or random individual terrorist attacks for whatever reasons,
even assassination of national leaders, up to and including dirty
radiological bomb attacks, that overlap with inter-state crisis dynamics
in ways that affect state decisions to threaten with or to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. This might be undertaken by an opportunist nuclear
terrorist entity in search of rapid and high political impact. Attacks
on major national or international events in each country to maximize
terror and to de-legitimate national leaders and whole governments. In
Japan, for example, more than ten heads of state and senior ministerial
international meetings are held each year. For the strategic nuclear
terrorist, patiently acquiring higher level nuclear threat capabilities
for such attacks and then staging them to maximum effect could accrue
strategic gains. Attacks or threatened attacks, including deception and
disguised attacks, will have maximum leverage when nuclear-armed states
are near or on the brink of war or during a national crisis (such as
Fukushima), when intelligence agencies, national leaders, facility
operators, surveillance and policing agencies, and first responders are
already maximally committed and over-extended. At this point, we note an
important caveat to the original concept of catalytic nuclear war as it
might pertain to nuclear terrorist threats or attacks. Although an
attack might be disguised so that it is attributed to a nuclear-armed
state, or a ruse might be undertaken to threaten such attacks by
deception, in reality a catalytic strike by a nuclear weapons state in
conditions of mutual vulnerability to nuclear retaliation for such a
strike from other nuclear armed states would be highly irrational.
[Accordingly, the effect of nuclear terrorism involving a nuclear
detonation or major radiological release may not of itself be catalytic
of nuclear war---at least not intentionally]{.underline}--because it
will not lead directly to the destruction of a targeted nuclear-armed
state. [Rather, it may be catalytic of non-nuclear war between
states]{.underline}, especially if the non-state actor turns out to be
aligned with or sponsored by a state (in many Japanese minds, the
natural candidate for the perpetrator of such an attack is the pro-North
Korean General Association of Korean Residents, often called Chosen
Soren, which represents many of the otherwise stateless Koreans who were
born and live in Japan) and a further sequence of coincident events is
necessary to drive escalation to the point of nuclear first use by a
state. Also, the catalyst---the non-state actor--is almost assured of
discovery and destruction either during the attack itself (if it takes
the form of a nuclear suicide attack then self-immolation is assured) or
as a result of a search-and-destroy campaign from the targeted state
(unless the targeted government is annihilated by the initial terrorist
nuclear attack). It follows [that the effects of a non-state nuclear
attack may be characterized better as a [trigger]{.mark} effect,
bringing about [a **cascade** of]{.mark} nuclear use decisions within
NC3 systems that shift each state increasingly away from nuclear non-use
and increasingly towards nuclear use by releasing negative controls and
enhancing positive controls in **multiple [action-reaction escalation
spirals]{.mark}**]{.underline} (depending on how many nuclear armed
states are party to an inter-state conflict that is already underway at
the time of the non-state nuclear attack); [and/or by inducing
concatenating nuclear attacks across geographically proximate nuclear
weapons forces of states already caught in the crossfire of nuclear
threat or attacks of their own making before a nuclear terrorist
attack]{.underline}.\[17\] [An example of a cascading effect would be a
non-state attack on a key node of linked early warning systems that is
unique to and critical for strategic nuclear forces to be employable, or
the effect of multiple, coincident and erroneous sensor alerts of
incoming attacks]{.underline} (as occurred during the Cuban Missile
Crisis with radar in Florida monitoring Soviet missiles in Cuba that
mistakenly fused an erroneous reading of a missile trajectory with a
real observation of a Soviet satellite that happened to be passing
overhead). [An example of a concatenating effect would an attack that
leads a nuclear weapons state to target two other states forces because
it **cannot determine whose forces attacked** its own]{.underline}. This
circumstance might arise if key anti-submarine forces or an aircraft
carrier battle group were attacked and it was impossible to determine in
a given waterway or area of ocean whose submarines were present or
responsible for the attack, leading the attacked state to destroy all
the submarines presenting on-going threat to its strategic forces. As we
noted above, a terrorist nuclear shock may take various forms and appear
in different places. Ever since an extortion attempt in Boston in 1974
based on the threat of nuclear detonation, the threat of an improvised
nuclear device has been credible. For such a threat to be credible, a
non-state terrorist entity must release a plausible precursor such as
nuclear material or warhead design information, or stage an actual
demonstration attack that makes it plausible that the attacker controls
a significant quantity of fissile material (most likely plutonium, or
simply radioactive materials suitable for a radiological device that
might be used to draw in first responders and then detonate a warhead to
maximize damage and terror). Such an attack might be combined with a
separate attack on critical infrastructure such as a cyberattack. The
attacker might retain sufficient material for bargaining and insurance
should the initial attack fail. Given the need to adapt to
circumstances, such an attacker is likely to be patient and strategic,
in the terms defined earlier, and to have extensive organizational and
communication capacities; and to be able to operate at multiple targeted
sites, possibly in multiple countries. Given its patience and stamina,
such an attacker would select a highly symbolic target such as a high
level meeting. Such a case would present the targeted state with an
exquisite dilemma: bargaining and negotiation with the non-state actor
threatening such an attack may be justified given the explicit and
plausible nature of the threat, which may be politically impossible
while making counter-terrorism operations very risky and only possible
with extreme caution. And, such an attacker might well issue a false
statement about state-sponsorship to invoke third parties in ways that
vastly complicate the response to the threat. If the attacker is less
capable and driven for immediate political or other returns, then it may
be satisfied with highly delegated delivery with no recall option, and
no use of communications to minimize the risk of discovery or
interdiction. Such an attacker is also less likely to wait for the
circumstances in which inter-state nuclear war is more likely due to
inter-state tension; and also less likely to seek third party effects
beyond the damage to the immediate target and resulting terror. Should
surveillance indicate that an improvised nuclear device is in motion,
then an all-out search to interdict the attackers and to retrieve the
device or materials would likely ensue. In these two instances of
credible threat of non-state nuclear attack, the insider versus outsider
perpetrator factor will affect significantly how the attack affects
possible inter-state conflicts. In Kobe's terms, if the perpetrator is
confirmed to be an outsider, then a country-of-origin suspicion matrix
may cast suspicion onto another state as possible sponsor. For an attack
threatened in China, the linkage might be back to Russia, the United
States, or North Korea. For an attack threatened in Russia, the linkage
might be back to the United States, China, or North Korea. For an attack
threatened in North Korea, the linkage might be back to the United
States, China, or Russia. And for an attack threatened in one of the
umbrella states in the region, South Korea and Japan, such an attack
might be linked to each other, as well as to China, North Korea, or
Russia. In each case, the shadow of suspicion and possible accusations
could tilt decision-making processes in one or more of these states and
ways that could worsen pre-existing views about the nuclear use
propensity of an opposing nuclear armed state. Should an actual nuclear
attack occur, the situation is even more complex and problematic. Such
an attack might be purely accidental, due to hardware, software, or
human error while nuclear materials or weapons are in transit. In
principle, this limits the site of such an event to the nuclear weapons
states or their ships and aircraft as neither South Korea nor Japan host
nuclear weapons today. If an insider is involved, then the perpetrator
may be identified quickly, and whether there is a linkage with another
state may become evident (depending on nuclear forensics as well as
insight obtained from surviving attackers). If an outsider is the
perpetrator, then the suspicion matrix will come into play again, with
possibly severe effects on inter-state tension due to accusation,
suspicion, and fear of follow-on attacks. During the attack, especially
if it is a hostage-taking type of attack, the identity of the
perpetrator may be unknown or ambiguous, and maintaining this ambiguity
or even opacity as to the attacker may be deliberate---as was the case
with the 2008 Mumbai attack in which the controller tried to ensure that
all the attackers were killed in the course of the twelve separate but
coordinated attacks across the city over four days. [Although much
progress has been made in]{.underline} establishing local **[nuclear
forensics]{.underline}** capability in Japan,\[18\] China, and South
Korea, [there is **no certainty** that it is sufficiently developed to
identify the perpetrator of an act of nuclear terrorism, especially if
there is a state sponsor and deception involved]{.underline}. Conclusion
We now move to our conclusion. Nuclear-armed states can place themselves
on the edge of nuclear war by a combination of threatening force
deployments and threat rhetoric. Statements by US and North Korea's
leaders and supporting amplification by state and private media to
present just such a lethal combination. Many observers have observed
that the risk of war and nuclear war, in Korea and globally, have
increased in the last few years---although no-one can say with authority
by how much and exactly for what reasons. However, states are restrained
in their actual decisions to escalate to conflict and/or nuclear war by
conventional deterrence, vital national interests, and other
institutional and political restraints, both domestic and international.
It is not easy, in the real world, or even in fiction, to start nuclear
wars.\[19\] Rhetorical threats are standard fare in realist and
constructivist accounts of inter-state nuclear deterrence, compellence,
and reassurance, and are not cause for alarm per se. States will manage
the risk in each of the threat relationships with other nuclear armed
states to stay back from the brink, let alone go over it, as they have
in the past. This argument was powerful and to many, persuasive during
the Cold War although it does not deny the hair-raising risks taken by
nuclear armed states during this period. Today, the multi-polarity of
nine nuclear weapons states interacting in a four-tiered nuclear threat
system means that the practice of sustaining nuclear threat and
preparing for nuclear war is no longer merely complicated, but is now
enormously complex in ways that may exceed the capacity of some and
perhaps all states to manage, even without the emergence of a fifth tier
of non-state actors to add further unpredictability to how this system
works in practice. The possibility that non-state actors may attack
without advance warning as to the time, place, and angle of attack
presents another layer of uncertainty to this complexity as to how
inter-state nuclear war may break out. That is, non-state actors with
nuclear weapons or threat goals and capacities do not seek the same
goals, will not use the same control systems, and will use radically
different organizational procedures and systems to deliver on their
threats compared with nuclear armed states. If used tactically for
immediate terrorist effect, a non-state nuclear terrorist could
violently attack nuclear facilities, exploiting any number of
vulnerabilities in fuel cycle facility security, or use actual nuclear
materials and even warheads against military or civilian targets. If a
persistent, strategically oriented nuclear terrorist succeed in gaining
credible nuclear threat capacities, it might take hostage one or more
states or cities. [If such an event coincides with already high levels
of tension and even military collisions between the non-nuclear forces
of nuclear armed states, then a non-state nuclear terrorist attack could
impel a nuclear armed state to escalate its threat or even military
actions against other states, in the belief that this targeted state may
have sponsored the non-state attack, or was simply the source of the
attack, whatever the declared identity of the attacking non-state
entity. This outcome could trigger these states to go onto one or more
of the pathways to inadvertent nuclear war, especially if the terrorist
attack was on a high value and high risk nuclear facility or involved
the seizure and/or use of fissile material. **[Some]{.mark} experts
[dismiss]{.mark} this possibility** as so remote as to be not worth
worrying about. **[Yet]{.mark} the [history]{.mark} of nuclear terrorism
globally**]{.underline} and in the Northeast Asian region
**[[suggests]{.mark} otherwise]{.underline}**. Using the sand castle
metaphor, once built on the high tide line, sand castles may withstand
the wind but eventually succumb to the tide once it reaches the
castle---at least once, usually twice a day. Also, [**theories of
organizational and technological failure** point to the **coincidence of
[multiple]{.mark}, relatively [insignificant]{.mark} driving
[events]{.mark}** that interact or **[accumulate]{.mark}** in ways that
lead the "metasystem" to fail, **[even if each]{.mark} individual
[component]{.mark} of a system [works perfectly]{.mark}**. Thus, the
potential **catalytic effect** of a nuclear terrorist incident is **not
that it would of itself lead to a sudden inter-state nuclear war**; but
that [at a time of **crisis**]{.mark} when **alert levels** are
**already high**, when control systems on nuclear forces have already
shifted from primary emphasis on negative to positive control, when
[**decision making** is **already stressed**]{.mark}, when the
[potential for **miscalc**]{.mark}ulation [is]{.mark} already
**[high]{.mark}** due to shows of force indicating that first-use is
nigh, when **rhetorical threats** promising annihilation on the one
hand, or collapse of **morale** and weakness on the other invite
counter-vailing threats by nuclear adversaries or their allies to gain
the upper hand in the "contest of resolve," and when **organizational
cybernetics** may be in play such that purposeful actions are
implemented differently than intended, then a terrorist nuclear attack
may shift a coincident combination of some or all of these factors to a
threshold level where they [**collectively** lead to a **first-use
decision**]{.mark} by one or more nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. [If
the terrorist attack is timed or happens to **coincide with high levels
of inter-state tension** involving nuclear-armed states, then some or
**all of these tendencies will likely be in play** anyway---**precisely
the concern** of those who posit pathways [to **inadvertent nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline} as outlined in section 2 above. The critical
question is, just as a catalyst breaks some bonds and lets other bonds
form, reducing the energy cost and time taken to achieve a chemical
reaction, how would a nuclear terrorist attack at time of nuclear
charged inter-state tension potentially shift the way that nuclear
threat is projected and perceived in a four or five-way nuclear-prone
conflict, and how might it affect the potential pathways to inadvertent
nuclear war in such a system? Such a pervasive incremental effect is
shown in Figure 6 below. \[FIGURE 6 OMITTED\] [Any one or indeed all of
these]{.underline} starting nuclear control profiles [may be
disputed]{.underline}, as might the control profile at the end of the
response arrow. (In Figure 6, each nuclear state responds to a terrorist
nuclear attack by loosening or abandoning negative controls against
unauthorized use, and shifts towards reliance mostly on positive
procedural controls biased towards use). [But]{.underline} each nuclear
armed state will make its moves in response to the posited terrorist
nuclear attack partly in response to its expectations as to how other
nuclear armed states will perceive and respond to these moves, as well
as their perception that an enemy state may have sponsored a terrorist
nuclear attack---and [considered together]{.underline}, it is obvious
that they may not share a common image of the other states' motivations
and actions in this response[, leading to cumulative potential for
misinterpretation and rapid subsequent action, reaction, and
escalation]{.underline}. It is also conceivable---although intuitively
it would seem [**far less likely**--that a terrorist nuclear attack at
such a conjuncture of partly or fully mobilized nuclear armed states
might induce one or more of them **to stand down**]{.underline}, slow
down its decision making or deployments, establish new communication
channels with potential nuclear enemy states, and even make common cause
to hunt down and eliminate the non-state nuclear terrorist entity, or
coordinate operations to respond to the threat of a second terrorist
nuclear attack---the credibility of which would be high in the aftermath
of a successful initial non-state nuclear attack. As Robert Ayson
concluded: In considering the ways in which a terrorist nuclear attack
could (wittingly or unwittingly) spark off a wider nuclear exchange
government leaders are entitled to be just as worried about their own
actions---how they would respond to a terrorist nuclear attack and how
that response might get very catastrophically out of control---as about
the terrorist act per se. If so, states need to do more than consider
the best ways to prevent terrorists from acquiring, deploying and then
detonating a nuclear weapon. They also need to think about how they can
control themselves in the event of a nuclear terrorist attack (even if
some might suggest this risks handing the terrorist a premature and
unnecessary victory by giving them indirect influence over the choices
states make).\[20\]

Overview

[Protecting]{.underline} Americans [from **terrorist attacks** within
the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [depends, to a
great extent, on U.S. **success overseas**]{.underline}. The task is
vast and worldwide. [It requires enlisting host country police to track
and capture terrorists, uncovering terrorist financing, sharing
intelligence with foreign partners, strengthening border surveillance in
remote and unpopulated regions and building partnerships with foreign
militaries]{.underline}. In the longer run, it requires convincing
entire societies to reject terrorist propaganda and recruitment. A
successful counterterrorism policy depends on strong relationships with
foreign governments and the people residing in countries on every
continent.

[**Embassies** are on the **frontline** in the overseas campaign against
terror and demands on ambassadors, staffs, and physical facilities have
increased exponentially]{.underline}. Since September 11, 2001,
embassies have hosted a continuing influx of inter-agency personnel
tasked with the full range of counterterrorism activities.

Under the direction of Chairman Richard G. Lugar, Senate Foreign
Relations Committee majority staff visited selected embassies in Africa,
Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East, as well as the headquarters of
four combatant commands, to focus specifically on the civilian/military
nexus. He asked staff to assess whether the State and Defense
Departments are working together overseas in a way that contributes to
overarching U.S. foreign policy goals in the individual countries and in
the regions.

FINDINGS

1\. [The number of military personnel and **Defense Department**
activities in non-combat countries is **increasing significantly**.
[Left unclear, **blurred lines of authority** between]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department [and]{.mark} the **[Defense]{.mark}**
Department]{.underline} could [[lead to]{.mark} **interagency [turf
wars]{.mark}** [that **undermine**]{.mark} the effectiveness of [the
**overall**]{.mark} **U.S. [effort]{.mark} against terrorism**. It is in
the embassies]{.underline} rather than in Washington [where interagency
differences on strategies, tactics and divisions of labor are
increasingly adjudicated]{.underline}.

2\. While finding, capturing, and eliminating individual terrorists and
their support networks is an imperative in the war against terror, [it
is repairing and building alliances, pursuing resolutions to regional
conflicts, [fostering **democracy**]{.mark} and development, and
defusing religious extremism worldwide that will overcome the terrorist
threat]{.underline} in the long-term. It has traditionally been the
military\'s mission to take direct action against U.S. adversaries while
the civilian agencies\' mission has been to pursue non-coercive measures
through diplomacy, international information programming, and foreign
and economic assistance. [As a result of inadequate funding for civilian
programs, however, U.S. **[defense]{.mark} agencies** are
[increasingly]{.mark} being **[granted authority]{.mark} and funding [to
fill]{.mark} perceived [gaps]{.mark}**. Such [**bleeding** of]{.mark}
civilian [responsibilities]{.mark} overseas [**from civilian to military
agencies** risks **weakening**]{.mark} the Secretary of [**State\'s
primacy** in **setting the agenda**]{.mark} for U.S. relations with
foreign countries and the Secretary of Defense\'s focus on war
fighting]{.underline}.

3\. [The increases of funding streams, self-assigned missions, and
realigned authorities for the Secretary of Defense and the combatant
commanders are **[placing new stresses on]{.mark} inter-agency
[coordination in the field]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Currently,
overlapping missions and inter-agency frictions are, for the most part,
refereed by the U.S. ambassador and other State Department leadership in
the embassy with intermittent referral to headquarters for guidance.
But, [**[as the role of the military expands]{.mark}**, particularly
[in]{.mark} the area of **[foreign assistance]{.mark}**, embassy
officials]{.underline} in some countries [question whether the
Department of **Defense [will]{.mark} chafe under the constraints of
State Department leadership** and **[work for still more
authority]{.mark} and funding**]{.underline}.

4\. [There is **evidence** that some [**host countries** are]{.mark}
**questioning the increasingly military component** of America\'s
profile overseas]{.underline}. Some foreign officials question what
appears to them as a new emphasis by the United States on military
approaches to problems that are not seen as lending themselves to
military solutions. Host country militaries clearly welcome increased
professional contact and interaction with the U.S. military. However,
some [host countries have elements in both government and general
society who are **[highly suspicious]{.mark}** of potential American
coercion]{.underline}. There is no sense so far that foreign hosts
believe the U.S. military is dominating U.S. policy in-country, but
[**if [such a perception]{.mark} were to gain hold**, it would **[give
ammunition to]{.mark} U.S. [adversaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. More
importantly, [it would **[weaken]{.mark}** the **bilateral
[relationships]{.mark}** that are **necessary to win the war against
terror**]{.underline}. Likewise, [**one** misstep or **poorly calculated
military** or other **operation** can significantly **set back the full
range of U.S. counterterrorism efforts** in an entire
region]{.underline}.

[[Security assistance in]{.mark} a **[tense]{.mark}** era of [**great
power competition** is **extremely sensitive** and can **increase
tension**]{.mark} and lead to **miscalculation**]{.underline}. The risk
in today's geopolitical environment is that providing sensitive and
potentially [[**provocative** assistance]{.mark} will not receive the
same scrutiny from policymakers and will become [the **norm**
for]{.mark}]{.underline} the administering agency, [the
**[DOD]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} the last era of great
power competition, [the Cold War, security assistance **[often stoked
tension]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the United States and the Soviet
Union [[and led to **spiraling commitments**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
instance, Soviet provision of nuclear missiles to Cuba led to a nuclear
standoff, while U.S. military support for Vietnam led to deepening U.S.
engagement.

[As competition [with **China** and **Russia**]{.mark} increases,
security assistance [could]{.mark} once again prove a **major source of
tension** and [cause **miscalc**]{.mark}**ulation**. Providing aid in
this environment is not a mere technical military matter, but ultimately
a political and diplomatic concern that is highly sensitive. Yet today,
it is the DOD that is driving assistance to countries such as
Ukraine]{.underline} and regions such as Southeast Asia.13 When Russia
invaded Ukraine in 2014, the National Security Council became
significantly involved in policymaking and limited types of assistance
that could be provided, including lethal aid.14 Such [**[unique
scrutiny]{.mark}** was [**warranted** because]{.mark} there was a
[crisis involv]{.mark}ing a U.S. partner and [a **nuclear-armed
state**]{.mark}. But]{.underline} the nature of White House intervention
was necessary in large part because [the security assistance
**process**---for both decision-making and for providing
assistance---was **broken**]{.underline}.

[[A **military-led** response]{.mark} can overprioritize military
engagement and could [**unintentionally** steer]{.mark} American
engagements [into **high-risk confrontations**]{.mark}. Without careful
calibration and understanding of broader political context, there is
real concern that the DOD could get ahead of U.S. policy or drive it in
a more military-centric direction]{.underline}. [For example, [**China**
could **interpret**]{.mark} the DOD's provision of some security
assistance]{.underline} through the agency's Southeast Asia Maritime
Security Initiative [[as an **act of aggression**]{.mark} if it is not
carefully and effectively calibrated against broader political
concerns]{.underline} in the region.15 [Given the political
sensitivities of great power competition, responsibility and
**oversight** for security assistance decisions should rest
with]{.underline} the agency most in tune with broader U.S. foreign
policy concerns and diplomatic developments: [the **State**
Department]{.underline}.

[Reforming security assistance by [**centralizing** it at]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department would help to elevate the diplomatic
considerations of this policy area, while [reduc]{.mark}ing the
military-first priorities of the current system that are ill-suited to
today's [geopolitical challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Various legislative and policy changes have attempted to modernize the
SSA paradigm to keep pace with the threat environment. The most recent
innovations, to include "1206" (now 2282) "train and equip," Global
Security Contingency Fund (GSCF), and Counterterrorism Partnership Fund
(CTPF), have received mixed reviews and assessments that generally fall
along predictable parochial lines. Nonetheless, there is broad consensus
that the current framework has become a cumbersome "patchwork" of
authorities atop an outdated foundation. Many expected, or at least
hoped, that the second decade of the 21st century would bring relief
from the post-9/11 fatigue of foreign crisis and engagements and that
this lull would allow the national security apparatus to "reset" itself
and prepare for a new model of conflict in the 21st century. However,
[the pace of **[escalating global conflict]{.mark}** in recent
years]{.underline} defied those expectations, [[leaving **little
bandwidth**]{.mark} or space]{.underline} to do more than add to, or
tinker with, the "patchwork" framework.

**\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]**

The existing SSA infrastructure is not only outdated and dysfunctional,
it is also seen as ineffective in tackling the growing mission of
building partner capacity in fragile, high-threat environments. SSA is
generally seen as effective when making gradual improvements to some
existing capabilities in countries such as in Colombia and the
Philippines and in countries where SSA is used to purchase access or
influence (Pakistan, Israel, Oman, etc). In contrast, applying SSA in
high-risk theaters with fragile political institutions (Yemen, Syria,
Iraq, Afghanistan, etc.) to build new capability has shown little
success. Despite much criticism of a system often deemed ineffective,
many stakeholders resist change for parochial reasons. In fact, there
are many actors who are better able to exercise perceived control of and
oversight of policy by utilizing the patchwork. Bureaucratic elements
often jealously guard the unique nature of these "stovepipe" authorities
because it provides influence over policy decisions via the control or
vote on the allocation of resources using such authorities. In addition,
each authority reports to a congressional committee and provides an
oversight mechanism that the congressional staffs will often strongly
defend in the face of reform initiatives. As such, additional
authorities are added that only marginally contribute to total effort
but do not streamline or incorporate previous and existing authorities.

The [[growing]{.mark} reliance on "[partnerships]{.mark}" and "building
partner capacity" **[strains]{.mark} the [D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense['s]{.mark} [ability to]{.mark} carry out its core
requirement to [be prepared to win]{.mark}**]{.underline} our nation's
[**[war]{.mark}** in the more classic model of state-on-state
conflict]{.underline}. In some cases, the partnership and BPC paradigm
is being leveraged to return to the conventional security paradigm of
preparing for state-on-state conflict, as in the case of the new South
China Sea authority in the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA). But elsewhere, and particularly in the Middle East and North
Africa, [the Defense Department [**will continue to struggle** to
**resource** and **organize** the military to support both]{.mark}
pillars one (win our nation's [wars]{.mark}) [and]{.mark} two (build
[partner capacity]{.mark}) of the QDR's strategic
framework]{.underline}. This tension could be reconciled through a
"partnership" model of defense (The Center for Strategic and
International Studies terms this "federated defense") that applies to
both paradigms of conflict and both pillars of the QDR. In many ways,
the South China Sea authority represents this way of thinking. However,
critics of this approach suggest that the U.S. has already ceded too
much leadership and influence, and exercised too much restraint, as
evidenced by the rise of Russian assertiveness relative to Eastern
Europe and the Middle East.

[Structurally, as DoD authorities increase and DoS legislation lags, the
long-running **tension between State and Defense grows**]{.underline}.
[This is a complex problem with multiple root causes. Chief among them
are the legacy stovepipes of authorities (Title 10 vs. Title 22) and
oversight committees (Armed Services vs. Foreign Affairs), the lack of
State expeditionary resources to civilian-based security sector
assistance, and a perceived lack of State agility and interagency/White
House coordination of efforts]{.underline}. In addition, [in the absence
of a common operating picture and tools to process the flood of critical
data, there is no refinement of strategic goals into complementary
concepts of operations applied against a common operational
picture]{.underline}. Other actors such as State National Guard units,
the Drug Enforcement Administration and the intelligence community are
employing Titles 32, 21, and 50, respectively, in largely disconnected
and often uncommunicated endeavors.

Figure 2. Imbalanced Security Sector Assistance (SSA) Approach

[SSA initiatives are ideally a balance between Department of State and
Department of Defense efforts, with security programs a part of broader
programs that contribute to overall governance and stability. Current
SSA is perceived to be playing a dominant role led by DoD]{.underline}.

Surely, the same principle applies in the realm of nations. Our world
teems with violent regimes and vicious men. And something precious---our
notion of peace, sovereignty, liberty, civilization itself---sits
exposed to all that danger. In a world where might makes right, **[[the
only thing that keeps]{.mark} the [peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**, defends
our sovereignty and liberty, and upholds civilization
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** the willingness to use our resources to
keep the dangers at bay. Yet too many policymakers disregard the wisdom
of **[military deterrence]{.underline}**, and too many people of faith
forget that [the aim of deterrence is, by definition, to prevent wars,
not start them.]{.underline} Some people of faith oppose the threat of
military force, let alone the use of military force, because of Christ's
message of peace. This is understandable in the abstract, but we must
keep in mind two truths. First, governments are held to a different
standard than individuals, and hence are expected to do certain things
individuals aren't expected to do---and arguably shouldn't do certain
things individuals should do. For example, a government that turned the
other cheek when attacked would be conquered by its foes, leaving
countless innocents defenseless. A government that put away the
sword---that neglected its defenses---would invite aggression, thus
jeopardizing its people. Second, all uses of force are not the same. The
sheriff who uses force to apprehend a murderer is decidedly different
from the criminal who uses force to commit a murder. The policemen
posted outside a sporting event to deter violence are decidedly
different from those who plot violence. Moral relativism is anything but
a virtue. Some lament the fact that **[we live in]{.underline}** such
**[a violent world]{.underline}**, but that's precisely the point.
Because we live in a violent world, governments must take steps to deter
those who can be deterred---and neutralize those who cannot. In this
regard, it pays to recall that Jesus had sterner words for scholars and
scribes than He did for soldiers. In fact, when a centurion asked Jesus
for help, He didn't admonish the military commander to put down his
sword. Instead, He commended him for his faith.\[i\] "Even in the
Gospels," soldier-scholar Ralph Peters reminds us, "it is assumed that
soldiers are, however regrettably, necessary."\[ii\] They are necessary
not only for waging war but, preferably, for maintaining peace. It's a
paradoxical truth that **[[military readiness]{.mark} can keep the
peace]{.underline}**. The Romans had a phrase for it: Si vis pacem, para
bellum. "If you wish for peace, prepare for war." President George
Washington put it more genteelly: "There is nothing so likely to produce
peace as to be well prepared to meet an enemy." Or, in the same way, "We
infinitely desire peace," President Theodore Roosevelt declared. "And
the surest way of obtaining it is to show that we are not afraid of
war." [After the West gambled civilization's very existence in the 1920s
and 1930s on hopes that war could somehow be outlawed, the men who
crafted the blueprint for waging the Cold War returned to peace through
strength]{.underline}. Winston Churchill proposed "defense through
deterrents." President Harry Truman called NATO "an integrated
international force whose object is to maintain peace through
strength...we devoutly pray that our present course of action will
succeed and maintain peace without war."\[iii\] President Dwight
Eisenhower explained, "Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant
action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk its own
destruction." President John Kennedy vowed to "strengthen our military
power to the point where no aggressor will dare attack." And President
Ronald Reagan steered the Cold War to a peaceful end by noting, "None of
the four wars in my lifetime came about because we were too strong."
Reagan also argued, "Our military strength is a prerequisite for
peace."\[iv\] Even so, arms alone aren't enough to deter war. After all,
the great powers were armed to the teeth in 1914. But since they weren't
clear about their intentions and treaty commitments, a small crisis on
the fringes of Europe mushroomed into a global war. Neither is clarity
alone enough to deter war. After all, President Woodrow Wilson's
admonitions to the Kaiser were clear, but America lacked the military
strength at the onset of war to make those words matter and thus deter
German aggression. In other words, America was unable to deter. "The
purpose of a deterrence force is to create a set of conditions that
would cause an adversary to conclude that the cost of any particular act
against the United States of America or her allies is far higher than
the potential benefit of that act," explains Gen. Kevin Chilton, former
commander of U.S. Strategic Command. It is a "cost-benefit
calculus."\[v\] So, given the anemic state of America's military before
1917, the Kaiser calculated that the benefits of attacking U.S. ships
and trying to lure Mexico into an alliance outweighed the costs. That
proved to be a grave miscalculation. **[In order [for the adversary not
to miscalc]{.mark}ulate]{.underline}**, a few **[factors must
hold]{.underline}**. First, **[consequences must be
clear]{.underline}**, which was not the case on the eve of World War I.
Critics of deterrence often cite World War I to argue that arms races
trigger wars. But if it were that simple, then a) there wouldn't have
been a World War II, since the Allies allowed their arsenals to atrophy
after 1918, and b) there would have been a World War III, since
Washington and Moscow engaged in an unprecedented arms race. The reality
is that miscalculation lit the fuse of World War I. The antidote, as
alluded to above, is strength plus clarity. A second important factor to
avoid miscalculation: The adversary must be rational, which means it can
grasp and fear consequences. [Fear is an essential ingredient of
deterrence]{.underline}. It pays to recall that deterrence comes from
the Latin dēterreō: "to frighten off."\[vi\] Of course, as Churchill
conceded, "The deterrent does not cover the case of lunatics."\[vii\]
Mass-murderers masquerading as holy men and death-wish dictators may be
immune from deterrence. (The secondary benefit of the
peace-through-strength model is that it equips those who embrace it with
the capacity to defeat these sorts of enemies rapidly and return to the
status quo ante.) Third, **[the [consequences]{.mark} of military
confrontation [must be]{.mark} credible and
[tangible]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which was the case during most of the
Cold War. Not only did Washington and Moscow construct vast military
arsenals to deter one another; they were clear about their treaty
commitments and about the consequences of any threat to those
commitments. Recall how Eisenhower answered Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev's boast about the Red Army's overwhelming conventional
advantage in Germany: "If you attack us in Germany," the steely American
commander-in-chief fired back, "there will be nothing conventional about
our response."\[viii\] Eisenhower's words were unambiguously clear, and
unlike Wilson, he wielded the military strength to give them
credibility. Discussing military deterrence in the context of
Christianity may seem incongruent to some readers. But for a pair of
reasons it is not. First, [deterrence is not just a matter of GDPs and
geopolitics]{.underline}. In fact, scripture often uses the language of
deterrence and preparedness. For example, in the first chapter of
Numbers the Lord directs Moses and Aaron to count "all the men in Israel
who are twenty years old or more and able to serve in the army." This
ancient selective-service system is a form of military readiness.
Similarly, I Chronicles 27 provides detail about the Israelites' massive
standing army: twelve divisions of 24,000 men each. II Chronicles 17
explains the military preparations made by King Jehoshaphat of Judah, a
king highly revered for his piety, who built forts, maintained armories
in strategically located cities "with large supplies" and fielded an
army of more than a million men "armed for battle." Not surprisingly,
"the fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding
Judah, so that they did not go to war against Jehoshaphat." In the New
Testament, Paul writes in Romans 13 that "Rulers hold no terror for
those who do right, but for those who do wrong...Rulers do not bear the
sword for no reason." Again, this is the language of deterrence. Those
who follow the law within a country and who respect codes of conduct
between countries have nothing to fear. Those who don't have much to
fear. Likewise, to explain the importance of calculating the costs of
following Him, Jesus asks in Luke 14, "What king would go to war against
another king without first sitting down to consider whether his 10,000
soldiers could go up against the 20,000 coming against him? And if he
didn't think he could win, he would send a representative to discuss
terms of peace while his enemy was still a long way off." In a sense,
both kings are wise---one because he recognizes that he's outnumbered;
the other because he makes sure that he's not. Put another way, both
kings subscribe to peace through strength. Again, as with the Centurion
earlier, Jesus could have rebuked the martial character of these kings,
but he did not. This is not just description but commendation. We ignore
their example at our peril. Secondly, it is not incongruent if **[we
understand military deterrence as a means to prevent great-power
war]{.underline}**---**[the kind that kills by the
millions]{.underline}**, the kind humanity has not endured for seven
decades. We know we will not experience the biblical notion of
peace---of shalom, peace with harmony and justice---until Christ returns
to make all things new. In the interim, in a broken world, the
alternatives to peace through strength leave much to be desired: peace
through hope, peace through violence, or peace through submission. But
these options are inadequate. The sheer destructiveness and totality of
great-power war testify that crossing our fingers and hoping for peace
is not a Christian option. Wishful thinking, romanticizing reality, is
the surest way to invite what Churchill called "temptations to a trial
of strength." Moreover, the likelihood that **[[the next]{.mark}
great-power [war would involve multiple nuclear-weapons states]{.mark}
means that it [could end civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[Therefore]{.underline}, **[[a posture that leaves]{.mark} peer
[adversaries doubting]{.mark} the West's [capabilities]{.mark} and
resolve]{.underline}**---**[thus [inviting
miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}**---**[is not only unsound, but
immoral and inhumane]{.underline}**---unchristian. "Deterrence of war is
more humanitarian than anything," Gen. Park Yong Ok, a longtime South
Korean military official, argues. "**[If we fail to deter war, a
tremendous number of civilians will be killed]{.underline}**."\[ix\]
Peace through violence has been tried throughout history. Pharaoh,
Caesar and Genghis Khan, Lenin, Hitler, Stalin and Mao, all attained a
kind of peace by employing brutal forms of violence. However, this is
not the kind of "peace" under which God's crowning creation can
flourish; neither would the world long tolerate such a scorched-earth
"peace." This option, too, the Christian rejects. Finally, the civilized
world could bring about peace simply by not resisting the enemies of
civilization---by not blunting the Islamic State's blitzkrieg of Iraq;
by not defending the 38th Parallel; by not standing up to Beijing's
land-grab in the South China Sea or Moscow's bullying of the Baltics or
al-Qaeda's death creed; by not having armies or, for that matter,
police. As Reagan said, "There's only one guaranteed way you can have
peace---and you can have it in the next second---surrender."\[x\] The
world has tried these alternatives to peace through strength, and the
outcomes have been disastrous. After World War I, Western powers
disarmed and convinced themselves they had waged the war to end all
wars. By 1938, as Churchill concluded after Munich, the Allies had been
"reduced...from a position of security so overwhelming and so
unchallengeable that we never cared to think about it."\[xi\] Like
predators in the wilderness, the Axis powers sensed weakness and
attacked. In October 1945---not three months after the Missouri steamed
into Tokyo Bay---Gen. George Marshall decried the "disintegration not
only of the Armed Forces, but apparently...all conception of world
responsibility," warily asking, "Are we already, at this early date,
inviting that same international disrespect that prevailed before this
war?"\[xii\] Stalin answered Marshall's question by gobbling up half of
Europe, blockading Berlin, and arming Kim Il-Sung in patient preparation
for the invasion of South Korea.\[xiii\] The U.S. military had taken up
positions in Korea in 1945, but withdrew all combat forces in
1949.\[xiv\] Then, in 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson announced
that Japan, Alaska and the Philippines fell within America's "defensive
perimeter."\[xv\] Korea didn't. Stalin noticed. Without a U.S. deterrent
in place, Stalin gave Kim a green light to invade. Washington then
reversed course and rushed American forces back into Korea, and the
Korean peninsula plunged into one of the most ferocious wars in history.
The cost of miscalculation in Washington and Moscow: 38,000 Americans,
103,250 South Korean troops, 316,000 North Korean troops, 422,000
Chinese troops and 2 million civilian casualties.\[xvi\] The North
Korean tyranny--- now under command of Kim's grandson---still dreams of
conquering South Korea. The difference between 2015 and 1950 is that
tens of thousands of battle-ready U.S. and ROK troops are stationed on
the border. They've been there every day since 1953. The lesson of
history is that waging war is far more costly than maintaining a
military capable of deterring war. As Washington observed, "Timely
disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater
disbursements to repel it." Just compare military allocations, as a
percentage of GDP, during times of war and times of peace: In the eight
years before entering World War I, the United States devoted an average
of 0.7 percent of GDP to defense; during the war, U.S. defense spending
spiked to 16.1 percent of GDP. In the decade before entering World War
II, the United States spent an average of 1.1 percent of GDP on defense;
during the war, the U.S. diverted an average of 27 percent of GDP to the
military annually. During the Cold War, Washington spent an average of 7
percent of GDP on defense to deter Moscow; it worked. Yet it seems we
have forgotten those hard-learned lessons. In his book The World America
Made, Robert Kagan explains how "[America's most important role has been
to dampen and deter the normal tendencies of other great powers to
compete and jostle with one another in ways that historically have led
to war]{.underline}." **[This role has depended on America's military
might]{.underline}**. "**[There is no better recipe for great-power
peace]{.underline}**," Kagan concludes, "**[than certainty about who
holds the upper hand]{.underline}**."\[xvii\]

One central argument of State's advocates is that [**[DoD's parallel
s]{.mark}ecurity-[a]{.mark}ssistance apparatus [undermines
statecraft]{.mark}**. [By creating a **second track**]{.mark} where
nations can go to get American military goods, **[ambassadors]{.mark} in
the field [are robbed of key carrots and sticks]{.mark}** when pushing
on issues such as human rights]{.underline}.

For example, in 2015, Kenya received \$48.2 million in funding for 1206
counterterrorism train-and-equip missions, according to figures compiled
by Security Assistance Monitor. That same year, a State Department human
rights report cited Kenya's \"security force abuses, including alleged
unlawful killings, forced disappearances, torture, and use of excessive
force; interethnic violence; and widespread corruption and impunity.\"

\"Talk to [the military]{.underline} guys coming back from Africa or
Asia and they [say, 'We're just running the mission, we don't worry
about diplomatic aspects]{.underline} or the relationships being
formulated, [we're building mil-to-mil bridges]{.underline},\'\" Stohl
said. \"It's an important relationship, one that should be cultivated,
but it is not separate from the diplomatic and foreign policy
relationships that have to be developed and take time. [If you lose the
foreign policy piece and just focus on the security piece, you're doing
a disservice to the larger strategic objectives]{.underline}.\"

Streamlining Authorities

The Senate-passed bill would collapse the collection of
security-cooperation authorities from Title 10 and elsewhere into a
single chapter of US law. It also repeals the Pentagon's many
\"train-and-equip\" policies and rolls them into a single authority.

It consolidates more than \$2 billion in security-cooperating funding
into a new Security Cooperation Enhancement Fund, a balm to senior DoD
officials who were scraping dollars together from various accounts. In
return, the defense secretary must submit an annual budget
justification, report on the effectiveness of its efforts, and take
responsibility for management oversight.

While the bill doesn't give the Pentagon new authorities, it allows more
flexibility within the framework, said Rand Senior Analyst Michael
McNerney. While that has sparked fears at the State Department that the
bill would grant DoD with a slush fund, McNerney said that appears to be
balanced with greater congressional oversight.

\"I think they felt it was a worthwhile tradeoff to give the Pentagon
more flexibility if they can start showing their work,\" McNerney said
of the bill.

\"Building security capabilities of a partner nation through security
cooperation requires a specialized set of skills, and the current system
neither develops those skills among its workforce nor rationally assigns
its workforce to match appropriate skills with requirements,\" a bill
summary reads.

Those who crafted the bill say it was drafted to comply with a 2013
White House directive on security assistance, Presidential Policy
Directive 23, which is meant to define the security cooperation status
quo for the State Department and the Pentagon.

\"The Senate NDAA was deliberately designed to be consistent with that
directive, which maintained the State Department's primacy on foreign
policy and security-sector assistance, but also acknowledged DoD has an
important role in security-sector assistance,\" Walker said. \"We worked
hard to thread that needle.\"

In the patchwork of authorities, some DoD security cooperation programs
gave State concurrence authority while others mandated
\"joint-formulation\" programs, meaning State and DoD would plan
programs together from inception. In the Senate's consolidation plans,
State would gain concurrence but lose \"joint formulation\" rights.

According to Walker, the two sides need to come together on a process to
plan and prioritize together.

\"Everyone recognizes that there have been shortcomings on both sides in
planning and prioritizing integrated security-cooperation efforts,\"
Walker said. \"Congress has to continue to work with DoD and State to
ensure we achieve the unity of effort we all seek.\"

Pro-State government officials, speaking on background, were not as
conciliatory. The new legislative action, they fear, would spell the end
of a meaningful role for State because DoD's structure would legitimize
[a **separate foreign-assistance avenue** controlled by the
military]{.underline}. And [because the military tends to beat diplomacy
in budget fights]{.underline}, the system [would by default **tilt
toward the Pentagon**]{.underline}, the thinking goes.

And those backing State fear that [**[losing the ability to
attach]{.mark}** human-rights and geopolitical **[concerns to weapon
s]{.mark}ales [or training]{.mark}** will blow up in the face of the US
government]{.underline}. They point out how arming a nation like the
Philippines to counter China, with a focus solely on the military
results and not the greater political picture, could end up with a
US-backed nation striking against the larger Pacific country.

\"I'd rather have a system that is duplicative and wasteful than see it
all go under the Pentagon,\" said one US government official. \"At some
point, doing so will cause a huge \[geopolitical\] problem.\"

Congressional Action

It's unclear how much traction State's concerns will have in Congress.
Crucially, the White House mentioned the matter in its policy statement
on the Senate's NDAA but stopped short of threatening a veto over it.

State does have allies. The Senate Appropriations State and Foreign
Operations and Related Programs Subcommittee --- chaired by Sen. Lindsey
Graham, R-S.C. --- pushed back against the NDAA language in its
appropriations bill, approved by the panel on June 29.

It cites existing law to assert \"the primacy of the Secretary of State
in the conduct of foreign affairs,\" pushing to enshrine the secretary's
\"responsibility for the continuous supervision and general direction\"
of economic, law-enforcement, justice-sector and military assistance, to
include military training programs.

The report blames the National Security Council, under President Obama
and previous administrations, for failing to coordinate relevant
policies for better cooperation. That, combined with [ad-hoc responses
to recent crises, \"created parallel and competing foreign-assistance
programs]{.underline}, particularly [at the Department of
Defense]{.underline},\" the report said.

[When these programs are allowed proceed outside \"a
whole-of-government\" approach under the direction of]{.underline} the
president and the secretary of [state, it \"erodes the coherent,
coordinated, and effective implementation of U.S. foreign
policy]{.underline},\" the report warned.

When Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg appointed experts to examine

alliance's founding principles and **no financial carrots** that might
incentivize good behavior]{.underline}.

Good Intentions Won't Be Enough

In his first months in office, President Biden has already demonstrated
a desire to defend trans-Atlantic values. Recognizing the Armenian
genocide and adopting sanctions against Russia and China in coordination
with Europe are only the most recent examples. But how Biden plans to
translate this democratic agenda into concrete action in NATO remains
unclear. [A mere declaration of good intentions won't be
enough]{.underline}. As NATO adapts for the next decade through the
"NATO 2030" process, leaders should seize the opportunity to adopt
concrete solutions to defend democratic values and ultimately uphold
NATO's political cohesion.

A first and most essential step would be the adoption by NATO leaders of
a "political pledge" by which allies would recommit to abide by the
principles of the North Atlantic Treaty. These principles are often
mentioned in NATO's official communiques but in a cursory way,
reflecting the limited attention given to them. The NATO 2030 reflection
group promoted a similar idea with its proposed "code of good conduct."
Substance-wise, allies should pledge to uphold trans-Atlantic values ---
including democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law --- but also to
respect some principles of good behavior, such as consulting allies on
national decisions impacting trans-Atlantic security, refraining from
blocking matters external to NATO, and making good faith efforts to
settle any dispute with another ally. This "pledge" could be part of the
communique adopted by NATO leaders in Brussels or a stand-alone
document. At a minimum, these principles should be imbedded in the new
strategic concept that NATO is likely to launch at the June 14 summit.

Next, NATO should monitor individual allies' compliance with these
principles. [Without any monitoring mechanism, a political declaration
risks becoming little more than a declaration of good
intentions]{.underline}. First, allies should be able to raise their
concerns to the North Atlantic Council or even at the ministerial level
when they believe that a serious violation of the "pledge" by a NATO
member is occurring. Such discussion would force that member to justify
its decisions and create political pressure in itself. Allies could also
institute a regular review of each country's compliance with NATO's core
values and link it to NATO's baseline requirements for national
resilience. This periodic report would be prepared by the International
Secretariat under the authority of the assistant secretary general for
political affairs or the deputy secretary general. NATO could build on
existing metrics used by the European Union or by nongovernmental
organizations such as Freedom House. Finally, joint NATO-European Union
"resilience response teams" could provide advice or assistance to
allies, such as those new NATO members in the Balkans, which might want
help addressing their societal vulnerabilities. Their efforts could draw
on existing resources such as NATO's centers of excellence on cyber,
strategic communications, and hybrid threats. Taken together, these
procedures would provide the basis for a periodic discussion on the
political health of the alliance.

A last but challenging step would be [[to **raise the political
cost**]{.mark} **for allies breaking the rules**]{.underline}. This [is
admittedly the most difficult course of action given NATO's consensus
rule and the aforementioned lack of legal mechanisms to sanction or
expel]{.underline}. Here, NATO will need to be creative and use a
mixture of incentives and disincentives. In terms of incentives, allies
should make clear that decisions on NATO leadership positions, facility
placement, or ministerial locations will be evaluated in light of the
respect for NATO's values. If this fails to induce better behavior,
[allies [should]{.mark}]{.underline} move to publicize violations or
[consider restrictive measures such as **[cancel]{.mark}ling
[exercises]{.mark}** or NATO events [or **limit**]{.mark}**ing
[participation]{.mark}** [in **military planning** or
**intel**]{.mark}ligence **[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For less
sensitive measures such as cancelling visits of NATO officials or
appointing assistant secretary generals, these measures could be
implemented directly by the International Secretariat. For other, more
sensitive measures, the alliance might be forced to consider a
"consensus minus one" approach. Finally, additional [[**pressure** can
be brought through]{.mark} bilateral]{.underline} or European Union
[channels, thereby [harnessing]{.mark} other instruments of power such
as **financial [incentives]{.mark}** in support of NATO
objectives]{.underline}.

The State Department, in coordination with the DOD, the National
Security Council, and other relevant agencies, should implement a policy
planning process that includes defining outcomes and goals for the
provision of U.S. aid. This should include weighing security, political,
and economic factors in a partnership, and assessing what kind of
support a country should receive. [[By **centralizing
s**]{.mark}**ecurity [a]{.mark}ssistance** [at]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department, U.S. officials [would]{.mark} be able
**[consider the entire range of concerns]{.mark}** in bilateral
relationships. **Pushing forward security assistance without**
adequately considering the partner's capacity to effectively absorb
assistance---or assessing whether the partner will use it properly and
not commit abuses with U.S. weapons and training---can be wasteful at
best or **extremely dangerous** at worst]{.underline}. For example,
despite the U.S. Africa Command spending millions of dollars on security
training and support in Mali before 2011, the government quickly
collapsed in the face of an insurgent force enabled by
al-Qaida-affiliated groups---a clear failure of U.S. security assistance
goals.87 Reforms to security assistance must focus on expediting the
process only after a comprehensive deliberation on a range of issues has
occurred.

Congress should also grant more flexibility to the State Department to
guide allocations. [If State Department leaders determine that
appropriations for a given partner would not best be utilized for
security assistance, the State Department should have the flexibility
and authority to provide political or economic aid instead]{.underline}.
This could help address today's challenge where U.S. security assistance
is provided to fragile states that lack effective institutions or
accountable, transparent processes to effectively utilize security aid.
Benchmarks should be also established that would help determine whether
U.S. assistance is helping partners build more capacity and use U.S.
equipment and training in the right ways.88

DoD should rescind the directive and make a more compelling case for
NSPD 44. The success of NSPD 44 should be part of DoD's legislative
agenda. The robust program, budgeting and legislative affairs apparatus
in DoD should support DoS by assisting with planning, developing a
strategic communications program to influence lawmakers, and preparing
for interagency hearings on Capitol Hill. DoD should provide funding,
manpower and expertise to assist State with organizing, training, and
exercising a real capability. Members of the National Guard and Reserves
with critical skills should be made available to State to execute
stability operations under DoS, not DoD lead.

Foreign Policy," Senate Hearing 115-666, Committee on Foreign Relations,

This is the committee\'s second hearing on security assistance in just
over a year, but it is an issue that has been raised during many of our
other meetings. This kind of assistance is an investment in our own
security. We help ourselves by helping other nations police their own
neighborhoods. Which nations we help and how we help them are crucial
foreign policy decisions.

Since the 1960s, [the law provides that the Secretary of
**State**]{.underline}, under the direction of the President, [has the
responsibility for the continuous **supervision** and general
**direction** of economic assistance, **military assistance**, and
training programs]{.underline}. We need to be clear on that because our
security demands that we work across agency lines to develop coherent
security assistance programs that serve our interests and those of our
partners.

While [[the **Defense**]{.mark} **Department**]{.underline} has long
played an important role in this area, since 9/11 that [[**role** has
**grown enormously**]{.mark} in size [and]{.mark} scope]{.underline}.
[We **[cannot tackle the real challenges if we are fighting turf
wars]{.mark}** within other bureaucracies. And while
**[teamwork]{.mark}** is necessary, it **[is not
enough]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

We need clear goals and a way to keep track of how we are doing. Between
State and DOD, we are spending about \$18 billion a year on security
sector assistance. As General Hooper said the other day, [this is not a
pickup game. We **need professionals**]{.underline}.

Last year, Congress consolidated many of the narrow and overlapping
authorities on the defense side, and it has given the Defense Department
more flexible and global train and equip authority. I was pleased that
the measure signed into law requires the concurrence of the Secretary of
State for these activities and encourages both departments to jointly
develop and plan such programs.

I would like to hear from our OSD and State witnesses on the question of
concurrence versus coordination as it pertains to security cooperation
activities already in progress such as the counter-ISIS train and equip.

At the State Department, significant security assistance roles are held
by four different functional bureaus, each with their own budget, plus
all of the regional bureaus. And these bureaus report down through four
different secretaries, making it difficult to see who is in charge.
[Under this [current **organizational structure**]{.mark}, I [have
concerns about]{.mark} the Department\'s [ability to **manage its own
programs** while also reviewing]{.mark} and shaping **[DOD
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I hope the
**[[redesign]{.underline}]{.mark}** plan **[[will address this]{.mark}
matter]{.underline}**, and any insight our witnesses could share to that
process will be greatly appreciated.

For the UOW to be able to plan and implement effective strategy, the
bureaucratic culture in much of Congress and the government agencies
must significantly evolve. Political culture in Washington, D.C. is risk
averse and focused on election cycles rather than countering long-term
strategic goals of U.S. adversaries. [**[Turf wars]{.mark}** and tunnel
vision [plague interagency relationships, and tensions between **civil**
and **military** leadership create **barriers to

facilitate unconventional warfare strategy development. The President
and the National Security Advisor [**[must empower]{.mark}** the
**[State]{.mark}** Department]{.underline} and the OUW [[to **enforce
coordination**]{.mark} of long-term interagency efforts supporting
American foreign policy]{.underline}. This requires special selection
and development of adaptive leadership that is willing to work together
in creative, closely coordinated, and synchronized operations under
guidance by the State Department and the National Security Council to
achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives. The Council on Foreign Relations
suggests the creation of political warfare career tracks in relevant
government agencies, which would establish a trained community of
political warfare expertise in the government to help sustain long-term
operations and planning.\[xvi\]

[Recent efforts to reform the security assistance
architecture]{.underline} tend to [get bogged down by the complexity of
the current system]{.underline}. This has [led to an **inevitable**
focus on **incremental tweaks** that address tactical-level
concerns]{.underline}. These weedy discussions, while useful, often
[take the current structure of the U.S. security assistance system as a
given---and therefore, **do not address** the broader **strategic** and
**budgetary** issues and **imbalance between diplomacy and
defense**]{.underline}. Furthermore, policymakers and politicians often
get lost in the technical nature of these discussions, lack broader
historical context, and are easily persuaded by officials with a stake
in largely preserving the status quo and in protecting their offices,
who tout the complexity of the challenge; as a result, they quickly lose
interest in reform. A new administration should be wary of these past
mistakes when embarking on suggested reforms in this report.

Obama administration efforts attempted to improve interagency
cooperation

During the first years of the Obama administration, White House
officials led an interagency review of U.S. security assistance policy.
The result, Presidential Policy Directive 23, established goals and
policy guidelines for U.S. security assistance in 2013 and sought to
increase interagency, meaning State Department-DOD, collaboration.51 But
there were challenges in implementing these reforms. For example, the
Global Security Contingency Fund (GSCF) was created under the Obama
administration as an experimental program designed as a joint effort,
housed at the State Department with staff from both agencies and new
funds to pool resources.52 But the GSCF turned out to be
bureaucratically unwieldy and ultimately unsuccessful: Because it was
housed at the State Department and the DOD, eight congressional
committees exerted oversight, and projects were easily stymied by
skeptical staffers.53 It also lacked institutional buy-in from the DOD,
which was slow to provide staff and resources and focused on working
around the State Department instead.

Congressional efforts have primarily focused on the DOD's resources

[Rather than concentrate on the overall security assistance landscape,
congressional reform efforts focused entirely on consolidating DOD
authorities and bridging silos within the existing system]{.underline}.
For example, [the]{.underline} fiscal year [**2017 NDAA** sought to
institutionalize DOD assistance by merging many of the Pentagon's
authorities]{.underline} into a "new, broader global train and equip
authority," creating a new Section 333 under the DOD's Title 10
authority.54 [But]{.underline} Section 333 [is essentially **redundant**
to many of the State Department's authorities]{.underline}, including
FMF; International Narcotics and Law Enforcement; and Nonproliferation,
Anti-terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs. And while the
authorization calls for the "concurrence" of the secretary of state, [in
practice, it leaves the **State** Department with **very little
leverage** and little ability to shape DOD programs]{.underline}. Some
analysts found, "There are varying degrees of Section 333 implementation
and buy-in from combatant command leadership," with some [viewing the
State Department-DOD integration as a **check-the-box
exercise**]{.underline}.55

[While there have been some notable attempts]{.underline}, such as
2019's Department of State Authorization Act in the House of
Representatives,56 [Congress has failed to enact any major legislation
to modernize State Department authorities or resources]{.underline}.
Moreover, [these reforms to the DOD's security assistance authorities
did nothing to improve the State Department's authorities]{.underline};
though Section 333 included reporting requirements that are considered a
"gold standard" for assessing a partner's capacity to absorb U.S.
assistance, such assessments are not required for assistance from the
State Department.57

Inhibits congressional oversight

[By creating **two separate security assistance bureaucracies**---one at
the State Department and one at the DOD---there is **no uniform
oversight** of security assistance by Congress]{.underline}. [**DOD**
security assistance]{.underline} residing in Title 10 [is a relatively
**tiny piece**]{.underline}---comprising about [2 percent]{.underline}
of the overall DOD budget---[of the oversight jurisdiction for the
Senate and House Armed Services committees and DOD
appropriators]{.underline}. [Meanwhile, the assistance under **State**
Department authorities]{.underline} comprises a far more significant
proportion of the State Department budget---about 15 percent---and
therefore can be [subject to **more expert attention**]{.underline}.

Congressional staff are expected to review a continuous flow of
piecemeal security assistance notifications from the executive branch
and track reports about the myriad authorities. [Many congressional
staff report being **unable to keep up** with reviewing even the biggest
program, and reports---even those made public---are rarely reviewed in
any depth]{.underline}.74 [Moreover, these committees rarely talk to
each other or coordinate over specific security assistant programs. They
also jealously guard their jurisdictions and have a poor track record of
communication, let alone cooperation]{.underline}.75

[As a result, security assistance rarely gets a vetting]{.underline}
before the public eye. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has held
two hearings on security assistance in the last 10 years---and tends to
focus on the foreign policy dimensions of the most problematic
partnerships.76 [Congressional notification requirements are not uniform
and only mandated for certain types of authorities, making it impossible
to see a "full and authoritative accounting" of U.S. security assistance
funding around the world]{.underline}.77

1\. Consolidate, rationalize, and rebalance the many security assistance
and cooperation authorities. [[With]{.mark} a glut of [new authorities,
policymakers]{.mark} have begun [us]{.mark}ing them [in a]{.mark}
piecemeal and [disconnected fashion]{.mark}. In addition to the
imbalance and lack of [coordination between State and DoD]{.mark}
authorities, the connection between Title 10 and Title 22 authorities
[has been lost, and State's position as]{.mark} the [lead]{.mark} agency
in determining the strategy and direction of security assistance [has
been diluted]{.mark}]{.underline}. DoD and State [[should]{.mark}
develop a coordinated reform proposal that **[consolidate]{.mark}s**
DoD's glut of new and overlapping authorities [and
**transfer**]{.mark}**s**]{.underline} the appropriate [**[authorities
to State]{.mark}**, **[even if administration remains under
DoD]{.mark}'s purview [in certain cases]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Consolidation should also ensure that the provision of assistance and
cooperation can be done through regional budgetary funds and to
consortia of partners. Finally, the proposals should be presented to the
Senate and House Armed Services Committees, the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Congress should
commission a study by the Congressional Research Service, GAO, or an
independent commission to produce new proposals and hold hearings on
these proposals to solicit insight and recommendations. The collective
findings should inform new legislation codifying the necessary reforms
to the post-September 11, 2001, authorities.

2\. Undertake regional reviews of security assistance and cooperation
programs. Because some of the objectives of security assistance and
cooperation will always conflict and there will continue to be debates
about how to scope U.S. objectives, it is incumbent on policymakers to
candidly prioritize goals, delineate where they are willing to accept
risks, and plan ahead to mitigate anticipated consequences associated
with these risks. This is best done through a regional framework. The
National Security Council should direct representatives from the
regional bureaus at State and in the Office of the Secretary of Defense
at DoD to work together to produce joint reviews of U.S. security
assistance and cooperation in their respective regions. Each review
should prioritize U.S. interests and objectives in the relevant region,
provide relevant updates on the regional environment, and delineate how
assistance and cooperation are being deployed to realize U.S.
objectives. Reviews should also identify where objectives conflict as
well as where U.S. policymakers are taking clear risks as they weigh and
make trade-offs among U.S. foreign policy priorities. Policymakers need
to discuss ways in which to mitigate these risks. These reviews should
clearly delineate short- and long-term goals and identify where these
are complementary or in conflict. In the event of potential conflicts or
moral hazard, reviews must make a clear case for why they are
prioritizing either short- or long-term objectives. Over time these
reviews should take into account new methods of measuring outcomes.
These reviews should inform and be informed by an ongoing effort by
embassy-based diplomats, defense attachés and Office of Security
Cooperation chiefs to coordinate their security assistance and
cooperation plans in the field in order to identify areas for potential
cooperation and conflict. State should have ultimate responsibility for
coordinating and producing the final product for the National Security
Council (NSC). Finally, the president should establish a commission
composed of outside experts and former officials to assess and provide
feedback periodically on these regional reviews and to offer external,
objective views on these documents.

3\. Increase the use of regionally-appropriated funds for assistance and
cooperation where appropriate. The overwhelming amount of security
assistance and cooperation is still provided bilaterally to individual
countries despite the admonition in PPD 23 that these efforts must be
linked to a broader regional approach, including cross-border program
coordination, support for regional organizations, and facilitation of
linkages among partner countries. Seeking regionally-appropriated funds
would advance this cause and could have the ancillary benefit of
reducing the entitlement problem. Not all regional security
organizations are similarly equipped to receive U.S. assistance. In the
Middle East, for example, subregional institutions are weak and so
regional assistance to organizations such as the Gulf Cooperation
Council will need to be calibrated accordingly.

4\. Improve interagency coordination and enhance State's capacity to
manage security assistance programs. In addition to the other steps
recommended to improve the integration of security assistance and
cooperation, better awareness and coordination among different agencies
is necessary. A new mechanism should be created to allow foreign and
civil service officers from the country desks at State and personnel
from DSCA and the Defense Technology Security Administration at DoD to
serve in six-- twelve-month rotations at the other's agency. These
rotations will help the State Department to build a cadre of diplomats
and civil servants with a deeper understanding of the mechanics of
security assistance and cooperation.

[[To **augment its capacity**]{.mark} to manage]{.underline} or
contribute to the management of [security assistance, the **State**
Department will also need to **hire more people** and reform its
personnel management practices. More FSOs should be trained to oversee
security assistance programs and incentivized to choose this as a career
track]{.underline}.57 [Increasing the number of FSOs with the financial,
legal, legislative, and programmatic skills to work on the details of
security assistance [would]{.mark} help **[correct the imbalance between
State and DoD]{.mark}** that is particularly pervasive in the
field]{.underline}.

Terminology

[The two terms most commonly used today for assistance to foreign
military and security forces are "security assistance" and "security
cooperation." **Security assistance is the term most frequently used,
regardless of the agency** providing that assistance.]{.underline}

**[There is no State Department definition for security
assistance]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline} annual **[State
Department]{.underline}** congressional budget justification (CBJ),
however, [lists six budget accounts under the heading "International
Security Assistance." These accounts, with their underlying **Title 22**
authorities (the 1961 **FAA** and the **AECA**), are **commonly
regarded** as the State Department's **security assistance**
portfolio]{.underline}.

[**DOD formally defines security assistance as** the group of State
Department 1961 **FAA** and **AECA** programs that a DOD organization,
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (**DSCA**), **administers**.
These include programs conducted under two of the State Department
international security assistance accounts and attendant authorities, as
well as programs conducted under four related 1961 FAA and AECA
authorities]{.underline}.

[[**DOD** uses the **overarching term** **"security cooperation"** to
denote]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark} Department [security
assistance]{.mark}** [**administered by DSCA**]{.mark}]{.underline}
through which the U.S. government furnishes defense articles, military
training, and other defense-related services, [**[as well as all other
DOD interactions]{.mark}** with foreign defense
establishments]{.underline}. The purposes of the interactions with
foreign defense establishments defined as security cooperation are to
"build defense relationships that promote specific U.S. security
interests, develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multilateral operations, and provide US forces with
peacetime and contingency access to a host nation."8

G.2. **[DEFINITIONS]{.underline}**. Unless otherwise noted, these terms
and their definitions are for the purposes of this issuance.

**country-specific security cooperation section**. A section of the
theater campaign plan in which the GCCs articulate their intent to apply
time, money, and effort through security cooperation programs in a
specific country to further U.S. defense objectives or set the theater
for a potential contingency in their campaign plan. Country-specific
security cooperation sections serve as the core organizing documents for
articulating DoD country-level objectives for the application of
security cooperation at the country level, and inform and are informed
by corresponding Integrated Country Strategies.

**Integrated Country Strategy**. Defined in Presidential Policy
Directive 23.

**international agreements**. Agreements binding under international law
that facilitate defense and security cooperation with allied and partner
nations and international organizations.

**defense institution building**. Defined in DoDD 5205.82.

**SCOs**. DoD organizations permanently located in foreign countries and
assigned responsibilities for carrying out security cooperation
management functions in accordance with Section 515 of the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961. SCOs may include military assistance advisory
groups, military missions and groups, and Offices of Defense and
Military Cooperation, designated to perform security cooperation
functions. SCOs do not include units, formations, or other ad hoc
organizations that conduct security cooperation activities, such as
mobile training and education teams, or operational units.

**senior defense official/defense attaché**. The chief of mission's
principal military advisor on defense and national security issues, or
the senior diplomatically accredited DoD military point of contact for
all DoD matters involving the embassy or DoD elements assigned to or
working from the embassy. The senior defense official/defense attaché in
the U.S. Mission can be the defense attaché or the chief of the SCO, as
designated by the Secretary of Defense.

**security assistance**. Group of programs authorized by the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act of 1976 or other

**Introduction**

The term security cooperation was first introduced in 1997 by the
Defense Reform Initiative (DRI). At that time, the Defense Security
Assistance Agency (DSAA) already had day-to-day management
responsibilities of many security assistance programs authorized by the
Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) and the Armed Export Control Act (AECA).
The DRI proposed that DSAA also manage certain Department of Defense
(DoD)-funded international programs along with their personnel and
associated resources. In order for U.S. government (USG) agencies, the
private sector, and foreign governments to better understand DSAA's
enlarged mission and diverse functions beyond security assistance (SA),
DoD re-designated DSAA as the Defense Security Cooperation Agency
(DSCA), effective 1 October 1998.

In recent years, DSCA has absorbed management responsibilities for many
DoD international programs while also leading the wider USG security
cooperation enterprise. However, many security cooperation programs
continue to be managed by other elements of the Office of the Secretary
of Defense (OSD), the combatant commands (CCMDs), or the military
departments (MILDEPs). Further complicating the management of security
cooperation was the in-country point of contact between the USG and the
host nation. This point of contact was either the Defense Intelligence
Agency (DIA)- sponsored Defense Attaché Office (DAO) or the
DSCA-sponsored Security Cooperation Office (SCO). These two spigots of
security cooperation within a country required a broad knowledge and
skill baseline of the very different international programs that are
initiated, funded, and managed throughout the DoD, its agencies and the
MILDEPs. Most disconnects regarding SCO-DAO coordination of in-country
security cooperation were generally resolved with the establishment of
the Senior Defense Officials/Defense Attaché (SDO/DATT) having oversight
over both the SCO and DAO organizations.

On 9 June 2004 that [DoD published a **[formal]{.mark}**]{.underline},
yet still very broad, [[**definition** of **security
coop**]{.mark}**eration** [in]{.mark}]{.underline} Joint Pub

[**DODD 5132.03**, [**DoD Policy** and]{.mark} Responsibilities Relating
to Security Cooperation]{.underline}, 29 December [2016, further
**defines security cooperation** with assigned
responsibilities:]{.underline}

[According to **Title 10 [U.S. Code]{.mark} Section 301**, the term
"**security cooperation**]{.underline} programs and activities of the
Department of Defense" [means **any program, activity (including an
exercise), or interaction of the DoD with the security establishment of
a foreign country** to achieve a purpose as follows: (A) To build and
develop allied and friendly security capabilities for self-defense and
multinational operations. (B) To provide the armed forces with access to
the foreign country during peacetime or a contingency operation. (C) To
build relationships that promote specific United States security
interests]{.underline}. Other DoD policy statements [[identify
**DoD-**]{.mark}managed or **[administered security assistance]{.mark}**
programs [as **components of**]{.mark} **security
cooperation**]{.underline}.

The purpose of this first chapter is to [**provide definitions** of the
various programs within **security assistance** and [the **broader
area** of **security coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}.

House Armed Services Committee Report 114-102, accompanying
[the]{.underline} National Defense Authorization Act
([NDAA]{.underline}) for Fiscal Year 2016 (H.R.1735), [includes a
provision for us to report on an inventory of DOD **[security
coop]{.mark}eration** programs]{.underline} intended to build partner
security capabilities.3 [**[DOD defines]{.mark}** these programs [as
**including DOD-administered State security assistance**]{.mark}
activities]{.underline}. [According to DOD and State officials, no
sanctioned U.S. government inventory of security cooperation and
security assistance efforts exists]{.underline}.**[4]{.underline}** In
this report, we provide a fiscal year 2016 inventory of DOD security
cooperation and State security assistance efforts that may be used by
the U.S. government to build foreign partners' capacity to address
security-related threats, including each effort's name, description,
associated legal authorities, and agency involvement as required by the
associated authorities. This inventory includes efforts that have
building partner capacity (BPC) to address security-related threats as a
primary goal as well as efforts that may have BPC as an ancillary goal
or effect.

**\[FOOTNOTE 4\]**

**[4]{.underline}** [Various government and nongovernment entities have
compiled lists of security cooperation efforts, including security
assistance efforts administered by]{.underline} the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency ([DSCA]{.underline}), [but **none of the lists** are
sanctioned by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy as
both **current** and **complete**]{.underline}.

**\[/FOOTNOTE 4\]**

[To develop an inventory of]{.underline} BPC **[security
cooperation]{.underline}** and security assistance [efforts, we reviewed
data, documents, and reports from DOD, State, RAND, and the
Congressional Research Service (CRS); conducted searches of laws; and
reviewed prior GAO reports. We interviewed DOD, State, RAND, and CRS
officials about their research on, and listings of, security
cooperation]{.underline} and security assistance [efforts]{.underline}
used for BPC [and the efforts' associated authorities; the methodologies
they used; and the limitations they encountered]{.underline}. The
efforts we selected for our inventory comprise what our sources referred
to as "programs," "subprograms," "tools," "funding accounts,"
"authorities," or "activities." We used "efforts" as the most inclusive
possible term, because the DOD and DOD-sponsored sources we consulted
used undefined and varying terminology---for example, sometimes using
terms such as "programs" and "activities" interchangeably and sometimes
including funds and the names of authorities---and because these sources
and [DOD officials did not provide DOD-sanctioned definitions of the
program and subprogram levels for security cooperation
programs]{.underline}. We broadly defined building partner capacity to
include efforts that were intended solely to build partner security
capacity as well as those that could have a partial or ancillary effect
on partner security capacity. For example, [we **included** **military
exercises**, **training**, and **equipment** as well as]{.underline}
BPC-related [**personnel exchanges** and **military
contacts**]{.underline}. [To focus our inventory on]{.underline} BPC
efforts to address [**security**-related threats, we **excluded**
efforts whose sole purpose was **humanitarian**, **health**,
**disaster**, or **development** assistance]{.underline}. To eliminate
duplicative and expired efforts, we compared the data we obtained from
these sources and reviewed associated authorities. We worked with DOD
and State officials to resolve any discrepancies, to add additional
efforts, and to group subefforts with overall efforts when the officials
made such information available. See enclosure I for further information
about our objective, scope, and methodology.

We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to March 2017 in
accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.

"Concurrence" vs. "Coordination." [[The **reality** of the **shift in
authorities** is **more complex** than a **simple erosion**]{.mark} of
State's traditional authority]{.underline}. The 1206 authority did
provide Defense with a "train and equip" [authority that had previously
been a State responsibility]{.underline} under Title 22, but the 1206
authority [did, as does]{.underline} the 2282 [authority now, require
State "concurrence" with the Defense-developed plan]{.underline}. [So
[while]{.mark} the responsibility for the planning and programming [has
shifted to Defense, **State**]{.mark} also **[has a
veto]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[In practice, this is **not profoundly
different** than a **State**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Title 22)
[**[authority]{.mark}**, such as FMS or IMET, which is **[implemented by
DoD]{.mark}** through DSCA]{.underline}. [Previously, many DoD
authorities had required either "coordination" or "consultation" with
the State Department, which constituted a relatively weak requirement in
practice, as those terms are poorly defined and could mean as little as
a phone call notification]{.underline}. [Concurrence, on the other hand,
is a relatively formal requirement usually requiring written
documentation. And [the trend is toward]{.mark} joint, or
"[concurrence]{.mark}" authorities, [where **State has a stronger

/GoGreen!

The issue of [[**militarization** of **fo**]{.mark}reign
**[po]{.mark}**licy [is]{.mark} a common theme]{.underline}. One of the
New York Times 100 notable books of 2016 was Rosa Brooks How Everything
became War and the Military Became Everything. In the spring of 2016
Georgetown University Press published a collection of essays entitled
Mission Creep designed to explore the Militarization of US Foreign
Policy. As far back as 2003 Dana Priest, a journalist for the Washington
Post, wrote a book entitled The Mission which asserted that American
diplomacy was being outgunned by the military and that the United States
was becoming increasingly dependent on the military to manage its role
in world affairs. She claimed that "on (president Bill) Clinton's watch
the military slowly, without public scrutiny or debate came to surpass
its civilian leaders in resources and influence around the world".
Specifically she identified the regional combatant commanders. (In
Europe the Supreme Allied Commander Europe---SACEUR) as sources of
increasing diplomatic influence. In the introduction to her book she
assets that "U.S. leaders have been turning more and more to the
military to solve problems that are often, at their root, political and
economic." This shift she argues "has been going on for more than a
decade without much public discussion or debate." Ms. Priest describes a
world in which four star generals and admirals fly around the world in
large jet aircraft, accompanied by substantial staffs to engage in
diplomatic contacts not just with ministers of defense and force
commanders but with heads of state and government as well. She asserts
that they were eclipsing the role of hapless Ambassadors who lacked both
resources and access.

It was and is still true that the Combatant Commanders have at their
disposal substantial resources. They can offer foreign governments
materiel, training and in some cases development assistance. They are
also a remarkably well-educated and impressive group. Many have doctoral
degrees. All have over thirty years of military service. They are not
amateurs. In comparison, successive administrations of both political
parties have regarded diplomacy as an amateur business, reflected in the
fact that about a third of Ambassadors are appointed from outside the
career service, often to key posts. In this new Trump administration,
politicians or business friends of the President have already been
appointed to Moscow, Tokyo, Beijing and London, continuing a practice
which goes back across the last five or six presidencies. Even more
disturbing from a career Foreign Service point of view is the
Administration's decision to appoint a non-career Director General of
the Foreign Service, for the first time in the Department's history.

For all that, Ms. Priest [may have **[overstated]{.mark}** her case.
From **[interviews]{.mark}**]{.underline} which I and my colleague Dr.
Shoon Murray carried out last year [[with]{.mark} over 20 recently
retired **[ambassadors]{.mark} from all corners of the globe**, we found
that almost **[all]{.mark}** said they **[welcomed]{.mark}** these
**[military resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They [did **not**]{.mark}
feel that the occasional high visibility visits of combatant commanders
**[undermine]{.mark}d** [their **authority** or **access** to]{.mark}
the key players in [the **host**]{.mark} **government**]{.underline}.
They saw local officials on a regular, even daily basis, while the
combatant commander would come through the capital city once or twice a
year. Indeed, they saw these generals and admirals as allies in a common
cause. One general went so far as to require his senior staff to wear
buttons which proclaimed "One Team, One Fight" to ensure the
complementarity of the military and diplomatic roles. [There were, to be
sure, **[tensions]{.mark}**, but they [arose]{.mark} largely [from
**personal friction**]{.mark} between the Ambassador and the Combatant
Commander about style and **[not]{.mark}** over issues of regional or
bilateral **[policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Nonetheless for at least 15 years **policy analysts** have been
**asserting** that this growth in military power and influence has
**harmed** American **fo**reign **po**licy. It is **currently
fashionable** to say that **if your only policy tool is a hammer, every
problem becomes a nail**. **Critics**]{.underline} of the status quo
[**assert** that the]{.underline} increasingly capable and well-funded
[military has become the **instrument of choice**]{.underline} when
action has to be taken [to deal with any crisis anywhere in the
world]{.underline}.

[What is certainly true is that the military and its parent the
Department of Defense have enjoyed resources far in excess of what the
State Department enjoys]{.underline}. Ten times as much in fact. [With
resources comes capability]{.underline}. Although in recent years the
Defense Department budget has been constrained, it has always been
vastly greater than the budget of the civilian foreign affairs agencies
including the State Department, the Agency for International
Development, The Voice of America and others. The current administration
intends to substantially increase funding for the military and to give
it even greater capabilities to respond to looming crises in North
Korea, Iran, Ukraine and the Middle East, to name only a few of the
front burner crisis situations that are engrossing the attention of
President Trump and his team. The military will get more hardware. Our
nuclear capabilities will be substantially modernized.

[At the same time Diplomacy is being marginalized]{.underline}. The
State Department and American Diplomacy face radical reorganization and
resource shortages, both in budgetary and human terms, which will surely
mean dislocations and in the short term loss of operational
effectiveness. In addition, The Trump administration has proposed a
thirty percent cut in its budget. Foreign assistance is to be greatly
reduced and USAID potentially abolished or folded into the State
Department. In terms of personnel over one hundred of our most senior
officers, both men and women have gone into retirement and several
hundred more are being offered buyouts to persuade them to take early
retirement. This hollowing out of the diplomatic capabilities of the
United States can will not bring us closer to peace or a resolution of
any of the most important crises which we face. Diplomacy, by its very
nature, involves using the skills of imagination, information and
engagement to create win-win solutions for all the participants. All of
this requires training and years of experience in the field. For the
military the outcome usually must be one-sided; victory for us, defeat
for them.

What has all this meant in practical terms in terms of the Washington
policy debate?

The Trump administration and to a large extent the Republican Party
regard the eight years of the Obama administration as one in which
America failed to exert its traditional leadership role. They were
horrified when Obama was quoted during the Libyan crisis as saying that
America would lead from behind; that is, behind our European allies.
They criticized his decision to pull combat troops out of Iraq as
premature and were critical when he seemed poised to do the same in
Afghanistan. These were not trivial concerns. [The **State** Department
was **seen** to be the **agent of a 'spineless' fo**reign **po**licy,
always ready to **compromise even at the expense of vital American
interests**]{.underline}. Republicans saw the nuclear agreement with
Iran as proof that diplomacy was an inadequate first line of defense for
the United States. The State Department and its political allies in the
Democratic party repeatedly called for greater use of diplomatic and
soft power tools to advance American national interests.

The result is that for a substantial number of American voters the
Democrats were seen as the party of weakness and withdrawal. President
Trump's call to "Make America Great Again" is a reflection of this view.
His slogan also implies that for America to regain its traditional
leadership role it will have to demonstrate that it has a more muscular
foreign policy. The military will be needed as never before.

At the National Security Council, where foreign and security policies
are coordinated and policy papers prepared for the President, the first
of Trump's national security advisors went out of his way to recruit
active duty military officers to fill many of the key positions. He made
it clear that what the President wanted was a policy staff with real
world experience of war, who understood the importance and uses of hard
power and who were capable of keeping at bay the limp-wristed forces of
compromise of the State Department's diplomats. It seemed that soft
power was out and hard power in.

In all fairness it should be noted that the Democrats were not always
champions of the Foreign Service. The numbers of political appointees to
ambassadorial positions reached a record high towards the end of the
Obama administration. The appointment of political appointees in the
Department went down five or six levels in the bureaucracy in order to
assure that the president's priorities would be carried out. If
Republicans tended to think that diplomats were limp-wristed and
liberal, the Democrats often saw them as doctrinaire conservatives
unwilling to move with the liberal currents of the time.

Ironically one of the greatest defenders of the Foreign Service was the
last general to be Secretary of State, Colin Powell. He pushed through a
diplomatic readiness initiative which substantially increased the number
of Foreign Service Officers and for the first time created a 'float'
that enabled more officer to receive training.

The overall situation, however, is not so clear. Two of America's most
distinguished diplomats Ryan Crocker and Nicholas Burns recently drew
attention to the hollowing out of American diplomacy in an article
earlier this week in the New York times. They pointed out that "the
United States is facing an extraordinary set of national security
challenges. While we count on our military ultimately to defend the
country, our diplomats are with it on front lines and in dangerous
places around the world. They are our lead negotiators as we work with
our European allies in NATO to contain growing Russian power on the
Continent. They are our lead negotiators seeking a peaceful end to the
wars in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Our diplomats are assembling the
coalition of countries in East Asia to counter the irresponsible regime
of the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un."

They are almost certainly right.

The traditional view of decision-making is that civilians do policy
creation and definition and to a large extent carry it out. Only in
extreme situation is the military called in to execute the policy. But
what happens when both the Secretary of Defense, traditionally a
civilian, and the national Security Advisor are both military men. The
danger is clearly that military values and capabilities will come to
dominate [the policy [debate]{.mark}]{.underline}. This arrangement
[seems to **[imply]{.mark}** that **[military]{.mark}**]{.underline} men
[[will **seek military solutions**]{.mark} to problems that **need
diplomatic solutions**]{.underline}.

[[**However**, **many experts** point out]{.mark} that the military
worldview is essentially conservative]{.underline}. Historically
presidents have found it hard to persuade the military to take action.
[All too often the Pentagon raises issues of resources, timing,
capabilities and emphasizes the difficulty of taking action rather than
the desirability of rushing to engage]{.underline}. They will do what
they are told to do, but [they [are]{.mark} surprisingly **[risk
averse]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The lessons of Vietnam, Iraq and
Afghanistan have not been lost on them. [They shy away from options that
require boots on the ground]{.underline}. Hence the paralysis of
American policy in Syria.

Pulling in the opposite direction is the revolution in military
capabilities and the more frequent use of remote technologies which put
few American lives at risk. Stand-off weapons facilitated by satellite
or drone control seem relatively safe and often are recommended to the
President as appropriate means of punishing international malefactors
and terrorists. These [**[rapidly evolving tech]{.mark}**nologies
probably [**contribute more** to]{.mark} the **[militarization]{.mark}**
of American **fo**reign **po**licy [than]{.mark} the question of
[whether those **in charge** wear **uniforms**]{.mark} **or
not**]{.underline}. President Trump's use of cruise missiles again a
single airfield in Syria was a sign of this trend.

The discussion of resources is, in fact, complex. The military
establishment frequently complains that it lacks the resources, whether
in terms of manpower or equipment to fulfill the many tasks which the
President wants it to carry out, particularly when the time frame for
action is short. Military doctrine calls for the capability to fight two
major wars simultaneously. That, of course, requires an ability to
deploy an extraordinary range of land, sea and air forces. That well may
be beyond the current capabilities of U.S. forces.

Yet civilians and diplomats, ambassadors in particular, also complain
bitterly about the dramatic shortage of resources available for
diplomacy. The dramatic decline in morale in the State Department
reflects the perception that the political elite does not value
diplomatic skills or the expertise which diplomats bring to the table.
One recently retired senior Foreign Service Officer told a group several
weeks ago that the atmosphere inside the State Department was one of
"chaos and fear". Hiring freezes, budget cuts, politicization of the
senior policy levels in the State Department all point to this decline
in respect for the core skills of diplomacy. Diplomats are, as I have
indicated, too often seen as politically biased and, in the present
context viscerally hostile to the President. The fact that last year
over one hundred retired Ambassadors signed a letter calling on the
American people to vote against President Trump only deepened the
perception of potential disloyalty. Several recent dissent memoranda
about the withdrawal from the Paris climate accords and of the failure
to list Burma, Iraq and Afghanistan on the list of countries employing
child soldiers have further fueled the distrust of the Foreign Service.

Nonetheless the senior military leadership and the top civilians at the
Pentagon continue to be outspoken in their support for more resources
for the State Department. They, unlike their political leaders, see
diplomacy as the first line of defense. The military knows that it will
be called in only when diplomacy has failed.

In sum, [[we are **not** facing]{.mark} a **[militarization]{.mark}** of
American **fo**reign **po**licy [but the **marginalization of
diplomacy**]{.mark} as the effective alternative to military
force]{.underline}. The [denigration and dismissal of soft
power]{.underline}, even when it is renamed smart power, [has led to a
**perception** of **diplomatic weakness** and the **concomitant rise of
military influence** on the policy process]{.underline}. It is a sad
reality that there are more and more hammers in the policy toolbox and
fewer alternative weapons. The result may be that a president anxious to
make America great again and to demonstrate the effectiveness of
American leadership and power may look for a place of his choosing to
demonstrate American power. President Trump does not seem
temperamentally interested in the prolonged and protracted process of
diplomacy. His recent tweet questioning the utility of Secretary
Tillerson's efforts to engage the North Koreans in dialogue is an
example of this skepticism. In these circumstances we should not be
surprised if the United States were to decide to choose a target of
opportunity in Iran or North Korea or Syria to show off its military
might. This will not reflect the institutional militarization of
American foreign policy but rather the emotional need of many Americans,
frustrated by our loss of global standing to demonstrate that America
can indeed be great again. Neither a resourced military nor a
marginalized diplomacy should want that to happen.

**Morton 18** Christopher A. Morton, Major, United States Marine Corps,
MA candidate, Security Studies, Naval Postgraduate School, BSBA, Ohio
State University, "How Does United States Security Assistance Affect
Host Nation Democratization?" MA thesis, June 2018,
<https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1060022.pdf> /GoGreen!

This thesis asked the question: How does United States security
assistance affect host nation democratization in U.S. Central Command's
area of responsibility? Does it support, undermine, or have minimal
effect on host nation democratization? I also investigated what U.S.
security assistance (SA) is typically designed to accomplish, how those
policies came about, and how influential U.S. SA is compared to other
factors. I analyzed evidence from case studies on Lebanon and Pakistan
to find supporting points and counterpoints for the [three main
hypotheses: U.S. SA supports host nation democratization, U.S. SA
undermines host nation democratization, and U.S. SA has minimal
influence on host nation democratization]{.underline} compared to local
and regional actors. [I concluded that United States **[security
assistance has minimal effect on]{.mark} host nation
[democratization]{.mark}**]{.underline} compared to local and regional
actors, [because it is designed and resourced primarily to accomplish
security objectives, not to drive enduring institutional
reform]{.underline}.

[Generally speaking, there is **significantly more support** for the
third hypothesis in the democratization literature]{.underline}. The
case of Lebanon supported the third hypothesis, but it also supported
the "U.S. SA supports host nation democratization" argument to a lesser
degree. The case of Pakistan supported the third hypothesis, but it also
supported the "U.S. SA undermines host nation democratization" argument
to a lesser degree. It is evident that U.S. SA is capable of affecting
host nation governance either positively or negatively, but U.S. SA is
significantly less influential than the host nation's local and regional
actors. This is an important point, because [a common argument
throughout the literature is the belief that U.S. SA is capable of
significantly impacting the host nation's institutions, political
culture, civil society, etc]{.underline}. My view is that [the
[influence]{.mark} of U.S. SA on host nation governance [is]{.mark}
**frequently [over-stated]{.mark}**]{.underline}; but if it was
resourced more heavily and designed to emphasize institutional reform,
then it could better support host nation democratization.

Does U.S. SA support host nation democratization? I argue that U.S. SA
can help prevent democratic backsliding, but it does not actively
support democratization in the way that it is typically designed and
resourced. If the United States supported host nation democratization
via its inspirational democratic example (e.g., protecting human rights
and individual liberties), then U.S. SA was not the conduit for
broadcasting the U.S. democratic example. The evidence showed that two
spikes in U.S. SA (between 0.8% and 1.4% of host nation GDP) were
quickly followed by increases in democratization, but the largest spike
in U.S. SA (upwards of 1.52% of host nation GDP, and conditioned on
democracy-related reforms) did not increase democratization. 590 If aid
conditionality supports host nation democratization, then the case
studies indicate that the threshold is between 0.25% and 0.60% of host
nation GDP.591 The evidence in both cases supported the idea that U.S.
SA reinforced host nation security, which helped prevent state collapse
and democratic backsliding, though it did not increase democratization.
If U.S. security sector assistance generally supports host nation
security sector reform---which then improved its civil-military
relations and democratic governance---then the case studies indicated
the threshold is above 10.5% of annual U.S. SA to the host nation.592
Overall, the cases provided little evidence to support this argument and
plenty of evidence to undermine it.

Does U.S. SA undermine host nation democratization? I argue that U.S. SA
does not undermine democratization as it is currently designed and
resourced, but it could have an anti-democratic influence under the same
design with excessive funding. Does U.S. SA to oppressive
authoritarians' security apparatuses undermine democratization? The case
of Pakistan revealed two increases in democracy shortly after large
spikes in U.S. SA given to military dictators, and both of those SA
packages lacked democratic conditionality.593 If this mechanism is
generalizable, then the activation threshold is above 0.85% of host
nation GDP.594 Pakistan's positive public opinion of U.S. personal
freedoms in the 2000s undermined the argument that a bad U.S. democratic
example deters host nation democratization.595 Both cases undermined the
argument that Western foreign policy created a resistance toward Western
liberal democracy. Both gave ample evidence of domestic and regional
factors that can explain different forms of host nation democracy. I
found no evidence that either country feared a Western-sponsored
democratic revolution.

[The most compelling causal mechanism was that U.S. SA (especially when
it lacks democratic conditionality) creates an aid dependency dynamic.
If U.S. SA reinforces a rentier class in the host nation society, then
it likely undermined democracy]{.underline}. Before 2008, U.S. SA to
Pakistan was below 6.14% and was followed by democratization. 596 After
the 2008 increase in democracy, Pakistan's Freedom House rating stayed
at 4.5 through 2017; and from 2010--2014, U.S. SA averaged 7.37% of
Pakistan's government revenue. 597 This causal mechanism may activate
when U.S. SA is above 6.14% of host nation government revenue, but that
assumes that Pakistan has a notable rentier dynamic. If Pakistan does
have a rentier dynamic, then U.S. SA was a notable contributor to it. I
found that Pakistan's military economy predated U.S. SA, and so U.S. SA
may have entrenched it slightly, but it did not alter the fundamental
dynamic of state governance. In short, U.S. SA and other aid sources
were insufficient to create a rentier dynamic that did not already
exist.

I argue that U.S. SA has minimal influence on host nation
democratization compared to domestic and regional actors. It is designed
to accomplish U.S. security objectives. [The programs capable of driving
institutional reform are a meager share of overall U.S. SA. U.S. SA is
rarely integrated with a whole-of-government effort for supporting host
nation democratization, and when one could argue it is, the quantity and
duration of funding is inadequate to supersede the influence of domestic
and regional actors]{.underline}. When the host nation's security
interests diverge from those of the United States (e.g., post-9/11
Pakistan), the resulting agency loss increases the threshold of U.S. SA
necessary to have a significant influence. Despite the stated theme of
democracy promotion in U.S. policy documents, U.S. SA was primarily
designed to accomplish security objectives. By design it was not able to
compete with domestic and regional actors, and by quantity it is not
enough to significantly influence host nation democratization.

B. POLICY IMPLICATIONS

The United States can pursue its security objectives and democratization
agenda somewhat independently in accordance with its typical design and
resourcing of U.S. SA. [There is a continual **debate** in U.S. foreign
policy circles regarding whether or not to use **aid conditionality** to
**incentivize democratization** or to allow U.S. SA to focus solely on
security objectives without constraints relating to host nation
governance]{.underline}.598 [I found [**no evidence** that
**democracy-related aid conditionality** on]{.mark} "traditional" forms
of U.S. [**SA** **influenced host nation
democratization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which means that such
conditionality should be applied for other purposes (e.g., to satisfy
U.S. legal requirement or political sensitivities).

[If the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [wants to decisively
support host nation democratization, then U.S. SA should go to
recipients with good democratic prospects in sufficient quantity for
adequate duration. U.S. [SA **would need to be**]{.mark} **designed as
[part of a whole-of-government]{.mark} support [package]{.mark} and
[implemented for a generation or more]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It [would
**need to exceed 1.5**]{.mark}**2[%]{.mark} [of host]{.mark} nation
[GDP]{.mark}** and increasingly emphasize defense institution building
programs and other programs that bolster host nation civil-military
relations]{.underline}. 599 [[**Anything less** is **unlikely** to
support]{.mark} host nation **[democratization]{.mark}**
decisively]{.underline}. How would a head of state decide where to
commit its resources to promote democracy if it cannot afford to take
this approach worldwide? I concur with Ottaway that there are two basic
choices. The United States can lower its democracy promotion policy
ambitions and settle for sub-standard democracies, or it can abandon
some countries in which democratic prospects are particularly dim and
focus its resources on countries that are more likely to democratize.600
U.S. SA would go to states that largely share U.S. security interests
(which reduces agency loss); have a high GDP, a history of democracy,
and some form of civil society (which supports democratic
consolidation); have neighboring democratic examples; have host nation
elites willing to democratize; and have the institutional capacity to
absorb the assistance.

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall we have [seen]{.underline} a steady
outpouring of books and [articles lamenting the trend]{.underline} in
Washington [to see foreign policy through a military lens]{.underline}:
Rosa Brooks' How Everything Became War and the Military Became
Everything, Lorelei Kelly's Unbalanced Security: The Divide between
State and Defense, and Gordon Adams and Shoon Murray's Mission
Creep---The Militarization of U.S. Foreign Policy, among others.

Why might one have this view? Is it that the [**Defense** Department's
huge **budget**, **personnel** and other **capabilities** give it an
**advantage**]{.underline}? Is it due to how the military is
organized---with [geographic combatant commands]{.underline} that [have
**effective control** over policy and activities across their areas of
responsibility, whereas **[State's]{.mark} regional bureaus** are
**misaligned** with military counterparts and assistant secretaries deal
via **turf-conscious** bilateral ambassadors]{.underline} numbering up
to 40 or more, and have little say over how USAID spends its money?

Has [Foggy Bottom **[lost relevance]{.mark}** in the foreign affairs
arena [by emphasizing **soft-power social agendas**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., the creation of special envoys for various religions, LGBTQ, the
Holocaust, global youth and global women's affairs) that are distinctly
American [over hard-power national security interests]{.underline}
(e.g., strong international security and healthy economic systems that
protect allies and provide opportunities for American businesses)? Or is
it, perhaps, simply that the Foreign Service is either late in arriving
or missing from the field where the military is operating?

The answer, [of course]{.underline}, is **[all of the
above]{.underline}**. But there are two broad aspects of the problem
that I believe are fundamental: first, the proliferation of priorities
at the State Department following the end of the Cold War; and second,
the missed opportunities at State during the past 20 years of joint
operations with the military to institutionalize the kind of
professional and personal relationships that would enable the smaller
Foreign Service to exert leadership in the foreign policy arena at home
and abroad.

A Proliferation of Priorities

The end of the Cold War and the so-called "end of history" marked a
shift for the State Department. We hired a more diverse Foreign Service
that, in turn, took on a broader range of narrower activities that more
resemble small-picture social engineering than traditional, big-picture
diplomacy. At the same time, [State reallocated existing resources to
create an alphabet soup of new under secretaries, functional bureaus,
offices and special envoys]{.underline}. At its peak during the Obama
administration, there were [more than 50]{.underline} of the latter. As
Ambassador Jim Jeffrey observes in a March 3 piece in Foreign Policy,
neither the 2010 nor the 2015 Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development
Review focuses on "traditional" diplomacy. [The department has
[**diffused its energy too broadly** to the **neglect of
fundamentals**]{.mark}, and [this]{.mark}, in turn, **[left a
vacuum]{.mark}** that [the **military has had to
fill**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

New State Department priorities include such things as this, for
example. In Muslim-majority Indonesia in 2014 and 2015, not long before
the deadly January 2016 extremist terrorist attack on Starbucks and
other locations rocked the capital, Jakarta, our consulate in Surabaya
produced impressive Hispanic heritage month YouTube videos of its
celebrations, which included spending money to bring Los Angeles artists
to paint murals on the walls of a local school and sponsor fun runs for
local girls. Similarly, in March the U.S. embassy in Macedonia---a
country with simmering interethnic tensions and endemic corruption that
hasn't had a government since elections in early December 2016---flew in
a lawyer from the Office of the Special Counsel to lecture locals on the
Hatch Act, even as refugees streamed north from Greece and European-born
Islamic State group fighters returned from Syrian battlefields.

A solely military response is not sufficient. We want to increasingly
involve other elements of the U.S. government and the international
community, recognizing that it is only through a combination of
capabilities that we will achieve and sustain our strongest deterrence
posture.

In religiously conservative Uganda, a U.S. Army commander there to train
units in combating the Lord's Resistance Army and al-Shabaab in Somalia
had to deal with backlash from an angry counterpart when the U.S.
embassy flew the rainbow flag high over Kampala in a righteous response
to that country's persecution of the LGBTQ community. That subsequently
set back efforts to combat other forms of violent abuses of human rights
in eastern Africa.

One general commented, "If everything is a priority for the State
Department, nothing is."

[On its own, each example represents admirable [commitment]{.mark} by

\*added \[overlooked\]

With dozens of treaty allies and a strategic priority of promoting the
sovereignty of weak states, [the U.S. **[military]{.mark}** has been
gradually **[shifting]{.mark}** from a force designed for confrontation
[to]{.mark} one intended to promote international
**cooperation**]{.underline}. To be sure, the U.S. military retains a
technical and doctrinal advantage as a warfighting entity. However, over
the past two decades, the military has been incorporating new
organizations, doctrine, and training to prioritize efforts to prevent
war [through **[security]{.mark} force
[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has shifted focus to weak
states where sub-national (e.g., gangs in Central America) and
trans-national security challenges (e.g., al-Qa'ida) jeopardize
sovereignty and regional stability.1 Consequently, countries such as the
Philippines, Georgia, Colombia, Uganda, and Pakistan have requested
security assistance from the United States. While level of support
varies, U.S. forces are enabling partner countries to combat challenges
that threaten their own stability.

[This shift in focus has **raised concerns** about the
"**militarization** of U.S. **fo**reign **po**licy,"]{.underline} which
began in the 1990s with the recognition that combatant commanders are as
much policy entrepreneurs as they are war fighters.2 Generals like Tony
Zinni or Wesley Clark epitomized the new breed of warrior-diplomat who
directly engaged with foreign heads of state.3 Far from rogue generals,
these military leaders were directed by President Bill Clinton to engage
with the world and promote security by assisting partners and assuring
allies in a security environment freed from the Cold War dynamic.
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama continued the
practice of using the military to assist almost every government of the
world. As Administrations from both parties came to value the military's
capabilities in peace and war, [some contended that defense overshadowed
(if not displaced) traditional diplomacy and development
efforts]{.underline}.4 Within defense circles, [critics assumed that
helping weak states **jeopardized** American **military dominance** and
**undercut preparations for major war**]{.underline}.5 More recently,
[critics highlight that in an era of declining budgets, the]{.underline}
United States [military cannot afford nor overcome **unintended
consequences** of attempting to be a "global force for
good."]{.underline}6 These are valid concerns, **[but]{.underline}** the
United States shows no signs of retreating from a global leadership role
and instead seeks partnerships as a key component of U.S. strategy.

With shared challenges of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and
shared goals of development and protecting human security, there are
unprecedented levels of international cooperation to share information,
target terrorists, and provide governments the tools they need to
confront national threats before they become regional ones. This is on
display in Afghanistan where 50 countries operate under the ISAF flag,
or in the Indian Ocean where 27 countries operate as Combined Maritime
Forces. At the center of the coalitions is a U.S.-sponsored framework to
enable partners to contribute to international security.

President Barack Obama intends to continue the American tradition of
enabling partners throughout the globe. As he noted in his second
inaugural address, "America will remain the anchor of strong alliances
in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that
extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. For no one has a greater
stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation." [By training
and equipping other militaries, the goal is to **reduce** U.S. American
**military presence internationally** and]{.underline} allow others to
provide for their own security. [This has **positive
benefits**]{.underline} not only for the U.S. defense budget (e.g., an
Afghan soldier costs hundreds per month compared to an American soldier
who costs thousands per month), but also [for **international
security**]{.underline}. While my earlier book Exporting Security
explains why the United States assists governments from Afghanistan to
Zambia, an overlooked area is security assistance provided to developed
countries.

CAPACITY MATTERS

As France recently learned in Mali, while it has capable ground forces
and aircraft, it has limited ability to sustain these forces just 2,000
miles from home. To support its foreign policy agenda, France needed the
United States Air Force to fly its forces and refuel its attack
aircraft. As the operation continues, the United States will probably
provide intelligence for French and African forces as they shift to
stability operations.

Counterterrorism can certainly explain U.S. intervention in Mali;
however, enabling French success explains the timeline. More
importantly, the case of U.S.-supported French intervention in Mali is
illustrative of the role the United States plays in supporting developed
countries. France is the latest developed country to need U.S.
assistance, but requests like this are common. This is true for almost
every one of the 50 countries serving in Afghanistan today, as it was
true with European countries in the Balkans, Australian forces in East
Timor, and British forces in West Africa. These examples highlight that
the foreign policy goals of many developed countries exceed their
military capacity, which requires them to rely on the U.S. military for
assistance. As developed countries' defense budgets fall further,
reliance on the United States is going to increase. This remains a
decades-old frustration. Most recently, the NATO Secretary General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, "There is a lower limit on how little we can
spend on defense, while living up to our responsibilities.\"7

Pragmatically, the United States would like its partners to do more, but
shared challenges and limited budgets will reinforce the value of
American logistics, combat experience, and intelligence capacity.
Further, American support of other countries reinforces the treaty
arrangements with 27 NATO countries and five Asian countries. Twenty
years ago, there seemed to be little relevance to these treaties and
security arrangements, let alone a rationale for invoking them or
expanding them. Yet, the opposite occurred. NATO increased its
membership three times from 16 to 19 in 1999, again to 26 in 2006, and
again to 28 in 2009. At the same time the number of NATO members
increased, NATO changed from its traditional mission of territorial
defense to one of global security engagement. With each expansion, new
members require training and equipping to NATO standards. With each new
operation, NATO countries require access to U.S. intelligence, critical
technology, and global logistics.

In addition to formal treaties of alliance, an additional dozen
countries are offered protection under the U.S. security umbrella either
by law, such as the Taiwan Relations Act or by policy such as United
States' support for Israel.8 These protections include provisions to
train and equip their militaries. Another dozen countries are offered
special security provisions through Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status.
MNNA does not confer a mutual defense relationship, but the largely
symbolic act implies a close working relationship with another
country\'s defense forces.9 It is more akin to a preferred buyer's
program allowing countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea access
to advanced weapons systems. With weapons purchases also come long-term
training and maintenance contracts. From a U.S. perspective, it has a
comparative advantage in defense exports; strategically, programs like
these are intended to overcome the free-rider problem the United States
faces with its partners.10 For every Joint Strike Fighter Japan buys,
the United States can deploy one less to northeast Asia.

Given the diplomatic nature of these security partnerships, the
Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs focuses these
activities, regulates the defense trade and arms transfers to reinforce
the military capabilities of friends, allies, and coalition partners,
and ensures that the transfer of U.S.-origin defense equipment and
technology supports U.S. national security interests. Further, the
Bureau promotes regional security through bilateral and multilateral
cooperation and dialogue, as well as through the provision of security
assistance to friendly countries and international peacekeeping efforts.
The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military balances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to Saudi
Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., South Korea), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old FARC insurgency). Historically, Israel has been
the largest recipient of security assistance and its neighbor Egypt
benefited from its recognition of Israel and the Camp David Accords.11
Given its proximity to the United States and challenges with drug
trafficking organizations, Mexico has recently emerged as a top
recipient of security assistance. Given the history of American military
interventions in Mexico, this has required new efforts to build trust to
reassure the government that it seeks to strengthen it and not undermine
it.12

One reason the United States concentrates assistance on just a few
countries is to promote particular countries as regional leaders. In
practice, this means that Jordan hosts an international special
operations exercise, peace operations training center, and an
international police training center. Or in Latin America, Colombia
provides helicopter training for regional militaries and El Salvador
hosts a regional peacekeeping institute, attracting military personnel
from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Given the significant
U.S. investment in Afghanistan's military and police training
infrastructure, it is likely that Afghanistan could eventually host
regional training if the insurgency subsides to acceptable levels. [This
approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also **reduces** the
need for American **presence** and the **negative attention** it
sometimes generates]{.underline}. We see the benefits of this today
where U.S.-trained Colombian pilots are training Mexican pilots in
Colombia.

**\[Table 1: Top Recipients of U.S. International Assistance (Account
150) OMITTED\]**

In addition to the Department of State budget for security assistance,
the [**Defense** Department]{.underline} directly funds security
assistance through section 1206/7 and other command funds such as
Commander's Emergency Response Program. This [**authority** did provoke
more **concern** about **militarizing fo**reign **po**licy;
**[however]{.mark}**, this **[only]{.mark}** makes up]{.underline} about
\$1 billion annually, which is [[**less than 15 percent** of]{.mark}
**security assistance** funded by the **[State]{.mark}** Department.
Further, U.S. **ambassadors must approve all programs**]{.underline}.
Thus, [the Department of **[State]{.mark} exerts considerable
[control]{.mark} of [programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels]{.mark}** through the embassy country team]{.underline}.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE MILITARY

With national security focused on weak states and persistent security
concerns among stable allies like South Korea, the U.S. military has
been changing over the last 20 years from a force of confrontation to
one of cooperation. [The military has learned that partnership is better
than clientism and is adapting its command structure once optimized for
waging major combat to one that is focused on conflict prevention. There
is **still a tremendous warfighting capability** in the U.S. military,
but coalition warfare is the norm and developing compatible warfighting
partners is a key goal of this cooperative strategy]{.underline}. In
some sense, [[this **turns the idea of militarization**]{.mark} **of
fo**reign **po**licy **[on its head]{.mark}**; the [Pentagon is **being
demilitarized**]{.mark} and valued for its ability to impart military
capabilities to U.S. partners]{.underline}.

Given the current structure of the international system and
technological advances, the United States does not need partners in the
same way as it did in the past where they provided direct benefits
through coaling stations, maintenance facilities, or large bases. While
the number of forward bases is still substantial, the number of forward
deployed forces are greatly reduced. More importantly, the nature of the
presence has changed; the United States aspires to create true partners
that can confront their own threats to internal stability (e.g.,
assistance to Colombia's military) or alleviate security dilemmas (e.g.,
future basing in Australia). It also seeks to foster independence by
training and equipping militaries to support the global demand for
peacekeepers.14 The United States certainly gets increased access to
countries around the world through these programs, but given the
overwhelming military dominance of the United States, it does not abuse
these relationships or ignore seemingly insignificant states. Instead,
it seeks to create partners where sovereignty is respected and all
parties derive benefits. The latest example of this is U.S. withdrawal
from Iraq as dictated by a U.S.-Iraqi agreement.

[[While]{.mark} the Defense Department's capacity certainly explains why
international [assistance]{.mark} missions **[increasingly have a
military face]{.mark}**, it is also essential to understand that **there
is a global demand** for U.S. security assistance. The
**[Defense]{.mark}** Department **[has recognized]{.mark} that there are
[limits]{.mark} to what it can do**; the military **[wants]{.mark}** and
needs [**partners** from **across**]{.mark} the **[government]{.mark}**,
[**allies** and **private**]{.mark} **organization[s]{.mark}**.
Unfortunately, these ideas remain]{.underline} stunted
[\[**[overlooked]{.mark}**\] [in the]{.mark} broader foreign [policy
community]{.mark} that gets **[easily overwhelmed by]{.mark} the [size
of]{.mark} the Defense Department's [resources]{.mark}**. For critics,
U.S. military activities in permissive environments bring old memories
of invasion or coup. For them, U.S. foreign policy is on a dangerous
militarization path]{.underline}. While that part of U.S. military
history is real and still resonates in many parts of the world, [[it is
**wrong**]{.mark} to overlook the changes that have occurred over the
last two decades. Further, it is wrong to overlook the significant
demands developed countries place on the United States]{.underline}.

/GoGreen!

[Much has been written on the "militarization" of US foreign
policy]{.underline}. Since 9/11, [the Department of Defense expanded its
non-combat activities into areas normally reserved for traditional
diplomacy]{.underline}. In 2005, it was given a mandate to build
"indigenous capacity for securing essential services, a viable market
economy, rule of law, democratic institutions, and a robust civil
society". While the initial focus was on Iraq and Afghanistan, it
allowed the Department to do the same in other regions.

In 2009, the Department's international mandate broadened to
"strengthening governance and the rule of law and fostering economic
stability and development". Congress added new authorities, most
recently allowing the US military to work with non-military security
forces. The Defense Department now manages a greater portion of security
assistance than the Department of State. The Trump Administration
continues to favor the use of the US military over US diplomacy to
address great-power competition. It has increased the defense budget
while slashing that for diplomacy; for 2020, it requested a 4.9%
increase for the Defense Department and proposed a 21% cut for the State
Department. Today, the Department of Defense plays an important role in
US foreign policy.

This expanded role is visible in Europe. Despite tirades by President
Donald Trump on the value of NATO, and finger-pointing on member
contributions, [US military engagement with NATO]{.underline} and in
Europe [continues]{.underline}, with broad Congressional and public
support. Through the European Deterrence Initiative (EDI), [the US
military has increased its forward presence and exercises with allies
and partners]{.underline}. Through Operation Atlantic Resolve, the US
European Command added US troop rotations across Eastern Europe and
prepositioned equipment. The Defense Department also [boosted training
and assistance]{.underline} for Georgia and Ukraine. The increased US
military presence in Europe was triggered by Russia's invasion of Crimea
and aimed at reassuring allies along Europe's eastern frontier. Today,
it is part of a broader US and NATO deterrence posture vis-à-vis Russia.

The Defense Department has become involved in institution-building in
the region, normally the purview of diplomacy. Examples include
repairing schools, conducting anti-corruption workshops, and law
enforcement training. The gray zone challenges in Europe, especially
cyber and disinformation, are being addressed primarily by the Defense
Department. Whereas the State Department eliminated the office of the
Cyber Coordinator, the Defense Department broadened its networks and now
includes civilian authorities in exercises. [Whereas the State
Department has very little funding to fight Russian disinformation, the
Defense Department is expanding initiatives within EUCOM and [with
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The consequences of the increased militarization of US foreign policy
for transatlantic relations are threefold.

First, [US engagement in Europe appears more militarized]{.underline}.
The addition of US forces and the increased tempo of exercises has meant
that tens of thousands of US troops have moved across Europe visible to
all civilians. A publicity campaign has been waged to highlight this
commitment. New security agreements are being signed and celebrated,
including the new letter on security cooperation between the US, Finland
and Sweden. The increased US pressure on burden sharing, although not
always well received, has meant even more defense discussions.

[In contrast, US diplomatic engagement has decreased]{.underline}.
President Trump's negative rhetoric about Europe, the decision to
withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran Nuclear Agreement
(JCPOA), and friction on issues such as Nord Stream II have disrupted
normal diplomatic discourse. There have been no US-EU Summits since
President Trump took office and subgroups on energy and cyber have not
met in several years.

Secondly, [joint **[efforts to address]{.mark} threats to
[democracy]{.mark}** in the region **[will likely be carried
out]{.mark}** or funded [by]{.mark} the **[Defense]{.mark}** Department.
The State Department simply does not have the resources]{.underline}:
for 2018, its budget for all of Europe and Eurasia was \$1.2 billion.
The budget for EDI alone was \$4.5 billion.

Thirdly, beyond Europe, [**US-European [coop]{.mark}eration** [is **more
likely** to advance in **military rather than**]{.mark} **in [policy
channels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. On China, for example, where
policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic are unable to agree on a
comprehensive approach, defense officials are working together to
address China's new military muscle in forums such as the US France
Indo-Pacific Security Dialogue. In Africa, where US and EU policymakers
have vastly different strategies, military cooperation continues to
fight terrorism, crime and human trafficking.

[The enhanced position of the Defense Department in US foreign policy is
likely to continue]{.underline}. The US military has not sought this
role. Indeed, US military leaders have repeatedly called for restoring
balance between the use of military and diplomatic tools and for funding
the State Department. Despite these appeals, the Trump Administration's
preference for using the US military will further increase the
militarization of US foreign policy.

[For Europe, **leveraging defense ties** can help **balance diplomatic
disconnects** across the transatlantic]{.underline}. While there are
challenges in defense policy, [**[defense relations]{.mark}** may
[prove]{.mark} to be [the **steadier foundation for transatlantic
coop**]{.mark}**eration** in the near future]{.underline}.

The Price of Unity

Admittedly, [pursuing a tougher course of action on values and
principles comes with risks]{.underline}. [**[Even measured
steps]{.mark}** could **[create serious rifts]{.mark}** among allies,
with the potential of]{.underline} paralyzing **[\[[freezing]{.mark}\]
[the alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Because NATO operates by
consensus, any punitive action on an ally could provoke retaliatory
action on other NATO business. In reaction to Norway's stark criticisms
against the Portuguese and Greek regimes at a June 1971 foreign
ministers meeting, then-NATO Secretary General Manlio Brosio warned that
"if we undermine our solidarity, we run the risk of undermining the
substance of our alliance."

Overcoming this dilemma between prioritizing values and preserving unity
requires a graduated, collective, and dispassionate approach. First,
NATO will need to be proportionate when dealing with an ally violating
trans-Atlantic values. Allies should start with discussions behind
closed doors rather than publicize the dispute. Open and frank dialogue
among allies should always be the first step before adopting restrictive
measures. [[If]{.mark} NATO [moves **too quickly**]{.mark} **or
aggressively**, it risks being [**counterproductive** by **widening
divisions**]{.mark} in the alliance]{.underline}. At the end of the day,
this progressive approach should have a deterrent effect on NATO
countries, especially on those that value their membership in the
alliance and do not want to be singled out as "bad allies."

Second, NATO's response should be as collective and resolute as
possible. [**[If pressure is applied by only a few]{.mark} NATO
[countries]{.mark}**, [the ally]{.mark} in question may **[not
take]{.mark} the warning [seriously]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} could
**[use]{.mark} the [divisions]{.mark} among allies [to avoid
accountability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If enough allies agree to lean on
a problematic NATO country, then accepting short-term disunity for the
sake of preserving trans-Atlantic values could be worth it. In 2019,
Turkey ultimately decided to lift its longstanding veto to the defense
plans of Poland and the Baltic states because it was facing a growing
and consistent pressure from numerous allies, including the United
States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. The unity of the
members of the Quad was critical in that case and changed Ankara's
strategic calculus.

Last but not least, all allies must be subject to the same objective
criteria and scrutiny. Otherwise, [the backsliding ally [will]{.mark}
simply [**claim it is being singled out** and **dismiss**]{.mark} **the
charges**]{.underline}. The International Secretariat can be helpful
here by conducting an impartial, evenhanded assessment. Strong
involvement of NATO's secretary general will also be key in preserving
political cohesion through this thorny process. Recently, Secretary
General Stoltenberg played an instrumental role in easing the tensions
between Greece and Turkey through the establishment of a bilateral
de-confliction mechanism in which he did not assess blame but merely
facilitated dialogue to be informed by international rules and norms.

There are many good reasons to host such a gathering. It's smart
politics, fulfills a campaign commitment and counters the perception,
fostered by President Donald Trump, that America is no longer interested
in promoting democracy and human rights. But as a geopolitical
instrument, [**drawing lines between democracies and autocracies** is
not only **certain to disappoint** --- it's also a deeply flawed
organizing principle for America's approach to the world]{.underline}.

China and Russia, which Biden has also singled out for criticism, are
not the main causes of the weakening of democracies around the world.
Most of the backsliding, according to a recent study, has been caused by
erosion within the world's democracies, including the United States and
many of its allies. Indeed, the upcoming summit includes a number of
countries --- India, Brazil, the Philippines and Poland among them ---
marked by growing autocratic movements and infringements on freedom of
expression and a free press. And **[[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these and [**[other countries to reform]{.mark}** their political,
electoral or judicial institutions [**from the outside** is]{.mark} hard
if not **[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Biden isn't the first and won't be the last American president to make
democracy promotion central to his foreign policy. Woodrow Wilson wanted
to make the world "safe for democracy"; Franklin Roosevelt promulgated
the Atlantic Charter. The Clinton administration was present at the
creation of the Community of Democracies. George W. Bush had his Freedom
Agenda and talked about ridding the world of dictators. All found
democracy promotion a useful tool to advance U.S. values and interests.

Biden seems to genuinely believe that democrats and dictators are in a
do-or-die battle over who will own the 21st century. Though he insists
that he doesn't want a new cold war, some of his overcharged rhetoric
belies this view. In March, Biden announced his intention "to invite an
alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future," including
holding "China accountable to follow the rules" on issues such as
persecution of its Uyghur citizens and its territorial disputes with
Taiwan. Biden has said of China's President Xi Jinping that he "doesn't
have a democratic bone . . . in his body" and that Xi believes
"democracy cannot keep up with" China.

It is simplistic to believe, however, that Chinese and Russian foreign
policies are driven by the ideological impulse to spread autocracy. Both
countries see the United States as their main geopolitical adversary and
seek to undermine American influence and alliances wherever they can;
the Chinese are also bent on outcompeting the United States in
21st-century technologies.

But the Russians don't have an authoritarian model for export, and other
autocratic-minded governments don't need inspiration from Moscow to run
kleptocratic, corrupt, repressive and misgoverned regimes. Putin's
overriding priority is self-preservation and the preservation of his
regime. What evidence is there that he believes these objectives can be
achieved only if the rest of the world looks like Russia?

Likewise, Xi's main priority is maintaining his control and the Chinese
Communist Party's monopoly on power. He is all too happy to claim that
the Chinese government is outperforming America's dysfunctional system.
But it is simply not the case that he thinks these goals require Beijing
to actively spread authoritarianism with Chinese characteristics abroad.
And China's wealth and power, not to mention its social stability,
depend on competing effectively within the interdependent global
economic system, not toppling it.

[[Another **flaw**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Biden administration's
approach [[is the **presumption that all democracies think
alike**]{.mark} based on their shared commitment to democratic
values]{.underline}. If only it were that simple. [Values do shape a
nation's foreign policy, but history, geography, culture, political
ideology and material interests also matter]{.underline}. [It is
[**precisely for these reasons** that]{.mark} America's **[democratic
allies]{.mark}** and partners **[do not see eye to eye]{.mark}** on how
to deal with China or Russia --- and why they shouldn't be forced to
choose sides between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
the authoritarians]{.underline}.

Ch. 3\]

This finding or 'law' has not only been recognized by scholars of
international relations, but also found its way outside academia and has
influenced foreign policies to promote peace and democracy, most
prominently since the 1990s. However, [my book will not]{.underline}
draw conclusions based on '**[cherry-pick]{.underline}**ing' of specific
studies showing how peaceful democracies are, but on a systematic
overview of studies in this field. Therefore, [this book relies on **my
own database** with **[hundreds of]{.mark} different
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are relevant for each chapter;
the articles had to engage directly with the chapter's main research
question. The next section will provide more detailed information around
the selection criteria. This overview includes both highly cited and
recent articles which were selected in a systematic way.

Based on analyses of statistical studies around this topic of democracy
and war, it will become clear that the overall statistical support for
the democratic peace hypothesis is not strong at all. In the rest of the
chapter, I will spell out four reasons why [democracy does **not cause
peace**]{.underline}, and why [the **empirical [support]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} the popular idea of [democratic [peace]{.mark} is
**quite [weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}: (1) most [studies do [no]{.mark}t
find a **strong [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between democracy
and interstate war [[at]{.mark} the **[dyadic
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [they show that there are
**other---more powerful---explanations** for war and peace, or even that
the impact of democracy is a **spurious one**]{.underline}, (2) [the
**theoretical foundation** of the democratic peace hypothesis is
**weak**, and the causal mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}, (3)
[democracies are **not necessarily more peaceful**]{.underline} in
general, [and the [evidence]{.mark} for the democratic peace hypothesis
[at the **monadic level** is inconclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}, and (4)
the process of democratization is dangerous and living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country.

In my view, [it is]{.underline} difficult---if not
**[impossible]{.underline}**---[to support the democratic peace
hypothesis]{.underline} without any reservations. The key caveats should
not be ignored and certainly deserve more attention before we can
confidently argue that democracies are more peaceful than other types of
political systems. Please notice that I can already reveal that the
assumed link between democracy and intrastate war is problematic as
well, but this topic will be at the core of the next chapter (Chapter
4).

Selection of Articles: Democracy and War

The instrumental value of democracy cannot convincingly be found in
democracy's expected bond with peace. I have come to this conclusion on
the basis of an analysis of statistical studies, which will be discussed
in the rest of this chapter. So how did I select the articles for my
database?4

For this chapter and Chapter 4, I selected the articles that focused on
war and democracy. Using the online database Web of Science (formerly
known as Web of Knowledge), [I identified]{.underline} a total of almost
**[[8000 articles]{.underline}]{.mark}** published in the sampled
journals until the end of 2015. I identifed them by entering 'democr\*'
in the basic search field; this asterisk (\*)-based 'wildcard' allows
searching for terms including 'democratic', 'democracy', and
'democratization' (in both British and American spellings)
simultaneously, in the title, abstract and/or the keywords. As a next
step, I excluded articles in which 'democracy' is used as synonym for
state (e.g. analysis of the relationship between immigration policies
and unemployment in European democracies) or a specific political party
or movement (e.g. the 'Democrats' in the USA, or Uganda's People's
Democratic Army) or a specifc country (e.g. the Democratic Republic of
Congo). In addition, I identified them by entering 'war\*' in the basic
search feld. The words democracy (democr\*) and war (war\*) need to be
mentioned in title and/or abstract---and I also checked for equivalents
of 'war' like 'conflict' and 'dispute' and 'no peace'.5

As it is not feasible to analyse thousands of articles, it is necessary
to take a next step in the selection process. I decided to select these
articles, which will be part of the database for the third and fourth
chapter, in three different ways. The first method is to choose the
articles with the most citations. So, for example, in Chapter 3, the
articles which are cited more than a hundred times are included in this
first list. The article by Beck et al. (1998) has been cited more than
951 times, and as a consequence, this article is part of the database.
But also articles with a much lower number of citations (such as
Barbieri 1996, with 179 citations) are included in my analyses.

The second method is simply to include the most recent articles
published in the past five years, so since beginning 2011 until end
2015. The most recent articles can easily be overlooked by applying the
first method of most quoted articles. In my view, however, they still
need to be included as they present the most recent findings and engage
with the recent and innovative debates, which cannot be ignored in this
book. For example, recent studies on democracy and interstate war
(Chapter 3) have paid more attention to the mechanisms (see, e.g.,
Zeigler et al. 2014), and there is a growing attention for the impact of
political institutions in recent studies on democracy and intrastate war
(Chapter 4; see, e.g., Walter 2015). Those recent findings cannot be
ignored in any systematic analysis of statistical studies on this theme.

The third method is the most subjective approach of selecting articles,
as it is based on the 'snowballing method'. So it includes articles
which have not been selected by the first and second methods, but which
have been quoted extensively and regularly by the previously selected
articles. For example, the article by Bethany Lacina (2006) cannot be
selected based on having high citations (the first method) and it cannot
be included based on being a recent publication (the second method), but
it has been mentioned by key studies and hence surfaces via the
snowballing method (a third method). This article is important as it
**[clearly [distinguish]{.mark}]{.underline}**es [the]{.underline}
determinants of [**[conflict severity]{.mark}** from]{.underline} those
for **[conflict onset]{.underline}**, and [those [determinants
seem]{.mark} to be **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is
crucial information for Chapter 4.

In this way, my study presents and assesses the findings based on a big
pool of statistical studies in the published literature. Based on this
assessment, I will be able to draw clearer conclusions concerning the
significance of the effects of democracy on interstate war (this
chapter) and intrastate war (the next chapter). The Appendix shows more
detailed information of the selected articles.

The Democratic Peace Hypothesis, Its Roots and Supporters

The democratic peace hypothesis6 states that democracies never or seldom
go to war with one another. Where is this powerful idea of 'democratic
peace' coming from? Before discussing the main findings of the
statistical articles and before describing the four caveats of the
'democratic peace paradigm', we need to know a bit more around the
background and the roots of this idea.

Immanuel Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace has often been mentioned as
the foundation for this hypothesis. Kant believed peace was difficult to
achieve, since 'the natural state is one of war' (Kant 1795: 10). A
state of peace must therefore be established for---in his view---it is
certain that hostilities will be committed and people need to be
protected from each other. In such a world, each may treat his
neighbour, from whom he demands security, as an enemy. In a dictatorship
where 'the subjects are not citizens, a declaration of war is the
easiest thing in the world to decide upon, because war does not require
of the ruler, who is the proprietor and not a member of the state, the
least sacrifice of the pleasures of his table, the chase, his country
houses, his court functions, and the like. He may, therefore, resolve on
war as on a pleasure party for the most trivial reasons, and with
perfect indifference leave the justification which decency requires to
the diplomatic corps who are ever ready to provide it' (Kant 1795: 13).

In contrast, the situation is different in constitutional republics,
according to Kant. He argued that the majority of the people in
republics would never vote to go to war, except for pure self-defence.
Therefore, a world with only republics would be peaceful, since there
would be no aggressors. The republican constitution, which requires the
consent of the citizens to start a war, gives the positive prospect of
perpetual peace.

It is important to note that the ideas of Kant on the one hand and the
modern democratic peace scholars on the other hand are not completely
similar. For example, Kant talked about republics instead of democratic
states as the ideal states to achieve peace. He defined republican
states as states with representative governments, in which the
legislature is separated from the executive. Not
surprisingly---considering the epoch in which he lived---Kant did not
include universal suffrage in his definition, which is now seen as an
essential dimension of democracy, even of the most minimalist types of
democracy (Dahl 1971; see also Chapter 2). Moreover, Kant argued that
republics will be at peace in general, which means that such political
systems are expected to be not only in peace with each other, but also
with other non-republican systems. Nowadays, [**only few scholars**
would support]{.underline} this approach of [a '**monadic democratic
peace**']{.underline}. As will become clear at the end of this chapter,
[there is **[no]{.mark}t much [evidence]{.mark}** for the idea that
[democracies are **more peaceful in general**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the 1960s, most statistical studies have not focused on the
'monadic democratic peace hypothesis' but on testing the 'dyadic
democratic peace hypothesis'. This dyadic hypothesis states that it is
less likely that democracies fight with each other, compared to other
'dyads' or other pairs of different types of political systems. The
sociologist Dean Babst was the first scholar who started to build on
Kant's old idea in the 'dyadic' way, and decided to test it in
statistical studies (Babst 1964, 1972). He concluded that 'no wars have
been fought between independent nations with elective governments
between 1789 and 1941' (Babst 1972: 55). His study was not published in
one of the journals in the field of international relations, but in a
sociological journal and later in Industrial Research. Therefore, it was
not read by international relations scholars, and initially, it did not
get the attention it deserved in the field of international politics.

Babst's work was, for example, not cited by Melvin Small and J. David
Singer (1976), and their fndings seemed to contradict Babst's study.
However, Small and Singer did not compare the rates of war proneness for
democracies and dictatorships, but instead they focused on the question
whether wars involving democratic states have historically been
significantly different in length or in degree of violence compared to
wars involving only dictatorships. For length and degree of violence
during the wars, they did not find a difference between democracies and
dictatorships, so they concluded that types of political systems did not
matter.7 A few years later, Rudolph J. Rummel did cite Babst's work and
replicated Babst's idea in statistical tests, which were described in
the fourth book of his five-volume Understanding Confict and War (1975--
1981). He found clear support for his eleventh (of the 33) propositions
about causes and conditions of conflict, which stated that 'Libertarian
systems mutually preclude violence' (Rummel 1979: 279).

Eventually, those innovative studies from the 1970s helped to evoke the
interest in the democratic peace proposition, and in the expected
peaceful nature of relationships among democratic states. Since the
1980s, the number of quantitative studies has increased considerably,
accumulating into an impressive field of research in international
relations with its own 'empirical law' of democratic peace (Levy 1989:
270; see also Ray 1998).

This democratic peace hypothesis has not only received support from
political scientists, but also from politicians and policy makers.
Particularly since 1993, the idea of a democratic peace has inspired
American foreign policies aimed at the promotion of peace and democracy.
As the 42nd president of the USA (1993--2001), Bill Clinton was the
first politician who explicitly bridged the gap between these findings
in international relations on the one hand, and his foreign policy
strategy on the other hand, at least rhetorically. Anthony Lake, who was
Clinton's National Security Adviser, stated in 1993 that in order to
cope with America's foreign policy challenges, the expansion of
democratic states around the world would be essential because 'it
protects our \[U.S.\] interests and security' (see Henderson 2002: 20).
In his 1994 State of the Union, Clinton declared that 'Ultimately, the
best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack
each other'.8 Findings from research in the field of international
relations seemed to have a direct impact on policy making, and this move
of the Clinton administration can be seen as 'a textbook case of
arbitrage between the ivory tower and the real world' (Gowa 1999: 109).

Clinton's successor, George W. Bush, went one big step further in his
faith that democratic peace holds. He argued that efforts to turn Iraq
into a democratic country would have positive effects on Iraqi's
neighbours. The authoritarian regimes in the region would fall as domino
stones and follow the Iraqi example. They would start democratizing as
soon as they could, which would then result in achieving a peaceful and
stable the Middle East. The real motives for attacking Iraq may have
been different, but 'regime change' was at the heart of Washington's
rhetoric when the USA started to bomb Baghdad in March 2003. The
rhetoric of the Bush administration focused on toppling Saddam Hussein's
regime, and replacing the entire underlying dictatorial system with a
democracy.

Moreover, George W. Bush used the democratic peace idea to justify the
war in Iraq, declaring, 'The reason why I'm so strong on democracy is
democracies don't go to war with each other...I've got great faith in
democracies to promote peace. And that's why I'm such a strong believer
that the way forward in the Middle East, the broader Middle East, is to
promote democracy'.9 In 2004, the 43rd President of the USA said: 'If
you think you can have peace without democracy -- again - I think you'll
find that - I can only speak for myself, that I will be extremely
doubtful that it will ever happen'.10 In his second inaugural address,
he stated that 'the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends
on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world'.

Again, these are just words from speeches and can hence be seen as
rhetoric to defend military intervention (cf. Jervis 2003; Kaufmann
2004; Daalder and Lindsay 2005; Owen 2005; Lieberfeld 2005; Schmidt and
Williams 2008). Still, in the end, politicians have rationalized their
political decisions based on one of the most powerful ideas taken from
studies in the field of international relations, clearly showing the
influence of this academic idea in political practice.

Hence, the field of international relations seems to have its own law:
democracies rarely fight with each other. It cannot be denied that the
evidence supporting the democratic peace proposition is quite diverse in
character (see Ray 1998): the evidence has been epistemological (Rummel
1975), philosophical (Doyle 1986), formal (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
1992), historical (Weart 1994; Ray 1995; Owen 1994), experimental (Mintz
and Geva 1993), anthropological (Ember et al. 1992; Crawford 1994),
psychological (Kegley and Hermann 1995), economic (Brawley 1993; Weede
1996) and political (Gaubatz 1991). Still, there have been numerous
critical studies (see, i.e., Hayes 2011), and the general picture is
unclear. We do not yet know much about the overall findings from
statistical studies.

So far, it seems as if some quantitative studies---mainly within the
field of international relations---have found strong and robust evidence
which supports the 'democratic peace hypothesis'. Those studies show
that democracy has had a positive influence on international peace (see,
i.e., Rummel 1979; Ray and Russett 1996). In this sense, the idea of a
democratic peace seems to be confirmed. Political scientists such as
James Lee Ray are passionate supporters: 'No scientific evidence is
entirely definitive' but 'based on all the empirical evidence so far'
the more defensible of the two possible definitive answers to the
question "Does democracy cause peace?" is "Yes" (Ray 1998: 43). However,
based on my own analyses of the empirical studies with statistical
evidence, I cannot be as enthusiastic as those scholars; to the
contrary, I whole-heartily disagree with them, as a more systematic
analysis of the articles shows that there are four important weaknesses,
which seriously undermines the idea that peace is one of democracy's
instrumental values.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

While analysing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms (see next section, caveat 2), and hence seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this way, the
majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the idea
that democratic peace actually exists without testing this proposition.
However, **[no]{.underline}**ne of the [**studies** that **directly
test** the democratic peace]{.underline} hypothesis [found **strong
evidence** that democracy is the **most important factor** when
explaining interstate war]{.underline}. All democratic peace studies
have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace, such
as [economic development and growth, geographic distance and contiguity,
power status, alliance ties, militarization and political
stability]{.underline}. The findings show that it is not just democracy
which explains war, not at all. Within this group of studies, which
explicitly test the democratic peace hypothesis, four different types of
findings can be detected. I will discuss those results more in-depth in
the rest of this section.

First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Significant Too

The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically significant as well (Maoz and Russett
1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck et al. 1998;
Ray 2013). For example, some studies (e.g. Rousseau et al. 1996)
included alternative independent variables in order to test realist
arguments. They tested whether the distribution of power determines
decisions to use force, and measures each state's military capabilities
relative to its opponent. A state's military capability is the average
of three elements: number of troops, military expenditures and military
expenditures per soldier. They found that this realist variable was
strong, positive and statistically significant at the 0.001 level in
their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However,
not only a state's military capabilities appeared to be an important
explanation for peace. In addition, wealth, growth, alliances and
contiguity played a crucial role when explaining interstate war (see,
e.g., Maoz and Russett 1993: 632, Table 1).11 Moreover, [[when]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** are [included]{.mark}, the **impact of
[democracy]{.mark}** on the likelihood of international crises
[is]{.mark} **even [spurious]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett
1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141, see also p. 3).12 Still, scholars in
this group keep defending the democratic peace idea, despite the fact
that their own analyses showed the significance of alternative
explanations.

Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models

The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau 2013; Gartzke
and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate the spuriousness
of the statistical democratic peace pointed to [other
factors]{.underline} that, [when accounted for '**properly'**,
**eliminated**]{.underline} or dramatically reduced [the statistical
significance of shared democracy]{.underline}. Hence, the studies in
this second group did not find strong evidence for the democratic peace
hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were included in the
models.14

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that [there is **no democratic peace**, but a **capitalist
peace instead**]{.underline}. The settlement in Germany and Japan
succeeded because of the establishment of capitalist peace. Because of
economic support by the Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered
trade opportunities in practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe
and Japan would gain economically, resulting in 'economic growth,
prosperity, and, ultimately, free trade among most of the more
technologically advanced economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By
establishing and expanding free trade, the incentives for war would
quickly decrease among trading states, according to this approach. To
prevent new interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was
a far more important factor than the American promotion of democracy and
its political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014).
[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [peace]{.mark} **only [exists]{.mark}** [when
both]{.mark} democracies [have **high**]{.mark} **levels of economic
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when economic development is well
above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and **[the
[poorest]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4--5% of current [[**democracies**,
are]{.mark} **significantly [more likely]{.mark}** than other kinds of
political systems [to **fight each other**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Mousseau 2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies
involved has a very low level of economic development, then democracy
cannot prevent war.16 Still, there is a pacifying effect of [free trade
and economic interdependence]{.underline}, which [is **more important**
than the effect of democracy]{.underline}, because the former affects
peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development
and ultimately, democracy (see Weede 2004).17

Capitalist peace is not the only alternative explanation. Shared
interests in general, and political similarities in specific, can also
be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and peace
between countries (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997; Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999;
Henderson 2002). [Democracies are **not peaceful** to each other because
they are **democratic**, but rather because they are
**similar**]{.underline}. So the difference of the scores of both
countries also contributes to the conflict proneness of the dyad. If the
difference in levels of democracy is big, then the chance of conflict is
higher (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it difficult to distinguish
between the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the first scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefits of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger

This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for peace
(and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies in
the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically significant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war (Bremer 1992; Gelpi
1997; Oneal and Russett 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002; Peterson 2013;
Caselli et al. 2015).

Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that [democracy is
**not the most important factor**]{.underline}, while war is more likely
to occur between states that are geographically proximate, approximately
equal in power, major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly
militarized than between those that are not. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, [multivariate analyses revealed some
differences]{.underline}. Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that
some factors are far more important than others. [The existence of a
**dangerous, [war]{.mark}-prone dyad** can be **[best explained
by]{.mark}** the **presence of [contiguity]{.mark}**, the **absence of
an [alliance]{.mark}** and the **absence of more advanced
economy**]{.underline}. The absence of democratic polity and other
factors (absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of major
power) are less powerful. Overall, these findings suggest that our
research priorities may be seriously distorted and that we should not
focus too much on the perceived positive impact of democracy, but on
other factors (such as alliances and economic factors) instead.

Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions

The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors. The chance of
democratic peace depends not just on the specific historical period
(Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons 1991;
Weede 1984), but also the stage of the conflict (beginning, duration or
severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed 2000), and on the
neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the region; see Gibler
and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013). Despite the differences
between the studies, there is one common finding in all studies: when
explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on the impact of
democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some specific historical periods. Based on
this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War. For example, Henry Farber and
Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea that peace
between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the threat from
the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another (see
also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued that most of
the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after
World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which
can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and
maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
conflict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the
benefits of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). Moreover, jointly democratic
dyads are likely to be allied only after 1945 (see Gibler and Sarkees
2004); during the 1816--1944 time period, there is even a negative
relationship between democratic dyads and alliance formation.20 These
findings cast serious doubts on the idea of a general existence of
democratic peace.

Not only the historical period, but also [the ***stage*** of the
conflict is crucial]{.underline}. Some scholars in this group provided
evidence that [democratic peace is **not universal**]{.underline}, but
that it depends on the stage and whether we focus on the beginning,
duration or severity of the conflict. Although joint democracy has some
pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results suggest that
they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to war (see Reed 2000).
Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the neighbourhood
instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues over which to
contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region. Democracies only
seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours, and therefore
they can more easily choose favourable conflicts to escalate. The type
of political system does not predict conflict selection or victory once
controls are added for issue salience (Gibler and Miller 2013; see also
Park and James 2015). There is an interaction between joint democracy
and regional instability, which confirms the idea that the effects of
type of political system on continued conflict apply mostly to dyads in
peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see also Park and James
2015). [**Very democratic countries** might]{.underline} even [become
**more aggressive** and **faster** than other political systems, once
the **region** becomes more hostile]{.underline} (see, e.g., Baliga et
al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries (Table 3.1).

Caveat 2: What Are the Causal Mechanisms?

Most of the statistical studies on democratic peace seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war; based on this
assumption, they then decide to focus on the mechanisms. This is
problematic as none of the democratic peace studies found strong
evidence that democracy is the most important factor when explaining
interstate war (see the previous section). As a consequence, the next
step of looking for mechanisms is quite irrelevant and not necessary in
my view, but most studies nevertheless argue that the field lacks strong
theoretical foundations and robust empirical evidence that can reveal
convincing causal mechanisms.22 Those studies seem to accept the
correlation between dyadic democracy and peace, and then start
questioning whether democracy really causes peace before investigating
potential mechanisms.

level)

VI\. THE INTERLOCKING CRISES

In this Part, we highlight how the vulnerabilities of democracy are made
salient as well as exacerbated by climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene. We also emphasize how [**climate change** and **other
problems** of the Anthropocene place **democracies** that attempt to
navigate them in a **particularly impervious Scylla and Charybdis**-like
situation]{.underline}.173 [The Scylla is **ineffective policy**; the
Charybdis is some **relaxation of** the core democratic principle of
**popular sovereignty**. Both options seem nearly **guaranteed** to
trigger **significant legitimacy challenges** to **liberal democratic
systems**]{.underline}.

Traditionally, two important sources of democratic legitimacy have been
beneficial consequences, in the utilitarian tradition, and consent, in
the social contract tradition.174 Whatever else may count as beneficial
consequences, the capacity to solve problems that threaten the physical
and social security of citizens is a central and important source of
democratic legitimacy.175 Call this the "public utility" view of
democratic legitimacy. And whatever else may count as consent, surely
the fact that the majority of citizens have expressed their preference
for a certain candidate, law, or policy is an important source of
democratic legitimacy as well.176 Call this the "expressed preference"
view of democratic legitimacy.

Consider public utility first. As we have pointed out, most
[contemporary **democracies** have]{.underline} thus far [**failed** to
address]{.underline} the **[emerging problems]{.underline}** of the
Anthropocene.177 Consequently, the sense of physical and social
insecurity grows more acute amongst citizens as the problems mount and
compound.178 The legitimacy of these democracies, and the supranational
institutions they have created, such as the European Union and the
United Nations, is thus compromised on public utility grounds.

Now consider expressed preference. [[The **global scope**]{.mark},
long-term reach, unprecedented features, [and **highly complex** nature
of **climate change** and **other problems**]{.mark} of the Anthropocene
[require]{.mark} democracies to make robust commitments to
**[multilateral coop]{.mark}eration**, **[long-term planning]{.mark}**,
significant deviations from the status quo, [and]{.mark} increased
reliance on **[expert knowledge]{.mark}** if they are to succeed in
managing these problems]{.underline}. 179 Citizens' expressed
preferences may be quite distant from this network of commitments and
activities,180 since the benefits of successfully managing a problem
like climate change would mostly accrue not to these citizens, but to
spatiotemporally distant people (i.e., the global poor and future
generations) and genetically distant (non-human) nature. 181 Attempting
to force such commitments, especially at a time when democracies are
already being accused of not being responsive enough to their citizens,
can further compromise legitimacy.182

[We thus face an apparent dilemma: **[if democracies fail]{.mark}** to
successfully address climate change and other problems of the
Anthropocene, [their **legitimacy will be challenged** on **public
utility**]{.mark} grounds. **[If they aggressively]{.mark} attempt to
[address them]{.mark}**[, their **legitimacy will**]{.mark} **likely [be
challenged]{.mark}** [on **expressed preference**]{.mark} grounds.
**[Either way]{.mark}**, we can [**expect** the **power** of
**populist**]{.mark} figures and **[movements to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The remainder of this Part illuminates this dilemma by discussing how
[climate change and other problems]{.underline} of the Anthropocene
[interact [with]{.mark}]{.underline} some further **[[democratic
vulnerabilities:]{.underline}]{.mark}** weak multilateralism,
short-termism, the profusion of veto players, the contested role of
experts, and self-referring decision making.

A. **[[Weak Multilateralism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Climate change cannot be successfully managed without a strong
commitment to international cooperation.183 For a climate regime to
succeed, it must be effective, perceived as at least not unfair by all
parties, and otherwise acceptable to each party.184 At various times,
the attempt to create a regime has foundered on each of these three
considerations.185

From the beginning of the negotiations that led to the adoption of the
FCCC in 1992 and in subsequent negotiations under the Convention, the
question of fairness has been unavoidable.186 When agreements have been
structured in ways that are acceptable to developing countries (e.g.,
the Kyoto Protocol) they have been perceived as unfair by the United
States.187 This has led to the weakening of commitments and to a regime
whose effectiveness is in question.188 The Paris Agreement, by putting
voluntary pledges at the center, was designed to avoid the problem of
perceived unfairness.189 It was reasonably thought that no party could
say that they had been unfairly treated when they have agreed to be
measured in relation to a commitment that they have voluntarily
undertaken and to which no sanctions are attached for non-compliance.
190 Nevertheless, that was exactly the claim made by President Trump in
announcing his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris
Agreement.191 Moreover, the cost of creating an agreement to which no
one could reasonably object was to create an Agreement whose
effectiveness was in question even before the United States announced
its intention to withdraw.192

While climate change is its own "full tragedy and weird comedy," 193
there are structural issues at work.194 As the world order attempts to
adjust to shifting power distributions following the emergence of new
giants such as China and India, when it comes to problems such as
climate change the cooperation of such countries is no longer just
desirable but essential.195 As their collaboration becomes more
valuable, the price for obtaining it rises accordingly.196 This
complicates negotiations, and the problem seems only destined to worsen
because this logic applies not only to presently emerging world powers,
but also to those that have already emerged and those that will emerge
in the future. As we observed in an earlier paper, "\[g\]lobal
governance in the Anthropocene is cooperation-hungry, and this increases
the price of obtaining cooperation from every country."197

In addition, [**democracies** have their own **particular problems**
when it comes to **multilateral agreements**. Except in the rare case
where they are able to steer multilateral agreements in the way they
prefer, democratic governments "[often **seek to avoid
compliance**]{.mark} with binding **multilateral decisions** if [this
**weakens their relationship to their
electorate**]{.mark}]{.underline}."198 [This is in fact what happened in
the case of]{.underline} President [Trump's repudiation of the Paris
Agreement]{.underline}.199 The stated reason was the agreement's
unfairness to the United States.200 However, the deeper reason was that
the Obama administration's decision to join, although admittedly an act
of national self-determination, was not in fact an authentic deliverance
of American popular sovereignty, at least in the eyes of Trump and his
supporters.201 According to Trump,

> \[t\]he Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of
> Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United
> States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American
> workers -- who \[sic\] I love -- and taxpayers to absorb the cost in
> terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly
> diminished economic production.202

In the same speech Trump reminded his audience that "I was elected to
represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."203

In democracies, it is ultimately citizens who empower their
representatives to bargain and strike terms of international
cooperation.204 Successfully addressing the problems of the Anthropocene
is likely to require unprecedented levels of multilateralism.205
Democratic states that attempt to rise to the challenge are likely to
face legitimacy challenges on expressed preference grounds. Those that
do not may face legitimacy challenges on public utility grounds.

B. **[[Short-termism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Short-termism can be defined as "the priority given to present net
benefits at the cost of future ones."206 Short-termism is a problem
whenever policy domains have an extended timeframe, as is the case with
climate change and other systemic problems of the Anthropocene.207 In
these cases, present net benefits may need to be curtailed (through
increases in taxes and regulations, for example) for the sake of
benefits that might materialize in the distant future. These future
benefits will then mostly advantage people other than those who have
borne the costs. Reasons for privileging the present in these cases
include pure time preference, uncertainty, and diminished or even null
moral concern for those who might benefit in the future.208 The
temptation, then, is to eschew the costs of the required policies and
"pass the buck" to future generations.209

Short-termism is not always irrational nor morally wrong.210 It has been
argued, however, that short-termism is both irrational and morally wrong
in the case of climate change.211 The sources of short-termism are
rooted in human psychology and can manifest in any kind of political
regime.212 However, it has been argued that democracies are particularly
vulnerable to short-termism.213

[One important reason for the short-termism of democratic political
regimes is that these regimes inherit, via voting and other forms of
popular influence, their citizens' biases in favor of the present.
**[Policies]{.mark}** may also]{.underline} reflect [citizens'
**[misinformation]{.mark}** about, or unawareness of, long-term
processes, risks, policy aims, and possible outcomes]{.underline}.214
[[To counter]{.mark} these tendencies, liberal democracies [typically
filter]{.mark} their citizens' inter-temporal biases, misinformation,
and unawareness [through]{.mark} such mechanisms as constitutions and
reliance on **[expert bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.215 [[Yet the **more
filtering**]{.mark} they do, [the **more likely**]{.mark} they
[are]{.mark} to incur **[legitimacy challenges]{.mark}** on expressed
preference grounds]{.underline}.216 This is a problem of
intra-generational legitimacy.217

There are also problems of inter-generational legitimacy.218 There is no
guarantee that long-term policies, if enacted, will achieve the
anticipated aims, or that they will indeed make future people better off
by achieving these aims.219 If things do not work out, these policies
might be deemed illegitimate on public utility grounds by the very
future people that they were supposed to benefit.220 In addition, such
policies may be deemed illegitimate by future people on expressed
preference grounds.221 Legitimacy on expressed preference grounds
typically requires some form of authorization by those who are affected
by policies, yet future people who will be affected by past policies
never authorize them, nor can they hold anyone accountable.222

[Another reason for democracies' short-termism is the scheduling of
participatory events]{.underline}.223 Democracy requires elections,
which must be relatively frequent in order to ensure that people can
regularly express their will, vote out politicians who are judged to
have failed in some important ways, and prevent rent-seeking behavior by
not giving politicians enough time to set up camp within
institutions.224 However, [the relatively **short duration of electoral
cycles** ensures that politicians are constantly concerned with their
own reelection, and this may prevent them from taking hard policy
decisions that require a great deal of political capital and do not
produce appreciable outcomes in time for the next
election]{.underline}.225 [Because most of the **[impacts]{.mark}** of
climate change will largely **materialize in the future** and be felt by
future generations, efforts at their alleviation must obey a clock that
is **[not in sync with the electoral clock]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Note that there is no need to assume that politicians are always and
necessarily motivated by only a thirst for power.226 In a democ- racy,
even politicians who are exclusively motivated by the aspiration to make
good long-term policy need to be elected or re-elected to do so.227 In
order to be elected, they need to harness the votes of the current
electorate.228 So, the problem of short-termism goes beyond a lack of
conscientious far-sightedness on the side of politicians: it is
structurally connected to the very fact of popular sovereignty---at
least as long as the majority of people discount the future.229

C. **[[Veto Players]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Any political system (with the possible exclusion of some forms of
anarchy) accords veto powers to some agent: a monarchy to the king, an
aristocracy to the nobility, a technocracy to the experts, a theocracy
to the religious leader, and so on.230 A veto player in a political
system can be understood as an agent who can prevent a departure from
the status quo.231 In democracies, veto players can be specified by
constitutions (e.g., the President and the Congress in the United
States), emerge from the political system (e.g., the Supreme Court in
the United States, political parties that are members of a government
coalition in Western Europe), or from civil society (e.g., powerful
industries, unions or other interest groups in many countries).232

In a democracy, veto players can protect minority interests, prevent
destabilizing change, and preserve important values and policies through
periods in which they are unpopular.233 More generally, veto players
prevent a democratic system from being excessively fluid and
flexible.234 This is attractive when the status quo is desirable or an
exogenous shock is beneficial; however, when the status quo is
undesirable or an exogenous shock disturbs a desirable status quo,
fluidity and flexibility are needed in order to respond quickly

and decisively.235 This is arguably the situation in the case of climate

change, which demands nimble political responses to which veto

players would have to acquiesce.

[The presence of many veto players threatens to delay or even block the
formulation and implementation of policy]{.underline}.236 Liberal
democracies, with their reliance on checks and balances generated by
institutional architecture or by competition among interest groups, seem
particularly vulnerable to such threats---and the more veto players in a
democracy the greater the degree of vulnerability.237

[An **especially high concentration of veto players** helps to explain
why a powerful, rich, technological leader like the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is **uncannily slow** to address consequential
public issues such as the politics of distribution, racial equality,
immigration, the proper balance between liberty and national security,
and of course climate change]{.underline}.238 The United States
Constitution separates powers in the federal government, reserves a
broad range of powers to states and includes a bill of rights that can
be viewed as effectively giving veto powers to individuals in some
circumstances. Practices have also developed through time that inhibit
action, such as requiring supermajorities for some political decisions.

[The profusion of **veto players** may be extreme in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [but it [is]{.mark} a feature
[common to]{.mark} many **[liberal democracies]{.mark}** that often
[makes]{.mark} political [action **elusive**]{.mark} even on relatively
minor policy issues]{.underline}.239 For every possible policy change,
there is always a "do-nothing" alternative (sometimes more respectably
presented as a "wait and see" alternative) that is invariably attractive
to some veto player.240

"Do-nothing" alternatives may sometimes be justified on grounds of
rational choice considerations relating to transition costs and
uncertainty about both the process of transition and the final pay-off
structure.241 Veto players give voice to such considerations, as well as
other considerations that we have already noted.242 But veto players may
also give voice to less rational tendencies, which are inevitably
present and, in democracies, are crystallized in votes. Among these
tendencies may be disproportionate attention to sunk costs, finding
refuge in "what has always worked," fear of regretting the changes made,
the desire to maintain and transmit a sense of control by not acceding
to the demands of new circumstances, and lack of trust in those who are
proposing the changes.243

Veto players tend to slow down or block deviations from the status quo,
and this makes it difficult to tackle climate change and other similar
problems of the Anthropocene.244 But veto players also reflect and
configure real structures of power, and protect and promote the needs
and interests of actual people.245 When the number of veto players or
the importance of specific veto players is altered, new power structures
emerge and this can raise legitimacy challenges on both utility and
expressed preference grounds.246 It is not obvious what veto players
should be eliminated or demoted in order to produce more nimble and
effective climate policy, and which ones should be given additional
power instead. Nor is it obvious who should decide the answers to these
questions (if not the people) and on what grounds (if not majority
rule).

Veto players configure systems of checks and balances, filters and
buffers, which are only partially exposed to popular influence.247 This
anti-majoritarian service is particularly precious to liberal
democracies, which rely on veto players to protect and promote the
rights of individuals and minorities---and, with that, the core liberal
principles of individual liberty and human rights. However, as a
consequence, if a majority exists that is overwhelmingly convinced by
climate science, totally in favor of leaving all remaining fossil energy
sources in the ground, and ready to embark on ambitious renewable energy
programs, this majority may still find it difficult to act. Liberal
democracies protect minorities of various kinds in varying degrees, and
these include climate change denialists and those who profit from fossil
fuels. Economically powerful and en- trenched economic minorities (the
"1%") are often extremely effective veto players.248 This can prevent
action that would benefit most people, thus increasing the risks of
legitimacy challenges.

D. **[Contested Role of Experts]{.underline}**

Climate change and other problems of the Anthropocene are unprecedented
phenomena whose complexity and implications are only beginning to be
understood by scientists and other experts. Climate change is a
multidimensional problem that concerns and connects ecology, demography,
development, production, consumption, resource use, trade rules, health,
security, urban planning, mobility, migration, and more, in novel
ways.249 It poses threats that are multi-scalar, probabilistic,
indirect, often invisible, spatiotemporally unbound, and potentially
catastrophic. These threats challenge our reason, emotions, and
imagination.250 If there were ever a complex problem that required
expert knowledge, it is climate change.

Liberal democracies make significant use of expert knowledge in
policymaking in various ways to protect liberal values, and to boost
their efficiency, equity, and political stability.251 Expert knowledge
is distinguished from non-expert opinion through such criteria as
experience, professional and educational qualifications, peer-review,
and rules of evidence.252

Still, in a democracy, differences in expertise do not translate to
differences in political authority, for much the same reason why
differences in lineage do not translate in this way. A democratic
citizen can recognize expertise and accept the science of, say, climate
change, and still object to the expert who counsels some course of
action: "You may be right, but who made you boss?"253 In a democracy,
expertise is always subservient to the voice of the people (pace Plato,
philosophers cannot be kings).254

For this reason, the relationships between experts and ordinary citizens
are always potentially fraught in a democracy. These relationships vary
from country to country, time to time, and issue to issue. Often, the
relationships are placid in good times and rocky in hard times. Major
policy failures, such as the global financial crisis of 2008 and the
spreading of terrorist radicalization in many European Union countries,
can lead citizens to question experts' knowledge and see them as just
another interest group seeking rents at people's expense.255

In the case of climate change, an additional element makes the role of
experts potentially unpopular. Climate science, in our present social
context, inevitably provokes fundamental questions about how we ought to
live and organize our societies, throwing doubt on the ways in which we
do so now. A particularly powerful and widespread attempt to avoid
cognitive dissonance through various forms of rationalization may thus
come into play. After all, if something potentially catastrophic such as
climate change can result from the very ways in which we live our
everyday lives---how we dwell, how we eat, how we make things, how we
move around---the nagging thought is that there might be something
fundamentally wrong about the ways in which we live. These are not
comfortable thoughts and can lead to resentment or worse towards those
who bear the message.

The incipient conflict and simmering resentment has been exploited by
powerful interests who look to be the immediate losers from a transition
to a more sustainable way of life. They stoke the dissonance and
encourage denialism. The most obvious manifestation of this is the
climate change denial campaign, directed towards preventing the
formation of a consensus for political action on climate change.256

The main strategy of climate change denialists has been to suppress both
belief in the science and belief that there is a scientific consensus on
the existence, anthropogenic nature, and dangerousness of climate
change.257 In its aims and strategies, climate change denialism has
replicated earlier forms of denialism involving tobacco smoking, acid
rain, DDT, and ozone depletion. 258

The rhetorical techniques adopted by climate change denialism have also
not been particularly original: versions of these techniques were used
in all the other cases mentioned above. These techniques include
attacking sources rather than discussing evidence, "moving the goalpost"
by requesting ever larger amounts of evidence, submitting false
evidence, suggesting false equivalences or analogies, confusing
ignorance about mechanisms or processes with ignorance about facts or
outcomes, cherry-picking anomalies, selective skepticism, quote mining,
and the so-called "Gish gallop"---overwhelming discussants or audiences
with unscientific claims to make it difficult to counter all the
misinformation at once.259

What is new about denialism in the Anthropocene is not its strategies or
tactics, but its amplification. Expertise denialism now travels through
social media, which allows for unfiltered instant communication among
citizens and between citizens and representatives. Traditional
intermediaries---political parties, intellectuals, and the professional
press---are increasingly made redundant by these technologies. Indeed,
to maintain their relevance (and market share), these traditional
intermediaries often seek to replicate the immediacy and excitement of
social media, compromising their own claims to epistemological or
institutional privilege.

One effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is an increased tendency to
brand political ideas and policy proposals and to market them as
products.260 The need to engage audiences with arguments and relevant
facts---and even to maintain consistency in one's opinions--- decreases,
while the need for a good, resonant, quick-win pitch increases. With
that, the importance of expert knowledge is downplayed to the advantage
of skilled branding and marketing.

Another effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is a polarizing fragmentation,
not just at the level of policy judgments, but also regarding the sets
of facts to which different individuals and groups make reference.
Social media allows for networked, yet highly fragmented, political
communication, making it harder to individuate and even debate a common
story.261

Much empirical work in psychology, economics, political science,
sociology, and communications has gone into trying to explain how and
why disagreement about facts can occur.262 The explanation seems to be
some sort of "biased assimilation," whereby people adjust their view of
facts with reference to their self-defining values, social identities,
and partisan allegiances.263 Experiments on reception suggest that
individuals selectively credit or dismiss information in a manner that
reinforces beliefs congenial to their values.264 These experiments found
that subjects were substantially more likely to count a scientist as an
authoritative "expert" when the scientist was depicted as taking a
position consistent with the subjects' cultural predispositions, than
when that scientist took a contrary position.265 Interestingly, these
tendencies seem to be directly, rather than inversely, related to levels
of science literacy and general education of experimental subjects: the
more equipped people are to know and understand the facts, the more they
disagree on them.266

In times of social media, these tendencies may be amplified, insofar as
individuals tend to gravitate towards and engage mostly with resonant
networks of "like-me's" that by and large reaffirm their own values and
perspectives.267 This may tribalize positions and impede constructive
democratic engagement and debate from ever taking off on many contested
issues. In addition, one can expect increasing polarization to also be
fomented by individuals and groups trying to secure loyalty to their
branded political ideas and policy proposals in this way.

The internet and other media, with their seemingly endless resources,
create the impression that expertise can be picked and chosen at will,
thereby feeding the perception of public life as a spectacle.268 Public
discussions, unfiltered by "moderators," unfold in a denuded space
stripped of epistemological norms.269 In the United States at least,
this has morphed into a generalized atmosphere of expertise denialism
writ large. Denialism about evolution, vaccines, economics, and more has
become commonplace.270

It is not an exaggeration to say that we are on the verge of adopting
epistemological nihilism as a public epistemology.271 No commitment to
facts, in the traditional sense, or even consistency of opinion, is
required.272 Truth is what the speaker says it is, here and now. In a
moment it may be different, depending on what the speaker can get away
with. In a democracy, it is up to elections or approval ratings to
resolve disagreements. It is a short step from here to other exercises
of power.

The nihilistic turn in public epistemology threatens the legitimacy of
democracy, for democracy cannot solve the problems it faces without
mobilizing epistemological authority that is itself hostage to popular
vote. As difficult as this challenge may be in favorable times, it is
greatly magnified in the face of climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene.

E. Self-referring Decision-making

What we have elsewhere called the "agency presupposition" is deeply
entrenched in modern democratic theory. This presupposition holds "that
the political community is constituted by agents who initiate and
conduct political action, and who themselves, and their interests and
welfare, are what matter politically."273 The agency presupposition
arose at a time in which democratic principles, norms and institutions
were being developed to govern relations between agents who lived in
close proximity to one another in space and time, and whose decisions
and actions had relatively direct impacts on each other. However, around
1950, a profound change occurred from a world of discrete but
interdependent states to a world of shared social space in which distant
events have localized impacts and vice-versa. In this globalized world,
the fates of nation-states and their peoples became not just effectively
interdependent, but also structurally interconnected, with social,
political, and economic activities, interactions, and infrastructures
stretching beyond political frontiers, leading to a deepening enmeshment
of the local and the global.274 Political decisions and actions taken
locally (in selected powerful countries, many of which were democratic)
now systematically had planetary implications, impacting for better or
worse the welfare and interests of people in all corners of the world.

With the Anthropocene disruption of earth's fundamental ecological
systems, including those that govern climate, political agents (living
humans who can initiate and conduct political action) have gained
unprecedented power over a vast universe of non-agents that comprises
animate and inanimate nature as well as those living on the periphery of
both space and time.275 The circle of affected nonagents has expanded
beyond cultural, genetic, and spatiotemporal boundaries to include
virtually everything on the planet, now extended indefinitely in
time.276 This establishes an enormous asymmetry of power. Those on the
periphery, and nature, cannot initiate and conduct political action:
they cannot reciprocate, they cannot participate, they cannot protest,
they cannot retaliate.277 In democratic terms, they do not matter---or
only matter derivatively, if political agents care about their fate. And
it is as undemocratic as can be, particularly if the democracy in
question is a liberal democracy, to force political agents to care if
they do not.278

A phenomenon like climate change creates ubiquitous tensions and
trade-offs between agents and non-agents---those who are governed, and
those who are affected.279 The latter will suffer most from climate
change, but a democracy responsive to the claims of future generations
(or those living beyond its borders, or nonhuman nature) may often have
to forgo opportunities for bringing beneficial consequences to those who
empower it with their votes.280 Instead, democratic leaders would have
to enact policies favoring the interests of those who do not vote
because they do not yet exist (or live in different countries or are not
human).

Democracies making policies that favor non-agents will expose themselves
to intra-generational legitimacy challenges on both public utility
grounds and expressed preference grounds.281 Even if the expected
benefits to non-agents were great, such non-agent-oriented policies
might not win the hearts, minds, and guts of living human agents who may
express their preference for themselves instead--- particularly in
democracies that are already being accused of not being responsive
enough to their citizens.282 Many believe that ignoring or heavily
discounting the welfare and interests of non-agents is morally wrong,
but if expressed preference is important, it may be a wrong that
democracies cannot avoid committing.283

The agency presupposition makes government responsive to those who are
governed but not to those who are affected beyond borders in space,
time, citizenship, or genetic make-up. A basic presupposition of liberal
democracy appears to be threatened by the very actions that would have
to be taken to express concern for all those affected by the
climate-changing and eco-altering actions of its citizens.

VII\. CONCLUSION

We began this Article by explaining the notion of the Anthropocene and
briefly telling the story of failed responses to climate change. We went
on to discuss the uneasy relationship between climate change and
democracy, focusing on liberal democracy in particular. We presented
some basic aspects of democratic theory and practice, and discussed some
of democracy's main vulnerabilities. We showed how in the Anthropocene
these vulnerabilities can magnify, leading to legitimacy challenges.

[These legitimacy challenges are not new. Democracy has always been
haunted by anxiety about its future]{.underline}. Some political
theorists have argued that [**[democracy]{.mark}** is the only form of
political organization that **[underwrites]{.mark}** the seeds of **[its
own destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.284 [Demagogues and extremists
who wish to blow up the state are allowed the same freedoms as those who
seek to manage it more fairly and effectively]{.underline}. [The risk of
a [**democratically enabled democide** is **not**]{.mark} an
[**abstract** or **counterfactual**]{.mark} risk: the executioners of
German democracy came to power through the rules and procedures of the
**Weimar Republic**]{.underline}.285 If we open our eyes, we may see
these stories going on around us today.

Modern democracy is, in many respects, the most sophisticated
articulation of the human capacity for social organization. It is also
the most hospitable environment for the expression of human values that,
through centuries of emancipatory struggles, have come to be regarded as
fundamental, such as individual liberty and political equality.286 Our
objective in this Article is not to write a requiem for democracy, but
rather to chart the seas that democratic theory and practice will have
to navigate in order to successfully address climate change and survive
the challenges of the Anthropocene. We have highlighted the
vulnerabilities of democracy in order to throw in sharp relief the many
challenges entailed by the voyage, not to discourage it. Democracy has
shown itself to be remarkably resilient in the past, and it may well
succeed in rising to these challenges as well. There are those who think
that democracy doesn't stand a chance.287 But many still believe that
the only solution to the problems of the Anthropocene lies in more,
better, or different democracy.288 And there are those who think that
even if democracy fails these challenges, democracy itself will not have
failed. For they see its value as intrinsic, and not just as a means to
better or more effective governance.289

It is difficult to sketch the nature of possible democratic solutions to
some of the issues that we have raised, and we will not try to do so
here. Instead, we will close with a summary of what seems to be the main
challenge ahead. The existing democratic deficits in liberal countries
will generally have to be reduced. Yet, in the case of climate change
and other problems of the Anthropocene, liberal democratic countries
will have to muster both the internal coherence and strength to better
resist populism, and the external coherence and strength to be more
cooperative partners within the framework of supranational institutions.
This is necessary because, in the Anthropocene, the global spills into
the domestic and vice-versa: a globally changing climate may have
pernicious local impacts on the territory and population of any given
country, while [[**political dysfunction in one country**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} cripple **[[\[halt\] efforts at global
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The democracies of the Anthropocene will have to work at multiple scales
in both space and time, incorporating the interests of the global with
those of the local, and those of the future with those of the present.
This seems to suggest, perhaps paradoxically, that the democracies of
the Anthropocene will have to be more democratic in some respects and
less democratic in others. The relation between popular sovereignty and
institutions that limit popular sovereignty while respecting it is a
tug-of-war in democratic theory and practice that has been going on for
millennia, and is now being put to unprecedented tests.

Liberal democracies, in particular, have an enormous amount at stake.
Liberal political theory has always recognized the right to resist and
even overthrow illegitimate political power.290 This right has been used
to justify historical events that liberals typically applaud, including
the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, and the American
Revolution.291 Despite their failures and excesses, these revolutions
forwarded liberal values and helped to entrench them in institutions.
Unable to find consistent responses to challenges to their own
legitimacy in the Anthropocene, liberal democracies may be in danger of
warranting revolutions against themselves and the very institutions that
should realize their values. They may become the ancient regime.

This might be taken to suggest, as one writer has characterized it, that
"terrorism is such a minor threat to American life and limb that
[[it's]{.mark} simply **bizarre**---just **[stupefyingly irrational and
intellectually unserious]{.mark}**---to suppose that it could even
**begin** to justify]{.underline} the abolition of privacy rights as
they have been traditionally understood in favour of the installation of
a panoptic [surveillance]{.underline} state." 1 And [terrorism
**specialist**]{.underline} Marc Sageman [characterizes [the
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} terrorists present in the United States
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} "rather
**[[negligible]{.underline}]{.mark}**." 2 The vast majority of what is
commonly tallied as [terrorism]{.underline} has occurred **[in war
zones]{.underline}**, and this is especially true for fatalities.3 But
**[even]{.underline}** this [[has been
**exaggerated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by [conflating
**terror**]{.mark}ism [with **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}: civil war
violence that would previously have been seen to be acts of insurgency
are now often labeled terrorism.4

In order to put the numbers in some context, it has often been pointed
out that **[[far more]{.mark} Americans [are killed]{.mark} each
year]{.underline}** [not only by such]{.underline} highly
**[destructive]{.underline}** [hazards as **drug**]{.underline}
overdose**[s]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[automobile]{.underline}** accident**[s]{.underline}**, [but even
by]{.underline} such comparatively **[minor]{.underline}**
[ones]{.underline} as lightning, accident-causing
**[deer]{.underline}**, **[peanut]{.underline}** allergie[**s**, or
**[drowning in bathtubs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some comparisons are
arrayed in Table 1.

In recent years, however, critics have attacked what they call "the
bathtub fallacy." 5

First, they stress that it is important to keep in mind that bathtubs
are not out to kill you while terrorism is a willful act carried out by
diabolical, dedicated, and clever human beings. Thus, although the
number of people Islamist terrorists have been able to kill in the West
since 9/11 has thus far been quite limited, those terrorists, as they
plot and plan and learn from experience, may very well become far more
destructive in the future.

Second, the critics charge that the comparison of terrorism with bathtub
drownings is incomplete in that it doesn't consider the possibility that
the incidence of terrorist destruction is low precisely because
counterterrorism measures are so effective.

Third, it is argued that, unlike bathtub drownings, terrorism exacts
costs far beyond those entailed in the event itself. It damagingly sows
terror, fear, and anxiety; disturbs our

psychological well-being; undermines trust and openness within the
society; and reduces our sense of intrinsic moral worth even as it
increases a sense of helplessness. They maintain, fourth, that the
comparison is invalid because, unlike terrorism, bathtubs provide
benefit.

And finally, they contend that terrorism costs are peculiarly high,
particularly in a democratic society, because the fears it generates
will necessarily need to be serviced by policy makers, and this pressure
forces, or inspires, them to adopt countermeasures, both foreign and
domestic, that are costly and sometimes even excessive.

In this article, we examine these five propositions and find all of them
to be wanting. In the process, we conclude that terrorism is rare
outside war zones because, to a substantial degree, terrorists don't
exist there. In general, as with rare diseases that kill few, it makes
more policy sense to expend limited funds on hazards that inflict far
more damage.

Terrorism is willed and may well become more destructive

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg has suggested that "the fear of terrorism
isn't motivated solely by what terrorists have done, but what terrorists
hope to do." Bathtubs are simply not "engaged in a conspiracy with other
bathtubs to murder ever-larger numbers of Americans." However,
terrorists "in the Islamist orbit," he insists, "seek unconventional
weapons that would allow them to kill a far-larger number of Americans
than died on Sept. 11." 6 Or as Janan Ganesh of the Financial Times puts
it, "Bathroom deaths could multiply by 50 without a threat to civil
order. The incidence of terror could not." 7

Thus far, [9/11 stands out as an **extreme outlier**: scarcely any
terrorist act, before or after, in war zones or outside them, has
inflicted **even one-tenth**]{.underline} [as much]{.underline} total
[destruction]{.underline}. That is, contrary to common expectations,
[the attack has]{.underline} thus far [been an]{.underline}
[**aberration**, **not** a **harbinger**]{.underline}.8 And
[**[a]{.mark}**l-**[Q]{.mark}**aeda central]{.underline}, the group
responsible for the attack, [has]{.underline}, in some respects at
least, [[proved]{.mark} to resemble]{.underline} President John
Kennedy's assassin, [**Lee Harvey Oswald**---an entity
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[trivial proportions]{.underline}**
[that got]{.underline}]{.mark} **[horribly [lucky
once]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The tiny group of perhaps 100 or so does
appear to have served as something of an inspiration to some Muslim
extremists. They may have done some training, may have contributed a bit
to the Taliban's far larger insurgency in Afghanistan, and may have
participated in a few terrorist acts in Pakistan. In his examination of
the major terrorist plots against the West since 9/11, Mitchell Silber
finds only two---the shoe bomber attempt of 2001 and the effort to blow
up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs in 2006---that could be
said to be under the "command and control" of al-Qaeda central (as
opposed to ones suggested, endorsed, or inspired by the organization),
and there are questions about how full its control was even in these two
instances, both of which, as it happens, failed miserably.9 And,
although some al-Qaeda affiliates have committed substantial damage in
the Middle East, usually in the context of civil wars, their efforts to
carry out terrorism in the West have been rare and completely
ineffective.10 Even under siege, it is difficult to see why al-Qaeda
could not have carried out attacks at least as costly and shocking as
the shooting rampages (organized by other groups) that took place in
Mumbai in 2008 or at a shopping center in Kenya in 2013. Neither took
huge resources, presented major logistical challenges, required the
organization of a large number of perpetrators, or needed extensive
planning.

However, [there is of course no guarantee that things will
**remain**]{.underline} [that way, and the 9/11 attacks inspired the
remarkable **extrapolation**]{.underline} [that, because the
[terrorists]{.mark} were **successful with box cutters**, they might
**soon** be [able to **turn**]{.mark} **out weapons of mass
destruction**--- particularly **[nuclear]{.mark}**]{.underline}
ones---and then detonate them in an American city. For example, in his
influential 2004 book, Nuclear Terrorism, Harvard's Graham
**[Allison]{.underline}** [relayed]{.underline} his "considered
judgment" [that]{.underline} "on the current path, [a nuclear terrorist
attack on America in the **decade**]{.underline} ahead [is]{.underline}
more **[likely]{.underline}** than not." 11 Allison has had a great deal
of company in his alarming pronouncements. In 2007, the distinguished
physicist Richard Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an
American or European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per
year, which would work out to 91 percent over the elevenyear period to
2018.12

**[Allison's time is up]{.underline}**, and so is Garwin's.
[These]{.underline} oft-repeated [[warnings have
proven]{.underline}]{.mark} to be **[[empty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And
it is important to point out that [[not only]{.mark} have terrorists
**[failed]{.mark}** to go nuclear, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} as William
Langewiesche, who has assessed the process in detail, put it in 2007,
"[[The **best info**]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark} that **[no one has
gotten]{.mark} anywhere [near]{.mark}**]{.underline} this. I mean, if
you look carefully and practically at this process, you see that [[it
is]{.mark} an **enormous undertaking**]{.underline} [[full of
**risks**]{.mark} for]{.underline} the would-be
[terrorists]{.underline}." 13 [That process [requires trusting
**corrupt**]{.mark}ed foreign [**collaborators**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[**criminals**, obtaining]{.mark} and
transporting highly]{.underline} [[**guarded material**, setting
up]{.mark} a machine shop staffed with **[top
scientists]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technicians]{.underline}**, [[and **rolling**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[heavy]{.underline}**, cumbersome, and
**[[untested]{.underline}]{.mark}** finished
**[[product]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into]{.underline}
**[position]{.underline}** [to be detonated [by a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[skilled crew]{.underline}**]{.mark}, all the [while [attracting **no
attention**]{.mark}]{.underline} from outsiders.

[[Nor]{.mark} have terrorist groups been [able to steal]{.mark} existing
nuclear]{.underline} [[weapons]{.mark}---characteristically burdened
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[multiple [safety
devices]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} often [stored
in]{.underline} pieces at separate **[secure
locales]{.underline}**---from existing arsenals as was once much feared.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} [they certainly have [not]{.mark} been able
to [cajole]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[leaders]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
nuclear states [[to]{.underline} **[palm one off]{.underline}**]{.mark}
to them---though a war inflicting more death than Hiroshima and Nagasaki
combined was launched against Iraq in 2003 in major part under the spell
of fantasies about such a handover.14

More generally, [the **actual [terrorist]{.mark}**]{.underline}
"adversarie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in the **West**]{.underline}
**[scarcely]{.underline}** [deserve accolades for either **dedication**
or **prowess**]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that sometimes even
incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are
rare. [For the most part, terrorists in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[are a
**confused**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[inadequate]{.underline}**,
**[[incompetent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[blundering]{.underline}**,
and **[gullible [bunch]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [only]{.underline}
**[occasionally]{.underline}** [able to get their act together. Most
seem to be far [better at **frenetic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and often
**[self-deluded [scheming]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} at [actual
**[execution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A summary assessment by RAND's
Brian Jenkins is apt: "[their **numbers** remain **small**, their
**determination limp**, and their **competence poor**]{.underline}." 15
And much [the same holds for **Europe**]{.underline} [and the
**rest**]{.underline} [of the developed world]{.underline}.16 Also
working against terrorist success in the West is the fact that [almost
**[all]{.mark}** are **[amateurs]{.mark}**: they have never before tried
to do something like this. Unlike **criminals** they have **not been
able to develop street smarts**.]{.underline}

[Except perhaps for the use of vehicles to [deliver]{.mark}
mayhem]{.underline} (though this idea is by no means new in the history
of terrorism), [there has been]{.underline} remarkably **[[little
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terrorist weaponry or methodology
since 9/11]{.underline}.17 Like their predecessors, [they have continued
to rely on bombs]{.underline} (many of which fail to detonate or do much
damage) [and bullets]{.underline}.18

Cautions and Caveats

It is important to note that [scientific advances and]{.underline} the
[**emergence** of **new tech**nologies are **not** the only, or even the
**most important**, factors **influencing** the [**likelihood** of
**terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}** acquiring and **[using CBRN
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thankfully, the [[number of]{.mark}
terrorist [groups]{.mark} motivated to acquire these weapons [has been
limited, despite]{.mark} [many that have]{.mark}]{.underline} the
requisite [technical and financial [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.60
The [**[vast majority]{.mark}** of **terrorist** groups have been
[**satisfied** with **conventional**]{.mark} **weapons**]{.underline}
such as guns and bombs. The surprising rise of the Islamic State and
their repeated use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria, however, serve
as a reminder that it only takes one group with the intent and
capability to acquire and use CBRN weapons to pose a threat to
international security.61

In addition, the [[ability]{.mark} of a terrorist group to convert
CBRN-related material into a weapon [depends on]{.mark}]{.underline}
intangible factors such as **[[tacit knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(the unarticulated knowledge that can only be gained through hands-on,
trial-and-error experience or mentorship), the [**ability** of the group
to **create and share** such **knowledge**, [and its ability to
**assemble**]{.mark} and successfully **manage** **interdisciplinary
teams**]{.underline}.62 [Terrorist [groups]{.mark}, especially those
**facing pressure** from **law enforcement** and **intel**ligence
agencies, [have had **difficulties** **recruiting**]{.mark},
**retaining**, [and]{.mark} effectively [**utilizing** individuals
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [right **combination** of **scientific**,
**technical**, and **organizational [skills]{.mark}** to develop
effective CBRN weapons]{.underline}.

[Developing a CBRN weapon capable of]{.underline} causing [**mass
casualties** is also a **very complex** process. A scientific
[breakthrough that makes]{.mark} **developing** or acquiring **[one
component]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a weapon [[easier]{.mark} might [not
have any impact on]{.mark} the [other stages]{.mark} in the
weaponization process]{.underline}. Thus, the [impact of a single
scientific breakthrough]{.underline} or a novel technology on the
acquisition of a CBRN weapon [should not be exaggerated]{.underline}.
For example, [**[syn]{.mark}**thetic **[bio]{.mark}**logy might make it
easier]{.underline} for a non-state actor [to create]{.underline} a
pathogen, [but]{.underline} that technology [**[does not help]{.mark}**
terrorists improve their **[ability to disseminate]{.mark}** the
pathogen on a large scale]{.underline}.63

Likewise, it is important to assess the [specific contributions that a
particular technology can make to a specific aspect of]{.underline} the
[CBRN threat in practice, not just in theory]{.underline}. In the case
of [[3D printing]{.underline}]{.mark}, this manufacturing technology [is
**[not appropriate]{.mark}** for working with **[metals]{.mark}** that
[are **toxic** or **radioactive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
microreactors are well-suited to covertly producing small quantities of
highly pure chemicals, [they are **not well-suited** to]{.underline} the
[production of **most chemical warfare agents**]{.underline} and
precursors [due to **[excessive heat]{.mark}** generated]{.underline} by
their synthesis [[and]{.mark} by the **production** of **[solid
byproducts]{.mark}** that would **[clog]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[microfluidic [channels]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the heart of this
technology.64

Finally, [[advances in]{.mark} science and **[tech]{.mark}**nology
represent]{.underline} not just threats, but also [opportunities to
[make it harder]{.mark} for terrorist groups [to acquire]{.mark} CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nmanned
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial and ground
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [can be
[used for border security]{.mark}, CBRN weapon [detection, and]{.mark}
bomb [disposal]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the EU is sponsoring
the development of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to investigate
CBRN crime scenes under the ROCSAFE project.65 [[Biometrics]{.mark} and
radio frequency ID chips can be used to [improve **physical
security**]{.mark} **measures** and **inventory control** to prevent
unauthorized access to CBRN materials]{.underline}. Advances in science
and technology are also leading to **[improved
[sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [can be used to [detect]{.mark} the
**[production]{.mark}**, **transportation**, and **use** of CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. The [development of dedicated laboratories and new
techniques to analyze CBRN materials has also contributed to impressive
advances in nuclear, biological, and chemical forensics, which are
crucial for attribution]{.underline}.66

With dozens of treaty allies and a strategic priority of promoting the
sovereignty of weak states, [the U.S. **[military]{.mark}** has been
gradually **[shifting]{.mark}** from a force designed for confrontation
[to]{.mark} one intended to promote international
**cooperation**]{.underline}. To be sure, the U.S. military retains a
technical and doctrinal advantage as a warfighting entity. However, over
the past two decades, the military has been incorporating new
organizations, doctrine, and training to prioritize efforts to prevent
war [through **[security]{.mark} force
[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has shifted focus to weak
states where sub-national (e.g., gangs in Central America) and
trans-national security challenges (e.g., al-Qa'ida) jeopardize
sovereignty and regional stability.1 Consequently, countries such as the
Philippines, Georgia, Colombia, Uganda, and Pakistan have requested
security assistance from the United States. While level of support
varies, U.S. forces are enabling partner countries to combat challenges
that threaten their own stability.

[This shift in focus [has **raised concerns** about]{.mark} the
"**[militarization]{.mark}** of U.S. **fo**reign
**po**licy,"]{.underline} which began in the 1990s with the recognition
that combatant commanders are as much policy entrepreneurs as they are
war fighters.2 Generals like Tony Zinni or Wesley Clark epitomized the
new breed of warrior-diplomat who directly engaged with foreign heads of
state.3 Far from rogue generals, these military leaders were directed by
President Bill Clinton to engage with the world and promote security by
assisting partners and assuring allies in a security environment freed
from the Cold War dynamic. President George W. Bush and President Barack
Obama continued the practice of using the military to assist almost
every government of the world. As Administrations from both parties came
to value the military's capabilities in peace and war, [some contended
that defense overshadowed (if not displaced) traditional diplomacy and
development efforts]{.underline}.4 Within defense circles, [critics
assumed that helping weak states **jeopardized** American **military
dominance** and **undercut preparations for major war**]{.underline}.5
More recently, [[critics highlight]{.mark} that in an era of declining
budgets, the]{.underline} United States [military cannot afford nor
overcome **[unintended consequences]{.mark}** of attempting to be a
"global force for good."]{.underline}6 These are valid concerns,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States shows no signs of
retreating from a global leadership role and instead seeks partnerships
as a key component of U.S. strategy.

With shared challenges of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and
shared goals of development and protecting human security, there are
unprecedented levels of international cooperation to share information,
target terrorists, and provide governments the tools they need to
confront national threats before they become regional ones. This is on
display in Afghanistan where 50 countries operate under the ISAF flag,
or in the Indian Ocean where 27 countries operate as Combined Maritime
Forces. At the center of the coalitions is a U.S.-sponsored framework to
enable partners to contribute to international security.

President Barack Obama intends to continue the American tradition of
enabling partners throughout the globe. As he noted in his second
inaugural address, "America will remain the anchor of strong alliances
in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that
extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. For no one has a greater
stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation." [By [training
and equipping]{.mark} other militaries, the goal is to
**[reduce]{.mark}** U.S. American [**military presence internationally**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} allow others to provide for their own security.
[This [has **positive benefits**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only for the
U.S. defense budget (e.g., an Afghan soldier costs hundreds per month
compared to an American soldier who costs thousands per month), but also
[[for **international security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While my earlier
book Exporting Security explains why the United States assists
governments from Afghanistan to Zambia, an overlooked area is security
assistance provided to developed countries.

CAPACITY MATTERS

As France recently learned in Mali, while it has capable ground forces
and aircraft, it has limited ability to sustain these forces just 2,000
miles from home. To support its foreign policy agenda, France needed the
United States Air Force to fly its forces and refuel its attack
aircraft. As the operation continues, the United States will probably
provide intelligence for French and African forces as they shift to
stability operations.

Counterterrorism can certainly explain U.S. intervention in Mali;
however, enabling French success explains the timeline. More
importantly, the case of U.S.-supported French intervention in Mali is
illustrative of the role the United States plays in supporting developed
countries. France is the latest developed country to need U.S.
assistance, but requests like this are common. This is true for almost
every one of the 50 countries serving in Afghanistan today, as it was
true with European countries in the Balkans, Australian forces in East
Timor, and British forces in West Africa. These examples highlight that
the foreign policy goals of many developed countries exceed their
military capacity, which requires them to rely on the U.S. military for
assistance. As developed countries' defense budgets fall further,
reliance on the United States is going to increase. This remains a
decades-old frustration. Most recently, the NATO Secretary General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, "There is a lower limit on how little we can
spend on defense, while living up to our responsibilities.\"7

Pragmatically, the United States would like its partners to do more, but
shared challenges and limited budgets will reinforce the value of
American logistics, combat experience, and intelligence capacity.
Further, American support of other countries reinforces the treaty
arrangements with 27 NATO countries and five Asian countries. Twenty
years ago, there seemed to be little relevance to these treaties and
security arrangements, let alone a rationale for invoking them or
expanding them. Yet, the opposite occurred. NATO increased its
membership three times from 16 to 19 in 1999, again to 26 in 2006, and
again to 28 in 2009. At the same time the number of NATO members
increased, NATO changed from its traditional mission of territorial
defense to one of global security engagement. With each expansion, new
members require training and equipping to NATO standards. With each new
operation, NATO countries require access to U.S. intelligence, critical
technology, and global logistics.

In addition to formal treaties of alliance, an additional dozen
countries are offered protection under the U.S. security umbrella either
by law, such as the Taiwan Relations Act or by policy such as United
States' support for Israel.8 These protections include provisions to
train and equip their militaries. Another dozen countries are offered
special security provisions through Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status.
MNNA does not confer a mutual defense relationship, but the largely
symbolic act implies a close working relationship with another
country\'s defense forces.9 It is more akin to a preferred buyer's
program allowing countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea access
to advanced weapons systems. With weapons purchases also come long-term
training and maintenance contracts. From a U.S. perspective, it has a
comparative advantage in defense exports; strategically, programs like
these are intended to overcome the free-rider problem the United States
faces with its partners.10 For every Joint Strike Fighter Japan buys,
the United States can deploy one less to northeast Asia.

Given the diplomatic nature of these security partnerships, the
Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs focuses these
activities, regulates the defense trade and arms transfers to reinforce
the military capabilities of friends, allies, and coalition partners,
and ensures that the transfer of U.S.-origin defense equipment and
technology supports U.S. national security interests. Further, the
Bureau promotes regional security through bilateral and multilateral
cooperation and dialogue, as well as through the provision of security
assistance to friendly countries and international peacekeeping efforts.
The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military balances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to Saudi
Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., South Korea), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old FARC insurgency). Historically, Israel has been
the largest recipient of security assistance and its neighbor Egypt
benefited from its recognition of Israel and the Camp David Accords.11
Given its proximity to the United States and challenges with drug
trafficking organizations, Mexico has recently emerged as a top
recipient of security assistance. Given the history of American military
interventions in Mexico, this has required new efforts to build trust to
reassure the government that it seeks to strengthen it and not undermine
it.12

One reason the United States concentrates assistance on just a few
countries is to promote particular countries as regional leaders. In
practice, this means that Jordan hosts an international special
operations exercise, peace operations training center, and an
international police training center. Or in Latin America, Colombia
provides helicopter training for regional militaries and El Salvador
hosts a regional peacekeeping institute, attracting military personnel
from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Given the significant
U.S. investment in Afghanistan's military and police training
infrastructure, it is likely that Afghanistan could eventually host
regional training if the insurgency subsides to acceptable levels. [This
approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also
**[reduces]{.mark}** the need for American [**presence** and the
**negative attention** it]{.mark} sometimes
[generates]{.mark}]{.underline}. We see the benefits of this today where
U.S.-trained Colombian pilots are training Mexican pilots in Colombia.

**\[Table 1: Top Recipients of U.S. International Assistance (Account
150) OMITTED\]**

In addition to the Department of State budget for security assistance,
the [**Defense** Department]{.underline} directly funds security
assistance through section 1206/7 and other command funds such as
Commander's Emergency Response Program. This [**authority** did provoke
more **concern** about **militarizing fo**reign **po**licy; **however**,
this **only** makes up]{.underline} about \$1 billion annually, which is
[**less than 15 percent** of **security assistance** funded by the
**State** Department. Further, U.S. **ambassadors must approve all
programs**]{.underline}. Thus, [the Department of **State exerts
considerable control of programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels** through the embassy country team]{.underline}.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE MILITARY

With national security focused on weak states and persistent security
concerns among stable allies like South Korea, the U.S. military has
been changing over the last 20 years from a force of confrontation to
one of cooperation. [The military has learned that partnership is better
than clientism and is adapting its command structure once optimized for
waging major combat to one that is focused on conflict prevention. There
is **still a tremendous warfighting capability** in the U.S. military,
but coalition warfare is the norm and developing compatible warfighting
partners is a key goal of this cooperative strategy]{.underline}. In
some sense, [this **[turns the idea of militarization]{.mark} of
fo**reign **po**licy **[on its head]{.mark}**; the [Pentagon is **being
demilitarized**]{.mark} and valued for its ability to impart military
capabilities to U.S. partners]{.underline}.

Given the current structure of the international system and
technological advances, the United States does not need partners in the
same way as it did in the past where they provided direct benefits
through coaling stations, maintenance facilities, or large bases. While
the number of forward bases is still substantial, the number of forward
deployed forces are greatly reduced. More importantly, the nature of the
presence has changed; the United States aspires to create true partners
that can confront their own threats to internal stability (e.g.,
assistance to Colombia's military) or alleviate security dilemmas (e.g.,
future basing in Australia). It also seeks to foster independence by
training and equipping militaries to support the global demand for
peacekeepers.14 The United States certainly gets increased access to
countries around the world through these programs, but given the
overwhelming military dominance of the United States, it does not abuse
these relationships or ignore seemingly insignificant states. Instead,
it seeks to create partners where sovereignty is respected and all
parties derive benefits. The latest example of this is U.S. withdrawal
from Iraq as dictated by a U.S.-Iraqi agreement.

[While the Defense Department's capacity certainly explains why
international assistance missions **increasingly have a military face**,
it is also essential to understand that **there is a global demand** for
U.S. security assistance. The **Defense** Department **has recognized
that there are limits to what it can do**; the military **wants** and
needs **partners** from **across** the **government**, **allies** and
**private organizations**. Unfortunately, these ideas
remain]{.underline} stunted [\[**overlooked**\] in the broader foreign
policy community that gets **easily overwhelmed by the size of the
Defense Department's resources**. For critics, U.S. military activities
in permissive environments bring old memories of invasion or coup. For
them, U.S. foreign policy is on a dangerous militarization
path]{.underline}. While that part of U.S. military history is real and
still resonates in many parts of the world, [[it is **wrong**]{.mark} to
overlook the changes that have occurred over the last two decades.
Further, it is wrong to overlook the significant demands developed
countries place on the United States]{.underline}.

#### No impact -- wouldn't escalate

**Quinlan 9** Michael Quinlan, former British defence strategist and
former Permanent Under-Secretary of State, *Thinking About Nuclear
Weapons*, 2009, p.63-69 /GoGreen!

Even if initial nuclear use did not quickly end the fighting, [the
supposition of inexorable momentum in a]{.underline} [developing
exchange, with each side rushing to [**overreaction** amid]{.mark}
confusion and [uncertainty, is **implausible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It
fails to consider what the situation of the decisionmakers would really
be. **[Neither side]{.mark}** could **[want
escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both would be appalled at what was
going on. [Both would be desperately look]{.underline}ing [for
signs]{.underline} that [the other was ready to]{.underline} call a
[halt.]{.underline} Both, given the capacity for evasion or concealment
which modern delivery platforms and vehicles can possess, could have in
reserve significant forces invulnerable enough not to entail use-or-lose
pressures. (It may be more open to question, as noted earlier, whether
newer nuclear-weapon possessors can be immediately in that position; but
it is within reach of any substantial state with advanced technological
capabilities, and attaining it is certain to be a high priority in the
development of forces.) As a result, [neither side can have any
predisposition to suppose, in an ambiguous situation of fearful risk,
that the right course when in doubt is to go on copiously launching
weapons]{.underline}. And **[none of this analysis rests
on]{.underline}** [any **presumption of** highly subtle or pre-concerted
**rationality**. The rationality required is plain.]{.underline} The
argument is reinforced if we consider the possible reasoning of an
aggressor at a more dispassionate level. Any substantial nuclear armoury
can inflict destruction outweighing any possible prize that aggression
could hope to seize. A state attacking the possessor of such an armoury
must therefore be doing so (once given that it cannot count upon
destroying the armoury pre-emptively) on a judgement that the possessor
would be found lacking in the will to use it. If the attacked possessor
used nuclear weapons, whether first or in response to the aggressor\'s
own first use, this judgement would begin to look dangerously
precarious. [There must be at least a **substantial possibility** of the
aggressor leaders\' concluding that their initial judgement had been
**mistaken**---that the risks were]{.underline} after all [greater than
whatever prize they had been seeking, and that for their own country\'s
survival they must call off the aggression]{.underline}. [**[Deterrence
planning]{.mark}** such as that [of **NATO**]{.mark} was directed [in
the first place]{.mark} to **[preventing]{.mark} the initial
[misjudgement]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} in the second, **[if]{.mark} it
were [nevertheless made]{.mark}**, to **[compelling]{.mark}** such a
**[reappraisal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The former aim had to have
primacy, because it could not be taken for granted that the latter was
certain to work. But there was no ground for assuming in advance, for
all possible scenarios, that the chance of its working must be
negligible. [An aggressor state would itself be at huge risk if nuclear
war developed, as its leaders would know.]{.underline} It may be argued
that a policy which abandons hope of physically defeating the enemy and
simply hopes to get him to desist is pure gamble, a matter of who blinks
first; and that the political and moral nature of most likely
aggressors, almost ex hypothesis, makes them the less likely to blink.
One response to this is to ask what is the alternative---it can only be
surrender. But a more positive and hopeful answer lies in the fact that
the criticism is posed in a political vacuum. Real-life conflict would
have a political context. The context which concerned NATO during the
cold war, for example, was one of defending vital interests against a
postulated aggressor whose own vital interests would not be engaged, or
would be less engaged. Certainty is not possible, but a clear asymmetry
of vital interest is a legitimate basis for expecting an asymmetry,
credible to both sides, of resolve in conflict. That places upon
statesmen, as page 23 has noted, the key task in deterrence of building
up in advance a clear and shared grasp of where limits lie. That was
plainly achieved in cold-war Europe. 11 vital interests have been
defined in a way that is clear, and also clearly not overlapping or
incompatible with those of the adversary, a credible basis has been laid
for the likelihood of greater resolve in resistance. [It
was]{.underline} also sometimes [suggested]{.underline} by critics [that
whatever might be indicated by theoretical discussion of]{.underline}
[political will and interests, the military environment of nuclear
warfare]{.underline}---particularly difficulties of communication and
control---[would drive escalation with overwhelming probability to the
limit]{.underline}. [But it is obscure why matters should be regarded as
inevitably so for every possible level and setting of action. Even if
the **history** of war suggested (as it **scarcely** does) that military
decision-makers]{.underline} are mostly apt to [work on the principle
\'When in doubt, **lash out**\', the nuclear revolution creates an
utterly new situation]{.underline}. The pervasive reality, always plain
to both sides during the cold war, is \'If this goes on to the end, we
are all ruined\'. [Given that inexorable escalation would mean
catastrophe for both, it would be perverse to suppose them permanently
incapable of framing arrangements which avoid it.]{.underline} As page
16 has noted, NATO gave its military commanders no widespread delegated
authority, in peace or war, to launch nuclear weapons without specific
political direction. [Many types of weapon moreover had **physical
safeguards** such as PALs incorporated to reinforce **organizational**
ones. There were multiple **communication** and **control** systems for
passing information, orders, and prohibitions.]{.underline} Such systems
could not be totally guaranteed against disruption if at a fairly
intense level of strategic exchange---which was only one of many
possible levels of conflict--- an adversary judged it to be in his
interest to weaken political control. It was far from clear why he
necessarily should so judge. Even then, however, it remained possible to
operate on a general fail-safe presumption: no authorization, no use.
That was the basis on which NATO operated. If it is feared that the
arrangements which a nuclear-weapon possessor has in place do not meet
such standards in some respects, the logical course is to continue to
improve them rather than to assume escalation to be certain and
uncontrollable, with all the enormous inferences that would have to flow
from such an assumption. The likelihood of escalation can never be 100
per cent, and never zero. Where between those two extremes it may lie
can never be precisely calculable in advance; and even were it so
calculable, it would not be uniquely fixed---it would stand to vary
hugely with circumstances. That there should be any risk at all of
escalation to widespread nuclear war must be deeply disturbing, and
decision-makers would always have to weigh it most anxiously. But a pair
of key truths about it need to be recognized. The first is that the risk
of escalation to large-scale nuclear war is inescapably present in any
significant armed conflict between nuclear-capable powers, whoever may
have started the conflict and whoever may first have used any particular
category of weapon. The initiator of the conflict will always have
physically available to him options for applying more force if he meets
effective resistance. If the risk of escalation, whatever its degree of
probability, is to be regarded as absolutely unacceptable, the necessary
inference is that a state attacked by a substantial nuclear power must
forgo military resistance. It must surrender, even if it has a nuclear
armoury of its own. But the companion truth is that, as page 47 has
noted, the risk of escalation is an inescapable burden also upon the
aggressor. [The exploitation of that burden is the crucial route, if
conflict does break out, for managing it to a tolerable outcome---the
only route, indeed, intermediate between surrender and holocaust, and so
the necessary basis for deterrence beforehand.]{.underline} The working
out of plans to exploit escalation risk most effectively in deterring
potential aggression entails further and complex issues. It is for
example plainly desirable, wherever geography, politics, and available
resources so permit without triggering arms races, to make provisions
and dispositions that are likely to place the onus of making the bigger
and more evidently dangerous steps in escalation upon the aggressor who
wishes to maintain his attack, rather than upon the defender. (The
customary shorthand for this desirable posture used to be \'escalation
dominance\'.) These issues are not further discussed here. But
addressing them needs to start from acknowledgement that there are in
any event no certainties or absolutes available, no options guaranteed
to be risk-free and cost-free. Deterrence is not possible without
escalation risk; and its presence can point to no automatic policy
conclusion save for those who espouse outright pacifism and accept its
consequences. Accident and **[Miscalculation]{.underline}** Ensuring the
safety and security of nuclear weapons plainly needs to be taken most
seriously. Detailed information is understandably not published, but
such direct evidence as there is suggests that it always has been so
taken in every possessor state, with the inevitable occasional failures
to follow strict procedures dealt with rigorously. [Critics]{.underline}
have nevertheless from time to time [argued that the possibility of
accident involving]{.underline} [nuclear weapons is]{.underline} so
[substantial]{.underline} that it must weigh heavily in the entire
evaluation of whether war-prevention structures entailing their
existence should be tolerated at all. Two sorts of scenario are usually
in question. The first is that of a single grave event involving an
unintended nuclear explosion---a technical disaster at a storage site,
for example, or the accidental or unauthorized launch of a delivery
system with a live nuclear warhead. The second is that of some
event---perhaps such an explosion or launch, or some other mishap such
as malfunction or misinterpretation of radar signals or computer
systems---initiating a sequence of response and counter-response that
culminated in a nuclear exchange which no one had truly intended. [No
event that is physically possible can be said to be of absolutely **zero
probability**]{.underline} (just as at an opposite extreme it is absurd
to claim, as has been heard from distinguished figures, that
nuclear-weapon use can be guaranteed to happen within some finite future
span despite not having happened for over sixty years). [But human
affairs cannot be managed to the standard of]{.underline} either zero or
total [probability]{.underline}. [We have to assess levels
between]{.underline} those [**theoretical limits and weigh their
reality** and implications against other factors, in security planning
as in everyday life. There have]{.underline} certainly
[been]{.underline}, across the decades since 1945, many known
[**accidents** involving nuclear weapons,]{.underline} from transporters
skidding off roads to bomber aircraft crashing with or accidentally
dropping the weapons they carried (in past days when such carriage was a
frequent feature of readiness arrangements---it no longer is). A few of
these accidents may have released into the nearby environment highly
toxic material. [**None**]{.underline} however has [entailed a nuclear
detonation]{.underline}. Some commentators suggest that this reflects
bizarrely good fortune amid such massive activity and deployment over so
many years. [A]{.underline} more [rational deduction from the facts of
this long experience would however be that the **[probability]{.mark}**
of any accident triggering a nuclear explosion [is **extremely
low**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It might be further noted that the
[mechanisms needed to set off such an explosion]{.underline} [are
technically demanding, and that]{.underline} in a large number of ways
[the past sixty years have seen extensive **improvements in safety**
arrangements for both the design and the handling of
weapons]{.underline}. It is undoubtedly possible to see respects in
which, after the cold war, some of the factors bearing upon risk may be
new or more adverse; but some are now plainly less so. The years which
the world has come through entirely without accidental or unauthorized
detonation have included early decades in which knowledge was sketchier,
precautions were less developed, and weapon designs were less ultra-safe
than they later became, as well as substantial periods in which weapon
numbers were larger, deployments more widespread and diverse, movements
more frequent, and several aspects of doctrine and readiness
arrangements more tense. [Similar considerations apply to the hypothesis
[of nuclear war being **mistakenly triggered**]{.mark} by false
alarm]{.underline}. Critics again point to the fact, as it is
understood, of numerous occasions when initial steps in alert sequences
for US nuclear forces were embarked upon, or at least called for, by
indicators mistaken or misconstrued. In none of these instances, it is
accepted, did matters get at all near to nuclear launch---extraordinary
good fortune again, critics have suggested. But [[the]{.mark} rival and
[more logical inference from **hundreds of events**]{.mark} stretching
[over **sixty years**]{.mark} of experience presents itself once more:
that the **probability** of]{.underline} initial [misinterpretation
leading]{.underline} far [towards mistaken launch is **remote**.
Precisely because any nuclear-weapon possessor recognizes the vast
gravity of any launch,]{.underline} [release sequences have many steps,
and human decision is repeatedly interposed as well as capping the
sequences.]{.underline} [To convey that because a first
step]{.underline} was prompted [the world]{.underline} somehow [came
close to accidental nuclear war is **wild hyperbole**, rather like
asserting, when a tennis champion has lost his opening service game,
that he was nearly beaten in straight sets]{.underline}. [History anyway
scarcely offers any ready example of major war started by accident even
before the nuclear revolution imposed an **order-of-magnitude** increase
in caution.]{.underline} It was occasionally conjectured that nuclear
war might be triggered by the real but accidental or [unauthorized
launch]{.underline} of a strategic nuclear-weapon delivery system in the
direction of a potential adversary. No such launch is known to have
occurred in over sixty years. [The probability]{.underline} of it
[is]{.underline} therefore [very low. [But **even if it did**]{.mark}
happen, the **[further]{.mark} hypothesis** of its initiating a [general
**nuclear exchange**]{.mark} is far-fetched. It **[fails to
consider]{.mark} the [real]{.mark} situation of
[decision-makers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as pages 63-4 have brought out.
[The notion that cosmic holocaust might be mistakenly precipitated in
this way belongs to science fiction.]{.underline}

#### No readiness decline

\*added \[overlooked\]

With dozens of treaty allies and a strategic priority of promoting the
sovereignty of weak states, [the U.S. **[military]{.mark}** has been
gradually **[shifting]{.mark}** from a force designed for confrontation
[to]{.mark} one intended to promote international
**cooperation**]{.underline}. To be sure, the U.S. military retains a
technical and doctrinal advantage as a warfighting entity. However, over
the past two decades, the military has been incorporating new
organizations, doctrine, and training to prioritize efforts to prevent
war [through **[security]{.mark} force
[assistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has shifted focus to weak
states where sub-national (e.g., gangs in Central America) and
trans-national security challenges (e.g., al-Qa'ida) jeopardize
sovereignty and regional stability.1 Consequently, countries such as the
Philippines, Georgia, Colombia, Uganda, and Pakistan have requested
security assistance from the United States. While level of support
varies, U.S. forces are enabling partner countries to combat challenges
that threaten their own stability.

[This shift in focus has **raised concerns** about the
"**militarization** of U.S. **fo**reign **po**licy,"]{.underline} which
began in the 1990s with the recognition that combatant commanders are as
much policy entrepreneurs as they are war fighters.2 Generals like Tony
Zinni or Wesley Clark epitomized the new breed of warrior-diplomat who
directly engaged with foreign heads of state.3 Far from rogue generals,
these military leaders were directed by President Bill Clinton to engage
with the world and promote security by assisting partners and assuring
allies in a security environment freed from the Cold War dynamic.
President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama continued the
practice of using the military to assist almost every government of the
world. As Administrations from both parties came to value the military's
capabilities in peace and war, [some contended that defense overshadowed
(if not displaced) traditional diplomacy and development
efforts]{.underline}.4 Within defense circles, [[critics assumed]{.mark}
that helping weak states **[jeopardized]{.mark}** American [**military
dominance** and **undercut preparations for major
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 More recently, [critics highlight that in
an era of declining budgets, the]{.underline} United States [military
cannot afford nor overcome **unintended consequences** of attempting to
be a "global force for good."]{.underline}6 These are valid concerns,
**[[but]{.underline}]{.mark}** the United States shows no signs of
retreating from a global leadership role and instead seeks partnerships
as a key component of U.S. strategy.

With shared challenges of terrorism and nuclear proliferation, and
shared goals of development and protecting human security, there are
unprecedented levels of international cooperation to share information,
target terrorists, and provide governments the tools they need to
confront national threats before they become regional ones. This is on
display in Afghanistan where 50 countries operate under the ISAF flag,
or in the Indian Ocean where 27 countries operate as Combined Maritime
Forces. At the center of the coalitions is a U.S.-sponsored framework to
enable partners to contribute to international security.

President Barack Obama intends to continue the American tradition of
enabling partners throughout the globe. As he noted in his second
inaugural address, "America will remain the anchor of strong alliances
in every corner of the globe. And we will renew those institutions that
extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad. For no one has a greater
stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation." [By [training
and equipping]{.mark} other militaries, the goal is to **reduce** U.S.
American **military presence internationally** and]{.underline} allow
others to provide for their own security. [This [has **positive
benefits**]{.mark}]{.underline} not only for the U.S. defense budget
(e.g., an Afghan soldier costs hundreds per month compared to an
American soldier who costs thousands per month), but also [[for
**international security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. While my earlier book
Exporting Security explains why the United States assists governments
from Afghanistan to Zambia, an overlooked area is security assistance
provided to developed countries.

CAPACITY MATTERS

As France recently learned in Mali, while it has capable ground forces
and aircraft, it has limited ability to sustain these forces just 2,000
miles from home. To support its foreign policy agenda, France needed the
United States Air Force to fly its forces and refuel its attack
aircraft. As the operation continues, the United States will probably
provide intelligence for French and African forces as they shift to
stability operations.

Counterterrorism can certainly explain U.S. intervention in Mali;
however, enabling French success explains the timeline. More
importantly, the case of U.S.-supported French intervention in Mali is
illustrative of the role the United States plays in supporting developed
countries. France is the latest developed country to need U.S.
assistance, but requests like this are common. This is true for almost
every one of the 50 countries serving in Afghanistan today, as it was
true with European countries in the Balkans, Australian forces in East
Timor, and British forces in West Africa. These examples highlight that
the foreign policy goals of many developed countries exceed their
military capacity, which requires them to rely on the U.S. military for
assistance. As developed countries' defense budgets fall further,
reliance on the United States is going to increase. This remains a
decades-old frustration. Most recently, the NATO Secretary General
Anders Fogh Rasmussen said, "There is a lower limit on how little we can
spend on defense, while living up to our responsibilities.\"7

Pragmatically, the United States would like its partners to do more, but
shared challenges and limited budgets will reinforce the value of
American logistics, combat experience, and intelligence capacity.
Further, American support of other countries reinforces the treaty
arrangements with 27 NATO countries and five Asian countries. Twenty
years ago, there seemed to be little relevance to these treaties and
security arrangements, let alone a rationale for invoking them or
expanding them. Yet, the opposite occurred. NATO increased its
membership three times from 16 to 19 in 1999, again to 26 in 2006, and
again to 28 in 2009. At the same time the number of NATO members
increased, NATO changed from its traditional mission of territorial
defense to one of global security engagement. With each expansion, new
members require training and equipping to NATO standards. With each new
operation, NATO countries require access to U.S. intelligence, critical
technology, and global logistics.

In addition to formal treaties of alliance, an additional dozen
countries are offered protection under the U.S. security umbrella either
by law, such as the Taiwan Relations Act or by policy such as United
States' support for Israel.8 These protections include provisions to
train and equip their militaries. Another dozen countries are offered
special security provisions through Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status.
MNNA does not confer a mutual defense relationship, but the largely
symbolic act implies a close working relationship with another
country\'s defense forces.9 It is more akin to a preferred buyer's
program allowing countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea access
to advanced weapons systems. With weapons purchases also come long-term
training and maintenance contracts. From a U.S. perspective, it has a
comparative advantage in defense exports; strategically, programs like
these are intended to overcome the free-rider problem the United States
faces with its partners.10 For every Joint Strike Fighter Japan buys,
the United States can deploy one less to northeast Asia.

Given the diplomatic nature of these security partnerships, the
Department of State's Bureau of Political-Military Affairs focuses these
activities, regulates the defense trade and arms transfers to reinforce
the military capabilities of friends, allies, and coalition partners,
and ensures that the transfer of U.S.-origin defense equipment and
technology supports U.S. national security interests. Further, the
Bureau promotes regional security through bilateral and multilateral
cooperation and dialogue, as well as through the provision of security
assistance to friendly countries and international peacekeeping efforts.
The overall goals of security assistance include creating favorable
military balances of power (e.g., selling weapons and training to Saudi
Arabia to balance Iran), advancing areas of mutual defense or security
arrangements (e.g., collaborating with Japan on missile defense
technology), building allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations (e.g., South Korea), and
preventing crisis and conflict (e.g., facilitating Colombia's success
against the decades-old FARC insurgency). Historically, Israel has been
the largest recipient of security assistance and its neighbor Egypt
benefited from its recognition of Israel and the Camp David Accords.11
Given its proximity to the United States and challenges with drug
trafficking organizations, Mexico has recently emerged as a top
recipient of security assistance. Given the history of American military
interventions in Mexico, this has required new efforts to build trust to
reassure the government that it seeks to strengthen it and not undermine
it.12

One reason the United States concentrates assistance on just a few
countries is to promote particular countries as regional leaders. In
practice, this means that Jordan hosts an international special
operations exercise, peace operations training center, and an
international police training center. Or in Latin America, Colombia
provides helicopter training for regional militaries and El Salvador
hosts a regional peacekeeping institute, attracting military personnel
from countries throughout the Western Hemisphere. Given the significant
U.S. investment in Afghanistan's military and police training
infrastructure, it is likely that Afghanistan could eventually host
regional training if the insurgency subsides to acceptable levels. [This
approach not only strengthens key partners, but it also **reduces** the
need for American **presence** and the **negative attention** it
sometimes generates]{.underline}. We see the benefits of this today
where U.S.-trained Colombian pilots are training Mexican pilots in
Colombia.

**\[Table 1: Top Recipients of U.S. International Assistance (Account
150) OMITTED\]**

In addition to the Department of State budget for security assistance,
the [**Defense** Department]{.underline} directly funds security
assistance through section 1206/7 and other command funds such as
Commander's Emergency Response Program. This [**authority** did provoke
more **concern** about **militarizing fo**reign **po**licy; **however**,
this **only** makes up]{.underline} about \$1 billion annually, which is
[**less than 15 percent** of **security assistance** funded by the
**State** Department. Further, U.S. **ambassadors must approve all
programs**]{.underline}. Thus, [the Department of **State exerts
considerable control of programs at both budgetary and implementation
levels** through the embassy country team]{.underline}.

CHANGING ROLE OF THE MILITARY

With national security focused on weak states and persistent security
concerns among stable allies like South Korea, the U.S. military has
been changing over the last 20 years from a force of confrontation to
one of cooperation. [The military has learned that partnership is better
than clientism and is adapting its command structure once optimized for
waging major combat to one that is focused on conflict prevention.
[There is **still a tremendous warfighting capability** in the U.S.
military, but **coalition warfare is the norm** and
**developing**]{.mark} **compatible [warfighting partners]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} a **[key]{.mark}** goal of this cooperative
strategy]{.underline}. In some sense, [this **turns the idea of
militarization of fo**reign **po**licy **on its head**; the Pentagon is
**being demilitarized** and valued for its ability to impart military
capabilities to U.S. partners]{.underline}.

Given the current structure of the international system and
technological advances, the United States does not need partners in the
same way as it did in the past where they provided direct benefits
through coaling stations, maintenance facilities, or large bases. While
the number of forward bases is still substantial, the number of forward
deployed forces are greatly reduced. More importantly, the nature of the
presence has changed; the United States aspires to create true partners
that can confront their own threats to internal stability (e.g.,
assistance to Colombia's military) or alleviate security dilemmas (e.g.,
future basing in Australia). It also seeks to foster independence by
training and equipping militaries to support the global demand for
peacekeepers.14 The United States certainly gets increased access to
countries around the world through these programs, but given the
overwhelming military dominance of the United States, it does not abuse
these relationships or ignore seemingly insignificant states. Instead,
it seeks to create partners where sovereignty is respected and all
parties derive benefits. The latest example of this is U.S. withdrawal
from Iraq as dictated by a U.S.-Iraqi agreement.

[While the Defense Department's capacity certainly explains why
international assistance missions **increasingly have a military face**,
it is also essential to understand that **there is a global demand** for
U.S. security assistance. The **Defense** Department **has recognized
that there are limits to what it can do**; the military **wants** and
needs **partners** from **across** the **government**, **allies** and
**private organizations**. Unfortunately, these ideas
remain]{.underline} stunted [\[**overlooked**\] in the broader foreign
policy community that gets **easily overwhelmed by the size of the
Defense Department's resources**. For critics, U.S. military activities
in permissive environments bring old memories of invasion or coup. For
them, U.S. foreign policy is on a dangerous militarization
path]{.underline}. While that part of U.S. military history is real and
still resonates in many parts of the world, [[it is **wrong**]{.mark} to
overlook the changes that have occurred over the last two decades.
Further, it is wrong to overlook the significant demands developed
countries place on the United States]{.underline}.

#### No impact to readiness

**George 99** James L. George, former congressional professional staff
member for national security affairs, "Is Military Readiness Overrated?"
CATO, 5-27-1999,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/is-military-readiness-overrated>
/GoGreen!

Military readiness promises to be a major issue when Congress marks up a
defense bill later this year. Some members of Congress are already using
readiness as a reason to increase funding in the emergency spending bill
for the war in Yugoslavia. Most experts cite the initial stages of the
Korean War and the Hollow Force of the late 1970s as cautionary examples
of being ill-prepared. A closer look at both those examples, however,
shows that they really had little to do with readiness. Moreover, the
current crisis in Yugoslavia illustrates once again why
[[readiness]{.mark} may be **[overrated]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the
funds better spent elsewhere. Although [often **used as a generic term**
for all military capabilities]{.underline}, readiness---defined as the
ability to respond with appropriate force with little or no warning---is
only one of four pillars of military preparedness. The other pillars are
force structure, modernization and sustainability. Thus, [an effective
military force [depends on **much more**]{.mark} than just
readiness]{.underline}. Interestingly, [the two favorite examples cited
by readiness [alarmists **fail to prove their
case**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The performance of [Task Force
Smith]{.underline}, an ill-prepared battalion quickly sent to the front
and fairly [easily routed by the North Koreans]{.underline} during the
initial days of the Korean War, is often cited as the worst case. "No
More Task Force Smiths" has become a mantra for the Army. However,
critics of Task Force Smith fail to point out that U.S. commanders made
the most basic of military mistakes---including grossly underestimating
the enemy and sending TFS to an exposed position. When such blunders
occur, the end result will be the same whether it is an ill-trained Task
Force Smith in Korea or well-trained Marines in Beirut or elite Rangers
in Somalia. [Moreover, critics also fail to mention that barely a month
later the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [stabilized the
situation in South Korea]{.underline}, and in another month the Marines
conducted their famous Inchon Landing. In fact, without the Chinese
intervention, the United States would have won the Korean War a few
months after it began. Not bad for a U.S. force that was supposedly
ill-prepared. [Similarly, the Hollow Force of the late 1970s was not
primarily a readiness problem but a combination of many
factors---including]{.underline} a military characterized by low morale
after Vietnam, [serious **drug** and **racial problems**, the erroneous
induction of too many mentally **substandard recruits** and **low pay**
eroded further by high inflation]{.underline}. At the same time, [major
structural changes]{.underline} were transforming the U.S. military,
including the introduction of women into the regular forces, [the switch
from a draft to an all-volunteer force and the initiation of the Total
Force Concept that placed more reliance on the Reserves]{.underline}.
Given all of that turbulence, no wonder we had a Hollow Force. [**Often
[overlooked]{.mark}**, however, is **[how quickly]{.mark} those
[problems were solved]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In some cases, solutions
were found without spending a dime. For example, Chief of Naval
Operations Adm. Thomas Hayward instituted his "Not in my Navy" program
of zero tolerance for drugs. The drug problem was solved almost
overnight. The induction of too many mentally substandard recruits by
mistake which had lowered standards, was identified and corrected. That
correction solved most other personnel problems (and should be a warning
to people who want to lower standards today). Some members of Congress
are now using the crisis in Yugoslavia to get more funds for readiness
by arguing that the military is now stretched "too thin." (Congress
doubled President Clinton's request for \$6 billion in emergency
spending for the war.) In fact, the situation is quite the opposite.
[Leaving aside the question of whether the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should even be involved]{.underline} in
Yugoslavia, the new Clinton Doctrine, which does not plan to use ground
troops ( a position that is supported by many Republicans), limits the
stress placed on the military. Those [[decisions are]{.mark} all
deliberate [political actions that **have absolutely nothing to do with
readiness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Under a well-conceived strategy, even
a modestly capable force will probably perform well; but under a
**poorly conceived strategy**, even a force with the highest degree of
readiness will probably have serious problems]{.underline}. The
experiences of Task Force Smith and the Hollow Force, as well as the
invocation of a Clinton Doctrine that eschews the use of ground forces,
have major implications. More forces, for example, could be placed in
the reserves and scarce funds spent elsewhere. In addition, the military
could switch to what Sen. John McCain (R- Ariz.) has called "Tiered
Readiness:" a few forces would be kept on expensive ready status and be
augmented by reserve forces that could be mobilized if a substantial
threat to U.S. security arose. Military readiness is certainly
important, and no one is suggesting a return to the truly shallow force
of the late 1940s or the Hollow Force of the 1970s. But a close look at
those forces shows that their difficulties involved much more than just
poor readiness.

#### No impact to readiness

the Case for Complacency, Chapter 7, 02/17/2021, pg. 183-184.

Over the course of the last several decades,
[[alarmists]{.underline}]{.mark} have [often [focus]{.mark}ed
[on]{.mark} potential dangers presented by]{.underline} **[[rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as they came to be called in the 1990s.
These were led by such devils du jour as Nasser, Sukarno, Castro,
Gaddafi, Khomeini, Kim Il-sung, Saddam Hussein, Milosˇevic´, and
Ahmadinijad, [[all]{.mark} of whom have since]{.underline} **[[faded
into history's dustbin]{.underline}]{.mark}**.66 Today [the alarm has
been directed at]{.underline} **[Iran]{.underline}** as discussed in
Chapter 6 [and]{.underline} also at **[North Korea]{.underline}** as
discussed in this one. However, [neither country really threatens to
commit]{.underline} **[major direct military aggression]{.underline}**.
[Iran]{.underline}, in fact, has **[eschewed]{.underline}** [the
practice for several centuries]{.underline}.

Nonetheless, it might make some sense to maintain a capacity to
institute containment and deterrence efforts carried out in formal or
informal coalition with concerned neighboring countries -- and there are
quite a few of these in each case. However, the [**[military
requirements]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}]{.mark}
[effective]{.underline} **[[containment]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by their
neighbors]{.underline}, by [the United States, and]{.underline} by [the
broader world community are far from monumental and]{.underline} **[[do
not]{.underline}]{.mark}** necessarily [**[require]{.underline}** [the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [to
maintain]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[large
forces]{.underline}**]{.mark}-in-being [for the remote]{.underline}
[eventuality]{.underline}.

This is suggested by the experience with the Gulf War of 1991 when
military force was successfully applied to deal with a rogue venture --
the conquest by Saddam Hussein's Iraq of neighboring Kuwait. As noted
earlier, Iraq's invasion was rare to the point of being unique: it was
the only case since World War II in which one United Nations country has
invaded another with the intention of incorporating it into its own
territory. It scarcely appears, as laid out in Chapter 3, that Iraq's
pathetic forces required a large force to be thrown at them to decide to
withdraw: over a period of half a year, they did not erect anything
resembling an effective defensive system and, when the chips were down,
they proved to lack not only defenses, but strategy, tactics,
leadership, and morale as well.

[Countries]{.underline} **[opposed]{.underline}** [to provocative rogue
behavior do not need to have a]{.underline} **[large
force-in-being]{.underline}** [because there would be]{.underline}
[**[plenty of time]{.underline}** [to build]{.underline}]{.mark} [one
[up]{.mark}]{.underline} (should it come to that)
[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} other measures such as **[economic
[sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[diplomatic
forays]{.underline}**]{.mark} (including appeasement) [[fail]{.mark} to
persuade]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- Capacity

#### No [capacity]{.underline} -- and their personnel reform plank just means incompetent contractors

Title 10 vs. Title 22. [[State **perceives** authority to have
shifted]{.mark} in]{.underline} two basic
[[ways]{.underline}]{.mark}: 1) **[new DoD authorities]{.underline}**
(i.e. 2282) [[that **undercut State's lead**]{.mark} **responsibility**
for security assistance planning, and]{.underline} 2) [new DoD
authorities that extend beyond assistance to "armed forces," whereby DoD
now has authority to train **non-security forces**]{.underline}.
Generally speaking, [Defense sees this as [a **necessary**
evolution]{.mark} of the security assistance system [given]{.mark} the
[shifting]{.mark} nature of **[global threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Specifically, Defense sees Title 22 authorities as diplomatic in nature,
focused on relationship building as they have always been. By contrast,
[DoD sees the new Title 10 authorities as **[critical to filling real
capability gaps]{.mark}** that have a direct connection to U.S. national
security interests]{.underline}. Moreover, they cite, [[in a time
of]{.underline}]{.mark} significant budget constraints, increasing
pressure and need to rely on partners and coalitions in this way.
Finally, a very real connection exists between Title 10 and Title 22
authority growth and the relative level of activity (or inactivity)
between the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees. State has not
seen an authorizations bill in a decade, and the evolution of their
authorities has not kept pace with the evolution of Defense committees.
Many of the State authorities are relatively outdated, but their
committees have not been successful in moving State authorization
legislation through the system. Finally, and [above all, Defense
continues to stress the **[pragmatic urgency]{.mark}** of the current
situation, [and **State's inability**]{.mark} (due to lack of resources,
not incompetence) [to do **industrial scale security
coop**]{.mark}**eration** work]{.underline}. For instance, [Defense
personnel typically concede that it is undesirable for U.S. military
forces to be training civilian security personnel, but that [this is
**better than it not being done**, or]{.mark} the training being **[done
by incompetent contractors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- DoS Bureaucracy

#### DoS [internal turf wars]{.underline} gut solvency and thump the net benefit -- and reforms won't solve

/GoGreen!

**[[Who's in charge?]{.underline}]{.mark}** As the Obama administration
issued and then sought to implement Presidential Policy Directive 23 on
security sector assistance, and [as DoD's security assistance profile
has grown in recent years, debates both within and outside the
government have recently been asking the "who's in charge" question from
an interagency perspective]{.underline}. [Yet, the question
is]{.underline} equally---and perhaps
**[[more]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[**[important inside]{.mark}** the
**[State]{.mark}** Department itself]{.underline}.

[Responsibility for [**security assistance** is]{.mark} **muddled** and
**[disjointed]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs (PM) leads a planning process]{.underline} around FMF and
International Military Education and Training (IMET) programs, [but the
Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources makes final decisions about
funding allocations, and **[regional]{.mark} bureaus** exercise
substantial influence on how resources are divvied up within their
assigned regions]{.underline}. PM's power can seem to range somewhere
between facilitation [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} administration.

[Complicating matters further, other **[functional
bureaus]{.mark}**]{.underline}---such as the International Narcotics and
Law Enforcement Bureau and the Bureau for International Security and
Nonproliferation---[[control]{.mark} significant security assistance
[resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as program funding under the
International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) and the
Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining, and Related Programs (NADR)
accounts. Yet another major aid program, the Peacekeeping Operations
(PKO) account, is controlled by regional bureaus.

[[Developing **integrated**]{.mark}**, holistic [plans]{.mark}** for
**security assistance** across all these bureaus, which all report to
different undersecretaries, [is]{.mark} nearly
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are numerous countries in
which four or five different security assistance programs may be
[funding activities in the same general area (for example, maritime
security) [with]{.mark} **[competing objectives]{.mark}** and **[limited
awareness]{.mark}** of other activities]{.underline}. And, in the
current organization, [there is **[no one]{.mark}** sufficiently
empowered [to **arbitrate conflicts**]{.mark} between
bureaus]{.underline} below the level of deputy secretary, the #2
official in the department.

Even as the Trump administration considers major reforms to the State
Department bureaucracy, [this muddle is **[not expected to
improve]{.mark}** considerably. Disjointed, uncoordinated programming
[risks **strategic failure**, **redundancy**, and **waste**]{.mark}; the
question of who's in charge thus becomes critically
important]{.underline}. The committee would do well to press State
Department leaders to begin sorting out the answer.

### Deficit -- Conditionality

America spends billions each year on **[[security
coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** and assistance programs, but the
results do not match the investment. To help improve efficiencies, [the
Center for American Progress recently proposed
**[consolidating]{.mark}** all these programs [within]{.mark} the
**[State]{.mark}** Department]{.underline}.

[That would be [a **big mistake**]{.mark}, because it [would **minimize
the Pentagon's role**]{.mark} in shaping and directing security
assistance and]{.underline}, ultimately, the program's [[**military**
objectives]{.mark} would be **[subordinated]{.mark}** to State
Department interests]{.underline}, such as judicial reform and
humanitarian programs. Those are not the values by which such security
assistance programs should be solely judged.

Security sector assistance programs deliver arms, military training, and
other defense-related services to allies and partner nation governments
via grants, loans, credit, cash sales, or leasing. [By definition, these
programs [should **prioritize**]{.mark} national
**security**]{.underline}. To this end, reforms should enhance joint
State and Defense authorities so programs are evaluated in terms of
America's national strategic goals.

In the existing system, State consults with Defense on its security
assistance designs. Defense then implements State programs, as well as
its own security cooperation programs, such as multinational military
exercises and military training and advising.

The departments differ in the scope to which they apply security
assistance. [**Defense** programs target **[narrower]{.mark}** national
**[security objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as the Maritime
Security Initiative, launched in 2015 to expand maritime domain
awareness. [**[State]{.mark}**'s programs]{.underline}, such as the
Central America Regional Security Initiative, [[emphasize]{.mark}
broader]{.underline} regional stability and **[[humanitarian
goals]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Assistance programs can be better tailored to their objectives when
State shares directive authority and decision-making power with the
entity most relevant to each program's purpose]{.underline}. For
example, [[when the **objective** is **military
capacity-building**]{.mark}, the Defense Department should be an equal
partner]{.underline}; when the goal is justice system reform, the
Department of Justice should be a full partner.

Consider how the Philippines used American-sourced coast guard cutters
when responding to China's intrusions at Whitsun Reef earlier this year.
Given President Biden's emphasis on strategic competition with China,
strengthening partner nations to resist Beijing's maritime coercion
should be a no-brainer. In this context, State should ensure it ties the
objectives of its weapons sales program to Defense Department
priorities, such as improving maritime domain awareness, by enabling the
Philippines and, perhaps other countries, to increase patrols of
exclusive economic zones.

Another report published this month by the Center for a New American
Security rightly suggests that security assistance in the Middle East
should be guided by strategy and applied narrowly to military effects.
However, the report's recommendations are limited to counterterrorism
activities and a strategy of deprioritizing the Middle East in favor of
the Indo-Pacific. If [**[limiting]{.mark}** security assistance [to
**military purposes**]{.mark} would **[make programs more
effective]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a region of waning emphasis, it
stands to reason that [this should be the formative basis for all
security assistance programs]{.underline}, especially when strategy
calls for increased investment in the security capacities of partner
nations.

[Reforms to security assistance should push]{.underline} the agencies in
this direction, encouraging --- or compelling --- [State to design its
programs in closer coordination with the Pentagon and [in support
of]{.mark} Defense Department's **[operational needs]{.mark}**, such as
improving military forward presence, wartime [**resilience** and
**interoperability**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Congress should recognize and re-evaluate its role in these decision as
well, as legislative earmarks can limit State's directive agility and
responsiveness. But even the best-laid plans cannot succeed without
follow-through.

Specifically, this report calls for
**[[transferring]{.underline}]{.mark}** the following [programs and
funding [from]{.mark} the [**DOD** to]{.mark} the **[State]{.mark}**
Department]{.underline}:

The relatively newly created Section 333 train and equip authority,
which replicates the State Department's Foreign Military Financing (FMF)
authority

The DOD's security assistance authorities that focus on long-term
security force reform to the State Department, including the Afghanistan
Security Forces Fund, the Counter-Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
Train and Equip Fund, and the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative
fund

[This would result in a roughly \$7 billion transfer]{.underline},
significantly augmenting the State Department's budget and capacity to
guide security assistance policy.

[Putting the State Department back in charge of security assistance will
be a major reform and [will require **significant operational
changes**]{.mark} within the department, [as well as a **dramatic
expansion of**]{.mark} **its administrative
[capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This **will take time** to
implement]{.underline}]{.mark} and require significant reform within the
agency.
