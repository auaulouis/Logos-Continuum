military research**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The war in [[Ukraine prompts a **series of new R&D collaborations**

**[stirs]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}some academic
[**[controversy]{.underline}**]{.mark} in Europe

[The war in Ukraine moved]{.underline} directly [into the
lab]{.underline} this week, [[with]{.mark} western [governments
announcing]{.mark} a series of [new measures]{.mark} [to
coordinate]{.mark} their [military research]{.mark}]{.underline},
including on quantum technologies and hypersonic missiles.

[But the shift isn't without controversy]{.underline}, as some European
academics urged the EU to keep its civilian and defence research
separate.

[The military build-up took several steps, [with **NATO** announcing a
coordinated]{.mark}, multi-country research
[programme]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the US, Australia and UK setting
plans for expanded quantum, hypersonic and other joint weapons research.
It followed a NATO leaders' meeting last autumn in which the strategy
was set; but [[the **scale and scope** of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
detailed [[measures]{.mark} announced]{.underline} this week [[were
**massive**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

DIANA launch

Jens Stoltenberg, secretary general of NATO, announced this week that
the UK and Estonia will host a joint military R&D programme involving
research centres around the alliance. The Defence Innovation Accelerator
for the North Atlantic (DIANA) is expected to strengthen transatlantic
cooperation on defence technologies and procurement.

[[The]{.mark} innovation [accelerator will cover]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}projects in **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**rtificial
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, big data, **[[quantum
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nologies,
**[[biotech]{.underline}]{.mark}**nology, hypersonics and space. "The
goal of DIANA is to support deep technologies companies that contribute
to defence," said Estonian defence minister Kalle Laanet.

In the UK, Imperial College London will be the host organisation,
coordinating what the UK government called "deep tech test centres" for
military technologies, and a "virtual marketplace" to connect start-ups
with investors and procurers.

[The project is part of a broader NATO initiative to boost military
research cooperation, that will ultimately involve as many as 60
sites.]{.underline} On 6 April, Denmark's DTU research organisation said
it and partners had been chosen to set up a NATO testing centre in
Copenhagen for quantum technologies. Further announcements on other
sites to be included are expected in coming weeks.

AUKUS cooperation

About the same time as the NATO news, the White House announced on 5
April that US, UK and Australian leaders had agreed to "accelerate
investments to deliver generation-after-next quantum capabilities." The
R&D focus, it said, will be on "positioning, navigation and timing", in
trials over the next three years. Quantum sensors can provide
ultra-precise atomic clocks, to guide ships or missiles.

The AUKUS Quantum Arrangement, as they called it, is part of a broader
defence pact last year among the three nations in response to growing
western concerns about Russia and China. The initial step last year was
an agreement by the US and UK to supply nuclear-powered submarines to
Australia -- undercutting a rival French offer. But the latest
discussions, as the Australian prime minister visited Washington, shows
the three-way alliance widening to include other military technologies.

And separately from the overtly military news, on 5 April Finnish and US
officials signed a joint statement pledging cooperation on a long list
of quantum topics, including research, supply chains, education and
values. The statement focuses on quantum benefits to the economy and
society, and notably excludes mention of defence applications.

What role for Horizon Europe?

But [[the **rapid-fire string of**]{.mark} western [**announcements**
signals a **seismic shift** in]{.mark} how governments handle the
delicate question of [military]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}versus
civilian [[research]{.underline}]{.mark}. The European Commission is
planning to expand the use of research funds for 'dual-use' defence
technologies, but it's unclear whether money from Horizon Europe, its
€95.5 billion programme for civilian research, will actually end up
being spent on developing weapons.

### 2AC: No NATO Unity

#### Post-Ukraine unity is collapsing

**Lucas, 22** \-- Center for European Policy Analysis nonresident fellow

\[Edward Lucas, \"NATO Is Out of Shape and Out of Date,\" Foreign

[NATO Is Out of Shape and Out of Date]{.underline}

[With the bloc's unity over Ukraine showing cracks, NATO needs an
overhaul.]{.underline}

Is NATO brain-dead or back in business? Less than three years ago,
French President Emmanuel Macron famously diagnosed "the brain death of
NATO." Rhetoric aside, his point was fair at the time: Europe's dearth
of strategic thinking combined with the unpredictability of U.S. policy
under then-President Donald Trump spelled serious trouble for the Cold
War-era alliance.

Now, [all talk is of NATO's revival]{.underline} and resurgence.
Russia's war on Ukraine has given an urgent new relevance to the bloc's
core mission of territorial defense. NATO members appear to have found a
new unity of purpose, supplying Ukraine with weapons, reassessing the
threat from Russia, hiking defense budgets, and bolstering the security
of the alliance's eastern frontier. [But **[the
"honeymoon,"]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}in the words of Lithuanian
Foreign Minister Gabrielius Landsbergis, [[**was brief**. **As the war
drags on**, strains are showing]{.mark}, and the alliance is still
shaky.]{.underline}

It's true that NATO has come a long way. Only 14 years ago, the
alliance's top-secret threat assessment body, MC 161, was explicitly
prohibited by its political masters from even considering any military
danger from Russia in its scenarios. The pressure came not only from
notorious Russia-huggers such as Germany but also from the United
States, which was eager to keep east-west ties friendly. The Kremlin,
the conventional wisdom insisted, was a partner, not an enemy. As a
result, NATO's most vulnerable members---Poland and the Baltic states of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania---remained second-class allies. They were
in the bloc, but only on paper. There were no significant outside forces
on their territory, and the alliance expressly refrained from making
contingency plans to reinforce or even defend them in the event of
attack. Poland demanded such plans and was told that they could be drawn
up to defend the country against an attack by Belarus---but not by
Russia.

Since Russia's first attack on Ukraine in 2014, NATO plans and
deployments have become more serious. There are 1,000-strong tripwire
forces in the three Baltic states and a larger U.S. force in Poland.
Since the start of the invasion in February, that presence has increased
sharply. Moreover, two of the most advanced smaller military powers in
Europe, Finland and Sweden, are banging on the alliance's door. Assuming
objections from Turkey can been smoothed out, they will be members by
year's end. That will fundamentally change the military geography of
northeastern Europe.

Still more important is the stiffening of spines among the members.
Trump's much publicized distaste for NATO was based, in part, on the
European members' chronic underspending. At one point, the exasperated
U.S. leader even tried to present a bill to his German counterpart,
Chancellor Angela Merkel. Now, defense spending is rising across the
alliance. That makes NATO an easier sell in Washington, especially as
the case for U.S. engagement in European security is bolstered by the
war in Ukraine.

Germany, the most notorious laggard, is suddenly splurging money on its
decrepit armed forces---tanks that can't trundle, ships that can't go to
sea, and soldiers who exercise with broomsticks instead of guns. It has
agreed to meet NATO's defense spending benchmark of 2 percent of GDP,
set in 2006 and largely ignored thereafter. The latest country to
announce a big hike in defense spending is Spain, currently lagging at
barely 1 percent of GDP. The prime minister announced that this will
double by 2024. That sets the scene nicely for the NATO summit in the
Spanish capital later this month.

Yet [[look]{.underline}]{.mark} a little [more [closely, and the picture
is far less rosy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Notwithstanding its apparent
unity of purpose since the start of Russia's war, [NATO looks out of
shape and out of date.]{.underline} In the run-up to their summit, [the
[allies have been **furiously** haggling]{.mark} over]{.underline} the
[language]{.underline} in their new strategic concept, which will frame
the alliance's mission for the coming years and will be unveiled in
Madrid. What will it say about Russia? About China? What sacrifices and
risks are the member states really willing to accept? Are they willing
to pool sovereignty in order to streamline decision-making?

[Nothing]{.underline} in recent weeks [suggests]{.underline} that these
[questions will get clear answers]{.underline}. For starters, [the
30-strong alliance is unwieldy.]{.underline} In military terms, only a
handful of members matter---above all, the United States---but in
political terms, even little Luxembourg and Iceland get a voice. Worse,
the [political divides are huge. [Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan [is a semi-authoritarian
state that [flirts with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}and fumes
at what it considers European meddling over human rights.
[[Hungary]{.underline}]{.mark} under Prime Minister Viktor
[Orban]{.mark} [is]{.underline} taking a different but downward path,
fusing wealth and power into a new system of control at home and
[[undermining]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. and European [[attempts to put
pressure on Russia and China]{.mark}.]{.underline} Macron's relentless
posturing and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's foot-dragging create
constant obstacles and distractions. The two leader's weaknesses, on
glorious display since the start of the war, have already enriched the
language: Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while makronic in
Polish (and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as
"vacuous grandstanding while doing nothing."

Macron and Scholz corrode decision-making with their foibles and thus
place a big question mark over the alliance's credibility and cohesion.
Any threat or provocation from Russia is unlikely to be clear or
conveniently timed. More likely it will be something deliberately
ambiguous, such as a Russian drone that "accidentally" strays onto the
territory of a front-line state and hits a target. Some countries would
favor a tough response. Others would fear escalation and want dialogue.
Still others would take the ambiguity as a convenient excuse to do
nothing. Would the 30---soon to be 32---national representatives in the
North Atlantic Council, the alliance's deliberative body, really make a
speedy and tough decision on how to react? More likely, some of them
would plead for delay, diplomacy, and compromise. Those actually facing
the possibility of attack would be far more hawkish, preferring a sharp
military confrontation to even the smallest Russian victory. "Not one
inch, not one soul," a senior military figure from one of the Baltic
states, speaking anonymously, told me. "We have seen what they did in
Ukraine."

The [[political weaknesses are matched by military
ones]{.underline}]{.mark}. By far the most important country in the
alliance is the United States. The U.S. security guarantee to
Europe---with its threat of devastating conventional and, if necessary,
nuclear response to any attack---is the cornerstone of the alliance.
"All for one and one for all" sounds fine, but [nobody in the Kremlin
will tremble at the thought of Spanish, Dutch, or Canadian
displeasure]{.underline}. Yet the result of this is a colossal
dependence on U.S. capabilities, ranging from ammunition and spare parts
(of which European countries' stockpiles are notoriously skinny) to
military transports that move forces quickly and efficiently over long
distances. Even if Europe's new defense spending plans materialize, they
will not change the fact that only U.S. armed forces can move with the
scale and speed necessary to defend territory from a country like
Russia.

Conversely, the countries that most need defending---Estonia, Latvia,
and Lithuania---are the least able to bear the burden themselves. They
need advanced weapons, particularly for air and missile defense, that
they cannot afford themselves. The thin neck of land along the
Polish-Lithuanian border, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} so-called [[Suwalki
Gap, is particularly vulnerable to attack]{.underline}]{.mark} from
Russia's militarized Kaliningrad exclave and Belarus, from which Russia
attacked Ukraine. Poland and Lithuania both want a big U.S. military
presence---either a permanent base or a persistent rotation of
forces---to safeguard this strategic chokepoint.

Yet NATO command structures and planning do not fully reflect the
imbalance of forces between the United States and Europe. They rely on
the fiction that the European allies are more or less equal partners.
Even military lightweights need to have important-sounding jobs and
installations, making the North Atlantic Council the military version of
a parliament dividing out the pork.

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} resulting [[command structure
is]{.underline}]{.mark} like [a [tangled]{.mark} pile of
[spaghetti]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the Baltic region alone, NATO has
several multinational headquarters, one divisional headquarters split
between Latvia and Denmark, another divisional headquarters in Poland,
and a corps headquarters at a different location in Poland. Overall
responsibility for the defense of Europe is divided between three Joint
Forces Command headquarters in Naples, Italy; Brunssum, the Netherlands;
and Norfolk, Virginia. But the top U.S. military commander in Europe,
Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, is based at Supreme Headquarters Allied
Powers Europe in Mons, Belgium. A maritime strategy for the Baltic Sea
region has yet to be decided---which is just as well, because NATO has
yet to create a naval headquarters for the region. Nor has the alliance
drawn up real military plans for the reinforcement and defense of its
northeastern members, let alone decided who would actually provide the
forces and equipment in order to make them credible. Military mobility
is meant to be the responsibility of Joint Support and Enabling Command,
headquartered in Ulm, Germany, and originally set up as part of the
European Union's own defense policy.

A further problem is exercises: NATO does not conduct fully realistic,
large-scale rehearsals of how it would respond to a Russian attack. One
problem is that these are costly and disruptive. Another is that they
expose the huge weaknesses of some NATO members, which can cope with a
carefully scripted exercise but lack the ability to improvise. A third
reason is the fear, in some countries, that practicing war-fighting
would be provocative. Also lacking are detailed plans for fighting a war
against Russia, covering such issues as reinforcing of front-line
states, countering a Russian attack, regaining any temporarily occupied
territory, and---most of all---dealing with a nuclear or other
escalation. As a result, nobody is quite sure how anything would work in
a crisis. Instead, another assumption reigns: that in a crisis, the
United States would take over and do the heavy lifting on all
fronts---logistics, intelligence, and combat.

To be fair, NATO is working on these problems, and all of them are
fixable. But that does not mean that they are anywhere near being fixed.
Wishful thinking remains the alliance's besetting sin.

Worse, [[NATO is unprepared for]{.mark} the changing nature of [modern
war]{.mark}fare.]{.underline} Russia's old-style assault on Ukraine is
all too familiar. But the artillery bombardments and missile strikes
that are grinding down Ukraine's defenses are only part of the Kremlin's
arsenal. Its most effective weapons are nonmilitary: subversion,
diplomatic divide-and-rule tactics, economic coercion, corruption, and
propaganda. The most burning current example of nonmilitary warfare is
Russia's weaponizing of hunger. By blocking Ukraine's grain exports,
Russia has raised the specter of famine over millions of people,
including in volatile and fragile countries in North Africa and the
Middle East. Mass starvation is not just a humanitarian catastrophe, but
its consequences include political unrest and mass migration, a direct
threat to Europe. Yet NATO is ill-equipped to deal with this. It cannot
mandate more economical use of grain---for example, by feeding less to
livestock and stopping grain's conversion to fuel. It has no food
stockpiles to release to a hungry world. It cannot build new railways to
ship Ukrainian grain through other routes. Nor can it insure merchant
vessels that might---for a price---be willing to run Russia's Black Sea
blockade. NATO has little in-house expertise in countering Russian
disinformation and almost zero influence in African and other countries
susceptible to Kremlin narratives blaming the West for the food
shortages that are already starting now.

NATO could acquire these capabilities. Or it could regain them: During
the Cold War, the alliance had an economic warfare division and ran a
program called the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Controls to prevent the Soviet bloc from acquiring sensitive
technologies. But in the strategic timeout that followed the collapse of
the Soviet bloc, these agencies and their skill sets shriveled and died.

But as with NATO's military shortcomings, identifying the problems is
not the same as solving them. And given the bloc's unwieldy structure
and issues with key members, it might be wise to lower expectations
about NATO returning to Cold War levels of consistent readiness and
effectiveness. A more realistic vision for the alliance would be to
treat it as a framework for the most capable and threat-aware members to
form coalitions of the willing. These groupings already exist: The
British-led Joint Expeditionary Force, for example, is a 10-country
framework for military cooperation, chiefly aimed at enabling very rapid
deployments to the Nordic-Baltic region in the event of a crisis. France
has a similar venture, the European Intervention Initiative. The five
Nordic states have their own military club, called the Nordic Defence
Cooperation, while Poland has close bilateral ties with Lithuania. A
similar network of bilateral and multilateral ties would greatly
strengthen the alliance's floundering presence in the Black Sea and
other regions, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean.
These groupings would not supplant NATO but improve action and
interoperability on top of the alliance's established structures and
mechanisms.

The difficult and underlying question here is the role of the United
States. Europe is, in theory, big and rich enough to manage its own
defense. But its persistent political weakness prevents that. The
paradox is that only U.S. involvement makes NATO credible---yet
overdependence on the United States also undermines the alliance's
credibility, while stoking resentment in France and elsewhere. The task
for Washington is to encourage European allies to shoulder more of the
burden and start thinking strategically again, even as it retains the
superpower involvement that gives the alliance its decisive military
edge. That is entirely doable. But don't expect it to happen in
Madrid---or anytime soon.

#### Turkey blocking new members sabotages NATO unity

[[Erdogan **disrupts NATO unity**]{.underline}]{.mark} amid Putin's
threat to European security

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan negotiates political gains with NATO\'s
expansion

[[Internal NATO relations have become **increasingly strained**
following Turkey']{.underline}s]{.mark} apparent [[refusal to allow
Sweden and Finland in]{.underline}]{.mark}to the fold, with fellow NATO
member Greece becoming the latest European nation on Turkish President
Tayyip Erdogan\'s chopping block.

[Erdogan took a swing at Greek Prime Minister]{.underline} Kyriakos
[Mitsotakis]{.underline} this week when he accused him of attempting to
block a U.S. arms sale of F-16 fighter jets to Ankara.

\"There\'s no longer anyone called Mitsotakis in my book,\" he told
reporters following a Monday cabinet meeting.

The Turkish president also said he would refuse to meet his Greek
counterpart for a previously planned summit later this year.

Erdogan's comments came a week after the Greek prime minister met with
U.S. lawmakers on Capitol Hill and urged them to consider NATO's
security when making \"defense procurement decisions concerning the
eastern Mediterranean.\"

\"We are always open to dialogue. But there is only one framework we can
use to resolve our differences -- international law and the unwritten
principle of good neighborly relations,\" Mitsotakis told U.S.
lawmakers. \"The last thing that NATO needs at a time when our focus is
on helping Ukraine defeat Russia\'s aggression is another source of
instability on NATO\'s southeastern flank.\"

The Greek prime minister did not mention Erdogan or neighboring Ankara,
but his comments alluded to a long-standing spat with Turkey over
alleged airspace violations.

Turkey and Greece, both of whom are NATO members, have shared a complex
relationship for more than a century. But Athens and Ankara's latest
tiff amid Russia's aggression in Europe could spell trouble for the very
military alliance that Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to
see dismantled.

\"All nations act in their own self-interest, all the time,\" Michael
Ryan, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Europe and NATO,
told Fox News. \"\[Erdogan\] defines the Turkish self-interests and he
defines how they pursue it. And in this case, he views Turkey as a
rising regional power, and he is pushing hard in every direction to
certain Turkish prerogatives.\"

The NATO expert explained that the arms sale merely highlights several
dynamics at play that Erdogan is juggling.

Turkey\'s defenses have been lagging since Washington blocked Ankara
from purchasing U.S. F-35 warplanes in 2019 after it purchased the
Russian-made S-400 missile system.

The White House at the time said, \"The F-35 cannot coexist with a
Russian intelligence-collection platform that will be used to learn
about its advanced capabilities.\"

Turkey is looking to upgrade its air defense systems with modern U.S.
F-16 aircraft not only to bolster its military capabilities amid its
ongoing air disputes with Greece but to aid its operations in Syria.

\"It's a cat and mouse game,\" Ryan said. \"Congress really does have
something that the Turks want.\"

But he added that the \"Turks have something that Congress wants --
which is Sweden, Finland in NATO. That may be Erdogan's play all
along.\"

\"The U.S. can't have Erdogan calling the shots here,\" European policy
expert Nile Gardiner, director of The Heritage Foundation's Margaret
Thatcher Center for Freedom, told Fox News.

\"[All [NATO allies]{.mark} need to be able to work together. It
[**breaks down** if you have one or two]{.mark} countries]{.underline}
who [are]{.mark} [trying [to **derail**]{.mark} the future of [**the
alliance** -- **which is what Turkey is doing**]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
he added.

The Greek prime minister's veiled comments to U.S. lawmakers last week
may have been an attempt to dissuade Washington from securing an arms
sale with Turkey amid its NATO membership blockade.

Russia's war in Ukraine has renewed the weight of NATO's military
alliance, particularly with regard to its Article 5 stipulation that
says an attack on one country will trigger a united response from all 30
member nations.

Sweden and Finland formally requested to join NATO following Russia's
aggression in not only Ukraine but amid threats Moscow has issued
against other European nations.

NATO military commanders championed the move to include Stockholm and
Helsinki in the alliance and said it would bolster NATO defenses and
identify \"vulnerabilities\" in Europe's security.

But Turkey has used the opportunity to block the NATO bids over claims
that Sweden and Finland have housed individuals it considers terrorists.

\"[[The Turks are **undermining NATO** by taking this **reckless
stance**]{.underline}]{.mark},\" Gardiner warned. \"President Erdogan
has a clear choice between either helping NATO or weakening it, and he
needs to be on the right side of history here, instead of appeasing the
Russians.\"

Some foreign policy experts have suggested that [[Erdogan could be
acting as **Putin's \"Trojan horse\"** to]{.mark} strategically block
NATO's expansion and [**sow turmoil**]{.mark} within the
alliance.]{.underline}

But the former defense secretary for Europe and NATO rejected these
claims.

### 2AC: No Taiwan War

**No China-Taiwan war**

**Scobell and Stevenson-Yang, 3-4**

\[BY: Andrew Scobell, Ph.D.; Lucy Stevenson-Yang, United States
Institute of Peace, March 4, 2022, "China Is Not Russia. Taiwan Is Not
Ukraine."
<https://www.usip.org/publications/2022/03/china-not-russia-taiwan-not-ukraine>,
accessed 4-2-2022\]

China Is Not Russia Russia under Putin has repeatedly dispatched its
armed forces for combat missions overseas to a range of countries,
including Georgia, Syria and Ukraine, as well as conducted major
military interventions against other states, most recently Kazakhstan
(albeit at the invitation of that country's president). Moscow has also
actively supported armed groups and militias in some of these same
countries and others. **[Although China has also been active and
assertive in the use of its armed forces beyond its borders in recent
years[, Beijing has eschewed large-scale combat
operations.]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}Around its periphery, China
has engaged in provocations, confrontations and even violent clashes.
**[[But China, unlike Russia, has refrained from massive interventions,
invasions or occupations of other countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** since
it invaded Vietnam in 1979[. **[China's largest deployments of troops
overseas]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[in the post-Cold War era [have been
on U.N. Peacekeeping missions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Whereas Russia has
more than 20 military installations beyond its borders, to date, China
has only one official military base on foreign soil --- in Djibouti
(established in 2017) --- and a handful of other facilities it does not
formally acknowledge. Of course, Beijing has a history of using its
potent armed forces and muscular coercive apparatus within China's
borders to repress vigorously peaceful protesters, political dissidents
and disaffected ethnic minority peoples. The locations of these
operations include Beijing, Tibet and Xinjiang, as well as Hong Kong.
China has also not hesitated to employ armed force and a wide array of
coercive instruments around its periphery. This includes building roads
and bunkers in remote frontier areas of the high Himalayas along its
contested border with India and constructing artificial islands and
military installations in disputed waters of the South China Sea. In
recent years, China's armed forces have also engaged in deadly clashes
and violent confrontations with Indian army units along the disputed
Line of Actual Control and harassed and rammed the fishing boats and
coast guard vessels of Vietnam, the Philippines and other countries.
Putin appears to relish projecting the image of a strongman who is
routinely willing to thumb his nose at the rest of the world. By
contrast, **[Xi]{.underline}** --- at least to date --- **[has mainly
sought to cultivate a statesmanlike image on the global stage. At times
he has given speeches attempting to cast China as a more responsible,
less meddlesome and values-free version of the United States. And Xi has
invested a lot of time and resources in promoting a set of high-profile
international efforts intended to demonstrate that China is a
constructive and proactive great power.]{.underline}** Employing
positive rhetoric touting "win-win" solutions and aspirations to build a
"community with a shared future for mankind," China under Xi's
leadership has launched ambitious efforts such as the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. Putin, by
contrast, has made no real effort to offer an alternative to U.S. global
leadership beyond delivering vague grandiose declarations (often in
tandem with Xi) and has offered the world little in the way of economic
stimulus beyond the prospect of more energy exports and hype about the
Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU). Despite consisting of only a handful of
Soviet successor states, the EAEU is touted as Russia's answer to
China's BRI. In terms of geostrategic activism, Russia's major
multilateralist initiatives have tended to involve China. These include
the establishment of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in 2001 and
the formation of the BRICS grouping in 2010. The former is a security
community with a Central Asian focus consisting of Russia, China and
four Central and two South Asian states. The latter is a loose
association of some of the world's largest "emerging economies": Brazil,
Russia, India, China and South Africa. However, Moscow's most
significant geostrategic maneuver under Putin has been to strengthen
Russia's strategic partnership with China. Both Beijing and Moscow
insist that their relationship is not an alliance and their 2001 treaty
of friendship --- which was renewed in 2021 --- does not commit either
signatory to come to the defense of the other in case of military
conflict. Yet, the Sino-Russian relationship is a clearly consequential
alignment that has grown closer in recent years, particularly as their
respective relationships with the United States have deteriorated.
Russia's invasion of Ukraine has put China in a very uncomfortable
position: Beijing does not want to antagonize Moscow but neither does it
want to damage its relations with Washington and European capitals.
Consequently, China has equivocated in its statements and actions.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for peace but has stopped
short of condemning Russia or calling upon Moscow to withdraw its
military. The lengthy joint statement of February 4, 2022, issued by
Putin and Xi during the Russian leader's visit to Beijing on the eve of
the Winter Olympics, makes no mention at all of Ukraine --- and China
has pointedly abstained on all U.N. Security Council resolutions related
to Russia's invasion. Xi appears to have asked Putin to delay any
military action against Ukraine until after the Olympics. Russia's
invasion poses other difficulties for China both in terms of running
counter to Beijing's long espoused principles in foreign affairs and its
adverse impact on China's national interests in Ukraine. Russia's
actions clearly contradict China's cornerstone foreign policy principles
of noninterference in other countries' affairs and respecting
territorial integrity. Moreover, China has sizable economic investments
in Ukraine and is a good customer of Ukraine's armaments industry. In
2020, Ukraine signed the BRI cooperation agreement, which further
bolstered the economic relationship between the two countries and marked
Ukraine as an important partner in Beijing's signature foreign policy
and economic initiative. Taiwan Is Not Ukraine The fact that Ukraine is
not a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) was almost
certainly a decisive factor in Putin's calculus to invade Ukraine.
Russia's commander in chief knew that his invading forces would likely
not have to contend with the militaries of any other countries. And if
there were any lingering doubts in the Kremlin about the disposition of
the most powerful member of NATO, U.S. President Joe Biden stated
publicly that the United States would not send military forces to help
defend Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Biden administration has taken strong
steps to reinforce NATO allies in Eastern Europe and provide robust
military assistance to Ukraine. By contrast, **[[Xi and his Politburo
colleagues have long been convinced that Taiwan has the resolute support
of the world's most capable military. The People's Liberation
Army]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- as all branches of China's armed forces
are known --- **[[continues to assume that if it launches an invasion of
Taiwan, the U.S. military will swiftly and decisively
intervene.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The U.S.-Taiwan relationship, while
technically "unofficial" due to the One China policy, has strengthened
in recent years. On February 28, **[the Biden administration sent an
unofficial delegation of former U.S. defense and national security
officials to Taiwan as a signal to China of that commitment. It remains
true that the greatest deterrence to a massive Chinese military attack
on the island is Beijing's assumption that war with Taiwan also means a
war with the United States.]{.underline}** However, there is no formal
military alliance between the United States and Taiwan. The defense pact
binding Washington to Taipei was formally abrogated in 1979. So why is
Beijing convinced that Washington has an ironclad alliance-like
relationship with Taiwan? There are at least two reasons. First,
successive U.S. administrations have publicly committed themselves to
support Taiwan against Chinese aggression and have regularly sold arms
to the island's armed forces. Second, although there is no language in
the1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) that explicitly commits the United
States to come to Taiwan's defense in the event of an attack on the
island by China, many in Washington believe that such a commitment
exists. While there are different interpretations as to what the TRA
means, the most significant fact is that the vast majority of U.S.
political and military leaders are fully convinced that this legislation
binds the United States to a de facto alliance with Taiwan. China's
increased military assertiveness and greater level of armed provocations
in the Taiwan Strait and elsewhere around China's periphery in recent
years have only served to strengthen the conviction in Washington that
the island is a staunch democratic partner worthy of U.S. support as it
tries to defend tiny Taiwan against efforts by Beijing to coerce the
island into unwanted unification with China. However, Taiwan, unlike
Ukraine, is not a member of the United Nation. While Ukraine has
ambassador-level diplomatic relations with more than 180 countries,
including China and the United States, Taiwan only has full diplomatic
ties with approximately a dozen countries and none of these are major
powers. Yet, thanks to the TRA, Taipei enjoys robust quasi-diplomatic
relations with Washington, and thanks to Taiwan's pragmatic ingenuity,
the island possesses a vibrant worldwide network of de facto diplomatic
missions. Although Ukraine's diplomatic standing is far superior to
Taiwan's, the European country's military alliance status is less
impressive --- Ukraine is not a member of NATO, although it is a very
active member of NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative. While Taiwan
also has no formal military allies, the island has several close and
consequential security partners, most notably the United States. China
Is China and Taiwan Is Taiwan Taiwan continues to be the most
contentious issue in U.S.-China relations. Moreover, the Taiwan Strait
is routinely identified as the most plausible location of a military
confrontation between the United States and China. For Xi and his
Politburo colleagues, Taiwan looms large and is prominently identified
as a "core" national interest of China's, with Xi reiterating in 2021
that "resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China's complete
reunification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment of the
Communist Party of China" and that "no one should underestimate the
resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their
national sovereignty and territorial integrity." Moreover, most Chinese
citizens consider Taiwan to be Chinese territory and view the island as
something worth fighting for. Indeed, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
has staked its political legitimacy on the ultimate goal of unifying
Taiwan with China and in the meantime is working resolutely to prevent
the island from becoming de jureindependent. Beijing's preferred means
of realizing unification or preventing independence is peaceful but the
CCP has never renounced the use of armed force. Furthermore, the PLA's
central warfighting scenario is Taiwan and China's military has been
focused on planning and preparing for an operation against the island
for decades. A Cautionary Tale? The above differences notwithstanding,
Russia's combat experience in Ukraine will have a spillover impact on
how China thinks about Taiwan. If the Russian armed forces remain bogged
down in a stalemate in Ukraine for an extended period and/or face a
prolonged and widespread insurgency, this may give Xi and his fellow
Politburo members pause. If Russia's military experiences major setbacks
and perhaps even embarrassing defeats, this may make China's political
leaders think twice about the advisability of an invasion of Taiwan.
After all, an invasion of Ukraine is relatively straightforward --- the
country is geographically contiguous to Russia, sharing an extended land
border with mostly gentle terrain. By contrast, an invasion of the
island of Taiwan is a far more complex operation --- a successful
campaign requires careful planning and coordinated execution between
air, naval and ground forces. It would also involve amphibious landings
in addition to considerable urban warfare --- on an even larger scale
than in Ukraine --- including operations on rugged mountainous terrain.
Certainly, the PLA will carefully study Russia's Ukrainian campaign and
draw lessons from it, much as they have studied campaigns of other major
powers. Such analyses are conducted with great seriousness because
China's armed forces themselves have not fought a major war since 1979
(when Chinese forces invaded Vietnam) and have not conducted a major
island landing campaign since 1950 (against Hainan Island). **[One way
that [China's leadership might be taking notes from Russia's Ukraine
invasion is by rethinking the risks associated with
escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In addition to noting the potential
military embarrassment that Russia is facing[, **[China might be wary of
the sweeping economic sanctions levied by the international community.
If China were to receive similar backlash for an invasion of Taiwan, it
would raise the possibility of truly crippling sanctions at a time when
the Chinese economy is experiencing anemic growth and structural
challenges.]{.underline}**]{.mark} In particular, the weaponization of
the SWIFT payments system might give China pause. Russia has been trying
to popularize a cross-border financial information transmission system,
and China is committed to developing the CIPS payment network, but
neither has had significant success outside Russian or Chinese
borders**[. Despite its flaws, SWIFT remains the most efficient system
for international financial transactions for banks and [being removed
from SWIFT could potentially be devastating to the Chinese
economy.]{.mark} Furthermore, the lessons of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine to date are that the costs of armed aggression are high in blood
and treasure, as well as strong international censure of Moscow and a
resolute collective response by NATO member countries.]{.underline}**

war. Of broken promises [[The latest row is between Poland and
Germany]{.mark}, with the former accusing Berlin of reneging on an
agreement to supply Warsaw with new German tanks]{.underline} as
compensation for Polish deliveries of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine.

Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday accused Germany of breaking an
agreement to supply Warsaw with new tanks as compensation for Polish
deliveries of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, a claim rejected by Berlin.
In April, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz introduced \"Ringtausch,\" a
swap scheme under which eastern NATO partners would supply the Ukrainian
army with Soviet-era tanks like the T-72 in exchange for modern western
tanks from German manufacturers, such as the Leopard.

Scholz argued that the arrangement would benefit Ukraine because its
soldiers and mechanics are already familiar with Soviet-era tanks, while
eastern NATO countries receive an upgrade for giving up their tanks.
\"They (the Germans) have not fulfilled this promise. And frankly, we
are very disappointed about this,\" the Polish president told Die Welt
on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.

\"We have provided Ukraine with a large number of tanks ... because we
believe it is our responsibility as a neighbour,\" Duda told the
interviewer. Tanks for Ukraine According to reports, Warsaw passed on at
least 240 Soviet-era tanks to the Ukrainian military. \"By doing so, we
depleted our own military potential and stockpiles,\" he argued. The
German government rejected Duda\'s claims. \"[[The]{.underline}]{.mark}
federal [[government is **flabbergasted**]{.underline}]{.mark}, that\'s
how I would put it,\" government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said
Wednesday when asked for a reaction during a press conference in Berlin.

\"There was a clear request from the Polish side to transfer
state-of-the-art Leopard 2A7 main battle tanks to Poland, but the
problem is that the Bundeswehr itself only has a small number --- about
50 --- of these tanks,\" he said, adding that while \"more are in the
pipeline, they are not standing on a car yard or factory site anywhere;
they have to be manufactured.\" Claims and counterclaims

[[Scholz]{.underline}]{.mark} for his refusal to travel to Kyiv. \"I
think he should do that,\" Morawiecki told Die Welt. He added, \"There
is nothing better than visiting the capital of the fighting nation to
realise the seriousness of the situation, to get a sense of the
importance of all that is happening there.\" Scholz has refused to
travel to the Ukrainian capital for the moment, arguing that he had
already gone there 10 days before the Russian invasion started, and
would not go again \"for a quick in and out with a photoshoot\". \"If
\[I go to Kyiv\], then it\'s always about very specific things. And they
have to be prepared,\" Scholz told German television RTL last week.
German officials feel that Poland is trying to profit from its outward
generosity to Kyiv. In lieu of the old Soviet-era tanks they have passed
to Ukraine, the Poles are demanding that Germany recompense it with new,
modern German tanks. The leaders in Warsaw seem to target everyone else
in Europe, to flaunt that they have been at the forefront of the effort
to support Ukraine, while other countries remained laggards. Their
hostility to Putin has resulted in Russia cutting off gas supplies to
Poland after the latter refused to pay for the supplies in rubles as
demanded by Moscow. In frustration, Poland hit out at gas-rich Norway, a
member of the EU and NATO, accusing it of profiteering from the war. On
Sunday, Morawiecki claimed that Norway would earn an extra €100 billion
(\$106.9 billion) from energy sales this year due to a spike in oil and
gas prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine and international sanctions
on Russia, and demanded that the Nordic country share its bounty with
Kyiv, while obliquely suggesting that his country too deserved a share.
Morawiecki argued that Oslo shouldn\'t necessarily send its money to
Poland, but to Ukraine. He even suggested that Polish students lobby
with their Norwegian friends to pressure their country. Not profiteering
says Norway Norway hit back, making it clear that it would not give in
to Poland\'s demand. Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Eivind Vad
Petersson denied that his country was profiteering from the war. He
argued that the excess oil and gas revenues go into the country\'s
pension fund, also known as the Oil Fund, which was established in 1990
to make sure that this wealth serves the current and future generations
of Norwegians. Norway has arguably the best public welfare programme and
social safety net in the world, financed by its hydrocarbon revenues.
But the pension fund has lost 550 billion Norwegian krone (around \$56
billion) due to turbulence in the stock market, Petersson said. In
support of Moscow Elsewhere in Europe, countries like Hungary and Serbia
maintained their countries\' indirect support to Moscow. Hungarian prime
minister Viktor Orban has been a firm supporter of Putin and has refused
flatly to join the sanctions of the West against Russia. He has
categorically refused to abide by the EU sanctions on buying gas and oil
from Russia, arguing that his country just could not do without Russian
fuel supplies. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic echoed Orban\'s line,
declaring on Wednesday that despite pressure from the EU, Belgrade would
pursue its own independent policy. \"Right now, there is no such
possibility,\" Vucic informed Serbian state broadcaster RTS when asked
if Serbia could impose sanctions on Moscow. Serbia has steadfastly
refused to join NATO but has applied for membership in the EU. \"We look
out for our own interests,\" Vucic said. \"Who knows what kind of
threats we may face, but as you see, it\'s been 90 days and Serbia is
standing by its policy, the only country in all of Europe. A small
country with people small in numbers but very proud is following its own
policy -- not pro-Russian, not pro-Western, but its own,\" he pointed
out. \"You now talk about the territorial integrity of Ukraine, but you
didn\'t talk that way 23 years ago,\" Vucic said, referring to the 1999
NATO war that led to the Serbian province of Kosovo becoming independent
thanks to backing from the US and its allies. Threats from Turkey And
worsening yet another headache for the EU, Turkish government spokesman
Ibrahim Kalin said his government would not allow Finland and Sweden
into the NATO alliance until Turkey\'s \"concrete\" security concerns
regarding terrorism and sanctions are met. Kalin\'s remarks came at the
end of five-hour-long talks between delegations from Sweden and Finland
with their Turkish counterparts in Ankara to discuss their joint
applications to join NATO last week. Their admission to NATO needs the
unanimous consent of all 30 member states, and Turkey has threatened to
block the accession process unless the two countries crackdown on groups
it considers terrorists. Turkey has demanded that the two Nordic
countries lift arms export restrictions on Turkey, and extradite
activists of the Kurdistan Workers\' Party (PKK) and Gulen movement
(FETO) who have sought haven in the two countries. The differences
within the EU that have hobbled its efforts for a unified and aggressive
response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, may come to a head-on May
30 and 31, when the countries\' leaders meet in a summit in Brussels.
Countries express disquiet [[As the war]{.mark} in Ukraine [shows signs
of **prolonging**]{.mark}, voices expressing
[disquiet]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}over the way the West is

At the EU summit, Cyprus, Italy, and Hungary are likely to table a
resolution demanding a ceasefire in Ukraine and opening peace talks

exchanges seem to be becoming rough]{.underline}, with Ukraine brusquely
dismissing a suggestion by Henry Kissinger that Ukraine\'s borders be
set at the pre-invasion status quo. Ukraine demands that the Russian
forces withdraw to the pre-2014 level. Kissinger\'s suggestion is more
in line with the Russian recognition of the rebel provinces of Donetsk
and Lugansk as independent republics. Addressing the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Kissinger suggested that Ukraine give up the two
provinces to buy lasting peace with Russia. He said further alienation
of Russia might force it to become a strong and permanent ally of China,
endangering global security. Ukrainian presidential adviser Alexey
Arestovich flew off the handle at the suggestion that Ukraine barter
territory for peace with Russia.

#### Domestic backlash ensures fraying unity the longer the war goes on

[The West's unity over Ukraine could be starting to crack, just as
Russia's invasion gains ground]{.underline}

[Western unity over the war in Ukraine is becoming more vulnerable as
the conflict drags on.]{.underline}

[One poll across Europe found a majority of people want an end to the
war as soon as possible, even if it means territorial losses for
Ukraine.]{.underline}

There is an increasing level of concern among the public in Europe, and
beyond, about rising living costs.

There are increasing signs that [Western unity]{.underline} over the war
in Ukraine [could be starting to crack **as the conflict drags on and
leaders face public discontent** over rampant inflation and the
cost-of-living crisis.]{.underline}

There are widespread concerns over how long the war could continue, with
some strategists saying [it has all the hallmarks of a war of
attrition]{.underline} where no side "wins" and the losses and damage
inflicted by both sides, over a protracted and prolonged period, are
immense.

The U.S., U.K. and Eastern Europe appear staunch in their position that
Russia must not be able to succeed or "win" in Ukraine by carving out
(or reclaiming, as Moscow sees it) swathes of territory for itself,
saying that could have major global geopolitical repercussions.

They have also been clear that it is Ukraine that must decide if, and
when, it wants to negotiate with Russia over a peace deal. For its part,
Kyiv has said it is willing to conduct talks but that it has red lines,
chiefly, that it is not willing to concede any territory to Russia.

Nonetheless, there appears to be a faction within Europe --- namely
France, Italy and Germany --- that are hoping for a peace deal sooner
rather than later.

On Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron said Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his officials will have to negotiate with Russia
"at some point."

Macron and his German and Italian counterparts (who are all in Kyiv on
Thursday) have all called for a cease-fire and for a negotiated end to
the war, urging Russian President Vladimir Putin to hold peace talks
with Zelenskyy, to no avail.

In the meantime, Ukraine continues to plead for more weapons from its
Western allies, with NATO officials meeting this week in Brussels to
discuss Kyiv's urgent need for more arms.

It comes as Russia makes gains in eastern Ukraine largely as a result of
its relentless artillery bombardment of the Donbas. Russian forces are
making slow but steady progress in seizing more parts of the Luhansk and
Donetsk regions where two pro-Russian separatist "republics" are
located, which Moscow is intent on, as it says, "liberating" from
Ukraine.

The West continues to help Ukraine; U.S. President Joe Biden said
Wednesday that his administration will send \$1 billion more in weapons
to Kyiv, as well as another \$225 million in humanitarian aid. For Kyiv,
the weapons can't arrive quickly enough.

But [questions are now being asked over how long its military assistance
can last]{.underline}, particularly if the conflict continues for years.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby was asked on CNN how much Biden is
prepared to spend on Ukraine, given the inflation crisis and economic
pressures the U.S. is facing at home. Data released last Friday showed
the U.S. consumer price index rose 8.6% in May from a year ago, the
highest increase since December 1981, with similarly elevated levels in
Europe (the rate hit a 40-year high of 9% in the U.K. in April).

Saying Ukraine was "a key priority" for the president, Kirby said the
U.S. will "do as much as we can for as long as we can," reiterating that
the latest promise of weapons was just one small part of the larger \$40
billion in aid approved by Congress.

"This is the first tranche announced inside that \$40 billion total
package. So we still have quite a way to go here \... How long can all
that last? How long will the war last? Nobody can be sure," Kirby said.

"We know and predicted that the fight in the Donbas was going to be a
slog, that it was going to probably stretch this war out many months.
And it seems as if that's bearing fruit now."

Western leaders under pressure

When Russia's invasion started on Feb. 24, the West's unified opposition
to the war, and robust response in imposing a raft of tough sanctions
imposed on it, was striking.

[Four months into the conflict,]{.underline} however, and [Western
leaders are increasingly coming under pressure from their electorates as
the fallout from the conflict --- essentially, soaring food and energy
costs as a result of supply chain disruptions and sanctions on Russia
--- hit consumers hard.]{.underline}

Summing up the dilemma facing officials, Helima Croft, head of global
commodity strategy and MENA research at RBC Capital Markets, said,
"'What is the price you are willing to pay?' has seemingly emerged as
the central question of the summer, as Western leaders seek to balance
their desire to support the Ukrainian resistance with their urgent
imperative to tame inflation and stave off recessions."

There appears to be a geographic dimension to this divide, Croft noted
in her note Wednesday. "U.S., U.K. and eastern European leaders seem to
be the staunchest defenders of the principle that Ukrainians will
determine what constitutes a just peace and have expressed strong
commitments to defending Ukraine's territorial integrity."

However, she said, "officials from continental Europe and many
developing nations, on the other hand, appear more inclined to call for
a compromise that will provide Putin with a 'golden bridge' to retreat
across."

Croft said she had recently attended meetings and policy forums where
"there was an appreciable divide" between those officials calling for
more fulsome military assistance for Ukraine, and "those suggesting that
it is time for Ukraine to consider making concessions at the negotiating
table, citing the ruinous impact of rising commodity prices."

Europeans divided

A pan-European poll released Wednesday also indicated that Europeans'
sense of unity over the war in Ukraine could be starting to wane.

The study by the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank found
an increasing level of concern among the public over the costs of
economic sanctions and the threat of nuclear escalation, in particular.
It was based on polling of more than 8,000 people between April 28 and
May 11 across nine EU countries.

Some 35% of those questioned wanted to see an end to the conflict even
if it meant Ukraine conceding territory to Russia, whereas 22% said they
were more interested in seeing Russia punished for its aggression, even
if it meant prolonging the war.

In addition, a growing number of people said they were worried that
their governments were prioritizing the war ahead of other issues, such
as the cost-of-living crisis.

"Many in Europe want the war to end as soon as possible --- even if it
means territorial losses for Ukraine - and believe that the EU, rather
than the U.S. or China, will be 'worse off' as a result of this
conflict," the report on the poll's findings, co-authored by Mark
Leonard and Ivan Krastev, said.

"Unless something dramatically changes, Europeans will oppose a long and
protracted war. Only in Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Finland is there
substantial public support for boosting military spending."

#### NATO unity crumbling

**Murray, 22** -- The Telegraph

\[Douglas Murray, \"Nato's united front is crumbling now that Putin has
been humiliated in Ukraine,\" Telegraph, 5-23-2022,
https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2022/05/23/natos-united-front-crumbling-now-putin-has-humiliated-ukraine/,
accessed 6-19-2022\]

[Nato's united front is **crumbling now**]{.underline} that Putin has
been humiliated in Ukraine

[Western unity will be **sorely tested** if the conflict turns into a
war of attrition]{.underline} with no side claiming victory

Aquarter of a year has now passed since Vladimir Putin sent his tanks
into Ukraine. And the first drafts of history have already been written.
Their rough conclusions seem to go along the following lines.

First, to add to Talleyrand's famous phrase, Putin has committed both a
crime and a blunder. The Russian military has shown itself to be corrupt
and inefficient. The Ukrainians have shown themselves to be quite
astonishingly stalwart defenders of their homeland. And the West has
shown itself to be unpredictably united.

Of course, the problem with first drafts of history is that, while they
may be finished with history, history is not finished with them. The
conflict in Ukraine could still go in any number of directions. And
while a Russian victory now looks unlikely, it is not obvious that
Ukraine will emerge with its territory intact. Putin himself may yet act
as dictators can when cornered. And while much of the world moves on, it
is perfectly possible that the invasion of Ukraine becomes a conflict of
attrition which goes on for a long time to come.

Yet it is on the question of the West that I am particularly uncertain
about the first drafts currently circulating.

In some ways it is true that the Western alliances -- especially Nato --
have never looked stronger or more united. For 30 years, we had
discussions of "whither Nato". I took part in many of them myself. Well,
the answer is the one that was staring us in the face all along. Any and
all questions about the point of Nato fell apart the moment the Russian
tanks rolled into Ukraine. The applications for membership from Sweden
and other countries are a fine reminder of that fact. The swiftness with
which the Western banking system and political sanction systems snapped
into place was likewise a rather impressive moment of unity.

And yet, [**for all the talk** of the West acting in concert, when it
comes to responding to Putin's aggression, the picture is **far more
fractious** -- **and becoming more so**]{.underline}. As far as I can
see, there are three or four [factions]{.underline} within what we might
still call the Western alliance, and their various [positions appear to
be **diverging** as the war drags on.]{.underline}

First are those countries, including the UK, which foresaw Russia's
aggression and acted swiftly to support and arm our Ukrainian allies. It
is this part of the Western alliance which is presenting the world with
a vision of a united front. It is also this part that is most clear in
its view that Putin must be seen to fail because, as President Zelensky
put it yesterday, brute force must not be allowed to rule the world.

But other camps remain. They have not fallen into line behind the likes
of the UK, as some had expected. There are those who are indebted, not
to say compromised, by their recent arrangements with Russia. Despite
its promises of change, the most important country in Europe -- [Germany
-- is still severely compromised]{.underline}, from the top of its
politics down, [by decades-long cosying up to Putin. For energy
reasons]{.underline}, and much more, [there is still a strong strain of
thought in Berlin which disdains]{.underline} what the British are doing
in [Ukraine]{.underline}.

They would like to go back to the status quo ante, to be able to import
Russian energy cheaply and pass those gains on to German taxpayers, the
better to grandstand about green energy and much more. Their promises of
rearmament have so far come to little. The prolongation of the conflict
has not encouraged them to shift faster away from their prior approach,
but to drag their heels and hope that the old world can be restored.
Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, has hesitated while others have
acted.

Then there is the camp of the Elysée and the president there who
believes that, if he keeps a line open with Putin, he might in some way
solve the conflict. It is understandable that President Zelensky and
others have lost patience with President Macron. For the French leader
has done more than act as a middleman and he has done more than play
both sides. He has dared to give advice to the Ukrainians such as (in a
speech earlier this month) warning them not to give in to "temptation of
humiliation or of the spirit of revenge".

It is easy to sit in Paris and tell Ukrainians not to feel vengeful
towards Russia. The Russians tanks did not roll into the French capital.
Russian troops have not been committing war crimes in French towns and
cities. Nevertheless, Macron seems to be limbering up to play the
negotiating middleman -- the person willing to offer up a portion of
another nation's territory, in a deal which he would never accept were
the territory his own.

What makes all this much more difficult now is that there is a definite
sense -- most especially in Washington -- that an opportunity has arisen
to tie down Russia. This is the final camp. These are people who seem to
see Putin's slip-up as the perfect moment to not just encourage a
Russian defeat but to enable a Kremlin catastrophe, perhaps by miring
its forces in a conflict that they can never win.

A weakened Putin would undeniably have certain advantages. It would be
good if he is no threat for some decades to come. But this theory
forgets. firstly. that a prolonged conflict is easy to wish on people
from thousands of miles away, less agreeable for the citizens of the
Donbas and other regions. It also ignores the other consequences of this
war continuing, including the impact of Russia's blockade of Ukrainian
food exports.

And if the point of this strategy is to somehow push Putin from office,
that is simply not in the West's power, even if it was agreed to be a
desirable objective. Russian history suggests that palace coups do not
always end bloodlessly. The US has a plan for how to get the nukes out
of Pakistan if the Islamists ever take over that country. Does anyone
have a plan for how to secure Russia's nuclear sites if there is a
putsch and internecine war at the top of Russian politics? The people
urging regime change in Moscow ought to hope there is such a plan.

[So the Western alliance is not as cohesive as we might like to

### 1AR: Accession Thumper

#### Turkey is disrupting NATO unity

**Crowley, 22** \-- NY Times Washington Bureau diplomatic correspondent

\[Michael Crowley and Steven Erlanger, \"For NATO, Turkey Is a
Disruptive Ally,\" NY Times, 5-30-2022,

[For NATO, Turkey Is a Disruptive Ally]{.underline}

When President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey threatened this month to
block NATO membership for Finland and Sweden, Western officials were
exasperated --- but not shocked.

[Within an alliance that operates by consensus, the Turkish strongman
has come to be]{.underline} seen as something of [a **stickup
artist**.]{.underline} In 2009, [he blocked the appointment of a new
NATO chief from Denmark]{.underline}, complaining that the country was
too tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and too sympathetic to
"Kurdish terrorists" based in Turkey. It took hours of cajoling by
Western leaders, and a face-to-face promise from President Barack Obama
that NATO would appoint a Turk to a leadership position, to satisfy Mr.
Erdogan.

[After a rupture in relations between Turkey and Israel]{.underline} the
next year, Mr. [Erdogan prevented the alliance from working with the
Jewish state for six years]{.underline}. A few years later, Mr. [Erdogan
delayed for months a NATO plan to fortify Eastern European countries
against Russia]{.underline}, again citing Kurdish militants and
demanding that the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be
terrorists. In 2020, Mr. Erdogan sent a gas-exploration ship backed by
fighter jets close to Greek waters, causing France to send ships in
support of Greece, also a NATO member.

[Now the Turkish leader is back in the role of
**obstructionist**]{.underline}, and is once again invoking the Kurds,
[as he charges that Sweden and Finland sympathize with the Kurdish
militants he has made his main enemy.]{.underline}

"These countries have almost become guesthouses for terrorist
organizations," he said this month. "It is not possible for us to be in
favor."

Mr. [Erdogan's stance is a reminder of a **long-festering problem for
NATO**]{.underline}, which currently has 30 members. [Russia's invasion
of Ukraine may have given the alliance a new sense of mission, but NATO
must still contend with an **authoritarian leader** willing to use his
**leverage** to **gain political points at home** by **blocking
consensus**]{.underline} --- at least for a time.

[It]{.underline} i[s a situation that plays to the advantage
of]{.underline} President Vladimir V. [Putin]{.underline} of Russia,
[who has grown friendlier with]{.underline} Mr. [Erdogan]{.underline} in
recent years. [For the Russian leader, the rejection of Swedish and
Finnish admission into NATO would be a significant victory.]{.underline}

[The quandary would be simpler were it not for Turkey's importance to
the alliance.]{.underline} The country joined NATO in 1952 after
aligning with the West against the Soviet Union; [Turkey gives the
alliance a crucial strategic position]{.underline} at the intersection
of Europe and Asia, astride both the Middle East and the Black Sea. It
hosts a major U.S. air base where American nuclear weapons are stored,
and Mr. Erdogan has blocked Russian warships headed toward Ukraine.

[But]{.underline} under Mr. Erdogan, [Turkey has increasingly become a
problem to be managed]{.underline}. As prime minister and then as
president, he has tilted his country away from Europe while practicing
an authoritarian and populist brand of Islamist politics, especially
since a failed coup attempt in 2016.

He has purchased an advanced missile system from Russia that NATO
officials call a threat to their integrated defense systems, and in 2019
he mounted a military incursion to battle Kurds in northern Syria who
were aiding the fight against the Islamic State with U.S. support.

"[In my four years there, it was]{.underline} quite [often **27 against
one**,"]{.underline} [said]{.underline} Ivo H. [Daalder, a U.S.
ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration, when the alliance
had 28 members.]{.underline}

[Strongmen in Turkey and Hungary Stall Unity in NATO]{.underline} and
the E.U.

[Russia benefits as Turkey slows down Swedish and Finnish applications
to NATO and Hungary continues to block an E.U. embargo on Russian
oil.]{.underline}

[Europe's effort to stand up to Russia]{.underline} and Vladimir V.
Putin, its president, [is being slowed by two strongmen leaders
insisting on the priority of their national interests and playing to
domestic audiences.]{.underline}

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of [Turkey]{.underline} on Wednesday
[blocked a procedural vote on NATO moving ahead quickly with the
membership applications of Sweden and Finland]{.underline}, handed in
with much publicity Wednesday morning, a senior European diplomat said.

And Prime Minister Viktor [Orban of Hungary continues to block even a
watered-down European Union effort to put an embargo on Russian
oil,]{.underline} part of a sixth package of sanctions aimed at Moscow
for its war against Ukraine.

While NATO and the European Union have shown remarkable unity in their
response to Mr. Putin's [war, the actions of the two authoritarian
leaders show the strains building as the war drags on]{.underline},
peace talks appear to go nowhere, and Western sanctions are contributing
to economic pain and high inflation at home, as well as in Russia.

Mr. [Erdogan and]{.underline} Mr. [Orban may be outliers]{.underline} in
their organizations, [but they are able to use the requirement for
consensus in]{.underline} both [NATO]{.underline} and the European Union
to get their political concerns addressed [by blocking the action of all
the others]{.underline}, even temporarily.

### 1AR: China Answers

**China does not have the capabilities launch a full-scale war against
Taiwan -- not enough ships, geography prevents, and Taiwan's
infrastructure not sufficient for full-scale attack.**

**Ullman, 2/18** - Senior Advisor at the Atlantic Council

\[Dr. Harlan Ullman, Senior Advisor at the Atlantic Council, February
18, 2022, "Reality Check #10: China will not invade Taiwan,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/reality-check/reality-check-10-china-will-not-invade-taiwan/>,
accessed 4-2-2022\]

Despite Beijing's longstanding desire to invade and conquer Taiwan and
achieve "one China[," **[China simply lacks the military capability and
capacity to launch a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan for the
foreseeable future.]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[With a potential defending
force of 450,000 Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one
ratio of attackers to defenders taught at war colleges, to undertake an
invasion, [China would need over 1.2 million soldiers]{.mark} (out of a
total active force of over 2 million[) that would have to be transported
in many thousands of ships.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Although Beijing is
unlikely to launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan, given China's
strength, autocratic government, and ambitions, the United States cannot
totally ignore the risk of such an attack. At the same time, however,
Washington should develop an overall strategy designed to deter the most
likely scenarios---such as imposing economic and financial embargoes on
Taiwan, imposing a maritime blockade of the island, or attempting a
regime change from within---or prevail militarily if deterrence fails.
China does have many other options for pressuring Taiwan. What's the
issue? The Trump administration's National Defense Strategy (NDS) was
substantially predicated on preventing two faits accomplis: a Russian
invasion of the Baltics and a Chinese amphibious assault on Taiwan. To
what degree these scenarios will survive the Biden administration's
soon-to- be-released strategic review remains to be seen. The most
likely outcome is that "integrated deterrence," Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin's term---for now more a slogan than a strategic concept
that attempts a more "wholistic" all-of-government effort---will become
prominent, as will a greater focus on the "deter" element rather than on
"defeat" as was the last NDS. Defining what defeat means and how it
would be achieved remains elusive. Some observers believe that how the
United States handles the Ukraine crisis will be closely watched by
China. That is true. But, as this paper argues, the Ukraine crisis will
not influence Chinese decisions on whether or not to launch a full-scale
amphibious invasion because, given the force demands, China simply lacks
the capacity to do so for the foreseeable future. The current and former
heads of Indo-Pacific Command have warned about China's building the
necessary forces to invade and conquer Taiwan, possibly by decade's end.
Given China's long-standing determination to make Taiwan part of the
mainland and achieve "one China," a military takeover of Taiwan sounds
plausible. **[However, [this notion is based on a fundamental
misperception regarding China's capability to launch a major amphibious
assault]{.mark}.]{.underline}** If China were to launch such a military
attack on Taiwan, what would that take in terms of forces and force
levels? Does China possess the requisite numbers and capabilities? If
not, when, if at all, might it build those forces that, if history
counts, would number in the hundreds of thousands of troops and
thousands of ships and maritime assault vehicles? Current and past
studies do not successfully or specifically address these questions.
These studies focus on the how, but not on the specific manpower
requirements of what would be required to carry out an invasion. The
definitive document on what size force would be required to seize Taiwan
in a full-out landing was drafted by the US military in the late stages
of World War II in the Pacific. In 1944, Operation Causeway was the US
plan for retaking Formosa, as it was then called, from 30,000 starving
Japanese soldiers. The planned invasion force was double the size of
Operation Overlord, the Normandy landing: 400,000 soldiers and marines
deployed on 4,000 ships. With a potential defending force of 450,000
Taiwanese today, using the traditional three-to-one ratio of attackers
to defenders taught at war colleges, China would need to deploy over 1.2
million soldiers (out of a total active force of over 2 million). Many
thousands of ships would be required to land all those forces, and doing
so would take weeks. How many occupation forces would be required to
pacify the Taiwanese? Surely the lessons of Afghanistan and Iraq are not
lost on the PLA leadership. **[[China possesses a small fraction of the
necessary ships to execute a landing of that size and lacks the capacity
to do so for the foreseeable future. Nor are there any current plans
suggesting China is intent on procuring such a force, though that could
change.]{.mark} Further[, Taiwan is not conducive to any form of
amphibious assault. A handful of landing sites on the west coast are
blocked by proximate mountainous areas]{.mark} running the length of the
250-mile-long island, some approaching 10,000 feet in
height.]{.underline}** Defenders could fall back using this difficult
terrain to wage a guerrilla war. Moreover[, **[Taiwan lacks the
infrastructure to support over a million invaders and their logistical
needs, most of which would have to come from the
mainland.]{.underline}** F]{.mark}ixating on an unlikely scenario, no
matter how compelling it sounds, skews US resources and force levels.

### AT Authoritarianism

**No impact to authoritarianism -- it's media hype**

**Leong '19** \[Ho Wai Clarence Leong holds an MSc from the Columbia
University Graduate School of Journalism and an MA in English and Modern
History from the University of St. Andrews, is the Asia newswire editor
for Dow Jones, "In an age of authoritarianism, the world sees glimmers
of hope," 3-19-19,
<https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Progress-Watch/2019/0319/In-an-age-of-authoritarianism-the-world-sees-glimmers-of-hope>\]

In the past year, citizens of Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and
Ethiopia have taken to the streets to demand accountability from their
governments, while voters in Malaysia and the Maldives ousted corrupt
governments at the ballot box. [[Countries]{.mark} with a strong civil
society or decent-sized middle class [continue to push back against
autocrats, even though]{.mark} the [headlines are more]{.mark} often
[about]{.mark} the [threats to democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. That's
not to say democracy has nothing to worry about. A new paper published
this month found that the world has been in "a wave of autocratization"
since 1994, and as many as 75 democracies have seen a reversal to
autocracy. Modern-day autocrats know better than to blatantly shore up
power, but do so gradually and under a legal facade, making it harder to
detect, researchers say. Autocrats pit authoritarianism against
democracy, promoting it as a more efficient form of governance and
spreading the technology that strengthens control. Social media
amplifies the spread of misinformation, clouding voters' judgment.
Global freedom, which is composed of political rights and civil
liberties, has been in decline for the 13th year in a row, according to
[a new report from [Freedom House]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the same
report also [[notes significant improvement in accountability for
corruption in Angola, Armenia, and other nations. Political
participation in most]{.mark} parts [of the world has seen a continuous
upward trend]{.mark}]{.underline}, reports The Economist. And [while
**[autocrats]{.mark}** threaten democracies, they **[are]{.mark}** also
"**[fueling a powerful counterattack]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Human
Rights Watch notes in its latest annual report.
"[[Those]{.underline}]{.mark} who are [[bemoaning]{.mark} this
[authoritarian turn]{.mark} in the world [were overstating]{.mark} the
case]{.underline}," says Steven Levitsky, a political scientist at
Harvard and co-author of "How Democracies Die." [The euphoric expansion
of democracy in the 1990s led to the over-optimistic belief that
authoritarianism was a thing of the past, and now that expectation has
been dashed]{.underline}, he says. [But "there's yet to emerge a real,
viable, truly legitimate alternative to democracy in the
world."]{.underline} That doesn't discount the fact that people are
disillusioned with traditional political parties and losing confidence
in democracy. But [rather than disengaging]{.underline} from it, that
[dissatisfaction is driving citizens to participate in political
processes]{.underline}, according to The Economist. [Voter turnout and
membership of political parties rose, reversing a downward trend. A
larger proportion of the world's population is now willing to engage in
lawful demonstrations]{.underline}. The Economist also notes a
particularly striking area of progress coming from female participation
in politics. "Women have become much more active, not just in \[the\]
U.S. but around the world," says Steven Leslie, lead analyst at The
Economist Intelligence Unit. "[[There is an ongoing surge of female
participation]{.mark} in politics and [in activities]{.mark} that are
[essential to democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}." [Barriers like
discriminatory laws and socioeconomic obstacles are gradually being
removed. In Rwanda and Ethiopia, half of the cabinet ministers are
women. New legislation in Japan encourages gender parity in
parliament]{.underline}. In the United States, the voters in the
November midterms elected the highest number of women to Congress in
history -- though they still make up only 23.7 percent. Still, the
international atmosphere has become less favorable to the expansion of
democracy. Not only is the totalitarian state of China spreading its
influence, but cracks are appearing in decades-old alliances such as the
European Union and NATO. In the EU, both Italy and Turkey saw their
rankings in The Economist's democracy index fall by at least 10 places.
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, the U.S. is becoming more
isolationist, analysts say. "America's commitment to the global progress
of democracy in its foreign policy has been seriously compromised," says
Sarah Repucci, senior director for research and analysis at Freedom
House. In one example, when the U.S. withdrew from the council on human
rights at the United Nations, it left "a huge vacuum of power," says
Rosa Freedman, a professor of law, conflict, and global development at
the University of Reading in England and author of several books on the
U.N. [Despite the downward trends]{.underline}, however, **[[countries
are forming new alliances to put pressure on repressive
regimes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, reports [[H]{.mark}uman [R]{.mark}ights
[W]{.mark}atch]{.underline}. It [[points to]{.mark} the example of [the
EU and]{.mark} a group of [Muslim-majority countries working]{.mark}
together to create a mechanism [at the U.N. to collect evidence on the
ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas]{.mark}, which could be used in future
trials of the Myanmar government]{.underline}. A group of [[Latin
American countries led a resolution in the H]{.mark}uman [R]{.mark}ights
[C]{.mark}ouncil [to condemn]{.mark} the severe [persecution of
Venezuelans]{.mark}]{.underline} under President Nicolás Maduro. Other
[[human rights mechanisms have sprung up in unexpected
places]{.underline}]{.mark}, adds Joseph Saunders, deputy program
director at Human Rights Watch. [For example, the organizing bodies of
big sports tournaments, such as the World Cup and the Olympics, will
scrutinize the bidders and hosts' human rights records]{.underline}.
"These are obviously dark times," says Mr. Saunders. "But [\[you\] miss
a large part of the picture if you don't see the pushback that is also
happening]{.underline}."

**No impact to authoritarians -- they're unsustainable and can't
mobilize**

**Ganesh '20** \[Janan Ganesh was a Researcher at the Policy Exchange
and is the principal political columnist with the Financial Times,
"Bonhomie but no brotherhood: The authoritarian bloc that never was,"

Bill Hicks, the late comic and grouch, dreamt of a political party for
"people who hate people". He just couldn't get them to come together in
the same room. The great egoist movement was undone by its central
principle. I think of the skit whenever [[the world]{.underline}]{.mark}
brotherhood [[of]{.mark} jingoist [authoritarians is talked
up]{.mark}]{.underline}. US president Donald Trump is in this group,
with, among others, the leaders of China (Xi Jinping), Russia (Vladimir
Putin), India (Narendra Modi) and Brazil (Jair Bolsonaro). Trump and Xi
are superpower rivals, America cancelled India's preferential trading
status, and still the idea of a Nationalist International survives. [[It
should not survive the]{.mark} coronavirus [pandemic]{.mark}. Recent
months have further teased out the differences between these conflated
governments. Their domestic autocracy is real enough, but [their
coherence as a bloc is overstated. **Liberalism is not confronted by
anything like a unified opponent**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most vivid
case in point is the US-China blame-game. It is also the least
surprising. Relations were dire before the virus, and it should not be
news that nativists feud more easily than they collude across national
lines. World war allusions have flowed too cheaply of late, but it is
hard not to think of the [[autocrats]{.underline}]{.mark} who mercifully
[[failed to act in concert for long in the previous century.
Leaders]{.mark} who believe in the separateness of nations above all
else will [always have trouble co-ordinating]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
long as this is true, [the position of **[liberal democracy is less
exposed than it sometimes looks]{.mark}**. What its enemies have in
numbers and geographic spread they lack in togetherness]{.underline}. At
present, they cannot agree on the efficacy of the World Health
Organisation. The prospect of a new world order built around their
shared preferences seems far off. As telling as the diplomatic schisms
between nationalists is their range of antivirus policies. Mainstream
governments have converged on much the same strategy, couched in much
the same language. It is true enough that some were quicker than others
and some were better prepared to begin with. As lives are at issue, the
stragglers should be held to eventual account. Free-for-all But as time
passes, what distinguishes the approaches of, say, France, Canada and
Ireland, lies in the details. Given how many countries fall into the
non-populist category, true outliers such as Sweden, with its minimal
lockdown, are amazingly few. Compare this with the free-for-all inside
the populist world. Modi has kept the second-largest population on Earth
at home for a month. Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, took
measures against the virus relatively early. At the opposite end, there
is the laxity of Trump and Bolsonaro. [**[The crisis has exposed how
little connects these leaders]{.mark}** beyond a surface bonhomie. Some
pretend to be serious about the business of government, some do not. A
club that encompasses them all is likely to be meaningless]{.underline}.
Notice, too, how gaping are its exit doors. By embracing a shutdown,
however tardily, and not talking up a relaxation, Boris Johnson is
viewed ever more as a "normal" leader. At least before his illness, the
UK premier was counted unambiguously among the nativists. Scott
Morrison, the Australian prime minister, after tackling the virus
seriously, has undergone a similar reassignment. The nationalist team
roster has thinned in a few weeks, which tells you how much rigour the
idea ever had. And this is not just about personalities. There are
theoretical contradictions within populism. This is a creed that cannot
decide what it thinks about personal freedom. It resents technocratic
bossiness while brooking no checks and balances in the protection of the
homeland. Trump claims "total authority", yes, but to loosen
restrictions on people, not to tighten them (except for would-be
immigrants). If this tension is evident in one leader, imagine its
permutations for policy across several governments across several
continents across several issues. Even according an "-ism" to such a
disparate bunch is to flatter them. It is understandable that we do. We
are a pattern-recognising species, and sometimes a pattern-inventing
one. It is consoling to detect some kind of shape to the world. But the
point is to not make the pattern itself more frightening than anarchic
reality. No doubt, the [[momentum has been with authoritarians in recent
times. The question is whether they add up to a cohesive front]{.mark}
against democracy]{.underline}. An empire of
[[illiberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, on which the sun never sets,
[[assumes more unity than could feasibly exist]{.mark} among national
egoists]{.underline}. It just took a crisis to show it.
