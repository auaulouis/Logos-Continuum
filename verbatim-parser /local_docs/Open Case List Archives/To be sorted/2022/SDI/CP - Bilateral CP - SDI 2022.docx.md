As a result of the war in Ukraine, policymakers in Europe and North
America have scrambled to strengthen defense cooperation in Europe. The
headlines inevitably [[focus on **NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
European Union. Yet this [[**ignores** the **reality** of how]{.mark}
European [defense coop]{.mark}eration [is actually]{.mark} established,
[fostered]{.mark}, and solidified]{.underline}. Indeed, [the essence of
defense cooperation in Europe is a web of hundreds of bilateral and
minilateral collaborations. Often, **NATO**]{.underline} and the
European Union [work [merely]{.mark} as [a framework into which]{.mark}
European [countries **upload** their **existing bi**]{.mark}**- and
mini[lateral efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[To better enhance European defense, policymakers should appreciate the
dynamics of these]{.underline} many [collaborations]{.underline}. Taking
advantage of the current circumstances [[to build **more**]{.mark}
**mini and [bilat]{.mark}eral [ties]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly
where leadership and financial circumstances are most conducive, [[will
**strengthen**]{.mark} Europe [and make]{.mark} its
**[multilat]{.mark}eral [institutions]{.mark}** that much **[more
formidable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A History of Bilateralism and Minilateralism

In a few months, NATO countries have deployed thousands of troops and
significant capabilities to enhance the defense of members on its
eastern flank. In a stunning transition, two traditionally militarily
non-aligned E.U. states, Sweden and Finland, re-evaluated their
geostrategic position and submitted applications to join NATO. The
debate about boosting the European Union's "strategic autonomy" has
become even more intense, and once again, member states are discussing
coordinating their defense spending via joint procurements.

These vital [[initiatives **could not work without**]{.mark} existing,
critical [**lower-level** collaborations]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, Russian military actions over the last several years in Ukraine
prompted NATO's eastern-flank allies to work swiftly together with their
bi- and minilateral partners. The United Kingdom took on a leading role
in Estonia, building on the close relations the two countries developed
carrying out dangerous operations over a decade in Afghanistan's Helmand
province. Lithuania is a relevant defense market for Germany, and not
surprisingly, the Bundeswehr leads NATO efforts there. Thanks to
cultural similarity and extensive previous military cooperation, the
Czech Republic has sent the most troops to Slovakia and oversees the
international forces located there. For similar reasons, France deployed
500 troops to Romania. Such comparatively low-key actions were crucial
in developing the necessary bottom-up relations, norms, and experiences
upon which more recent grandiose announcements build.

Although Finland and Sweden intend to join NATO, they also found it
essential to sign bilateral mutual security deals with the United
Kingdom. This could happen quickly, mainly because Helsinki and
Stockholm have built trust with London working together in the
British-led Joint Expeditionary Force. The dynamics in the European
Union are the same as in NATO. For example, in 2017, the European Union
established the Permanent Structured Cooperation to strengthen defense
cooperation among its member states after the Russian occupation in
Crimea. However, most of its projects were based on existing bi- and
minilateral defense initiatives, and the participating states often just
rebranded them according to the new E.U. vocabulary.

The fact that existing bi- and minilateral relationships are the
foundation of defense cooperation in Europe is not a new phenomenon. [A
**survey of [70 examples]{.mark}** of European defense collaboration
highlighted that **[most]{.mark}**]{.underline} have five or fewer
participating states, and many [are **[purely
bilat]{.mark}eral**]{.underline}. These collaborations [range from
creating multinational units to cooperating on **armaments**,
**training**, **logistics**, **surveillance**, operations, and/or
**c**ommand **and c**ontrol]{.underline}. [More often than not, these
collaborations are **[not part of NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} or the
European Union, [**[but]{.mark}** they [**can be rebranded**
as]{.mark}]{.underline} E.U. and [**[NATO]{.mark}** projects
[**quickly** if]{.mark} it is [necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[States]{.underline}]{.mark} can also [[use these]{.mark}
collaborations [to **shape NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and E.U.
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For instance, the NATO operation in
Libya in 2011 was basically an Anglo-French war, as France and Britain
pushed for the intervention and took the brunt of the fight. They used
NATO's command structure to coordinate their war effort and the limited
military support they gained from some NATO members helped fill their
capability gaps. The background of this was a historical and overarching
British-French bilateral defense agreement, the Lancaster House
Treaties, which the leaders of the two European military powers signed a
year earlier. The launch of the European Union's European Security and
Defence Policy in 1999 also stemmed from a British-French bilateral
agreement in St. Malo in 1998 as well.

Strengthening the Network

**[[Improving NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and E.U. [**defense
[coop]{.mark}eration [requires]{.mark} looking under the hood** to
appreciate the role of [these efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scholars
have already pointed out that Europeans must recognize the minilateral
foundations of Europe's security architecture. This corresponds with my
experience as a former defense official. [European
**[m]{.mark}**inistries **[o]{.mark}**f **[d]{.mark}**efense [do
**not**]{.mark} always [think in terms of]{.mark} institutions
like]{.underline} the European Union and
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [They have their own considerations,
and they are using the framework that fits their goals the best, which
can be NATO]{.underline}, the European Union, [or smaller
formats]{.underline}. [[**Starting** an initiative **at this level**
is]{.mark} often [**more effective** and]{.mark} can [provide results
**more quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As I argue in my newly published book, while these forms of cooperation
are not new, their recent proliferation is unprecedented in Europe's
history. Furthermore, [they [**provide the substance** of]{.mark}
practical military [coop]{.mark}eration in Europe, [which
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the European Union [can **[build
on]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, [comprehending the dynamics behind them
is **crucial to foster effective defense cooperation** moving
forward]{.underline}. The research in my book indicates that when
European nations start new defense collaborations, five structural and
situational factors are important to achieve success.

In an effort to get beyond "mutual trust" and "consultations", [we asked
our [**experts** in]{.mark} each EU member state]{.underline} to tell us
what they saw as the three most important issues in that state's
relationship with the US. The responses are tabulated at Annex 1. [The
**lack** of a **common** set of **European priorities** for [the
**transatlantic relationship**]{.mark} is **well illustrated**; the
issues cited range across most regions of the world and also include
global issues as diverse as climate change, democratisation, and nuclear
non-proliferation]{.underline}. There is also a high incidence of
"parochial" issues, especially for the smaller states (for example,
Malta's problem with illegal immigration), [suggesting a tendency to
look across the Atlantic for help on issues on which the EU seems to be
of no help [because it **lacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} either a remit or
a **[[consensus]{.underline}]{.mark}** or both. Even when respondents
cited the importance of "investment and trade", they were actually
referring to individual national interest; the collective EU interests
that the Commission defends are seemingly so effectively delegated to
the EU level that they slip out of national consciousness.

The big exception to this confusion of views and priorities is security
and defence -- listed among the top three issues by three-quarters of
our respondents, and by many as the most important aspect of the
transatlantic relationship. This preoccupation is by no means confined
to those recently escaped from the Soviet empire; most western Europeans
feel the same. [Nearly **[all]{.mark}** of our respondents [judged
**bilat**]{.mark}**eral** counter-terrorism **[co-op]{.mark}eration
[with the US]{.mark}** [to be]{.mark} close, **[productive]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} largely **[immune to turbulence]{.mark}
elsewhere**]{.underline}.16 [**All** regarded the continued engagement
of the US in Europe's defence as vital -- [with **NATO**]{.mark}, "the
bedrock of our security"]{.underline} (see national defence white papers
passim), [as the **key institution**]{.underline}.

In general, therefore, European attitudes have evolved remarkably little
over the 20 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall. [Our **audit**
suggests that]{.underline}, despite the expansion and evolution of the
EU and, in particular, the development of its external identity --
despite, indeed, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the global
diffusion of power -- [member states continue to think of the
transatlantic relationship in terms of **NATO** and of **bilateral**
relations]{.underline}. [The Cold War dispensation, whereby the US
offered Europeans security and the role of junior associates in running
the world in exchange [for]{.mark} **European [solidarity]{.mark}**,
remains deeply ingrained. Europeans seem essentially to want more of the
same]{.underline} -- especially now that there is a US president who
Europeans can believe shares their own instincts.

**[How do they aim to get it?]{.underline}**

[This picture of a Europe **preoccupied** with the defence and
**security dimension** of **transatlantic relations**,
**[reluctant]{.mark}** in consequence [to do **anything that might rock
the boat**]{.mark}, and determined to [pursue]{.mark} its [interests
**bilaterally rather than collectively**]{.mark} is reinforced by our
enquiries into the various assets and levers that different European
states felt they were able to use in attempting to get what they wanted
from Washington]{.underline}. The results are set out at Annex 2.

Once again, it is striking that the vast majority of assets or levers
identified by our respondents relate to their role in diplomatic and
especially defence and security co-operation with the US. Many member
states believe that they have particular regional expertise or
connections that Washington values; others list their readiness to
promote democracy, especially in the eastern neighbourhood and the
Caucasus. A majority point to their support for US military operations
or the hosting of US military bases (10 member states support a
continuing US military presence in Europe of some 70,000). One-third of
EU member states even regard their geographical location as a key asset
vis-à-vis the US. Beyond that, the other widely perceived asset is what
we have termed "cultural links" -- affinities of history or ethnicity
which Europeans believe to have enduring political value. In short,
Europeans aim to present themselves to the US as useful and attractive
-- and more so than their peers.

So one answer to the question of how Europeans seek to advance their
transatlantic interests is: for defence, through NATO; for trade and
competition issues, through the EU; and for almost everything else,
bilaterally.

[This **[preference for the bilat]{.mark}eral [track]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} more [easily understood]{.mark} when it becomes clear how
many of the European [member states **believe**]{.mark} **themselves to
have some particular comparative advantage** in dealing with
Washington]{.underline} (see table below). [The UK is not alone, or even
in a minority, in cherishing the idea that its "special relationship'"
[is **more advantageous than any collective**]{.mark} **European
[approach]{.mark}**]{.underline}.17

Today's **[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]{.underline}** is no Cold
War alliance. Few developments illustrate NATO's capacity for adaptation
more than its 21st century role in Afghanistan.1 NATO allies invoked the
collective defense provision---Article 5---of its founding treaty for
the first and only time just one day after the September 11, 2001,
terrorist attacks.2 Few present at the signing of the North Atlantic
Treaty in 1949 could have imagined it would be invoked by European
countries and Canada seeking to support the United States or that the
Alliance's largest and longest military operation would occur in central
Asia. Fewer still might have predicted NATO allies would agree to the
mission so soon after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, a crisis the
then US ambassador to NATO described as a "near death experience" for
the Alliance.3 Yet NATO assumed control of the International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) in 2003 and has remained in Afghanistan for the
better part of two decades.

As the United States has begun negotiating a political settlement to the
Afghanistan conflict with a view to the eventual withdrawal of
international forces there, an assessment from the overall NATO
perspective will complement the national initiatives.4 This effort will
also support ongoing efforts to reassess NATO's priorities in the face
of other security challenges.5

Although NATO has undertaken formal studies of its activities in
Afghanistan, recent scholarship by Heidi Hardt, Jörg Noll, and
Sebastiaan Rietjens cast doubt on the efficacy of formal lessons learned
processes in international organizations generally and in NATO
specifically.6 This article offers an external and an unofficial
assessment of the Alliance's efforts and provides initial suppositions.
In sum, NATO's impact in Afghanistan may not have been enough to
mitigate national shortcomings or to achieve victory on its own, but it
was significant and positive. The Alliance's adaptability and highly
institutionalized character are at the root of these contributions.

Moreover, the mission in Afghanistan affected NATO in ways that promoted
allied political cohesion, organizational effectiveness, and military
interoperability. The chief implications of these findings are that
while national political leadership and strategy formulation remain
paramount in war, NATO remains a proven and effective instrument of
organizing and implementing coordinated multinational efforts. The most
important lesson learned from NATO in Afghanistan may therefore be about
NATO's more general value to the United States and other members.

NATO: Alliance and International Organization

[In contrast to national assessments, this analysis focuses on the
formal institutions of the Alliance. [**NATO** is **unique**]{.mark}
**among alliances** in that it is [**not only** a
**treaty**]{.mark}**-based agreement [among member states]{.mark}**,
[**but also** an **international organization**]{.mark}---and a
**[highly institutionalized]{.mark}** one at that]{.underline}. Since
its early years, [NATO has been **comprised of** a permanently staffed
**formal political headquarters** supported by a **network of military
and civilian organizations**]{.underline}. Particularly noteworthy is
NATO's integrated joint multinational military structure, a unique
innovation without equivalent among other alliances or international
organizations.

This integration, capped by the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers
Europe (SHAPE) in Belgium, extends through various echelons and included
the ISAF headquarters and other NATO structures in Afghanistan.7
[Thus]{.underline}, for this article, **[["NATO" refers to the]{.mark}
various [formal institutions]{.mark} and [not the]{.mark} group of
[allied countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Likewise, the [**focus** is
on]{.mark} the **[collaborative conduct]{.mark}**]{.underline} and not
that of the United States, other allies or partners, the government of
Afghanistan, or other regional actors. Nor does the article address the
efficacy of counterinsurgency warfare.

International relations theory would emphasize the formal institutions
of NATO have very weak independent power and agency.

But although NATO consists of such formal institutions, the Alliance
remains an alliance among states. [**[All decisions at NATO]{.mark}**
Headquarters [are]{.mark} taken [by **consensus**]{.mark} among member
states]{.underline} (which will soon number 30). Politics among those
countries happens, and the relative influence of individual member
states is closely associated with their power. [**[NATO's institutions
matter]{.mark}** chiefly [because]{.mark} of how [they]{.mark}
facilitate and [**structure the relations** among the
states]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Like any other international organization,
states may derive value from such institutions because they provide
benefits such as establishing predictable structures and routines for
decision-making; increasing information sharing; improving efficiency
and reducing transaction costs; and defining roles, status, and
identity]{.underline}. [The **most important questions**]{.underline}
for NATO [in the context of assessing its role]{.underline} in the

The first section will examine the value of NATO as a security partner
for Japan from the following four perspectives: 1) a political partner;
2) an operational partner; 3) as a means of cooperation with the US; and
4) a multilateral school. The second section will use a similar method
to examine the significance of security cooperation with the EU, viewing
it from the following three perspectives: 1) a political partner; 2) an
operational partner; and 3) as a "non-American" partner.

There are two things to be mentioned before going into substantial
discussions below. First, from the perspective of "mutually using the
other," it would be necessary to examine the value of Japan as a partner
for Europe. However, it goes beyond the scope of this article, which is
focused on the Japanese side of the story. That said, it needs to be
mentioned that it is necessary for Japan to be prepared and willing to
be used by Europe as long as Japan wants to use Europe and that letting
Europeans understand the value of Japan as a partner is in Japan's
interest.

Second, [this article focuses on [**cooperation** **with

the majority of]{.underline} dialogue and [cooperation]{.underline}
between Japan and Europe [in the areas of foreign policy, security, and
defense have been conducted under bilateral frameworks]{.underline} with
major European countries. [As a result]{.underline}, the accumulation of
knowledge and experience in Japan with regard to [**cooperation** **with
NATO**]{.underline} and the EU [remain shallow **compared** to
**bilateral** relations **with individual countries**]{.underline}.
Against this backdrop, this article will focus on NATO and the EU.

1\. NATO's transformation and the development of Japan--NATO
cooperation: How to use NATO9

\(1\) NATO as a political partner

From a Japanese perspective, NATO can be seen, first, as a political
partner, meaning a partner with which to have political dialogue. When
visiting NTO and addressing the North Atlantic Council (NAC), both
Foreign Minister Taro Aso (May 2006) and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
(January 2007) spent a great deal of time talking about the security
environment in Asia, including the abduction and other issues of North
Korea as well as China's military buildup.10 Abe directly requested the
understanding and support of NATO members concerning Japan's stance on
the North Korean abduction and other issues. This illustrates the fact
that, for Japan, dialogue with NATO is a new venue to acquire
understanding and support from Europe for its position on problems
related to politics and security in Asia.

With regard to political and security dialogue between Japan and Europe,
in addition to traditional bilateral frameworks between Japan and major
European countries like the UK, France and Germany, there is now a
channel between Japan and the EU (to be discussed later). Dialogue with
NATO provides a new venue for discussion. In addition to Prime Minister
and ministeriallevel visits to NATO (meetings with the NATO Secretary
General and the NAC) and dialogue with the NATO Secretary General during
his visits to Japan, at the officials' level there is the annual Japan
--NATO High-Level Consultation. Moreover, in addition to dialogue with
NATO officials ---the International Staff and the International Military
Staff--- ad hoc meetings are held from time to time between Japanese
officials and representatives of the member states' delegations to NATO
in the context of the Political Committees (PC), Policy Cooperation
Groups (PCG), and other frameworks depending on the topics to be
discussed, such as the security situation in East Asia, Central Asia,
and missile defense. In recent years, the NAC and the Secretary General
have issued statements condemning North Korea's nuclear and missile
tests, which Japan appreciates a lot, showing one aspect of NATO's value
as a political partner.11 NATO is a forum suitable for Japan to discuss
Asian security and other security-related issues mainly because many
security experts, both civilian and military, are assembled and deal
with various security problems on a daily basis.

Japan is not alone in seeing NATO as a political partner. NATO is often
described as the strongest and the most successful military alliance in
history and encompassing all major powers from North America and Europe.
Thus, NATO inevitably carries a unique weight in international security
and world politics. That weight may even be heavier than NATO itself is
aware.12 In fact, demand from non-members to conduct political dialogue
with NATO has been increasing. At the same time, countries that do not
necessarily have positive perceptions of NATO or that do not share
fundamental values with the Alliance often see the strengthening of
relations between NATO and non-members with concern and suspicion. For
instance, Russia and China often react with vigilance when Japan and
NATO cooperate. This partly comes from their genuine concerns over the
strengthening of concrete military cooperation between Japan and NATO,
but it also has to do with their recognition of NATO's political weight.
Moreover, these countries view Japan--EU and Japan --NATO cooperation
differently. Put simply, they react more negatively to the latter than
the former. This fact demonstrates that NATO carries a distinctive
profile as a political actor that differs from that of the EU.

Nevertheless, it goes without saying that NATO is a military alliance
based on collective defense. NATO is not supposed to be aiming to expand
its political and diplomatic influence as a political actor in
international relations. This is how NATO differs from the EU, which has
been trying to construct a common foreign, security, and defense policy.
At the same time, however, NATO is not an alliance that concerns
military affairs alone. NATO has long labeled itself a politicalmilitary
alliance, and even its founding North Atlantic Treaty emphasizes
political and economic cooperation among the Allies (Parties).13

\(2\) NATO as an operational partner

NATO today can be characterized as an "alliance in action." In addition
to large-scale operations in Kosovo (KFOR) and Afghanistan (ISAF), NATO
is currently conducting an antiterrorism operation in the Mediterranean
(OAE), antipiracy measures off the coast of Somalia, and a training
mission in Iraq (NTM-I). Furthermore, from March to October 2011, NATO
conducted an operation over Libya. Many non-NATO countries, as well as
NATO Allies, are contributing troops to those operations and missions.
In the case of ISAF, for instance, in addition to all of the 28 NATO
countries, a total of around 20 non-members are participating as
Non-NATO Troop Contributing Nations (NNTCNs). The presence of non-member
contributors has grown considerably in the context of ISAF over the past
several years.14 In the past, Australia and New Zealand had contributed
troops to NATO-led operations in the former Yugoslavia, such as in
Bosnia in the 1990s. However, the current level of non-members'
involvement in NATO-led operations is truly a new phenomenon. One reason
behind this is the expansion of NATO's operational commitments beyond
the capacity of its members. In other words, it is impossible for the
Alliance to conduct all the operations alone as a self-sufficient
entity. At the same time, as most former communist countries in Europe
have already become members of the Alliance, the weight of the countries
outside the Euro--Atlantic region that used to be referred to as contact
countries ---Japan, Australia, Republic of Korea, New Zealand, etc.---
is increasing instead. From NATO's point of view, cooperation with new
partners is in essence an "import of support" 15 and NATO naturally
welcomes countries with the will and capabilities to contribute to the
operations that it leads.

On the other hand, operational cooperation with NATO is often an
effective means for nonmembers in terms of enhancing their efforts in
international peace and security, not least in the context of
international peace operations. Most of these operations today are
conducted multilaterally. What is more, looking at global trends in
international peace operations, it is clear that the weight of United
Nations-led peacekeeping operations (PKO) has been relatively decreasing
in recent years. In its place is a growing presence of peace operations
led by regional organizations such as NATO, the EU, and the African
Union (AU).16 While the activities of the AU are limited to
intra-regional operations on the African continent, NATO and EU
operations (other than territorial defense mission by NATO) are
basically assumed to take place outside of their member states.17

As a result of the expanding operational engagements of NATO and the EU
outside of Europe, other countries including Japan often find themselves
in a situation where they need to cooperate with NATO and the EU whether
they like it or not. When the ISAF operation in Afghanistan was launched
at the end of 2001, it was commanded on a half-year rotation by
countries with the will and capacity to command. However, due to cost
and complexities related to the establishment and maintenance of the
headquarters, NATO took over command in August 2003.18 Furthermore, ISAF
later expanded its area of responsibility and came to cover the whole
country. As a result, those who were deploying troops in Afghanistan had
no choice but to cooperate with NATO as long as they wanted to continue
their engagement. Seen from a different angle, it can also be said that
countries can use NATO as a framework through which to participate in
international efforts. Without such a framework, small to medium-sized
countries may not able to make contributions.

Nevertheless, there are various ways to pursue operational cooperation
with NATO. Potential contributors could complete official procedures,
including concluding a participation agreement with NATO, become a
troop-contributing country, and then deploy troops under the ISAF
command, or they could cooperate locally via individual arrangements
made with other countries already active in the area (without having
official relations with NATO).19 Theoretically, at least, it is even
possible for those countries to conduct a completely independent
operation on its own in Afghanistan. However, regardless of how
self-contained the activities are, the necessity to coordinate on issues
such as the division of roles with ISAF will of course come up, and it
is practically impossible to assume that the countries that endeavor to
send troops to Afghanistan could conduct its own activities without
relying on the capabilities and various infrastructure of ISAF at all,
including in extremis support and security information. Furthermore,
even assuming it is feasible, it will not be the most efficient way to
use the limited amount of resources available. In sum, it is not only in
NATO's interest, but also non-NATO troop contributors' interest to
cooperate with each other. Former NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop
Scheffer succinctly pointed out that, "NATO is a framework that they
\[nonmembers\] can use to make their own efforts more effective." 20
Furthermore, if a country completes official procedures with NATO and
takes position as an official ISAF troop contributing nation, they can
participate in various levels of ISAF meetings, receive more
information, and get more involved in policy-shaping.

For a number of constitutional, legal and domestic political reasons, it
is very difficult for the SDF to operate under the command of NATO.21
Short of coming under NATO's command, however, various options are
conceivable for the SDF to work with NATO in the areas where it
operates. At the same time, operational cooperation with NATO does not
need to be limited to the military domain alone. In Afghanistan, since
2007 Japan has provided humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in
cooperation with PRTs, and since 2009 has dispatched development experts
(civilian assistance teams) to the Lithuania-led PRT in Chaghcharan,
Ghor province.22 Assistance from Japan was of great value for Lithuania,
a country which does not have much funding and experience in development
assistance. From a Japanese point of view, the importance of this scheme
comes from the fact that it enables Japan to expand the geographical
reach of its development assistance beyond those areas where an Embassy
or the Japanese aid agency (JICA) are already present. Without the
cooperation of the Lithuania-led PRT, it is easy to imagine that Japan
would not have been able to operate in a remote province like Ghor.
Moreover, Japan and NATO concluded a security agreement in June 2010,
which allows Japan and NATO to share classified information with each
other.23 This is expected to be a foundation for deeper dialogue and
practical cooperation between Japan and NATO.24

\(3\) NATO as another venue of cooperation with the United States

The comparative advantage that [**[coop]{.mark}eration** **[with
NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} offers Japan, [[as **opposed** to
**bilat**]{.mark}**eral** **[coop]{.mark}eration** **[with]{.mark} major
[European countries]{.mark}** and with the EU]{.underline}, is the fact
that the US, Japan's only formal ally, is part of NATO. For all NATO
Allies excluding the US, what NATO means is essentially an alliance with
the US. When NATO was founded within the context of the Cold War, it was
primarily seen as a means to secure US commitment to defend Western
Europe. Moreover, for former communist nations that joined NATO after
the end of the Cold War, the NATO membership was synonymous with
receiving a commitment from the US for collective defense, exemplified
by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. For those reasons, NATO is
usually conceived in the context of policy toward the US in many
countries.

As [[for **security policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the pressure on
allies to shoulder a greater defense burden will initially increase
given a diminished ability and willingness of US domestic interests to
support overseas military commitments. [The **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates ["economizes" its military power to extract
economic advantages from its allies]{.underline}. Unlike in the realist
scenario, this policy is primarily driven by domestic interests, not
strategic considerations. As with economic policy, [[the

on a **bilat**]{.mark}**eral, [rather than multilat]{.mark}eral**,
[basis, as this **increases US leverage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To the
extent that security guarantees are maintained, at least initially,
allies will have to make economic and financial concessions -- in terms
of market access and resource transfers -- in order to preserve US
security commitments.

With NATO's attempts to create flexible, quasi-minilateral formats
within its own partnership program failing to produce lasting results to
this point, questions remain about what it can learn from [the increased
ad hoc approach to addressing various challenges]{.underline}. How does
the rise of minilateral arrangements impact NATO, what makes them
successful, and how can it apply the experiences of these various
formats to its own partnership policy?

**[[Minilat]{.mark}eral]{.underline}** or flexible [arrangements can

[While NATO navigated the "new challenge -- new format" issue,
**[minilat]{.mark}eral** [arrangements **thrived**]{.mark} in the
Euro-Atlantic space, **[proliferating]{.mark}** in the aftermath of
defining security events, from the end of the Cold War to 9/11. They
have gained new prominence [throughout the last
decade]{.mark}]{.underline} as NATO finds itself torn between competing
priorities and struggles to balance territorial defense and external
stabilization efforts. [**[Differences in threat perceptions]{.mark}**
among members in Eastern and Southern Europe have [added to this trend,
as have **internal political tensions**]{.mark} and a growing desire for
greater strategic autonomy among some European countries]{.underline}.

NATO's eastern flank has been a particularly fertile landscape for
minilateral formats. Events, from the 2007 cyberattack on Estonia to the
2008 Russo-Georgian war to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation
of Crimea, created a new impetus to enhance deterrence, readiness, and
exchange within and outside of NATO.

Newer regional initiatives built on longstanding cooperative efforts,
such as the Nordic Baltic 8, a regional format for political
consultations formally established in 2000 that engages Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden.

In 2009, the Nordic Defense Cooperation was launched as a collaborative
and voluntary effort between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and
Sweden to strengthen these countries' defense capabilities and strategic
regional exchange. The Northern Group, which was established in 2010 by
the United Kingdom as a forum to discuss common defense and security
issues, has a wider geographical reach.8

The Bucharest 9, in contrast, is a minilateral format that includes all
allies on NATO's Eastern Flank--- from Estonia in the North to Bulgaria
in the South. Although it is independent of NATO, it is closely aligned
with the alliance, with representatives meeting on the sidelines of NATO
summits.9

Recent years have also seen a rise in broader ad hoc groupings among
European nations that create capacity to respond to crises. In this
regard, the French-driven European Intervention Initiative (EI2)10
received significant attention. It is a lean, relatively informal
structure that aims to drive a common strategic culture among
participating European nations. It is deliberately independent of NATO
and the EU to create a high degree of flexibility. Besides France, EU
member states Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Italy, are part of the
initiative, as well as non-EU countries, Norway and the United Kingdom.

The EI2's primary focus is exchange, collaboration, and planning to
better position participating nations to act quickly in a crisis.
Underscoring its agility, a joint statement by EI2 Defense Ministers
published at their second ministerial meeting in 2019 describes the
initiative as "a flexible, resource-neutral and non-binding forum, where
all the Participants are equal."11 And while members are not bound to
participate in any operations, the format is designed to help prepare
them to work together in potential future missions as part of NATO, the
EU, UN, or other ad hoc groupings.

Part of the rationale for the EI2 initiative was the French Defense
Ministry's exasperation with time consuming and excessive consultations
between NATO members in crisis situations---a conclusion colored by
experiences including the 2013 intervention in Mali and the 2015 Paris
terrorist attacks.12 The EI2 is designed to speed up this process by
establishing a shared strategic culture that will make it possible to
respond to crises more quickly. It enables European nations to set up
groupings that can act swiftly and step in to act independently of
larger institutions or lay the groundwork for larger operation overseen
by the UN, NATO or the EU.

The EI2 [[underscores **frustration with NATO's consensus
structure**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the multi-body governance process
of the EU. Both institutions are not known for quick decision making. As
such, the EI2 could be an enabling asset in a crisis, but it also calls
into question some of the core tasks assigned to NATO. Specifically,
there are certain redundancies with other efforts, including some
endorsed by NATO like the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force (see further
below). Moreover, it remains to be seen if significant divergences
between the EI2 members in terms of strategic cultures -- including
their willingness to engage in conflict13 -- can really produce any
successes absent the larger institutional momentum provided by an
organization like NATO or the EU once they achieve consensus.

The EI2 was launched in the wake of French disappointments with the
Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which was established in 2017
to jointly develop defense capabilities within the EU. Although PESCO is
part of the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy, participation is
voluntary and is open to those "capable and willing."14 The degree of
integration became a sticking point for this format. For instance,
France envisioned a selective initiative with more capable EU member
states, leading to a leaner structure and a greater level of ambition.15
Ultimately, Germany's vision of a more inclusive model prevailed with
all but two EU member states (Denmark and Malta) joining PESCO. In
contrast, the EI2's "small, but mighty" scope is more in line with
President Emmanuel Macron's vision of European leadership.

Establishing Shared Standards and Procedures

The United States and its allies prioritize establishing shared
standards and procedures to ensure that they have the ability to
coordinate effectively in a potential conflict. Liaisons and personnel
exchanges provide a way to sustain enduring relationships between U.S.
and allied militaries. [[The **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [**[conducts SC activities on a
bilateral basis]{.mark}**, engaging allies in liaison and military
personnel exchange programs]{.underline}. The United Kingdom has as many
as 15 liaison officers and 13 exchange officers placed in Army commands.
These officers have the opportunity to share information on operational
procedures, which helps build and sustain long-term interoperability
between the two armies.19

[Defense and military contacts, which are more short-term, also provide
a means for sharing information]{.underline}. The contacts include
army-to-army staff talks and key leader and senior leader engagements.
According to G-TSCMIS, Australia and the United Kingdom have the highest
number of SC engagements among highly capable partners, including
planning conferences, bilateral and multilateral coordination meetings,
and staff talks; the majority of these engagements are focused on
interoperability.

[**[Multilateral engagements]{.mark}** and [such]{.mark} organizations
[as **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and ABCANZ [[provide mechanisms
for]{.mark} developing [shared]{.mark} standards for the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its **allies**.
NATO Standardization Agreements, for example, provide the basis for
developing common operational and administrative procedures and
logistics that enable one NATO country to operate with and support
another member's military forces]{.underline}. ABCANZ focuses on
developing common standards for the land forces of the highly capable
allies. Regional working groups have also developed in recent years to
serve as an institutional mechanism to share information. Together,
[they have become part of an emerging **[SC planning]{.mark} process**

Question. Several NATO allies have expressed concern about the

The 2014 Wales Summit then gave rise to other options. [Members endorsed
the Framework Nations Concept (FNC), proposed by Germany]{.underline} in
2013, [as a viable flexible format within NATO]{.underline}.
[[**Voluntary** and **bottom-up**]{.mark}, this [approach enables
**individual NATO members**]{.mark}---or framework nations---[to work
with a **limited set of other members** to fill]{.mark} critical
capability and operational [gaps]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The FNC model
[creates **more formal**]{.mark} groupings and **[commitment]{.mark}**
among the participants]{.underline} than the +N model. Against the
backdrop of strained defense budgets and varying threat perceptions, it
was designed to combine the limited resources of large and small
European members while decreasing redundancies. The concept builds on
those of NATO's "Smart Defense" and the EU's "Pooling and Sharing,"
taking a step further by creating a more structured, coordinated
approach focused on outputs and measuring success against national
capability targets set in NATO's Defense Planning Process.

Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom, as larger and more capable
"framework nations," head separate FNC initiatives. Although these
differ quite significantly, there is [a common denominator: they are
**voluntary**, **multinational frameworks** led by members [focused on
**furthering NATO's mission**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They **may often
rely on** the alliance's organizational and command structure,
**yet**]{.mark} they **[remain independent]{.mark}** of its operational
structures]{.underline}. And all three have been expanded to include
non-NATO countries, serving as an important link between the alliance
and its partners.

[[Given that **participation**]{.mark} of [and **consensus among all
NATO members is not required**]{.mark}, the]{.underline} FNC
[initiatives [provide **greater flexibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Focusing on capability development, the German-led FNC group has taken a
more inclusive approach with 21 members and partners participating in a
variety of working groups or clusters.16 The FNC groups led by Italy and
the United Kingdom are more selective, building on each countries'
specific expertise in crisis management and military readiness. The
Italian group,17 which is the least developed at this point, focuses on
multinational formations, operations, and potential capability
development.18 Meanwhile, the United Kingdom used the FNC as an
opportunity to reinvigorate its efforts to create a Joint Expeditionary
Force (JEF), a multinational high-readiness force with the participation
of Nordic, Baltic, and Western European countries.

Dynamics between the structural and situational factors: the theoretical
model This book argues that certain structural and situational factors
are necessary to establish a new defence cooperation in Europe.
Structural factors are understood as institutions, solid and
long-standing relationships, trends and perceptions that had been
developed for a relatively long period. Normally, they create the wider
conditions for collaborations but they cannot trigger the launch of new
MDCs per se. Situational factors relate to the political and economic
environment, personal relationships that might change relatively
quickly. These elements create a situation that provide favourable
circumstances and a window of opportunity to establish a new defence
collaboration.

The structural factors are:

1\) the existence of the European security community;

2\) the perception that individual European armed forces do not have
appropriate funds for defence;

3\) previous defence collaborations between the participating states.

The situational factors are:

1\) strong leadership by a group of enthusiastic high-level officials
and good interpersonal chemistry between them;

2\) a supportive political milieu for the defence cooperation.

levels of MDCs in Europe

height="1.3354188538932634in"}

The dynamics between these factors can be explained by two figures.
Figure 9.1 shows how the subregional level processes interact with the
first structural factor: the existence of the European security
community. Figure 9.2 highlights what happens on the subregional level
regarding the other two structural and two situational factors.

Figure 9.1 points out that [the existence of the European security
community has an impact on the subregional level and]{.underline} that
[[developments on the **subregional** level]{.underline}]{.mark} can
[[**have an impact** on]{.mark} the [European-level security
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}. This structural factor is the most
relevant precondition for creating MDCs in Europe because the members of
the European security community do not intend to solve their problems
militarily with each other, as they share similar identities, perceive
their interests similarly and understand the concept of security in the
same way. This created an environment in Europe where cooperation
instead of confrontation has become the dominant trait in military
affairs in the European security community. Furthermore,
[[through]{.mark} institutionalized **[security coop]{.mark}eration**
[in **NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the EU, [[different DPCs create
new shared]{.mark} meanings (for example, concepts, approaches,
**[policies]{.mark}**) in this community [by **uploading** their
approaches **from the subregional to the European
level**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And DPCs also download shared meanings
from the European level to the subregional level [when they learn them
socially through different transactions and communications]{.underline}.
This can be seen in Figure 9.1 which shows that [NATO and EU processes
influence the subregional level and vice versa]{.underline}. This also
means that only NATO and/or EU members are part of this security
community and it does not include every European country.

Figure 9.2 explains the dynamics on the subregional level, which is at
the bottom of Figure 9.1. Accordingly, Figure 9.2 highlights how the
remaining four factors interact with each other on the subregional level
regarding the DPC of one country. When we analyse the creation of a
defence collaboration, we have to analyse the most relevant DPCs in the
studied defence collaboration.

Figure 9.2 looks like an hourglass where the 'sand' of the two
structural factors related to previous defence collaborations and
perception about the defence budgets slowly trickles down, creating
'options' for defence cooperation on the bottom part of the hourglass.
Based on this, the studied DPC, which sits in the middle of the
hourglass, has several available options (circles) for defence
collaborations with other DPCs of the European security community.
However, the 'potential options' (black circles), which are based on
stronger previous partnerships and similar perceptions about their
defence budgets of two or more DPCs, will be likely realized if the
situational factors are in place. These situational factors work as
filters that retain certain potential options from 'falling down' to the
bottom of the hourglass and this way they can become defence
collaborations. The filters created by the situational factors can stop
only 'potential options' as they are more robust. However, when the
situational factors related to 'personal relationships' and the
'political milieu' are not properly in line, they cannot work as filters
and even the 'potential options' fall down and none of the options will
become an MDC.

Figure 9.2: Interaction of the factors in defence cooperation in Europe

**\[Figure 9.2 OMITTED\]**

On the top half of the hourglass, the structural factor of 'the
perception that individual European armed forces do not have appropriate
funds for defence' reflects the widely shared view among DPCs that, in
general, European militaries do not have enough funds to have every
military capability they need. These perceived scarce budgetary
resources can be mitigated by cooperation. However, as we saw in Chapter
5, DPCs do not necessarily create new collaborations because of a
budgetary famine as happened after the 2008 financial crisis. In such
crisis situations, they focus on themselves instead of looking for new
collaborations and do not have the resources to cooperate. Rather, the
long-term perception of the lack of resources is the key element for
them in cooperation. The other structural factor points out that
[previous defence [collaborations create **path-dependencies**]{.mark}
and thus there is a bigger chance that a new MDC will be established
among existing partners]{.underline}. The four [[**self-reinforcing
mechanisms** incentivize]{.mark} the [**already collaborating DPCs**
to]{.mark} stay or **[expand]{.mark}** their defence cooperation
further]{.underline}. First, the already invested set-up costs in the
form of collaborative frameworks, agreements and practical cooperation
urge the DPCs to continue working together. Second, during the
collaboration process, they also learn to cooperate with each other more
effectively, which is called learning effects. [When they **start to
benefit from coordinating** their activities **with other DPCs** in the
form of coordination effects, it also **reinforces existing
collaborations** instead of replacing them with totally new
ones]{.underline}. Finally, adaptive expectations come into play when
DPCs believe that the cooperation that has worked in the past will work
in the future too, so they are willing to invest more into them.

These two structural factors related to previous defence collaborations
and perceptions about the defence budget have been evolving slowly and
creating options for collaborations for DPCs. These options can be seen
on the bottom half of the hourglass in Figure 9.2. In principle, a DPC
can establish a new MDC with any other DPC in the European security
community with which it had a certain level of defence cooperation in
the past and perceive the inadequacy of its defence budget similarly to
the other DPC.1 These are the available options. However, some options
have a better chance to be materialized because of deeper partnerships
between DPCs in the past and more similar views about their defence
budgets. These are the potential options. If the situational factors are
in place, they work as filters and stop these potential options falling
down in the 'hourglass' and trigger the creation of an MDC.

One of these situational factors is the 'strong leadership of a group of
enthusiastic high-level officials and good interpersonal chemistry
between them'. Without actual people, structures per se will not
establish new collaborations, meaning that at least two leaders have to
work actively on launching the MDC. These stakeholders usually like each
other and this interpersonal attraction helps them to work together more
effortlessly. Scholarship in psychology highlights that propinquity and
similarity are key in developing interpersonal attraction. Propinquity
is crucial because it is almost impossible to develop interpersonal
attraction without a chance of coming in contact with a person. If
people regularly interact, in most cases, they start to like each other
more. This happens thanks to the mere exposure effect which explains
that, as a result of increased engagement with someone or something,
they become familiar to us and become more predictable and less
threatening. In the case of creating MDCs, the propinquity is often
established through several official meetings in different settings.
Although propinquity can help to develop a relationship to a certain
extent, similarity between individuals in relevant areas also plays a
crucial role. If two people are similar to each other in terms of their
attitudes, experience, social class and so on, they can better
understand each other, build trust faster and their communication
becomes more effortless and straightforward.

The other situational factor is the 'supportive political milieu towards
subregional multinational defence cooperation'. This is relevant
because, although the structural factors and the situational factor of
strong leadership and interpersonal chemistry between the leaders might
be present, without the supportive political milieu, the leaders would
work in a political vacuum and could not launch a new MDC successfully.
The political milieu works on two levels: on the microenvironment and
the macroenvironment. The microenvironment is where the discourse and
the policy formulation about possible military cooperation happens
inside a DPC and between relevant DPCs. The macroenvironment can be
understood as the events and relationship patterns that are significant
to get support for creating the MDC from outside the DPCs. The
relationships between the events of the microenvironment and
macroenvironment are dynamic. Occasionally, the macroenvironment is
supportive towards certain MDCs, but sometimes the DPCs in the
microenvironment intend to shape their macroenvironment to get support
for launching a new defence collaboration. In this context, the DPCs are
making sense, telling stories and naming certain issues to frame
policies based on the interactions between the micro and
macroenvironments of the political milieu.

Based on these structural and situational factors and the model that is
describing the dynamics between them in Figure 9.1 and Figure 9.2, we
can analyse how and why certain MDCs are created. The next sections of
this chapter will briefly explain the launch of the Lancaster House
Treaties, the NORDEFCO and CEDC, applying this model and using the
insights of the previous chapters. The Lancaster House Treaties The
Lancaster House Treaties between France and the UK were signed by the
French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the British Prime Minister, David
Cameron, on 2 November 2010. In the treaties, the two DPCs agreed on
cooperating on several areas such as capability development and
procurement, defence industry, research and development, common
deployments, nuclear deterrents and so on.

[One of the reasons why]{.underline} the French and British [DPCs pushed
for]{.underline} this [defence cooperation was that they were
dissatisfied with the developments at the European level. [They were
**highly influential** in shaping]{.mark} the shared meanings of [the
European security community]{.mark} as they [often **uploaded**
their]{.mark} approaches, concepts and [**policies**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the EU and **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Figure 9.1). For instance, together they launched the ESDP in the late
1990s and regularly pushed for new initiatives either alone with others.
[However, towards the end of the first decade of the 2000s]{.underline},
both [DPCs were **disillusioned with NATO**]{.underline} and EU
[processes]{.underline}. The British DPC had been mostly dissatisfied
with the contribution of European DPCs to military missions in Iraq and
Afghanistan and the low level of defence budgets of European armed
forces. The members of the British DPC were very vocal about these
issues [and concluded that practical **bilateral cooperation** with
partners who possess similar military capabilities was a **better
option** than **large multinational solutions**]{.underline}. France was
an obvious option for this and the French reintegration to the NATO's
military wing in 2009 made the collaboration even easier. The French DPC
had a similarly negative view about EU level processes, but as Paris
invested more into EU-level military cooperation than in NATO
partnerships its dissatisfaction was mostly about the lack of progress
in EU defence. Partially, this disillusionment about the EU was the
reason why France reintegrated into NATO's military wing in 2009 and
also looked for practical cooperation with credible partners such as the
UK. Thus, [these European-level processes (reluctant allies to
contribute to defence efforts in NATO]{.underline} and EU and French
reintegration to NATO) [had a significant impact on the thinking
of]{.underline} the British and French [DPCs on the subregional
level]{.underline}.

In terms of the second structural factor, the British DPC had 'the
perception that it had not appropriate funds' for achieving all of its
goals and the reluctance of European allies to share the burden made
Britain frustrated. At the same time, the large defence budget cuts that
the British MoD suffered after the 2008 financial crisis did not
incentivize the British DPC to look for alternative multinational
solutions to maintain some of its capabilities. The MoD rather focused
on national solutions by cutting back capabilities and commitments. The
French Armed Forces did not immediately suffer from big defence budget
cuts as its British counterpart did, but several military equipment
programmes were slowed down and delayed significantly. However, the
financial crisis did not trigger the French DPC to look for
multinational solutions either. In the cases of the French and British
DPCs, rather, the long-standing trend of the eroding of the value of the
defence budget contributed to the idea that strengthening the
cooperation with already existing pragmatic partners was desirable.

The British and French DPCs had worked together for decades on defence
before the Lancaster House Treaties, highlighting the third structural
factor (previous collaborations) which is often necessary for creating a
new MDC. They invested the large set-up costs by establishing
cooperative frameworks and agreements already in place from the 1970s
and 1980s. As they started to cooperate more, they experienced the
learning and coordinating effects by learning to work together more
effectively and also experienced the benefits from their cooperation. As
in the 1990s, these processes led to adaptive expectations, namely the
British and French DPCs holding the belief that their cooperation could
work in the future too. Thanks to these developments, the French and
British DPCs established plenty of defence collaborations on different
levels after the end of the Cold War that created even more
path-dependencies for them.

Thus, the structural factors about the perception to the lack of funds
for defence and the previous defence cooperation between the French and
British DPCs created a 'potential option' for collaboration (Figure
9.2). Although this 'potential option' existed previously, the presence
of the two situational factors was needed for the launch of the
Lancaster House Treaties. The first situational factor was that the
French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the British Prime Minister, David
Cameron, showed strong leadership and had interpersonal chemistry. This
relationship was built through experiencing the mere exposure effect
through repeated interactions in official and semi-official meetings
bilaterally and in multinational settings. In addition, they were
similar in relevant aspects, which helped them to develop interpersonal
attraction quickly. First, they belonged to the same political family,
which was very unique for an incumbent British Prime Minister and French
President, as it was the case for only two years in the 21st century so
far. Second, Sarkozy was much more pro-UK and pro-US than his
predecessors. Thus, he was seen as someone who was more similar to
Western political leaders, which made it easier for Cameron to accept
and trust Sarkozy.

The second situational factor was the positive political milieu towards
this MDC. [In the microenvironment (the level of the DPCs)]{.underline},
the French and British DPCs [were supportive for deeper pragmatic
collaborations]{.underline} with each other. Thanks to their
aforementioned dissatisfactions in the NATO and EU-level processes,
France's reintegration to NATO, the perception of lack of funding and
decades-long British--French defence cooperation, they saw the potential
for a new, deeper collaboration between them in a positive light. The
macroenvironments of the two DPCs were their domestic political
environments where leading politicians intended to use the Lancaster
House Treaties for mostly domestic, political purposes and
framed-related policy decisions. The British Prime Minister intended to
demonstrate to the Eurosceptic wing of the Tory party that he could
cooperate with other European countries outside the EU successfully. At
the same time, Sarkozy needed to show France's domestic audience and its
European partners that France was proactive and a leading nation in
defence after the ESDP stalled. Although certain differences emerged in
the French and British policy discourse regarding the Lancaster House
Treaties, essentially, the French and British DPCs had similar
approaches. They emphasized the commonalities between their countries
while ignoring their differences to gain support.

As shown, the dynamics concerning the five factors fostered the creation
of the Lancaster House Treaties. Namely, the British and French [DPCs
were [**frustrated** with]{.mark} the developments on the European-level
defence collaborations in]{.underline} the EU and [**[NATO]{.mark}**,
**[perceiving]{.mark}** that, in general, they did **[not]{.mark}**
receive **[enough resources]{.mark}** to fund themselves properly. This
[led to]{.mark} the conclusion]{.underline} for both DPCs [that they
needed to **[strengthen existing]{.mark} pragmatic [partnerships instead
of focusing on]{.mark} large multinational solutions** in]{.underline}
the EU and **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As the French and British
DPCs cooperated for decades before the Lancaster House Treaties,
[[**existing path-dependencies** pushed them to work even more closely
together, creating a]{.mark} potential option for a **[new
MDC]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This potential option was materialized in
the Lancaster House Treaties. The fact that Nicolas Sarkozy and David
Cameron liked each other helped them to easily work together and, for
different reasons, the political milieu in both countries were
supportive towards this new MDC.

Similarly, **[[authorities]{.underline}]{.mark}** that restrict
activities to specific mission areas [[are **seen as
inflexible**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the face of quickly emerging
threats, making it difficult to build partner capacity in intended
mission areas and further [impelling [SC personnel]{.mark} to **["game"

2001 and until recently, the priority for U.S. national security
strategy and for SC (and DoD activity in particular) has been
counterterrorism.24 Congress established Section 1206 and many other
recent SC authorities on the basis of the need to rapidly respond (and
help partners respond) to threats from al-Qaeda and more recently the
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). But as the CT mission area
has been addressed in the past ten to 15 years, [other missions have
emerged that are becoming priorities for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its partners but that are **[not explicitly
covered]{.mark}**]{.underline} under the CT rubric (or under "stability
operations," another area addressed in authorities). [These other
emerging areas include **cyber** warfare and **"hybrid" warfare** of the
type Russia has utilized to subjugate eastern Ukraine and annex
Crimea]{.underline} (gaps are also addressed in a subsequent section of
this chapter). Capstone DoD strategic planning guidance that defines
priorities and directs the efforts of the CCMDs also identifies
nontraditional threats, such as transnational border security, maritime
security, and foreign fighters.25 [While Congress and the administration
have created some specific programs to bolster Ukraine and eastern
**[NATO]{.mark}** allies]{.underline},26 [existing authorities do not
provide the flexibility for **[SC personnel]{.mark}** to pursue these
mission areas]{.underline} in other nations or regions. [Thus, they [are

Three other limitations or gaps have been raised in numerous discussions
with SC personnel in DoD. We indicated above that [**[DoD]{.mark}** has
been **[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline} in some authorities [[to
**working only with**]{.mark} foreign forces associated with **[national
defense agencies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Emerging transnational threats
and mission areas require the ability to work with interior agency
forces or other gendarme or civil authorities when their security forces
retain primary responsibility for those mission areas or operate in
close collaboration with MoDs. For example, in many cases, the ministry
or department of interior is responsible for securing national
infrastructure and cyber assets; of six countries CENTCOM officials are
engaging on infrastructure security, only in Jordan is the military
responsible for protecting the country's infrastructure.66

[A second gap in Title 10 authorities is in the flexibility for DoD to
work with **regional organizations** rather than just **bilaterally**
with national governments. Under Title 10, **[even regional
programs]{.mark}**]{.underline} (such as the Counterterrorism
Partnership Fund \[CTPF\]) [[are **implemented bilaterally**]{.mark}
with national governments. [There are **no mechanisms** for]{.mark}
training and equipping **[regional
organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.67 When this limitation is combined
with the limitation on U.S. military engagement with non-MoD security
forces, it inhibits the U.S. ability to facilitate coordination among
agencies with similar responsibilities within and across partners to
have regional effects and to address local security threats.68

Security Assistance Training. In the case of certain kinds of security
assistance training, the demanders believe that the demand exceeds by a
large margin the available seats in U.S. Army schoolhouses and the
funding available for International Military Education and Training.7
According to the interviewees, in some cases demand exceeds supply to
such an extent that the shortfalls have affected the overall UCC theater

Other defense cooperation structures, like JEF and strategic
[**[bilat]{.mark}eral [partnerships]{.mark}** can support
**interoperability** and developing **new capabilities**]{.underline},
but they might [also [offer **flexible** mechanisms]{.mark} for
responding to crises where NATO as a whole would be unwilling or unable
to act]{.underline}. On the other hand, [there [might be pressure to
**downscale**]{.mark} some of the other elements of defense cooperation
[in]{.mark} the [fear]{.mark} that [they would be **too
duplicative**]{.mark}]{.underline} or forcing Finland to spread its
efforts too thin. [In the end, Finland [would **calibrate its network
of**]{.mark} **defense [coop]{.mark}eration** [in the way that **adds
most value**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

One area where **[[bilat]{.mark}eral [coop]{.mark}eration [will not drop
off]{.mark}]{.underline}**, however, is very clear. [[**Every country in
NATO** cherishes their **bilat**]{.mark}**eral** defense
[coop]{.mark}eration [with the **US**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Finland
would not be an exception. Finland would want to continue and deepen
that bilateral cooperation, while understanding the longer-term trends
of strategic competition will force the United States to focus its gaze
more on the Indo-Pacific region.

When it comes to multilateral decision-making, as a general rule Finland
avoids situations where it is politically isolated or even in a small
minority. In multilateral fora that often means a forceful support to an
emerging consensus. In substance terms, this would likely include
underlining the role of the transatlantic relationship but balancing it
with a regional and European approach.

Another natural path would be to focus heavily on cooperation with
neighboring countries like Norway and, naturally, Sweden; in fact, with
all five Nordic nations in the alliance, a greater NATO focus on the
high north would seem likely to emerge.

Multilateralism is likely to stick: Two [key strands]{.underline} of
Finnish security and defense policy [[would **likely be
continued**]{.mark} in NATO: a focus on **bilateral** and
**minilateral** defense cooperation mechanisms]{.underline} and support
to the EU's evolving security and defense policy.

Although it was hesitant until the around the time of the ratification
of the Lisbon treaty, Finland has been a strong proponent of the EU
defense policy ever since. This has been partially motivated by Finland
being outside NATO but, more importantly, by the understanding that the
EU is a broad security community with a sizeable toolbox of policies and
capabilities. [There are longstanding tensions between the EU and NATO
on defense issues]{.underline}; as the newest alliance members, and
hence high-profile, it is possible [Sweden and Finland could play a role
in **bridging that gap**]{.underline}.

Roadblocks to Rethinking Partnerships

While the need for NATO to adapt its partnership model for today's
challenges has been detailed, there are several significant hurdles to
any reform effort. First, [institutions are slow to change and NATO is
certainly not immune to this dynamic. **[NATO's consensus-based]{.mark}
approach to [decision making only exacerbates]{.mark}** this---[allowing
**one member**]{.mark} of an increasingly diverse alliance [to
**block**]{.mark} the action of the other 29 given related [or
**unrelated political**]{.mark} **reasons**]{.underline}. [This puts any
transformation in NATO's]{.underline} partnership [policy at the mercy
of complicated political and institutional dynamics]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, [the more **"[hostage taking]{.mark}"** policy-making or
lowest-common-denominator thinking persists in alliance realities, the
[**less likely** it is going to be the **institution of first
resort**]{.mark} for]{.underline} partners (and [members]{.underline}).
[To avoid this, [members]{.mark}]{.underline} and partners may [[**opt**
for the]{.underline}]{.mark} second **[["bottom-up"
approach]{.underline}]{.mark}** advocated above. [[A **more informal**
initiation that **docks into NATO rather than formally overseen by
NATO**]{.mark} could **prove its utility** to the alliance's strategic
priorities and play on NATO flexibility through the +N
format]{.underline}.

Second, NATO's ability to adapt and set out a more ambitious,
organizationally driven partnership policy is hampered by its own
staffing bandwidth. NATO international staff are already responsible for
a broad spectrum of activities across the organization's core tasks. As
such, a more flexible model following the parameters of the FNC may
prove useful. While NATO officials should play a role in driving the key
issues framing the partnership clusters, the real burden of organizing
political dialogue and capacity building could be offloaded to the lead
nations under the auspices of NATO. This would allow for an
institution-driven approach without posing too heavy a burden for the
already understaffed organization.

Third, [the [**lessons learned** from **failed expectations**]{.mark}
around various partnership frameworks or mechanisms [have resulted in
**aversion to assembling new ones**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the
partnership menu has grown and various outdated mechanisms have accrued,
[[thinking **beyond bilat**]{.mark}**eral** or trilateral [**ad hoc**
groupings is **seen as outmoded**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It will take a
creative and ambitious approach to combine NATO's more flexible +N
tendencies with a broader and more deliberate partnership strategy to
various interest-based issues that NATO leadership and key members need
to tackle together.

Finally, political leadership within the alliance has been critical in
moving discussions forward when institutional jams occur. This role has
mostly fallen to the United States. But recent years have increased
doubts as to whether the United States will, or should, continue to play
the same role it has in the past. Recent unilateral U.S. foreign policy
decisions like the decision to withdraw troops from Germany have eroded
trust in the United States as a reliable partner among some members.
While President Joe Biden has already indicated a return to treaty-based
alliance politics, growing demands facing the United States in other
regions, including the Indo-Pacific, as well as at home, will continue
to focus policymakers attention and divert resources from the
Euro-Atlantic space. A continued absence of strong leadership that can
serve as a unifying force within the alliance when political cohesion
issues arise will be detrimental to moving any ambitious reforms
forward, including NATO partnerships.

Given this, NATO members other than the United States will have to play
a greater leadership role in the alliance and help to drive issues that
align with their security interests in cooperation with partners.
Moreover, if NATO partnerships are to stay relevant for all members,
including the United States, a more global outlook is inevitable. This
is a clear principle guiding the NATO 2030 effort.

Conclusion

Partnerships have been a core component of NATO's work to strengthen
transatlantic security and defense since the end of the Cold War. But as
the security environment changed, its partnership policy increasingly
lagged. [**[Large]{.mark} and bulky [partnership mechanisms are no
longer]{.mark} as [useful]{.mark}** as they once were and **[NATO's
success]{.mark}** in creating a more flexible approach to partnerships
[has been **limited**]{.mark}, often [engaging **only
bilaterally**]{.mark}]{.underline} or trilaterally, [[while **other
efforts have lost momentum**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such inefficiencies
in leveraging partnerships are an opportunity lost for members and
partners.

With NATO's attempts to create flexible, quasi-minilateral formats

this point, questions remain about what it can learn from [the increased
ad hoc approach to addressing various challenges]{.underline}. How does
the rise of minilateral arrangements impact NATO, what makes them
successful, and how can it apply the experiences of these various
formats to its own partnership policy?

**[[Minilat]{.mark}eral]{.underline}** or flexible [arrangements can

Although participation in coalition operations has varied greatly from
situation to situation and over time (see Table A.4), a number of allies
have been particularly reliable in their participation in recent
coalitions in which the United States has also participated.

As shown in Table A.4, the most frequent NATO coalition partners in the
40 operations examined were the United Kingdom (29 of 40 operations),
France (28), Turkey (23), Germany (22), and Italy and the Netherlands
(21 each). Other NATO allies participated in fewer actions with the
United States.

\[Table A.2 OMITTED\]

The implications are twofold. The first is that
[**[interoperability]{.mark}** planning [**must** be
**adaptive**]{.mark} enough [to accommodate]{.mark} the possibility of
[**coalitions** of **different sizes** and]{.mark} composed of different
coalition **[partners]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
["**[Plug-and-play]{.mark}**" is a concept that is well known at the
technological level. But it [is]{.mark} **also [required at the national
level]{.mark}** to provide for the possibility of different combinations
of coalition partners; to manage the comings and goings of coalition
members as the mission focus changes and/or missions are added,
completed, or abandoned; and [to **minimize disruptions**]{.mark} to the
overall coalition effort. This suggests]{.underline} a focus on
long-term interoperability solutions, including organizations, doctrine,
procedures, and system architectures that can accommodate the dynamic
character of coalitions, including transitions.

\[Table A.3 OMITTED\]

The second implication is [that [because]{.mark} the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [**[NATO allies vary]{.mark}** in their coalition
participation]{.underline} with the United States, [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [might
be able to [**achieve important interoperability** through]{.mark} a
series of [**bilateral rather than alliance-wide**

development or multinational formations such as Eurocorps -- all
[designed to increase the capacity of the military to work together --
have existed for a long time]{.underline}. New initiatives such as
NATO's strategic airlift consortium further advance this thinking and
practice. We are already witnessing the dividends of these approaches in
operations in Afghanistan. Certainly, there are many areas where this
must be taken further and produce more -- all very well illustrated by
capability gaps in operations in Libya: air-to-air refuelling, ISTAR,
combat SAR, tactical airlift etc. It does not matter through what sort
of arrangement or under which nation's lead this is delivered, as long
as it is actually delivered rather than producing the very modest
results of many past initiatives (DCI, PCC etc.) or projects (e.g.
helicopter initiative in NATO). Civilian capabilities will also have to
be enhanced through cooperative efforts such as the Weimar initiative,
since the management of many contemporary crises requires civilian
inputs.

Prompted by the crisis, [we often talk about spending [on **new
capabilities** such as **cyber**]{.mark}, but this cannot become a
substitute for investing in real capabilities]{.underline} (cyber would
have been of little use in Libya or against the Taliban) and doing it in
a collective, coordinated manner. [New approaches are needed to obtain
those capabilities]{.underline}, especially doing away with many
duplicate programmes in Europe. In the United States, despite the
inherent waste of a large defence organisation, the military manage to
derive a greater value from their investments than the Europeans. [**[If
Europeans continue]{.mark}** in their **current approach** of just
[**shrinking** their]{.mark} "total war" [force instead of
**reconfiguring it**]{.mark} properly for the age of "limited wars",
[the **Americans will simply turn away and leave**]{.mark}.
[The]{.mark}ir [**executive branch** and]{.mark} the [**military**
**realise**]{.mark} very well that even [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[**[cannot achieve everything alone]{.mark}** and must cooperate with
its allies and partners in Europe, [**but** this may **not arrest** the
**growing sentiment of giving up on Europe**]{.mark} felt [in the
**legislative branch**]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the other hand, some of
the fault for the capability gaps and the steep decline in conventional
heavy capabilities in Europe rests with the United States: many
Europeans wanted to shine in the "coalitions of the willing" led by the
Americans and therefore developed capabilities which bought influence
instead of producing military effectiveness.

["Pooling and sharing" [will **work best** if]{.mark} it comes [in a
**"bottom up"**, **pragmatic** fashion]{.mark}]{.underline} -- much in
the way of the recent UK-France defence cooperation agreements -- and if
they are linked [**[with U.S.]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline}.
[Indeed, [it is **likely** that]{.mark} **most** of the [**workable**
arrangements will be **bilateral**]{.mark} and **multi-bilateral**
[rather than]{.mark} genuinely **[multilateral]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
["**Pooling and sharing**" has its [limits]{.mark}, some of which [arise
from the **difficulties encountered** in **agreeing upon** and then
**implementing**]{.mark} decisions in a **[consensus-based
decision-making]{.mark}** culture [in]{.mark}]{.underline} organisations
such as **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the EU. [More fundamentally,
however, **diverging strategic cultures in Europe** mean that there is
**no common threat perception** and no common understanding of why and
in what circumstances the use of military force is necessary and
appropriate, which may **render "pooled and shared" assets and
capabilities unusable**]{.underline}. There are interventionist
countries keen on using force to advance interests and values, and those
who exercise extreme caution and would reserve the use of force for the
defence of the Alliance's territory. (This was illustrated by the
challenges of reaching a common position with regard to NATO's
intervention in Libya.)

### Solvency -- AI

#### It's better suited to SC in AI in particular

Bilateral Military AI Agreements and Cooperative S&T Blueprints

Whereas the two tools above consist of structured opportunities for
military AI cooperation, [a host of other initiatives offer additional
useful ways forward [on **military AI
coop**]{.mark}**eration**]{.underline}. The selection here focuses on
[**[bilat]{.mark}eral AI [agreements]{.mark}** that [**create linkages**
to foreign]{.mark} national security [**innovation**
bases]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as pathways that do not yet orient
toward AI but could with only minor adjustments.

Bilateral Military AI Cooperation Agreements

[[DOD already has many]{.mark} project [arrangements that create ad hoc
coop]{.mark}eration [opportunities]{.mark} with defense technology
communities in other countries, but only a small number of recent
initiatives target new forms of military AI cooperation]{.underline}. 55
This section focuses on two such formats, one with Singapore and the
other with the U.K. Military AI collaboration is already taking place.
The JAIC technology collaboration with the Singapore Defence Science and
Technology Agency, agreed in June 2019, is different from other
AI-related project arrangements in that it names a specific area of
cooperation, and is not necessarily service-specific.56 This
collaboration focuses on the mutual operational interest of humanitarian
assistance and disaster relief, a relatively noncontroversial area.57
[This [**echoes** calls from **several analysts** to begin]{.mark}
international military [AI coop]{.mark}eration [with **lower stakes**
and]{.mark} the possibility to **[scale into larger
initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.58

The centralization of AI efforts in the JAIC may [portend [an eventual
**hub-and-spokes** model]{.mark} for cooperation]{.underline}. This is
because its location and reporting structure in the Office of the
Secretary of Defense (OSD) could promote coordination with the military
departments to either work across combatant commands or cut across
operational domains. Further, the coordinating role played by the JAIC
could [make the cooperation [**more visible** and **easier** to assess
as a **blueprint**]{.mark} for other countries]{.underline}. On this
note, it could be seen as a pilot not just for U.S.-Singaporean
collaboration, but also as an inspiration for similar efforts with
partners in the Indo-Pacific region, which are under-represented in the
toolbox here.

With the U.K., the Bilateral Academic Research Initiative (BARI),
launched in 2018, focuses on creating academic collaborations. More
specifically, this collaboration could take the form of grants and
fellowships on AI research. With the inaugural pilot program selected to
focus on human-machine teaming, DOD and the U.K. Ministry of Defence
will respectively sponsor up to \$3 million and £1.5 million for the
multidisciplinary, academic team to conduct the "high-risk basic
research as a bilateral academic collaboration."59 Notably, while the
allies with the same level of intelligence access as the U.K. are
numbered, the broader academic and scientific focus of the BARI pilot
could be replicable for basic and applied research with many more
countries willing and able to co-fund these ventures.

[[The **flexibility** of these forms]{.mark} of collaboration
[is]{.mark} overall [a **strength**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That said, for
both examples here, the military AI collaboration projects fit into
existing, overarching frameworks of cooperation, as declared by the
heads of state or defense minister counterparts.60 Without these broader
frameworks, similar working-level relationships may be seen as ad hoc.

Cooperative S&T Blueprints

Whereas the above bilateral cooperation agreements are already oriented
toward AI, [the defense technology cooperation tools discussed below
could be integrated into the toolbox for AI, but have not yet done
so]{.underline}.

One example of such S&T blueprints is the Allied Prototyping Initiative.
Launched in 2019 by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering (OUSD/R&E), the Initiative funds a small number
of cooperative operational prototypes related to the top DOD
modernization priorities. Under the Initiative, the United States can
identify transition pathways for operational capabilities in the five-
to seven-year horizon, including future codevelopment with the U.S.
national security innovation ecosystem.61 So far, the program has funded
prototypes for highspeed propulsion technologies with Norway and
hypersonic vehicles with Australia.62 But given its focus on DOD
technology modernization priorities, the Initiative can also oversee
prototyping related to AI and machine learning, autonomy,
microelectronics, and fully networked command, control, and
communications.63

[Building on existing international cooperation agreements such as IT&E
agreements, future Allied Prototyping Initiative project arrangements
can help further identify the extent of TEVV and technology transition
funding focused on AI-enabled and autonomous systems. In fact, it may be
**[better suited]{.mark}** for this task than the longer-standing,
counterpart program]{.underline}, Foreign Comparative Testing.

Another small, regional agreement that can serve as a blueprint for AI
cooperation is the Polar Research, Development, Testing, and Evaluation
arrangement between the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, New
Zealand, Norway, and Sweden.64 Just as this agreement is based on a
"shared desire for strong cooperative relationships that preserve safe,
stable and secure Polar regions," [other **[minilat]{.mark}eral**
[arrangements]{.mark}]{.underline}---such as the Quad---[[could]{.mark}
use this as a **blueprint** to [align **R&D** and **TEVV**
priorities]{.mark}]{.underline} with a free, open, secure, and
prosperous Indo-Pacific.65

### Solvency -- Cybersecurity

Ankersen, Cambridge University Press, April 2022, ISBN:9781108954341
/GoGreen!

Building on previous chapters that treat the concept of cyber peace in
depth, the following definition focuses on four specific elements:

> [Cyber peace is]{.underline} \[...\] [not]{.underline} \[...\] [the
> absence of conflict]{.underline} \[...\]. [Rather it is the
> construction of a network of multilevel regimes that promote global,
> just and sustainable cybersecurity by clarifying the rules of the
> road]{.underline} for companies and countries alike to help reduce the
> threats of cyber conflict, crime and espionage to levels comparable to
> other business and national security risks. To achieve this goal, a
> new approach to cybersecurity is needed that seeks out best practices
> from the public and private sectors to build robust, secure systems
> and couches cybersecurity within the larger debate on internet
> governance.
>
> (Shackelford, 2014, pp. xxv--xxvi)

The four elements emphasized in the above definition describe the
fundamental connection between the goals of cyber peace and information
sharing (IS), the subject of this chapter (Johnson et al., 2016, p.
iii).Footnote1 Clarification of "rules of the road," whether these are
binding or voluntary; threat reduction, risk assessment, and best
practices for carrying out these three tasks are precisely the
substantive contribution that IS makes to the cybersecurity postures and
strategies of stakeholders participating in any given IS platform. As
detailed herein, such a platform optimally defines threshold norms of
permissible and nonpermissible online behavior on the part of all
actors, establishing the criteria for determining whether an individual,
private organization, country, group of hackers, or even another
autonomously acting computer has violated a rule (Deljoo et al., 2018,
p. 1508). It also reduces vulnerability to cyber threats by lessening
the informational asymmetries that characterize hostile cyber activities
to the advantage of the attacker, and contributes to organizational risk
assessment by integrating the information shared by other participants
in the IS community into heightened "cyber situational awareness" for
all sharers. Fourth, [IS is readily framed and understood by a
multiplicity of actors at the domestic level]{.underline} -- private,
governmental, and individual -- [as a best practice and, at the
international level, as a confidence-building measure (CBM) for building
trust among state and nonstate actors]{.underline}.Footnote2 These two
characterizations of IS in the domestic and international jurisdictional
arenas, respectively, are [[evidenced by]{.mark} the inclusion of IS
modalities in [many]{.mark} instances of]{.underline} national law and
policy, as well as tens of multilateral and [[**bilateral** instruments
for **governing cyberspace**]{.mark} at the international
level]{.underline} (Housen-Couriel, 2017, pp. 46--84). Five examples of
the latter are the 2015 Shanghai Cooperation Organization's
International Code of Conduct for Information Security, the UN GGE
Report of July 2015, the OSCE's Confidence-Building Measures for
Cyberspace of 2016, the EU's Network and Information Security Directive
that entered into force in August 2016; and the 2018 Paris Call for
Trust and Security in Cyberspace.

[When IS implemented as a voluntary or recommended best practice or CBM
in the context of these regulatory arrangements -- rather than as a
mandated regulatory requirement -- it has the **advantage** of
**bypassing** the legal challenges of achieving **formal** and
substantive **multistakeholder agreement** on **cyber
norms**]{.underline}. [The **difficulties** of such normative barriers
are **often observed** as characteristic of the contemporary cyber lay
of the land]{.underline}. [Either as a best practice (at the domestic
level) or a CBM at the international level, IS [has the **advantage** of
**bypassing** the **present challenges** of achieving **formal**]{.mark}
and substantive [**multistakeholder agreement** on **cyber norms** that
are **inherent elements** of]{.mark} national and
**[multilateral]{.mark}** legal [regimes for]{.mark} the **[governance
of cyberspace]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Macak, 2016; Ruhl et al., 2020).

We propose in this chapter that, [[as]{.mark} IS [platforms
provide]{.mark} increasingly relevant, timely, and actionable **[data on
vulnerabilities]{.mark}**, including **zero-day**
vulnerabilities]{.underline} (Ablon & Bogart, 2017); [adversaries'
tactics, techniques, and procedures; **malware** tool configurations;
and other tactical and strategic **threat indicators**, [stakeholders
will become **more incentivized** to **increasingly trust**]{.mark} IS
platforms [and]{.mark} to [utilize]{.mark} them [for]{.mark} both
**real-time [response]{.mark}** to hostile cyber activities [and]{.mark}
for building long-term **[cybersecurity
strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Technological advances are easing
this process, as platforms adopt new techniques for the automation of
alerts and communications among sharers (Wagner et al., 2019). Thus, in
instances when sharing communities are substantively and technologically
optimized for cybersecurity, participants benefit from expertise and
insights which may otherwise be unavailable to them with respect to
developing threat vectors, mitigation of specific cyber risks, and
real-time coordinated responses to hostile cyber events.

The Evolution of NATO Partnerships

After the Cold War, NATO's strategic focus shifted away from territorial
defense toward external crisis management and out-of-area operations.
This first played out in the Balkans and later in the Middle East and
North Africa. Meanwhile, NATO enlarged as countries in Eastern Europe
joined the alliance while others joined partnership frameworks. These
partnerships played an important role in NATO's mission to buttress
democracy and security in Europe in the 1990s. They also advanced its
mission to project stability in the Middle East and Africa.

[[Today, **NATO** boasts a **robust menu** of]{.mark} partnership
formats and [mechanisms]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Some---including]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Partnership for
Peace]{.underline}]{.mark}** Programme (PfP)1 [[and
the]{.underline}]{.mark} corresponding European-Atlantic Partnership
Council (EAPC), as well as the **[[Mediterranean
Dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark}**2 --- [[date]{.mark} back [to the]{.mark}
19**[90s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Others, like the **Istanbul
Cooperation Initiative**]{.underline},3 [were shaped by NATO's growing
focus on [issues like **counterterrorism** in]{.mark} the
20**00s**]{.underline}. [The involvement of a broad set of countries in
the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (**ISAF**) mission
in [**Afghanistan** gave rise to a new category]{.mark} of partners
labeled Partners across the Globe]{.underline}, which were emphasized by
the Strategic Concept adopted at the Lisbon Summit in 2010.4

[[While]{.mark} the EAPC (a forum for PfP countries), the Mediterranean
Dialogue, and the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative were **[envisioned as
multilat]{.mark}eral formats**, the [tools]{.mark} developed in the PfP
itself **[prioritize bilat]{.mark}eral [coop]{.mark}eration** and are
open to all NATO partners]{.underline}.5 In 2014, NATO launched the
Partnership Interoperability Initiative to improve the quality of
partners' contributions to NATO-led operations, missions, and exercises.
Within this framework, the Enhanced Opportunities Partnerships program
offers additional pathways for cooperation to six countries: Australia,
Finland, Georgia, Jordan, Sweden, and Ukraine. Georgia, Ukraine, and
Russia also all have separate and additional frameworks for dialogue and
cooperation through the NATO-Georgia Commission, the NATO-Ukraine
Commission, and the NATO-Russia Council.

[NATO's latest partnership effort has been dubbed One Partner, One
Plan]{.underline}. Although it is still in development, its aim would be
[to streamline activities with respective partner
countries]{.underline}. As this initiative evolves, it remains to be
seen how it will impact other partnership mechanisms or partnerships
more broadly. There are concerns it could [[lead to **further
bilateralization**]{.mark} of partnerships as well as one-size-fits all
approaches that provide less flexibility for the partner
country]{.underline}.

Despite this impressive list, NATO's partnership mechanisms are not
currently achieving their full potential and are due for a rethink. Many
major issues are being neglected. This is not to say that partners no
longer play a role in NATO's operations and priorities. On the contrary,
some---such as [**Sweden** and **Finland**--- are about as closely
integrated in NATO's planning as they could possibly be short of
membership. But, [as is also true with **Georgia** and **Ukraine**,
**most**]{.mark} of these [activities take place in
**bilat**]{.mark}**eral** or trilateral [formats]{.mark}]{.underline},
although these countries are also part of other, larger partnership
frameworks.

This reality reveals some flaws in NATO's partnership policy. [There are
not only **redundancies**, but many of the **broader frameworks have
lost momentum and purpose**]{.underline}. Many formats lack clear
processes and goals, lumping together diverse groups of nations that
have very different hopes and expectations in how they engage with NATO.
In addition, formats like the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul
Cooperation Initiative, which aim to catalyze broader cooperation beyond
the traditional Euro-Atlantic area, continue to fall short of their
intended purpose and lack a clear agenda for the future. While these
frameworks demonstrate their usefulness by building political ties and
space for dialogue, they are less effective when it comes to driving
actual outcomes that benefit NATO's interests or strategy, or those of
its partner countries.

[NATO tends to create new formats as the security environment changes
without first conducting a serious stocktaking and reformation of
existing partnerships mechanisms---a process that has
traditionally]{.underline} **\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]** [been extremely
partner driven]{.underline}. This "principle of new challenge -- new
format"6 [creates a buildup of barely used, somewhat irrelevant, or
effectively defunct mechanisms]{.underline}. On paper, there seems to be
broad partnership engagement, but in practice little is produced. This
puts into question the utility and purpose of NATO partnerships for all
parties concerned.

The [**hodge-podge** of partnership formats suggests]{.underline} a
serious need for greater strategic and institutional drive on the part
of NATO. [The ISAF mission in Afghanistan was a slight turning point in
this regard]{.underline}. Here, NATO played a crucial role in driving
the integration of partners---giving rise to a more strategic and
reciprocal approach to partnerships, with NATO not only assessing what
it "can do for its partners," but "what partners can do for \[NATO\]."7
Despite this shift, most partnerships going beyond specific missions are
still very much driven by partner initiative and shaped by partner
interests. This creates inefficiencies and fails to maximize partners'
contributions, which could be a huge asset to NATO in the face of
several emerging global challenges.

Minilateral Approaches to Security

[While NATO navigated the "new challenge -- new format" issue,
**minilateral** arrangements **thrived** in the Euro-Atlantic space,
[**proliferating** in]{.mark} the aftermath of defining security events,
from the end of the Cold War to 9/11. They have gained new prominence
throughout [the last decade]{.mark}]{.underline} as NATO finds itself
torn between competing priorities and struggles to balance territorial
defense and external stabilization efforts. [**[Differences in threat
perceptions]{.mark}** among members in Eastern and Southern Europe have
[added to this trend, as have **internal political tensions** and a
**growing desire for greater**]{.mark} **strategic [autonomy]{.mark}**
among some European countries]{.underline}.

NATO's eastern flank has been a particularly fertile landscape for
minilateral formats. Events, from the 2007 cyberattack on Estonia to the
2008 Russo-Georgian war to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and annexation
of Crimea, created a new impetus to enhance deterrence, readiness, and
exchange within and outside of NATO.

[Newer regional initiatives built on longstanding cooperative efforts,
[such as the]{.mark} Nordic **[Baltic 8]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a
regional format for political consultations formally established in 2000
[that engages Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania,
Norway, and Sweden]{.underline}.

In 2009, [the **[Nor]{.mark}**dic **[Def]{.mark}**ense
**[Co]{.mark}**operation was launched as a collaborative and voluntary
effort between Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and
Sweden]{.underline} to strengthen these countries' defense capabilities
and strategic regional exchange. [The **[Northern Group]{.mark}**, which
was established in 2010 by the United Kingdom as a forum to discuss
common defense and security issues, has a wider geographical
reach]{.underline}.8

[The **[Bucharest 9]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in contrast, [is a
minilateral format that includes all allies on NATO's Eastern Flank---
from Estonia in the North to Bulgaria in the South]{.underline}.
Although it is independent of NATO, it is closely aligned with the
alliance, with representatives meeting on the sidelines of NATO
summits.9

Recent years have also seen a rise in broader ad hoc groupings among
European nations that create capacity to respond to crises. In this
regard, [the French-driven European Intervention Initiative
(**[EI2]{.mark}**)]{.underline}10 received significant attention. It is
a lean, relatively informal structure that aims to drive a common
strategic culture among participating European nations. It is
deliberately independent of NATO and the EU to create a high degree of
flexibility. [Besides France, EU member states Belgium, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain,
Sweden, and Italy, are part of the initiative, as well as non-EU
countries, Norway and the United Kingdom]{.underline}.

The EI2's primary focus is exchange, collaboration, and planning to
better position participating nations to act quickly in a crisis.
Underscoring its agility, a joint statement by EI2 Defense Ministers
published at their second ministerial meeting in 2019 describes the
initiative as "a flexible, resource-neutral and non-binding forum, where
all the Participants are equal."11 And while members are not bound to
participate in any operations, the format is designed to help prepare
them to work together in potential future missions as part of NATO, the
EU, UN, or other ad hoc groupings.

Part of the rationale for the EI2 initiative was the French Defense
Ministry's exasperation with time consuming and excessive consultations
between NATO members in crisis situations---a conclusion colored by
experiences including the 2013 intervention in Mali and the 2015 Paris
terrorist attacks.12 The EI2 is designed to speed up this process by
establishing a shared strategic culture that will make it possible to
respond to crises more quickly. It enables European nations to set up
groupings that can act swiftly and step in to act independently of
larger institutions or lay the groundwork for larger operation overseen
by the UN, NATO or the EU.

The EI2 [[underscores **frustration with NATO's consensus
structure**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the multi-body governance process
of the EU. Both institutions are not known for quick decision making. As
such, the EI2 could be an enabling asset in a crisis, but it also calls
into question some of the core tasks assigned to NATO. Specifically,
there are certain redundancies with other efforts, including some
endorsed by NATO like the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force (see further
below). Moreover, it remains to be seen if significant divergences
between the EI2 members in terms of strategic cultures -- including
their willingness to engage in conflict13 -- can really produce any
successes absent the larger institutional momentum provided by an
organization like NATO or the EU once they achieve consensus.

The EI2 was launched in the wake of French disappointments with the
Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), which was established in 2017
to jointly develop defense capabilities within the EU. Although PESCO is
part of the EU's Common Security and Defense Policy, participation is
voluntary and is open to those "capable and willing."14 The degree of
integration became a sticking point for this format. For instance,
France envisioned a selective initiative with more capable EU member
states, leading to a leaner structure and a greater level of ambition.15
Ultimately, Germany's vision of a more inclusive model prevailed with
all but two EU member states (Denmark and Malta) joining PESCO. In
contrast, the EI2's "small, but mighty" scope is more in line with
President Emmanuel Macron's vision of European leadership.

height="3.469507874015748in"}

Although PESCO is an initiative driven by EU members and so far no third
states have joined, it is a format embedded within the EU that allows
third states to participate if they are invited by the participating
members. Progress has been less ambitious than originally envisioned in
this treaty-based format, in part due to a lack of sufficient funding.

Surveying the evolution of NATO partnerships reveals several important
takeaways. First, [[the era of doing **big things**]{.mark} with several
partners across the alliance [has]{.mark} largely **[come to a
halt]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at least for the time being. Absent a
significant investment of energy to revive efforts like the
European-Atlantic Partnership Council (which [[faces]{.mark} nearly
[**intractable political hurdles** and has **not produced anything of
substance**]{.mark}]{.underline} since its policy for the implementation
of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security in
2014)28 or to consider new ways to engage a broad range of partners,
[[it is **hard to see how this dynamic will
change**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [NATO's increasing tendency to engage
with a more limited set of partners confirms that [**broader
frameworks** are **no longer the preferred
approach**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If successfully implemented, [**[NATO's
plans]{.mark}** to streamline its partnership agenda under "One Partner,
One Plan" may **[continue the trend of bilateralizing]{.mark}**
relationships with partner countries]{.underline} without facilitating
broader networks of partner engagement.

[Even NATO's more recent mission-driven partnership
efforts]{.underline}, like the Enhanced Opportunities Partnerships
program (EOP), [are running out of steam as members and partners
consider winding down the Resolute Support Mission in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. The EOP has successfully deepened integration
and interoperability of its six partners with NATO forces. But
[[**post-Afghanistan**, it will be **little more than a conglomeration
of heterogenous partners**]{.mark} that are more interoperable with NATO
but are clearly guided by varying motivations]{.underline}. Georgia and
Ukraine hope to ultimately join the alliance. Finland and Sweden want to
be more interoperable to contribute to NATO efforts in line with their
own defense and security concerns. For Australia and Jordan, it is about
connecting to an institution that gives the opportunity for cooperation
with a broad spectrum of nations in the Euro-Atlantic space. In the
near-term, NATO is unlikely to undertake new out-of-area missions,
particularly with increased reluctance of the United States to engage
militarily. Translating the EOP into a broader flexible engagement is
extremely unlikely given the varying political calculations of its
participants. [As a result, it is difficult to see how its successes can
be carried forward, again reinforcing the need to think in new terms
about the contours of NATO partnerships]{.underline}.

From the Barents and the Baltic Sea in the north, through Central Europe
and the Balkans, to the Black Sea in the south [a range of new
**[subregional]{.mark}** groups and **[coop]{.mark}eration processes**
have emerged in Europe]{.underline} during the 1990s. [[Compared to
**NATO**]{.underline}]{.mark} and the European Union, [these new
subregional groups have received little attention. Their \'indirect
approach\' to security, however, plays an important role in overcoming
the legacy of the Cold War, **[reducing]{.mark} the [risks of military
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} and addressing nonmilitary security
challenges. [As **NATO**]{.underline} and the EU [expand eastwards,
**subregionalism** is assuming growing importance as a means of
**avoiding new \'dividing lines\' in Europe**]{.underline}. After the
wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, subregionalism is also gaining importance as
a means of building cooperation in South-Eastern Europe. The challenge
for the future is to give more substance and depth to Europe\'s new
subregional cooperation frameworks.

Stretching from the Barents and the Baltic Sea in the north, through
Central Europe and the Balkans, to the Black Sea in the south a range of
new subregional groups and cooperation processes have emerged in Europe
since the end of the Cold War.1

In Northern Europe these subregional cooperation initiatives now include
the Council of Baltic Sea States (CBSS), a new security dimension to
cooperation among the five Nordic states, cooperation among the three
Baltic states, \'five-plus-three\' cooperation between the Nordic and
Baltic states and the far northern Barents Euro-Arctic Council (BEAC).2

In Central Europe they include the Visegrad group, the Central European
Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and the Central European Initiative (CEI).
In South-Eastern Europe there is the Black Sea Economic Cooperation
(BSEC) and, since the 1995 Dayton peace agreement for Bosnia, the Balkan
Conference initiated by the countries of the subregion, the EU\'s
Royaumont Process and the United States-led Southeast European
Cooperative Initiative (SECI). In the wake of the 1999 war in Kosovo,
the international community has also established a new Stability Pact
for South-Eastern Europe to promote cooperation in the Balkans.
Europe\'s new subregional groups now span the whole of the region that
was the heart of the Cold War East-West division of the continent.

[**Despite** their relatively **low profile** compared to]{.underline}
Europe\'s larger security organisations, particularly
**[NATO]{.underline}** and the European Union (EU), [these new
**subregional cooperation** groups are [making a **significant and
growing contribution** to]{.mark} European
[security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By bringing together Western and
Eastern European states the new subregional groups are helping to
**erase the Cold War division** of the continent and establish **new
patterns of cooperation**]{.underline}.

Subregional groups also provide important frameworks for addressing the
growing agenda of \'soft\' security challenges in areas such as
democratisation, human and minority rights, economics, the environment
and transnational crime. Indeed, these groups follow what may be
described as the \'indirect approach\' to security: they do not deal
with traditional security issues (the balance of power, alliances,
military power) or the direct sources of conflicts, but rather
facilitate high level political contacts, lower level
\'people-to-people\' ties and cooperation in addressing non- or \'soft\'
security issues - with the implicit objective of building confidence
between states and societies and providing a basis for longer term
peaceful relations.3

In the context of NATO\'s and the EU\'s enlargement into Central and
Eastern Europe and after the conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo, there is
growing interest in subregional cooperation. Subregional frameworks such
as the Visegrad group, CEFTA, the CBSS and the new Stability Pact for
South-Eastern Europe are viewed as means of facilitating Central and
Eastern European states\' integration with NATO and the EU by
establishing patterns of cooperation with NATO/EU and helping states to
adopt the NATO/EU \'acquis\' of political, economic and military
standards.

Perhaps [even more importantly, **subregional** groups also [provide
**important** means of **avoiding a new division of Europe** as a result
of the **eastward enlargement of NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the EU.
[By bringing together longstanding NATO]{.underline}/EU [members,
\'first wave\' new members, other Central and Eastern European states
who will have to wait some time before they join NATO]{.underline} or
the EU [and those states outside the enlargement process and wary of its
consequences ([particularly **Russia**]{.mark} and Ukraine),
**subregional** groups provide frameworks for sustaining and
**[deepening coop]{.mark}eration [across]{.mark}** the potential
**[dividing lines]{.mark}** of the new Europe]{.underline}.

After the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, further, subregionalism is assuming
growing importance as a means of promoting democratisation, economic
reconstruction, conflict resolution and cooperation among the countries
of South-Eastern Europe. As a result of these developments, Western
governments are giving increasing support to subregional cooperation and
NATO and the EU are developing new subregional dimensions to their
eastern outreach policies.

As Europe faces the challenge of NATO and EU enlargement and continuing
instability in the Balkans, subregionalism has a potentially important
role to play in sustaining cooperation on NATO/EU\'s eastern borders,
promoting democracy and economic reform, addressing new \'soft\'
security challenges and preventing future conflicts. [The challenge for
the future will be to give **more substance and depth** to the existing
subregional frameworks, making **subregional cooperation** a **central
part** of Europe\'s new order **alongside NATO**]{.underline} and the
EU.

Established during the Cold War, [[**NATO** is]{.mark} a transatlantic
security alliance [**composed of** thirty **member
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the United States.

NATO has focused on deterring Russian aggression in recent years, but it
has also conducted security operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo, and
Somalia.

Amid Russia's 2022 offensive in Ukraine, many NATO allies are providing
Kyiv with extraordinary quantities of military supplies, and the
alliance could expand to include Finland and Sweden.

Introduction

Founded in 1949 as a bulwark against Soviet aggression, [the **North
Atlantic Treaty Organization** (NATO)]{.underline} remains the pillar of
U.S.-Europe military cooperation. An expanding bloc of NATO allies has
taken on a broad range of missions since the close of the Cold War, many
well beyond the Euro-Atlantic region, in countries such as Afghanistan
and Libya.

Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, a nonmember, in early 2022 has
shaken Europe's security architecture and prompted a major reevaluation
of NATO members' foreign policies and defense commitments. The threat
from Russia has generated the greatest tensions with the alliance in the
post-Cold War era. It is driving up defense spending and pushing some
longtime NATO partners, namely Finland and Sweden, to seek formal
membership, which would mark another historic expansion of the alliance.

A Post--Cold War Pivot

After the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Western leaders intensely
debated the direction of the transatlantic alliance. Some in the Bill
Clinton administration initially opposed expanding NATO, wary it would
upset relations with President Boris Yeltsin's fragile government in
Russia and complicate other U.S. foreign policy objectives, such as
nuclear arms control. Others favored expansion as a way to extend NATO's
security umbrella to the east and consolidate democratic gains in the
former Soviet bloc.

European members were also split on the issue. The United Kingdom feared
NATO's expansion would dilute the alliance, while France believed it
would give NATO (and the United States) too much influence. Paris hoped
to integrate former Soviet states via European institutions.

As a first step, Clinton chose to develop a new NATO initiative called
the Partnership for Peace (PfP), which would be open to all former
Warsaw Pact members, as well as non-European countries. Seeing this
nonmembership framework as a means to allay some of Russia's concerns
about alliance expansion, NATO launched PfP at its annual summit in
1994. More than two dozen countries, including Georgia, Russia, and
Ukraine, joined in the following months.

However, Clinton soon began speaking publicly \[PDF\] about expanding
NATO's membership, saying in the Czech Republic just days after the
launch of PfP that "the question is no longer whether NATO will take on
new members but when and how." Yeltsin warned Western leaders at a
conference later that year that "Europe, even before it has managed to
shrug off the legacy of the Cold War, is risking encumbering itself with
a cold peace."

Beyond Collective Defense

Many U.S. officials felt that a post--Cold War vision for NATO needed to
look beyond its core defense commitments---Article V of the North
Atlantic Treaty states that "an armed attack against one or more
\[member states\] in Europe or North America shall be considered an
attack against them all"---and focus on confronting challenges outside
its membership. "The common denominator of all the new security problems
in Europe is that they all lie beyond NATO's current borders," said
influential U.S. Senator Richard Lugar in a 1993 speech.

The breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s and the onset of ethnic
conflict tested the alliance on this point almost immediately. What
began as a mission to impose a UN-sanctioned no-fly zone over Bosnia and
Herzegovina evolved into a bombing campaign on Bosnian Serb forces that
many military analysts say was essential to ending the conflict. In
April 1994, during Operation Deny Flight, NATO conducted its first
combat operations in its forty-year history, shooting down four Bosnian
Serb aircraft.

**[NATO\'s Structure]{.underline}**

Headquartered in Brussels, [NATO is [a consensus-based alliance]{.mark}
in which decisions must be unanimous. [**However**, **individual
states** or **subgroups**]{.mark} of allies **[can initiate
action]{.mark}** outside NATO's auspices]{.underline}. For instance, the
United States, France, and the United Kingdom began policing a
UN-sanctioned no-fly zone in Libya in early 2011 and, within days,
transferred command of the operation to NATO once Turkey's concerns had
been allayed. [Member states are not required to participate in every
NATO operation]{.underline}; Germany and Poland declined to contribute
directly to the campaign in Libya.

NATO's military structure comprises two strategic commands: the Supreme
Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, located near Mons, Belgium, and the
Allied Command Transformation, located in Norfolk, Virginia. The supreme
allied commander Europe oversees all NATO military operations and is
always a U.S. flag or general officer; U.S. Air Force General Tod D.
Wolters currently holds this position. Although the alliance has an
integrated command, most forces remain under their respective national
authorities until NATO operations commence.

NATO's secretary-general, Norwegian politician Jens Stoltenberg, is
serving a second four-year term as the bloc's chief administrator and
international envoy. However, NATO leaders extended his service for one
additional year (until September 2023) amid the war in Ukraine.
[[The]{.mark} alliance's principal [**political body** is the **North
Atlantic Council**]{.mark}, which is composed of high-level delegates
from each member state]{.underline}.

Human rights violations as outlined in broad terms in the 2011 World
Report, and pressure from organizations such as Human Rights Watch most
certainly add to the international pressure on NATO to intervene. This
has led to the discovery that military power may not be a useful
instrument in dealing with specific country by country issues in the
region. [[**NATO** is a **group** of]{.mark} democratic [**countries**
who]{.mark} in turn [**each** have an **individual**
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline} when dealing in the Middle East and North
Africa, and are tied to the region by their oil dependency; but
protection of human rights as justification for military intervention
must be across the board or not at all. Military intervention in Libya
was completed swiftly based largely on the economic incentives of NATO's
democratic powers, whereas in Syria, NATO has been immobilized as more
people die everyday.

WHAT IS NATO?

[[**NATO** is a **group** of]{.mark} 30 [**member countries** that agree
to]{.mark} work together]{.underline} to ensure the security of the
Northern Atlantic area.

"NATO's purpose is to guarantee the freedom and security of its members
through political and military means," according to its website.
Politically, the alliance promotes democracy, and it allows its members
to ["consult and [cooperate on]{.mark}]{.underline} defence and
[[security]{.mark}-related issues]{.underline} to solve problems, build
trust and, in the long run, prevent conflict."

\--MDC = multinational defense cooperation

**Németh 14** Bence Németh, Teaching fellow in the Defence Studies
Department, King\'s College London, "Why won\'t Europeans use NATO and
the EU?" Friends of Europe, 3-19-2014,

/GoGreen!

[Although regional MDCs have been proliferating]{.underline} and
strengthening in Europe, [they remain **fragile**]{.underline} and this
fragility will have a significant impact on the landscape of European
defence. The weakness of regional MDCs is that they are driven mostly by
national Ministries of Defence and do not have a well-grounded,
strategically sophisticated background for collaboration. Countries
often co-operate on defence issues without defining their common foreign
policy goals. T[his can undermine the raison d'être of defence
cooperation, even in the short-term, and cause significant problems in
situations where participating states of regional MDCs are divided on
the necessity of military action]{.underline}.

[Another difficulty for **[sub-regional]{.mark} MDCs** is
that]{.underline} although they face financial pressure to find
multinational partners to mitigate the capability decline of European
armed forces, [they **cannot develop these collaborations without
significant political and social support**. These problems of regional
MDCs may [have a **negative impact** on **defence
co-op**]{.mark}**eration [in NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU as
well, [because Ministries of Defence will be [**even less inclined** to
work together in **large organisations** **if** they **cannot**]{.mark}
**even succeed** [in **smaller**]{.mark} frameworks]{.underline}.
[[**However**, **if**]{.mark} these [difficulties can be
**overcome**]{.mark} by certain regional MDCs, the participating states
will have to bring their foreign policy goals closer to underpin their
co-operation. Accordingly, **[emerging]{.mark} regional [blocs]{.mark}**
may [become **more assertive**]{.mark} in achieving their goals,
[and]{.mark} thus **regional solidarity** [could **replace
transatlantic** or **pan-European solidarity** in **more and more**
cases]{.mark}. This may **[undermine]{.mark}** the relevance of
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU, [and result in a **much
weaker** EU]{.underline}.

[To avoid these outcomes, **NATO**]{.underline} and the EU [have to pay
more attention to the regional MDCs and must attempt to **channel the
results of regional MDCs into their processes as much as
possible**]{.underline}. [NATO has a **comparative advantage** in this
regard, as it possesses a much **more sophisticated and effective
defence planning system** (NATO Defence Planning Process --
NDPP)]{.underline} than the EU. [The NDPP is not perfect, but it
provides a **flexible enough instrument** to tackle multinational
military collaborations as it has **already done** with multinational
projects in the framework of the Smart Defence initiative]{.underline}.

[[**NATO** should]{.mark} therefore, via its NDPP, **support and
[embed]{.mark}** [the projects of **regional MDCs** **into its own
processes** and **ensure**]{.mark} that **[MDCs work to fulfil NATO
commitments]{.mark}** and contribute to the Level of Ambition of the
Alliance. [This]{.mark} way NATO could **[mitigate]{.mark}** the chance
of the [development of **regional interests**]{.mark} in Europe
[and]{.mark} at the same time [provide **political impetus** for
**regional MDCs** to **overcome**]{.mark} **the [hardships]{.mark}** of
day-to-day practical collaboration]{.underline}.

[For the last several years **NATO**]{.underline} and the EU have [tried
to **push** together countries 'artificially' to **make them
co-operate** on certain capability areas]{.underline}. [Yet, European
nations created and reenergised regional MDCs. Thus, **NATO
should**]{.underline} look to its other options and [rather **follow**
the **'organic' evolution** of European military collaborations and
**channel that into its defence planning process**]{.underline}.

/GoGreen!

**[Instead of using NATO]{.underline}** and EU institutional frameworks,
[European nations have recently established a series of new regional
'multinational defence co-operations' (**MDCs**) and reenergised old
ones]{.underline}. Although policymakers and analysts support all kinds
of defence co-operation, they have not taken into consideration the
negative consequences of unstructured defence collaborations. For
instance, [**[if]{.mark}** the emerging regional [MDCs do **not prove
successful**, they **will hinder defence co-op**]{.mark}**eration** in
Europe [**in general**, including]{.mark} within
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU, [as nations [become **even
less willing** to work with **larger organisations**]{.mark} where
co-operation is **slower** and **more complicated**]{.underline}.

[[**However**, **if**]{.mark} these **[MDCs succeed]{.mark}**, they are
[likely to]{.mark} create common views and interests among regional
partners on defence issues, thereby strengthening regional bodies and
**[weaken]{.mark}ing [transatlantic ties]{.mark}** [and **pan-European
solidarity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, NATO and the EU should revise
their policies which attempt to foster defence co-operation based
exclusively on common military capability requirements, and should
instead focus on exploiting the changing European defence co-operation
landscape by channelling regional MDCs into their planning systems.

How to "read" the Russian reference to the missile shield

Of course, in what Moscow proposes here, Romania is included -- we can
read the anti-missile shield between the lines quite obviously. And not
because the Americans would like to withdraw it -- it is an
American-Romanian project, but it has been assimilated and legitimized
by NATO decisions. Let it be clear, it is a NATO project, it is not a
bilateral agreement, as I heard from a party in Romania, that we kissed
the ring of the Americans in 2013 (allusion to Călin Georgescu, honorary
president of AUR -- no. ).

Here the issue is very clear: Vladimir Putin does not want to discuss
arms control with the Americans, but political issues. [[Political
issues]{.mark}, Americans say, [are discussed in **NATO, not
bilaterally**]{.mark}. [Because **if**]{.mark} it is discussed

among them is its heavy dependence on the European market. He cites the

Europe provides Russia with roughly two-thirds of its government
revenue.

Despite this impressive list, NATO's partnership mechanisms are not
currently achieving their full potential and are due for a rethink. Many
major issues are being neglected. This is not to say that partners no
longer play a role in NATO's operations and priorities. On the contrary,
some---such as Sweden and Finland--- are about as closely integrated in
NATO's planning as they could possibly be short of membership. But, as
is also true with Georgia and Ukraine, [most of these activities take
place in **[bilateral]{.mark}** or trilateral formats]{.underline},
although these countries are also part of other, larger partnership
frameworks.

[This [reality reveals]{.mark} some **[flaws]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
NATO's partnership policy. [There are not only **redundancies**, but
many of the broader frameworks have lost momentum and
purpose]{.underline}. [Many formats lack clear processes and goals,

hopes and expectations in how they engage with NATO]{.underline}. In
addition, formats like the Mediterranean Dialogue and the Istanbul
Cooperation Initiative, which aim to catalyze broader cooperation beyond
the traditional Euro-Atlantic area, continue to fall short of their
intended purpose and lack a clear agenda for the future. [[While]{.mark}
these frameworks demonstrate their usefulness by [building]{.mark}
political ties and [**space for dialogue**, they are **less effective**

Are [Europe and America having [**doubts** about]{.mark} their
**[decades-long habits]{.mark}** of common defence]{.underline}?
[America\'s ambassador to NATO darkly describes the current
spat]{.underline} between NATO and the European Union (and for that
matter within the EU itself), over what military things Europeans might
plot to do together and where they might plot them, [as "[one of the
**greatest dangers to the transatlantic
relationship**]{.mark}"]{.underline}. France, Germany, Belgium and
Luxembourg, who started the quarrel by announcing that the EU should
build its own operational-planning headquarters in Tervuren, a
previously inoffensive suburb of Brussels, claim that causing a rift in
the alliance could not be further from their minds. But more is at stake
than bricks and mortar. [How the row is settled **[will affect the way
Europe and America can work together in the
future]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

They have supposedly already agreed on many of the basics: that
Europe\'s armies should boost their limited firepower, for example; and
that the EU should be able to act independently of NATO in cases where
the alliance, with right of first refusal, chooses not to be involved
itself. Indeed a painstakingly worked-out formula, finalised in March,
enables the EU to use NATO equipment for these sorts of military
operations, as is already happening in the Lilliputian mission the
Europeans have taken over from NATO in Macedonia. There is even general
agreement that the EU should be able to plan for its own military
operations.

The real disagreement is about how the Tervuren four want the EU to do
that---in its own headquarters, entirely separate from NATO. And the
Americans have been alarmed as much by the way the proposal came about
as by its content: the four, all sceptics of the Iraq war, cooked it up
at their own mini-summit in April, when tempers were still running high.
Disparaged at the time as a "chocolate soldier" summit, given the
limited military capabilities of its Belgian host, among others, the
meeting nevertheless made the Americans worry that Europe\'s defence
effort might start to evolve into a competitor to NATO, rather than as a
complement to it. All the more so, as it fits President Jacques
Chirac\'s recently expressed neo-Gaullist vision of a "multipolar"
world, one in which Europe could potentially be as much America\'s rival
as its ally.

Still more worrying, Britain\'s Tony Blair may have made concessions to
the neo-Gaullists at a get-together with Mr Chirac and Germany\'s
Gerhard Schröder last month. Perhaps to show goodwill in advance of the
wrangling over the draft European Union constitution, perhaps to seem to
distance himself a little from George Bush, Mr Blair was more hospitable
than Britain had previously seemed to the notion of independent
operational planning by the EU. He also appeared to agree that some EU
members should be allowed to push ahead on defence without the rest,
though he has been careful to insist that any advance party must be open
to others to join. He is clear, too, that Europe\'s defence efforts must
remain compatible with NATO\'s---and he has the support of a lot of
other European governments in that. He has therefore ruled out setting
up military shop in Tervuren. And he has so far shown no sign of giving
way to those who want the new EU constitution to contain a
mutual-defence clause, which could undermine NATO\'s status as the
ultimate guarantor of Europe\'s security.

Friendly fire

Mr Blair is right. The EU can already plan its own military operations,
whether using NATO kit (as in Macedonia), or that of France and Britain,
its two most militarily capable nations. The EU\'s mission in Congo, for
example, is being run from a French headquarters. Putting up a new
building for such purposes, at Tervuren or anywhere else, makes no
sense. If something more is needed, better---and safer---for the EU to
do its operational planning at NATO\'s existing military headquarters at
Mons, in Belgium. Both sets of planners will be calling on the same pool
of soldiers, making co-ordination essential. And it is more soldiers,
not more headquarters to order them about, that Europe needs. What is
more, if an EU operation should ever go wrong, and NATO is called in to
help, common procedures would put fewer soldiers\' lives at risk.

[The [Americans]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, are also at fault. The
Bush administration has itself [recently seemed intent on **[dividing
NATO]{.mark}** into allies and irritants. This [**gives the impression**
that it prefers]{.mark} strong Europeans to a strong Europe. It wants
well-armed [countries with whom it can **work bilaterally instead of

Even immediately following the attacks, when for the first time in its
history NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, its mutual
defense commitment, the United States preferred to deal with its allies
bilaterally rather than through the alliance. [[As regards the actual

Three other limitations or gaps have been raised in numerous discussions
with SC personnel in DoD. We indicated above that [**DoD** has been
**limited**]{.underline} in some authorities [to **working only with**
foreign forces associated with **national defense agencies**.
**[Emerging]{.mark}** transnational **[threats]{.mark} and mission
areas** **[require]{.mark}** the [ability to work with]{.mark} interior
agency forces or other gendarme or civil authorities when their security
forces retain primary responsibility for those mission areas or operate
in close collaboration with MoDs]{.underline}. For example, in many
cases, the ministry or department of interior is responsible for
securing national infrastructure and cyber assets; of six countries
CENTCOM officials are engaging on infrastructure security, only in
Jordan is the military responsible for protecting the country's
infrastructure.66

[A second gap in Title 10 authorities is in the flexibility for DoD to
work with [**regional organizations** rather than just
**bilaterally**]{.mark} with national governments. Under **Title 10**,
even regional programs]{.underline} (such as the Counterterrorism
Partnership Fund \[CTPF\]) [are implemented **bilaterally** with
national governments. There are **no mechanisms** for training and
equipping **regional organizations**]{.underline}.67 When this
limitation is combined with the limitation on U.S. military engagement
with non-MoD security forces, [it **[inhibits]{.mark}** the U.S.
**[ability to facilitate coordination]{.mark}** among agencies with
similar responsibilities [within and across partners]{.mark} to have
regional effects and [to address]{.mark} local [security
threats]{.mark}]{.underline}.68

Finally, while Section 1206 and the subsequent Section 2282 were
designed to be a more rapid means of building partner capacity than
traditional Title 22 authorities like FMF and FMS, even these programs
take some 12-18 months to deliver equipment to partners. A number of SC
stakeholders in DoD still perceive a need for more "timely assistance"
to partners who require small amounts of support to recover or enhance
existing capability of their "forces in the fight."69 Currently, these
stakeholders point out, a "pseudo-FMS" case for \$10,000 in truck
springs takes the same amount of time to process as a major item of
equipment.70

Summary of DoD Perceptions of Title 10 SC Authorities

In sum, DoD has been able to achieve many of its SC objectives with the
patchwork of Title 10 authorities, but the proliferation of authorities
and the complexities they engender have rendered them exceedingly
difficult to apply. As we have noted here and in previous research,
authorities are not the only reason for the frustration expressed by SC
personnel; internal processes, organizational relationships,
programmatic requirements, and inadequate levels of funding have also
created obstacles. But the existing catalog of Title 10 authorities in
some ways drives or complicates these other factors when they present
the challenges in planning and execution detailed above. [What
[many]{.mark} in the DoD SC community **[perceive]{.mark}** as [a
**flawed legislative foundation**]{.mark} [has]{.mark} had [a
**compounding impact** on]{.mark} the administration and [**management**
of **SC programs**]{.mark}, systems, and processes]{.underline}.

The development of this new European strategic approach reveals [a
**constant tension** between two political centres]{.underline}, within
which engagement in collaborative crisis management can happen. That of
Brussels, calling for [further security and defence
integration]{.underline}, while cooperating [with **NATO**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} that of capable and willing European [member states
interested in preserving their **sovereignty** and **strategic
autonomy**]{.underline}. [These developments towards what **sometimes
appears** to generate **conflicting** courses of action, has produced a
**layered system** where cooperation occurs in different configurations.
These configurations coexist and sometimes compete with formal
organizations such as]{.underline} the EU/CSDP and [NATO]{.underline}
and the cooperative framework that result from EU-NATO Joint
Declarations of 2016 and 2018. [This system of security governance is a
three-layered system where **multilateralism**, **minilateralism** and
strategic **bilateralism** **coexist**]{.underline}, allowing
participants to accommodate goals, benefits and security practices that
emanate at the EU and NATO level, with those driven by particular
national interests.

Each serves a different collaborative purpose. Multilateralism20 in the
framework of cooperative security arrangements comprehends a majority of
participants in a given security regime21 for instance that of the UN,
NATO or EU, leading to the development of formal and long-lasting
cooperation and coordination among states and organizations. Conversely,
minilateralism comprises a few like-minded and willing participants,
with similar national interests and approaches to foreign and security
policy, as well as identical operational output. Distinctive from
multilateralism and minilateralism, "strategic bilateralism" (Renard
2016, p. 14) involves particular forms of selective engagement of
strategically able and willing participants with self-interested motives
in converging security views and policies, whether those are defence and
security policies or security issue-based concerns such as terrorism,
cyber or hybrid threats.

Being beyond the scope of this paper, [these security configurations
offers analytical space to **empirical research** allowing to **test**
in which conditions, how this coexistence **strengthens** or conversely
**weakens** cooperative security and how it impacts on EuroAtlantic
security]{.underline}. The inclusion of [a **multilateralist focus** in
major political and strategic documents, such as the]{.underline} Treaty
of Lisbon, the European Security Strategy (Council of the European Union
2003), the EU Global Strategy (High Representative 2016) and
[**[NATO]{.mark}** Strategic Concept]{.underline} (North Atlantic
Council 2010) [[is]{.mark} accompanied by references to [a **normative**
and **ruled based multilateral stand**]{.mark}, on which]{.underline}
both the EU and [**NATO** are founded and [from which they **draw
legitimacy** for]{.mark} their external action in [**crisis management**
and **conflict resolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[This **constitutive base**]{.mark} for common security and collective
action has also been **[shap]{.mark}ing** the base for **[cooperative
output]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the two organizations, having the
EU's interpretation of multilateralism, a normative and regulative
emphasis that binds individual to common interests and obligations,
while promoting "issue-based engagements" (Council of the European Union
2019, § 8 and 9) preferred by Member States and partners. Since 2016, an
officially assumed interest-based approach to security and defence can
be identified in several EU documents, such as the EU Global Strategy,
the European Commission statements on the launch of the European Defence
Fund or in the process leading to the institutionalisation of a
Directorate General for Defence. Such initiatives may also translate
what seems to be a more strategic European approach to new concepts,
such as resilience or ownership22, while "principled pragmatism" appears
as the new guiding principle for common foreign, security and defence
policy, to use the expression adopted by the EU Global Strategy itself.

In the EU context, this emerging security governance discourse and
practice based on effective multilateralism seeks to help confirming the
Union as a security provider. [First, it **legitimises** and reiterates
the international stand]{.underline} of the European Union [through
**international law**, on the base of **values**, but also of
**interests** that constitute a given multilateral
structure]{.underline}. [Second, it **informs** a normative and
**regulative basis** for **internal and external relations** of Member
States by reducing the space between these two levels of
security]{.underline}. [Third, it sets a **comprehensive platform** of
cooperative engagement to **harmonize implementation** of guidelines, to
improve coordination and to enhance cooperation at different levels: the
international, the regional and the local]{.underline}. Fourth, in those
non-juridically binding policy domains or on those areas which fall
outside the aquis communautaire, it offers the opportunity for willing
compliance among Member States (Nunes 2018). Due to the EU institutional
design, with multi-level decision making levels, complex formal
decision-making structure and wide-ranging external relations,
[**multilateralism** offers a **broader** multi-layered and
**trans-sectoral scope** for policy action. It comprehends diverse
policy domains with security implications from crisis management to
humanitarian and development aid, adding to security new themes such as
**cyberspace** or climate change and making available different policy
instruments, whether one refers to those of trade, foreign policy,
security and more recently defence]{.underline}. The EU forms a regional
order, within which the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and
CSDP constitute a security regime shared by Member States, where the EU
leads various multilateral processes (Ujvari 2016, p. 2) from trade to
development. [In a European context, multilateralism also means a system
of governance within]{.underline} which traditional actors such as the
UN, **[NATO]{.underline}** and African Union coexist with emergent
actors like China or India or [with **decision-making
frameworks**]{.underline}23 [such as the **North Atlantic
Council**]{.underline}.

Multilateralism has been a cross cutting theme in the EU and NATO policy
documents.24 [Being **suggested by some as hindering** national
interest, it is acknowledged by others as a prevailing governance
system. This **[despite]{.mark}** a tendency for
**[bilateralization]{.mark}** of policies, manifestation of preference
for intergovernmental decision-making methods or **regionalization** of
security and defence through **minilateralism** of security and defence
initiatives]{.underline}, as explained further ahead. [Multilateral
platforms, such as **[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the EU, [[favour
**jointness of action** and **harmonization of understandings**]{.mark}
**on security**. **Despite** the presence of **other cooperative
configurations**, it is **[still a lasting method of
coop]{.mark}eration** in the euro-atlantic context for several
reasons]{.underline}. [First, it is likely to gain support for
**legitimacy** reasons adding normative guidance and
**representativeness** to security practice, due to the number of
participants involved, serving both common and particular
interests]{.underline}. In June 2019, the European Council Conclusions
describes it as ["the **best way** to advance national, as well as
collective interests"]{.underline} (Council of the European Union 2019,
§ 2). [Second, for reasons of **self-regulation** of security and
defence relations among participants, predisposing them to
self-restrain, as opposed to "more common unilateral and less restrained
methods"]{.underline} (Jervis 1985, p. 59). [Third, for **facilitating
ad hoc access to resources** and security and defence goods, such as
common or collective knowledge, expertise and capabilities]{.underline}.

The minilateralist configuration of security and defence cooperation is
characterised by cooperative arrangements among like-minded countries,
for instance in the EU case under the form of "Pooling & Sharing"
initiatives or "Smart Defence" in the case of NATO, gathering
strategically able countries. It may occur within the EU and NATO or
outside them. Minilateralism means a "diplomatic process of a small
group of interested parties working together to supplement or complement
the activities of international organizations in tackling subjects
deemed too complicated to be addressed appropriately at the multilateral
level" (Moret 2016, p. 2). This means that being a more flexible
configuration, than formal multilateral agreements, located within
security and defence organizations, it may generate better adherence and
compliance from interested participants. In the security and defence
domain, minilateralism gathers politically willing, self-interested and
militarily able actors in order to advance what Member States perceive
to be more difficult to achieve within the binding framework of security
and defence organizations. In the European context, minilateralist
alternatives are not a novelty being envisaged (Nunes 2018, pp. 53-55)
in the Lisbon Treaty through: the mechanism of "Enhanced Cooperation"
(TEU Article 327) in the domain of the Union's non-exclusive
competences; through the 2017 Council Decision (Council Decision (CFSP),
2017/ 2315),which set forward a Permanent Structured Cooperation among
willing and able Member States and through the provision of a "Framework
Nation" concept, TEU Article 43 (1), through which the Union will retain
political control and strategic direction, while entrusting "specific
responsibilities" or tasks to a Member State in the context of a EU-led
missions and operations.25 In operational terms, minilateralism
translates into a process of aggregated and shared capabilities, as
referred earlier in the context of "Pooling & Sharing" or NATO's "Smart
Defence".

In NATO's case, due to its issue specific nature, minilateralism is
invoked in a different manner. It describes a configuration meant to
address transnational military and non-military challenges from
stabilisation operations to counter cyber and hybrid threats, often
positioned at the upper end of defence tasks due to its operational
demands. It can also adopt the format of coalitions of the willing26
where some, but not all, of the Alliance members engage in the pursuit
of security and defence goals.27 In this case, it serves the purpose of
a more rapid response to threats, with less formal legal boundaries and
complex decision-making procedures derived from international law, as
those mandatory to the United Nations and EU led-operations or from the
constitutive norms of the Washington Treaty, to which the Alliance
abides by when acting collectively.

Changes in the nature of security, the transnational consequences of
insecurity and the growing selective interdependence of interests among
security actors led to a renewed interest in minilateralism. Due to the
fact it gathers a smaller number of participants, it is better able to
promote convergence of security interests and approaches, to accelerate
responses to crises and to improve force generation, thus reducing the
impact of security dilemmas, as perceived by states and security
communities (Nunes 2017a, p. 18). This is even more relevant in complex
security contexts, where different interests and preferences prevail in
the face of multiple security challenges and in times of scarce
resources.

The "strategic bilateralism"28 although it may occur within multilateral
structures, such as international organizations, it also evolves outside
the intergovernmental structures of the EU crisis management setting and
that of the Alliance's collective defence. In these cases, international
and regional institutions may offer what Renard notes (2016, p. 31) as
the role of "framing and institutionalizing cooperation (...) and
occasionally in complementing member States, rather than substituting
for them". More often this cooperative configuration denotes a will, as
in the case of the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Canada and the
United States to favour agreements at bilateral level that safeguard
traditional foreign policy interests, outside and without the scrutiny
of multilateral fora. Mattelaer (2019, p. 13) considers that the
"prominence of bilateral diplomacy represents a symptom rather than a
cause of change in the international system". The revival of bilateral
diplomacy can be observed in a wide variety of formats from the
formality of the Lancaster House Treaty between Great Britain and
France,29 following the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty a year
earlier30 to the launch in June 2018 of the French led European
Intervention Initiative31 or the Franco-Danish Defence Cooperation,
known as the European Initiative2 (EI2)32 that followed the Council
Decision of 2017, establishing the first EU Council Decision initiative
on Permanent Structured Cooperation. The EI2 enabled Denmark to
contribute to European security and defence, outside the PESCO
arrangement.33 Lastly, the Achen Treaty on Franco-German Cooperation and
Integration, signed on the 22 January 201934 through which the two
countries agreed to "deepen their cooperation in matters of foreign
policy, defence, external and internal security and development, while
striving to strengthen Europe's ability to act autonomously" (Aachen
Treaty, 2019, Article 3). Although these initiatives have been agreed
outside the European Union and NATO they aim at strengthening them, as
referred in the preamble or provisions foresee in those declarations,
while furthering the specific interests and preferences of contracting
parts.

Being a common practice in international affairs, these three examples:
the Lancaster House Treaty, the European Intervention Initiative35 and
the Aachen Treaty36 occur in time, almost simultaneously to other
initiatives agreed with the aim to deepen European security and defence
cooperation, such as PESCO, CARD, the European Defence Fund and the
setup of a DG Defence within the European Commission. This does not
necessarily mean distrust by Member States on the political strength,
binding nature or operational output of security and defence initiatives
launched within the European Union. Strategic bilateralism supplement
and is even "conducive to stronger multilateral cooperation" (Grevi
2012, p. 16). It may suggest that multilateral initiatives agreed in
intergovernmental fora, only some of which legally binding like PESCO
and with the regulative and financial weigh of the European Commission,
such as the European Defence Fund, do not exclude the necessity of
alternative cooperative configurations, capacities and operational
output that multilateral institutions are unable, or unwilling, to
deliver as a whole, for reasons of political interest, contextual
opportunity and availability of military and non-military resources.

4\. Contexts of Opportunity for EU-NATO Cooperation

The point of debate on capability gap still holds true, whether when
comparing defence expenditures among the EU NATO member states in the
Alliance context, Europe as a whole or between Europe and the United
States.37

Twenty years later, the American political and very public discourse
calling for greater strategic responsibility by European allies,
coincided with the European Union's claim for more strategic autonomy,
following the presentation of the European Global Strategy, the launch
of several European cooperative endeavours38 and the development of
several bilateral security and defence initiatives, led by strategically
strong EU member states.39

In 2016 the lack of formal endorsement of NATO's collective defence by
the President of the United States was aggravated by the doubts casted
over the ability of European allies to allocate resources and commit to
defence in the transatlantic context. This caused a perception of
political, diplomatic and strategic "devaluation of the alliance", in
the sense attributed by Glen Snyder (1984, p. 467) and posed
self-interested conditionalities to allies, beyond the 2% of defence
spending target. Although, as Snyder (1984, p. 491) years earlier
accurately assessed, the European allies should avoid the "risk of
entrapment (consisting of) troop withdrawals, American downgrading of
the priority of European defence in favour of other areas such as the
Persian Gulf, or a further drift to unilateralism"40. These were exactly
some of the decisions adopted and initiatives taken by President Trump,
as from the earlier years of his presidency. In 2019, during the Munich
Security Conference41 former Vice President Joseph Biden, and a
potential running candidate for the Democratic Party in the 2020
Presidential election, did reiterate full support to NATO and to its
allies conveying a firm belief in the principle of collective defence.
This position was supported by the majority of the forty-five democratic
senators in the United States Senate, by various senior military
representatives at the Department of Defense, at the Pentagon and senior
diplomats and officials in Brussels, proving different perceptions
within the American political establishment. Despite the rhetoric, the
US has been increasing its commitment to Europe's eastern flank, as the
account by the Department of Defense Budget on the European Deterrence
Initiative demonstrates.42

It was in a political environment of mutual political distrust,
rhetorical and diplomatic controversy, of strained relations between
Washington and most European capitals, of fears of rising nationalism in
France, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Hungary and the announced
withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, that a second attempt43 to
formally enhance EU-NATO cooperation took place.

Despite the instability felt in Europe's neighbourhood and the
destabilizing effects caused by the consecutive interventions in Middle
East, by the regime change in Libya and by the course of American and
Russian foreign policy, the European and euroatlantic institutions
proved resilient44 to contingencies sourced in the personality of
national decision-makers and on the hindrances of party politics.

A realization that the EU-NATO cooperation was an imperative followed
two major challenges to transatlantic unity. On the one hand, the
coalition force that intervene in Kosovo (North Atlantic Council 1999a
and 1999b) with NATO, despite the absence of a United Nations mandate.
On the other, the American intervention in Afghanistan, at a time when
the United States declined to accept the possibility to invoke Article
5, in reaction to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 200145.

The 2003 EU-NATO Declaration46 paved the way to the so-called
development of a "strategic partnership" (Renard 2016b) between the EU
and NATO. This led to the Berlin Plus agreement, opening the opportunity
to the European Union to use NATO's command and control collective
structure and to institutionalise forms of cooperation and political
consultation between the two organizations in the field of crisis
management and capability development on fight against terrorism,
organized crime and cybersecurity.

In 2016, the need to foster better EU and NATO cooperation was in part a
reaction to two exogenous events. On the one hand, the potential wearing
down of transatlantic relations in the face of growing defence spending,
following the unilateral involvement of some allied countries in the
Syrian conflict and in military operations in the context of fight
against ISIS. On the other, due to a continuous ambivalence in relations
between the United States, the EU and NATO sourced in the political and
strategic narrative of American administrations against the development
of European defence integration. The notion of European Security and
Defence Identity or that of a NATO's European pillar47 prevailed over a
more autonomous European defence, while the very same administrations
pressed for a more independent operational output of European allies,
higher defence spending and stronger commitment of Europeans to NATO's
military operations.

Despite the potential for disagreement between the two organizations,
contextual events did prove their adaptability to the changing strategic
environment. NATO evolved from out-of-area to a new military stance with
the return to European and transatlantic core defence functions, after
the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. The EU/CSDP, although without
abandoning its security interests towards the near neighbourhood, turned
its security focus to the protection of its citizens, to a more
efficient response to external crises and called for better commitment
towards regional security and capacity building of partners, leading to
stronger resilience and committed ownership.48 These almost simultaneous
processes of adaptation were accompanied by a closer relation among
allies, centred on the principle of "effective multilateralism" and
strategic complementarity, contradicting the idea of competition and
duplication between the two organizations. This is a reserve frequently
expressed among policy makers and analysts, although it has been
formally addressed and solved within both organizations.

From an early stage, EU actors have denied the idea of competing or
duplicating security and defence projects by stating that CSDP will act
"where NATO as a whole is not or does not wish to get involved", a
concern repeatedly underlined since the 2001 Laeken EU Council and
reiterated in the Lisbon Treaty (Treaty of Lisbon 2007). More recently a
statement adopted by the European Defence Agency assured that "no
capacity duplication with other institutions such as NATO" would happen,
stressing that PESCO would develop as a "coherent full spectrum force
package" (EDA 2018, p. 4) in complementarity with NATO. This intention
was also reiterated by the "Implementation Plan for Security and
Defence", by the "European Defence Action Plan" and by the "Notification
letter on PESCO to the Council and High Representative". This concern
with avoiding the idea of duplication is also mirrored at the bilateral
level among those which are strategically more capable. Recent
agreements between actors such as France and Germany, as in the case of
the Achen Treaty in its Article 4, emphasises that the bilateral
commitment to reinforce cooperation between France and Germany,
regarding European security and defence is taken "In light of their
obligations under Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty of 4 April 1949
and of Article 42 (7) of the Treaty on European Union of 7 February
1992, as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon of 13 December 2007 amending
the Treaty on European Union" (Achen Treaty, 2019, Article 4 (1))
formally refuting any interpretations on duplication.

In July 2016, in Warsaw, the President of the European Council, the
President of the European Commission and NATO's Secretary General signed
an EU-NATO Joint Declaration on how to further cooperation between the
two organizations. This initiative was followed in December, of the same
year, by an agreement on a common set of proposals to implement "EU-NATO
Joint Declaration" (2016) by endorsing 42 proposals in the 7 areas
agreed: defence capabilities; capacity building; industry and research;
cyber security; hybrid threats, operational cooperation and exercises.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg called the 2016 agreement "a
milestone in our relations," recognising that "neither organisation has
the full range of tools" to address new security and defence challenges
unilaterally (NATO Meeting Ministers of Foreign Affairs 2016).

In December 2017 the Council of the European Union49 would underline the
necessity to implement the Joint Declaration reinforcing cooperation at
the strategic and operational levels between the EU and NATO. A
particular interest was placed on the collaboration between the European
Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats¸ staff level
cooperation on threat assessment regarding terrorism and on how to
counter terrorist threats. The identification of gender indicators and
assessments on how they could improve situational awareness, in support
of the UNSCR 1325 agreed in 2000, were also addressed. It was agreed to
promote EU and NATO staff presence in advisory and preparedness bodies
for missions of the respective organizations and better coordination of
EU-NATO exercises.

In 2018 a EU-NATO Joint Declaration was signed reiterating the interest
and noting the progress achieved on what regards military mobility,
counter-terrorism, cyber security, hybrid threats, resilience to
chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear related risks and
promoting the women, peace and security agenda. This was followed by the
attendance of the new High Representative Josep Borrell to NATO Defence
Ministerial meeting. At the operational level there is a continuous
cooperative effort in the Aegean Sea, where NATO has six ships helping
to implement the agreement between the EU and Turkey on the refugee
crisis, as well as support to Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean.50
This measures and actions reflect the particular security and defence
concerns of both organizations and how NATO and the EU may contribute to
mitigate them. Coherence, complementarity and interoperability remain
the three main drivers for EU-NATO cooperation and the only acceptable
and feasible in times of limited budgets and increasing new challenges
to security and defence.

However, the cumulative nature of the process of cooperation that result
from the EU-NATO Joint Declarations cooperation, rather than phased and
incremental, may be counterproductive for three reasons. First, for
reasons of capacity availability and funding. Second due to the length
of national legislative cycles, which may limit the political
willingness of Member States to pursue, in a sustainable manner, new
cooperative engagements once the political cycle has changed. Third, and
as Verbeke notes (2017, p. 5), structural projects such as those related
with states "Long term strategic interests or investments (such as
energy infrastructure or major defence platforms) are neglected in
favour of short-term tactical advantages or pet projects". This trend
may compromise the binding effect of more structural commitments, agreed
within multilateral arrangements, such as NATO and the EU.

Each Member State encloses very specific political, strategic,
diplomatic and security cultures, distinct historical legacies and
operational output. This may be determinant on how security and defence
cooperation moves forward and how Member States and participant states
accommodate alternative frameworks in multilateral, minilateral and
bilateral settings, adjusting to new processes of security governance.
Connected societies are as prone to accountability as they are to the
immediacy of results, a demand that fits poorly to the required
long-term test to which regional and international cooperation is
exposed to, in order to prove resilience to external challenges and

Cooperation]{.underline}

Despite considerable improvements leading to better institutionalization
of cooperation, between the EU and NATO, academic and policy debates are
still focused on traditional divides, which can be systematized in two
approaches: on how to address and manage security problems. Those that,
in the words of Glenn Snyder (1984:489), postulate the effectiveness of
"toughness and confrontation" and those who value a "strategy of
conciliation". This divide has been characterising the cooperative
stance between the two organizations for decades and those of Member
States foreign relations. To a certain extent, this dichotomy affects
both the analytical and strategic approach, when addressing
Euro-Atlantic security and defence relations. This varies from a
persistent concern with the division of strategic work among European
and non-European allies (Yost, 2000 and 2007); to the problem of
strategic and financial burden sharing (Kivimäki 2019; Jakobsen 2018;
National Defence Strategy 2018) and to the conditionality that results
in the fact European defence will only be welcomed by the United States
and by the more Atlanticist allies, if and when it strengthens NATO
(Brattberg 2018; BillonGalland and Thomson 2018; Leonard and Shapiro
2019). The specific concern with division of strategic work in a NATO
context and the reluctance of some Member States to embrace role
specialisation of certain security and defence tasks at the European
level, has evolved into a new perception on the disagreements registered
among allies on the Alliance collective share of risks and defence
expenses versus selective common investments in European security and
defence, through Permanent Structured Cooperation. The two moments of
strategic strain in 2003 and 2016, did not impair Euro-Atlantic
cooperation and despite concerns with duplication and competition,
developments have shown that complementarity between the two
organizations is valued the most.51

Several circumstances have been enabling better opportunities for
cooperation between the EU and NATO. First, contextual related reasons
such as the emergence of hybrid threats in the Eastern Europe, the
threat of potential and actual external interferences on allied
countries internal affairs, the consequences of the refugee crisis over
European unity and the uncertainties caused by the British referendum.52
To this already long list, one must add the internal and regional
consequences of the conflict in Syria, the position of President Donald
Trump regarding NATO and the EU creating a perception of existential
threat the long and well succeed transatlantic alliance. On the one
hand, it led to the claim that Europe should aim at a stronger role in
the security and defence of Europe. On the other, that that strengthened
position would only be supported if and when it reinforced NATO. In the
face of current security challenges, unforeseeable outcomes of
insecurity, limited resources and greater interdependency related with
the consequences of uncertainty, the development of cooperation, rather
than competition, is an expected outcome for relations among states and
within international organizations. The deterioration of insecurity in
North Africa, following the collapse of Muammar al-Gaddafi's regime in
Libya, the downfall of the so called Islamic state in the Middle East,
the consequences of revisionist foreign policies and the spread of
terrorist acts in Europe point to the diversity of sources of insecurity
and to the necessity for a more efficient and distinct form of security
and defence cooperation53, of which military cooperation is just a part.
Closer functional cooperation between the EU and NATO may help to better
deal with the uncertainties of systemic insecurity in Eastern Europe and
on the South and South-eastern rim of the Mediterranean, offering the
opportunity to safeguard distinct national and international security
interests. Decision makers and international bureaucracies should
endorse what Member States do better, whether that is crisis response or
conflict management, fight against terrorism, maritime security and
mitigation of cyber and hybrid threats, according to different strategic
cultures and interests, while fostering ownership and cooperation in
response to security challenges.

Second, [collaborative practice strives better in institutional
environments where international **socialization** among security and
defence actors is **high**]{.underline}. [In strongly connected
structures political, **[public scrutiny]{.mark}** may turn
**collaborative practice** into an instrument that [adds
**legitimacy**]{.mark}, [**better mobilizes public and political will**
and creates **more favourable conditions** to **resource**]{.mark}
security and defence agencies, such as **NATO**]{.underline} and the
EU-CSDP. NATO and the EU gather relevant strategic players, share a high
degree of membership overlap and their international security mandates
have a specific focus on European security and defence interests. This
brings into Euro-Atlantic collaborative practice both an element of
representativeness of interests and a dimension of legitimacy.

Third, power shifts in the international system may lead to changes in
the nature of security, opening up a new range of tasks for
international organizations beyond their original mandate, from military
missions to operations-other-than-war, to humanitarian relief, organized
crime eradication and disaster relief. This is reflected in new security
tasks, but also in new mobilizing arguments in the way security roles
are performed, such as preventive security, pre-emptive military action,
mitigation of hybrid threats and crisis response, rather than classical
military offensive, an option that governments and public opinions
appear to be less inclined to support. New role prescriptions not only
demand new military and non-military responses, but also a security
discourse that appeals to cooperative action, combining international
law, centred on value-based principles and arguments that serve national
interests, while suggesting further functional integration on security
and defence. Role specialisation may be an "asset" on demand given that
not all armed and security forces can afford to have the full spectrum
of capabilities required to mitigate current challenges and threats.

The institutionalisation of new forms of cooperative security, as
established between the EU-NATO, by the corresponding declarations on
cooperation of 2003, 2016 and 2018, underline the need to share risks
and responsibilities in specific security levels, notably in the context
of hybrid threats, maritime security to mitigate illegal trafficking of
human beings and search and rescue of irregular migrants at sea. A good
example of EU-NATO cooperation at the operational level was developed in
the Horn of Africa to counter maritime piracy54, together with missions
in land with the aim to develop capacity building on maritime security,
in coastal areas in the region. Other cooperative efforts were developed
in 2016, through Operation Sophia, with the aim to lessen the challenges
posed by the refugee crisis in the Aegean Sea, in combination with the
support given to the Turkish and Greek authorities and the support made
available by EU FRONTEX. In each of these missions and operations, both
NATO and the EU moved from traditional security and defence in the far
border, to counter-piracy and irregular migration in the near border.

The fourth advantage of enhancing security and defence cooperation
between the EU and NATO results from the fact that, [organizations and
the states that incorporate them commit to cooperative frameworks for
reasons of **[easier access to specialized knowledge]{.mark},
information [and resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Currently, the EU
[as]{.underline} already access to [**command** and **planning**
structures of **NATO**]{.underline}, under the Berlin Plus agreement and
in the future it can be envisaged an eventual access of NATO to the
EU-CSDP specific civilian proficiencies of the European crisis response
toolkit. The development of both the EU CSDP Civilian Compact (Council
of the European Union 2018) and the projects developed under Permanent
Structured Cooperation (Council Decision 2017) may contribute to develop
European actors roles, knowledge and experience on civilian crisis
management, while supplementing the amount of resources needed among
participant states in crisis prevention, conflict resolution and in
post-conflict situations.

[For cooperation to happen [**political will** and **trust** must be
present]{.mark}. These conditions are **[not mere technical
arrangements]{.mark}**, sometimes not even financial ones, they are a
choice that shapes the opportunity to engage collective. The
participation in new **[cooperative security frameworks]{.mark}** in
"conditions of confidence building, transparency, information
availability and knowledge"]{.underline} (Nunes 2006, p. 89), [[enable
**institutional mimetism**]{.mark} to strive among organizations, thus
**[facilitating coop]{.mark}eration** [or]{.mark} conversely
[creating]{.mark} a situation of [**perceived competition** for
**mandates** and **resources**]{.mark}. In the case of **NATO**, there
is a **growing appeal**]{.underline} among allies for it to perform
civilian security tasks for which the Alliance was not originally
created, as a political and military organization. In the case of
EU-CSDP, one observes an increasing institutionalization of conditions
aiming at a better operational deliver, following the approval of a
Security and Defence Action Plan (European Council 2016) and the
agreement on Permanent Structured Cooperation.55

Lastly, [[the fact]{.underline}]{.mark} both
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the EU [[are **politically
integrated** and **highly socialised**]{.mark}
organizations]{.underline}, bound by similar norms and interests,
[[makes]{.mark} political cooperation an opportunity and the prospect of
**[more efficient]{.mark}** operational [**collective engagement**
**more likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Cooperation is [expected to
**work better**]{.mark} in an **interdependent security
environment**]{.underline}, where multiple memberships to organizations
are present and where resources scarcity or uneven distribution of
resources occurs [turning cooperation into a **more advantageous** and
**less costly** alternative]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- Norm-Setting

#### Counterplan forfeits NATO's [norm-setting power]{.underline}

[But **ad hoc** approaches also **pose challenges** to]{.underline}
organizations like **[NATO]{.underline}**. [Madeleine Albright warned
against]{.underline} the "three Ds" in the 1990s when she highlighted
[the risks of [**de-linking** from]{.mark}, or **duplicating [NATO
efforts]{.mark}**, as well as **discriminating** among
members]{.underline}.24 [These issues remain an important
concern---particularly in U.S. policy discussions -- when it comes to
more recent ad hoc or minilateral formats focused on European
defense]{.underline}. A more concerted NATO role in guiding flexible
efforts within the alliance could help address this concern to minimize
redundancies and buttress cohesion.

[NATO should work as much as possible with members]{.underline} and
partners [to ensure minilateral formats complement, rather than compete
with, the alliance]{.underline}. Moreover, NATO should consider how it
can more effectively apply the lessons of these formats to its
partnership policy to craft a more flexible approach. This includes
lessons from previous efforts to create flexible formats within the
alliance.

There are few metrics to evaluate a model's success. In many ways,
weighing the differences between minilateral arrangements outside larger
multilateral frameworks and flexible formats inside them is tantamount
to comparing apples and oranges. But there are a few factors that are
instructive, including mutual interest in cooperation, shared threat
perceptions and security priorities (which are often aligned with
geographic location), and a high level of ambition of all involved
participants. Moreover, on a procedural level, clear, defined goals and
a focus on outputs, coupled with regular consultations, can help drive
success. Ad hoc formats with lean and focused structures that are built
around voluntary participation allow for quicker responses---especially
in crisis situations---but they may be less suited to driving and
verifying success on long term deliverables and capability goals.

Flexible formats embedded within NATO, like the FNC and the NATO+N
model, or alongside NATO in the case of PESCO can increase agility for
member and partner cooperation. [But the **diminishing
enthusiasm**]{.underline} around the German FNC and challenges
surrounding PESCO funding [indicate **continued hurdles**]{.underline}.
The NATO+N model has proven effective in engaging two or three partners
around common regional security challenges (for example, NATO members,
Finland, and Sweden). Yet, [its limits [risk a **default
bilateralization**]{.mark}]{.underline} or trilateralization [of NATO's
engagement with partners [and]{.mark} may **[fail to leverage a broader
capacity]{.mark}** of partnerships]{.underline}.

In its effort to create greater political cohesion in Euro-Atlantic
defense, NATO cannot ignore the application and improvement of its
flexible partnership engagement. The [tendency of NATO
members]{.underline} and partners [to participate in various
**minilateral** formats [has **significant implications**]{.mark}. If
NATO cannot figure out how to engage partners more effectively and
flexibly, they and members may **increasingly** be **inclined** to
engage in various **minilateral** formats rather than NATO or simply
pursue **bilateral** ties. In this context, **[NATO]{.mark}**
partnerships could [end up as **little more than a "talk shop,"**
**forfeiting**]{.mark} the alliance's **[agenda-setting
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Deficit -- Political Sustainability

#### Counterplan [tanks public support for NATO]{.underline} -- key to [sustain U.S. membership]{.underline}

and US Foreign Policy: Where's the Multilateralism?" International

[Policymakers tend to assume that foreign aid can attract public support
only to the extent that it is perceived to serve narrowly focused
national interests. Yet]{.underline}, the 1995 survey found that
humanitarian rationales for aid attracted the strongest support.
Americans were less inclined to favor aid programs designed to reward
friendly countries or to win economic benefits for US business.
**[[Military aid]{.underline}]{.mark}** was also **[[quite
unpopular]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But majorities ranging from 74% to 91%
wanted to maintain or increase aid devoted to ends such as child
survival, humanitarian relief, repairing the environment, family
planning, and long-term economic development. There existed strong
support for targeting aid toward the poorest countries. Americans were
skeptical, however, that aid actually reaches those who need it or
achieves humanitarian aims. Roughly 80% of respondents believed that too
much aid went to undemocratic regimes, that aid is plagued by waste and
corruption, and that foreign assistance programs often foster dependence
on the part of recipients.11

One obvious implication of these findings is that advocates for
increased foreign aid would do well to correct public misperceptions
that the United States is bearing a disproportionate burden as compared
with other aid-giving countries. Yet, research conducted by the Aspen
Institute suggests that the problem is more complicated: ''When
informants were confronted with such information, they showed momentary
surprise, and then reverted to their old patterns of reasoning. A core
rule of strategic frame analysis is at play here: if the facts don't fit
the frame, it is the facts that are rejected, not the frame'' (Bales
2001:8).

A better strategy for mobilizing public support for aid is to emphasize
America's shared responsibility to respond to human suffering in concert
with others. This approach shifts the focus from interests to values and
assures members of the public that the burden is not borne by the United
States alone. [Funneling [increasing]{.mark} proportions of US [aid
through **bilateral rather than multilateral** mechanisms]{.mark}
actually [**undercuts the appeal of aid** by reinforcing erroneous
**perceptions** that **America is on its own**]{.mark}]{.underline} when
it comes to fighting hunger, disease, and natural disasters. [[Placing
aid within a **multilateral context**]{.mark}, by contrast,
**[highlights the contributions of other states]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
A 2010 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey found that only 8%
supported the view that the United States should continue to serve as
the pre-eminent leader in responding to international problems. On the
other hand, only 19% felt that the United States should withdraw from
efforts to solve most international problems. Instead, a large
majority---71%---adopted the view that the United States should do its
share in cooperation with other countries.

More generally, [[**public support** for **multilat**]{.mark}**eral
engagement** [**rises** when the]{.mark} domestic [audience is primed
through]{.mark} exposure to **[cooperative
frames]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Framing involves the use of metaphors,
analogies, and symbols that serve to cue up desired associations among
audience members with respect to a given issue. Research conducted by
the Aspen Institute has found that, in comparisons with a control group,
respondent attitudes toward multilateral engagement abroad shifted in a
positive direction when previously exposed to statements stressing
interdependence, partnership, and shared norms among states and
societies. This research also suggested that policymakers must convince
members of the public that global problems are not intractable but
instead amenable to feasible solutions.

[Despite recent survey results pointing to declining support for
international engagement, the challenge for policymakers who seek to
overcome domestic obstacles to international engagement is less to
expand the breadth of public support for such initiatives than to deepen
the salience of multilateralism among members of the
public]{.underline}. [Passive and [**shallow majorities** in
favor]{.mark} of international cooperation [**do little to counter** the
influence of **mobilized interests who oppose multilat**]{.mark}**eral
engagement** or to overcome misperceptions among politicians who
mistakenly read the public as unilateralist. [A **president** **seeking
domestic support for a multilat**]{.mark}**eral [agenda]{.mark}** in US
foreign policy **[must]{.mark}** therefore **craft a compelling
narrative** that serves to awaken and **[mobilize]{.mark}** the latent
**[public support]{.mark}** that has to date remained dormant and
underutilized]{.underline}.

### T/N -- Miscalc

#### Counterplan's [signal]{.underline} of [subregional fragmentation]{.underline} causes [miscalc]{.underline} -- [escalates]{.underline} to global war

[[**No matter** how]{.mark} one might [assess **sub-regional force
balances**]{.mark}, the [**assumption** that]{.mark} an [aggression
against]{.mark} a **[NATO]{.mark}** ally [could be **limited to** a
**sub-regional war** seems **flawed**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Nevertheless, a narrow focus on sub-regional Russian geographical
advantages]{.underline} as to quick movements of land forces [has been
shaping the western discussion on military response
options]{.underline}.

[But launching a deliberate major aggression against an alliance that
disposes at superior conventional forces and positive security
guarantees by nuclear powers [would entail **incalculable risks**
of]{.mark} a **[global war]{.mark}**. This is not a plausible
scenario]{.underline}.

**[[This is why]{.underline}]{.mark}** the German government and
[western European allies during the Warsaw **[NATO]{.mark}**
Summit]{.underline}7 [in]{.underline} July [2016
[insisted]{.mark}]{.underline} that the purpose of an enhanced forward
presence is a limited one: It aims [[at **sending a strategic signal**
that the **alliance cannot be divided** **rather than**]{.mark} trying
to [engage in an **arms race** to win **sub-regional military
superiority**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, they rejected requests
to station several heavy brigades and to build-up new military
frontlines in contradiction to the restraint commitment enshrined in the
NATO-Russia Founding Act of 1997.8

[The true core of the issue is that changing force postures and military
doctrines, forward deployment of new units and the **[increase of
military activities]{.mark}** such as large scale manoeuvres, snap
exercises [without prior notification]{.mark} and near border
reconnaissance flights [are]{.mark} a matter [of great concern]{.mark},
especially if accompanied by **[dangerous brinkmanship]{.mark}** which
[can **spin out of control**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This concern is all
the more relevant since a sense of a new confrontation is dominating
political discourses in East and West and the narratives on the root
causes of conflict have developed in opposite and incompatible
directions.

#### It's the nightmare scenario

The final scenario envisages [a more organic and fluid European security
system]{.underline}, evolving without the conscious architectural design
of the first three models, and [taking shape through a process of mutual
give and take]{.underline}. It is a model of a Europe of independent
nation-states, defending their national interests but [cooperating
together for mutual benefit, **[without]{.mark}** attempting to create a
[**hierarchical security architecture** or **overarching multilateral
governance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this scenario, European security
would [involve shifting patterns of **[bilat]{.mark}eral**,
**minilateral** and multilateral cooperation, with ad hoc groupings
('coalitions of the willing') forming to deal with specific problems,
and a '**variable geometry**' of **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation** developing across the continent. This [is a
vision]{.mark} of Europe [that **lacks many**]{.mark} **committed
[advocates]{.mark}**; indeed, it is one which is [**widely viewed** as
the **nightmare scenario**, involving]{.mark} a
'**[renationalisation]{.mark}**' [of security policy]{.mark},
**[multipolar instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and a situation in
which -- in Thucydides words -- the strong do what they will, and the
weak do what they must.
