More broadly, [**alternativity in [critical IR theory]{.mark}** [needs
to be rescued from **never-ending conceptual reifications**]{.mark},
which have ended up making **ontological assentation** about the world
become **[completely detached from the world]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In
this regard, [there is a **growing realization in IR** that
"**critique** is a necessary but **secondary** task; the **priority** is
to **return to practical theory as quickly as possible**"]{.underline}
(Levine 2012, 69). [Recalibrating the purpose of alternativity in
critical theory [requires]{.mark} recalibrating knowledge production,
[**not only** to **unmask power relations** and]{.mark} the dynamics of
dominance and to **[create space]{.mark}** for a politics of resistance
[**but also** to **generate practical knowledge** for **political
action**]{.mark} that challenges, confronts, and disrupts existing power
relations [and **offer**]{.mark}**s [alternative solutions]{.mark}** for
reshuffling social relations on more emancipatory and inclusive
terms]{.underline} (see Duvall and Varadarajan 2003, 85; Murdie 2017;
Deiana and McDonagh 2018). A feature of critical peace and conflict
studies is [a **congruence** between the **emancipatory** and
**problem-solving** perspectives]{.underline}, which should be
predicated on the conciliation of knowledge, the expansion of
onto-politics of peace, and the pluralization of epistemological and
methodological approaches. The recent methodological work by J. Samuel
Barkin and Laura Sjoberg (2017) on interpretive quantification is a
promising move toward this much-needed pluralist fertilization within
critical theory. [In particular, [a **stronger linkage** between]{.mark}
criticality, [**alternativity**, and **practicality** could help
**critical security**]{.mark}]{.underline}, peace, and conflict
[theories to **offer alternatives** that would **maintain critical
impetus** while simultaneously **strengthening ties to practical and
societal problem-addressing solutions**]{.underline}. [**Genealogical
studies** would [**blend well** with]{.mark} a critical analysis of
conceptual and **[policy alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see
Milliken 1999). Statistical analysis with an emancipatory hypothesis
coupled with critical analysis [[would **contribute to subverting policy
practices** and]{.mark} would **normalize alternative knowledge** about
peace, justice, and emancipation]{.underline}.

[The recent **practice-turn in IR** offers new **bridges** between
scholars and practitioners, making it possible to [**translate critical
knowledge into practice** **without compromising**]{.mark} the
[**normativity** and **criticality**]{.mark} of scholarly
works]{.underline} (see Bigo 2011). A forum on pragmatism published in
this journal has implicitly highlighted the importance of alternativity
in [understanding global politics and generating impactful knowledge
beyond the existing epistemological and methodological
divides]{.underline} (see Hellmann 2009). Friedrichs and Kratochwil
(2009, 701) have argued for "the orientation of research toward the
generation of useful knowledge." [**Practicality is essential** for
**generating alternatives**]{.underline}. For instance, Jonna Nyman
(2016, 142) argues that "a pragmatic, practice-centred approach . . .
can help us gain practical knowledge of how security works and
understand the value of security better, as well as help us to suggest
alternative possibilities." Similarly, Navnita Chadha Behera (2016, 154)
argues: "theorizing in IR needs to step out of the rarefied atmosphere
of its academe, develop a healthy scepticism toward its canonical
frames, and open up to the possibilities of learning from everyday life
and experiences of people and their living traditions and practices."
Practicality shifts the focus from abstract criticality and normativity
to contextual critiques that account for everyday practices and
interactions. This would be essential for rescuing critique from
becoming a postempirical endeavor.

[[**Critical knowledge** that **engages with policy
alternatives**]{.mark} "is not only pragmatic, it [is]{.mark} also
**[politically enabling]{.mark}**: it [forces us **away from**]{.mark}
instrumental [**problem-solving perspectives** towards a **wider
framework of pragmatic thought** where **narrow instrumental goals** are
**overridden by**]{.mark} wider **[normative]{.mark}** and **political**
[concerns]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Kurki 2013, 260). [Such grounded
critiques are crucial in order to expand non-prescriptive alternativity
and exploring practical possibilities for social emancipation and
change]{.underline}. For Steve Smith (2002: 202), "[the **acid test**
for the **success** of alternative and **critical approaches** is the
extent to which they have led to **empirically grounded work** that
explores the range and variety of world politics]{.underline}." This
would also be [congruent with]{.underline} Daniel Levine\'s (2012, 30)
concept of sustainable critique, which [entails thinking in both
practical and critical terms at once so that "IR could create a
sustainably critical perspective on global politics that might then be
**turned back onto**, and made [to **inform**]{.mark}, ongoing **[policy
debates]{.mark}** and discourses]{.underline}." Behera (2016, 154)
further maintains that the "state-centric ontology of IR has effectively
ended up dehumanizing the discipline in a way so that normally it has
little to do with human relations, human needs, and the larger
imperatives of humanity." Generating practical alternatives would
therefore require endorsing situated knowledge as an epistemological and
methodological basis for any engagement with the real world. The work of
feminists such as Donna Haraway (1988, 584) on situated standpoints is
also relevant here because they offer "more adequate, sustained,
objective, transforming accounts of the world." Situated knowledge is,
mostly, nonrepresentational knowledge, in that it is not firmly mediated
through preexisting discourses. In this regard, promoting subjugated
knowledge discourses and practices could be central to rejuvenating the
emancipatory commitment of critical theory (see Doty 1996).

[Situated **alternatives could derive from emplaced and embodied
knowledge** and could have a more emancipatory character as they "bring
forth the importance of recognizing, valuing, and employing marginalized
voices by working from this perspective, as well as by **reshaping
research to include marginalized communities as part of knowledge
production**"]{.underline} (McHugh 2015, 62). For Robson and McCartan
(2016, 3), "real world research looks to examine personal experience,
social life and social systems, as well as related policies and
initiatives. It endeavours to understand the lived in reality of people
in society and its consequences." Milja Kurki\'s (2013, 245) recent
study of democracy promotion has approached alternativity from the
perspective of policy provocations, which focus "on not prioritising one
or another perspective, but rather on encouraging self-reflection by all
practitioners, which in turn is considered as a key condition of seeking
adequately pluralism-fostering reforms in concrete policy frameworks."
Kurki (2013, 248--51) further maintains that "[**instead of relying on
objective knowledge** and criteria, **policy process can and should be
attuned to the logic of interpretive, politicised and participatory
judgements**]{.underline}." Her study is an excellent example of
pragmatic congruence between criticality and alternativity, whereby
policy alternatives are not geared toward totally improving or enhancing
the current system but openly promote more pluralistic, reflexive, and
emancipatory policies for democratization and peacebuilding.

Moreover, for these new grounds of critical alternativity to be
introduced in practice, knowledge production should be decentered,
decolonized, and "de-methodolised" (see Lisle 2014). R. B. J. Walker
(2002, 265) has argued that "the key achievement of supposedly
alternative and critical literatures over the past two decades has been
to open up at least some possibility of asking questions about the
location and character of the political." As elaborated in this study,
knowledge production in peace and conflict studies is predominantly
based on Western epistemologies, which are shaped by specific cultures
of thought, self-perpetuated epistemological superiority, and codified
academic practices. Most of the international scholarship on
postconflict societies derives from an unrepresentative body of
knowledge, which tries to mediate, deviate, reinterpret, and,
consequently, construct a different social reality that is interpreted
through different measurements, reference points, and analytical
concepts (see Latour 2005). This has greatly limited the possibility for
proposing realizable alternatives. Due to these epistemological
anomalies, there are growing calls in scholarship to decolonize
knowledge from Eurocentric and Western dominance and instead to pursue
more pluralist and particularist modes of knowledge (Smith 2012). For
instance, Acharya and Buzan (2010, 2) have argued that [IR theory should
be "an open domain into which it is not unreasonable to expect
non-Westerners to make a contribution at least proportional to the
degree that they are involved in its practice]{.underline}." Similarly,
Andrew Hurrell (2016, 151) has proposed that "[the pathway to a global
IR will need to look beyond 'IR' and is likely to require new models for
organizing social science research and knowledge
production]{.underline}." Decolonized epistemologies of peace would
reverse the order of knowledge, placing the local first and then the
regional and international as spatial and ontological scales for
understanding peace processes (Visoka 2017). They would not operate in
isolation but would engage in shaping global IR knowledge. Therefore, a
genuine search for achievable alternatives should try to decolonize
peace knowledge from Western and Eurocentric frameworks, interrogate
decolonized knowledge and agencies, and explore the joint constitution
of international intervention and local resistance (see Smith 2012;
Memmi 2006). Local scholars often have rich knowledge, but the primary
usage of it is not for instrumental purposes or for transferring and
sharing with audiences of outsiders. Local knowledge is very much used
to respond to narrow practical and everyday interests and needs and, as
such, is embedded in the logic of generating sufficient knowledge to
respond to specific circumstances.

In the context of peacebuilding, as examined in this article, generating
alternatives from the ground up has the potential to bring about more
sustainable forms of peace and reconciliation for groups and societies
affected by violent conflict. [**Situated alternatives** for
emancipatory peace are [**more prone to avoiding co-optation** by
**positivist** and **problem-solving** **epistemic predators**,
resulting]{.mark} thus [in]{.mark} developing [pluriversal]{.mark}
political and peace [orders **beyond liberal peacebuilding**]{.mark} and
other Eurocentric impositions]{.underline}. [From this situated
perspective, emancipation could take the shape of "the transformation of
structures and relationships of vulnerability through localized
political action, aimed at the creation of spaces in people\'s lives so
that they are enabled to make decisions and act beyond mere
survival]{.underline}" (Basu and Nunes 2013, 69). Emancipatory
alternatives would not be universal in their applications because such
an attempt is not viable. [Rather the focus should be on searching for
practical emancipatory possibilities within a given context, time,
space, and place]{.underline} (see Fierke 2007, 24). In other words,
[critiques with an adequate dose of alternativity are **more likely to
generate globally understandable and locally impactful
knowledge**]{.underline}. Nevertheless, alternativity does not
necessarily have to be predicated on representative views of the
world---it can also be a by-product of performing hope and imagined
possibilities in global politics. Shapiro (2013, xiv) argues that
critical thinking helps to "create the conditions of possibility for
imaging alternative worlds." That said, as the purpose of critical
theory is emancipatory change, any alternative theoretical and empirical
observation in service of improving the human conditions should generate
a morally and practically acceptable standpoint. Because any attempt to
establish an alternative interpretation inevitably "empowers a
particular social and political standpoint" (Price and
**[Reus-Smit]{.underline}** 1998, 261). According to Ní Mhurchú and
Shindo (2016, 5), "critique can help us to develop different ways of
talking about, evaluating, doing and interrogating the changing nature
of politics, relations and experiences of the international in a
globalising world." Hence, critique is inevitably implicated in
world-making and, with a much clearer understanding of alternativity,
can steer the thrust for world-changing in a more emancipatory, just,
and inclusive direction.

Conclusion

[Emancipation is a central feature of critical IR debates, but scholars
often **fail to develop alternatives** or **solutions achieving
emancipation** in practice]{.underline}. This article has examined the
relationship between criticality and alternativity in IR in order to
shed light on some of the most contested issues of critical theory,
namely, the epistemological pathways for identifying the inconsistencies
and flaws in existing knowledge and practices and the extent to which
critical knowledge should generate alternative emancipatory
possibilities. The article has argued that [alternativity provides an
opportunity for critical scholars to **remain relevant without being
affiliated with positivist logics of inquiry**]{.underline}. In
unpacking the conceptual contours, the article first explored how
different branches of critical IR engage with the episteme of
alternativity. The analysis found that [although alternativity is often
affiliated with problem-solving epistemologies, it has played a major
role in shaping critical knowledge in IR]{.underline}. While this is
acknowledged and endorsed at the epistemological level by a branch of
critical scholars who engage in normative and reconstructive modes of
critique, other [scholars embedded in **deconstructive modes of
critique** have **disregarded the merits of alternativity in
IR**]{.underline}. The article has argued that, [**[contrary to what
is]{.mark} often [assumed]{.mark}, [alternativity is not incompatible
with deconstructive]{.mark}** or reconstructive **[critiques]{.mark}**
across different subdisciplines of IR. Yet **critical IR debates,**
which have now become the **new mainstream in IR**, have failed to
engage with the episteme of alternativity in a more empirical and
practical sense. They preach emancipation but **fail to develop tangible
emancipatory alternatives**]{.underline}.

[As a result, there is a growing realization that, without tangible
alternativity, critical theory risks losing its normative impetus and
its ethical and emancipatory commitment, potentially becoming a
post-epistemological vocation without politics]{.underline}. [Critical
knowledge **[without]{.mark}** a dose of **[alternativity]{.mark}** may
examine the causes and consequences of subject matters but could [**fall
short** of **reaching out** to the **wider policy community**]{.mark}
and the **affected subjects** where power relations reside, thus
[**missing the opportunity** to **transform**]{.mark} the
[**structural**, **discursive**, and **performative** practices that
reproduce **violence**]{.mark}, **inequality**, and i**njustice** on
human and nonhuman ecology]{.underline}. To bridge this epistemological
gap, the analysis in the second part of this article examined how
alternativity features in peace and conflict studies, a disciplinary
field known for adding normative, empirical, and practical substance to
critical IR debates. The analysis offered a conceptual scoping of three
modes of critique and alternativity in peace and conflict studies. The
three modes of critique showed that a conjunction between criticality
and alternativity is possible and that it is necessary to renew the
practical and emancipatory potential of critical theory in IR. The three
modes of alternativity in peace and conflict studies expose a spectrum
of different critiques, ranging from those perspectives that disengage
completely from conceptual and empirical alternatives, to more pragmatic
and prescriptive approaches.

Critique-without-alternative represents one strand, which tends to avoid
offering normative and practical alternatives to their critical
reflections aimed at maintaining the conservative and radical impetus of
critical theory and dissociating from problem-solving and
policy-relevant methods of inquiry. This mode of critique is committed
to revealing the weaknesses of peacebuilding interventions but refuses
to offer any emancipatory and practical alternative on how to build
sustainable peace after violent conflict. [If the end goal of critical
perspectives is achieving emancipation, then critique should not only be
directed toward problematizing dominant discourses, practices, and
policies but also needs to envisage political and practical alternatives
rooted in ideational and material elements. In turn, the **lack of an
explicit emancipatory agenda** [**limits** their **social and political
impact** and]{.mark} unintentionally **[validates the existing
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In response to this challenge, a new mode
of critique has emerged, namely, critique-as-alternative, which
exemplifies the optimal approach. Proponents of critique-as-alternative
have remained committee to critical analysis, but most importantly, they
have taken up the challenge of offering emancipatory knowledge that has
practical relevance for vulnerable societies in global politics. Their
main flaw, however, has been their inability to elaborate sufficiently
their practical and emancipatory alternatives---a flaw that has opened
up space for epistemic contestation and policy co-optation. Finally, the
third mode of critique---critique-with-alternative---which is embedded
in a positivist, problem-solving, and policy-driven logic of inquiry,
offers alternatives that seek either to verify existing knowledge and
the existing interventionary order or to reject other critical
alternatives.

Looking at different modes of critique through the lens of alternativity
in IR\'s subdiscipline of peace and conflict studies has provided
interesting insights on the promise and limits of critical IR in shaping
global politics. The analysis found that existing modes of critique have
failed to develop elaborative emancipatory alternatives at both the
conceptual and the practical levels. To infuse critique-with-alternative
with emancipatory elements, expand the epistemological scope of
critique-without-alternative, and operationalize further the practical
solutions offered by this mode of critique, substantial changes are
needed. This article has suggested [exploring postparadigmatic
approaches of inquiry]{.underline} in order to [avoid existing
epistemological entrapments and limitations, reclaiming the practical
relevance of critical theory through pragmatic, reflexive, and situated
alternatives---across the conceptual, normative, and empirical
spectrums---and promoting decolonized, bottom-up methods of knowledge
production]{.underline}. The existing modes of [critique require
pursuing more **nonconflictual** and **postparadigmatic**
**epistemologies**, embracing situated knowledge and reclaiming and
expanding its **practical relevance**, breaking away from
**geo-epistemological hierarchies**, and opening up to **post-Western
IR**]{.underline}. To conclude, [**promoting alternativity** has the
potential to **rejuvenate critical scholarship** embedded in the ethos
of impactful engagement with the world **without being co-opted by the
policy world**]{.underline}. [The next challenge for scholars should not
be whether alternativity and criticality are congruent but how
emancipatory alternatives can renew the social and political purpose of
critical theory and **make an impact in the real world**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

IR theory has undoubtedly been 'in a state of disarray' for several
decades now,96 and the approach espoused above does not necessarily seek
to turn things around. One thing that [praxeological
deconstructionism]{.underline}, as a 'third way', [seeks to]{.underline}
do, however, is to [show that efforts at [theory building and social
transformation are **complementary**]{.mark} in most cases; hence
[researchers should]{.mark} maintain the liberty to **[pick and choose
from various perspectives to inform their particular case
studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many theoretical approaches have had
similar ambitions but I find that IR is still taking baby-steps towards
what I have envisioned as a 'third way', which grows from the continuous
frustration with the problem-solving/critical theory binary in the
field. I insist on [intellectual diversity and theoretical
pluralism]{.underline} but at the same time diversity and pluralism
should be [underpinned by]{.underline} the need for [genuine
cross-communication and multi-disciplinarity]{.underline}. This [escapes
the 'paradigmatic paramountcy' of either rationalist or critical
approaches,]{.underline}97 [thereby improving dialogue and furthering
disciplinary growth]{.underline}.

In sum, the case this paper has made is that, without the careful
synthesis of the multiplicity of approaches and perspectives that best
capture the field as 'international', thereby incorporating alternative
and marginalised perspectives, the future of IR as a field that
contributes meaningfully to addressing the problems of the day will
remain untapped. So far, I have argued that [[deconstruction **alone**
is not enough. One has to]{.mark} have a conversation after
deconstruction and then [try to reconstruct in both theoretical and
pragmatic ways]{.mark}, bearing in mind the dangers of reconstruction.
[This would allow research not **only** to understand the world **but
also to change it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some theorists who are set in
their ways will ask: is synthesis of the IR field possible? Is it even
desirable? I would say 'yes' to both questions. The need for a synthetic
'third way' has arisen; one that is neither essentialised as
problem-solving nor critical, but which embraces some relevant
assumptions of both. More importantly, nevertheless, [[IR
theorists]{.underline}]{.mark} (particularly of the 'post' tradition)
[[should **get out of their ivory tower** to espouse theories that are
**self-critical**, **meaningful** and **continually relevant**
to]{.mark} the [human experiences]{.mark} of the agents/subjects they
study. **[This is the purpose of theory!]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### [Our]{.underline} framework solves their offense, but [their]{.underline} framework links to ours. 

**Andrews 13** --- Nathan Andrews, Trudeau and Vanier Scholar in the
Department of Political Science at the University of Alberta (Canada),
former Banting Postdoctoral Fellow at Queen\'s University (Canada),

Deconstructionism' as a 'Third Way' in IR Theorising," *Third World

Institutions via Taylor & Francis Online, p. 67-69)

The second premise derives from some critical scholars' refusal to offer
specific alternatives. Richard Ashley (as well as [many post-structural,
postcolonial, and post-development scholars]{.underline}), for instance,
will [argue that it is not the goal of critical theory to provide
alternatives, as such an endeavour defeats the self-reflexivity that
undergirds the theory. But this is problematic because, while these
theories reveal the agency in the theory, there is no clarity of purpose
in terms of 'actionable' leeway for the agent]{.underline}. Also,
instead of glorifying realism, for instance as offering a 'timeless
wisdom',66 [the followers in this camp should be more reflexive so as to
overcome the inert determinism and parochialism that underpin their
theorising]{.underline}. Closely related to the second justification is
the argument that [[the purpose]{.mark} of both theoretical and
empirical analyses [is not only to understand the world **but**]{.mark}
**also [to change it]{.mark}**. This [change is **not possible**
if]{.mark} critical [theorists engage **solely in inward-looking
critiques**]{.mark} **of existing theories** [without providing **a
programmatic understanding of what their perspectives entail** or **how
the existing condition can improve**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[end page
67\] Additionally, as the need for theoretical pluralism becomes more
apparent, PD assists in making sure the notion of 'pluralism' moves from
being a buzzword to an actual practice. Essentially most IR theories
have four main themes in common: power, order, structure and
agency---although the emphasis placed on each of these elements differs
from theory to theory. Praxeologically oriented deconstruction helps to
elucidate these four components without taking any aspect of them for
granted. The argument here recognises the ontological and
epistemological difficulties one falls into when thinking of a 'third
way'---the difficulty of having so many established scholars and
theorists disagree with the approach on many grounds, even including
grounds of originality and usefulness. But the point is that, while we
emphasise, for instance, what Ashley calls the 'four p's'---process,
practice, power and politics67---we need to explore the structure and
utility of the state in contemporary world politics---and by so doing
unveil the axes of domination in existing structures. This is therefore
an approach which symbolises the mutually constitutive synergies between
knowledge/theory and praxis/practice, as explained below, rather than
one that seeks to revolutionise the entire field of study by turning it
upside down.

This approach does not simply seek to reimagine 'deconstruction' but
rather attempts to show that [[deconstruction, **without
praxis**,]{.mark} ends at a point which [leaves the individual]{.mark}
subject [unable to ascertain]{.mark} what [options of social
transformation]{.mark} are [available]{.mark}]{.underline}.68 The main
contention in recent times has been between those who call themselves
'rationalists' and the 'constructivists', although neither possesses a
concise set of theoretical and methodological assumptions that explain
the entirety of IR. [As the socio-political phenomena IR addresses are
often subjective and context-specific, there is no 'scientific truth' to
be had which will transcend space and time]{.underline}. The ontology of
PD, as evident from Figure 1, is that there is no one world or 'truth'
out there, if any, and in the same manner there is no single way of
knowing or standard by which 'good' knowledge is measured. In this case
'truth is always contingent, always a matter for debate and always
partial', meaning that 'truth is not "out there", waiting to be
discovered'.69 Rather, there are multiple understandings which reside in
\[end page 68\] different sites---times and spaces. [[A 'third way'
is]{.mark} thus [crucial]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially [[for]{.mark}
people who are concerned with [**both** discursive interpretations
**and** real (emancipatory) alternatives]{.mark}]{.underline}.70 [It is
only in this way that the discipline can become transformative or
pro-change while taking into cognisance the fact that change can occur
from both within and outside established arenas of power]{.underline}.
PD also shows that [[there is no point in '**throwing the baby out with
the bathwater**']{.mark}; although the water is dirty, the baby can be
saved lest the purpose of bathing the baby itself becomes
self-defeating]{.underline}. This speaks to the freedom and flexibility
this approach gives to the researcher in choosing from multiple
perspectives.71

#### The [most important question]{.underline} is: How can we [actually make the world]{.underline} a better place? Only [our framework]{.underline} asks it.

Contours of praxeological deconstructionism: research programme54

[It remains problematic to think along the lines of the strict
distinction]{.underline} Robert Cox makes [between
problem-solving]{.underline} or rationalist theories [and
critical]{.underline} or interpretivist [theories]{.underline} of IR
[because]{.underline} in essence **[['\[all\] theory is political and
\[all\] political action is theory-laden']{.underline}]{.mark}**.55 [The
rigidity that comes with]{.underline} the [two main]{.underline}
approaches, or ['theoretical churches']{.underline}, [does
no]{.underline} specific [good]{.underline} to the field in general.
[While there is dignity in difference, there is hope in some degree of
commonality]{.underline}. The approach being promoted here is more
congenial to critical theory thanks to its reflexivity but it also
embraces mixed methods. [The quest is to problematise [the]{.mark}
'problem-solving/critical theory' [binary]{.mark}]{.underline} that we
have been presented with in the field of IR, [based on the argument that
it [is arbitrary and]{.mark} often [a misrepresentation of]{.mark} the
many [theories]{.mark} and research traditions [that]{.mark} often
attempt to [exhibit **both**]{.mark} characteristics]{.underline}. In
some cases what is considered to be solving a problem actually solves
nothing, since the theory can be so removed from the world 'out there'
that it attempts to describe, revealing an overpowering 'practicality
deficit' in the theory's core assumptions.56

My proposition for a 'third way' is based on these premises: First,
[historically some [critical]{.mark} theorists [have borrowed from
problem-solving]{.mark} theorists, [and vice]{.mark}]{.underline} \[end
page 66\] [[versa]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, a feminist
theorist like Ann Tickner has attempted to reformulate realism.57 While
there are many variants of feminism, some of them appear to begin their
theorising with an acknowledgement of traditional realists such as Hans
Morgenthau.58 The point here is that some critical theories seem to have
built upon some of the assumptions of problem-solving theories, although
others deconstruct and reject them outright. After all, Cynthia Enloe
has argued that a book about international politics should leave one
with a sense that 'I can do something', a more instrumental and
affirmative orientation that most IR books lack.59

Let me note at this point that I find this approach receptive to the
kind of scholarship being pursued by [some critical feminist
scholars]{.underline}. Such scholars [have been successful at borrowing
from problem-solving theories, yet still with a quest for progressive
change]{.underline}. In their analysis of social movements, for
instance, Meyer and Lupo argue that feminism's uniqueness derives from
its ability to consistently illuminate the relationship between self and
community.60 Critical feminist scholarship is interested in processes of
domination that are often silenced by the mainstream's fetishism with
the state, power and anarchy, a commitment that results from the 'lived
injustices' or sufferings of marginalised groups.61 Thus, feminist
scholars' commitment to emancipatory politics is 'aimed at transforming
relations of inequality and domination'.62 Additionally, feminist
scholars have carefully examined the concept of intersectionality, which
mainly emphasises the interwoven nature of race, class, gender and
sexuality in order to show the mutually constitutive nature of identity
and structures of inequality.63 And 'because intersectional knowledge is
grounded in everyday lives of people of diverse backgrounds, it is seen
as an important tool linking theory with practice'.64 These 'feminist
characteristics' are elements that the approach espoused below
identifies with and, in fact, I hope that the notion of PD will
encourage discussions among scholars interested in progressive social
change through research. [As some critical scholars are already doing,
[we should]{.mark} particularly [ask: '**how should we do our research
in order to increase the likelihood that it will actually help make the
world a better place?**']{.mark}]{.underline}.65

#### No neg offense --- critical theory and problem-solving theory [aren't mutually exclusive]{.underline}.

International Relations ([IR]{.underline}) [theory is typically divided
into]{.underline} two: [traditional]{.underline} (often known as
[problem-solving]{.underline}/rationalist) [theory and
critical]{.underline} (often referred to as reflectivist/interpretivist)
[theory]{.underline}. Traditional theories remain the most predominant
in the field of study as they often have powerful proponents and a
larger number of disciples. The Oxford English Dictionary defines
tradition as 'a long established and generally accepted custom or method
of procedure, having almost the force of a law'.3 In this context
anything 'traditional' is 'observant \[end page 59\] of, bound by
tradition'.4 The origins of the theories are what make them cohere as
traditional theories of IR and include realism (neorealism and critical
realism); the English School; and liberal theories (liberalism,
neoliberalism, global governance and cosmopolitanism). These are
theories that often dwell on ancient and classical writings from
Aristotle to Voltaire, and are sometimes committed to (re)interpreting
these writings as though they were written for this contemporary age.
They are also traditional because they possess the force of law where,
for instance, the 'realist gambit'5 has been dominant as well as the
(neo)liberal 'common-sense'.6

Theories considered to be critical include feminism, post-structuralism,
securitisation and postcolonialism, among others. The question then is:
what makes them 'critical'? As Steven Roach asserts, 'what makes
critical IR theory "critical" is its self-awareness as a theory'---an
awareness woven into the critical traditions of Kant, Hegel, Marx,
Habermas, Derrida and Butler7---and we can certainly add Michel Foucault
among other post-Enlightenment French philosophers. It is argued that
critical theory was introduced into IR in 1981 with the publication of
Robert Cox's Social Forces, States and World Orders and Richard K
Ashley's Political Realism and Human Interests.8 A discussion of the
so-called 'great debates' will show that critical theorists are
generally post- positivist and to a large extent anti-foundationalist in
that they do not accept any objective, Archimedean point or standard by
which 'legitimate' knowledge should be measured. And they are also
postmodern in the sense that they oppose the teleological measurement of
human progress that characterises Enlightenment thinking, in addition to
their quest to deconstruct established interpretations (discourse) in
order to ascertain their embedded 'silences'. It is based on this common
ontological and epistemological orientation that neo- Gramscian theory
and deconstructionism manage to fit under critical IR theory.

The problem, however, is that [[couching]{.mark} the broader field
[into]{.mark} two [binaries]{.mark}--- what Cox]{.underline} in 1981
[classified as problem-solving and critical theory]{.underline},
respectively[---[is **a problematic simplification**]{.mark} of the
discussion of i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations.
Although many people will agree that there is no pure form of these two
main schools, some IR textbooks, course syllabuses and journal articles
perpetuate this trend.9 [[This]{.mark} configuration of the field
[inhibits the **multidimensional** nature]{.mark} of the subject matter.
In an attempt [to reconcile the binary]{.mark} between
problem-solving]{.underline} (rationalist) [theories and
critical]{.underline} (interpretivist) [theory, [this]{.mark}
paper]{.underline} also [tries to construct]{.underline} what can be
considered [a ['third way']{.mark} in IR theorising for those who seek
to transcend what is usually characteristic of either of these
theoretical traditions]{.underline}. The crux of the entire paper is to
explain why the contention here is to adopt a 'third way' (what I refer
to as 'praxeological deconstructionism'10) as opposed to the rationalist
and reflectivist/interpretivist schools in IR theory. [The quest [is to
make the discipline **practically relevant in explaining the 'here and
now' while not abandoning the need to be critical and
self-reflexive**]{.mark} **in its theorising**]{.underline}. Overall the
paper initiates a purposive call for the dual goal of deconstruction and
reconstruction, a normative and instrumental position that the 'thick
descriptions' of most critical theorists (particularly those belonging
to the 'post-' approaches) often fail to emphasise.11

### AT: Policy Failure

#### Reversing [policy failure]{.underline} does [NOT require methodological consistency]{.underline}, merely [causal policy relevance]{.underline} -- [ALT makes it worse]{.underline} through [theoretical reification]{.underline} and [alienating policymakers]{.underline}

\--reification = confusing deliberately oversimplified theory with the
complex reality it attempts to describe

[There are]{.underline}, of course, some [nuts-and-bolts issues that
scholars should be mindful of if they want to participate in the broader
policy debate]{.underline}. Since policymakers have short attention
spans given the number and breadth of issues they have to deal with,
scholarly efforts to engage them need to be brief in conveying their
ideas.70 This explains why Op/Eds are particularly influential and why
so many are optimistic that blogs could play a similar role. Moreover,
[[**policymakers** find much]{.mark} current [scholarly
work]{.mark}---from **across the methodological
spectrum**---**[inaccessible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The common
sentiment animating their views is that [scholars [should **cut the
jargon**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Policymakers don't want scholars to
write in Greek or French]{.underline}, but rather just plain English.71

There are also some much bigger issues undergirding the relevance
question.72 To begin with, [political science needs to **rethink how it
balances**]{.underline} scholarly [**rigor with practical application**.
There is a]{.underline} **[middle ground]{.underline}** [between policy
analysis and journalism]{.underline}, on one side, [and]{.underline}
**[scholastic irrelevance]{.underline}** on the other.73
[[The]{.underline} **[best approach]{.underline}**]{.mark} to balancing
scholarly rigor with continuing policy relevance
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [**methodological pluralism**, which includes
a commitment to [using **not any particular
method**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([or]{.underline} **[all of
them]{.underline}**) [**[but]{.mark}** rather just [the approach most
**appropriate for the question**]{.mark} **at hand**]{.underline}. But
methodological pluralism, by itself, is not sufficient. The latest trend
in political science requiring the simultaneous use of multiple methods
could, ironically, prove to be even more limiting of policy relevance.
Indeed, given the need to employ all of these methods simultaneously, it
is potentially even more constraining in terms of the problems it can
address because it has to be limited to those which can be quantified,
modeled, and studied in depth at the same time.74 Therefore,
**[reinforcing]{.underline}** [methodological pluralism must also be
[a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[commitment to problem-, rather than method-,
driven research]{.mark} agendas**. It is only the
**combination**]{.underline} [of these]{.underline} two [principles that
[will ensure]{.mark} that [**policy-relevant security studies**
can]{.mark}]{.underline} not only **[[survive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
but thrive, in political science.75

[Scholars also need to think carefully about the role of theory in
policy-relevant **security studies** scholarship]{.underline}.
[[While]{.mark} there is no doubt that [theory is important]{.mark} to
policymakers, scholars need to be aware that as with many other things,
**[too much]{.mark}**]{.underline} of it [[can be]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[bad]{.underline}]{.mark}** thing. [In particular, the [effort to
**cram the rich complexity of the social world into universal
models**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[can do **intellectual violence to the
phenomenon under study**]{.underline} [as well as produce **suboptimal
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Paul Nitze, then the director of the
Secretary of State's Policy Planning Staff, readily conceded
policymakers' need for theory but also noted that "there is the opposing
consideration .. . that [\[theoretical\] **oversimplification** presents
**great dangers**]{.underline}."76 Albert Wohlstetter advocated a
balanced approach to theory, noting that the key to his success
throughout his career "was the practical experience I had in working
with engineers. I worked with them from two sides, so to speak, as
someone who had been concerned with very abstract theory more basic than
that familiar to design engineers, but on the other hand, I was also
concerned with production, and therefore generally trying to get them to
do things more practical than they wanted to do."77 [Theory is a
powerful]{.underline} **[tool]{.underline}** of statecraft, [but when
scholars embrace universal models they also]{.underline} **[[risk
irrelevance or worse]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Likewise, the **[transmission belts conveying scholarly findings to the
policy world must be repaired]{.underline}**. Kennan envisioned the
State Department's Policy Planning Staff in the late 1940s serving this
function, and in some respects it continues to do so to this day.78
However, there are limits to how effectively a part of the bureaucracy
can serve as an honest research broker. A plethora of think tanks in
Washington are also supposed to translate knowledge into action, though
the trend in recent years has been toward the establishment of overtly
political and advocacy organizations, rather than nonpartisan,
translational research centers.79 Reinventing the role of think tanks as
bridges between the Ivory Tower and the beltway is long overdue.

[While nonacademic transmission belts can mediate between the Ivory
Tower and the Beltway, they are]{.underline} [**[no substitute for the
scholars who produce knowledge to]{.mark} themselves [serve as their own
translators]{.mark} of it [into policy]{.mark}**. To be sure, scholars
should not stop writing scholarly books and monographs]{.underline}
utilizing the most sophisticated techniques of their discipline, if
appropriate. In addition to doing these things, [scholars
should]{.underline} **[address]{.underline}** pressing **[real world
problems, not just chase after disciplinary fads]{.underline}**. **[No
one]{.underline}** [is in a better position to highlight the policy
implications of a given piece of research than the individual who
conducted it]{.underline}. [Academic social scientists, **if they want
to be heard by senior policymakers**, and heard correctly, **need to be
their own policy "transmission belts**]{.underline}."80

[[The role of]{.mark} the **[D]{.mark}**emocratic **[P]{.mark}**eace
**[T]{.mark}**heory [in]{.mark} the recent **[Iraq]{.mark} war**
[demonstrates]{.mark} the problems with scholars not specifying the
concrete policy implications of their research]{.underline}.81 [Drawing

the]{.underline} George W. [**Bush** administration **justified**
the]{.underline} [**invasion of Iraq** as part of a larger strategy to

[Democratic Peace proponent Bruce Russett]{.underline} [**objected** to

[Over the past decade, the "**cult of irrelevance**" in political
science scholarship has been lamented by a growing chorus]{.underline}
(Putnam 2003; Nye 2009; Walt 2009). [Prominent scholars]{.underline} of
international affairs [have diagnosed]{.underline} the roots of [the
gap]{.underline} between academia and policymaking, [made the case for
why political science research is valuable for
policymaking]{.underline}, [and offered]{.underline} a number of
[ideas]{.underline} for enhancing the policy relevance of scholarship in
international relations and comparative politics (Walt 2005,2011; Mead
2010; Van Evera 2010; Jentleson and Ratner 2011; Gallucci 2012; Avey and
Desch 2014). Building on these insights, [several initiatives have been
formed]{.underline} in the attempt to "bridge the gap."2
[Many]{.underline} of the specific efforts put in place by these
projects [focus on providing scholars with the skills, platforms, and
networks to better communicate]{.underline} the [findings and
implications]{.underline} of their research [to the policymaking
community]{.underline}, a necessary and worthwhile objective for a field
in which theoretical debates, methodological training, and publishing
norms tend more and more toward the abstract and esoteric.

[Yet enhancing communication]{.underline} between scholars and
policymakers [is only one component]{.underline} of bridging the gap
between international affairs theory and practice. [Another]{.underline}
crucial component of this bridge [is the **generation of substantive
research programs that are actually policy relevant**]{.underline}---a
challenge to which less concerted attention has been paid. The dual
challenges of bridging the gap are especially acute for graduate
students, a particular irony since many enter the discipline with the
explicit hope of informing policy. [In a field that has an admirable
devotion to pedagogical self-reflection]{.underline}, **[strikingly
little attention is paid to techniques for generating policy-relevant
ideas]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} dissertation and other [research
topics]{.underline}. Although numerous articles and conference workshops
are devoted to the importance of experiential and problem-based
learning, especially through techniques of simulation that emulate
policymaking processes (Loggins 2009; Butcher 2012; Glasgow 2012;
Rothman 2012; DiCicco 2014), little has been written about the use of
such techniques for generating and developing innovative research ideas.

[This article outlines an experiential and problem-based approach
to]{.underline} developing a [political science research]{.underline}
program [using scenario analysis]{.underline}. It focuses especially on
illuminating the research generation and pedagogical benefits of this
technique by describing the use of scenarios in the annual New Era
Foreign Policy Conference (NEFPC), which brings together doctoral
students of international and comparative affairs who share a
demonstrated interest in policy-relevant scholarship.3 In the
introductory section, the article outlines the practice of scenario
analysis and considers the utility of the technique in political
science. We argue that scenario analysis should be viewed as a tool to
stimulate problem-based learning for doctoral students and discuss the
broader scholarly benefits of using scenarios to help generate research
ideas. The second section details the manner in which NEFPC deploys
scenario analysis. The third section reflects upon some of the concrete
scholarly benefits that have been realized from the scenario format. The
fourth section offers insights on the pedagogical potential associated
with using scenarios in the classroom across levels of study. A brief
conclusion reflects on the importance of developing specific techniques
to aid those who wish to generate political science scholarship of
relevance to the policy world.

What Are Scenarios and Why Use Them in Political Science?

[Scenario analysis]{.underline} is perceived most commonly as a
technique for examining the robustness of strategy. It [can immerse
decision makers in future states that go beyond conventional
extrapolations of current trends]{.underline}, [preparing them to take
advantage of unexpected opportunities and to protect themselves from
adverse exogenous shocks]{.underline}. The global petroleum company
Shell, a pioneer of the technique, characterizes scenario analysis as
the art of considering "what if" questions about possible future worlds.
[[Scenario analysis is]{.mark} thus **[typically seen as serving]{.mark}
the purposes of [corporate planning or]{.mark} as a [policy]{.mark}
tool**]{.underline} to be used in combination with simulations of
decision making. **[[Yet]{.mark} scenario analysis [is not inherently
limited to these uses]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This section]{.underline}
provides a brief overview of the practice of scenario analysis and the
motivations underpinning its uses. It then [makes a case for the utility
of the technique for political science scholarship]{.underline} and
describes how the scenarios deployed at NEFPC were created.

The Art of Scenario Analysis

[We characterize scenario analysis as the art of juxtaposing current
trends in unexpected combinations in order [to **articulate surprising
and yet plausible futures**]{.mark}]{.underline}, often **[referred to
as "[alternative worlds]{.mark}."]{.underline}** [Scenarios
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} thus **[[explicitly not forecasts or
projections based on linear extrapolations]{.mark} of contemporary
patterns]{.underline}**, [and they are **[not hypothesis-based expert
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Nor]{.mark} should they be
equated with [simulations]{.mark}**, which are]{.underline} best
characterized as [functional representations of **real institutions** or
decision-making processes]{.underline} (Asal 2005). **[[Instead]{.mark},
they are [depictions of possible future states of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, offered **[[together with]{.mark} a
narrative of the [driving causal forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
potential exogenous shocks **[[that could lead to those
futures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Good scenarios thus rely on explicit
causal propositions that, independent of one another, are
plausible---yet, when combined, suggest surprising and sometimes
controversial future worlds. For example, few predicted the dramatic
fall in oil prices toward the end of 2014. Yet independent driving
forces, such as the shale gas revolution in the United States, China's
slowing economic growth, and declining conflict in major Middle Eastern
oil producers such as Libya, were all recognized secular trends
that---combined with OPEC's decision not to take concerted action as
prices began to decline---came together in an unexpected way.

While scenario analysis played a role in war gaming and strategic
planning during the Cold War, the real antecedents of the contemporary
practice are found in corporate futures studies of the late 1960s and
early 1970s (Raskin et al. 2005). Scenario analysis was essentially
initiated at Royal Dutch Shell in 1965, with the realization that the
usual forecasting techniques and models were not capturing the rapidly
changing environment in which the company operated (Wack 1985; Schwartz
1991). In particular, it had become evident that straight-line
extrapolations of past global trends were inadequate for anticipating
the evolving business environment. Shell-style scenario planning "helped
break the habit, ingrained in most corporate planning, of assuming that
the future will look much like the present" (Wilkinson and Kupers 2013,
4). Using scenario thinking, Shell anticipated the possibility of two
Arab-induced oil shocks in the 1970s and hence was able to position
itself for major disruptions in the global petroleum sector.

Building on its corporate roots, scenario analysis has become a standard
policymaking tool. For example, the Project on Forward Engagement
advocates linking systematic foresight, which it defines as the
disciplined analysis of alternative futures, to planning and feedback
loops to better equip the United States to meet contemporary governance
challenges (Fuerth 2011). Another prominent application of scenario
thinking is found in the National Intelligence Council's series of
Global Trends reports, issued every four years to aid policymakers in
anticipating and planning for future challenges. These reports present a
handful of "alternative worlds" approximately twenty years into the
future, carefully constructed on the basis of emerging global trends,
risks, and opportunities, and intended to stimulate thinking about
geopolitical change and its effects.4 As with corporate scenario
analysis, the technique can be used in foreign policymaking for
long-range general planning purposes as well as for anticipating and
coping with more narrow and immediate challenges. An example of the
latter is the German Marshall Fund's EuroFutures project, which uses
four scenarios to map the potential consequences of the Euro-area
financial crisis (German Marshall Fund 2013).

[Several features [make **scenario analysis particularly
useful**]{.mark} for policymaking]{.underline}.5 [Long-term global
trends across a number of different realms]{.underline}---social,
technological, environmental, economic, and political---[combine in
often-unexpected ways to produce unforeseen challenges]{.underline}.
[Yet the [ability]{.mark} of decision makers [to **imagine**, let alone
prepare for, discontinuities]{.mark}]{.underline} in the policy realm
[[is **constrained** by]{.mark} their [existing mental models and
maps]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This limitation is exacerbated by
**[well-known cognitive bias tendencies such as groupthink and
confirmation bias]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Jervis 1976; Janis 1982;
Tetlock 2005). [The power of [scenarios]{.mark} lies in their ability to
[help individuals **break out of conventional modes of
thinking**]{.mark} and analysis by introducing unusual combinations of
trends and deliberate discontinuities in narratives about the
future]{.underline}. **[[Imagining alternative future worlds through a
structured analytical process enables policymakers to envision and
thereby adapt to something altogether different from the known
present]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Designing Scenarios for Political Science Inquiry

The characteristics of scenario analysis that commend its use to
policymakers also make it well suited to helping political scientists
generate and develop policy-relevant research programs. [Scenarios are
essentially textured, plausible, and relevant stories that help us
imagine how the future]{.underline} political-economic world [could be
different from the past]{.underline} in a manner that highlights policy
challenges and opportunities. For example, terrorist organizations are a
known threat that have captured the attention of the policy community,
yet our responses to them tend to be linear and reactive. Scenarios that
explore how seemingly unrelated vectors of change---the rise of a new
peer competitor in the East that diverts strategic attention, volatile
commodity prices that empower and disempower various state and nonstate
actors in surprising ways, and the destabilizing effects of climate
change or infectious disease pandemics---can be useful for illuminating
the nature and limits of the terrorist threat in ways that may be missed
by a narrower focus on recognized states and groups. By illuminating the
potential strategic significance of specific and yet poorly understood
opportunities and threats, scenario analysis helps to identify crucial
gaps in our collective understanding of global politicaleconomic trends
and dynamics. The notion of "exogeneity"---so prevalent in social
science scholarship---applies to models of reality, not to reality
itself. [Very simply, scenario analysis can throw into sharp relief
often-overlooked yet pressing questions in international affairs that
demand focused investigation]{.underline}.

[Scenarios thus offer]{.underline}, in principle, [an innovative tool
for developing a political science research agenda]{.underline}. In
practice, [achieving this objective requires careful tailoring of the
approach]{.underline}. The specific scenario analysis technique we
outline below was designed and refined to provide a structured
experiential process for generating problem-based research questions
with contemporary international policy relevance.6 The first step in the
process of creating the scenario set described here was to identify
important causal forces in contemporary global affairs. Consensus was
not the goal; on the contrary, some of these causal statements
represented competing theories about global change (e.g., a resurgence
of the nation-state vs. border-evading globalizing forces). A major
principle underpinning the transformation of these causal drivers into
possible future worlds was to "simplify, then exaggerate" them, before
fleshing out the emerging story with more details.7 Thus, the contours
of the future world were drawn first in the scenario, with details about
the possible pathways to that point filled in second. It is entirely
possible, indeed probable, that some of the causal claims that turned
into parts of scenarios were exaggerated so much as to be implausible,
and that an unavoidable degree of bias or our own form of groupthink
went into construction of the scenarios. One of the great strengths of
scenario analysis, however, is that the scenario discussions themselves,
as described below, lay bare these especially implausible claims and
systematic biases.8

An explicit methodological approach underlies the written scenarios
themselves as well as the analytical process around them---that of
case-centered, structured, focused comparison, intended especially to
shed light on new causal mechanisms (George and Bennett 2005). [The use
of scenarios is similar to counterfactual analysis in that it modifies
certain variables in a given situation in order to analyze the resulting
effects]{.underline} (Fearon 1991). [Whereas counterfactuals are
traditionally retrospective]{.underline} in nature and explore events
that did not actually occur in the context of known history, our
**[scenarios are deliberately forward-looking]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} are [designed to **explore potential
futures**]{.underline} that could unfold. As such, counterfactual
analysis is especially well suited to identifying how individual events
might expand or shift the "funnel of choices" available to political
actors and thus lead to different historical outcomes (Nye 2005,
68--69), while forward-looking scenario analysis can better illuminate
surprising intersections and sociopolitical dynamics without the
perceptual constraints imposed by fine-grained historical knowledge. [We
see scenarios as a complementary resource for exploring these dynamics
in international affairs, rather than as a replacement]{.underline} for
counterfactual analysis, historical case studies, or other
methodological tools.

In the scenario process developed for NEFPC, three distinct scenarios
are employed, acting as cases for analytical comparison. Each scenario,
as detailed below, includes a set of explicit "driving forces" which
represent hypotheses about causal mechanisms worth investigating in
evolving international affairs. The scenario analysis process itself
employs templates (discussed further below) to serve as a graphical
representation of a structured, focused investigation and thereby as the
research tool for conducting case-centered comparative analysis (George
and Bennett 2005). In essence, these templates articulate key observable
implications within the alternative worlds of the scenarios and serve as
a framework for capturing the data that emerge (King, Keohane, and Verba
1994). Finally, this structured, focused comparison serves as the basis
for the cross-case session emerging from the scenario analysis that
leads directly to the articulation of new research agendas.

[The scenario process described here has thus been carefully designed to
offer some guidance to policy-oriented]{.underline} graduate [students
who are otherwise left to the relatively unstructured norms by which
political science]{.underline} dissertation [ideas are typically
developed]{.underline}. The initial articulation of a dissertation
project is generally an idiosyncratic and personal undertaking (Useem
1997; Rothman 2008), whereby students might choose topics based on their
coursework, their own previous policy exposure, or the topics studied by
their advisors. Research agendas are thus typically developed by looking
for "puzzles" in existing research programs (Kuhn 1996). Doctoral
students also, understandably, often choose topics that are particularly
amenable to garnering research funding. Conventional grant programs
typically base their funding priorities on extrapolations from what has
been important in the recent past---leading to, for example, the
prevalence of Japan and Soviet studies in the mid-1980s or terrorism
studies in the 2000s---in the absence of any alternative method for
identifying questions of likely future significance.

[The scenario approach to generating research ideas is grounded in the
belief that these traditional approaches can be complemented by
identifying questions likely to be of **great empirical importance** in
the real world, even if these **do not appear**]{.underline} as puzzles
[**in existing research programs** or as clear extrapolations from past
events]{.underline}. The [scenarios]{.underline} analyzed at NEFPC
[envision alternative worlds that could develop in the medium (five to
seven year) term and are designed to **tease out issues scholars and
policymakers may encounter in the relatively near future**]{.underline}
[so that they can **begin thinking critically about them
now**]{.underline}. [This timeframe offers a period distant enough from
the present as to avoid falling into current events analysis, but not so
far into the future as to seem like science fiction]{.underline}. In
imagining the worlds in which these scenarios might come to pass,
[[participants **learn strategies for avoiding failures of creativity**
and for **overturning the assumptions that prevent scholars and analysts
from anticipating and understanding**]{.mark} the pivotal junctures that
arise in international affairs]{.underline}.

The most extreme type of risk is the risk of a global catastrophe
causing permanent worldwide destruction to human civilization. In the
most extreme cases, human extinction could occur. Global catastrophic
risk (GCR) is thus risk of events of the highest magnitude of
consequences, and the risks merit serious attention even if the
probabilities of such events are low. Indeed, a growing chorus of
scholars rates GCR reduction as among the most important priorities for
society today. Unfortunately, many analysts also estimate frighteningly
high probabilities of global catastrophe, with one even stating "I think
the odds are no better than fifty-fifty that our present civilization on
Earth will survive to the end of the present century" (Rees 2003:8).

Regardless of what the probabilities are, it is clear that humanity
today faces a variety of serious GCRs. To an extent, humanity always has
faced GCRs, in the form of supervolcano eruptions, impacts from large
asteroids and comets, and remnants of stellar explosions. Events like
these have contributed to several mass extinction events across Earth's
history. The Toba volcano eruption about 70,000 years ago may have come
close to bringing the human species to a premature end. However,
[**[scholars]{.mark}** of GCR [generally believe]{.mark} that today's
**[greatest risks]{.mark}** derive from human activity. These GCRs
[include **war** with **bio**]{.mark}logical [or **nuc**]{.mark}**lear**
**[weapons]{.mark}**, extreme **climate change** and other
**environmental threats**, [and **misuse** or **accidents**
involving]{.mark} powerful **[emerging tech]{.mark}**nologies [like
**a**]{.mark}**rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[syn]{.mark}thetic
[bio]{.mark}logy]{.underline}**. These GCRs threaten far greater
destruction than was seen in the World Wars, the 1918 flu, the Black
Death plague, or other major catastrophes of recent memory.

[The **high stakes** and **urgent threats** of GCR **demand** careful
**analysis** of the **risks** and the opportunities for addressing
them]{.underline}. However, several factors make GCR difficult to
analyze. One factor is the unprecedented nature of global catastrophes.
Many of the catastrophes have never occurred in any form, and of course
no previous global catastrophe has ever destroyed modern human
civilization. The lack of precedent means that analysts cannot rely on
historical data as much as they can for smaller, more frequent events.
Another factor is the complexity of GCRs, involving global economic,
political, and industrial systems, which present difficult analytical
decisions about which details to include. Finally, the high stakes of
GCR pose difficult dilemmas about the extent to which GCR reduction
should be prioritized relative to other issues.

In this paper we present an overview of contemporary GCR scholarship and
related issues for risk analysis and risk management. We focus less on
the risks themselves, each of which merits its own dedicated treatment.
Other references are recommended for the risks, perhaps the best of
which are the relevant chapters of Bostrom and Ćirković (2008). Instead,
our focus here is on overarching themes of importance to the breadth of
the GCRs. The following section defines GCR in more detail and explains
why many researchers consider it to be so important. Next, some of the
analytical challenges that GCR poses and the techniques that have been
developed to meet these challenges are explained. There follows a
discussion of some dilemmas that arise when GCR reduction would require
great sacrifice or would interfere with each other. Finally, conclusions
are drawn.

2\. What Is GCR And Why Is It Important?

[Taken **literally**, a global catastrophe can be any event that is in
some way catastrophic across the globe]{.underline}. [This suggests a
rather low threshold]{.underline} for what counts as a global
catastrophe. An event causing just one death on each continent (say,
from a jet-setting assassin) could rate as a global catastrophe, because
surely these deaths would be catastrophic for the deceased and their
loved ones. [However, in common usage, a global catastrophe would be
**catastrophic** for a significant portion of the globe]{.underline}.
Minimum thresholds have variously been set around ten thousand to ten
million deaths or \$10 billion to \$10 trillion in damages (Bostrom and
Ćirković 2008), or death of one quarter of the human population
(Atkinson 1999; Hempsell 2004). [Others have emphasized catastrophes
that cause **long-term declines in the trajectory of human
civilization**]{.underline} (Beckstead 2013), [that human civilization
**does not recover from**]{.underline} (Maher and Baum 2013), [that
drastically reduce humanity's potential for future
achievements]{.underline} ([Bostrom]{.underline} 2002, [using the term
"**existential risk**"), or that result in **human
extinction**]{.underline} (Matheny 2007; Posner 2004).

[A common theme across all these treatments of GCR is that **[some
catastrophes are]{.mark} vastly [more important]{.mark} than
others**]{.underline}. Carl Sagan was perhaps the first to recognize
this, in his commentary on nuclear winter (Sagan 1983). [Without nuclear
winter, a global nuclear war might kill several hundred million people.
This is obviously a major catastrophe, but humanity would presumably
carry on. However, with **nuclear winter**]{.underline}, per Sagan,
[**humanity could go extinct**. The loss would be not just an additional
four billion or so deaths, but the [loss of **all future
generations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} To paraphrase Sagan, [the
loss would be billions and billions of lives, or even
**more**]{.underline}. [Sagan estimated **[500 trillion lives]{.mark}**,
assuming humanity would continue for ten million more years, which he
cited as typical for a successful species.]{.underline}

[Sagan's 500 trillion number may even be [an
**underestimate**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The analysis here takes an
adventurous turn, hinging on the evolution of the human species and the
long-term fate of the universe. On these long time scales, the
descendants of contemporary humans may no longer be recognizably
"human". The issue then is whether the descendants are still worth
caring about, whatever they are. If they are, then it begs the question
of how many of them there will be. Barring major global catastrophe,
Earth will remain habitable for about one billion more years 2 until the
Sun gets too warm and large. The rest of the Solar System, Milky Way
galaxy, universe, and (if it exists) the multiverse will remain
habitable for a lot longer than that (Adams and Laughlin 1997), should
our descendants gain the capacity to migrate there. [An open question in
astronomy is whether it is possible for the descendants of humanity to
continue living for an **infinite length of time** or instead merely an
**astronomically large but finite** length of time]{.underline} (see
e.g. Ćirković 2002; Kaku 2005). Either way, [the stakes with global
catastrophes **could** be **much larger than the loss of 500 trillion
lives**]{.underline}.

[**[Debates]{.mark}** about the infinite vs. the merely astronomical are
of theoretical interest]{.underline} (Ng 1991; Bossert et al. 2007),
[but they have **limited practical significance**. This can be seen when
**evaluating GCRs from a standard
risk-equals-probability-times-magnitude framework**. Using Sagan's 500
trillion lives estimate, it follows that reducing the probability of
global catastrophe by a mere one-in-500-trillion chance is of the same
significance as saving one human life. Phrased differently, society
[should **try 500 trillion times harder to prevent**]{.mark} **a [global
catastrophe]{.mark} [than]{.mark} it should to [save a person's
life]{.mark}**. Or, preventing one million deaths is equivalent to a
one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of global catastrophe.
This suggests society should **make extremely large investment in GCR
reduction, at the expense of virtually all other
objectives**]{.underline}.

Judge and legal scholar Richard Posner made a similar point in monetary
terms (Posner 2004). Posner used \$50,000 as the value of a statistical
human life (VSL) and 12 billion humans as the total loss of life (double
the 2004 world population); he describes both figures as significant
underestimates. Multiplying them gives \$600 trillion as an
underestimate of the value of preventing global catastrophe. For
comparison, the United States government typically uses a VSL of around
one to ten million dollars (Robinson 2007). Multiplying a \$10 million
VSL with 500 trillion lives gives \$5x1021 as the value of preventing
global catastrophe. But even using "just\" \$600 trillion, [society
should be willing to spend]{.underline} at least that much to prevent a
global catastrophe, which converts to being willing to spend at least
[\$1 million for a one-in-500-million reduction in the probability of
global catastrophe]{.underline}. Thus [while reasonable disagreement
exists on how large of a VSL to use and how much to count future
generations, even low-end positions suggest **vast resource
allocations** should be redirected to reducing GCR. This conclusion is
only **strengthened** when considering the **astronomical size of the
stakes**]{.underline}, but the same point holds either way. The bottom
line is that, [as long as something along the lines of the standard
riskequals-probability-times-magnitude framework is being used, then
**even tiny GCR reductions** merit significant effort. This point holds
especially strongly for risks of catastrophes that would cause
**permanent harm to global human civilization**]{.underline}.

[The discussion thus far has assumed that all human lives are valued
equally. This assumption is **not universally held**]{.underline}.
[People often value some people more than others]{.underline}, favoring
themselves, their family and friends, their compatriots, their
generation, or others whom they identify with. [Great debates rage on
across moral philosophy, economics, and other fields about how much
people should value others]{.underline} who are distant in space, time,
or social relation, as well as the unborn members of future generations.
[This debate is crucial]{.underline} for all valuations of risk,
including GCR. Indeed, if each of us only cares about our immediate
selves, then global catastrophes may not be especially important, and we
probably have better things to do with our time than worry about them.

[While everyone has the right to their **own views and
feelings**]{.underline}, we find that [the strongest arguments are for
the **widely held position** that **all human lives should be valued
equally**.]{.underline} This position is succinctly stated in the United
States Declaration of Independence, updated in the 1848 Declaration of
Sentiments: "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and 3
women are created equal". [Philosophers speak of [a]{.mark}n
agent-neutral, objective "**[view from nowhere]{.mark}**"]{.underline}
(Nagel 1986) [or a "veil of ignorance"]{.underline} (Rawls 1971) [in
which each person considers what is best for society **irrespective of
which member of society they happen to be**]{.underline}. [Such a
perspective **suggests [valuing everyone equally]{.mark}**, regardless
of who they are or where or when they live. This in turn [suggests a
**very high value for reducing GCR**]{.mark}, or a high degree of
priority for GCR reduction efforts.]{.underline}

### Consequentialism Good

#### Evaluate [causal consequences]{.underline} -- [subsumes]{.underline} the effects of [representations]{.underline} -- BUT conflating "causes" with "justifies" is [ethically bankrupt]{.underline}

**Fairclough and Fairclough 18**---emeritus Professor of Linguistics at
Lancaster University AND School of Humanities and Social Sciences,
University of Central Lancashire (Norman and Isabela, "A procedural
approach to ethical critique in CDA," Critical Discourse Studies Volume
15, 2018 - Issue 2, 169-185, dml) \[CDA=critical discourse analysis\]

The term 'discourse ethics' is Habermas's (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
30-34), but we are using it here in a general sense: for the view that
[[a]{.mark}n **adequate [framework for ethical evaluation]{.mark}** and
**critique [must include]{.mark} the comparison** and **evaluation of
different arguments for different lines of action** in a process of
deliberation]{.underline}. Such assessments of arguments pose difficult
problems, and deliberation is by no means guaranteed to produce
consensus. Nevertheless, [deliberation can **contribute to the quality
of ethical critique** by ensuring that a **wide range of arguments are
considered** in making decisions, that all alternatives are **taken into
account** and **thoroughly criticized**, and that people have to (at
least) **moderate their own partialities** in evaluating a range of
arguments collectively]{.underline}. To illustrate this, we shall refer
to two ethically contentious political decisions and the courses of
action which they led to. The first is the decision by the British Prime
Minister Tony Blair to advocate Britain's participation in the invasion
of Iraq in 2003 (we have discussed this in Fairclough & Fairclough 2012:
96-97). The second is the decision by the German Chancellor Angela
Merkel to open Germany's borders to the refugees coming from the Middle
East in the autumn of 2015. In so doing, we will illustrate the
relevance of ethical critique from all three of the major ethical
positions: deontological, consequentialist and virtue ethics. CDA and
practical argumentation CDA is mainly concerned with [critical analysis
of discourse]{.underline} which [is **oriented to action**]{.underline},
including political discourse, but also managerial, organisational and
other forms of discourse. [The **primary activity** in such discourse is
**practical [argumentation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, argumentation over
action, [[over **what is to be done**]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g.
**[[what policies should be adopted]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [Practical
argumentation should]{.underline} accordingly [be the **primary
analytical focus**]{.underline} in CDA (Fairclough & Fairclough 2012).
[This **[does not exclude]{.mark} other**]{.underline} familiar **[forms
of analysis]{.underline}** ([such as **[analysing
rep]{.mark}resentation[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[but **subsumes
them**]{.mark}. The point of]{.underline} representing (or
['framing']{.underline}) [an issue in a particular way is to **create
particular public attitudes** and **opinions**, and thus **legitimize**
or **facilitate a particular course of action**.]{.underline} Critique
of discourse is the focal concern for CDA, but critique of discourse is
by no means exclusive to CDA. On the contrary, [critique of
discourse]{.underline} is a normal part of all discourse. It [is a
**normal part of everyday practical argumentation**: people **find
reasons in favour** and **against proposals for action**, they
**consider alternatives**, **adopt them** or **discard them**, and so
on. A course of action **worthy of being adopted** is **one that has
withstood criticism**. Agents [may]{.mark} decide to [discard]{.mark}
proposals [either because]{.mark} they are **likely to be
[instrumentally inadequate]{.mark}** in relation to the goals they are
supposed to achieve, [or]{.mark} because they find them **[ethically
problematic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, for example because the values or
goals they are motivated by are unacceptable. Ethical critique is a
concern for CDA at three levels: as an aspect of agents' reasoning, for
example as an aspect of politicians' deliberation over what policy to
adopt; as an aspect of the normative critique of those deliberative
practices which CDA carries out; as an aspect of the critique that CDA
itself is open to. There are therefore three main places where ethical
values come into the picture: what values are arguers (e.g. politicians)
arguing from? what are the values that CDA analysts are espousing, from
the perspective of which they are evaluating the arguments of those
arguers? what are the values of other critics (including critics of
CDA)? [CDA]{.underline} is itself a form of discourse, which is
specialized for academic critique of social actions, events, practices
and structures, with a focus on discourse. It [can itself be viewed as a
**form of practical argumentation**]{.underline} (Fairclough 2013),
[open to the **same critical questions** that it directs at the
discourse it subjects to critique]{.underline}. CDA practitioners are
bound by an obligation to address ethical evaluations that are critical
of their work. Moreover, [the ethical judgement which is part of the
normative critique carried out]{.underline} in CDA [**does not come out
of thin air**, but is built upon elements drawn selectively from ethical
judgement and critique in public discourse]{.underline}. And CDA needs
to rethink its own critique in response to shifts in public discourse
and political reality, such as the emergence of controversy over
'political correctness' (Fairclough 2003). We have argued that [the
**primary focus** of critical analysis]{.underline} in CDA [should be
**practical argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline}
(Fairclough & Fairclough 2012). This was based upon a claim about the
character of political discourse, which we saw as [primarily concerned
with the question of **what is to be done**]{.underline}. [Deliberation
is an abstract genre in which **(alternative) proposals are being
tested**. The **framework**]{.underline} for critical analysis [of
**practical argumentation** and **deliberation**]{.underline} which we
have developed since 2012 [provides]{.underline} CDA with [an
**effective way of evaluating** and **critiquing discourse** from an
**ethical point of view**]{.underline}. One of its strengths is that [it
allows **different approaches** to thinking about ethical
questions]{.underline} (deontological, consequentialist and virtue
ethics) [to be combined within an **ethical deliberative procedure for
achieving impartiality**]{.underline}. In a more recent version of this
framework (Fairclough, I. 2016, 2018), [deliberation is modelled as a
critical procedure designed to **filter out those practical
conclusions**]{.underline} (and corresponding decisions) [that **would
not pass the test of critical questioning**]{.underline}. Two distinct
argument schemes are involved in deliberative activity types: an
argument from goals, circumstances and meansgoal relations, and an
argument from (negative or positive) consequences. [Proposals are
**tentatively supported** by **practical arguments from goals**, and are
**[tested in]{.mark} the [light of]{.mark} their [potential
consequences]{.mark}**, via **practical arguments from
consequence**]{.underline}. Goals are generated by various sources of
normativity, and these can be what conventionally is called 'values',
but can also be obligations, rights and duties. [Critical questioning
seeks to **expose potential negative consequences** of proposals and
thus evaluate them in terms of their **acceptability** or
**reasonableness**: if the consequences are **on balance unacceptable**
for those affected, then it would be **more reasonable not to engage in
the proposed course of action**. [Unacceptable consequences are
**critical objections** which]{.mark} can **conclusively [rebut a
proposal]{.mark}**. Where two or more proposals survive critical
testing, one may be **chosen as the better proposal** on nonarbitrary
grounds]{.underline} (e.g. being simpler to enact). In our view, [the
**most significant perspective** in the light of which proposals are to
be tested is a **consequentialist** one]{.underline} (Fairclough &
Fairclough 2012, Fairclough, I. 2016). The term 'consequence' is however
used here broadly to refer to several types of states-of-affairs: the
goals of the proposed action (the intended consequences); the potential
unintended consequences (or risks) involved; various known and
predictable impacts, including impacts on institutional, social facts.
[[If]{.mark} a proposal is [**likely to result in a situation** that
is]{.mark}]{.underline} illegal or [[**unjust**, then]{.mark} the
proposal [can be **evaluated as unacceptable** from both]{.mark} a
**[consequentialist]{.mark} ethics** [and]{.mark} a
**[deontological]{.mark} ethical [position]{.mark}**. [Our framework
can]{.mark} therefore **[accommodate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
deontological [[**ethical issues** within a **broader consequentialist
perspective**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By inquiring into the motives of
action, the framework can also accommodate a virtue-ethical perspective.

**Gill-Tiney 22** Patrick Gill-Tiney, Stipendiary Lecturer in Politics,
St. John's College, Oxford, "A Liberal Peace?: The Growth of Liberal
Norms and the Decline of Interstate Violence," Journal of Conflict
Resolution, 66(3), 2022, pp.413-442 /GoGreen!

This article shows that [[**liberal interpretations** of
**sovereignty**]{.mark}, which emphasize international law,
interdependence, free trade, democracy and individual rights and
freedoms]{.underline}, have become increasingly prevalent in UN Security
Council resolutions since 1970. Given that two non-western states,
Russia/Soviet Union and China, are permanent members, I argue that the
content of these resolutions [[reflects **broad consensus**
between]{.mark} major [powers---**both western and
non-western**]{.mark}---as how these norms should be
interpreted]{.underline}. [This is **not** the same as arguing that
these states **share preferences or interests**]{.underline}, rather,
substantial differences remain, largely along the cleavage between the
United States, Britain and France on the one hand and China and Russia
on the other (Einsiedel and Malone 2018, 156-58).1 [**Yet**, the
**[collective positions]{.mark}** of these states [have **evolved over
time**]{.mark}, suggesting [a **shift** in **how sovereignty is
understood**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The dominant role that these states
have in shaping the international order means that their collective
understandings may be taken as representative of the normative structure
of international society at any point in time]{.underline}, with the
expectation that this impacts all states in the system.2

I argue that [[as **liberal interpretations** of]{.mark} these
fundamental [**norms** increase, the **likelihood** of]{.mark} a dispute
participant resorting to [**violence** decreases]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Through content analysis of all UN Security Council resolutions between
1970 and 2014 I first create a measure of the strength of liberal
interpretations of sovereignty. This is then utilized in
[**[quantitative analysis]{.mark}** of dispute participants]{.underline}
in the period to [explain the variation in the level of violence
employed]{.underline}. [I find statistical and substantive support for
my theory, [showing **empirically**]{.mark} that the growth in **liberal
norm interpretations** is **negatively associated** with the likelihood
of a state resorting to violence in an interstate dispute]{.underline}.

[This is [**not** to argue]{.mark} that [**structural** arguments are
wrong]{.mark}, far from it, **[nor]{.mark}** is it [to reject the roles
of conventional and nuclear capabilities]{.mark} in shaping interstate
conflict behavior. **[Rather]{.mark}**, **[state power does
matter]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is why the collective
interpretations of the permanent members of the UN Security Council are
used to understand the system. [Domestic veto players, intergovernmental
enforcement mechanisms, and trade dependency all do shape the responses
of policymakers during an interstate dispute. [However]{.mark}, the
**[intersubjective ideas]{.mark}** they carry with them into disputes
[are **also crucial to understand** why **some disputes escalate**, and
**others do not**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This article contributes to our understanding of the role that ideas
have in shaping interstate conflict in two ways. Firstly, I contribute
to the large literature which has sought to understand the role which
norms play in selecting for certain behaviors over others. Most of the
work within this area has been qualitative and has either charted the
development of specific bundles of norms over long periods (Keene 2012,
2013; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Sandholtz 2007) or focused on the
life-cycle of specific norms (Eckstein 1988; Finnemore 2000; Finnemore
and Sikkink 1998; Krook and True 2012; Nadelmann 1990; Sandholtz 2007;
Sandholtz and Stiles 2008). I build upon these insights by arguing that
the norm of sovereignty has been re-interpreted over time, and that the
collective nature of reinterpretation means that it can be used to
examine its impact in interstate conflict.

Secondly, this article provides an innovative means of exploring ideas
in a quantitative framework. The quantitative interstate conflict
literature has heavily favored structural and power-based explanations
for actor behavior. This has come at the particular expense of norms.
Whilst there is widespread acceptance that norms matter amongst these
scholars, they have tended to set aside norm-based explanations given
the difficulty of objective measurement. This difficulty revolves around
the problem of having surety that multiple actors share an idea, that
is, intersubjective understanding. The most obvious sources of data to
assess this would be a survey of policymakers or the content of
international legal documents. This first avenue is incredibly difficult
to gain anything but anecdotal responses too. Policymakers are hard to
get access to and may misrepresent their own thoughts and actions to
show themselves in as best light as possible. Ensuring that any
respondents have understood the survey in the same way is difficult
given language differences, whilst response rates are likely to be so
low as to prevent a non-random sample from being acquired, even if the
potential pool of relevant participants is widened to include all senior
politicians and bureaucrats, both incumbent and preceding.

Some of these problems are resolved by utilizing the texts of
international legal documents. Given that these are generally carefully
and cautiously written the researcher is more certain that the drafters
actually share an understanding of the topic. Recent work by Allee and
co-authors (Allee, Elsig, and Lugg 2017; Allee and Lugg 2016) have
innovatively utilized content analysis of interstate trade deals to
explore how much is replicated in subsequent deals, which sheds light on
the relative power of the participants. This has certainly gained deeper
understanding of the topic, but is not a suitable approach for this
research questions for two reasons. Firstly, these deals are generally
drafted by small numbers of states, that is, they may not be assumed to
represent the preferences and interests of nonparties. Secondly, whilst
interpretations are spelled out, these may be mechanistic rather than
ideational, making it unclear what the broader normative position may
be. This is made more acute by the drafting being down by bureaucrats
and lawyers rather than policymakers themselves. Whilst some direction
is no-doubt given by the latter, assuming a high level is problematic.
Utilizing the content of UN Security Council resolutions addresses these
problems because the documents may be assumed to be political, that is,
though member states are represented by ambassadors, a high-level of
involvement by their state governments is typical given the importance
attached to security issues. Moreover, since the permanent membership is
diverse in interests and preferences, and these members can veto
unpalatable resolutions, they may be reasonably assumed to provide
insight into intersubjective understandings.

Existing Explanations of Interstate Conflict and the Role of Norms

Two existing literatures are built on here, firstly, the broad
democratic peace literature, including its offshoots and opponents, and
secondly, scholarship on the evolution of international norms. The
former literature initially focused upon regime type, and over time has
been widened to include more fine-grained analyses of domestic political
structures in any state (Bell and Quek 2018; Fearon 1994; Gries et al.
2020; Huth and Allee 2002; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020; Weeks 2012;
Weiss 2013; Weiss and Dafoe 2019). However, the approach in all of these
works is to examine structures, that is, formal institutional
constraints encountered by decision makers, rather than norms, that is,
the role of shared principles, perceptions and expectations of behavior.
The distinction between norms and structure is not rigid. This is most
clearly seen in the term "institution" which is commonly used to mean
both formal structures which limit the agency of decision makers, but
also a set of norms, rules, and practices which govern a specific area.
To clarify the distinction being made in this article, I adapt the
nomenclature used by Reus-Smit (1999) who distinguishes between
constitutional institutions, norms without which a society of states
could not exist, and fundamental institutions, which facilitate
cooperation. The former includes sovereignty, as well as the rights of
self-determination and nonintervention, and the latter contractual
international law and the organizations which enforce it (both internal
and external to states). In this article, I term the former "norms" and
the latter "structures."

The democratic peace literature has spurred several offshoots, the most
relevant of which are those which have argued that rather than regime
type the "peace" is generated by economic factors including trade
interdependency and level of development (Gartzke 2007; Hegre 2000; Kim
2014; Kinne 2012; McDonald 2009, 2010; Mousseau 2013; Schneider and
Gleditsch 2010) or shared intergovernmental organization membership
(Appel 2018; Kinne 2013a, 2013b; Prorok and Appel 2014). More general
critiques have argued that any effect seen is due to the prior
settlement of territorial disputes (Gibler 2012; Gibler and Tir 2014;
Owsiak 2012), nuclear weapons (Waltz 1990), alliances (Kydd 2005),
unipolarity (Monteiro 2014) or military power (Layne 1994; Rosato 2003)
instead. With the exception of the latter critiques, this debate has
broadly accepted the importance of norms (Doyle 1986; Moravcsik 1997;
Owen 1994; Russett and Oneal 2001), especially as the "good" functioning
of domestic and international structures, particularly veto players,
requires political actors to have the right norms.

This relationship between norms and structures has been more closely
addressed through the focus on contracts, that is, to hone in on
specific economic norms and structures characterized as allowing an
economic market to function "with extensive and regularized transactions
among strangers that require an element of trust" (Mousseau and Xiongwei
2018, sec. Emergence Contractualist Peace). This literature argues that
the relationship between peace and democracy is spurious, and rather,
that both are explained by "contracturalist" norms and structures (Gelpi
and Grieco 2008; Mousseau, Hegre, and O'Neal 2003), which builds upon
the work of (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Dahl 1997; North, Wallis, and
Weingast 2009). Yet, the literature still relies upon
operationalizations which are essentially structural, that is, whilst
recognizing the importance of norms, the empirical testing has fallen
short.

A comparatively small subset of the literature has examined norms as an
explanation for the democratic peace. For Deutsch (1957), [[though
**NATO** is understood as a **structure**, a **security community** is
**more crucially** formed around **shared values**]{.mark}
(norms)]{.underline}. [Kahl argues that [the **basis** of]{.mark} the
democratic [**peace** is **collective identity**]{.mark} rooted in
liberal democracy **[interlinked by intergovernmental
organizations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (1998). For Risse, the influence of
NATO allies upon the foreign policy of the United States demonstrates
the importance of liberal norms, through a mechanism which relies upon
the similarity of domestic political institutions in these liberal
democracies and coalition-building (1995). Though valuable additions to
the literature, and in Deutsch's case systematic in its treatment of the
subject, these works fail to tackle the question of whether the
democratic peace is structural or norm based since the two are entwined
throughout. The difficulty in conceptualizing, isolating and
operationalizing norms is a clear problem. Broadly, it is hard to
isolate a norm from either the structure in which it exists or from
other norms for analysis. It is also a challenge to show that any norm
is truly intersubjective in understanding or to measure its effect upon
some outcome of interest. Yet, without attempts to do so we are left
with a partial picture, particularly for those emphasizing the
importance of structures---be these domestic or international---for
reducing interstate conflict. In short, the existence of a domestic
legislature, independent judiciary, or interstate treaties, is only
relevant if the individuals which employ them do so appropriately. To
understand this necessitates exploring the ideas in the heads of these
individuals, and particularly, how these ideas are shared.

In contrast to the large, predominantly quantitative, literature which
has examined the democratic peace and wider questions linking regime
type to the onset, conduct and termination of interstate disputes and
wars, the broader literature on interstate norms has tended to be
qualitative and highly focused. This has resulted in detailed work on
human rights (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), humanitarian intervention
(Wheeler 2000), and nuclear weapons (Rublee and Cohen 2018; Tannenwald
1999). There is no doubt that this has contributed to our understanding
of interstate relations, yet the clear shortcoming is generalizability.
That is, the specificity of these approaches, necessary to make any form
of causal claim, is in a sense also the undoing.

In this article I focus on the reinterpretation of the sovereignty norm
by powerful states. I argue that they have a dominant role in shaping
the normative landscape of the international system by being tasked with
the interpretation of norms and the maintenance of international society
(Hurrell 2007; Wight 1978; Saunders 2006). Operationalizing this, I
utilize UN Security Council resolutions as a means of assessing what the
consensus position of the permanent members is. Content analysis is used
to examine the normative framing of resolutions, allowing both an
exploration of change over time, and quantitative measures of the
relative strength of these ideas to be derived which can then be used in
regression analysis.

The Constraining Effect of Liberal Interpretations of Sovereignty

Norms are dynamic, and undergo processes of evolution, creation and
destruction. Change may occur gradually as actors shift their
understandings towards an alternative, or suddenly through systemic, and
thereby social, change. In international relations, the latter is
tightly linked to sudden shifts in great power authority, which has
typically occurred due to defeat and a subsequent realignment of
international order. War, and its aftermath, can lead to substantial
rearrangements of international order, meaning both a new distribution
of power, but also a re-interpretation of international society. In
examining change in understandings of sovereignty I term gradual change
"evolution" and sudden change "tectonic."

Interpretations of Sovereignty

The post-World War Two era allows examination of both evolutionary and
tectonic change in understandings of sovereignty. Evolution occurs
during relative peace, whilst tectonic change is part of major
realignments of international order. The end of the Cold War, though
non-violent certainly led to significant power shifts, resulting in a
tectonic change. The pre- and post-Cold War eras are eras of evolution.
Assessing rivalrous interpretation of norms is crucial to understanding
these changes. I outline a divergence between traditional and liberal
interpretations which are used to examine change in norms, and the
effect upon international conflict.

Over the post-World War Two period two interpretations of sovereignty
have existed, firstly, that emphasizing territorial sovereignty and
non-interference in the domestic affairs of others, and secondly, that
emphasizing international law, interdependence, free trade, democracy
and individual rights and freedoms in international affairs. I term the
former approach to sovereignty "traditional," and the latter "liberal."
A liberal interpretation of sovereignty, therefore, is one which places
emphasis upon the actions of states, particularly those between a
government and its citizens. Sovereignty in this understanding implies
not only the exercise of power over a territory and people (as in the
traditional understanding), but also that there are limits to the
exercise of power and duties to a people (Sandholtz and Stiles 2008,
287-88).3 This has been most clearly stated in the Responsibility to
Protect doctrine. I examine the relative balance between these two
interpretations over time, arguing that this balance alters how
sovereignty is understood, and thereby is related to the likelihood of
escalation in interstate disputes.

My expectation is that the relative balance between these two modes of
interpretation has shifted over the post-World War Two period to favor a
liberal interpretation. This does not mean that traditional
interpretations are irrelevant, rather, that they have been
de-emphasized in international discourse relative to the latter. A
spectrum in which purely traditional and purely liberal interpretations
mark the poles is conceived of as existing, with great powers occupying
positions between the two. The effect that this shift toward a liberal
interpretation of sovereignty has occurred on international conflict
escalation is now examined.

Understandings of Sovereignty and Conflict Escalation

How understandings of sovereignty impact international disputes may be
explored in terms of the conflict life-cycle, that is, why a dispute
emerges, why violent conflict breaks out, and how the conflict ends, or
in terms of participant conduct during war. Here, I examine the effect
of change in the collective understanding of sovereignty upon
escalation, meaning that I assume the prior existence of international
disputes. Whilst the effect of norms upon the onset of disputes is an
important question, very few disputes result in the use of violence,
that is, though onset is a necessary condition for violence, it is far
from sufficient. I examine escalation from a nonviolent dispute to a
violent dispute---the use of armed force in international
relations---because this is of greater substantive significance to state
leaders and their citizens. Moreover, whilst reducing the likelihood of
dispute onset would likely result in less international violence, the
more normatively important question is how to avoid escalation, as this
reduces the costs of war: human death and economic destruction.

This is not to trivialize dispute onset, and logically we might expect
the growth of liberal understandings of sovereignty to also reduce onset
rates as well as escalation likelihood. However, there are two reasons
why we may doubt the substantive significance of this, firstly, dispute
onset is a relatively low threshold, and secondly, onset is often
triggered by events beyond the direct control of a state. To this first
point, a dispute simply means that two or more actors disagree over
something, oftentimes the behavior of the other side or the distribution
of some good (for instance, territory). This article utilizes
Militarized Interstate Disputes as the operationalization of dispute,
and many disputes are comparatively minor events, with the threshold
being that one of the two parties has a minimum level of militarization
as part of the dispute (for example, the issuance of a deterrent, or
compellent, threat). A focus on onset, therefore, would prevent
observation of substantively more important actions, that is, the actual
use of force against another. Secondly, many disputes begin due to
accident and/or the decision making of low-level military commanders or
political officials who are neither in the position to consider national
interests nor strategic interactions. This means that onset may
essentially be an apolitical decision which takes little or no account
of the broader strategic landscape nor the structural and normative
context. It is after onset, that is, when escalation is considered by
policymakers, that the stakes are higher and when causal mechanisms
common to this topic are most active.

Escalation then, is a political decision. [In making the **choice to
escalate**, or not, policymakers are impacted by a range of strategic
factors, but **crucially**, are also **constrained by norms**. The
[**use of force** in **i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations
**[must be justified]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and since 1945 the UN
Charter specifies just two: self-defense and collective peace
enforcement. To this, we might also add humanitarian intervention,
though this remains contested. As a baseline, therefore, when faced with
dispute onset, policymakers must justify their actions with reference to
one of these reasons. Moreover, [[in making the **decision to
escalate**, policymakers are]{.mark} also [**constrained by liberal
values** which]{.mark} emphasize diplomacy, cooperation, international
law, international organizations, the rights of the individual, and to
[**question the legitimacy** of]{.mark} the march to **[war]{.mark}**.
Taken together, [this **slows the decision to escalate**, since **legal
justification is needed**, **diplomacy is necessary**, and]{.mark}
potential **[economic and human costs]{.mark}** understood,
**[calculated]{.mark}** and defended]{.underline}. [[A **shift toward
liberal interpretations**]{.mark} thereby [means]{.mark} a **[reduced
probability of escalation to violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, tacitly
assuming that the risk of a dispute arising in the first-place is
unchanged. This leads me to my first hypothesis, which relates to the
evolution mechanism of change:

Hypothesis 1: [Given an international dispute, the risk of **escalation
decreases as liberal interpretations increase**]{.underline}.

[An alternative explanation is that any impact of normative change is
actually a result of the end of the Cold War, that is, the
redistribution of power between great powers]{.underline}, typically
resulting from system-wide conflict [results in qualitative differences
in interpretations of fundamental norms]{.underline} between
peace-periods. Whilst the end of the Cold War did not involve a
system-wide war, it did mark the end of sustained rivalry between great
powers. The pre- and post- periods can thereby be compared. Given the
rivalry of the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and
the relative dominance of the United States post-Cold War, we might
expect qualitative differences in conflict behavior to be observable in
the two time periods, attributable, perhaps, to a greater emphasis upon
liberal interpretations in the post-Cold War era. The dramatic [change
in the distribution of power triggered a significant change in the
consensus surrounding interpretation of fundamental norms of
international society]{.underline}. This leads me to my second
hypothesis, which captures the tectonic change mechanism:

Hypothesis 2: [The risk of dispute **escalation decreases** given a
**systemic increase in liberal interpretations** of sovereignty
attributable to the end of the Cold War]{.underline}.

5.2. The Consequences of Non-Intervention

The War on Terror has raised concerns over the future of the practise of
humanitarian intervention. Indeed [it would seem [the **liberal
agenda**]{.mark}, despite its ideological foundations of universalism
and cosmopolitanism, [has **exhausted what little political will and
strategic capabilities existed for**]{.mark} **true humanitarian
[intervention]{.mark} in the pursuit of Western security** in an
increasingly insecure world]{.underline}. **[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to respond to the ever darkening cloud the War on Terror is casting over
humanitarian intervention by [**[dismissing the practise
entirely]{.mark}** is to [render a **valuable instrument**]{.mark} in
the protection of human rights as **[undeservedly
useless]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Heinze 2006: 31). Proponents of
humanitarian intervention have argued that [[those who
**dismiss**]{.mark} humanitarian [**intervention** as]{.mark} simply [a
**vehicle through which liberal regimes**]{.mark} wish to
**[extend]{.mark} their [control]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} ―**[condemning
other people to death]{.mark}**]{.underline}‖ (Rieff 1999) [and ―leaving
the innocent to suffer the world over]{.underline}‖ (Ramos-Horta 2005:
284) through being overtly politically correct. It is difficult to
counter such arguments when we consider the consequences of
nonintervention in Rwanda, as well as the consequences of intervention
where political commitment to the cause is lacking, as was the case with
the Srebenica massacre. Such [morally abhorrent events were allowed to
happen as a direct consequence of a lack of strategic interest for the
states with the power to intervene]{.underline}, and have led to
commentators such as Richard Just to argue that [despite the
controversies the War on Terror has wrought upon the practise of
humanitarian intervention, to respond by saying that it is wrong for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to intervene to spread its own
moral universal values is to condemn the interventions in Bosnia and
Kosovo which stopped ethnic cleansing and possibly genocide, and to
agree with the decision not to intervene in Rwanda as right]{.underline}
(Just 2005: 212), [a position which most would find morally
unacceptable]{.underline}. Here then we can clearly see the crux of the
problem, in that [non-intervention is intolerable, but humanitarian
intervention]{.underline}, as has clearly been demonstrated in previous
chapters, [remains impossible]{.underline} (**[Falk]{.underline}** 1993:
757).

[[Such a problematic]{.mark} of humanitarian intervention [requires
confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline} if future human rights atrocities are
to be halted, and [[if the unchecked spread of liberal technologies of
governance]{.mark} and control [is to be challenged]{.mark}. [It is
**not enough simply to denounce**]{.mark} humanitarian intervention as
reflecting only the **[imperial interests]{.mark}** of ˑpowerful western
governments]{.underline}, as ex-UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
highlighted when he posed the question, ―If humanitarian intervention
is, indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, [**how should we
respond** to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica---to gross and systematic
violations of human rights that offend every precept of our common
humanity?]{.underline}‖ (Annan 2000) Even if one were to argue for an
absolute rule of non-intervention so as to avoid abuse of the
humanitarian sentiment by liberal regimes, [one need only look at the
interventions in Kosovo and Iraq to note that international
legitimization is not a necessary precursor to liberal
intervention]{.underline}. Given the power Western liberal states have
to override international legal norms to intervene in situations which
threaten their interests and security, and given the fact that there
exists many parts of the world where the humanitarian situation remains
intolerable, [to respond to the liberal crusade towards intervention by
calling for a steadfast rule of non-intervention is [**not only
impossible**, but]{.mark} **also [immoral]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

The debate over the legitimacy and conduct of humanitarian intervention
continues to rage fiercely within the international community,
particularly in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and the declaration of
the War on Terror. From growing calls for more humanitarian action and
political involvement to solve the humanitarian crises of the 90s, to
international scepticism and condemnation of the liberal interventions
in the Middle East following the events of 9/11, it comes as no surprise
that humanitarian intervention is generally deemed to be ―in crisis‖
(Rieff 2002). As this essay has demonstrated, the waning of state
sovereignty and the subsequent rise in humanitarian' interventions has
been an emergent reality throughout the 1990s; yet far from being the
result of a growing humanism amongst the powerful liberal states, such a
shift in concern from the state to the individual is in reality part of
a much more sinister liberal enterprise which is quintessentially
concerned with the art of global governance (Gordon 1991: 14). The
repercussions of the implication of liberal self- interests alongside
the achievement of humanitarian goals has been highlighted only too
clearly in an analysis of the development of humanitarian intervention
throughout the 1990s, during which time it became painfully clear that
intervention undertaken for purely humanitarian concerns, if it occurs
at all, has generally been underfunded and insufficient (Falk 2000:
333), therefore leading to interventions which arguably did more harm
than good. Rwanda provides us with a clear example of what happens when,
despite grave humanitarian concerns, there exists no strategic interests
for the states with the power to intervene, whilst events in Somalia,
Bosnia and Kosovo illustrated the fact that in the absence of state
self-interest, there exists little political will to pay the costs of
blood and gold in order to ensure that ―humanitarian war is conducted in
a humanitarian manner.‖ (Falk 2000: 331) The 1990s then, far from being
the ‗golden era of humanitarian intervention' (Bellamy and Wheeler
2008), were in reality an experimentation in liberal expansionism, yet
where there existed few security concerns for the liberal states, there
existed little political will to commit to the mission. It is only when
national interests are implicated that states are willing to accept the
costs and stay the duration necessary to alter the humanitarian
situation in any meaningful way (Weiss 2004: 37).

As has been noted throughout this essay, [the vital interests of the
intervening states are grounded in liberal notions of human security;
that is to say **[entire swathes of the world]{.mark}'s population [are
re-conceptualized as a threat to humanity]{.mark} which requires
pacification through assimilation into the liberal world order or,
failing that, destruction**]{.underline}. [In liberalisms quest to
expand its control and influence across the world, the remit of
intervention has been broadened to include within its scope democracy
spreading, nation building, and regime change, as has been demonstrated
in Iraq, Afghanistan, and more recently, Libya]{.underline}. [**It would
seem [undeniable that humanitarian intervention is]{.mark} essentially
[a veil]{.mark} behind which liberal imperialism can disguise itself**,
despite protestations of liberals heralding a ―revolution of moral
concern]{.underline}‖. Indeed, we can see clear similarities between the
old rhetoric of empire and current discussions surrounding liberal
imperialism. As Nardin has noted, in the old days of empire
humanitarianism was used to justify the imposition of foreign power on
populations at the margins of the ‗civilized' world in order to uphold
the standards of civilized morality; essentially in order to protect the
population from themselves. We can see that little has changed between
then and now when we note that current rhetoric on humanitarian
intervention constructs the third world as a threat to itself and to the
rest of the world, and therefore the barbarity of tyranny and terrorism
that these ‗uncivilized' regions breed ―must be countered, in the name
of humanity, by the exercise of imperial power‖ (Nardin 2006: 25). In
construing humanitarian intervention as liberal imperialism, the motives
behind liberal intervention become clearer, in that essentially liberal
regimes wish to subjugate and impose indirect control on those portions
of the population securitization discourse has constructed as a threat
to global security. Whilst it is true that the days of territorial
expansion are over, what we are experiencing now is by no means a waning
of imperial ambition, as through the spread of liberal values and the
imposition of liberal structures, through force if necessary, liberalism
is extending its ‗universal' values across the world, justifying any
means by the end which is indisputably morally right (Bishai 2004: 51).

Indeed, as was highlighted in chapter four, there exists a significant
cognitive dissonance between liberal universalism, with its proclaimed
notions of a cosmopolitan humanitarianism, and liberal imperialism,
which finds its expression through intervention which is justified on a
humanitarian basis, yet which in reality functions through the
eradication or exclusion of all life forms which do not conform to
liberalism (McCarthy 2009: 166). It would seem that the obvious
conclusion to draw would be one which wholly condemns the practise of
humanitarian intervention as a front for the furthering of a liberal
ideology which functions through the subjugation of morally inferior'
populations so as to extend its own remit of control and power.
Humanitarian intervention is less about a moral concern for the
suffering of people, than a method through which Western liberal states
can secure their own populations from a global imaginary of threat.
[**[Yet such a damning analysis]{.mark} of liberal intervention [is
incomplete]{.mark}, as it [fails to give]{.mark} a [sufficient analysis
of the effects these interventions have on]{.mark} the
[populations]{.mark} concerned, [not to mention the effects
non-intervention could have on those populations]{.mark} suffering**
human rights abuses]{.underline}. **[Of course a proclaimed interest in
saving strangers' will only ever be put into action when the strategic
interests of liberal states are at stake]{.underline}**, meaning liberal
cries of a duty to intervene' and a responsibility to protect' in those
situations that shock the moral conscience of mankind must be regarded
with scepticism. Such [**[scepticism]{.mark}**, however, **[should not
be translated into an absolute rule]{.mark}** of nonintervention, as to
do so would be **[to turn our backs]{.mark}** completely **[on the
suffering of those that need our help, in whatever form such help may
come in]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Indeed, the spread of liberal
imperialism does not necessarily signify the death of humanitarian
sentiments; rather the two can coincide, and when they do, a greater
window of opportunity is created for those wishing to act on the
humanitarian impulse]{.underline} in the Security Council (Weiss 2004:
37).

When we consider the globalizing effect the War on Terror has had on
liberal intervention, however, as we move further into the new
millennium it is becoming ever clearer that liberal intervention is
being stretched to its limits. Ten years after the invasion of
Afghanistan and eight years after the invasion of Iraq, 99,000 and
46,000 US troops remained in each country respectively (New York Times
2011), highlighting the extensive nature of the liberal imperial mission
in the aftermath of 9/11. The ‗unending war' against terrorism seems to
have taken its toll on Western liberal states capacity to intervene,
meaning that, rather than coinciding, the requirements of the war
against terrorism will have to be balanced against the more distant
demands of humanity (Macfarlane et al 2007: 985), and it is not
difficult to work out which will prevail. Indeed, since the coming to
power of the Bush administration in 2001, humanitarian intervention
where no national interests were at stake has been dismissed as
―blunting the purpose of the military‖ (Ignatieff 2003), yet quite
paradoxically Bush pinned continuing support for the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan on humanitarian rhetoric regarding nation-building and the
promotion of democracy for the Afghan and Iraqi people. In doing so it
would seem that the US has manipulated the idea of a responsibility to
protect to include a much broader remit for intervention, embracing not
just the ―responsibility to react‖ but the ―responsibility to prevent‖
and the ―responsibility to rebuild‖ as well (Evans and Sahnoun 2002:
101), stretching the language of humanitarianism to suit liberalisms own
political agenda. As has been evidenced by the growing disillusionment
with the on-going operations in the Middle East in which thousands of
western troops have been killed, the continued threat of terrorist
attacks, and more recently the lack of political support for further
meaningful interventions in Libya and Syria, it would seem that liberal
interventionism has not only lost sight of the universal humanitarian
notions that lie at its roots, but is struggling to retain its
omnipotence in the face of widespread opposition to the invasions in
Iraq and Afghanistan. Whilst the 9/11 attacks may have had a 'rally
round the flag' effect within the US, the most ardent exporter of
international liberalism, it has had the opposite effect across the rest
of the international community, which has sought to distance itself from
the aggressively Western liberal interventionist stance that provoked
such terrorist attacks (Ignatieff 2003).

All things considered, it would seem that Fukuyama's prediction in 1992
that the rise to predominance of Western liberal democracy would signal
the ‗End of History' in that it would become the universal and final
form of human government (Fukuyama 1992) is increasingly being
challenged. The rise in militant Islam and terrorist attacks against the
West highlights inescapably that the proclaimed universal moral
righteousness of the liberal mission is in reality far from universal,
whilst the rising spectre of China as the new superpower on the
international stage could diminish Western liberalisms power and
influence in years to come. This being said, [the reality remains that,
for now at least, Western liberal regimes retain hegemony on the global
stage, and therefore hegemony in decisions to intervene or
not]{.underline}. As we have seen, liberal humanitarian' intervention is
deeply flawed; oftentimes the primary motives for intervention are far
from humanitarian, and there is much resentment in the international
community regarding the omnipotence of the Western liberal states
wishing to impose their world view on weaker states. What is more, the
War on Terror has only exemplified such concerns, highlighting the way
in which [liberal states have manipulated humanitarian sentiments to
justify intervention with other motives]{.underline} (Ayoob 2002) [and
allowed liberalism to broaden its scope of expansion
globally]{.underline} (**[Evans 2010]{.underline}**). [**Yet the reality
is that** liberal intervention, however imperfect and unpalatable it may
be is currently the only choice the international community has if it is
to avoid another Rwanda, or another Srebenica, to avoid once again
becoming a bystander to genocide]{.underline}. As we have seen, **[where
no other interests exist, attempts at humanitarianism will
flounder]{.underline}**. [To argue for intervention motivated by purely
humanitarian motives and conducted in a completely humanitarian manner
is to ignore the realities of the world in which we live. The reality is
that]{.underline}, as Weiss quite succinctly put it, [the rise to
predominance of **[liberal imperialism]{.mark}** and the resultant
convergence of humanitarian values and liberal security interests ―[has
**not** brought **utopia**, **but** made the world a]{.mark} somewhat
**[more liveable place than it would have been
otherwise]{.mark}**]{.underline}‖ (2001: 104). Whether this remains the
case in the aftermath of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, in a
seemingly endless War against Terror, and in a world where Western
liberalism is increasingly feeling threatened yet where political
support and capacity for liberal intervention is low, remains to be
seen.

Conclusion

This article has examined genealogy as a form of critique in IR. The
first part of the article demonstrated that Foucault's [genealogy was an
important component in]{.underline} the work of the first generation of
[**[post-structuralist IR]{.mark}** as well as in contemporary
scholarship [informed by]{.mark} frameworks of governmentality and
**[biopolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It was shown that [when genealogy
is understood as critique, violence risks being inscribed as
foundational to global political life]{.underline}. However, despite the
fact that it is virtually impossible to understand the meaning of
"critical" in this work without a grasp of genealogy, the assumptions of
genealogy have been insufficiently engaged. To rectify this, the second
part of the article critically examined the philosophical underpinnings
of genealogy. Through a close reading of three core texts where Foucault
grapples with genealogy, it was shown that [genealogy relies on an
**ontology of forces**, which are postulated as **arbitrarily and
violently related**. Genealogy therefore tends to **inscribe violence as
foundational to social relations**]{.underline}. It was further noted
that [genealogically informed critique brings a peculiar form of
suspicion to all that is presented as common, shared, and
universal]{.underline}. This suspicion was traced back to Nietzsche and
characterized as "baseless," [which again reflects a set of particular
ontological commitments idiosyncratic to genealogy]{.underline}. [These
commitments, which inscribe violence as foundational, were]{.underline}
finally [**contrasted to** an **ontology** which follows the
genealogical understanding of emergent forces, but **refuses the
assumption** of them as **arbitrarily and violently
related**]{.underline}.

Finally, what are the implications for empirical Foucauldian work for
the argument I have pursued in the article? [In **empirical work**
informed by governmentality and **biopolitics**, IR scholars often
[examine the **encounter between Western and non-Western
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The problem]{.underline} to which I
ultimately want to draw attention [is not that such scholarship is often
critical of military intervention undertaken by Western
powers]{.underline}. On the contrary, it is important to bring out and
critically scrutinize the paternalistic and indeed hierarchical
renditions that no doubt are common in, for instance, the liberal peace
project (e.g. Richmond, 2011). [The problem is rather that the
genealogical ethos risks **turning into a global interpretive
disposition, with which all global interactions by whatever means are
made a priori suspect**. [Instead of seeking]{.mark} to engage in a
**careful [empirical consideration of the merits of forms of
intervention in each case]{.mark}**, [the **generalized**]{.mark}
**genealogical [suspicion]{.mark} \[[hinders]{.mark}\] disables [any
other understanding of global political life than]{.mark} a
[ceaseless]{.mark} unfolding drama of [clashing wills to
dominate]{.mark} and conquer**]{.underline}. [Since the liberal project
is exposed as just a particular will to power, it must inscribe a
relation of violent hierarchy to non-Western localities, as opposed to
an understanding of similar and harmoniously overlapping subjectivities
already existing in those places]{.underline}. On such a
pre-methodological genealogical disposition, [[**intervention becomes
suspicious in whatever form it may take**. Whether]{.mark} it is in the
form of [**peacekeeping troops** or]{.mark} rule of law advisors
**[assisting]{.mark} local actors [in security sector reform]{.mark}**,
**any involvement [can only be read as a manifestation of "the West's"
ongoing will to colonize]{.mark}** and impose its will on
others]{.underline}.

The genealogical disposition easily lends itself to an assertion of
incommensurability, more often than not coded in terms of "culture,"
since the clashing wills to power in Foucault's ontology of emergence do
not belong to a common space; they have nothing in common. [[What
is]{.mark} made suspect to the extent of \[[hindered]{.mark}\] disabled
[is]{.mark} genuine **[social learning through communication]{.mark}**,
which presupposes that different sociocultural settings may display
profound similarities of aspirations of what is desired]{.underline}.
For instance, holding out the possibility that whatever goes under the
label of human rights, and especially its minimalist rendition of what
human means, is compatible with a range of walks and ways, may
harmoniously blend with, and may resonate with many traditions around
the world is perhaps the ultimate hope on which the liberal peace
project rests (e.g. Moyn, 2010). This hope, however, is disabled
\[hindered\] by a peculiar form of genealogical faith which lures the
researcher to interpret all human interaction as disguising a ceaseless
and primordial clash of wills to power.

Following the argument pursued in this article, [one needs to realize
that the **genealogical disposition** is reflective of certain
**ontological assumptions** which **are but one option**. Empirical work
in IR informed by governmentality frameworks is no doubt valuable in
that such work opens up for a much more extensive power analysis than
approaches that reify state actors as the only relevant actors in global
politics]{.underline}. Moreover, Foucault's writings on biopolitics have
served as a starting point for examining what happens when life rather
than territory become the object of rule, thus broadening the
traditional focus in IR to include geopolitics and biopolitics (e.g.
Vaughan-Williams, 2015). [However]{.underline}, when conducting
empirical work in such traditions, [[it is **important to refrain from
reading an ontology of violence into**]{.mark} **the [empirical
analyses]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or at the very least, reflect on the
ethico-political stakes involved in doing so.

#### No "liberal wars"

David **Chandler 9**, Professor of IR at University of Westminster,
\"Liberal War and Foucaultian Metaphysics\", Review of Dillon and Reid's
*The Liberal Way of War: Killing to Make Life Live*,
www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gsics-publication/jics/chandler_18-1.pdf

[This is a book about the 'liberal way of war']{.underline}. But [the
liberal referred to in the title remains under theorized]{.underline}.
On several occasions the authors highlight the distinction between the
liberal way of war and the general framing of war in the modern liberal
era as a geo-strategic contestation, taking the territorial state as its
referent object. For Dillon and Reid, 'liberalism never fitted this
model of modern politics and the modern problematization of war very
well'（p.83). They therefore seek to define liberalism and the liberal
way of war as distinct from war in the liberal era. **[[The liberal way
of war refers not to real wars]{.mark} and conflicts [but]{.mark} to [an
abstract model]{.mark} of conflict]{.underline}**, defined as a desire
to'remove war from the life of humanity'which'derives from the way in
which liberalism takes the life of the species as its referent object of
politics ─ biopolitics'（p.84）. [In this framing, the liberal nature of
war very much depends on the self-description of the conflict by its
proponents]{.underline}: these range from Gladstone's occupation of
Egypt in the cause of'suffering humanity', to US liberal ideological
constructions of the cause of'freedom'in the Cold War struggle against
the Soviet Union up to Bush and Blair's war on Iraq in the cause of
humanity（p.6）. As the authors state, of course, [wars may be fought on
other grounds than universal humanity: 'liberal states may...also act as
geopolitical sovereign actors as well...and may also have geopolitical
motives]{.underline} for the wars they wage'（p.84）.¶ **[It is clear
from the beginning that [the distinctiveness of ']{.mark}the
[liberal]{.mark} way of [war]{.mark}' which they seek to explore [cannot
be more than a fool's quest]{.mark}]{.underline}**. They assert that
they will critically uncover the paradox of liberal war: why it is that
Realist or geostrategic war accepts the necessity of war but attempts to
limit it, while liberals wish to end war but, to do so, are willing to
fight unlimited wars. Yet, they admit that **[[this starting point
is]{.mark} already [an ideological dead end]{.mark}]{.underline}** [─
the [wars of the twentieth century give the lie to the]{.mark} idea that
there is some [distinction between 'unending crusades' and 'limited
jousts]{.mark} between rationally calculative political subjects': war
has its own dynamic]{.underline}（p.7). [Nevertheless, Dillon and Reid
press on and seek to go beyond a Schmittian critique]{.underline} to
ground this paradox in the biopolitical'driver'of the liberal way of
rule ─ biopolitics: wars waged under the banner of the human（against
humans）are liberal and, allegedly biopolitical, as human life is
declared to be the referent in need of being secured. [These wars are
[alleged]{.mark} to be fought differently to geo-political wars for
territory, because the '[drivers' of war are]{.mark} not territorialized
interests but the biopolitical [framings of the]{.mark} needs of the
[human]{.mark}, how human life can and should be lived.]{.underline}
[Inevitably [there are **insuperable methodological hurdles** to
this]{.mark} Sisyphusian task]{.underline}. Already, [there occurs the
first fundamental aporia: [how do we tell the difference between a
liberal and non-liberal war?]{.mark}]{.underline} [There appears to be
no way of preventing the category of liberal war from becoming a
lifeless and descriptive one: wars are liberal and fought biopolitically
only if we are told that these are the motives by those fighting
them]{.underline}.¶ **[[This separation of liberal ways of war from
territorialised framings]{.mark} of geostrategic contestation [makes
little sense]{.mark}]{.underline}** [as a framework for
understanding]{.underline} either liberal rule or liberal ways of
[war]{.underline}. In fact, [in defining liberal war in this way the
connection between liberal rule and war is entirely
severed]{.underline}. ['Liberal war may on occasions also be
geopolitical; which is to say that war may be simultaneously
geopolitical as well as biopolitically driven since the imperatives
behind war are never uniform or simple; but what distinguishes the
liberal way of war as liberal are the biopolitical imperatives which
have consistently driven its violent peace-making.'（p.85）Liberal rule
has also resulted in wars for territory or in defence of
territories]{.underline}; nevertheless, a story, of course, could have
been told about how views of the human fitted those of struggles to
command territory. [This is acknowledged, but sits uneasily with the
narrow view of liberal war for species life.]{.underline} If the racial
doctrines of European empires, up to and including the genocidal racism
of the Nazi regime, were also biopolitically driven ─ and the authors,
indeed, write of race as part of the'liberal biopolitics of the
seventeenth century'─ then [it seems difficult to separate a liberal way
of war from allegedly 'non-liberal' wars of territorial
control]{.underline}.¶ It seems clear that Dillon and Reid do not seek
to take the logical step of arguing that the view of the human reflects,
and is reflected by, how the human is ruled and how wars are both
thought and fought. Why? Because for them there is something
suprahistorically unique and distinct about the liberal way of war: a
distinctly liberal view which foregrounds the human as the referent of
security. Therefore, **[a second aporia arises: on what basis is this
specifically 'liberal'?]{.underline}** [[It would appear]{.mark} that
[every form of rule]{.mark} and of war [has]{.mark} at least [an
implicit view of the 'human']{.mark} and through this view of the human
the form of rule and the way of war are rationalized. [There is
not]{.mark} and cannot be [anything]{.mark} specifically ['liberal'
about this]{.mark}]{.underline}. The humanity in need of securing,
through war on other humans, could be formed by Alexander the Great's
stoic cosmopolitan vision, or could be'God's chosen people', 'the master
race', or 'the gains of the proletarian revolution': there is little
doubt that beliefs of what the human is, or could become, were a vital
part of many non-Liberal dispositifs ─ the discourses and practices - of
both rule and war. ¶ **[[The]{.mark} key starting [assumption]{.mark},
that [the liberal way of war can be isolated]{.mark} from any other -
[and]{.mark}]{.underline}** its alleged specific form, of '**[[unending
violence', explained by its referent]{.mark} of the human -
[appears]{.mark} to be]{.underline}** a **[particularly
[unproductive]{.mark}]{.underline}** one. [At the level of abstraction
at which Dillon and Reid choose to work, there is very little here that
would help to distinguish between a liberal and a non-liberal way of
war]{.underline}（the asserted purpose of the book）. Of course, what
matters is what this view of the human is. Here [Dillon and
Reid]{.underline} appear to [recognise the limits of their
essentializing approach]{.underline}: ...just as the liberal way of rule
is constantly adapting and changing so also is the liberal way of war.
There is, in that sense, no one liberal way of rule or one liberal way
of war. But there is a fundamental continuity which justifies us
referring to the singular...the fact that each takes the properties of
species existence as its referent object...finding its expression
historically in many changing formations of rule according...to the
changing exigencies and understanding of species being...（p.84）¶
[Rather than understand our forms of post-political rule and
post-territorial war today on their own terms]{.underline} and then
consider to what extent this way of rule and war can be theorized, and
to what extent, if any, Foucault's conception of biopolitics may be of
assistance, [Dillon and Reid start out from the assumption that we live
in a liberal world of rule and war and that therefore both can be
critiqued]{.underline} through the framework developed by Foucault in
his engagement with understanding the rise and transformation of liberal
forms of rule. [In transposing Foucault's critical engagement with
liberal ways of rule to an understanding of liberal ways of war, Dillon
and Reid take a body of historical work about the changing political
nature of liberal rule and transpose it into an essentialised and under
theorized understanding of liberal war.]{.underline} This is no mean
feat; how they manage this accomplishment will be discussed in the next
two sections.

### AT: ! -- Structural Root Causes

#### They have everything backwards -- no structural root causes -- AND radical transformation wouldn't solve -- BUT proximate focus does

John **Horgan 14**. Director of the Center for Science Writings at
Stevens Institute of Technology, "To End War, Focus on Culture Rather
than \"Root Causes\"", Scientific American, 8-18,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/to-end-war-focus-on-culture-rather-than-root-causes/

When I started researching war, [I]{.underline} also [assumed that to
get rid of war, we have to get rid of its root causes. The trouble is,
[scholars]{.mark} have [identified countless causes of war]{.mark}. One
pseudo-explanation]{.underline} (which I\'m glad Kloor does not mention,
and which I rebut early on in my book and in posts such as this) [is
that war stems from]{.underline} a compulsion bred into our ancestors by
natural selection. [Biology]{.underline} underpins war, as it underpins
all human behaviors. The crucial question is, why does war break out in
certain places and times and not others? [The most popular
non-biological explanations]{.underline} of war [are]{.underline} what I
call [the **Malthusian** and **Marxist** hypotheses. The
first]{.underline} posits [that war stems from our tendency to
over-reproduce and hence fight over land and other resources. The second
holds that war stems from inequality, the tendency of societies
(especially capitalist ones) to divide into haves and
have-nots]{.underline}. [[Scholars]{.mark} have]{.underline} also
[[blamed]{.mark} wars on [**religion**, **racism** and
**nationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Kloor mentions above, [[as
well as]{.mark} such **fundamental [social traits]{.mark}** as
hierarchy, sexism and injustice. [If you **cherry pick**, you]{.mark}
**always [find evidence]{.mark}** to support your favorite
theory]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} as scholars]{.underline} such as
Lewis Fry Richardson (whom my friend David Berreby recently profiled)
[have shown]{.underline}, neither the Malthusian and Marxist theories
**[[no]{.underline}]{.mark}**r any of the other **[[explanations]{.mark}
above can [account for the]{.mark} vast [diversity of
wars]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Moreover, [some factors that provoke
conflict]{.underline}, such as religion, [can also inhibit
it]{.underline}. Religion has inspired some of our greatest antiwar
leaders, notably Gandhi and Martin Luther King. I have found [only one
theory of war that fits the facts]{.underline}. The theory holds [that
[war]{.mark} is a self-perpetuating, contagious meme, which [can
propagate **independently of**]{.mark} **other [social]{.mark} and
environmental [factors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As anthropologist
Margaret Mead put it in a famous 1940 essay, \"Warfare Is Only an
Invention---Not a Biological Necessity.\" In other words, the major
cause of war is war itself, which has a terrible tendency to spread even
to societies that would prefer to remain peaceful. I make this point in
my book and in a 2010 blog post, \"Margaret Mead's war theory kicks butt
of neo-Darwinian and Malthusian models.\" Here is an edited excerpt: In
his 1997 book War Before Civilization, anthropologist Lawrence Keeley
notes that war among North American Indians often stemmed from the
aggression of just a few extremely warlike tribes, \"rotten apples that
spoiled their regional barrels.\" He added, \"Less aggressive societies,
stimulated by more warlike groups in their vicinity, become more
bellicose themselves.\" Societies in a violent region, the political
scientist Azar Gat emphasizes in his 2006 book War in Human
Civilization, have a strong incentive to carry out preemptive attacks.
Societies may \"attack the other side in order to eliminate or severely
weaken them as a potential enemy. Indeed, this option only makes the
other side more insecure, rendering the security dilemma more acute. War
can thus become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of war breeds
war.\" [[Many]{.mark} people [are **pessimistic**]{.mark} about ending
war because [they assume it will require **radical**]{.mark} **social
[engineering]{.mark}**. World peace will require eliminating poverty,
inequality, sexism, **racism** or **\[fill in the
blank\]**.]{.underline} We will need to eradicate religion, or all
embrace the same religion. We will need to get rid of all nation states
and become anarchists, or form a single global government. [My
analysis]{.underline} of war [suggests that if we want to end war, **[we
don\'t need]{.mark} to create [a society radically different]{.mark}**
from our own, let alone a utopia. If we want to end war, we should
[focus on ending war]{.mark}]{.underline} and the culture of war
[[rather than]{.mark} on **[supposed causal factors]{.mark}**. If we can
do that, [we will **take a major step toward solving
many**]{.mark}]{.underline} of our **[[other]{.mark} social
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as I argued in my previous post. And
that brings me to Keith Kloor\'s final challenge to me. He devotes much
of his column to a discussion of how extremists on both sides of the
conflict between Israel and Palestine have \"hijacked the peace process.
Horrific spasmodic cycles of violence and death is the result.\" He asks
me how we can \"rid the world of extremist groups that sow the seeds of
war.\" [Kloor [has]{.mark}]{.underline} his [**[causation
backwards]{.mark}**. Just as [war promotes]{.mark} poverty, tyranny,
[inequality]{.mark} and resource depletion **[at least as much as vice
versa]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so war promotes fanaticism. Once
militarism seizes hold of a society, it can transform vast populations
into virtual sociopaths. It turns decent, ethical, reasonable people
into intolerant fanatics capable of the most heinous acts. [Breaking out
of]{.underline} what Kloor calls \"spasmodic [cycles of
violence]{.underline} and death\" [can be]{.underline} extraordinarily
[difficult, but history offers many examples of societies that have done
just that. Germany and France were bitter, bloody rivals for centuries.
But it is now inconceivable that Germany and France]{.underline}---or
any members of the European Union\--[would go to war]{.underline}
against each other. [One of my favorite examples of a nation that has
renounced militarism is Costa Rica]{.underline}. Like many of its
neighbors in Central American, Costa was once wracked by terrible
violence. But [after a bloody civil war in the 1940s, Costa Rica
disbanded its army]{.underline}, freeing up more funds for education,
health care, transportation and tourism. It is often ranked as one of
the most peaceful, healthy, \"happy\" nations in the world.

### AT: ! -- Value To Life

#### Value to life is inevitable and subjective -- their assertions are the only scenario for negative value

Ethics: A Case-Based Approach, p. 112, November 2002 /GoGreen!

The second assertion made by supporters of the quality of life as a
criterion for decisionmaking is closely related to the first, but with
an added dimension. This assertion suggests that [the [determination
of]{.mark} the [value of]{.mark} the quality of a given [life is a
subjective determination to be made by the person experiencing that
life]{.mark}]{.underline}. The important addition here is that the
decision is a personal one that, ideally, ought not to be made
externally by another person but internally by the individual involved.
Katherine Lewis made this decision for herself based on a comparison
between two stages of her life. So did James Brady. [Without this
element, [decisions based on quality]{.mark} of life criteria
[lack]{.mark} salient [information]{.mark}]{.underline} and the patients
concerned cannot give informed consent. [Patients must be given the
opportunity to decide for themselves whether they think their lives are
worth living or not. [To ignore]{.mark} or overlook patients'
[judgement]{.mark} in this matter [is to violate]{.mark}]{.underline}
their autonomy and [their freedom to decide for themselves on the basis
of relevant information about their future]{.underline}, and comparative
consideration of their past. [As [the deontological]{.mark} position
puts it]{.underline} so well, [to do so is to violate the
[imperative]{.mark} that [we must treat persons as]{.mark} rational and
as [ends in themselves.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Extinction must precede ethics -- their prioritization of ideology turns value to life and makes extinction inevitable 

**Schell 82** Jonathan, writer for the New Yorker and nuclear weapons
expert, The Fate of the Earth

For the generations that now have to decide whether or not to risk the
future of the species, the implication of our species' unique place in
the order of things is that [[while things in]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[life]{.underline}]{.mark} of mankind [[have worth, we must never raise
that worth above]{.underline}]{.mark} the life of mankind and above
[[our respect for]{.underline}]{.mark} that [life's [existence.]{.mark}
To do this would be to make of our highest ideals so many swords with
which to destroy ourselves. [To sum up the worth of our species by
reference to some particular]{.mark}]{.underline} standard, goal, or
[[ideology]{.mark}, no matter how]{.underline} elevated or
[noble]{.underline} it might be, [[would be to prepare the way for
extinction by closing]{.mark} down in thought and feeling [the
open-ended possibilities for human development]{.mark} which extinction
would close down in fact.]{.underline} There is only one circumstance in
which it might be possible to sum up the life and achievement of the
species, and that circumstance would be that it had already died, but
then, of course, there would be no one left to do the summing up. [Only
a generation that believed itself to be in possession of final, absolute
truth could ever conclude that it had reason to put an end to human
life, and only generations that recognized the limits to their own
wisdom and virtue would be likely to subordinate their interests and
dreams to the as yet unformed interests and undreamed dreams of the
future generations, and let human life go on.]{.underline}

### !/T -- NATO Peace

#### Studies confirm NATO's net violence-reducing -- because of its liberalism

**Recchia 11** Stefano Recchia, Assistant Professor in International
Relations at the University of Cambridge; and Michael Doyle, Professor
of International Affairs, Law and Political Science at Columbia
University; "Liberalism in International Relations," *International
Encyclopedia of Political Science*, eds. Badie, Berg-Schlosser and
Morlino, Sage, 2011, pp.1434-1439 /GoGreen!

Relying on new insights from game theory, [scholars]{.underline} during
the 1980s and 1990s [emphasized that]{.underline} so-called
[international regimes, consisting of agreed-on international norms,
rules, and decision-making procedures, can help states effectively
coordinate their policies and collaborate in the production of
international public goods]{.underline}, such as free trade, arms
control, and environmental protection. [Especially, if embedded in
formal multilateral institutions]{.underline}, such as the World Trade
Organization (WTO) or North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
regimes crucially improve the availability of information among states
in a given issue area, thereby promoting reciprocity and enhancing the
reputational costs of noncompliance. As noted by Robert Keohane,
institutionalized multilateralism also reduces strategic competition
over relative gains and thus further advances international cooperation.
Most international regime theorists accepted Kenneth Waltz\'s (1979)
neorealist assurription of states as black boxes-that is, unitary and
rational actors with given interests. Little or no attention was paid to
the impact on international cooperation of domestic political processes
and dynamics. Likewise, regime scholarship largely disregarded the
arguably crucial question of whether prolonged interaction in an
institutionalized international setting can fundamentally change
states\' interests or preferences over outcomes (as opposed to
preferences over strategies), thus engendering positive feedback loops
of increased overall cooperation. For these reasons, international
regime theory is not, properly speaking, liberal, and the term
neoliberal institutionalism frequently used to identify it is somewhat
misleading. It is only over the past decade or so that [liberal
international relations theorists have begun to [systematic]{.mark}ally
[study]{.mark} the relationship between domestic politics and
institutionalized international cooperation or global
governance]{.underline}. This new scholarship seeks to [[explain]{.mark}
in particular the [close]{.mark} international [cooperation among
liberal democracies as well as]{.mark} higher-than-average levels of
delegation by democracies to complex [multilateral bodies, such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} the European Union (EU), North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**), NAFTA, and the WTO (see,
e.g., John Ikenberry, 2001; Helen Milner & Andrew Moravcsik, 2009). The
reasons that make liberal democracies particularly enthusiastic about
international cooperation are manifold: First, [transnational actors
such as nongovernmental organizations and private corporations thrive in
liberal democracies, and they frequently advocate increased
international cooperation]{.underline}; second, [elected democratic
officials rely on delegation to multilateral bodies]{.underline} such as
the WTO or the EU [to commit to a stable policy line and to
internationally lock in fragile domestic policies and constitutional
arrangements]{.underline}; [and]{.underline} finally, [powerful liberal
democracies, such as [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and]{.mark} its [allies]{.mark},
voluntarily [bind themselves into]{.mark} complex [global
governance]{.mark} arrangements [to demonstrate strategic restraint and
create incentives for other states to cooperate]{.mark}, thereby
reducing the costs for maintaining international order]{.underline}.
[**[Recent scholarship]{.mark}**, such as that of Charles Boehmer and
colleagues, [has]{.mark} also **[confirmed]{.mark}** the classical
liberal intuition [that]{.mark}]{.underline} formal international
institutions, such as the United Nations (UN) or [[**NATO**,
**independently contribute to peace**]{.mark}, especially when they are
endowed with sophisticated administrative structures and
information-gathering capacities]{.underline}. In short, research on
global governance and especially on the relationship between democracy
and international cooperation is thriving, [and]{.underline} it usefully
[complements liberal scholarship on the democratic peace]{.underline}.

### !/T -- Liberal Peace

#### Liberalism is [resilient]{.underline} to the ALT -- and even if imperfect, it's the [most practical way]{.underline} of [organizing power]{.underline} for [radical change]{.underline} -- ALT throws [fifty years]{.underline} of positive change [out the window]{.underline} and only empowers [worse illiberal populists]{.underline}

**Isaac, 18**---James H. Rudy Professor of Political Science at Indiana
University, Bloomington (Jeffrey, "Putting Liberal Democracy First,"
Dissent, Volume 65, Number 2, Spring 2018, pp. 151-159, dml)

Those of us who consider ourselves "left [liberals]{.underline}" [have
expressed particular alarm about the **symbolic** and **practical
dangers** posed by leaders such as]{.underline} Donald [**Trump** and
his **supporters**]{.underline}. To name but a few: mass [rallies
denouncing "the liberal media"; inciting and sometimes enacting violence
against critics or protestors]{.underline}; calling for the imprisonment
of political adversaries; [racist and xenophobic rhetoric]{.underline}
invoked to support Muslim bans, border walls, and mass deportations;
[conspiracy-mongering attacks on career civil servants]{.underline} as
agents of "the deep state," [and]{.underline} on
[journalists]{.underline} as "enem\[ies\] of the American people"; [and
orchestrated campaigns of lying and disinformation]{.underline} under
the banner of speaking "truth" directly to the people and opposing "fake
news." In many ways, [these tactics and actions are **all too
reminiscent** of]{.underline} the "origins of
**[totalitarianism]{.underline}**" discussed by Hannah Arendt in her
1951 classic of that title. To note this is not to deny the profound
differences between the global crises of 1914--1945 and today. But it is
to register profound fear for the future of liberal democracy.

[Colleagues]{.underline} further to my left [have been
**critical**]{.underline}, sometimes harshly, [of this liberal response.
They insist that Trump is **not quite so dangerous**, and that the
dangers he does pose are largely expressions of **deeper tendencies of
neoliberalism** that require **more fundamental challenge**. It thus
makes little sense, they [argue]{.mark}, for the left to reflexively
defend liberal democracy--- [**liberal democracy itself** is the
problem, and]{.mark} the [solution is]{.mark} its
**[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While tactically these
arguments track the 2016 debates between supporters of Hillary Clinton
and Bernie Sanders, they also run deeper. Some on the left---whether
enthusiastic Bernie supporters, or unenthusiastic supporters who
nonetheless saw his candidacy as an opening---reviled Clinton for her
neoliberalism, and could not bring themselves to vote for her even once
she won the Democratic nomination. They argued that the threat posed by
Trump was overstated since both parties are oligarchical and capitalist
(they are), and thus essentially similar (they are not). [This
contingent believed that the real danger is **not Trumpism** but the
corruption, hypocrisy, inequality, and violence **plaguing liberal
democracy itself**]{.underline}.

To be clear, the majority of Sanders supporters did vote for Clinton in
the general election. Moreover, I have no interest in "blaming" people
with such convictions for Clinton's defeat, however they voted (and in a
liberal democracy each individual has the fundamental right to vote as
he or she chooses). Further, many Sanders activists have been involved
in important long-term organizing efforts that are in no way reducible
to the terms of a single election. At the same time, in the debates
about the election and since Trump's inauguration, there have been
serious differences of opinion between those who are greatly alarmed by
Trumpism and who regard the defense of liberal democracy as an urgent
imperative, and those who regard it as nothing more than a symptom of a
deeper and more fundamental crisis. "Socialism or barbarism" is a slogan
rarely heard. But something like it seems to represent the logic of an
anti-liberal position with real traction on the left.

It is important to acknowledge that [what we call "liberal democracy" is
a **complex**, **novel**, **imperfect**, and **ultimately fragile form
of politics**]{.underline}, created after the Second World War [through
an accommodation between liberalism and democracy that was **neither
inevitable nor innocent**]{.underline}. It required the buyin of social
democratic and Christian democratic movements and parties; it relied on
the unique conditions of postwar growth, class compromise, and Cold War
"vital center" anticommunism; and [it **incorporated from the start**
some profoundly illiberal policy commitments]{.underline} ([the
**national security state**, **post-colonial counter-insurgency**, an
**uncritical embrace** of "modernization," and **compromises with
racial** and **gender inequality**, to name a few]{.underline}). [This
regime was **flawed from the start**]{.underline}: it was already in
crisis by 1965, and much of the politics of the past sixty years can be
seen as an intensification of this crisis. Such an arrangement hardly
represents a "riddle of history solved."

[Yet liberal democracy---**[in spite of its corruptions]{.mark}**,
[**failings**, and]{.mark} **complicity with
[injustice]{.mark}**---[represents the **most practical** and
**normatively legitimate way of organizing political power**]{.mark} at
the **level of the nation-state**. And **[every effort to]{.mark}
install [an alternative has resulted in disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Liberal democracy is both **limited** and **precarious**]{.underline}.
And simple appeals to liberal values are insufficient, either to defend
liberal democracy under siege, or to further advance the causes of
social justice and deepen democracy. For this reason, I disagree with
self-identified liberal democrats who regard populism in any form as a
danger to liberal democracy. I would instead agree with those such as
Chantal Mouffe and Étienne Balibar, who argue that [new forms of left
populism and **new left movements** and **parties**]{.underline}
(exemplified by Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, and Demos in
Romania) [are **important** to advance the cause of **social justice**,
to **counter the rise** of right-wing populism, and thus to **defend
liberal democracy itself**.]{.underline}

At the same time, I believe that calls to unambiguously embrace a new
left populism, or to declare one's goal to be socialism (or for some,
even communism) are seriously misguided, at least for those who take
liberal values seriously. There are two reasons why.

The first is broadly political: because [a new]{.underline} socialist or
[left populist hegemony faces **profound** and probably **insuperable
obstacles**, and these are **not gainsaid** by the **obvious failings of
capitalism**]{.underline}. Marx was simply wrong when he declared that
"Mankind thus inevitably sets itself only such tasks as it is able to
solve." And [the fact that capitalism is the **source of profound harm**
to social justice and environmental sustainability **does not mean**
that there is **any obvious way** to "**solve**," rather than **simply
to remedy**, these harms.]{.underline}

In their recent Jacobin piece "Social Democracy Is Good. But Not Good
Enough." Joseph Schwartz and Bhaskar Sunkara take issue with recent
advocacy of liberal versions of socialism. They argue that "history
shows us that achieving a stable welfare state while leaving capital's
power over the economy largely intact is itself far from viable. Even if
we wanted to stop at socialism within capitalism, it's not clear that we
could." But [it is **much less clear** that it is possible to
**institute a [wholesale]{.mark}**]{.underline} socialist
**[[transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And, as Schwartz and Sunkara
themselves concede: "[To chart a different course, we would need a
**militant**]{.underline} labor **[movement]{.underline}** and a mass
socialist presence [strengthened by **accumulated
victories**]{.underline}, looking to not merely tame but overcome
capitalism." But [such a]{.underline} socialist [mass politics is
**[rather unlikely]{.mark}** given the current forms of social and
economic life]{.underline}, which differ dramatically from the forms of
industrialism that gave birth to the modern socialist movement in the
mid-nineteenth century.

"Post-Fordist" forms of flexible accumulation, [automation, neoliberal
forms of consumerism, new digital means of communication]{.underline},
new forms of "liquid modernity"---such developments [have promoted new
forms of inequality, but they have also **eroded** the social, cultural,
and economic bases of working-class formation]{.underline} that grounded
socialist politics in the past. In countries such as the United States,
[there is **no mass proletariat** to mobilize or organize]{.underline}.
And while there is a working class, not many of the individuals
inhabiting this class regard wage-labor as the defining feature of their
experience or identity under capitalism.

In fact, [a range of struggles for recognition now flourish in real
tension with class politics]{.underline}---including civil rights,
women's rights, and gay rights. [[Right-wing populism represents a
**powerful backlash** against these struggles]{.mark} that has
**successfully garnered substantial white working-class support**. The
identities of many members of the white working class are **deeply** and
**profoundly constituted** by sexism and resentment toward immigrants
and people of color in ways that make them **poor targets**]{.underline}
for socialist advocacy.

[It **does not follow** from this that]{.underline} socialist [political
organizing **ought to be disparaged**. But it does follow that left
[liberals have **every reason** to approach the aspiration to
**transcend**]{.mark}]{.underline} capitalism, and [**[liberal
democracy]{.underline}**, [with **skepticism**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.
[And]{.mark} so]{.underline}, when socialist [colleagues challenge us
from the left, insisting that we "**reify**" liberal democracy and fail
to understand the "**real**" sources of our difficulties, we have every
reason to [question **who exactly is doing the
reifying**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The second reason to keep a liberal distance from invocations of
socialist transformation relates to questions of ethical and political
judgment. [[Even if]{.mark} one were to [believe]{.mark} that [the
**only way**]{.mark} to defend liberal democracy and to defeat the
forces of the right [is]{.mark} to **join the struggle** for [a **more
radical challenge**]{.mark}]{.underline} to capitalism itself, [[this
**would not mitigate**]{.mark} **some very [difficult]{.mark}** and
**consequential [political choices]{.mark}** that present themselves in
the here and now]{.underline}.

Thus after Hillary Clinton was nominated, many Sanders supporters who
sincerely believed that something more radical than Clintonism was
necessary were faced with a stark choice: on the one hand, voting for
and supporting Clinton, and, on the other hand, refusing to support
Clinton, by abstaining or supporting Jill Stein, and thus making it more
likely that Donald Trump would be elected. To support Clinton in this
context was not to repudiate Sanders or the importance of the political
"revolution" he led. It was simply to acknowledge that the danger to
liberal democracy represented by Trump was too great---and that
neoliberalism with a human face is always to be preferred to right-wing
authoritarianism. A similar dilemma presented itself to many French
leftists in the May 2017 presidential elections. During the first round,
a number of center and left candidates decided to run, including left
socialist Jean-Luc Mélenchon, along with Marine Le Pen of the right-wing
National Front. But in the runoff, the choice was stark: support
Emmanuel Macron against Le Pen, on the grounds that the danger from the
right must be averted, or refuse to do so, on the grounds that Macron is
a neoliberal. Yanis Varoufakis, self-described "erratic Marxist" and
former Greek Finance Minister, explained the stakes in Project
Syndicate: Progressives have good reason to be angry with a liberal
establishment that feels comfortable with Macron. . . . Moreover, it is
not hard to identify with the French left's feeling that the liberal
establishment is getting its comeuppance with Le Pen's rise. . . . But
the decision of many leftists to maintain an equal distance between
Macron and Le Pen is inexcusable. There are two reasons for this. First,
the imperative to oppose racism trumps opposition to neoliberal
policies. . . . Just like in the 1940s, we have a duty to ensure that
the state's monopoly over the legitimate use of violence is not
controlled by those who harbor violent sentiments toward the foreigner,
the cultural or sexual minority member, the "other." . . . But there is
a second reason for backing Macron. . . . My disagreements with Macron
are legion. . . . \[yet\] I support Macron . . . \[for I\] refuse to be
part of a generation of leftists responsible for allowing a fascist and
racist to win the French presidency. Naturally, if Macron wins and
becomes merely another functionary of Europe's deep establishment, my
comrades and I will oppose him no less energetically than we are---or
should be---opposing Le Pen now.

Yet [there are those on the left who view the neoliberal as **no less of
a threat** than the neo-fascist]{.underline}. The philosopher Slavoj
**[Žižek]{.underline}**, for example, [**refused to support Macron
against Le Pen**, echoing a stance he had taken in the **Clinton-Trump
contest**]{.underline}. Similar sentiments have been expressed by the
scholar Nancy Fraser, a harsh critic of Clinton. Like Žižek, [**Fraser**
insists]{.underline} that "far from being the antidote to fascism,
(neo)liberalism is its partner in crime. . . . [the left should **refuse
the [choice]{.mark}** [between **progressive neolib**]{.mark}eralism
[and **reactionary populism**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[But there are times when **such a choice [is necessary]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} making the right choice is [**not a form of capitulation**
but **political responsibility**]{.mark}. The making of such a choice
**[does not preclude other choices as well]{.mark}**, and it [**makes
perfect sense** to say "I **support this**]{.mark}]{.underline}
candidate or [[**policy now**, when the alternative is **much
worse**]{.mark}, **[at the same time]{.mark}** that I [will **continue
to work** for a future in which **better choices are
available**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

And so on May 15, 2017, shortly after Macron's victory, Varoufakis, as
promised, published a follow-up: "Congratulations, President
Macron---Now We Oppose You." [There **may be a vantage point** from
which it makes sense to]{.underline} denounce Varoufakis for refusing to
[**refuse the choice** between "progressive neoliberalism and
reactionary populism." But it is a vantage point from which the **fate
of liberal democracy**, with its **civil liberties**, **ethnic** and
**religious tolerance**, and **political pluralism**---and the fate of
those constituencies who **need these very things to survive**---would
seem to **matter all too little**]{.underline}. As Varoufakis stated in
another op-ed for Le Monde, "Of course we all wish, at least those of us
on the left, that the French electoral system were not binary. But it
is. And given that it is, I refuse to be part of a generation of
European progressives who could have stopped Marine Le Pen from winning
France's Presidency but didn't." [Varoufakis describes the refusal of
this choice as "**scandalous**." To choose against right-wing
authoritarianism is to **put liberal democracy first**, and to treat it
**not as the end**, but as an **essential means of any ends worth
pursuing**]{.underline}.

The questions of means and ends raised by such electoral choices are
even more pressing when it comes to another set of tactics supported by
some on the left---tactics of sometimes violent direct action
represented by antifa. Natasha Lennard explained in the Nation last
August that "the antifascist project is not one of asking for better
statutes or a reconfiguration of rights. . . . antifa is a promise to
neo-Nazis and their bedfellows that we will confront them in the
streets; we will expose them online and inform their place of employ."
She makes clear that such a politics has little regard for the discourse
of human rights or the rule of law. Last summer, Lennard also pursued
this anti-liberal theme in Dissent: Time and again in recent months I
have seen political writers apoplectic over alleged rips in the social
contract, as wrought by Trump, anti-immigrant policy, or austerity, or
any number of political plagues. The liberal response has been outrage
and disbelief that the state can fall so far from its alleged foundation
as a contract forged by the will of equal pledgers. . . . Calling upon
some mythic social contract to deliver us from evil is not just futile,
it's downright religious, as Nietzsche would see it. Liberal outrage
peddles Christian morality in a world where God is dead, and we have
killed him. . . . Power determines which narratives about reality get to
count as truth. Recognizing this is a political necessity for those who
would challenge the Trumpian Weltanschauung." Antifa historian and
organizer Mark Bray similarly writes that "anti-fascism is an illiberal
politics of social revolutionism applied to fighting the Far Right, not
only literal fascists \[emphasis added\]." The roots of antifa lie in
the most radical forms of anarchism. As the journalist Chris Hedges (and
also Noam Chomsky) have argued, "The focus on street violence diverts
activists from the far less glamorous building of relationships and
alternative institutions and community organizing that alone will make
effective resistance possible." Moreover, antifa rhetoric, like the "alt
right" and neo-Nazi rhetoric it despises, is Manichean. Instead of
efforts to forge broad coalitions capable of defeating right-wing
authoritarians at the ballot box, antifa tactics promote cycles of
recrimination, giving public credibility to right-wing authoritarians,
such as Trump, who valorize police brutality and claim to represent "law
and order." There is a long history of Manichean "friend/enemy" thinking
on the left, represented by polemics such as Lenin's 1918 "The
Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky" and Trotsky's 1938
Their Morals and Ours. It was, in part, to counter such thinking that
Dissent magazine was founded. That generation of democratic socialists,
shaken by the experiences of Stalinism, totalitarianism, genocide, and
world war, and hemmed in by McCarthyism and what Irving Howe called a
deadening "age of conformity," created a journal committed to a critical
and liberal version of socialism centering on the importance of vigorous
disagreement. In its sixty-four years, Dissent has experienced
generational changes and featured many important debates. But at no time
since the journal's founding has the very existence of liberal democracy
seemed more in danger.

[The **[illiberal forces]{.mark}** on the rise [threaten to **reverse
every important achievement**, **however limited**, of the **past five
decades**]{.mark} of liberal democracy. These achievements include
**reproductive freedom** and **domestic violence legislation**;
**environmental** and **workplace health** and **safety regulation**;
**civil rights** and **voting rights enforcement**; moderate forms of
**consumer protection**; and **press freedom** and **protection against
censorship**. All **deserve to be defended**, **not** because of their
role in advancing us toward a **future beyond capitalism**, but because
they **represent real improvements** in our lives. The
**fear-mongering**, **repression**, and **evisceration of public
criticism** promoted by right-wing populism **diminish democratic
citizenship for everyone**. They are **harmful to left organizing** and
to anyone who believes in defending political freedom. Resisting these
assaults on liberal democracy through the **political means made
available by liberal democracy** is an **urgent task**. This **does not
prevent one from also seeking to build a movement** beyond "resistance."
But resistance is **important work in its own right** and, for
many]{.underline} of us, [it is the work that is **currently most
important**]{.underline}.

Sarah Leonard, a Dissent editor-at-large and former editor at the
Nation, recently remarked about the uncertainties of liberals: The
problem with many prominent representatives of liberalism today . . . is
that they don't seem to know which side they're on. Say Bernie, vote
Hillary; say universal health care, but condemn its advocacy; say
electable, lose everywhere; say you'll don sneakers to walk the picket
line, don't show up. The name of my desire is socialism; do liberals
know the name of theirs? This reluctance to pick "a side" that disturbs
Leonard---which I prefer to describe as ambivalence---is real, and while
it can be bridged, I doubt it can be eliminated. For to be a left
liberal is to be troubled by the hesitations and inconsistencies of
which Leonard writes but also to believe that a pluralistic politics of
freedom in our complex world requires such tribulations. I supported
Sanders and voted for him in the Indiana primary. But I doubted he could
win the Democratic nomination, much less the general election, and I
worried about the harshness with which some of his supporters attacked
Clinton, a harshness that has persisted over the past year. I support
universal healthcare, and welcome the shift by many important Democratic
leaders to support the Sanders plan. Still, I wonder whether the plan
itself is viable, and whether it is the most compelling issue on which
to mobilize the Democratic Party to electoral victories in 2018 and
2020. Because I so profoundly fear Trumpism, I regard Democratic
victories as critical---even if they involve compromises on healthcare
and even as they will likely bring disappointments. Am I confused? Am I
lacking in conviction? Or am I simply unable to believe there are easy,
clear-cut answers to many current political questions?

And so ["liberal" works]{.underline} for me [as a **political
identity**]{.underline} in a way that "socialist" does not. [It **places
a priority** on the civil and political freedoms that **make it possible
for us to argue** about how to challenge injustice and work for greater
justice. It furnishes **peaceful channels of political participation**
and **contestation** that allow for **provisional agreements to be
reached** about how to move forward]{.underline}.

Again, Lennard writes, disparagingly, that: "The liberal response has
been outrage and disbelief that the state can fall so far from its
alleged foundation as a contract forged by the will of equal pledgers."
But [liberals]{.underline} such as myself [**do not believe** that the
liberal democratic state was **ever founded** through an **idyllic
process** of egalitarian consent. We believe **only** that liberal
democracy is a **flawed outcome of struggle worth defending**, and that
the idea of free and equal democratic will formation has **furnished**,
and **continues to furnish**, a **powerful normative ideal**. There is
no "mythic social contract" that can "deliver us from
evil."]{.underline} There is no such contract, and there is no such
deliverance. [There is **only ongoing debate** and
**contestation**.]{.underline}

It is perhaps [that **fundamental commitment** to **ongoing political
contestation**]{.underline} that marks the difference between left
liberals and those to our left who embrace a more "radical" and often
emphatically socialist politics. To note this is not to disparage those
to my left. It [is to identify **points of honest difference** as well
as **commonalities**, on which **agreements** and **alliances are
possible**]{.underline}.

In December 2001, Robert Kuttner published a short piece in the liberal
journal he co-edits, the American Prospect, with the self-explanatory
title "Why Liberals Need Radicals." In June 2013, Bhaskar Sunkara,
editor of Jacobin, published a piece in the Nation, entitled "Letter to
'The Nation' From a Young Radical." Sunkara explains why he and his
colleagues have embraced a new radicalism with strong Marxist roots. He
too makes the case that [liberals and radicals **need each
other**]{.underline}. At the same time, from the radical and not the
liberal side, Sunkara's view of this association is rather harsh:
"American radicalism has had a complex and at times contradictory
association with liberalism. At the peak of the socialist movement,
[leftists **fed off liberal victories**. Radicals]{.underline}, in turn,
[have **added coherence** and **punch** to **every key liberal
struggle** and **advance** of the past century. Such a **mutually
beneficial alliance** could be in the works again.]{.underline} The
first step is to smash the existing liberal coalition and rebuild it on
a radically different basis."

I share Sunkara's belief that now is the time for mutually beneficial
connections and alliances between democratic socialists and liberals.
But [I am]{.underline} rather **[wary]{.underline}**---perhaps for
reasons of generational experience---[of calls to "**smash the existing
liberal coalition**."]{.underline} I am skeptical of that "radically
different basis." Most importantly, I believe that [[the **danger posed
by the radical right**, to]{.mark} the **political conditions** and
**elemental life chances of [many millions]{.mark} of individuals**,
[makes it important to **defend**]{.mark}, to **build**, [and]{.mark} to
[**extend the liberal coalition** rather than **disrupt** or **destroy
it**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because in the struggle between socialism and
barbarism, it is barbarism that has the advantage. And because [the
**civil** and **political freedoms** and forms of **responsive public
policy** made possible by liberal democracy are a **necessary condition
of any social** or **economic justice worth having**]{.underline}.

#### Ks of lib-ism link to themselves by dismissing post-colonial liberal perspectives and the [concrete needs]{.underline} of colonial subjects---rejecting lib-ism [all too easily]{.underline} feeds into the [growing wave]{.underline} of global fascism

**Claudio, 19**---Associate Professor at De La Salle University
Manila\'s College of Liberal Arts (Lisandro, "Conclusion: Resurrecting
Plants," *Jose Rizal: Liberalism and the Paradox of Coloniality*, 71-77,
SpringerLink, dml)

[Too often, with liberalism, we **throw the baby out with the
bathwater**]{.underline}. In contemporary critical and cultural theory,
criticisms of liberalism are almost mandatory. This is most true in the
field of postcolonial theory or in philosophies of the Global South.
[For many postcolonial scholars, "western" liberalism is the **common
enemy** of the politics and ideas from the margins of global knowledge
production]{.underline}. At times, one may be led to think that, without
liberalism as a common target, postcolonial theory would lose its
cohesion. Postcolonies are, after all, different, and the philosophies
their intellectuals have espoused have likewise been varied. Without a
positive notion of theory from the Global South, scholars have turned to
denigrating "liberal" modernity.1

Of course, [some anti-liberal scholarship has **surfaced dark legacies**
of the European tradition. But even these **turn critique into blanket
dismissal**]{.underline}. For example, the scathing work of Uday Singh
Mehta (1999) proves how British liberal intellectuals like Jeremy
Benthan, James and John Stuart Mill, and Lord Macaulay defended
imperialism, particularly in India. The idea of Western tutelage for
"backward" societies, he contends, stems from the liberal embrace of
universal values to the exclusion of different cultures and belief
systems. Hence, "the liberal involvement with the British Empire is
broadly coeval with liberalism itself" (ibid., 4). Echoing Mehta, the
sociologist Julian Go (2017, 74) contends that "civic-liberal nations"
are "empire-states" (emphasis in original) because they "are predicated
upon a core hierarchized binary of citizen and Other---that is, between
those who are members of the community because they are rational,
mature, and civilized, and those who are not."

[These scholars are **sympathetic to the concerns** of postcolonies and
the Global South. But they have **unwittingly wedded themselves** to the
study of the **Global North**. In studying liberalism, they **privilege
the voices of liberals from Europe**, while **neglecting** how
liberalism has been **articulated in postcolonies themselves**. A global
history of liberalism **must acknowledge the contributions of colonial
thinkers** in its development]{.underline}. True enough, we may condemn
thinkers like Mill for their defense of imperialism, but we must also
celebrate their counterpoints from within the liberal tradition. We must
celebrate thinkers like Rizal.

Rizal would have accepted many of the objections of scholars like Mehta
and Go. He too knew how [liberals]{.underline} from colonial metropoles
[**could use their ideas to support colonialism**. But]{.underline}
Rizal would have **[reject]{.underline}**ed [the **reduction of
liberalism's vast history** to the **actions of
colonizers**]{.underline}. In this book, I hope to have shown that,
while Rizal criticized Spanish liberals, he never abandoned the liberal
project. Rather, he believed that [liberalism could be **renewed**, even
**purified**, in the colony]{.underline}, through the painful
experiences of colonials like himself.

Rizal too would not have dismissed liberalism simply because it could
create "Others." For he knew that [any political community **needs to
have an inside** and an **outside**: nations have foreigners, religions
have non-believers, and socialist movements have class
enemies]{.underline}. In this regard, [liberalism is **no different**
from other political ideals that form bonds of community]{.underline}.
Rizal knew, however, that the bonds of community within liberal
republics could be expansive and cosmopolitan. He saw how the category
"Filipino" could expand from only referring to creoles to include all
those who identified with the emergent nation. He believed in
communities not bound by race or religion, but adherence to
Enlightenment philosophy.

[Such a worldview]{.underline} is simple, but it [comes to us with a
**certain urgency** today, at a time when "**illiberal democracy**" is
on]{.underline}e [the rise]{.underline}. For much of the post-Cold War
world, [progressive and radical thinkers insisted]{.underline} that
there was more to human political development than the mere liberal "end
of history." [There **had to be more radical ways** to imagining
politics. Amid this desire, much anti-liberal thinking became
**nihilistic**, and those who condemned liberalism **rarely thought of
concrete alternatives**]{.underline}. At worse, [they denigrated the
basic tenets of liberalism, **without care for the possible
repercussions**]{.underline}.

The disillusionment with liberalism is, of course, nothing new. Even as
Rizal was articulating a liberalism for the colonized in the nineteenth
century, many Europeans were already becoming sick of the liberal
project. Francois Furet (2000, 11) explains that many radicals from that
period had come to believe "that modern liberal democracy was
threatening society with dissolution because it atomized individuals,
made them indifferent to public interest, weakened authority, and
encouraged class hatred." This disillusionment would eventually lead to
the twin illiberal philosophies that dominated the twentieth century:
fascism on the right and Communism on the Left.

History, of course, does not repeat itself. But [there are **echoes of
the illiberal early twentieth century today**]{.underline}. If [the
present moment prompts comparisons with the 1930s and
1940s]{.underline}, it is not because we are about to enter another
period of global warfare. Rather, it is [because]{.underline}, [our
present]{.underline}, like those years, **[teems with
illiberalism]{.underline}**. And, [like the early twentieth century,
intellectuals]{.underline} in the West [have been **averse to defending
liberal values**, preferring instead **utopian visions of politics**
that can **neither be tested nor implemented**]{.underline}. For much of
the twentieth century, as Hollander (2016) explains, [the illiberalism
of intellectuals was evident in the **hero worship of dictators** in
places like Germany, China, Cuba, the Soviet Union, Cambodia, and
Venezuela. Western intellectuals looked to strongmen on both the left
and the right as **figures of inspiration** because of a "**painful
awareness** of the inability of Western, pluralistic, capitalist
societies to deliver sustaining values and beliefs that would enable
them to confront and weather the endemic crises and frustrations of
life]{.underline}, and especially modern life" (ibid., 294).

[These same frustrations not only led]{.underline} Western
[intellectuals to **admire dictators**; they also brought them to
**nihilistic positions against**]{.underline} Enlightenment traditions
like [**liberalism**. The **identification with authoritarian figures**
and the **rejection of "Western liberalism"** are impulses
of]{.underline} what Pascal Bruckner (2010, 21) calls [a masochistic
"penitential class," who, because of their **guilt about colonialism**,
**turn their back** on the values of the Enlightenment. Today, radical
scholars from the Global North seek to theorize the Global South **in
opposition to a static**, **liberal North/West**. Some are **so
cavalier** that they dismiss even the **most humane of Enlightenment
traditions** such as **human rights**]{.underline}. For example, Jean
and John Comaroff (2001, 39--40), purveyors of "theory from the south,"
diminish the value of human rights by comparing rights-based thinking to
contemporary capitalism, contending that "If law underpins the langue of
neoliberalism, constitutionalism has become the parole of universal
human rights, a global argot that individuates the citizen and, by
making cultural identity a private asset, rather than a collective
claim, transmutes difference into likeness."

[Such]{.underline} purple [prose is **merely academese** for the **tired
argument** that individualistic human rights are **incompatible with
collectivist societies**]{.underline}. In fact, [the same argument was
**better phrased** by]{.underline} the spokesperson of the authoritarian
Philippine president Rodrigo **[Duterte]{.underline}**, when he was
justifying the murder of thousands of drug suspects. "The liberal
Western values being imposed upon an Asian nation that places premium on
common good," he argued, "is both insensitive and displays a lack of
appreciation for the diversity of global culture" (Quoted in Esmaquel
2017). [Western intellectuals **do not always directly endorse
demagogues**, but they are **tempted by cool detachment to speak like
them**]{.underline}.

Hollander (2016, 9) contends that many pro-dictatorship intellectuals
endorsed authoritarianism from a distance, and many of them "had little
to gain, or lose" in their judgments. Until today, [many illiberal
commentators on the Global South from the Global North do so from **far
away**, **secure** that constitutional rights **do not collapse
overnight**]{.underline} in places like the United States or
Europe---Donald Trump and the European far-right notwithstanding.
[Unfortunately, for those of us in places like the Philippines, a human
rights regime **may disintegrate overnight**]{.underline}, as in the
case of Duterte's Philippines. Rizal's country was once a broken, if
relatively stable, liberal democracy. After the collapse of Ferdinand
Marcos's dictatorship in 1986, it slowly inched its way toward some
semblance of a liberal democracy, where regular elections occurred,
civil society movements focused on institution building, and relatively
open elections occurred (Quimpo 2008; Curato 2015; Thompson 1996). In
2016, the country was taken over by a murderous demagogue.

This collapse of liberal democracy occurs amid thunderous applause, with
Duterte remaining popular despite a drug war that has killed thousands.
Because Duterte has devalued his country's human rights tradition---"If
it concern human rights, I don't give a shit"---he once claimed (Quoted
in Holmes 2016)---he has also devalued life. Survey data shows that the
majority of Filipinos believe that extra-judicial killings are occurring
under the drug war, yet a significant majority remain supportive of the
government's draconian campaign (Pulse Asia Research Inc. 2017). Such is
the moral crisis that Duterte has created.

When Rizal argued that pain purified liberalism, he was expressing a
profound but obvious insight: Those who have had liberty denied them
value it even more. Those who believe that liberty may slip away are
more cautious in their criticisms of basic freedoms. For a liberal in
the Philippines, the truth of this message can be found in the most
quotidian contexts. Many liberals in my country have had to fight for
liberal values in religious schools, patriarchal families, and other
conservative institutions. Under Duterte , they fight amid an electorate
that is increasingly proving susceptible to the temptations of
authoritarianism. It is an everyday struggle for everyday changes.

[Liberalism continues to be **pragmatic**. It is pragmatic for those who
see the **concrete needs of postcolonies**]{.underline}, for thinkers
like Rizal [who seek **evolving modernities**]{.underline} for their
nations. For Nigerian philosopher Olúfẹmi Táíwò (2014, 10), [seeking
these]{.underline} modernities [requires being **less concerned with the
provenance of ideas** and **more with their usefulness**]{.underline}.
He contends "that [the countries of Asia and Latin America that have
**transformed themselves for the better** are precisely the ones that
have **wised up to the idea** that---regardless of what they think of
modernity and the West]{.underline}, which has most benefited from its
proliferation---[a **good way to improve their lot** in the world is to
**borrow some pages from the West's playbook**]{.underline}."

[While liberalism is an **inadequate philosophy**---it constantly has to
grapple with its bourgeois origins---many of its principles are
**necessary checks** against the **excesses of political power**. The
**fault of liberalism's critics** has been to view it as an **ends in
itself** instead of a **system of guarantees**, a **bare minimum** of
treating citizens]{.underline} in a political community
[with]{.underline} what Orwell called "**[common
decency]{.underline}**." The history of liberalism has shown how [many
ideas can be **grafted onto the liberal project**. Social
democracy]{.underline}, for example, [represented liberalism coming to
terms with class inequality.]{.underline} And, indeed, as Tony Judt
(2010, 52) has argued, it was the welfare that bound citizens to the
state's liberal institutions.

[Liberalism **grows**. Liberal America **once had slaves**. Liberal
countries from across the world **refused women the right to vote**. And
many liberal states **once had colonies**, which they exploited. But
**because of anti-colonial liberals**]{.underline} like Rizal, [we now
**recognize colonialism** as a **contradiction of the liberal project**.
This recognition is a **gift of the Enlightenment**]{.underline}, and
someone like Rizal had no qualms about appropriating what he saw in
Europe, and grafting them into colonial contexts. He would have agreed
with Bruckner (2010, 28) who contends that "[There is **no doubt** that
Europe has **given birth to monsters**, but **at the same time** it has
given birth to theories that **make it possible to understand** and
**destroy these monsters**]{.underline}."

[The rise of global populism and authoritarianism means we **can no
longer dismiss liberal principles as lightly**, since anti-liberalism
**feeds into the rhetoric of present-day dictators**]{.underline}. The
Philippine liberal tradition runs deep, but it is always in a precarious
position, especially now. [For those of us who seek comfort amid the
tribulations of the present, we may return to]{.underline} Rizal's
enigmatic [vision of liberalism being a "**plant that never dies**." The

its seeds** and **await its resurrection**]{.underline}.

#### Abdicating a defense of lib-ism's self-correcting capacities leaves the vacuum open for authoritarianism while removing any checks on its rise

In all the criticisms cited above, [critics **reduce liberalism to a
static idea**, holding it up to the **most stringent
criteria**]{.underline}, which are not equally applied to other existing
political models. (To muster such vitriol against Marxism would
certainly elicit accusations of fascistic anti-Communism). [But **any
nuanced history** of liberal thought must acknowledge the **steady
expansion** of liberalism's political and ethical horizons]{.underline}.
Edmund Fawcett, for example, has shown how [liberalism, which began as a
credo of the elites]{.underline} (liberty for a select few) [grew into
liberal democracy in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and thus
became a **grammar for mass politics**]{.underline} (2014, 143). Thus,
[while]{.underline} we may concede that [liberal ideas have **previously
marginalized women**, the **poor**, and **various racial others**, we
must also note its **historical capacity for self-correction**.
Scholars]{.underline} like Mehta or Go [are **quick to point out
liberalism's sins** but **neglect how relatively quickly** some of these
sins were rectified]{.underline}.

Liberalism's expansiveness is present even in the US-based
civic-liberalism that scholars like Go deride. For, as Richard Rorty
reminds us, while the United States has had a history of subjugation and
hypocrisy, its greatest minds, such as Walt Whitman and John Dewey,
constantly infused their critiques with a vision of what a more
inclusive US society could be in the future (1997, 8). [The liberal
experiment, **always in the process of becoming**, was premised on
"**replacing shared knowledge** of what is already real with **social
hope** for what might become real"]{.underline} (18). [Liberalism is an
idea **centered on progress**, and progress **assumes that mistakes were
once made**. Otherwise, **what are we to progress from**?]{.underline}

[Much of anti-liberal postcolonial theorization is built on]{.underline}
straw men [\[**straw persons**\], based on **incomplete histories** of
both Northern and Southern liberalisms, and on assumptions about
political models that **have not** or **cannot be tested**]{.underline}.
More importantly, [these critiques **do not seriously consider their
implications** in the Global South, where problems like poverty and
violence are **immediate** and **pressing**, making **ameliorative
reform more urgent**]{.underline}. Moreover, [the **institutional
blueprint** of a liberal democracy is **necessary** to maintain a
**baseline of politics** that prevents the **excesses of
authoritarianism** and the **ethical relativism that enables
it**]{.underline}. As Dipesh Chakrabarty prosaically yet correctly
concedes, ["we do not in modernity and as yet, know of **desirable
institutional arrangements** in public life that could be **seriously
built** on principles **other than those of liberalism**"]{.underline}
(emphasis in original, 2001, 126). [When those desirable institutional
arrangements **collapse**, polities enter periods of **violent crisis**.
This is currently happening in the **Philippines**]{.underline}.

Duterte and the Attack on the Liberal State

[Anti-liberalism in aid of authoritarianism has a **long tradition** in
Asia. Pitting "Asian" communal values against Western individualism has
served to justify **various repressive measures**, from **racist
bumiputra laws** in Malaysia to **press censorship** in
Singapore]{.underline}. In India, the communalist rhetoric of the Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party) positions itself against
the "foreign" liberalism of intellectuals. For this final section, I
want to examine how [this same rhetoric has been reproduced in the
Philippines by]{.underline} the populist strongman Rodrigo [**Duterte**,
who has not only prosecuted a bloody war on drugs, but has also
**denigrated** and **weakened the liberal democratic institutions** of
his country]{.underline}.

As we saw earlier, [the anti-colonial liberalism of figures like Rizal
**birthed the Philippine nation**. The prominence of liberal
intellectuals continued throughout the American colonial period and the
postwar period of independence. Educators pushed for pedagogy that was
**informed by**]{.underline} John Dewey's **[liberal
internationalism]{.underline}** (Claudio 2015a), [diplomats were
**integral** to the formation of a global human rights architecture at
the United Nations]{.underline} (Claudio 2015b), [and economic debates
were **centered on the liberal management** of an export
industry]{.underline} (Claudio 2017, 45--71). [For many Filipinos, the
claim that their country represented the success of a US-style liberal
democracy in Asia was **more than postcolonial lip
service**.]{.underline}

The country's liberal experiment ground to a halt in 1972, when
President Ferdinand Marcos implemented martial law to perpetuate himself
in power. The dictator padlocked congress, arrested activists and
opposition leaders, and shut down what many considered the freest press
in Asia. Marcos's downfall in 1986 restored liberal democracy, but this
restored democracy was fragile. Thirty years after the fall of Marcos,
another budding dictator has emerged to challenge the country's liberal
tradition. As a candidate in 2016, Rodrigo Duterte ran on a wave of
popular disillusionment with the liberal reformism of his predecessor,
Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III (2010--2016)---son of former president
Corazon Aquino (1988-- 1992) and martyred anti-Marcos opposition senator
Benigno Aquino Jr. Though President Aquino and his Liberal Party were
consistently popular for the majority of his six-year term, a
congressional corruption scandal and a botched military operation dented
the president's reputation during his final years in office. Moreover,
quotidian problems such as worsening traffic in the already gridlocked
Metropolitan Manila area raised frustration with government.

[Duterte]{.underline} emerged seemingly out of nowhere, a little-known
mayor from the southern city of Davao. Commentators thought he would
fail to compete with the popularity and machinery of the three leading
mainstream candidates, which included the daughter of the country's most
famous action star, the incumbent vice president, and Aquino's interior
secretary. Duterte's rise was first a blip that became unstoppable, and
it caught Filipino pundits off guard. Yet his campaign [tapped into
multiple dormant impulses]{.underline} in the electorate:
[**authoritarian nostalgia**, a **disdain for**]{.underline}
Manila-based [**politicians**, and **impatience with
reformism**]{.underline}. His campaign tagline, "change is coming," as
Anne Applebaum correctly notes, had "the same empty appeal as 'make
American great again'" (2016). [Like]{.underline} the United States'
Donald [Trump]{.underline}, [it was this **emptiness**, couched in
**unbridled anger**, which turned Duterte into an **empty canvas** for
various forms of disaffection]{.underline}.7

From the fall of the Marcos in 1986 to Duterte's assumption of power,
the Philippines had been involved in a slow if uneven process of
redemocratization. Within this period, memories of the bloodless EDSA
"People Power" revolution that unseated Marcos became the organizing
mnemonic template of the post-Marcos state.8 Its heroes, particularly
Corazon Aquino (widow of a slain opposition senator and Marcos's
successor), became enshrined as the secular saints of the
post-authoritarian republic in a Manichean divide that separated the
forces of democracy and those of the dictatorship (Claudio 2013). During
this period, the country developed a robust, grassroots democratic
culture---largely a product of the various civil society organizations
that emerged from the ashes of the anti-Marcos opposition. Despite the
vibrancy of what political scientist Nathan Quimpo labeled the
Philippine "contested democracy,"---led by a free-flowing, non-Communist
Left---certain problems remained intractable (2008). In particular,
violent political dynasties and local machine politicians continued to
dominate regional politics. As Benedict Anderson explains, the end of
the Marcos regime may have ended authoritarianism, but it brought back
the system of oligarch-led "cacique democracy" (1998). Many voters and
commentators saw Duterte as a cure to the dominance of the oligarchs.
That Duterte himself came from a local oligarchic background became
irrelevant. His anti-elitism manifested in a rough-talking rhetorical
style that separated him from the cultivated candidates of the
"establishment." The violence began even before Duterte took office,
with drug-related vigilante killings spiking mere days after the
election. As president, Duterte has overseen the bloodiest display of
state power in Philippine history. Conservative estimates place the
death toll at 7,000 as of August 2017 (Kine 2017). Although there are no
accurate statistics for the death toll under Marcos (the mass killings
occurred in remote provinces), the velocity of killing under Duterte is
unprecedented. Beyond the violence, Duterte has also poisoned public
discourse and damaged political institutions. Apart from destroying the
reputation of Aquino's Liberal Party, he has also challenged the
country's liberal tradition by glorifying the late dictator Marcos,
whose remains the president buried in the country's hero's cemetery. As
with most populists, it is sometimes difficult to determine what Duterte
stands for. It is clear, however, what he is against. For Duterte, notes
Walden Bello, "the target is liberal-democracy---the dominant ideology
and political system of our time" (2017, np). Much like Trump and
Vladimir Putin, Duterte's propaganda machinery relies heavily on
networks of social media trolls who share fake news and promote
conspiracy theories. A primary target of trolling operations and
presidential pronouncements has been the beleaguered Commission on Human
Rights (CHR), an independent constitutional body that seeks to
investigate the state's alleged human rights violations. In late 2017,
the Duterte-controlled House of Representatives (the lower house) voted
to allocate a mere P1,000 Philippine pesos (20 USD) for its annual
budget, a stunt celebrated by Duterte's online supporters (Cupin 2017).
Though the defunding was soon corrected by a more circumspect Senate
(upper house), it sent a message that the liberal constitutional
framework of the Philippines was collapsing with thunderous applause.
Duterte and his allies represent institutions that promote human rights
as hindrances to the president's mission of national renewal. When the
United Nations special rapporteur on summary executions requested to
investigate the killings, Duterte's government rejected the offer. The
president's spokesperson justified the decision by claiming that the UN
was seeking to impose "liberal Western values" on "an Asian nation that
places premium on common good" The UN was, he concluded, "both
insensitive and display\[ed\] a lack of appreciation for the diversity
of global culture" (quoted in Esmaquel 2017, np). Always more pithy,
Duterte himself claimed that, "if it involves human rights, I don't give
a shit" (quoted in Holmes 2016, np).

Alas, Duterte's rhetoric has worked. Into his second year in office, the
President enjoys over 80% approval rating ("Pulse: Duterte\..." 2017),
largely from a population that does not care how many die as long as it
does not affect them. [The triumph of]{.underline} what commentators
have called "**[Dutertismo]{.underline}**" is complete, and it [proves
that there are, indeed, **alternatives to liberal politics**. Whether
these alternatives are **desirable** is a **different
matter**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[Global liberalism is in **crisis**. Duterte's rise in the Philippines
is just one example of the illiberal, populist backlash triggered by
multiple causes]{.underline}, including the inequalities of economic
globalization, the smugness of the liberal elite, and the appeal of
strongman rule.

[It would be]{.underline} extreme and certainly [false to claim that
anti-liberal postcolonial theory]{.underline} or theory from the South
[**caused** or even **contributed** to the rise of global populism.
Doing so would **confuse the symptom for the cause**. Yet we must also
**hold intellectuals to task** for **failing to rise to the defense** of
basic common principles **anchored on liberal ideals** of dignity,
tolerance, human rights, and, yes, a certain degree of
universalism]{.underline}. For the historian Tony Judt (1988), [what is
**necessary** is a **renewed moralism** in intellectual life---the
responsibility to **confront political excesses** and **intellectual
flights of fancy**. Such an approach would **temper**]{.underline} the
[**cynicism**, **cool detachment**, and **disdain for the
Enlightenment**]{.underline} that defines much writing on the Global
South.

The [anti-liberal theorizing]{.underline} on the Global South [by
scholars working in the Global North may be a **safe exhaust valve** for
their frustrations and boredom with the liberal democracy they
experience every day]{.underline}. Trump notwithstanding, [liberal
institutions are stronger in places like the United States and Europe
and can therefore be **taken for granted**]{.underline}, even maligned.
[But the same **cannot be said of the Global South**, where liberal
democratic institutions can **collapse almost overnight**, as they have
in Duterte's Philippines]{.underline}. To put things in blunt and
moralistic terms: [my president is **slaughtering my countrymen by the
thousands**, justifying the murders by **dismissing liberalism** and
human rights as "**Western**." I **do not have the luxury** of
"**problematizing**" human rights as **symptomatic** of the era of
"**neoliberalism**." Scholars **should be careful of the illiberalism
they wish for** in the Global North, because we in the Global South
**just might get it** in the form of a **bloodthirsty
autocrat**]{.underline}.

[A **restoration of liberal democratic principles**]{.underline} in my
country [is]{.underline} urgent---[a **matter of life** and **death**.
And it is with this sense of urgency that we must **rethink
liberalism**]{.underline} in the Global South, [**not as an endpoint**
of political development]{.underline} ("end of history"), [but as the
**bare minimum** of democratic politics]{.underline}. A
[liberalism]{.underline} for the Global South [must be **simultaneously
anchored on realism** and **hopefulness**. A moralist's liberal stance
must be anchored on]{.underline}, to corrupt what Gramsci said for
Marxist ends, [a **pessimism of the intellect** conjoined with an
**optimism of the will**. Except, since liberalism **refuses to
foreground a revolutionary break** along the horizon, it **leaves more
room for optimism**]{.underline}. As modus vivendi, [liberalism **has no
telos**; it is **never fully complete**. Hence it is **never fully a
success** or a **failure**]{.underline}.

[The Global South, like liberalism, is a **provisional** and **syncretic
project**, built on **imagined networks of solidarity** yet anchored on
the **necessity of everyday political praxis**. They are both **open**,
because they are both in **perennial translation**]{.underline}. As
Arjun Appadurai contends, [it is in liberalism that we find **seeds of
cosmopolitanism**, because it is premised on
"self-expansion"]{.underline} (2005, 434). [This self-expansion may lead
us into **new theoretical horizons**]{.underline} (even new forms of
socialism), [but it will remain anchored on basic principles: the
**respect for autonomy**, the **tolerance of other opinions**, and the
**primacy of human rights**]{.underline}. We uphold these values in both
the Global North and the Global South.

**Claudio, 17**---Associate Professor at De La Salle University
Manila\'s College of Liberal Arts (Lisandro, "Defending Liberalism in
the Global South: Notes from Duterte\'s Philippines," The Global South,
Volume 11, Number 2, Fall 2017, pp. 92-107, dml)

First is [the claim that liberalism is a **universalizing Enlightenment
idea** that has **imposed itself** on colonial societies]{.underline}.
In displacing other forms of non-Western thinking, [critics
say]{.underline} it creates a hierarchy between a civilized/liberal
subject and an uncivilized/illiberal one, thus allowing for the violence
of colonialism. The most prominent writer in this vein is Uday Singh
Mehta (1999), who argues that [imperialism was **not a contradiction**
within liberal thought but **inherent** in it]{.underline}.2 Through
colonialism, he contends, liberalism "found a project, with all the
grandeur of scale, implicit permanence, purposefulness, and the absence
of a need to negotiate with what is extant" (12). Mehta based his
account largely on a critique of British liberalism and its effects on
colonial India. But others have applied his arguments to other liberal
empires. By examining the United States' colonial expansion in the late
nineteenth century, Julian Go challenges the narrative of an inclusive
liberal nationalism in the US. He contends that one must think of
"civic-liberal nations as liberal empire-states" (emphasis in original,
2017, 74). Drawing from the influential anti-liberalism of Losurdo
(2014), Go claims that both "are predicated upon a core hierarchized
binary of citizen and Other---that is, between those who are members of
the community because they are rational, mature, and civilized, and
those who are not" (74). [It is in this manner]{.underline}, he
concludes, [that US liberalism has **excluded various subaltern
groups**, from **African-American slaves** to **colonial-era
Filipinos**]{.underline}.

To the critique exemplified by Mehta and Go, I offer two replies. First,
[liberalism's universalism **does not necessarily lead to
colonialism**]{.underline}. In fact, [is it **reasonable** for a liberal
who believes in rational deliberation to **violently impose a set of
beliefs** on entire peoples? Scholars]{.underline} like Mehta [are
**wont to emphasize the universalizing desires** of
liberalism]{.underline} (its first face), [but they have **neglected its
other face**]{.underline}, what Gray calls [liberalism as **modus
vivendi**---a liberalism that allows for "**common institutions** in
which **many forms of life can coexist**"]{.underline} (2000, 6). [A
modus vivendi **cannot be colonialism**. And **neither** is colonialism
a way of **ordering liberty through institutions** that enhance
individual and collective freedoms]{.underline}. I must concede that [at
various points in liberalism's history, the pendulum has swung towards
its more universalizing tendencies. Yet to contend]{.underline}, as
anti-liberal postcolonial theorists do, [that liberalism is a
**universalizing project** that imposes itself on divergent belief
systems relies on an **incomplete vision** of the liberal
project]{.underline}.

A second reply relates to simple logic. [It is, of course, true that
liberalism creates "**others**." But **what political movement is
bereft** of an inside and outside?]{.underline} Marxism constructs the
proletariat in relation to the bourgeoisie, nationalism has foreigners,
various forms of identity politics insist on the primacy of specific
subject positions over others, and religions have non-believers. [In the
sense that it sees the world through a political subject, liberalism is
**no different** from other philosophies that create bonds of community.
And while philosophers have theorized **more fluid conceptions** of
political belonging]{.underline}--- Deleuze and Guattari's "rhizomatic"
subjectivity (1988), which inspired Hardt and Negri's conception of the
amorphous "multitude" (2005)---[it is **not clear** that these ideas
have produced **long-term movements** or **concrete
agendas**]{.underline}, especially in the Global South.

[The second claim is that liberalism is]{.underline} a modernist credo
external to the experiences of the Global South and postcolonies and
thus out of sync with the necessities of today. We have already noted
how de Sousa Santos views the "indifference" of liberalism as anathema
to the radical needs of the South. And we have also examined how the
Comaroffs view liberalism as [a "parochial" remnant of Euro-American
modernity]{.underline} inapplicable to the Global South, [both because
it **comes from Europe** and **America**, and because it is anchored on
**outdated beliefs** about the **rule of law**]{.underline}. Elsewhere,
[the Comaroffs contend that the liberal belief in "the **capacity for
constitutionalism** and **contract**, **rights** and **legal remedies**
to accomplish order, **civility**, **justice**, **empowerment**" is a
form of legal "**fetishism**" that is ultimately
"**chimerical**,"]{.underline} especially in postcolonial contexts. This
kind of politics, then, becomes nothing but a pyramid scheme: "The more
it is indulged, the more it is required" (2001, 38).

Again I offer two replies. First, [a history of liberalism shows that
its potency as a political credo is **not limited to the
West**]{.underline}. Of course, [we **cannot deny** that much of
liberalism's early history lies in Europe and that the US became a major
hub of liberal experimentation]{.underline}; liberalism's place in what
the Comaroffs label the "Euro-American" past is not up for debate. [But
because liberalism may encompass **shifting subjectivities**, political
actors have been able to **redefine liberalism within colonial
contexts**]{.underline}. Mehta is correct that [imperialists deployed
liberal rhetoric to justify expansionist policy. Nevertheless, the
**earliest anti-colonial movements** were likewise **liberal in
nature**, and]{.underline}, I would argue, [**more in line** with the
tenets of classical liberalism]{.underline}. [Anti-colonial radicals in
Spanish America]{.underline}, as Richard J. Evans notes,
[**corresponded** and **collaborated** with European liberals, forming a
**liberal** and **radical** "international whose connections **spanned
the Atlantic**"]{.underline} (2016, 17).

Spain was a crucial node in this liberal internationalism; its various
patriotic societies, which emerged after the Napoleonic wars, inspired
similar organizations throughout the continent (Evans 2016, 39). It is
thus unsurprising that European liberalism spread to Asia through the
Spanish colony of the Philippines. Historians John Schumacher (1991, 31)
and Nick Joaquin (2005, 24--35) have posited that the propaganda
movement that paved the way for the Philippine revolution of 1896 (the
first anti-colonial revolution in Asia) was birthed within a local
liberal tradition that mixed with nationalist anti-colonialism. Recent
evidence has shown, moreover, that, like the French revolution, the
Philippine revolution was also liberal in character.3

[Critics view liberalism through the eyes of "liberal" imperialists, but
they are **silent** about how colonized actors themselves **articulated
concepts of liberty** and **human rights** from their subaltern
positions]{.underline}. Philippine national hero, the polymath novelist
and polemicist [**Jose Rizal**, saw in]{.underline} the [liberal
tenets]{.underline} of the French declaration of rights [a **blueprint
for a society after colonialism**]{.underline}, translating the
declaration for his countrymen during a sojourn in Hong Kong (Schumacher
1997, 270). [He was a liberal who **criticized colonialism on liberal
grounds** and believed that liberals who abetted colonial rule were
**untrue to their principles**]{.underline}. Writing in 1890, Rizal
claimed that if Spanish liberals in the Philippines had "more faith in
their ideals," they would resist the colonial rule of Catholic friars
and that "modern ideas" would not "be asphyxiated upon touching the
shores of Manila" (1964, 289).

[If it is true that the one consistent feature of liberalism's history
has been the "**constant opposition to assorted tyrannies**," then the
**more authentic liberals** were those in colonial contexts, who argued
that **colonialism was tyranny writ large**]{.underline} (Ryan 2012,
28). For the Filipino propagandists, [there was a sense that
**liberalism could be purified** in colonial contexts]{.underline}.4
"Liberals" in positions of power more easily succumb to tyranny, thereby
turning their backs on their very own principles. [A **correction of
liberalism** could thus occur in places of disempowerment. What prevents
Global South thinkers from **appropriating this liberal
anti-colonialism** today? This appropriation **would not be a wholesale
adoption of modernity** and **Enlightenment**. Rather]{.underline}, as
in the case of Filipino propagandists, [it would begin by **grappling
with rights** and **liberties** in the postcolony, seeing how these can
be **enhanced** and **purified** in these new contexts]{.underline}.

My second reply to the argument about liberalism's inapplicability to
the postcolonial politics of the present rests on pragmatism. [Modernist
politics]{.underline} based on principles like constitutionalism [may be
**wanting**, but **what are our alternatives**?]{.underline} This is a
trite response, but [it **bears repeating**, especially in the context
of the Global South, where **people starve** and **immediate**, even
**palliative**, **change is urgent**. Reformism is **not anathema** to
postcolonial societies. A **fairer legal system** that allows the poor
to be **treated equal under the law**--- one that **affords them worthy
defenses** in criminal trials, one that prevents them from being
**kicked off their land** and **denied their property**---is a
**sustainable goal** that we **must aspire for**]{.underline}. And the
Global South would do well to aspire for social services like
state-sponsored healthcare (more dysfunctional in the Philippines than
even the United States) that curb the worst violences of the
"neoliberalism" that anti-liberals decry.

[Presumably, the advocates of non-modernist anti-liberalism]{.underline}
from the Global South [anchor their vision of change on a **renewed
revolutionary politics** that **challenges the core structures** of
contemporary capitalist societies. For them, another world is possible.
But **what are political actors in the Global South left to do** while
the theoreticians figure out **how** and **when** the revolutionary
break will occur? Liberalism promotes a baseline of **slow** yet
**functional politics** that **tempers the nihilism** of much radical
thinking. But, a **stable base** of political rights may **open new
possibilities** that may also **tickle our collective imaginations**.
Slow **does not mean uninspiring**]{.underline}.

There is also evidence to support the idea that in some instances,
states are emphasising non-traditional security issues and cooperation
associated with it as a mechanism for consolidating strategic
partnerships driven by more traditional strategic concerns. This might
be applied to the example of responses to the 2004 tsunami. Here, the
United States, Japan, India and Australia established a coalition to
coordinate aid delivery, in the process solidifying strategic relations
while responding to regional disaster. Such a development suggests
challenges associated with making clear distinctions between a
traditional and non-security agenda, challenges heightened if
non-traditional security is still viewed through the lens of state
security.4

[These issues raise important questions about the politics of security
as applied to critical approaches, especially those that wish to
contribute to **debates** about security practices: [should our **aim**
be to **speak**]{.mark} **truth to power** and articulate a bold vision
for **[substantially different sets of approaches and actors]{.mark}**,
**[or]{.mark}** to **[engage]{.mark}** those **[institutions]{.mark}**
and actors [with]{.mark} the [capacity to **enact change**]{.mark},
**attempting [to encourage more progressive practices]{.mark} in the

binary]{.mark}** in the sense that **scholarship** (**and** individual
**[scholars]{.mark}**) [can **do both**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But it
serves to remind us of the importance of engaging with the politics of
security. This is central to Lee Wilson's discussion of dynamics and
practices of security in Indonesia in this special issue.
[**Ultimately**, we [should]{.mark} be in a position to [**articulate**
grounds for **incremental progressive change** to **those with the power
to enact it**, **even while** compelling]{.mark} ourselves [to **keep
sight of a vision of security that is genuinely ethically
defensible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is a challenge for a **critical
approach to security**, but one which intellectual openness, humility
and **reflexivity** -- combined with acceptance of a division of
academic labour within the broad contours of such an approach -- might
go some way to addressing]{.underline}.

These [critical observations on the current security constellation
impart]{.underline} some [valuable warnings, some of which]{.underline},
as noted, [are shared by liberal critics]{.underline} of the 'war on
terror'. They suggest, [first and foremost, that democratic societies
risk spiralling into a vicious circle of terror--fear--repression whose
all too likely consequence is the erosion, perhaps even demise, of
democratic government and the rule of law]{.underline} (Rorty 2004). [As
political elites respond]{.underline} to acts of terror [with 'security
measures' that seek to assuage public insecurity]{.underline} (and
anger) [by further empowering police and military institutions, they do
several things: not only do they direct the resources of the partisan
state at already]{.underline} often unpopular and [over-policed minority
populations (both at home and abroad); they also institutionalize public
anxiety in ways that make it difficult to envisage cultural conditions
that will permit 'temporary' exceptional measures to be repealed, and
leave themselves with little practical choice but to respond to the next
terrorist attack with yet more -- still tougher -- 'security
solutions']{.underline}. As each 'ordering measure brings into being new
ambiguities and ambivalences which call for further measures, the chase
never ends' (Bauman and Tester 2001: 79; see, also, Dillon 1996: 127).

[For liberals the practical task is to find ways of responding
to]{.underline} terror (and the [fear]{.underline} and loathing that it
generates, or reinforces, or renews) [in ways that break out of this
insecurity-heightening, democracy-corroding spiral]{.underline} (see,
for example, Ackerman 2004; Ignatieff 2004; Dyzenhaus and Hunt
forthcoming). This too, more broadly, is the impulse that informs this
book -- [one that holds that **[it is possible]{.mark}** in this field
[to]{.mark} envisage and [create **virtuous circles** that **both**
**civilize security** **and** **release the civilizing potential of
security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The variant of state
[scepticism]{.underline} we have been concerned with here [presses,
however, a more disquieting claim -- one that presents a serious
critique of such possibilities]{.underline}. [From this perspective
there is no obvious route away from a world in which exceptionalism has
become]{.underline} what Agamben (2004a: 2 and passim) calls ['the
dominant paradigm of government]{.underline} in contemporary politics'
-- [and certainly not one which travels under the banner of
security]{.underline}. We are [faced with]{.underline} what looks set to
become an [unceasing war]{.underline} against terror [in which partisan,
exceptional states name and chase new enemies, fortify borders as they
violate them, suspend law in the name of law, and undermine democracy in
an effort to save it]{.underline}. [How, in such a world,
the]{.underline} leftist state [sceptic asks, can we speak meaningfully
about, let alone begin to construct, a socially coherent project of
collective security?]{.underline}

Against security?

The strands of radical thought outlined in this chapter offer a cogent
critique of the state and its securitizing practices. It is a critique
that appears able to capture important aspects of a historical record
that has seen states time and again, in both authoritarian and
democratic contexts, allocate the benefits and burdens of policing in
ways that systematically protect the security interests of powerful
constituencies at the expense of those of the poor and dispossessed. It
supplies, in addition, a cogent account of the dangers of placing
security at the ideological heart of government, of the capacity of
security politics to colonize public policy and pervade social life in
ways that threaten democratic values and sustain fear-laden,
other-disregarding forms of political subjectivity and collective
identity. In these respects, this variant of state scepticism offers a
critique of the operation and effects of state power that in many
significant respects we share (N. Walker 2000; Loader 2002). But it also
poses what are undoubtedly some profound challenges to the position we
wish here to construct and defend. If we are to make a persuasive case
for both the good of security, and the indispensability of the state to
the production of that good, then we need to find a means of rising to
them.

[These objections then are far from trivial]{.underline}, and we have
not devoted this chapter to them simply in order to knock them down.
[But they nonetheless arise from a standpoint that is not itself without
shortcomings]{.underline}, as we hope to show in meeting them. As a
prelude to the more sustained effort along these lines that we offer in
part II, let us consider briefly what these shortcomings are. For
analytic purposes, they may usefully be put into three groups.

[This radical variant of state [scepticism]{.mark} tends]{.underline},
first of all, [to [**underplay** the **openness of political
systems**]{.mark} and the theoretical and political prospects that this
affords]{.underline}. [It [displays]{.mark}, in particular, [a
**structural fatalism** that **overlooks**]{.mark} the **overlap**
between the **production of specific and general order**, such [that
disadvantaged groups]{.mark} and communities [have a **considerable
stake** not only in **controlling state power**, but]{.mark} also in
**[using public resources]{.mark}** (**[including policing
resources]{.mark}**) **[as a means of generating more secure forms
of]{.mark} economic and [social existence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It
also remains **insufficiently attentive** to how the mix between general
and specific order (the extent, in other words, to which
**[policing]{.mark}** is shaped by **common** as well as **factional**
interests) [is **conditioned by political struggle**]{.mark} and the
**varieties of [institutional settlement]{.mark}** to which this gives
rise, [thereby **varying** over **time** and between
**polities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much [the same point]{.underline},
moreover, [can be directed at the radical [critique of the violence that
underpins **liberal**]{.mark} **political [orders]{.mark}** that aim to
be free of such violence]{.underline}. One finds here a quite proper
insistence on the troubling conundrum that democratic polities
ultimately depend upon coercion to enforce collective decisions and
protect democratic institutions. But [this point is hammered home in
terms that are [**overly sweeping** and
**reductionist**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- often, as in the writings of
Agamben (2004a), as a philosophical claim that invites but resists
sociological scrutiny. [If 'there is always a violence at the heart of
every form of political and legal authority']{.underline} (Newman 2004:
575), [upon what grounds can we distinguish between, or develop a
critique of, the security-seeking practices of particular states -- and
why would we bother?]{.underline}

[Radical anti-statism evinces]{.underline}, secondly, [a preference for
social and political **criticism** **over** social and political
**reconstruction**]{.underline}. [It favours a politics that
**[privileges]{.mark}** the monitoring, **[exposure and
critique]{.mark}** of the systematic biases of state power]{.underline}
(as, for instance, in the indefatigable efforts of the British-based NGO
Statewatch), [one that implicitly or expressly holds that **'security'**
is **so stained** by its uncivil association with the (military and
police) state that the only available radical strategy is to destabilize
the term itself, while contesting the practices that are enacted under
its name]{.underline} (Dalby 1997: 6; see, also, Dillon 1996: ch. 1).
[There can, from this vantage point, be no progressive democratic
politics aimed at civilizing security. Rather, one is [left with]{.mark}
a politics of critique, and [a **failure of political imagination**,
that **leaves radically underspecified** the **feasible or desirable
alternatives**]{.mark} to current institutional configurations and
practices, [or else **merely gestures towards the possibility of
transcendent forms**]{.mark} of non-state communal ordering]{.underline}
-- as in George Rikagos's (2002: 150) claim that 'the only real
alternatives to current policing practices are pre-capitalist,
non-commodified security arrangements'.

[Finally, one finds what we think of as [a **one-sided appraisal** of
the **sources of inequality and insecurity**]{.mark} in the world
today]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} leftist anti-statist sensibility
[tends]{.underline}, in the ways we have demonstrated, [towards an
account of social injustice that **[views it as the product of the
state's]{.mark} malign and [coercive interventions]{.mark}** [rather
than]{.mark} of [its **impotence and neglect**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Here one finds a curious parallel with the neo-liberalism considered in
the last chapter -- the state remains the problem. But one also
encounters a critique of security politics that views it as tied to the
production of authoritarian government -- [[**as if** **security** is in
some **essential** fashion **inimical to democracy**]{.mark} and human
rights]{.underline}. [Here the radical critic begins to inhabit similar
ground to that occupied by]{.underline} what we characterized in chapter
1 as [the **'security lobby'**]{.underline}. [They assess the landscape
very differently and commit to diametrically opposed political purposes.
But they **cling** commonly and tenaciously to the **belief** that
**security**]{.underline} stands **[opposed to liberty]{.underline}**.

[Our aim]{.underline}, in part II, [is to [**move beyond** these]{.mark}
positions and **[oppositions]{.mark}**: first, by [retrieving]{.mark}
the idea of [**security as a public good** that]{.mark} is axiomatic
both to the production of other goods (most directly, liberty) and to
the constitution of democratic political communities; second, by arguing
that the production of this good [demands **not**]{.mark} the [wholesale
**critique and transcendence**]{.mark} of state forms, [but **more
robust regulatory interventions**]{.mark} by democratized state
institutions]{.underline}. We must first, however, factor into our
positive case two further critiques of the state, starting with the
claim that it is a cultural monolith.

### AT: ALT -- Poststructuralism

#### The ALT [solves nothing]{.underline} -- BUT [even if]{.underline} it did, [transition wars]{.underline} [outweigh]{.underline}

Perhaps more [alarming]{.underline} though [is the outright
violence]{.underline} Ashley [recommends in response to]{.underline}
what at best seem trite, if not [imagined, injustices]{.underline}.
[[Inculpating]{.mark} modernity, **[positivism]{.mark}**, technical
rationality, or realism [with **violence**, **racism**, **war**]{.mark},
and countless other crimes]{.underline} not only smacks of
anthropomorphism but, as demonstrated by Ashley's torturous prose and
reasoning, [[requires a **dubious logic**]{.mark} to make such
connections in the first place]{.underline}. [[Are we really to believe
that]{.mark} ethereal entities like positivism, modernism, or realism
emanate a "violence" that marginalizes dissidents?]{.underline} Indeed,
where is this violence, repression, and marginalization? As
self-professed dissidents supposedly exiled from the discipline, Ashley
and Walker appear remarkably well integrated into the academy---vocal,
published, and at the center of the Third Debate and the forefront of
theoretical research. Likewise, is Ashley seriously [suggesting that,
[on the basis of this largely **imagined violence**]{.mark}, **[global
transformation]{.mark}** (perhaps [even **revolutionary
violence**]{.mark}) [is]{.mark} a [**necessary**, let alone
**desirable**]{.mark}, response**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Has [the
rationale for emancipation or the fight for justice been reduced to such
vacuous revolutionary slogans as "Down with positivism and
rationality"]{.underline}? The point is surely trite. [Apart from
members of the academy, who has heard of positivism and who for a moment
imagines that they need to be emancipated from it, or from modernity,
rationality, or realism for that matter?]{.underline} In an era of
unprecedented change and turmoil, of new political and military
configurations, of wrar in the Balkans and ethnic cleansing, is Ashley
really [suggesting [that]{.mark} some of [the **greatest threats facing
humankind**]{.mark} or some of the great moments of history **[rest on
such innocuous and largely unknown nonrealities like
positivism]{.mark}** and realism**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [These are
imagined and fictitious enemies, [**theoretical fabrications** that
represent **arcane, self-serving debates**]{.mark} superfluous to the
lives of most people and, arguably, to most issues of importance in
international relations]{.underline}.

More is the pity that such irrational and obviously abstruse debate
should so occupy us at a time of great global turmoil. That it does and
continues to do so reflects our lack of judicious criteria for
evaluating theory and, more importantly, the lack of attachment
theorists have to the real world. [Certainly it is right and proper that
we ponder the depths of our theoretical imaginations]{.underline},
engage in epistemological and ontological debate, and analyze the
sociology of our knowledge.37 [But [to suppose]{.mark} that [this is the
**only task** of international theory, **let alone the most
important**]{.mark} one]{.underline}, smacks of intellectual elitism and
[[displays]{.mark} a certain [**contempt for those who search for
guidance** in]{.mark} their **[daily struggles]{.mark}** as actors [in
international politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [What does]{.underline}
Ashley's project, his [deconstructive efforts, or valiant fight against
positivism say to the truly marginalized, oppressed, and destitute?
[**How** does it]{.mark} help **[solve]{.mark}** the plight of the poor,
the displaced refugees, the casualties of war, or the emigres of death
squads**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Does it in any wray speak to those
whose actions and thoughts comprise the policy and practice of
international relations?

On all these questions one must answer no. This is not to say, of
course, that all theory should be judged by its technical rationality
and problem-solving capacity as Ashley forcefully argues. But [[to
suppose]{.mark} that [**problem-solving technical theory** is **not
necessary**---or]{.mark} is in some way **[bad]{.mark}**---is a
contemptuous position that **[abrogates any hope of solving]{.mark}**
some of [the **nightmarish realities** that **millions confront
daily**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Holsti argues, we need ask of these
theorists and their theories the ultimate question, "So what?" To what
purpose do they deconstruct, problcmatize, destabilize, undermine,
ridicule, and belittle modernist and rationalist approaches? [Does this
get us any further, make the world any better, or enhance the human
condition? In what sense can this "**debate** toward \[[a]{.mark}\]
**[bottomless pit of epistemology and metaphysics]{.mark}**" be judged
pertinent, relevant, **helpful**, or cogent to **anyone** other than
those foolish enough to be **scholastically excited** by abstract and
recondite **debate.**]{.underline}38

Contrary to Ashley's assertions, then, [a poststructural approach fails
to empower the marginalized and, in fact, abandons them]{.underline}.
[Rather than analyze the political economy of power, wealth, oppression,
production, or international relations and render an intelligible
understanding of these processes]{.underline}, Ashley succeeds in
ostracizing those he portends to represent by delivering an obscure and
highly convoluted discourse. If Ashley wishes to chastise structural
realism for its abstractness and detachment, he must be prepared also to
face similar criticism, especially when he so adamantly intends his work
to address the real life plight of those w ho struggle at marginal
places.

#### [No purchase]{.underline} in [academia]{.underline} nor [outside]{.underline}

There are also a host of technological and logistical questions that
plague George's scheme and make problematic his recommendations. For
example, through what medium are those on the fringes of the
international system going to speak to the world? Although it may be
true that the third world has now been integrated into the global polity
via the advent of technological innovations in communications, allowing
for remote access to information sources and the Internet, it also
remains true that the majority of those on the fringes continue to be
disenfranchised from such mediums, whether as a result of a lack of
economic resources, the prevalence of illiteracy, or social, cultural
and political circumstances that systemically exclude, women (among
others) from economic resources and certain political and social
freedoms. Need we remind George that social, political, and individual
autonomy is at a minimum in these parts of the world, and [an
intellectual approach as controversial as postmodernism is **[not likely
to achieve]{.mark}**]{.underline} the sorts of
**[[goals]{.underline}]{.mark}** that George optimistically foreshadows.
Indeed, [on **practical questions**]{.underline} such as these, [matters
otherwise central to the success of postmodern visions]{.underline},
George [prefers to be **vague**, suggesting instead that the intricacies
of such details will somehow work themselves out in a manner
satisfactory to all]{.underline}. [Such a position reveals]{.underline}
George's [latent idealism and underscores how]{.underline} George's
[schema is]{.underline} an intellectual one: [a theory of international
politics written for other theorists of international
politics]{.underline}. George's [audience is thus a **very limited and
elite audience** and begs the question of whether a senior, middle-class
scholar]{.underline} in the intellectual heartland of Australia [can do
anything of real substance to aid the truly marginalized and
oppressed]{.underline}. How is it possible to put oneself in the shoes
of the "other," to advocate on his or her behalf, when such is done from
a position of affluence, unrelated to and far removed from the
experiences of those whom George otherwise champions? [Ideals are all
good and well, but it is hard to imagine that the computer keyboard is
mightier than the sword, and **[hard to see how a small, elite]{.mark},
affluent [assortment of intellectuals is going to generate the type of
political momentum necessary]{.mark}** to allow those on the fringes to
speak and be heard!]{.underline} 1 .

[Moreover, **why** should we **assume** that **states** and individuals
want to listen and **will listen**]{.underline} to what the marginalized
and the oppressed have to say? There is precious little evidence to
suggest that "listening" is something the advanced capitalist countries
do very well at all. Indeed, one of the allegations so forcefully
alleged by Muslim fundamentalists as justification for the terrorist
attacks of September I I is precisely that the West, and America in
particular, are deaf to the disenfranchised and impoverished in the
world. Certainly, there are agencies and individuals who are sensitive
to the needs of the "marginalized" and who champion institutional forums
where indigenous voices can be heard. But on even the most optimistic
reckoning, such forums and institutions represent the exception, not the
rule, and remain in the minority if not dwarfed by those institutions
that represent Western, first world interests. To be sure, this is a
realist power-political image of the current configuration of the global
polity, but one apparently, and ironically, endorsed by George if only
because it speaks to the realities of the marginalized, the imposed
silences, and the multitude of oppressions on which George founds his
call for a postmodern ethic.

[Recognizing such realities]{.underline}, however, [does not
explain]{.underline} George's penchant for [ignoring them entirely,
especially in terms of the structural rigidities they pose for
meaningful reform]{.underline}. Indeed, George's [**[desire to move to a
new "space beyond I]{.mark}**nternational **[R]{.mark}**elations" smacks
of **[wishful idealism]{.mark}**, **[ignoring]{.mark} the current
configuration of [global political relations and power
distribution]{.mark}**]{.underline}; of the incessant ideological power
of hyperindividualism, consumerism, advertising, Hollywood images, and
fashion icons; and of the innate power bestowed on the (institutional)
barons of global finance, trade, and transnational production. George
[seems to [have **little appreciation of the structural impediments
such**]{.mark} **institutions [pose for radical
change]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the type he so fiercely advocates.
[Revolutionary change]{.underline} of the kind desired by George
[ignores that fact that many individuals are not disposed to concerns
beyond their family, friends, and daily work lives. And institutional,
**structural transformation [requires organized effort, mass popular
support]{.mark}**, and dogged single-mindedness if societal norms are to
be challenged, institutional reform enacted]{.underline}, consumer
tastes altered, [and political sensibilities reformed]{.underline}.
Convincing Nike that there is something intrinsically wrong with paying
Indonesian workers a few dollars a week to manufacture shoes for the
global market requires considerably more effort than postmodern
platitudes and/or moral indignation. The cycle of wealth creation and
distribution that sees Michael Jordan receive multimillion dollar
contracts to inspire demand for Nike products, while the foot soldiers
in the factory eke out a meager existence producing these same products
is not easily, or realistically, challenged by pronouncements of moving
beyond International Relations to a new, nicer, gentler nirvana.

[More generally]{.underline}, of course, what George **[[fails to
consider]{.underline}]{.mark}** is [the problem of [**apathy**
and]{.mark} of **[how we get people to care about]{.mark} the plight of
[others]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What do we with the CEOs of
multinational corporations, stockbrokers, accountants, ctory workers,
and the unemployed, who, by and large, fail to consider the omeless and
destitute in their own countries, let alone in places they have never
isited and are never likely to visit? [**[Moral indignation rarely
translates into action]{.mark}**, and **apathy** about the plight of
others is a **structural impediment as strong any** idea, **theory**, or
writing]{.underline}. What George's treatise thus [fails to
consider]{.underline} is [how we overcome this, and how we get others to
listen]{.underline}. He needs to explain how the social, political,
psychological, and moral structures that define the parameters of
existence for the many millions of ordinary citizens in the first world,
and that deflects attention from the marginalized and the oppressed can
be broken down. Unfortunately, there is little to indicate that George
has thought much about this, suggesting that his [[**commitment to
postmodern theory** is **not likely to make much
difference**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In fact, **[in the academy]{.mark}**
the postmodern light is **[already beginning to dim]{.mark}** in certain
quarters, having **[registered scarcely a glimmer in the broader
polity]{.mark}**, where, if change was to ensue, it needed to burn
brightly]{.underline}. [Even among those versed in the nomenclature of
scholarly debate, **theorists of international politics remain
skeptical** of the value of postmodern discourse, by and large rejecting
it. This **does not portend well** for postmodern visionaries and the
future of postmodern discourse]{.underline}. But can George really be
surprised by this? After all, his discourse indicts the "backward
discipline" for complicity in crimes against humanity, calling for a
repudiation of realism and with it a repudiation of the lifelong beliefs
and writings of eminent theorists like Kenneth Waltz, Robert Gilpin, and
Stephen Krasner who have otherwise defined the parameters of the
discipline, its projects, and research agendas. Can George really expect
discipline-wide capitulation to an intellectual diaspora that would see
theorists repudiate their beliefs and works in order to take up the
creed of postmodernism, as vague, open-ended, and indeterminate as it
is? Without a clear and credible plan of how to get from "incarceration
and closure" to intellectual freedom, creativity, and openness, George's
postmodern musings have understandably attracted few disciples.

#### Poststructural analysis [fails]{.underline}

**Rodwell 5** Jonathan Rodwell, PhD candidate, Manchester Metropolitan
University, post-graduate studies at The University of Birmingham,
"Trendy But Empty: A Response to Richard Jackson," 49^th^ Parallel: An
Interdiscplinary Journal of North American Studies, iss.15, Spring 2005,
<https://fortyninthparalleljournal.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/2-rodwell-trendy-but-empty.pdf>
/GoGreen!

However, having said that, the problem is Jackson's own theoretical
underpinning, his own justification for the importance of language. If
he was merely proposing that the understanding of language as one of
many causal factors is important that would be fine. But he is not.
[[The]{.mark} epistemological and **theoretical [framework]{.mark}** of
his argument [means the **ONLY thing we should look at is
language**]{.mark}]{.underline} and this is the problem.\[ii\] Rather
than being a fairly simple, but nonetheless valid, argument, because of
the theoretical justification it actually becomes an almost nonsensical.

My response is roughly laid out in four parts. Firstly I will argue that
[[such methodology]{.underline}]{.mark}, in isolation, [[is]{.mark}
fundamentally **[reductionist]{.mark}**]{.underline} with a theoretical
underpinning that does not conceal this simplicity. Secondly, that [a
strict use of [**post-structural discourse analysis** results in an
**epistemological cul-de-sac**]{.mark} in which the writer cannot
actually say anything. Moreover the reader has no reason to accept
anything that has been written. The result is **[at best]{.mark}** an
explanation that remains as **[equally valid as any other]{.mark}
possible [interpretation]{.mark}** and at worse a work that **[retains
no critical force]{.mark}** whatsoever]{.underline}. Thirdly, [possible
arguments in response to this charge; that such approaches provide a
more acceptable explanation than others are]{.underline}, in effect,
[both a tacit acceptance of the poverty of force within the approach
[and]{.mark} of the [**complete lack of understanding** of the
**identifiable effects of the real world**]{.mark}]{.underline} around
us; thus [[highlighting]{.mark} the [contradictions]{.mark}
with[in]{.mark} post-structural claims to be **[moving beyond]{.mark}**
traditional **[causality]{.mark}**, re-affirming that [rather
than]{.mark} pursuing [a **post-structural** approach we should continue
to employ]{.mark} the **[traditional
methodologies]{.mark}**]{.underline} with[[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
History, Politics and [**[I]{.mark}**nternational
**[R]{.mark}**elations]{.underline}. Finally as a consequence of these
limitations I will argue that the post-structural call for
'intertextuals' must be practiced rather than merely preached and that
an understanding and utilisation of all possible theoretical approaches
must be maintained if academic writing is to remain useful rather than
self-contained and narrative. Ultimately I conclude that whilst
undeniably of some value, post-structural approaches are at best a
footnote in our understanding.

The first major problem then is that [historiographically **discourse
analysis** is **so capacious** as to be largely of **little
use**]{.underline}. [The process of inscription identity, of discourse
development is not given any political or historical context, it is
argued that it just works, is simply a universal
phenomenon]{.underline}. [It is **history that explains everything and
therefore actually explains nothing**]{.underline}.

To be specific [[**if** the U.S. and every other nation is **continually
reproducing identities** through **'othering'** it is a
**constant**]{.mark} and universal phenomenon that [**fails to help us
understand at all** why]{.mark} one result of the othering [turned
out]{.mark} one way and [differently]{.mark} at another
time]{.underline}. For example, how could one explain how the process
resulted in the 2003 invasion of Iraq but didn't produce a similar
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 when that country (and by the logic of
the Regan administrations discourse) the West was threatened by the
'Evil Empire'. By the logical of discourse analysis in both cases these
policies were the result of politicians being able to discipline and
control the political agenda to produce the outcomes. So why were the
outcomes not the same? To reiterate the point how do we explain that the
language of the War on Terror actually managed to result in the eventual
Afghan invasion in 2002? Surely it is impossible to explain how George
W. Bush was able to convince his people (and incidentally the U.N and
Nato) to support a war in Afghanistan without referring to a simple fact
outside of the discourse; the fact that a known terrorist in Afghanistan
actually admitted to the murder of thousands of people on the 11h of
Sepetember 2001. The point is that [**[if]{.mark}** the **[discursive
'othering']{.mark}** of]{.underline} an 'alien' [people or group [is
what really gave]{.mark} the U.S. the opportunity to persue [the **war
in Afghanistan**]{.mark} one must surly wonder why Afghanistan. **[Why
not No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea**[?]{.mark}**]{.underline} Or
Scotland? If the discourse is so powerfully useful in it's own right why
could it not have happened anywhere at any time and more often? Why
could the British government not have been able to justify an armed
invasion and regime change in Northern Ireland throughout the terrorist
violence of the 1980's? Surely they could have just employed the same
discursive trickery as George W. Bush? Jackson is absolutely right when
he points out that the actuall threat posed by Afghanistan or Iraq today
may have been thoroughly misguided and conflated and that there must be
more to explain why those wars were enacted at that time. [Unfortunately
[that **explanation** **cannot**]{.mark} simply **[come from]{.mark}**
the result of [**inscripting identity** and
**discourse**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What are the implications of the growing capabilities and dissemination
of AI, ML and BD for NATO? Is the Atlantic Alliance powerless when
[**[faced with]{.mark}** this wave of **[technological

and address the ensuing challenges and opportunities? And [**[what

Building on the previous discussion of AI as a GPT, it appears that the
challenge for NATO is subtle, multifaceted and significant. First, in an
age of accelerating technological change and growing domain
applicability, catching up with industry leaders and innovators becomes
more and more difficult for those that lag behind.73 This means that
[**[waiting is not a solution]{.mark}** -- [even though

direction, vision or investments in infrastructure]{.underline}. Third,
while [some countries will have an advantage, others will find the
transition more difficult]{.underline}. Regardless of this,
technological transitions do not occur in a vacuum, as they require the
alignment of incentives among a multiplicity of actors, organizations
and institutions, as well as the provision of complementary services and
goods for the new technologies to flourish and be adopted.75 Fourth, and
more important [for [**NATO**, **without**]{.mark}]{.underline}
coordinating and [**[cooperating]{.mark}** on]{.underline} their
investments in [the necessary complementary assets, goods and services,
Allies could find themselves [having to **face additional
hurdles**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

What types of problem could emerge? Technology-generated efficiency
gains in production lead to lower prices. However, lower prices lead to
increases in demand -- because the relative price of substitute goods
(rivals) increases.76 Over the past decade, AI -- and, in particular, ML
-- has made a particular activity, prediction, cheaper: it is reasonable
to forecast that this trend will continue in the future.77 As AI becomes
cheaper, however, the demand for AI-related services will increase, thus
leading to more demand for related necessities like AI specialists, AI
infrastructure (and 5G networks) and AI components (processors). This in
turn might well lead to scarcity and higher prices, thus pitching actors
against one another -- not unlike the early stages of the COVID-19
crisis, when individual self-interested actions led to collectively bad
outcomes.78 [In the context of a military alliance, the problem goes
much deeper, as it can [generate a **beggar-thy-neighbour** effect with
**allies competing**]{.mark} for the same scarce
resources]{.underline}.79 [Moreover, **without** consultation and
**cooperation**]{.underline}, Allies could end up developing different
technological solutions, with the risk of undermining compatibility and
interoperability. Similarly, they could [end up prioritizing some
problems over others, with the risk of developing multiple, different
and redundant solutions while neglecting other points in need of
attention]{.underline}.80 However, through intra-alliance coordination
and cooperation, as well as dialogue and consultation, secondary market
mechanisms and other approaches, NATO could provide an important
contribution to identify and address this type of problems.81

### AT: Threat Inflation

#### Our threats are [real]{.underline} and [objectively knowable]{.underline} -- [institutional incentives]{.underline} militate [against]{.underline} threat [inflation]{.underline}, [NOT for]{.underline}

**Ravenal 9** Earl C. Ravenal, Distinguished Senior Fellow in Foreign
Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, professor emeritus of the
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, "What\'s Empire Got to
Do with It? The Derivation of America\'s Foreign Policy." Critical
Review: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Politics and Society, 21(1),
2009, pp.40-43 /GoGreen!

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} underlying [[notion of]{.mark} "the
**[security bureaucracies]{.mark}** . . . **[looking for new
enemies]{.mark}**" [is]{.mark} a **[threadbare]{.mark} concept** that
has somehow taken hold across the political spectrum, from the radical
left]{.underline} (viz. Michael Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat
bank"), [to the liberal center]{.underline} (viz. Robert H. Johnson
\[1997\], who dismisses most alleged "threats" as "improbable dangers"),
[to libertarians]{.underline} (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter \[1992\], Vice
President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato Institute, who
wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What is [missing
from]{.mark} most analysts' [claims of "**threat inflation**]{.mark},"
however, [is a convincing theory of **why**]{.mark}]{.underline}, say,
[the American government significantly (not merely in excusable
rhetoric) might magnify and even invent threats (and, more seriously,
act on such inflated threat estimates)]{.underline}.

In a few places, Eland (2004, 185) [[suggests]{.mark} that such behavior
might [stem from]{.mark} military or national security bureaucrats'
[attempts to enhance]{.mark} their personal [**status** and]{.mark}
organizational [**budgets**, or]{.mark} even [from the]{.mark} influence
and dominance of "[the]{.mark}
**[m]{.mark}**ilitary-**[i]{.mark}**ndustrial
**[c]{.mark}**omplex"]{.underline}; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and
retaliating for the blowback from that empire keeps what President
Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in
the same section:

> In the nation's capital, vested interests, such as the law enforcement
> bureaucracies . . . routinely take advantage of "crises"to satisfy
> parochial desires. Similarly, many corporations use crises to get pet
> projects---a.k.a. pork---funded by the government. And national
> security crises, because of people's fears, are especially ripe
> opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182)

Thus, ["**bureaucratic-politics**" theory]{.underline}, which once made
several reputations (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin,
and Graham Allison) in defense-intellectual circles, and spawned an
entire sub-industry within the field of international relations,5 is put
into the service of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary.

[So, too]{.underline}, can a surprisingly cognate theory, ["**public
choice**,"]{.underline}6 which can be considered the right-wing analog
of the "bureaucratic-politics" model, and is a preferred interpretation
of governmental decision-making among libertarian observers. As Eland
(2004, 203) summarizes:

> Public-choice theory argues \[that\] the government itself can develop
> separate interests from its citizens. The government reflects the
> interests of powerful pressure groups and the interests of the
> bureaucracies and the bureaucrats in them. Although this problem
> occurs in both foreign and domestic policy, it may be more severe in
> foreign policy because citizens pay less attention to policies that
> affect them less directly.

There is, in this statement of public-choice theory, a certain
ambiguity, and a certain degree of contradiction: Bureaucrats are
supposedly, at the same time, subservient to societal interest groups
and autonomous from society in general.

This journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public-ignorance and elite-expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post-government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for
lucrative self-dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract-dispensing and more under-the-radar-screen agencies of
government, the "public-choice" imputation of self-dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self-promoting interest groups---about what
strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.

Ironically, "public choice"---not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation---is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic-politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent-seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub- rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives.

My treatment of "role" differs from that of the bureaucratic-politics
theorists, whose model of the derivation of foreign policy depends
heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and specific identification of
the role- playing of organizationally situated individuals in a partly
conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that "results in" some policy
outcome. Even here, bureaucratic-politics theorists Graham Allison and
Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some players are not able to
articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics game because their
conception of their job does not legitimate such activity." This is a
crucial admission, and one that points--- empirically---to the need for
a broader and generic treatment of role.

Roles (all theorists state) give rise to "expectations" of performance.
My point is that [virtually every governmental role, and especially
[national-security roles]{.mark}, and particularly the roles of the
uniformed military, [embody]{.mark} expectations of devotion to the
"national interest"; rationality in the derivation of policy at every
functional level; and [**objectivity** in]{.mark} the [treatment
of]{.mark} parameters, especially external parameters such as
[**"threats"** and the **power** and **capabilities** of other
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Sub-rational models (such as "public choice") fail to take into account
even a partial dedication to the "national" interest (or even the
possibility that the national interest may be honestly misconceived in
more paro- chial terms). In contrast, an official's role connects the
individual to the (state-level) process, and moderates the (perhaps
otherwise) self-seeking impulses of the individual. [Role-derived
behavior tends to be formalized and codified; relatively
[**transparent** and]{.mark} at least
**[peer-reviewed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so as to be consistent with
expectations; surviving the particular individual and transmitted to
successors and ancillaries; measured against a standard and thus
corrigible; defined in terms of the performed function and therefore
derived from the state function; and uncorrrupt, because personal
cheating and even egregious aggrandizement are conspicuously
discouraged.

[**My own direct observation** suggests that defense decision-makers
attempt to **["frame"]{.mark}** the structure of the
**[problems]{.mark}** that they try to solve [on the basis of the **most
accurate intel**]{.mark}**ligence**. They make it their business to know
where the threats come from. Thus, [threats are **not "socially
constructed"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (even though, of course, some values
are).

A major reason for the rationality, and the objectivity, of the process
is that much [security planning is done, not in vaguely undefined
circumstances that offer scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior,
but rather in structured and reviewed organizational
frameworks]{.underline}. Non-rationalities (which are bad for
understanding and prediction) tend to get filtered out. [[**People are
fired** for presenting **skewed analysis** and]{.mark} for making **[bad
predictions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [[because something
important is riding on the **causal analysis**]{.mark} and the
**contingent prediction**]{.underline}.

For these reasons, "public choice" [does not have the "feel" of reality
to many critics who have participated in the structure of defense
decision-making. In that structure]{.underline}, obvious, and even
not-so-obvious, [[**"rent-seeking"** would]{.mark} not only be shameful;
it would [present a **severe risk of career
termination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And, as mentioned, the defense
bureaucracy is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent-seekers
to operate compared to opportunities for personal profit in the
commercial world. [A bureaucrat's very **self-placement** in these
reaches of **government** testifies either to a sincere commitment to
the national interest or to a **[lack]{.mark}** of sufficient
imagination to exploit [opportunities for **personal
profit**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### AT: Objectivity Bad

#### Objectivity is good -- ALT fails without it

Political Economy, Goldsmiths University of London, Ph.D. Development
Studies, University of Sussex, "From Eurocentrism to Epistemological
Internationalism: power, knowledge and objectivity in International
Relations," paper presented at Theorising Ontology, Annual Conference of

<http://www.csog.group.cam.ac.uk/iacr/papers/Jones.pdf> /GoGreen!

[The 'common-sense' view pervading recent [discussions of
**epistemology**]{.mark}, **ontology** and **methodology** in IR
[assert]{.mark}s [that **objectivity implies value-free
neutrality**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[However]{.mark}, **objective social
inquiry has an inherent tendency to be critical**]{.underline}, in
various senses. **[[To the extent that objective knowledge provides a
better]{.mark} and more adequate [account of reality]{.mark} than other
ideas, such knowledge [is inherently critical]{.mark} (implicitly or
explicitly) of those ideas]{.underline}**. 30 In other words **[critical
social [inquiry does not]{.mark} (or not only) [manifest its
'criticalness' through]{.mark} self-claimed [labels]{.mark} of being
critical [or siding with the oppressed, but through]{.mark} the
substantive critique of prevailing ideas]{.underline}**. [Objective
social knowledge constitutes a specific form of criticism:
**[explanatory critique]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The critique [of
dominant ideas or ideologies is elaborated through providing a more
adequate explanation of aspects of the world, and in so doing exposing
what is wrong with the dominant ideology]{.underline}. This may also
entail revealing the social conditions which give rise to ideologies,
thus exposing the necessary and causal relation between particular
social relations and particular ideological conceptions. In societies
which are constituted by unequal structures of social relations giving
rise to unequal power and conflicting interests, [the reproduction of
those structured relations is in the interests of the powerful, whereas
transformation of existing structured relations is in the interests of
the weak]{.underline}. **[Because ideas inform social action they are
casually efficacious]{.underline}** [either in]{.underline} securing
[the reproduction of existing social relations]{.underline} (usually as
an unintended consequence of social practice), [or in]{.underline}
informing social action aimed at [transforming social
relations]{.underline}. This is why ideas cannot be 'neutral'. Ideas
which provide a misrepresentation of the nature of society, the causes
of unequal social conditions, and the conflicting interests of the weak
and powerful, will tend to help secure the reproduction of prevailing
social relations. Ideas which provide a more adequate account of the way
society is structured and how structured social relations produce
concrete conditions of inequality and exploitation can potentially
inform efforts to change those social relations. In this sense, ideas
which are false are ideological and, in serving to promote the
reproduction of the status quo and avoid attempts at radical change, are
in the interests of the powerful. An account which is objective will
contradict ideological ideas, implicitly or explicitly criticising them
for their false or flawed accounts of reality. The criticism here arises
not, or not only, from pointing out the coincidence between ideologies
and the interests of the powerful, nor from a prior normative stance of
solidarity with the oppressed, but from exposing the flaws in dominant
ideologies through a more adequate account of the nature and causes of
social conditions 31 . **[[A normative commitment to the oppressed must
entail a commitment to truth and objectivity, because]{.mark} true ideas
are in the interest of the oppressed, [false ideas are in the interest
of]{.mark} the [oppressors]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In other words,
**[the best way to declare solidarity with the oppressed is to declare
one's commitment to objective inquiry]{.underline}** 32 . As
Nzongola-Ntalaja (1986: 10) has put it: It is a question of whether one
analyses society from the standpoint of the **[dominant
groups]{.underline}**, who [**have a vested interest in mystifying** the
way **society** works]{.underline}, or from the standpoint of [ordinary
people]{.underline}, who [have nothing to lose from truthful analyses of
their predicament]{.underline}. [The **philosophical realist theory of
science**, objectivity and explanatory critique]{.underline} thus
[provides an alternative response to the relationship between knowledge
and power]{.underline}. [**Instead of choosing perspectives on the basis
of our ethical commitment to the cause of the oppressed** and to
emancipatory social change, **we should choose between contending ideas
on the basis of which provides a better account of objective social
reality**]{.underline}. This will inherently provide a critique of the
ideologies which, by virtue of their flawed account of the social world,
serve the interests of the powerful. Exemplars of explanatory critique
in International Relations are provided in the work of scholars such as
Siba Grovogui, James Gathii, Anthony Anghie, Bhupinder Chimni, Jacques
Depelchin, Hilbourne Watson, Robert Vitalis, Sankaran Krishna,
Michel-Rolph Trouillot 33 . Their work provides critiques of central
categories, theories and discourses in the theory and practice of IR and
narratives of world history, including assumptions about sovereignty,
international society, international law, global governance, the nature
of the state. They expose the ideological and racialised nature of
central aspects of IR through a critical examination of both the long
historical trajectory of imperial ideologies regarding colonized
peoples, and the actual practices of colonialism and decolonisation in
the constitution of international orders and local social conditions.
Their work identifies the flaws in current ideas by revealing how they
systematically misrepresent or ignore the actual history of social
change in Africa, the Caribbean and other regions of the Third World,
both past and present -- during both colonial and neo-colonial periods
of the imperial world order. Their work reveals how racism, violence,
exploitation and dispossession, colonialism and neo-colonialism have
been central to the making of contemporary international order and
contemporary doctrines of international law, sovereignty and rights, and
how such themes are glaring in their absence from histories and theories
of international relations and international history. [Objective social
knowledge which accurately depicts and explains social reality has these
qualities by virtue of its relation to its object, not its
subject]{.underline}. As Collier argues, "The science/ideology
distinction is an epistemological one, not a social one." (Collier 1979:
60). So, [for example, in the work of Grovogui, Gathii and Depelchin,
the general perspective]{.underline} and knowledge [of]{.underline}
conditions in and [the history of Africa might be due]{.underline}
largely [to the African social origins of the authors]{.underline}.
[However the judgement that their accounts are superior]{.underline} to
those of mainstream IR [rests not on the fact that the authors are
African, but on the greater adequacy of their accounts]{.underline}
[with respect to]{.underline} the actual [historical and contemporary
production of conditions and change in Africa]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [elsewhere]{.underline} in the Third World. The
criteria for choosing their accounts over others derives from the
relation between the ideas and their objects (what they are about), not
from the relation between the ideas and their subjects (who produced
them). It is vital to retain explicitly some commitment to objectivity
in social inquiry, to the notion that the proper criterion for judging
ideas about the world lies in what they say about the world, not whose
ideas they are. [A fundamental problem which underlies the origin and
reproduction of IR's eurocentricity]{.underline} [is the overwhelming
dominance of ideas produced in and by the west, and the wilful and
determined silencing of the voices and histories of the
colonised]{.underline}. [But the result of this fundamental problem is
flawed knowledge about the world]{.underline}. [**Eurocentricity** is
therefore a dual problem concerning both the authors and the content of
knowledge, and **cannot be resolved through normative commitments
alone**]{.underline}. It is not only the voices of the colonised, but
the histories of colonialism, which have been glaring in their absence
from the discipline of International Relations. [**Overcoming
eurocentricity** therefore **requires** not only concerted effort from
the centre to create space and listen to hitherto marginalised voices,
but also **commitment to correcting the flaws in prevailing knowledge**
-- and it is **not only 'the Other' who can and should elaborate this
critique**]{.underline}. A vitally important implication of objectivity
is that **[it is the responsibility of European and American, just as
much as non-American or non-European scholars, to decolonise
IR]{.underline}**. [The importance of objectivity]{.underline} in social
inquiry defended here [can]{.underline} perhaps [be seen as a form of
epistemological internationalism]{.underline}. [It is not necessary to
be African to attempt to tell a more accurate account of the history of
Europe's role in the making of the contemporary Africa]{.underline} and
the rest of the world, for example, [or to write counter-histories of
'the]{.underline} expansion of international society' which detail the
[systematic barbarity of]{.underline} so-called [Western
civilisation]{.underline}. It is not necessary to have been colonised to
recognise and document the violence, racism, genocide and dispossession
which have characterised European expansion over five hundred years.

### T/N -- Objectivity Good

#### The scientific truths that undergird our scholarship are real -- [poststructuralism is coopted]{.underline} by corporations and post-truth politicians to [worse]{.underline} material effect than anything we said and turns ALT solvency

Half a century ago, [constructionist claims played an important role in
[**critical scholarship**, showing]{.mark} how **analytical categories**
we take for granted as **universal truths** did not exist in other times
and places, and exposing how these categories were **exploited by elites
to exercise power** (e.g. **Foucault**]{.underline}, 1971). [Authors
like]{.underline} Wittgenstein, Benveniste [and **Lacan** exposed the
[articulations between **language** and **the way we understand
reality**, putting into question]{.mark} dominant forms of **realism**
that magnified the absolute and **[universal]{.mark}** character of
**[scientific truths]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this line of reasoning,
[intellectuals associated [with]{.mark} postmodern]{.underline}1 [and
[**post-structuralist** thinking]{.mark}, like]{.underline} Barthes,
**[Derrida]{.underline}**, Kristeva, **[Foucault]{.underline}**,
**[Deleuze]{.underline}**, **[Baudrillard]{.underline}**, Jameson, and
Lyotard [challenged established beliefs surrounding **scientific
panaceas** and the dogmas of modernity. In doing so they contributed to
erode beliefs in certainties, allegedly emanating from reason, that
**shielded the exercise of power** by endowing it with the
**unquestionable authority** of **scientific truth**]{.underline}.

[The **deconstructionist machinery** set in motion by these authors,
however, soon **[proved double edged]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Naïve
realism --the original target of this criticism-- fell in disgrace and
social constructionism gradually became the mainstream in cultural
studies. Eventually, and with some support of the media, vulgarized
variants of this criticism contributed to expand a generalized climate
of moral relativism, skepticism and cynicism that, in words by Lévy
(1987: 20), installed us in an obsessively modest way of thinking that
makes of uncertainty its last word, and which 'extreme relativism has
resulted in a generalized idiocy' (cited in Naredo, 2015). In another
critical account Sahlins (2002: 49) notes that 'one of the more poignant
aspects of the current postmodernist mood is the way it seems to
lobotomize some of our best graduate students, to stifle their
creativity for fear of making some interesting structural connection
\[...\] or a comparative generalization. The only safe essentialism left
to them is that there is no order to culture'. Critics suggest that
[epistemic relativisms that reduce interpretations of reality to mere
'narratives', 'discourses' and 'social constructs' have been
instrumental for today's generalized skepticism and
cynicism]{.underline} (Boghossian, 2007; Sokal & Bricmont, 1999; Zerzan,
1994). Naredo (2015) further notes that [[this **epistemic
climate**]{.mark}, initially **[conceived as]{.mark} a healthy
[critique]{.mark}** to established ideas, later [came to be **exploited
by the s**]{.mark}**tatus [quo]{.mark}** [to **mask** the **dark sides
of progress**]{.mark} --such as **[environmental destruction]{.mark}**
from economic growth--, behind a nebulous of uncertainty]{.underline}.
[Decades of **scholarship** devoted to **deconstruct 'truth'** [**paved
the way** for]{.mark} a golden era of]{.underline} relativism.
**[[Post-truth]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a concept used to describe the
disappearance of shared objective standards for truth and the
undifferentiated blurring of facts, values, knowledge, opinion, and
belief that characterizes today's intellectual climate (Biesecker,
2018), may be looked at as the ultimate Frankenstein of this
**[epistemological drift]{.underline}**. According to Frankfurt (2005:
16), --who foresaw the post-truth coming long ago: '[The **contemporary
proliferation of bullshit** has deeper **sources** in various forms of
skepticism [which **deny that we can have**]{.mark} **any reliable
[access to an objective reality]{.mark}**]{.underline}'.

Today [this **intellectual climate** is [successfully **exploited by
business power**]{.mark} that, in the name of progress and growth,
**[manufacture doubt]{.mark}** and uncertainty [to]{.mark} **prevent**
the **precautionary principle** and **[undermine environmental
regulations]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Harremo€es et al., 2013; Michaels &
Jones, 2005; Oreskes & Conway, 2010). [In an era of **ecological
breakdown** and **post-truth**, caricaturizing limits as
fanaticism]{.underline} (Bruckner, 2013; Phillips, 2015) [or
**[banalizing]{.mark}** their **[relevance as mere]{.mark}**
'constructs' or [**'discourses'**, **serves the denialism of corporate
power** and]{.mark} the **[new authoritarianism]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
To Latour's assertion that 'context stinks' (2005: 148, citing
Koolhaas), [in today's post truth era time may be ripe to add that
'**(de)constructionism stinks**' too.]{.underline}

[With regard to ontological security, the distinction between security
and insecurity is]{.underline} the more **[critical]{.underline}** one.
[In a state of **ontological insecurity**, the Self experiences
**instability**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[uncertainty of
being]{.underline}**. [Ontological insecurity refers to a]{.underline}
[state of **disruption**]{.underline} [where the Self has **lost its
anchor**]{.underline} [for the definition of its identity]{.underline}
[and,]{.underline} consequently, [its ability to sustain a narrative and
answer questions about doing, acting, and being (]{.underline}Kinnvall
2004). It may arise from deep uncertainty (Mitzen 2006a) and/or from the
failure to have its sense of Self affirmed by others (Zarakol 2010).
[Conversely, in a state of ontological security, the Self experiences a
**stable**, **certain**, and **consistent** social
existence]{.underline}, [where it remains in control about its identity
and capacity for action]{.underline}. While I do not rule out the
possibility of a state of ontological asecurity, where the Self is
simply not concerned with the stability and certainty of its identity, I
do not explore this possibility and how it varies across different
states of physical security in this article.

Having identified different states of physical and ontological security,
I make the further assumption that [since **ontological** and
**physical** security]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[distinct]{.underline}**, [states of security do not vary
**uniformly** across the ontological and physical layers of
security.]{.underline} [One can be at a state of physical insecurity
while being at a state of ontological security, and vice
versa.]{.underline} Consequently, Table 1 charts out the four possible
states of security based on the conception of security as both
ontological and physical.

[The [state of **ontological
insecurity**]{.mark}]{.underline}[/[physical
(in)security]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is]{.mark} one [where]{.mark} [the
Self experiences concern about]{.mark} **[physical
harm]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**[and]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and uncertainty [of its
**being**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Ontological insecurity [**tempts
actors** to]{.mark} engage in practices that [mark Others as]{.mark} not
only **different**]{.underline}, [but also as **[morally
inferior]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[threatening]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Campbell 1992).
**[[Ontological]{.mark} insecurity [and physical (in)security reproduce
one another]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[As actors **seek ontological
security**]{.mark} through **constructing Others as
threats**]{.underline} [to their security-as-survival]{.underline},
[[they **mobilise**]{.mark} **their [physical
defences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} the **[pursuit of physical
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} [through representing the sources of
threat as **different** and **morally inferior.**]{.underline}

[Similarly, in a state of ontological security/physical (in)security,
actors experience stability and certainty of being in a relationship

[[into]{.underline} **[conflict-producing routines]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[maintain their certainty of

such as in Cyprus and Israel/Palestine, this state of security sustains
a stable Self/Other relationship based on enemy roles. [When in such a
state of security, minority and majority groups, migrants and host
societies perceive and represent each other's identities as radically
different and inherently incompatible, and reproduce these perceptions
and representations through acts of securitisation]{.underline} [in
order to **ensure their ontological security**.]{.underline} The states
of ontological insecurity/physical (in)security and ontological
security/physical (in)security are both securitised states; however,
whereas the former compels actors to construct new narratives of
difference and threat and engage in the securitisation of new issues to
regain their certainty and stability of being, the latter compels actors
to reproduce the existing narratives and continue the securitisation of
existing differences and conflicts to maintain it.

[[The state of **ontological security**/**physical asecurity**

#### [Hybrid warfare]{.underline} in particular [disrupts]{.underline} NATO's [ontological security]{.underline} -- the AFF [solves]{.underline} by [insulating NATO]{.underline} from [existential fear]{.underline}

[Hybrid warfare indicates a **multitude** of possible
**contingencies**]{.underline}, [generating anxiety about one's ability
to **remain oneself**]{.underline} and to continue to act. [It is thus
linked to "anxiety over the **vulnerability of \[Western\]
power**]{.underline}" (Bell 2012, pp. 230--231), [threatening the West
about losing its particularistic **form of existence**]{.underline} (cf.
Creppell 2011, p. 455). Anxiety, in contrast to fear, which per Giddens
(1991, p. 43) constitutes a response to a specific threat, concerns
"perceived threats to the integrity of the security system of the
individual" (Giddens 1991, pp. 44--45, cf. Browning and Joenniemi 2017,
p. 38; Rumelili 2015). [OS-seeking aims to **mitigate the effects** of
such hard uncertainty, **bringing it within bearable
limits**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 346). **[Routines]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[instrumental]{.underline}** [here, as they
"**pacify the cognitive environment**]{.underline} ... '**[inoculating'
individuals against paralytic, deep fear of chaos]{.underline}**"
(Mitzen 2006, p. 347).

[Being able to **survive** the "hybrid threats" is **directly
pertinent** to the survival of]{.underline} the EU and
**[NATO]{.underline}** [as particular kinds of organisations,
underpinned and **driven by specific values**]{.underline} -- [which
cannot be sacrificed or diluted in the struggle for physical and
institutional survival]{.underline}. [Yet, hybrid warfare disturbs **the
OS**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} the EU and [NATO]{.underline} in
subtly distinct ways. Due to the particularities of their institutional
set-ups and historical foundations, the OS drives of the two
organisations are somewhat distinctive. NATO's history is occasionally
told through its surpassing of a sequence of crises, albeit the end of
the Cold War and the collapse of its original enemy created a situation
of unprecedented uncertainty and ontological insecurity for the
Alliance. Meanwhile, the EU's ontological insecurity is a more recent
phenomenon, stemming mostly from the Eurocrisis and the looming
possibility of a Grexit a few years ago; the refugee/migration crisis in
Europe of 2015 (Dingott Alkhoper 2018; Mitzen 2018); the actual UK
decision on Brexit in 2016 (Browning 2018); and the rise of populist
politics within the EU (Kinnvall, Manners, Mitzen 2018) and the United
States. [NATO as a military alliance has been historically more
accustomed to the othering practices of **concrete geographical
places**]{.underline}, whereas the EU is generally regarded as an
organisation that has risen above geopolitical othering, juxtaposing
itself to Europe's dark past instead (Rumelili 2018, Subotic 2018, and
Della Sala 2018). Accordingly, the EU might be more at home with hybrid
threat management due to its historically broader conceptualisation of
security through the paradigm of intertwined risks rather than being
focused more strictly on "the threat, use and control of military force"
in the manner of a traditional defence alliance (Walt 1991, p. 212;
Manners 2002). Regardless of its perpetual transformer's self-image,
[[hybrid threats represent]{.mark} the uncomfortable "hard" or
"[**fundamental**" uncertainty for NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Mitzen
2006, p. 346) [[and are]{.mark} thus [**ontologically disturbing** for
the security of **its self** as a **traditional alliance**]{.mark} [with
a **collective security pledge** bound to **"armed
attack"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against one or more of its member
states]{.underline}.

[[In order to achieve OS, actors strive for **"routinizing**
]{.mark}**their [relations with]{.mark} significant
[others"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 342).
**[[Routines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [help to **[keep ontological fears
at bay]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [out of **everyday discursive
consciousness**]{.underline} (Mitzen 2006, p. 348). From this
perspective, NATO's naming and shaming strategy vis-à-vis Russia as part
of its hybrid warfare countering strategy links the uncertainty
emanating from the hybrid nature of the new threats to the known and
routine relationship with its traditional antagonist.8 The
incapacitating [[difficulties related to **planning ahead**]{.underline}
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} [**anticipating** and]{.underline}
[**[countering]{.underline}** [hybrid engagements
are]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [somewhat
**[alleviated]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} latter's [attachment to a **known
rival**]{.underline}. [Russia's hybrid intervention in Ukraine has
concurrently provided NATO with the familiar parameters of the cognitive
"cocoon]{.underline}" (Giddens 1991, pp. 39--40) [which enables the
alliance to **reproduce its cognitively "knowable" world**]{.underline}.
A Mitzenian reading of NATO's emerging response to hybrid
threats/warfare thus points at the renewed routinisation of the
"programmed cognitive and behavioral responses" to Russia as the
alliance's original nemesis.

Restoring traditional vigilance vis-à-vis Russia, buttressing the
forward defence along the Alliance's eastern flank with the respective
military reinforcements, **[[contingency planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and exercises, [the emerging response of NATO to the hybrid menace could
also be read [as a]{.mark}n []{.mark}**attempted [restoration of a known
normative order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the North Atlantic
Alliance]{.underline}. [Hybrid warfare endangers the basic features of
the said normative order]{.underline} (or that of the broadly conceived
Western security community in general, including the EU as well) as its
efficient countering would likely compromise the underlying principles
for this order's particularistic existence (cf. Creppell 2011, p. 450).
As a threat of subversion, [hybrid warfare exposes the internal
vulnerabilities in the body of the traditional security alliance
(NATO)]{.underline} and a self-proclaimed post-modern security actor
(i.e. the EU; cf. Cooper 2004). This concerns, in particular, the
ever-elusive (and contested) balance between national/organisational
security and individual liberties (cf. Waldron 2003, Neocleous 2007), as
strategic communication is inherently at odds with free speech as a core
value of Western liberalism. Countering hybrid warfare is conducive of
generating a security predicament of perpetual pre-emption which, by
definition, would indicate pre-emptive gathering of all sorts of data,
thus likely infringing on the privacy of the individuals for the sake of
the organisational/regional/national security. This precautionary logic
resonates with the risk society approach which characterises the
struggling with a sheer volume of risks with potentially fundamental
consequences as a key feature of modernity, implying that "decisions are
... made not in context of certainty, nor even of available knowledge,
but of doubt, premonition, foreboding, challenge, mistrust, fear, and
anxiety" (Ewald 2002, p. 294).

Securitization theory has rightly garnered much attention among European
scholars of international relations. Its basic claims are powerful: that
security threats are not given, but require active construction; that
the boundaries of "security" are malleable; that the declaration that a
certain problem lies within the realm of security is itself a productive
political act; and that "security" issues hold a trump card, demanding
disproportionate resources and silencing alternative perspectives.
Securitization thus highlights a familiar, even ubiquitous, political
process that had received little attention in the international
relations or comparative foreign policy literatures. It gave scholars a
theoretical language, if not quite a set of coherent theoretical tools,
with which to make sense of how a diverse set of issues, from migration
to narcotics flows to global climate change, sometimes came to be
treated as matters of national and global security and thereby---and
this is where securitization's critical edge came to the fore---impeded
reasoned political debate. No surprise that, as Jarrod and Eric observe,
securitization has been the focus of so many articles in the EJIR---and
even more in such journals as the Review of International Studies and
Security Dialogue. But [there are (good) substantive and]{.underline}
(not so good) [sociological reasons that **[securitization has failed to
gain traction in North America]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, and [most
important, securitization describes a process but leaves us well short
of (a) a fully specified causal theory that (b) takes proper account of
the politics of rhetorical contestation]{.underline}. According to the
foundational theorists of the Copenhagen School, actors, usually elites,
transform the social order from one of normal, everyday politics into a
Schmittian world of crisis by identifying a dire threat to the political
community. [They conceive of this "securitizing move" in linguistic
terms, as a speech act]{.underline}. As Ole Waever (1995: 55) argues,
"By saying it \[security\], something is done (as in betting, a promise,
naming a ship). . . . \[T\]he word 'security' is the act . . ."
\[emphasis added\]. Securitization is a powerful discursive process that
constitutes social reality. Countless articles and books have traced
this process, and its consequences, in particular policy domains.
[Securitization presents itself as a **[causal]{.mark}** account. But
its [**mechanisms remain obscure**, as do]{.mark} the
**[conditions]{.mark}** under which it operates]{.underline}. Why is
speaking security so powerful? [How do mere words twist and transform
the social order? Does the invocation of security prompt a visceral
emotional response? Are speech acts persuasive, by using well-known
tropes to convince audiences that they must seek protection? Or does
securitization operate through the politics of rhetorical coercion,
silencing potential opponents? In securitization accounts, **[speech
acts]{.mark}** often [seem]{.mark} to be [**magical incantations** that
upend normal politics]{.mark} through pathways shrouded in
mystery]{.underline}. [Equally unclear is why **[some]{.mark}**
securitizing moves [resonate]{.mark}, while [others \[are
**ignored**]{.mark}\]]{.underline} fall on deaf ears. [Certainly not all
attempts to construct threats succeed]{.underline}, and this is true of
both traditional military concerns as well as "new" security issues.
[Both neoconservatives and structural realists in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [have long insisted that
**conflict with China is inevitable**, yet China has over the last **25
years** been more opportunity than threat in US political
discourse---**despite** these **vigorous and persistent securitizing
moves**]{.underline}. [In very recent years, the balance has shifted,
and the China threat has started to catch on: **[linguistic processes
alone cannot account]{.mark} for this change**]{.underline}. The US
military has repeatedly declared that global climate change has profound
implications for national security---but that has hardly cast aside
climate change deniers, many of whom are ironically foreign policy hawks
supposedly deferential to the uniformed military. Authoritative speakers
have varied in the efficacy of their securitizing moves. While George W.
Bush powerfully framed the events of 9/11 as a global war against
American values, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a more gifted orator,
struggled to convince a skeptical public that Germany presented an
imminent threat to the United States. [After thirty years as an active
research program, securitization theory has **hardly begun to offer
acceptable answers** to these questions. **[Brief references to
"facilitating conditions" won't cut it]{.mark}**. You don't have to
subscribe to a covering-law conception of theory to find these questions
important or to find securitization's answers unsatisfying]{.underline}.
A large part of the problem, we believe, lies in securitization's
silence on the politics of security. Its foundations in speech act
theory have yielded an oddly apolitical theoretical framework. In its
seminal formulation, the Copenhagen school emphasized the internal
linguistic rules that must be followed for a speech act to be recognized
as competent. Yet as Thierry Balzacq argues, [by treating securitization
as a purely rule-driven process]{.underline}, the Copenhagen school
[ignores the politics of securitization]{.underline}, reducing "security
to a conventional procedure such as marriage or betting in which the
'felicity circumstances' (conditions of success) must fully prevail for
the act to go through" (2005:172). [[Absent]{.mark} from this picture
[are]{.mark} fierce rhetorical battles, [where **coalitions counter
securitizing moves**]{.mark} with their own appeals that strike more or
less deeply at underlying narratives. Absent as well are the [public
intellectuals and media, who]{.mark} **question and [critique]{.mark}**
securitizing moves]{.underline} sometimes (and not others), [sometimes
to good effect (and sometimes with little impact)]{.underline}. [[The
**audience**]{.mark} itself---whether the mass public or a narrower
elite stratum---[is **stripped of**]{.mark} **all
[agency]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Speaking security]{.mark}, even when
the performance is competent, **[does not sweep this politics
away]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Only by delving into this politics can we
shed light on the mysteries of securitization. We see rhetorical
politics as constituted less by singular "securitizing moves" than by
"contentious conversation"---to use Charles Tilly's phrase. To this end,
we would urge securitization theorists, as we recently have elsewhere,
to move towards a "pragmatic" model that rests on four analytical
wagers: that actors are both strategic and social; that legitimation
works by imparting meaning to political action; that legitimation is
laced through with contestation; and that the power of language emerges
through contentious dialogue. We are heartened that our ambivalence
about securitization---the ways in which we find it by turns appealing
and dissatisfying---and our vision for how to move forward have in the
last decade been echoed by (mostly) European colleagues. These critics
have laid out a research agenda that would, if taken up, produce more
satisfying, and more deeply political, theoretical accounts. In our own
work, both individual and collective, we have tried to advance that
research agenda. So long as securitization theorists resist defining the
theory's scope and mechanisms, and so long as it remains wedded to
apolitical underpinnings, we think it unlikely to gain a broad following
on this side of the pond. [Second, securitization has been held back by
another way in which it is apolitical]{.underline}---this time thanks to
its Schmittian commitments and political vision. [Successful
securitization, in seminal accounts, replaces normal patterns of
politics with the world of the exception]{.underline}, in which contest
has no place. [They imagine security as the ultimate trump card. But, in
reality, the divide is not nearly so stark. Security **[does not crowd
out]{.mark} all [other spending priorities]{.mark}**---or states would
spend on nothing but defense and "securitized" issues. **[Nor]{.mark}**
does simply declaring something a matter of national security
**[guarantee]{.mark} its [funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}---or global
climate change counter-measures, including research on renewable
energies, would be well-funded. [Nor are security issues somehow aloof
from politics: politics has never truly stopped "at the water's edge."
Securitization considers only the politics of security. Its strangely
dichotomous optic cannot see or make sense of the politics within
security]{.underline}. In ignoring the politics within security,
securitization is of course in good company. Realists of all stripes
have paid little attention to domestic political contest, except as a
distraction from structural imperatives. But while realism is
unquestionably a powerful first-cut, [this inattention to the politics
within security is also among the reasons so many have found it
wanting]{.underline}. As Arnold Wolfers long ago observed, some degree
of insecurity is the normal state of affairs. But "some may find the
danger to which they are exposed entirely normal and in line with their
modest security expectations while others consider it unbearable to live
with these same dangers." And states, he further argues, do not actually
maximize security---almost ever. "Even when there has been no question
that armaments would mean more security, the cost in taxes, the
reduction in social benefits, or the sheer discomfort involved have
militated effectively against further effort" (1962:151, 153). [A
securitization perspective renders all this politics within security
inexplicable. And yet]{.underline}, as Wolfers saw half a century ago,
[it is crucial]{.underline}.

[A securitizing move is]{.underline}, according to the original
definition by the Copenhagen School, a specific rhetorical structure or
discourse -- or, more precisely, [[a speech act]{.mark} -- that
[frames]{.mark} an issue [as an **existential
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}, i.e., a security issue (Buzan, Wæver, and
de Wilde 1998: 25--26). The central goal of this chapter is the
identification and analysis of such speech acts because [speech acts
have indeed been the main means by which the Campaign has increasingly
sought [to **securitize AWS**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since other means
have also been employed, we will draw intellectual resources from other
approaches to securitization theory too. There is still more, however,
that we can borrow from the Copenhagen School. Wæver (1995) pointed to
the performative dimension of the move: 'the utterance itself is the act
\[emphasis added\]'. He even defined the process as '\[t\]he performance
of the security act'. Huysmans (2006: 147) accurately spotted the
linguistic practice turning from mere description to performative acts
as one of the organizing principles in social and political relations.
One important caveat is that performativity is not the same thing as a
theatre performance, but is about the ways in which the discourse is
reiterated and networks are created (Ringmar 2019). In this chapter, we
systematically illustrate how a particular communication within a
distributed network produces and reinforces a shared understanding of
insecurity. What deserves special note is that [the emergent security
issue is not necessarily linked to a real existential threat but has to
be constructed and presented as such a threat]{.underline} (Buzan,
Wæver, and de Wilde 1998: 24). There have been insights showing that it
does not stop with a politically and socially constructed threat.
[Discourses of insecurity are often about representations of 'danger'
with material consequences]{.underline} (Campbell 1992). This concept is
important for us too because the kind of threat we examine here has been
constructed through, inter alia, discourses and representations of
danger.

A person or a group that performs the speech act is a securitizing
actor. Success depends to a great extent on the authority position held
by the actor. Only a few actors and groups do in fact have 'the power to
define security'. Among them are political leaders, governments,
bureaucracies, lobbyists, and pressure groups (Buzan, Wæver, and de
Wilde 1998: 31 and 40). Therefore, the Copenhagen School gave us a hint
as to the nature of securitizing actors. Wæver (1995: 57) insisted
specifically, however, that 'security is articulated only from a
specific place, in an institutional voice, \[typically\] by elites'.
Buzan, Wæver, and de Wilde (1998: 21) reaffirmed the principle in their
joint book: 'Traditionally, by saying "security," a state representative
\[emphasis added\] declares an emergency condition.' The limitation of
the approach of the Copenhagen School is that it restricts the actors
who can legitimately construct security primarily to political leaders.
Also, the Copenhagen School provided initial instruction on how to
assess the role the audience plays in constructing insecurity, yet this
is another limitation. Success, in their view, depends on the audience
being convinced that the issue is an existential security threat. The
issue is securitized only if and when emergency measures that go beyond
standard political procedures are accepted as justified (Buzan, Wæver,
and de Wilde 1998: 23--25). The audience's role is, therefore, limited
to the mere fact of their accepting the truth of the discourse. Other
approaches to securitization theory will allow us to compensate for
these limits.

Another major contributor to securitization theory has been the Paris
School, situated within the emerging field of international political
sociology and mainly represented by Didier Bigo and Thierry Balzacq.
Their ideas further advanced the understanding of securitizing actors
endowed with the authority to securitize. New actors appeared on the
stage who were professionals with expertise in a given field. The Paris
School put emphasis on expert security knowledge and the 'authority of
statistics' (Bigo 2006). Security professionals and security agencies,
the ones who routinely collect and analyse data, were recognized as
having the authority to determine what exactly constitutes security
(Bigo 2000: 176). Particular attention was drawn to bureaucracies that
serve as an 'intermediary' with the central government and are directly
involved in the provision of security services (e.g., military and
police services, border guards and customs agents, intelligence
services, risk assessment experts, etc.) (Bigo 2006). Increasingly,
security professionals, both researchers and military personnel, are
becoming facilitators for the success of securitization, as we show in
this chapter. Bigo (2002: 83) specifically highlighted that, even if
NGOs intervene, 'they can do so only by turning professional'. Our
analysis here illustrates, among other things, the trend towards
professionalization in NGOs, themselves collecting, distributing, and
efficiently utilizing professional knowledge. The success of the
securitizing move is, consequently, linked to the structural position of
the speaker within a relevant institution (Bigo 2002: 73--74). Bigo
(2006) also noted that such institutions can overstep national
boundaries and form transnational bureaucratic links.
Transnationalization represents, in his view, yet another source of
knowledge and 'symbolic' power. The transnational advocacy Campaign to
Stop Killer Robots, which is the focus of this chapter, is perhaps the
best illustration of how it can play out in everyday practice. Balzacq
(2005: 178--179) listed the very same attributes of authorized security
speakers: knowledge, trust, and the speaker's power position, formal or
symbolic. One of his key points was that 'effective securitization is
power-laden'. In addition, he carved out a more central role for the
audience, focusing on 'the power \[emphasis added\] that both speaker
and listener bring to the interaction' (Balzacq 2005: 171--172). This
insight is still not enough to accurately define the role of the
audience for the purposes of this chapter, but it brings us closer to
the task.

The conceptualization of the securitizing move itself extends beyond the
single speech act, as claimed by the Paris School. Bigo (2002: 65--66)
stressed the importance of bureaucratic practices performed by security
professionals and involved in the creation of administrative knowledge
(e.g., population profiling, risk assessment, statistical calculation,
category creation, proactive preparation, etc.). Therefore, practical
work, discipline, and expertise are certainly no less important than the
discourse (Bigo 2000: 194). Here we concentrate less on bureaucratic
practices and more on different discursive frames in play. However, we
still note, for example, that the Campaign has also drawn quite heavily
upon surveys done by the market research company Ipsos. The most
significant observation that comes out of it, however, is different: the
Paris School broadened the definition of the securitizing move beyond
the single, typically political, speech act. Balzacq (2005: 191) also
focused on the 'manner' in which the securitizing actor makes the case
for the point and drew attention to two basic principles ensuring
ultimate success: 'emotional intensity' and 'logical rigor'. He also
reminded us of the role of analogies, metaphors, stereotypes,
metonymies, lies, gestures, and even silence as effective tools of
persuasion (Balzacq 2005: 172 and 179). In this chapter, we illustrate
the significance of such tools for creating the terrifying image of
'killer robots'. The increasingly blurred lines between fact and
fiction, rationality and emotion are of particular significance to our
understanding of that image. Last, but not least, the Paris School
pointed to the existence of numerous stakeholders with heterogeneous
profiles who do not share the same logics and are often in competition
with each other (Bigo 2006). In such 'power struggles', securitizing
actors align to eliminate alternative voices and swing the audience's
support towards their preferred course of action (Balzacq 2005: 173 and
179). It is a relevant observation, but a careful analysis of such
struggles between the ban Campaign and its opponents is the subject of
the next chapter.

Other, especially more [recent, supplements to securitization theory
contributed to the development of a more sophisticated set of
assumptions regarding the authority of securitizing actors and the
practice of **threat construction**]{.underline}. Stritzel (2012: 553)
summarized the general tendency as the development away from static
understandings of the authority to securitize and single speech acts to
more complex processes of authorization and more dynamic representations
of existential threat. Pointing out such complexities is one of the key
objectives we set for ourselves in this chapter. Vuori (2008: 76)
assumed that even those actors who fall outside official authority, but
have sufficient 'social capital', can become securitizing actors. Social
capital is a special kind of asset available, for example, to NGOs. In
this chapter, we deal directly and specifically with the ways in which
such capital is being mobilized. [Berling]{.underline} (2011: 386)
convincingly [[argued]{.underline}]{.mark}, in addition, [that science
co-determines the status of the securitizing actor]{.underline}. He
called it [[the **'authority of objectivity'**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Berling 2011: 393). Brauch (2009: 94) also drew attention to the
significance of scientific 'reputation'. Unsurprisingly, then, there is
a strong focus on raising a scientific profile within -- and in
association with -- the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. This is
achieved, inter alia, by joining forces with senior scientists and
larger scientific communities. The so-called ['epistemic communities'
can indeed draw on their knowledge [and **expertise**]{.mark} to
[influence the outcome of **securitization moves**]{.mark} 'through
reason and facts on the basis of **(objective) knowledge**']{.underline}
(Floyd 2020: 12). An epistemic community is a network of professionals
from a variety of disciplines with recognized scientific expertise and
competence in a particular domain, according to the original
conceptualization of the term (Haas 1992: 3). Haas (1992: 18)
conceptualized epistemic communities as a separate category, inherently
distinct from interest groups, social movements, and bureaucratic
coalitions. Even though he equipped us with the appropriate concept, the
definition is problematic. It is increasingly difficult to draw
definitive dividing lines between scientists, political activists, and
activist bureaucrats, as we clearly show here. [A closer look reveals
two serious problems: scientific facts are selectively used, twisted, or
suppressed by political activists to serve their political purpose; and
scientists themselves become willingly and directly involved in policy
making and political manipulation]{.underline}. Berling (2011: 392)
[assumed that 'scientific capital' co-determines 'the
hierarchy]{.underline} \[emphasis added\] [in the field of security and
the chances of winning'. **[Yet the opposite is the case]{.mark}** in
this chapter. [**Hierarchies** are being **replaced** with **more
horizontal heterarchies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as we will demonstrate.
Science contributes significantly to the chances of success [[and
**successful claims for legitimacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but
scientists [[do **not**]{.mark} necessarily [**play a central role**
in]{.mark} the process of **[securitization]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There has, at the same time, been greater awareness that the audience
can reinforce the authority of the securitizing actor. Salter (2008:
321--322) conceptualized interactions between the securitizing actor and
the audience as 'iterative'. He studied the process of 'audience-speaker
co-constitution \[emphasis added\] of authority and knowledge'. McInnes
and Rushton (2011: 117) even introduced the idea that original audiences
can, at some points themselves, act as securitizing actors. These
insights help us conceptualize and, more importantly, analyse [a much
more active engagement on the part of the audience and the increasingly
blurred line between securitizing actors and their target
audiences]{.underline}. [We call]{.underline} it
**[hybridization]{.underline}**, as explained below, and show how it
works in practice. We also clearly demonstrate that such hybridization
has no clear boundaries. Floyd (2020) drew our attention to the role of
'functional actors', often confused with the audience but, in fact,
seeking to positively or negatively influence the trajectory of
securitization. The concept itself, though originally underdeveloped, is
borrowed from the Copenhagen School. Floyd (2020: 10) stressed that
media outlets can prioritize certain issues over others, decide how
information is relayed, and, therefore, control what becomes public
knowledge. Vultee (2011: 77--93) showed practically how the media 'speak
security'. Our intention through this text is to once again demonstrate
that the media play a crucial role in shaping public threat perception
and disseminating stereotypes. [The very idea of 'killer robots' caught
public attention and imagination through broad media coverage. Foreign
politicians can, in turn, either provide or withhold external
legitimation]{.underline}, according to Floyd (2020: 10). [[The **most
important consequence**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as we show, [[is **peer
pressure**]{.mark}, i.e., attempts by the truly pro-ban [states]{.mark}
to **[push the blocking coalition towards adopting the ban on
AWS]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Members employed in the relevant industry
can equally facilitate or impede securitization by presenting reasoned
arguments for one side or the other (Floyd 2020: 11). We have a perfect
illustration here: many technology companies have supported the Campaign
to Stop Killer Robots and publicly committed not to engage in the
development of AWS. Clearly, such statements have significantly
strengthened the spirit of the Campaign. Floyd's (2020: 12)
interpretation also suggests that even ordinary people can affect the
dynamics of securitization, for example, through social media activism.
Here we illustrate how ordinary people can facilitate securitization by
partaking in surveys and voicing their concerns about the perceived
threat. We also highlight that the Campaign has closely aligned with a
broad wave of public concern, which has further reinforced its
legitimacy in the eyes of the general public.

Numerous studies have also sought to develop a more nuanced
understanding of the core of securitizing moves. First of all, there has
been a general awareness that scientific models, data, and facts 'can be
mobilized strategically' (Berling 2011: 393). Stritzel (2012: 560)
explored the link between power politics and popular culture as 'a
principal background of meaning'. In particular, he inquired into the
use of pop culture and cultural myths by securitizing actors. Williams
(2003: 526--527) suggested that images and other visual representations
are also part of 'a broader performative act' and do play a significant
role in the process of securitization. This chapter shows how scientific
facts and cultural imaginaries, visual and discursive frames are all
mobilized simultaneously to construct the threat of so-called killer
robots. Some scholars have even sought to highlight the supposed links
between different security agendas such as the 'migration-terrorism
nexus' (Ihlamur-Öner 2019), the 'terrorism-asylum nexus', or even the
'terrorism-immigration-asylum nexus' (Tsoukala 2006: 612 and 618). This
is an important, yet undeveloped, argument. It is a good starting point
for us to properly conceptualize processes of grafting involved in a
securitizing move, as further elaborated below. [Salter]{.underline}
(2012: 934), at the same time, [reminds us of the fact that
'[**securitization** is a **constant process** of]{.mark} struggle and
**[contestation]{.mark}**']{.underline}. In accord with his
interpretation, [the so-called securitizing move in fact [consists of
'**overlapping**]{.mark} ... **[language security games]{.mark}**
performed [by **varying**]{.mark} **relevant
[actors]{.mark}**']{.underline} (Salter 2012: 931). The same author
noted elsewhere (2008: 321) that there are also distinct types of
audiences and that the move may be successful with some of them, but not
others. It is a reminder for us: systematic hybridization between
different types of actors acting at different stages in the
securitization process, as we illustrate, does not necessarily lead to
greater homogenization. We show it here too.

Building on this rich and diverse body of knowledge, the insights we
borrow primarily include the significance of scientific reputation, the
varied and dynamic identities of securitizing actors, the increasingly
blurred line between securitizing actors and their target audiences, and
the diversity of ways in which the threat can be constructed and
presented. Yet we also go beyond to inquire into the process of
over-securitization. There have already been efforts to understand and
theorize over-securitization, so the term itself is not new. However,
the existing literature approaches the problem from the perspective of
referent objects of security. Hammerstad (2008: 1--2) was the first to
point out that a security issue can 'become over-securitised to the
point where it is in danger of creating threats \[to the referent
object\] where before there were none'. Ihlamur-Öner (2019: 210)
concurred: 'The securitization of irregular and forced migration has
reached to the point that it can be described as over-securitization,
which creates more threats where there were none, while putting the
lives of migrants and refugee protection at risk.'

We take a different approach still and explore the dynamics of
over-securitization from the perspective of securitizing actors and
securitizing moves. In doing so, we distinguish two mechanisms through
which over-securitization operates at these two levels: hybridization
and grafting, respectively. Through the former, [we demonstrate how
complex [**hybridization** of **securitizing actors** and **target
audiences** produces]{.mark} circulatory, [**transepistemic**, and
**post-truth** configurations]{.mark} of **security**]{.underline}. When
making this argument, we are inspired by Aradau and Huysmans. They
accurately determined that ['**transepistemic relations** [create
**greater symmetry between various knowledges** and **dilute the
superior authority** of]{.mark} science in truth telling and **[factual
knowledge]{.mark}** about the world']{.underline} (Aradau and Huysmans
2018: 49). The same authors (2018: 54) defined the condition of
post-truth as 'a less hierarchical and more horizontal transversal
practice of knowledge creation and circulation'. We have a practical
illustration of their statements and argue that, when the tipping point
is reached, [the diffusion of authority [**decreases** the
**likelihood** of **successful securitization**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The concept of '**[grafting]{.mark}** \[a new norm onto existing
norms\]' stands for a well-established legal practice and]{.underline}
is borrowed from Price (1998: 617). Here it [helps us conceptualize how
a new security agenda can be grafted, through]{.underline} both
**[[discursive]{.underline}]{.mark}** and visual [[**representations**,
onto]{.mark} other security issues of immediate importance and even
**[sci]{.mark}**ence **[fi]{.mark}**ction imagery]{.underline}. [Such
grafting techniques]{.underline}, as we show, [reinforce the sense of
insecurity but, quite **[counter-intuitively]{.mark}**, can in some
cases **[impede instead of facilitate]{.mark}** the
**[securitization]{.mark}** process]{.underline}. The imprecise focus
and reductionist paths make it more difficult to name the threat
clearly, which is a precondition for successful securitization. Salter
(2012: 938--940) gave an example of what it means if 'the threat remains
vague \[emphasis added\]'.

[Here lies the paradox: [**success in broadening the stakeholder base**
and **generating the sense of insecurity** does **not**]{.mark}
necessarily [mean the **success of
securitization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a nutshell, greater efficiency
does not necessarily translate into greater effectiveness. Hence,
over-securitization is about securitization efforts that are too intense
and too ubiquitous, to the point of becoming counter-productive.

STABILITY AND CHANGE Arms Control: Conservative or Transformative? As
the \"impact" discussion indicated, [Arms Control can be looked at from
two opposite perspectives concerning stability and change. Arms control
aims at stability; **critical security approaches** have thus labeled
arms control as a **conservative, status-quo orientated
strategy**]{.underline} (**[Krause & [Cooper]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
2011; Krause & Latham, 1998). [This school has also ascribed certain
attributes of the concept to Western culture, thereby **[reifying the
West]{.mark}** as completely American **[without accounting for]{.mark}
the [considerable differences within]{.mark}** the West (which shows,
for example, in the related EU strategies]{.underline} \[EU, 2003a,
2003b, 2016\]). [In this spirit, critical scholars have [labeled as
Western]{.mark} such attributes as the "**necessity of
[deterrence]{.mark}**,\" a "preference for one\'s own
**[preponderance]{.mark}**,\" and a "focus on proliferation" **[as if
the Soviet Union had not shown the same traits]{.mark}** all throughout
the Cold War, [and]{.mark} as if **[Russia]{.mark}** had not
**[followed]{.mark}** the Soviet predecessor in this respect as
well]{.underline}. [**[But]{.mark}** there is [also]{.mark} a
transformational perspective]{.underline}: [Arms Control [as a
**vehicle** for]{.mark} inducing]{.underline}, accompanying, and
reinforcing [a fundamental **[redefinition of the relationship
between]{.mark}**]{.underline} two or more
**[[states]{.underline}]{.mark}**; the template for this approach is, as
will be discussed later, the years from 1985 to 1992, when the Cold War
dissolved. Naturally, the concept of disarmament shows the greatest
affinity to the transformational approaches. [This transformational
perspective **[leaves]{.mark} the [dogmatic]{.mark} connection between
arms control and [stability behind]{.mark}**. **[Stability by arms
control is]{.mark} itself [an instrument to foster dynamic
change]{.mark}**, just as homeostasis in young organisms is the
condition for dynamic growth]{.underline}. [This perspective opens the
broader view on the relation of Arms Control and historical time. A
reading of the history of arms control results in three models to
conceive this relationship]{.underline}. Arms Control Through Time:
Three Models. The first model corresponds to the enlightenment intuition
of steady progress: [Arms Control, once started, will **[create islands
of coop]{.mark}**eration in a still formidable sea of
self-help]{.underline}. But successful agreements [have an impact beyond
technical constraints or limited cooperation gains. The factor of
"**[learning]{.mark}**," enabled by agreements and their institutional
settings, **[changes the relationship]{.mark} between** former rivals
and **antagonists [incrementally, but]{.mark}**]{.underline} potentially
**[[profoundly]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Nye, 1989). New information
mitigates the security dilemma, as both capabilities and intentions of
the partner become better understood and more predictable. [Admitting
transparency]{.underline} on agreed level of forces, which reduce
opportunities and incentives to attack first---whether conventional or
nuclear---build down the image of the enemy as a nefarious and
implacable antagonist poised to devour neighbors and enemies. Arms
Control works as a conduit for reassurance; the reassured party imputes
more benevolent intentions on. its opposite. Institutional
settings---domestic, bilateral, and multilateral---create new
bureaucratic routines, produce more information, help to solve problems
of ambiguity and suspicions of non-compliance, and inculcate cooperative
practices in the daily work of decision makers and bureaucrats.
[Moreover, successful Arms Control agreements **set incentives to try
more daring ones**. **[In the process, states]{.mark}** might
**[redefine their]{.mark} own [security
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, Arms Control is not able to
drive this process alone. Rather, [its political effects help to
encourage steps in other areas of the conflicting relationship, arid
such steps (and their domestic repercussions) stimulate in turn new
efforts in Arms Control. Throughout this development, [increasing
**transnational communities**]{.mark} ([**epistemic** and
otherwise]{.mark}) connect the national discourses of the participating
countries by importing common knowledge, serving as interpreters of the
\'\'other's" views and actions, and working as advocates of
cooperation]{.underline} (Nye, 1987, 1989) The Gorbachev years of 1985
to 1991 provide an impressive example for this dynamic. In the best
case, it might [**[turn islands of coop]{.mark}**eration **[into a
continent]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Evangelista, 1999; Risse, 2000). The
second model is a significant modification of the first one. It
preserves the long-term vision of a cooperative world, but (informed by
[the historical experiences of [the **last 60
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}) [understands the Arms Control process as
[a series of **waves**]{.mark}, each of which leaves the world in a more
cooperative state than the previous one: a pure self-help system gives
way to an arms-control driving detente constellation, followed by a new
political ice age in which, however, some of the Arms Control
achievements of the detente period survive]{.underline}. [A second Arms
Control wave, followed by another ice age ensues, with again a few new
lasting gains for cooperative security, and so on]{.underline}. This
model [accounts for the multifactorial political environment in which
Arms Control has to operate. Power shifts among nations,]{.underline}
national revolutions, [or domestic polarization, can replace elites well
socialized into the concepts and practices of Arms Control with
nationalist, unilateralist, and supremacist elites, who see the only way
to security and status in absolute superiority or even aggression and
conquest]{.underline}. This account of **[the [process toward more
coop]{.mark}eration [through ups and downs]{.mark} reflects better the
experiences since 1960]{.underline}**. A tentative success after the
Cuban missile crisis, the Partial Test Ban Treaty, was followed by five
years of stagnation, caused by the toppling of Khrushchev in Moscow,
alienation through the Vietnam War, and the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia. The conclusion of the negotiations on the NPT toward the
end of 1968 opened the first wave of Arms Control in the period of
detente. After the--- supposedly hawkish---presidency of Richard Nixon
had installed itself, strategic arms negotiations started quickly. The
next decade saw four agreements of strategic nuclear arms, two on
testing, two multilateral treaties to prohibit biological and
environmental weapons, and a couple of confidence-building measures to
avoid severe crises between the superpowers, plus those in the context
of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE, the
"Helsinki Document"). However, this period came to a halt at the end of
the decade when conservative concerns about perceived growing Soviet
nuclear superiority and cheating, and Soviet inroads in the developing
world produced a climate no longer conducive to Arms Control---SALT II
remained observed by the two parties, but unratified. The early Reagan
years were confrontational, with unfettered armament, and token Arms
Control talks in order to pacify a concerned Western public on both
sides of the Atlantic. Gorbachev's ascendancy to power changed the
situation (Arnett, 1990; Evangelista, 1999). Starting with new CSCE
confidence-building measures in 1986 (the "Stockholm Document'\' later
dramatically enhanced by the series of "Vienna Documents"), a cascade of
bilateral (INF Treaty, START I, START II), multilateral regional (CFE
Treaty and the unprecedented Open Sky Treaty, which grants the parties
mutual information-gathering overflight rights), and multilateral global
(Chemical Weapons Convention, Ottawa Convention on anti-personal land
mines, and the indefinite extension of the NPT) measures followed in
close sequence. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was the last
hurrah, but failed to attract the necessary "advice and consent" in the
U.S. Senate, which was already dominated by archconservative forces led
by Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relation Committee. From 1997 on, the political climate cooled down.
Arms Control froze with the George W. Bush administration. The Moscow
Treaty on strategic nuclear arms---a treaty without specifications, with
a termination date of 2012 and no verification---was the only
achievement, neutralized through the far more weighty abrogation of the
ABM-Treaty by the Bush administration, which led to the prompt
abrogation of START II by Russia, followed by Moscow\'s withdrawal from
the CFE Treaty; the multilateral Oslo Convention banning cluster
munitions succeeded only because the United States, opposed to this
agreement, did not possess a veto position. Obama\'s revival of Arms
Control yielded the New START Treaty, the agreement for the reduction of
weapons-grade plutonium with Russia, and the Arms Trade Treaty, in. an
all too brief period of new detente that ended at the latest with the
Russian annexation of the Crimea in 2014. [The notion of **waves** has
[**a lot of empirical evidence** to **support**]{.mark} it]{.underline}.
One interesting indicator is the titles of writings on the subject that
have appeared over time. A Farewell to Arms Control? (Young, 1972),
\"Arms Control: The Possibility of a Second Coming" (Freedman,1982),
"Farewell to Arms Control?" again (Nye, 1986), "The Death of Arms
Control" (Sullivan, 1987), The Future of Arms Control (Ball & Mack,
1987), "The Folly of Arms Control" (Schell, 2000),7 "The Rise and Fall
of Arms Control" (Bohlen, 2005), all indicate a shifting between the
highs and lows of the theme. It also indicates that [experts did not
always agree on whether they were feeing a high or a low]{.underline}.
Young\'s book was written during the years of the first big Arms Control
wave. Freedman's \"second coming\" was authored in the first years of
the Reagan Administration's dark years for Arms Control. Nye s
"Farewell" and Sullivan\'s "Death," written from quite different
positions, appeared when Gorbachev moved Arms Control on its path of
greatest success, as acknowledged by the more optimistic Nye. Curiously,
"The Death of Deterrence" (Dando & Rogers, 1984) falls between the
"second coming\" and the \"death" of Arms Control. [That these **waves**
lead toward **ever-increased security coop**eration in a **spiral-shaped
process**, however, is not self-evident. Consequently, the third model
drafts a circular process]{.underline}. [Progress is only temporary and
will be overtaken by the eternal, harsh forces of the international
power struggle]{.underline}. [Of course, this is the view of the more
pessimistic version of realism]{.underline}: Arms Control ebbs and
floods alternate, but Arms Control achievements are fully or almost
fully lost in each ice age: ["progress" does not hold]{.underline}.
Security cooperation and its legal and institutional sediments are a
marginal phenomenon, dependent on temporary interest constellations.
When interests shift, or when a power shift changes the hierarchy of the
international system, the achievements of the past period will erode or
explode, and the system returns to the dangerous competition, including
its military aspects, which is its natural state (Mearsheimer, 1995; see
also Mearsheimer, 2001 for the theoretical background). [Among the three
models, **the "spiral model\" has most to show
empirically**]{.underline}. As Joseph Nye (1987, 1989) observed already
in 1987, [even the icy early 1980s left much of the Arms Control
achievements intact, such as the NPT, naval confidence-building
measures, and the CSCE process with its confidence-building (the
European allies prevailed over U.S. preferences)]{.underline}. [During
the George W. Bush years, NPT, CWC, and BWC continued]{.underline} (the
latter one after heroic rescue activities by the Europeans), [the mutual
reductions pursuant to the Moscow Treaty took place, the INF Treaty
remained in force, as did CSCE confidence building, and even the Open
Sky Treaty]{.underline}. The same applies to all global multilateral
treaties. A second observation: Phil Farley counted, in his contribution
to probably the best book on Arms Control that has ever been written,
[eight negotiations]{.underline} that had [failed before
1987]{.underline} (Farley, 1988, pp. 620,627-629). [During the 28 years
that have since passed, six of these eight have been successfully
concluded]{.underline}.8 Up to now, [the \"spiral model\" appears to
hold, **[despite]{.mark} setbacks in the early 1980s**, the years of the
George W. **Bush** Administration, **or [the present impasse]{.mark}**;
thus, [the **hopeful**]{.mark} Kantian [**vision** of **ever-closer
security coop**]{.mark}eration [is **still on the
table**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Permissive Effect of Prohibition Norms. [One of the criticisms of
critical security studies scholars has been that the **[prohibition of
some weapons]{.mark}** has had the effect of **[legitimizing
non-prohibited weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline} (**[Cooper]{.underline}**,
2011; **[Mathur]{.underline}**, 2011). [Indeed]{.underline}, there is
the ''permissive'' effect, which results from the [stigmatization of the
prohibited weapons as inhuman]{.underline}, which [implies in turn that
weapons not banned simultaneously are not equally inhumane]{.underline}.
[For material and psychological reasons, the focus on banning a specific
weapon system will very probable prevent efforts to ban other weapons
with comparable effects at the same time: The campaign to get rid
of]{.underline} incendiary weapons ([napalm]{.underline}) [in the 1980s
postponed action on landmines and cluster munitions for one and two
decades, respectively]{.underline}. [The material factor is the resource
restraint (financial, time, diplomatic capital) of ban
proponents]{.underline} (NGOs and like-minded governments), [which makes
it difficult to tackle more than one item at a time]{.underline}. [The
psychological effect is the impossibility of focusing and maintaining
attention of both activists and the public (media and people) on more
than one issue in a certain time-span]{.underline} (Rosert, 2015, 2016).
[[As the sequence from **incendiary**]{.mark} weapons (prohibited in
1983), [to]{.mark} anti-personal **[mines]{.mark}** (prohibited in
1997), [to **cluster munitions**]{.mark} (prohibited in 2009)
[demonstrates, however, this permissive]{.mark}/preventive [effect
is]{.mark} determining **[only temporari]{.mark}ly**]{.underline}. [In
the [**long-term**, the **opposite**]{.mark} effect can be
[observed]{.mark}, "**[issue cascading]{.mark}**": the successful
subjection on one type of weapon under the anti-humanitarian **stigma
makes it easier** for a follow-up campaign to **frame** the **next
candidate for a ban** in a way that **promises success**]{.underline}.
[The **[framing]{.mark}** of [a weapon]{.mark} type [in
**analogy**]{.mark} or comparison with an already stigmatized one
(grafting) **[becomes easier]{.mark}** as more weapons fall under a ban,
and more characteristics and attributes are available to draw parallels
to a weapon that is still permitted]{.underline} (Price, 1998, pp.
627-631). If permissive or preventive effects mean that old Arms Control
stands in the way of new Arms Control, [the cascading effect shows that
old Arms Control can engender new Arms Control]{.underline}. Real World
Effects. So far, the discussion has dealt with the effects of Arms
Control on state behavior. [Changed state behavior, of course, has
effects on the physical world: [Due to]{.mark} the implementation of
[Arms Control]{.mark} agreements, [there are fewer **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} (between 15,000 and 16,000 instead of
more than 60,000, at the height of the Cold War), [fewer
**[c]{.mark}**hemical weapons, fewer **[b]{.mark}**iological
**[w]{.mark}**eapons, and fewer states possessing nuclear, chemical, and
biological weapons in the world, [and]{.mark} fewer [conventional weapon
s]{.mark}ystems]{.underline} in Europe [than would have been the case
otherwise]{.underline}. The most impressive numbers come from
humanitarian Arms Control groups: According to the Red Cross, [[the
number of **victims of landmines**]{.mark} was at **[20,000]{.mark}**
the year before the Ottawa Convention. It has gone [**down to 3,500**
per year]{.mark} since]{.underline}. By the end of 2015, [international
production and **[transfer]{.mark}** of these weapons had commensurately
**[shrunk, including by]{.mark}** some **[non-members]{.mark}**
producers, quite **[a]{.mark} remarkable external [effect of the
norm]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[even **48 non-state**]{.mark} **armed
[groups]{.mark}** have [renounced]{.mark} the use of mines]{.underline}
on the initiative of the NGO Geneva CalL Twenty-nine states were
declared to be mine-free through efforts under the Ottawa Convention
(International Committee of the Red Cross, 2016). By the end of 2014,
3.68 million anti-personal mines had been destroyed in operations
pursuant to the Convention (Landmines Report, 2009, p. 1; Landmines
Report, 2015, p. 2). [Surprisingly, in light of **[so many lives
saved]{.mark}**, **some [scholars]{.mark}** belonging to the Critical
Security Studies school **[contend]{.mark} that [humanitarian]{.mark}
Arms [Control constitutes]{.mark} a well-concealed submission of civil
society to the imperatives of [Western militarism]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Beier, 2011; **[Cooper]{.underline}**, 2011; **[Mathur]{.underline}**,
2011, 2012, 2014). [This assessment of the mine campaign as
\"reconstitution of the West (and Western interest)" having "played a
crucial (even decisive) role in the construction of the \'landmine
crisis']{.underline}" (**[Krause]{.underline}** & Latham, 1998, p. 44)
[remains **mysterious**: First, **both** the Ottawa and the Oslo
conventions were **opposed by** the quintessential Western power, **the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [Second, both were
**enthusiastically supported** by the main **victims** of the prohibited
weapons, namely the countries from Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast
Asia]{.underline} (Price, 1998, pp. 640-641). [One could suspect that,
**[based on ideological doctrine]{.mark}**, some [scholars are
**critical of all but their own**]{.mark} perceptual
**[biases]{.mark}**, a strong [similar]{.mark}ity [to]{.mark} some of
[the]{.mark} realist and [**neo-conservative critics** of]{.mark} arms
[control]{.mark}, which [they]{.mark} so enthusiastically
[condemn]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back to the independent-dependent
variable relationship: The structurationist school of constructivism,
orientated to the work of Anthony Giddens, takes [the **middle
ground**]{.underline} by [constructing a dialectical relationship by
which processes of Arms Control and processes of broader
policy]{.underline} would [mutually influence each other]{.underline}.
As Arms Control has been conceptualized as a way to mitigate the
security dilemma, its likely effects should be tangible there. [Measures
that reduce the ambiguity of intention and capabilities, and measures
that, notably, **reduce the capability for large-scale, speedy
offensives** should have **strong positive impacts on mutual
perception** and help to **foster security cooperation on a broad
scope**]{.underline} (Peters, 1992). They give **[signals]{.underline}**
of [the **absence of aggressive intentions** and thereby help
**overcome** the fundamental **uncertainty**, which is at the heart of
the **security dilemma**]{.underline} (Lamb, 1988, pp. 225-234). The
\"Gorbachev effect" on the West was exactly that. ACADEMIC AND POLITICAL
DISCOURSES [Academic and political discourses on arms
control]{.underline}, disarmament, [and non-proliferation in
general]{.underline}, as well as in specific political fields of action,
[are framed in four different perspectives: deterrence, defense,
disarmament, and humanitarian discourses]{.underline}.2 The deterrence
approach is dominated by nuclear weapons: The regulation of arms is seen
as maintaining a stable deterrence relationship, understood as the
mutually assured capability to strike back after a first strike,
accompanied by measures that make a first strike as unlikely,
unprovoked, and unattractive as possible. Consequently, nuclear weapons,
seen as embodying the greatest deterrence value, enjoy a legitimate
existence (e.g., Quinlan, 2009; Riihle, 2009; Tertrais, 2011), though
the idea of conventional deterrence has also been pursued (Gerson, 2009;
Mearsheimer, 1985). Where the deterrence discourse prevails, certain
Arms Control measures fall in disregard. For example, de-alerting
(putting strategic nuclear forces on low alert) or even de-mating the
nuclear warheads from delivery vehicles, could be seen as destabilizing
deterrence against a first strike. Shifting to a no first-use doctrine
could be interpreted as opening one\'s nuclear forces for a first strike
conducted by non-nuclear means. Arms control in a deterrence discourse
could even advocate, under •certain circumstances, a build-up of nuclear
forces if numbers have diminished below a perceived minimum that is seen
as vulnerable to the combined offensive capabilities of potential
enemies. The Chinese aversion against transparency is also
stability-motivated, lest transparency could facilitate first-strike
targeting against Bejing s comparably small arsenal. Arms control is a
servant of deterrence and is limited by the perceived requirements of
the latter. The defense discourse means the capability to react once
deterrence fails and a ruthless enemy pursues conquest or extermination.
Arms control, in this discourse, must recognize the need and serve the
maintenance of a robust defense posture, which nowadays must inevitably
include defense against missiles. At the conventional level, the CFE
(Conventional Armed Forces in Europe) Treaty came closest to the ideal
arms control agreement: By reducing, and establishing an exact balance
for, those five weapon systems needed for a large-scale,
territory-grabbing land attack, while not touching those weapons
indispensable for defense (like air defense or anti-tank systems), it
granted the two participating alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Treaty
Organization, a chance for successful conventional defense This formula,
however, is hardly applicable to the nuclear sector: deterrence can only
be upheld through the offensive capability to strike even after having
suffered an attack. Effective defenses could annihilate this capability
for the party forced to strike second. It is hardly possible, therefore,
to achieve conventional defense and nuclear deterrence on the basis of
the same discourse, but only by combining the two. The defense discourse
on Arms Control is structured in a way that Arms Control advocates must
always fight an uphill battle against the argument of military
utility/necessity. This burden of justification has hampered and
frustrated advocates of international humanitarian law in the context of
the Geneva Protocols and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons
(CCW) time and again (Mathur, 2012; see below). [The **[disarmament
discourse]{.mark}** has a **moral overtone** in that weapons are seen as
immoral and dangerous items that, whatever their military value, must be
dismantled. They [are **framed in**]{.mark} **discourses of
[stigmatization]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Shamai, 2015), [in which the
stigma is connected to their destructive power (WMD [as **threat to
\[human\]**]{.mark}]{.underline}man[**[kind]{.mark}**), cruelty that
causes unnecessary and lasting suffering (chemical weapons, incendiary
weapons), [and **indiscriminate**]{.mark} **effects on civilians**
(**[all WMD]{.mark}**, antipersonal **[mines]{.mark}**, cluster
munitions)]{.underline} (Borrie, 2009; Price, 1998,2007; Rosert,
2015,2016). [**[Stigma]{.mark}** is not confined to WMD, but [can be
**glued to other weapons**]{.mark} systems **[as well]{.mark}**; hence,
weapons singled out for disarmament discourses are not dependent on the
particular strategic value; to the contrary, part of the discourse
consists of contesting this value to disempower arguments of military
utility]{.underline}, which are usually deployed by opponents of the
prohibition. Proponents of disarmament are even busy denying the utility
of nuclear weapons for both warfare and deterrence (Harrington, 2009;
Wilson, 2007, 2008). [**Today, [disarmers rely]{.mark} strongly [on
humanitarian arguments]{.mark}**; the **disarmament and humanitarian
[discourses tend to amalgamate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
**humanitarian discourse**]{.underline}; finally, [asks for measures
that serve best the goal of **human security**: the **survival**,
well-being, and integrity of **individuals**]{.underline}, notably
civilians; consequently, the weapons that have the most devastating
effect and discriminate least between combatants and civilians are
subject to the demand for elimination, notwithstanding their ascribed
military value. It is noteworthy that today\'s humanitarian discourse,
manifested in a broad array of weapon types from antipersonal mines to
nuclear weapons, has evolved from the tradition of the legal discourse
on the humanitarian law of war that prevailed into the 1990s. There, the
basic formula was to weigh humanitarian concerns and military utility.
The humanitarian discourse was thus dominated by the defense and
deterrence discourses. [**[Today's]{.mark} humanitarian [Arms Control
discourse]{.mark}** gives priority to human concerns over military
utility and **[links humanitarianism with disarmament, not with
constraints on weapons use]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Given the weight of
military considerations in the attitudes and decision making of
nation-states, this does not eliminate completely the weighting of
military aspects. But, the burden of proof has shifted. In the old
humanitarian law discourse, humanitarians had to argue against
\"military utility.\" In the new discourse, opponents of prohibition
have to argue for indispensability and irreplaceability of the weapons
in question (Price, 1998, p. 632). [As a consequence, in the nuclear
weapons field, a majority of states is **[not satisfied]{.mark} anymore
[with small steps]{.mark} of arms reduction, transparency
measures**]{.underline}, and confidence building; [**[rather, they push
for]{.mark}** a fast **[elimination]{.mark}** of nuclear weapons,
preceded by the conclusion of a nuclear weapons ban]{.underline}
(Borrie, 2014; Kmentt, 2015). [**The reason for the conservatism of the
classical discourse** on humanitarian law is **not** so much the past
practices of the **legalistic discourse** of international humanitarian
law]{.underline} (Mathur, 2012) [as the result of the balance of
political power, with great powers prevailing that wanted their
utilitarian concerns]{.underline} (fighting and winning wars) [to weigh
heavily in the resulting treaties]{.underline}. [The new discourse, in
contrast, was created by a coalition of humanitarian and disarmament
NGOs, and smaller and middle powers that push their causes because they
have more moral concerns than stakes in fighting and winning wars, or in
the weapons needed for war or for deterrence]{.underline} (Borrie,
2014). The intrinsic nature of the discourses has not engendered the
change, but shifts in coalitions and discursive power (Mathur, 2012).

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS THEORIES AND ARMS CONTROL [**Arms Control does
not completely discard self-help** as the basis of national security,
**but entrusts a** more or less **significant piece of it to cooperation
with potential enemies**]{.underline}.3 [**For this reason, Arms Control
is a difficult subject for** (purist) **realism**]{.underline} and
neorealism, [but also for **post-modernism**]{.underline}.
[Realism]{.underline} and neo-realism [expect states to pursue self-help
as the only reliable basis for their national security]{.underline}.
Cooperative security efforts admit that at least part of one\'s own
security is dependent on the partners\' compliance with agreed rules.
Arms Control also requires a more relaxed attitude toward the problem of
relative gains, the somehow unequal distribution of gains emerging from
cooperation (Grieco, 1990). Since it is extremely difficult to (define
exact balances (numerical balances, for example, neglect differences in
geopolitical situations, qualitative aspects, or intangibles like
differences in training, etc), relative gains are not only certain to
occur, but difficult to assess exactly. Even the notion of an exchange
of renunciation, in exchange for a security guarantee, is implausible in
the face of the security dilemma, as the guarantor might defeat or may
mutate into the enemy of tomorrow. **[That Arms Control happens in
reality is thus somehow puzzling]{.underline}**. **[For post-modernists,
Arms Control is only thinkable as a hegemonic project to maintain power
differentials, not as a non-hegemonic common endeavor that serves all
participants well]{.underline}**. [Both realists and post-modernists are
only at ease with unilateral, hegemonic Arms Control imposed on others,
notably on defeated states after war]{.underline} (for example, Iraq in
1991). [[For]{.mark} post-modernists, **[post-colonialists]{.mark}**,
and **critical security scholars**, **[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration
**[is]{.mark} the paradigm of hegemonic Arms Control as [an attempt to
prevent others from obtaining the weapons]{.mark} that [oneself
possesses]{.mark}**, and the conceding of the difference by middle
powers like Canada or Sweden is only explainable by the discursive
hegemony of the nuclear weapon states]{.underline} (Keeley, 1990).
[These critics are right to **[see roots]{.mark}** of non-proliferation
thinking [in]{.mark} the **[racist ideology]{.mark} of the colonial
era**]{.underline}, parts of which have been transported into the 20th
century and resonate still in the \"rogue state" discourse, with the
thrust that "civilized" states must keep "barbarians" at bay by
maintaining the difference in military power (Barkawi & Laffey, 2006;
**[Gusterson]{.underline}**, 1999; **[Mathur]{.underline}**, 2014).
[[This **critique**]{.mark}, however, [has **several
weaknesses**]{.mark}. It [**ignores** that **non-prolif**]{.mark}eration
**[was deployed]{.mark} first [with]{.mark} Germany and Japan**, then
already members of "**[the West]{.mark}**," [as the **primary
targets**]{.mark}]{.underline},4 [that the first victims of U.S. export
controls in the 1970s were advanced European states and Japan, **and**
that **controversies over the** peaceful uses of nuclear energy for the
first two decades of the]{.underline} nuclear NonProliferation Treaty
(**[NPT]{.underline}**) **[were between Western governments more than
between the West and the non-aligned]{.underline}** (Bccker et al.,
2013); [moreover, the]{.underline} Nuclear Suppliers Group
(**[NSG]{.underline}**) [as a main organ of Western nuclear export
controls includes today Brazil, China, Mexico, Kazakhstan, and South
Africa, **non-Westem members that are more than fig
leafs**]{.underline}. **[[It is the U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[that]{.mark} is pushing the
membership of India and has **[terminated "nuclear apartheid\"]{.mark}**
as far as India is concerned]{.underline}. Conversely, most European
states have not joined the "rogue state\" discourse, [and many
**[Western]{.mark}** Arms Control and **[non-prolif]{.mark}**eration
[**experts** have **never accepted the distinction between "reasonable\"
Northern**]{.mark} **nuclear weapon [states and "irrational"
Southerners]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[To the contrary]{.mark}**, they
have **[warned against]{.mark}** the [risks]{.mark} in South Asia
**[because of the proven risks of the]{.mark} nuclear arms race during
the [Cold War, where only a lot of luck saved
\[human\]]{.mark}**]{.underline}man**[[kind]{.mark} from a global
nuclear holocaust]{.underline}** (e.g., Gavin, 2010; Muller, 2013a).s
[It should [also]{.mark} be noted that multilateral **Arms Control
treaties apart from the NPT** have been **negotiated in a North-South
forum** such as the]{.underline} Biological and Chemical Weapons
Conventions (**[BWC/CWC]{.underline}**), [and that [recent]{.mark}
**conventional disarmament [treaties]{.mark}** [such as]{.mark} the
Ottawa Convention ([anti]{.mark}-personal **[mines]{.mark}**)
[and]{.mark} the Oslo Convention (**[cluster munitions]{.mark}**)
**[were]{.mark} initiated and [pushed by]{.mark} coalitions of Western
and [Southern middle powers against]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} express will
of **Northern and Southern great powers**]{.underline}
(**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[Russia, China, India]{.underline}). **[The [simple categorization of
West against South is no less ideological and misleading than the traces
of racist thinking in a limited part of the Arms Control
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[**In contrast, Arms Control presents
a solvable puzzle for rationalists** with]{.mark} their [emphasis
on]{.mark} absolute gains and their acceptance of positive sum games and
[the]{.mark}-information and **[transparency providing function of
institutions that manage]{.mark}** and administer Arms Control
**[agreements]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., the classic Axelrod &
Keohane, 1985). The exchange of renunciation and guarantee appears more
plausible to a rationalist when the guarantee is embedded in
institutions that render faithfulness more probable (like
institutionalized alliances), or in deployment patterns that make use of
armed forces in response to an attack more likely (e.g., tripwire-type
deployment). **[[Rationalist liberal institutionalism finds good
empirical confirmation in Arms Control]{.mark} regimes]{.underline}**.
[Indeed, **[most agreements]{.mark}** are endowed with organizations
that serve as channels for communication, arenas for sorting out
behavioral ambiguities of members and clarifying ambivalences in the
language of prescriptions and prohibitions, and [supply **transparency**
by **reporting and verification**]{.mark} and can, after all, take
decisions. [Not only **multilateral treaties**]{.mark}]{.underline} have
such organizations ([[like the]{.underline}]{.mark} International Atomic

**NPT**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or the]{.underline} Organisation for the

8.3 Dual-use Governance and Securitization Theory

[**Dual-use [governance]{.mark}** [has proved]{.mark} an
[interesting]{.mark} issue area [for]{.mark} the [**application** of
**securitization theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, this research has
drawn attention to the role of epistemic communities and scientific
consensus positions on given issues in the context of complexity and
uncertainty (Buzan, Wæver, and Wilde 1998, 72--73). In particular, this
work has emphasised the fundamental impacts of the emergence of these
factors on agenda setting and problem definition. Added to this, the
work has drawn attention to the idea that systemic risks are made
governable rhetorically with reference to complex webs of collaboration
between institutions in the development and implementation of risk
governance activities. This includes, for example, bio-preparedness
models of governance which have developed in the US and Europe. However,
the work also draws attention to the idea that such collaboration faces
a series of political challenges, particularly in the context of
anticipatory modes of governance which attempt to deal with challenges
beyond the scope of existing risk management structures.

Second, this work has outlined that [it is in this context that actors
(including state and nonstate institutions) engage in two key modes of
engagement with security politics. The first is the primary mode, which
involves **engagement** in activities designed to **set the rules** for
future **policy making processes** in relation given issue. This
includes, for example, deciding **which institutions** are in charge of
developing and implementing policies, and the **nature of collaboration
between actors within these processes**]{.underline}. Within this work,
it has been argued that the epistemic communities embodied in the NSABB
and Sloan report processes, for instance, have been central to such
processes.

[The other mode of engagement is secondary, which involves engagement in
the context of agreements about the overall process of policy
development. Within this mode of action, actors seek to impact directly
on the policies which are being developed and implemented. This may
include initiating, **advocating**, facilitating or **resisting**
**specific initiatives**]{.underline}.

Third, this work has outlined the extent to which [**policy models** are
useful to those who study processes of **securitization** in the context
of systemic risks]{.underline}. In chapter three, it was argued that
[these models could provide focus, structure and limits within analysis,
which are of central importance in interdisciplinary studies, as well as
in **multi-level approaches**, and that this could **help** the
**analyst to identify which activities, discourses and actors are and
are not relevant with regard to policy outcomes**]{.underline}.

It is certainly the case that these models performed these roles in two
important senses. First, they provided a central narrative for the life
and death of single initiatives and policy proposals. For example, [they
allowed for the exploration of the extent to which forwardlooking
oversight proposals have been rejected within political and policy
streams within the US]{.underline}. A case in point is recommendations
made by the NSABB in relation to synthetic biology research and
technology, which have often struggled to garner federal US support.
Another example was the 2004 bio-hazard non-proliferation proposal of
George Church, which was dropped in favour of other governance options
developed within the academic channel of polynucleotide synthesis policy
development.

It was also argued in chapter three, that [such **policy models** could
provide a straightforward **institutionally, historically and
politically situated 'environment' for discourses and 'speech-acts'** to
occupy within an overall process of **securitization**]{.underline}.
Such claims were made in the context of the concern that **[[analysts
studying securitization processes who rely on a linguistic
approach]{.mark} may [struggle to adequately account for the
socio-historical context of speech acts, and to sufficiently trace the
impact of such acts on policy outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Simply
put, it was argued that [some approaches focus much more on those
'speaking' security in relation to an issue, and much less on those
actually developing and implementing security policy. During the
**analysis process**, **[policy]{.mark} process models** provided a
**[framework]{.mark}** to [help]{.mark} understand **why actors were
speaking security in some contexts**, and **[what the actual
implications of this was for emerging policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
key example related to the NEST domain, where the scientific community,
as well as associated social scientists, have been identified as a first
line of defence in dealing with dual-use issues. [Placing these
assertions in a broader political context, however, **[revealed the
extent to which]{.mark} these [claims were contested]{.mark}**, as well
as **the extent to which such [assertions often belied low levels of
action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Further to this, reasons were given to
explain why NEST initiatives were struggling within both a US and UK
context to transform innovation practice, as well as to encourage key
regulators to engage pre-emptively with broader dual-use concerns.

#### [Our biotech reps]{.underline} are a [criticism of]{.underline} -- [NOT complicit]{.underline} with -- racist scientific epistemologies -- calling for [entangled responsibility]{.underline} [facilitates]{.underline} expanded political imagination

**Chandler 18** David Chandler, Professor of International Relations at
the University of Westminster, "Biopolitics 2.0: Reclaiming the power of
life in the Anthropocene," Contemporary Political Theory, 9-20-2018,
DOI: 10.1057/s41296-018-0265-9 /GoGreen!

Biopolitics was once the preserve of critical Foucauldian-influenced
theorists. This is no longer the case. The rise of new materialisms,
networked and object-oriented ontologies and demands for the
'renaturalization of politics' (Grosz, 2011; Sharp, 2011) have turned
the political into the biopolitical in much of radical contemporary
political theory. Here, the biopolitical is often in tension with the
Foucauldian discourses of the last few decades, affirming alternative
possibilities rather than merely critiquing regimes of power (Malabou,
2008; Kirby, 2011; Taussig, 2018). One factor in this shift has been the
impact of anthropogenic climate change and global warming on the
contemporary political imagination, increasingly refracted through
conceptualizations of the Anthropocene (Tsing, 2015; Cohen et al., 2016;
Chandler, 2018). A second factor has been that [the life sciences no
longer appear to support understandings of deterministic differences but
rather to cast evolution in sympoietic and entangled ways, making
biology appear as no longer essentialising but as increasingly
importable into politics, in ways which disrupt modernist or liberal
conceptions of the culture/nature divide]{.underline} (Haraway, 2016).
Two important but very different engagements, which reflect these
affirmative readings of biopolitics, are reviewed here, from the fields
of postcolonial literature and gender and race in international
politics. I'd like to start by laying out the insights and framing of
Stephanie Fishel's The Microbial State. This book is a well-worked
deployment of the new materialist thesis of the world of 'lively matter'
(the cover and publicity blurb feature a ringing endorsement from
leading political theorist Jane Bennett). Fishel locates her work firmly
in the camp of posthumanism, counterposing the modernist, 'anthropic'
account of the state as 'the body politic' to one that takes into
account the 'biospheric' and the 'microbial' (p. 2). The key conceptual
point is to highlight that the biological is crucial to the bounded
imaginary of the state as a community analogous to the human body. Both
these conceptions of the bounded political subject -- the individual in
liberal political theory and the state in international theory -- are
products of the biopolitical blurring of culture and nature in atomising
and essentialising ways. Fishel critically uses the life sciences as a
lens for alternative political imaginaries of complex and overlapping
communities, which seek to overcome the homogenising 'body' metaphors of
contemporary political discourse and the 'autonomous and autarkic'
subjects of the biopolitical they produce (p. 15). [Thus we move well
beyond]{.underline} Foucault's Biopolitics 1.0, [where biopolitics is a
technology of management and control. Instead]{.underline}, Fishel
provides [[a '**reversal of biopolitical
critique**]{.underline}]{.mark}, one that [**[emphasizes]{.mark}
vitality connection and [entangled
responsibility]{.mark}**']{.underline} (p. 21): 'This book takes life as
a creative intensity that can offer new solutions, and new ways of
engaging with the world' (p. 21). [In the inversion or 'reversal' of
biopolitical critique, the world and its entangled relationality
**becomes [a]{.mark} potential [cure]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the
dangerous [**'immunitarian'** and **essentialising biopolitical logic of
individual and state**]{.mark} **rights and
[interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} (p. 27). [The **metaphors of
entanglement**, contamination, sympoeisis and intra-active becomings can
**[facilitate]{.mark} and enable [a new]{.mark} (multi-species)
[politics, capable of addressing]{.mark}** the crises of global warming
and species **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Anthropocene.
Perhaps the most important conceptual move, in a range of interesting
treatments, is the importance attached to the 'microbial' of the book
title. [Modernist, or human-centred, views of development and security
**treat the human or the state as separate** and distinct entities and
therefore as the referent for politics, through metaphors of conflict
and militarism -- with treatment as 'intervention']{.underline}, germs
as 'enemies' or the 'war' against cancer (p. 49). Microbial and other
[entangled or relational metaphors **enable alternative ontologies of
being and becoming**]{.underline}. If we seriously want to tackle
contemporary problems, perhaps the starting point should instead be to
ask, 'What would a microbe do?' (p. 56) Microscopic bacteria may seem
'small and simple' but they are what enable life to exist and highlight
that living organisms are enmeshed in their environments, inside and
out, enabling us 'to envision political community as an assemblage of
multispecies groupings' (p. 56). Microbes [enable us to go beyond
binaries of self and other and to bring 'system-based understandings of
complex processes' to the political realm, enabling 'different forms of
practice for sustainable, ethical, global living with one another, and
with other life forms, as a bodies politic']{.underline} (p. 61).
[Processual and entangled ways of understanding politics change our
attitude to problems and their governance; the questions become 'more
about various ecological relationships and balance, rather than
resistance to invasion']{.underline} (p. 63). [Key]{.underline} to
microbial political possibilities [is the removal of the keystone of
modernist politics -- the individual as subject -- which 'places the
separateness of the human being as its most important
trait']{.underline} (p. 69). '[**[Biologically]{.mark}**, at least,
**[we are not]{.mark} intrinsically [individuals, but collective
super-organisms]{.mark}**, assimilating multiple species and millions of
individual organisms']{.underline} (p. 68). [Microbial worlds **[enable
us to question liberal and rationalist approaches]{.mark}** that
prioritise the individual over all other entities and collectives (this
**chimes well with other**]{.underline} feminist science
studies-informed **[work, equally suspicious of a liberal rights
framework]{.underline}**, for example, Clarke and Haraway, 2018).
Microbially-imagined or posthuman forms of governance enable creative
awareness that '\[I\]n Kantian and humanist terms, an individual is
always an end, not a means; therefore, the will of the individual cannot
be sacrificed without consent' (p. 69). Thus in Fishel's reworking of
the biopolitical, key targets are liberal conceptions of 'freedom' (p.
69), ['sovereignty, law and democracy']{.underline}, which [will need to
be redefined]{.underline}. [Microbes enable us to see the artifice
behind the distinctions of liberal political theory, of separate
entities with distinct rights and interests: 'From this perspective it
is impossible not to see the similarities between relationships in the
internal relations between members of microbiotic communities in the
human gut and the relations between member of a political
society']{.underline} (p. 75). [Rather than conflictual
self-interests]{.underline} -- the stuff of human-centred political
communities -- microbes [**enable us [to imagine a politics of
collaboration]{.mark}**: 'the human gut, in this book... is exemplified
as a community in which very few relationships are
pathogenic']{.underline} (p. 87). [The microbial message of
multi-species becoming is clear, with '**new definitions of health for
the state based on expanded notions of health through
plurality**]{.underline}... plurality and stimulation, not autonomy and
purity, lead to strength' (p. 90). Fishel is [well aware that what I am
calling 'Biopolitics 2.0' -- with its affirmative use of biological
metaphors -- runs the risk, associated with all imports from biology
into the political, of carrying 'illiberal and conservative
connotations', but]{.underline} she stresses that ['modern biology and
current biological thinking' are different, 'no longer based on static
equilibrium or a bare struggle for survival expounded by neo-Darwinist
theories of evolution']{.underline} (p. 101). [Rather than fixed
entities fighting for distinct interests, microbial imaginaries are ones
of collective and sympoietic becoming. This is a process of constant
change and transformation, of 'posthuman becoming' and 'biocultural
hope'; entanglements with others make all of us 'co-evolved
symbionts']{.underline} (p. 102) [where 'the world is a joint product
between the human and the non-human... composing the world
together']{.underline} (p. 105). Fishel's thesis of ['the reversal of
biopolitics' claims to '**[open a space to reformulate
biopolitics]{.mark} more positively [by affirming life as vital and
relational rather than a]{.mark} purely [mechanical reaction against
that which is Other']{.mark}**]{.underline} (p. 108). Fishel is keen to
flag up that in 'mining the hermeneutic potential of the life sciences'
(p. 113) she is **[[not forwarding 'science as a Western imperial
project']{.underline}]{.mark}** (p. 116) -- [but seeking rather 'to
redesign, traverse, and complicate the body politic' through using
'alternate visions of science' to 'demonstrate that hybridity and
heterogeneity are necessary elements for understanding the nature of the
individual and the individual's connection to the larger
world']{.underline} (p. 116). [The contemporary biological turn -- with
its rejection of Darwinist conceptions of 'survival of the fittest' and
imaginaries of the 'tree of life' with separate and distinct lines of
evolution -- here provides **[a powerful critique of liberal imaginaries
of security]{.mark} and development, [with]{.mark} the underlying
deterministic [telos of hierarchy, competition and
progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The ideas of the contemporary life
sciences]{.underline} -- which are rewriting nature as creative and
interactive rather than as passive and determined and emphasise
hybridity, transference across species boundaries, symbiosis and
sympoietic becoming -- would [seem [a **vital source of inspiration for
alternative political imaginaries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second
book under review, Deepika Bahri's Postcolonial Biology, engages the
biopolitical moment from the angle of rereading and deconstructing
embodied themes of transformation, hybridity and transference across
racialized boundaries in postcolonial literature. It is productive to
read her book alongside Fishel's as Bahri both complicates and
reinforces the points made above regarding the political and conceptual
productivity of biologically-informed political imaginaries. Bahri
states from the outset that her book 'claims biology as a valid --
indeed a crucial -- area of interest for critical postcolonial studies'
as ['\[T\]he socio-political challenges of the twenty-first century
require us to **look beyond biologically deterministic conceptions of
racialized difference** to porous, pliable, and **plastic bodies and
psyches as critically embattled zones of conflict in the wake of
imperial modernity'**]{.underline} (p. viii). Bahri's point is that [the
blurring of the nature/culture divide and the view of life as hybrid,
processual, disruptive and transformative -- rather than differentiated,
deterministic and static -- is **not simply the preserve of contemporary
posthumanist theorists** but was **already present in colonial
discourses of governance** with the 'implicitly reincarnative politics
of the so-called civilizing mission in imperial modernity']{.underline}
(p. 2). [**[Whilst it is easy to cast modernity as hegemonised by
a]{.mark} Darwinian ['racist science' which 'assumed]{.mark} that
[genetics locked in differences]{.mark} between races', the colonial
gaze, in fact, 'implied** an as-yet scientifically unverified but
implicit **[belief in human bioplasticity]{.mark} and aesthetic
reformation'**]{.underline} (p. 3). [Ideas of distinct bounded
bio-social political communities -- or bodies politic -- 'were
complicated by imperial designs on impressionable, plastic body-minds at
the level of ideology as well as the micromanagement of the subject's
bio-physiology']{.underline} (p. 3). For Bahri, [today's new materialist
or posthuman ontologies of human and non-human entanglement of nature
and culture can be read as **[already implicit in, and]{.mark} also** as
**[a response to, colonial discourses]{.mark}** of civilizing
mission]{.underline} (p. 3). Bahri highlights that Darwinian
perspectives, with their implied lines of genetic determination, were
not as dominant in the early twentieth century social sciences as
socio-biological discourses of indeterminism, with Lamarckian views of
acquired characteristics the bridge between culture and race (p. 152 n.
25). [Colonial and postcolonial views of the bio-social thus become an
'instructive precursor to the nexus of capital, corporation, and the
biopolitics of hybridity in the global present']{.underline} (p. 5).
**[While old biological determinism produced 'bad science and even worse
politics']{.underline}** (p. 6), [the **construction of the body as
'pliant, bio-mentally plastic and permeable'**]{.underline}, for Bahri,
**['is a battlefield no less worthy of our urgent
attention']{.underline}** (p. 6). [Thus the contemporary revisiting of
**the biopolitical** -- Biopolitics 2.0 -- is perhaps **more usefully
understood as a struggle**]{.underline} waged on the grounds of a
Lamarckian creationism, [where **[bottom-up 'bio-cultural hope']{.mark}
stands as [a]{.mark}n open and creative [counter to top-down views of
the manipulation of hybrid becomings]{.mark}, central to the colonial
mission**]{.underline}. Bahri examines how colonial discourses operated
not on a strict separation between biology and culture, but rather on
the construction of a sliding scale interconnecting nature and culture,
which imbricated both the life sciences and the humanities, constructing
them as distinct and yet flexibly co-constitutive disciplines. It was
this continuum that enabled ideas of racial distinction and genetic
determination to easily morph back and forth with ideas of social,
cultural and environmental hybridity and transformation. The colonial
civilizing mission inevitably overlaid views of fixed genetic
distinctions and determinations with bio-social discourses of epigenetic
transformation, which blurred the distinction between culture and
nature, enabling colonial hierarchies to be constructed and played out
through transformative imaginaries that biologized cultural attributes.
Bahri draws out well how these colonial discourses exposed the 'weak
link' of modernist or Enlightenment thought, in politicizing the
biological as the keystone of Otherness. In the bio-social construction
of the Other as inferior there is the implication that the outside is
always already present on the inside, as more real or 'authentic'. Thus,
[in]{.underline} her [citing]{.underline} of [Fanon]{.underline}, [for
the colonial mind, it is always the Other who is the 'bringer of
biology' or the one who 'symbolizes the biological']{.underline} (p.
29). Bahri's book engages with three novels, all of which deal with
postcolonial framings of hybrid becoming: Salman Rushdie's Midnight's
Children; Hari Kunzru's The Impressionist; and Julian Barnes' Unofficial
Englishmen, Arthur and George. The key characters in these novels all
aspire to becoming other, confronting postcolonial biology through
discourses of culture and aesthetics with the body as the site or
battleground of bio-cultural adaptive transformation. It is the
'biological body, its sounds, odours, excretions, urges, emissions, and
expressions' upon which the 'civilizational project' is expressed and
measured (p. 11). Culture and nature are conflated at the same time as
they are constructed as two poles of the human and the non-human. [The
key point being made is that **[the politics of race is an epiphenomenon
of]{.mark} a deeper and more essential aspect of modernist and
Enlightenment thought, the [distinction between 'culture' and 'nature',
which overcodes racial and colonial discourses]{.mark} of
'civilization'** and today's 'developmental aesthetics']{.underline} (p.
135). Bahri's work is also useful to understand today's import of the
contemporary life sciences into radical political imaginaries, as she
seeks to draw from the critical theorists of the Frankfurt School, who
maintained the colonial 'sliding scale' but used this to critique the
empty and 'hollowed subject' of the bourgeois rationalist Enlightenment
(p. 31). The continuum and interplay between the biological and the
socio-cultural-political was maintained, but [the radical goal was to
return to an awareness of the interdependencies, interconnections and
entanglements of the 'biological'. While the colonial civilizing mission
sought to develop a bio-social science of transformation and hybridity
to enable 'becoming modern' or 'becoming liberal', the radical response
was to flag up the artifice and hubris of modernity's attempt to repress
or erase our entangled biological being. Thus for Biopolitics 2.0, with
a more affirmative framing of nature and the biological, the weak link
-- exposed by the colonial discourse of 'civilizing mission' and
blurring of the biological and cultural -- can be turned against the
advocates of the modernist episteme. Having understood the inherently
oppressive logic of 'instrumental rationality' and the human/non-human,
nature/culture hierarchical divides, the way is then clear for the
return of biology as an alternative way of conceiving 'life' without
modernist/colonial binaries and bifurcations]{.underline} (p. 142).
[Thus **[it is possible for]{.mark} the [colonial discourses of
plasticity]{.mark} with their 'vague sociobiological
indeterminism'**]{.underline} (p. 152 n. 25) **[[to become repurposed
for imagining]{.mark} creative and open [alternative
futures]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The underlying stakes in
biologically-inflected discourses of transformative and hybrid becoming
were inevitably imbricated within universalist and modernist paradigms
of development and progress. This is still the case today, except that
the idea of the 'sliding scale' of civilization is transposed. In the
Anthropocene, ideas of the superiority of the 'human' over the
'nonhuman' or of 'culture' over 'nature' or of 'civilized' over
'indigenous' have lost their credence. It is little surprise that the
crisis of modernity has enabled the inversion of hegemonic, modernising
and colonial frames of transformation. This fundamental shift, nurturing
a new and affirmative assessment of the life that was previously
repressed or excluded]{.underline} is well reflected in the two books
reviewed here. [[Whereas]{.mark} Foucauldian-informed **[biopolitical
critique railed against]{.mark} the [reduction of the human to 'bare
life']{.mark}**, or of political life to biological existence,
**Biopolitics 2.0 [inverses the assumptions, seeking to reinvest 'mere
life' with]{.mark} meaningfulness and [value]{.mark}**: even life in its
smallest and simplest microbial forms can make the human look
insignificant and **[facilitate more creative political
imaginaries]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[The Threat of Biological Weapons: A Justification of Biological Weapons
Securitization]{.underline} 1. Introduction [In 2001]{.underline}, when
[attacks were carried out in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [involving]{.underline} Bacillus anthracis, the
bacterial agent that causes [anthrax]{.underline}, the threat of
biological weapons came into sharper focus for the American government.
[These attacks were not the beginning of the biological weapons threat,
but rather a point along a continuum of increasing risk]{.underline}.
Article 1 of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention defines biological
weapons to include the "microbial or other biological agents, or toxins,
whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in
quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective, or
other peaceful purposes" as well as the "weapons, equipment, or means of
delivery designed to use such agents or toxins for hostile purposes or
in armed conflict"1. The [use of biological weapons dates back
centuries, but the fear of biological weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}, here defined as weapons [that pose an
existential threat]{.underline} to the target, [is relatively
recent]{.underline}2. Much of it is attributable to the rapid advances
made in the biological sciences over the past decade, particularly with
respect to the field of genomics, where there is a growing ability to
manipulate genes3. This knowledge has a variety of applications in the
field of bioweapons. Additionally, while states use of biological
weapons was a concern through much of the 20th century, the possibility
that rogue states or non-state groups would use biological weapons was
largely ignored until the start of the 21st century1. Therefore, [the
threat of biological weapons has been framed as a security
issue]{.underline}4. This essay examines whether, and to what degree,
the threat of a biological weapons attack has been overstated with
respect to the government's response by drawing on securitization
theory, which critically evaluates the process through which an issue
comes to be viewed through a security framework. In addition, the essay
will also use the precautionary principle, described by the 1998
Wingspread Statement as the notion that "when an activity raises threats
of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures
should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not
fully established scientifically"5. Though more often applied to
considerations of environmental risk, in the case of biological weapons,
the principle could be used to justify caution even in the absence of
consensus surrounding the probability of an attack, simply due to the
severity of the consequences if an attack was to occur. It will be
argued that [the biological weapons threat has not been overestimated
and that the biodefense measures expressed in current policy and funding
decisions are warranted]{.underline}. Despite measures such as
likelihood-adjusted mortality, which may suggest the U.S. government
response is an overreaction, other characteristics of [the bioweapons
threat justify its securitization and resulting prioritization in the
government agenda]{.underline}. To do this, the essay provides a
discussion of how [the potential consequences of an attack pose an
existential threat]{.underline} to the United States, how [there is an
inadequate degree of preparedness]{.underline} for such an event, how
[the mere possibility of an attack is enough to warrant high spending on
preventive and preparative programs, and]{.underline} how [the response
has been appropriately measured given the threat]{.underline}. The focus
will be on the United States government because it has taken such a
prominent role in bioweapon securitization and biodefense funding. A
single country, the US, was chosen as a point of focus to avoid
confusion due to differing levels of threat and response across
countries. Additionally, any exaggerations that may exist in how the
media or the public portray and view the biological weapons threat will
be ignored; though this could be related to the government's decision to
securitize bioweapons, this is a separate issue from government policy
decisions in response to the security threat and is outside the scope of
this paper. 2. Securitization Theory and Biological Weapons
Securitization theory is a constructivist approach informing how certain
issues become framed through a security lens6. It offers a useful
analytical framework for understanding how, why, and what issues come to
be viewed as security threats. Securitization is an active process
wherein a securitizing actor, in this case the American government,
presents and addresses an issue as an existential threat to a particular
group, or referent object7. In these situations, emergency response
measures and extensive resource commitments are considered justified7.
Securitization theory generally promotes desecuritization as preferable
because it avoids the negative consequences of securitization, including
a heavy-handed state response, reduced democratic accountability, and
the narrowing of public choice8. However, it also recognizes that
securitization is sometimes appropriate. [Recent considerations of
securitization theory identify three criteria that, if fulfilled,
justify securitization: an objective, existential threat, a referent
object whose protection promotes human well-being, and a response
appropriately measured to the particular threat]{.underline}6. [In the
case of bioweapons securitization]{.underline}, the second criterion is
less controversial, given that the referent object is human population;
thus, any harm to the referent object would directly reduce a human
well-being. However, the question of whether securitization of
biological weapons meets the other two criteria is more contentious.
[Skeptics may point to Colin Powell's 2003 address to the
U]{.underline}nited [N]{.underline}ations [as a case where the
biological weapons security threat may have been exaggerated and
securitization was promoted for political ends]{.underline}, thereby
calling into question the legitimacy of the securitizing actor, the U.S.
government. In his speech, [Powell made the case for an invasion of Iraq
by claiming Iraq had capabilities to produce biological weapons of mass
destruction, including mobile bioweapons labs, a claim that later turned
out to be false]{.underline}9. [Critics also target the policies
resulting from securitization, arguing that the capacity of aggressors
to carry out large scale attacks causing mortality has been
overestimated, calling into question whether an existential threat truly
exists and whether the response has been appropriately
measured]{.underline}10. Government funding may be seen as unjustifiably
skewed in favour of biodefense, defined as the capacity to respond to a
biological weapons attack, to the neglect of other key areas, such as
endemic and pandemic diseases. For instance, Klotz calculated what is
referred as the "likelihood-adjusted mortality" for biological weapons,
pandemic diseases, and endemic diseases by multiplying the probability
of occurrence by an estimate of mortality were an event to occur11. By
comparing these values with government funding allocated to each
category, he demonstrated that biodefense receives more funding than its
likelihood-adjusted mortality estimate would suggest is warranted11.
However, objections have been raised to this argument. Supporters of
biodefense prioritization point to the fact that focusing solely on
potential fatalities ignores other issues, such as the negative social
and economic fallout from an attack12. Additionally, they point to the
possibility that it is more expensive to combat intentional threats,
where there will be an explicit effort to circumvent current practices
by exploiting weaknesses12. It should also be considered that the
probability of one attack is not independent from another, and that an
increasing probability of success may elicit more attempts12. To follow
will be an examination of whether government spending and policies
constitute a justified response to the threat of biological weapons.
Securitization is relevant in that it was a way for decision-makers to
implement the policies they want and is justifiable to the extent that
the programs themselves are necessary and appropriate.
[**[Despite]{.mark} other [consequences]{.mark} of securitization, [such
as public fear]{.mark}, [political manipulation]{.mark}, [and a
heavy-handed response]{.mark}**, which may give the impression of an
overreaction, [the reality is that **securitization** was]{.mark} a
means of enabling the implementation of certain policies and programs
**[necessary to respond to the threat of bio]{.mark}logical
[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 3. Consequences of an Attack [A
government's decision to securitize an issue is a strategy to make
extreme responses seem justified, and it centers on the perceived
existential risk]{.underline} a threat poses to the population7.
Beginning with a brief history of biological weapons use, this section
will aim to [defend the **framing of biological weapons use as an
existential threat** by examining their ability to cause mortality or to
generate negative social and economic fallout]{.underline}. A brief
discussion of the potential catastrophic consequences of a smallpox
attack will illustrate the argument. The use of biological weapons dates
back centuries. Examples include the Tatars catapulting plague-infected
corpses over city walls at the siege of Kaffa in the 14th century, the
deliberate triggering of a smallpox epidemic among Native Americans via
contaminated blankets in the 18th century during the French and Indian
War, and the contamination of salad bars with salmonella at a restaurant
in Oregon in the 20th century2. However, with the development of the
germ theory during the 19th and into the 20th century, there was an
increase in scientific knowledge about biological weapons10. States
became increasingly interested in such weapons, with Japan establishing
a bioweapons program between 1932-1945, the United States in 1942, and
the Soviet Union in 197313. In 1972, in response to increasing concern
about the threat of biological weapons, the United Nations proposed the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and
Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on
their Destruction, more commonly known as the Biological Weapons
Convention (or BWC)14. The treaty came into effect in 1975, and banned
the development, acquisition, and stockpiling of biological weapons1.
However, it failed to halt the research and development of biological
weapons, which have continued into the 21st century. Those who argue
that government response to the biological weapons threat has been
overstated point to very low mortality in previous attacks11. The
anthrax attacks of 2001 in the United States, for example, resulted in
only 5 deaths15. This argument could be used to urge governments to
instead invest resources in areas that consistently cause higher
mortality, such as infectious diseases like AIDS or even the seasonal
flu. However, in carrying out a threat assessment, it is also important
to look at the potential for mortality. Here it has been suggested
future attacks may not be on the same relatively small scale as those in
the past15. It is difficult to produce reliable estimates of fatalities
that might result from an attack; there is huge variation in estimates
and, often, little statistical evidence to support the predictions11.
That said, it is agreed that, in theory, even small amounts of a
dangerous biological agent could cause significant mortality if prepared
and disseminated effectively16. For instance, the WHO estimates that
50kg of B. anthracis distributed upwind of a population of 500 000 would
leave 95 000 people dead and 125 000 more incapacitated17. Other sources
suggest that 100kg of B. anthracis, disseminated via a crop-sprayer,
could kill as many as three million people, and comparable values have
been projected for other agents2,18. Another concern is that a
contagious biological agent will result in person-to-person
transmission, creating a self-sustaining effect not present in any other
weapons class10. While mass casualties are possible, it is also
important to note that, even in situations with few casualties,
biological weapons attacks may have profound social and economic
ramifications3. Such attacks could lead to widespread social panic and
disorder, resulting in self-destructive behaviour and creating what is
called a "societal autoimmune effect" involving increases in crime and
looting19. While there is little evidence to predict this would occur
based on previous disaster situations (such as the terrorist attacks on
the World Trade Center in 1993 and 2001, where the public reaction is
described as effective and adaptive, rather than panicked and
disruptive), it must remain a consideration20. The effects of a
largescale attack involving biological weapons are unknown, and
epidemics of highly fatal diseases may cause serious social
disruption20. The economic consequences of biological weapons attacks
are severe and suggest that investing in defense makes good economic
sense. While there were only five deaths in the 2001 anthrax attacks,
those attacks resulted in tens of billions of dollars in government
spending21. Also, the financial sector may be negatively impacted if
investor confidence plummets3. Similarly, an attack on the agricultural
sector, which accounts for 15% of the United States GDP, could have
severe economic ramifications3. If the biological agent being used is
contagious, there could also be implications for trade and travel
restrictions3. The SARS epidemic of 2003 showed the economic
consequences of a highly infectious disease, essentially "crippling"
some of the most dynamic cities in the world4. The Center for
Biosecurity has estimated the economic cost of a biological weapons
attack in the U.S. could exceed one trillion USD15. In short, there are
social and economic consequences that, considered in conjunction with
the potential for catastrophically high mortality, justify the framing
of biological weapons as a significant existential threat to the United
States. This is illustrated by considering the specific case of
smallpox. The Variola virus, which causes smallpox, is an example of an
agent that, if weaponized and used in an attack, would pose a serious
existential threat to the United States22. It is highly contagious; in a
1972 outbreak in Yugoslavia, even with routine vaccinations, which are
no longer carried out, the disease spread rapidly, with each affected
individual infecting 11 to 13 others23. It is also lethal, with a 30%
fatality rate1. Human populations are highly susceptible because, since
eradication, vaccinations have not been given for 20 years24. Other
features make smallpox an appealing option for bioterrorism: it has no
treatment once symptoms occur; it would not be detected for 7-17 days;
it is physically disfiguring; and the virus is stable in aerosol
form1,24. Perhaps the most problematic aspect of smallpox is that those
infected are contagious before symptoms appear. Simulations have been
carried out, including a 1999 exercise by the Center for Civilian
Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University, where a terrorist
release of Variola virus grew into a global outbreak, which the health
and emergency response system was unable to control22. Here it could be
suggested that prevention efforts promoted by securitization are the
only option, given the apparent inability to contain a global outbreak
after an attack has occurred. While the dangers posed by the Variola
virus are not contested, skeptics argue that it is too difficult to
acquire to be a real danger10. However, there is significant concern
over unaccounted Soviet Union smallpox samples, and a 1999 U.S. report
pointed to evidence that secret stockpiles of the virus are held by
North Korea, Russia, and Iraq1,25. It has also been suggested that the
terrorist organization Aum Shinrikyo holds quantities of the Variola
virus22. Threat and risk assessments should not rely solely on the
worst-case scenarios of biological weapons attacks, especially since
practical challenges still limit terrorists' ability to conduct attacks
that will have the greatest possible effect. However, it is equally
crucial to be aware of the wide range of consequences of such an attack.
This section has argued that [there could be serious ramifications on
several dimensions, ramifications which **[justify]{.mark} the
[framing]{.mark} of [bio]{.mark}logical [weapons as an existential
threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the United States [and warrant
investment in an appropriate response capacity. Securitization,
therefore, played an important role encouraging policy responses that
were justified and appropriate]{.underline}. 4. Preparedness for an
Attack This section will examine the capacity of the United States to
mitigate the consequences of an attack, a primary aim of biodefense.
[For government action to be justified, the **[response must be
appropriate]{.mark}** to the given threat level. The argument will be
that **[this is the case with biodefense programs]{.mark}**, which must
seek to address key weaknesses in the preparedness system]{.underline}.
[There is a general consensus that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has insufficient capabilities to respond
effectively to a biological weapons attack]{.underline}3. Three primary
components of preparedness will be addressed: the ability to detect an
attack, the preparedness of the health care and emergency response
system to respond, and the medical countermeasures that currently exist.
It will be shown that there are important deficiencies in all three of
these areas, further suggesting that [programs aimed at developing a
more appropriate **response capacity** are **not overestimating the
threat** but are both justified and necessary]{.underline}. Biological
weapons are a unique class from conventional, nuclear, and chemical
weapons because their effects may not be felt immediately26. It could
take days before it becomes apparent that an attack has taken place;
this is problematic as immediate treatment may be crucial to survival27.
Oral antibiotics for inhalational anthrax, for example, should be
administered within 48 hours of exposure, which leaves little time for
detection and delivery1. Any delay in detection could result in a large
number of casualties. Additionally, if the weapon agent is contagious,
failure to detect and respond the attack may result in a greater spread
of the infection. For this reason, adequate detection capabilities are
essential to bioterrorism preparedness. [Unfortunately, while funding
for biodefense **[has led to improvements]{.mark}**, such as
biosurveillance systems that seek information on disease outbreaks,
there are still weaknesses in the system]{.underline}15. The systems are
still quite rudimentary, relying on a time-consuming process of
clinician reporting, laboratory diagnostics, and the phoning, mailing,
or faxing of reports15. To improve, biosurveillance must be modernized.
We need more effective electronic reporting, quick, cheap, and reliable
diagnostic tests, and the integration of public health surveillance data
with that from other sectors such as law and intelligence agencies26.
Currently, however, detection systems are not able to detect biological
agents at relatively low concentrations, or to detect multiple
biological agents with a single system, and they are not sufficiently
portable and user-friendly26. Detection ability is further compromised
by poor diagnostic capabilities in hospitals. One U.S. study found that
91.2% of U.S. hospitals surveyed lacked the necessary diagnostic
technology to analyze and identify biological agents28. Hospitals have
been targeted as the weakest link in the preparedness chain, in
particular due to their inability to accommodate a sudden influx of mass
casualties29. It has been found that 60% of hospitals lack such
resources as the supplies, equipment, beds, and staff to respond to a
mass casualty situation28. Consequently, hospitals lack the surge
capacity to attend to patients; this could be disastrous in terms of
victims not receiving life-saving treatment, the failure to quarantine
infectious individuals, and the possibility of social disorder as a
result of public frustration. The problem is that hospitals need far
greater resources to respond to a bioterrorist attack than they do for
everyday functioning30. Practice scenarios have demonstrated this
resource shortage problem on more than one occasion. A simulated attack
on a U.S. city that involved the pneumonic plague resulted in antibiotic
shortages after just three days; the situation worsened until, at the
end of the weeklong simulation, 3700 cases of plague had been identified
and 2000 "deaths" had been reported31. Also of concern is the overall
inadequacy of medical countermeasures for biological weapons, identified
as one of the areas in greatest need of attention15. Of the twelve
biological agents identified as posing the highest threat to the United
States, only anthrax, smallpox, and botulism receive substantial funding
for medical countermeasure development and acquisition15. One reason for
this is that pharmaceutical companies are not as motivated to fund
research and development addressing biological weapons since there is
not as great a commercial market as there is for chronic diseases and
influenza15. Even such practices as decontamination require funding and
improvement. The decontamination procedures for B. anthracis, previously
used in the 2001 anthrax attacks, while effective, were also slow and
expensive, and could not be replicated in a situation with mass
casualties15. In the discussion above, it was argued that [high
government funding is not overestimated but is appropriate and justified
to implement biodefense initiatives **[required to improve response
capacity]{.mark}**. This was done by demonstrating that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is ill-equipped to deal with a
significant biological weapons attack, and that this lack of
preparedness risks further exacerbating the already potentially
catastrophic consequences of a biological weapons attack.
**[Securitization was useful in]{.mark} helping justify [prioritizing
funding]{.mark}** to address this issue]{.underline}. 5. Probability of
an Attack The potentially disastrous consequences of an attack and the
lack of preparedness for such an event have been demonstrated, but
perhaps none of that would matter (or justify prioritizing biodefense)
if the probability of an attack by states or terrorists was negligible,
due to an absence of capacity or will to carry out a biological weapons
attack on the United States. This section will consider the [likelihood
of a biological weapons **[attack]{.mark}** in the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[[by states or
terrorist groups]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This issue [is hotly contested,
with some groups arguing that the chances of an attack are much lower
than popular fears and perceptions would suggest, while others, like CIA
Director Gross, believe it is "only a matter of time", and predict
another biological weapons attack on the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [before 2020]{.underline}28,32. As noted earlier,
this essay's focus is not on whether media rhetoric is inflated or
public perceptions unrealistic. Rather, it will be argued that the
[**[increasing availability]{.mark}** of biological weapons [and]{.mark}
the **[documented intent of various hostile groups]{.mark}** to acquire
such weapons [make]{.mark} an attack **[more
likely]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is where we see the relevance of the
precautionary principle, as an uncertainty surrounding the probability
of an attack encourages us to adopt the principle, promoting caution
where funding is allocated in light of the dire consequences that may
arise were an attack to occur. Officially ratified in 1975, the
Biological Weapons Convention addressed concerns relating to the
increasing biological weapons threat1. While commendable, the convention
had important flaws including an absence of any formal verification of
compliance by states. For instance, after signing the declaration, the
Soviet Union continued to develop their biological weapons program
(unbeknownst to the global community)33. Soviet defectors later
confirmed the scale of their program, describing a massive, covert
operation34. Other countries have also been alleged to have biological
weapons programs, including Iraq, North Korea, Iran, Libya, and
Syria33,35. While Iraq has since claimed that its biological weapons
were all destroyed, this has been impossible to verify2. Additionally,
with the recent emergence of biotechnology industries in low and
middle-income countries, most notably Brazil and India, more states are
gaining advanced scientific capacity that could potentially be applied
to biological weapons development and production3. The key here is that
many states now have the scientific and technological capacity to
develop biological weapons, but there is a limited capacity for national
states or international organizations to monitor such a process36. In
the BWC definition of biological weapons, the primary focus is on
intent---both in terms of the purpose of the microbial agent and the
delivery system1. Intent is the determining factor in the classification
of biological weapons, but this is extremely difficult to measure or
prove until after an act has been committed. In the biological sciences,
much research is readily applicable to justifiable ends (vaccines), as
well as hostile ones (biological weapons). The United States will often
accuse other states of hostile intent based solely on the presence of
pharmaceutical and biotechnological expertise necessary for biological
weapons development35. This can be viewed as an area of overreaction to
the bioweapons threat, illustrating how securitization processes seem to
legitimize some bad policy responses as well as good ones. Despite the
fact that most states could use this expertise to develop biological
weapons, the majority does not. This suggests that, while capacity is
present, the intent to use biological weapons is limited. In fact, over
the past century, there is only one confirmed case of a biological
weapons attack by one state on another: Japan's striking against China
in the 1930s and 1940s1. It has been suggested that reasons for this may
stem from fear of retaliation or the difficulties of controlling effects
on civilians and combatants1. Most countries possessing biological
weapons claim their purpose is to deter attacks or biological weapons
use by others35. In the past, the prospect of terrorists using
biological weapons received little attention3. It was generally believed
that terrorists would not be able to engineer biological weapons because
they lacked access to the necessary biological agents, the technological
capabilities, and the specialized knowledge to weaponize and disseminate
a biological weapon10. Skeptics still believe that the advanced genetic
capabilities required to produce biological weapons will not be
available to terrorists in the near future3. For instance, the ability
to process a biological agent into aerosol form, the most effective
delivery method, requires expertise across a wide range of scientific
disciplines32. Also suspect is their ability to account for
environmental and meteorological conditions that may disrupt weapon
dissemination10, 32. However, a changing global and scientific landscape
has led to a greater potential for the acquisition of biological weapons
capacity by terrorist groups. For instance, during the Cold War, the
Soviets reportedly employed approximately 55, 000 scientists and
technicians at 6 biological weapons research labs and 5 production
facilities37. Among other things, smallpox was weaponized into ballistic
missiles and bombs38. In 1997, the United States conducted a visit to
one of these research labs to find that the facility was half empty,
poorly guarded, and that most of the scientists had left39. It is,
therefore, possible that the biological agents, the equipment, and the
human knowledge and expertise have since fallen into the hands of rogue
states or terrorist organizations. Additionally, methods of biological
weapons production are now freely accessible via the Internet, and the
technological requirements are not beyond the means of a determined,
well-funded terrorist organization2. Moreover, recent scientific
advances may support biological weapons production by enabling the
production of a higher yield of high-quality product36. They may also
support more effective weaponization, by making agents more resistant to
environmental hazards or by making agents targetable against specific
biochemical pathways36. As these capabilities spread across the globe,
there will be a greater potential for terrorists to harness and use
these techniques. While the capabilities of terrorists to engineer
biological weapons may have been overstated in the past, this can no
longer be said to be the case. It has been argued that two of the
preconditions for assessing the threat of bioterrorism, vulnerability to
an attack and terrorist capability, are in place; the only remaining
consideration is intent40. It is important to determine whether the
intent to acquire and use such weapons is present among terrorist
groups. While terrorist groups have not often used biological weapons,
it is unclear whether this is due to insufficient capabilities or lack
of intent1. There are a variety of reasons why they may not be
interested in the use of biological weapons, including viewing such
weapons as illegitimate in military combat, risks of tactical failure,
perceptions of high technical difficulty, and concerns about the
indiscriminate nature of a biological weapons attack3. That said,
various terrorist groups, including Aum Shinrikyo and al Qaeda, have a
documented interest in the acquisition of biological weapons, and with
advances in biotechnology and weaponization, their use may become more
attractive2, 41. Experts also point to a shift in terrorist intent:
"post-modern" terrorism aims to inflict the highest mortality rather
than make political statements through violence33. This makes biological
weapons an attractive option for such groups; one estimate suggests that
the cost to cause civilian casualties is only one dollar per square
kilometer for biological weapons, compared to 800 and 2000 dollars per
square kilometer for nuclear and conventional weapons, respectively42.
In a similar vein, the recent "war on terror" has created an
increasingly decentralized terrorist threat; biological weapons are
particularly well-suited to this form of smaller, more informed
terrorist groups28. In short, while the intent to use biological weapons
has been documented in terrorist groups in the past, present
circumstances may make the acquisition and use of biological weapons
more attractive. To conclude, it is difficult to either predict or
prevent a bioterrorism attack, which makes any assessment of attack
probability, by necessity, subject to a high degree of estimation.
However, due to the potential severity of consequences of an attack, the
precautionary principle justifies the government decision to allocate
spending according to the severity of consequences, recognizing a
situation where [it is **better to overestimate than to underestimate**
the probability of an attack]{.underline}. As argued by Michael Moodie
of the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute, "[The odds (of
bioterrorism) are increasing...we **have to [walk a fine line between
hyping the risk...and trying to convince people]{.mark} that it is a
possibility for which [we need to invest
resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}"2. 6. Biodefense Funding The essay's
previous sections have argued that a biological weapons attack would
pose an existential threat to the United States, that there is an
inadequate capacity to respond to such an event, and that the
possibility exists for such an attack to occur. This would suggest that
[a substantial amount of government funding should be allocated towards
addressing this threat. The decision to securitize bioweapons
facilitated this process]{.underline}. Critics who believe the threat
has been overstated often argue that the government should not invest so
heavily in biodefense, but instead, improve other sectors, such as
reducing mortality from endemic disease11. Meanwhile, proponents may
argue that a securitized issue should receive more funding than issues
that are not framed as an existential threat4. This section will argue
that [the response]{.underline}, in terms of government spending, [is
justified]{.underline} in that it seeks to protect the public [and has
**not exaggerated the threat of bioterrorism**]{.underline}. This will
be demonstrated by examining the degree of investment in biodefense,
showing that a relatively small amount is allocated specifically to
biodefense. In 2000, the United States federal budget proposed that 10
billion USD be allocated to counterterrorism programs, an increase of
3.3 billion dollars from the previous year10. This covered all forms of
terrorism, but there was a greater focus on biological terrorism than in
the past, with spending on medical countermeasures and defense measures
increasing fourfold from 91 million USD in 1998 to 336.6 million in
20002. These trends intensified after the 9/11 attacks and the
subsequent "Amerithrax" scare. While estimates vary, the consensus is
that, since 2001, the United States government has invested between 50
and 100 billion USD towards research and development in response to the
perceived threat of a biological weapons attack43. One calculation
posited that the U.S. allocated 54.39 billion USD to civilian biodefense
programs between 2001 and 201044. This did not include allocations to
Bioshield, a program designed to address the lack of adequate medical
countermeasures for terrorist attacks; 8.7 billion USD has been
allocated since 200445. However, of civilian biodefense funding, 42.57
of the 54.39 billion USD was directed towards programs with multiple
goals beyond biodefense improvement, such as basic infectious disease
research, programs to improve public health planning and operations, and
improving preparedness for a range of disasters44. One example is the
Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Hospital Preparedness
Program, which seeks to improve surge capacity in healthcare
facilities44. Some estimates suggest that up to 92% of biodefense
funding has been directed to programs that serve secondary purposes,
such as improving preparedness for disease pandemics and natural
disasters15. One could argue that [the amounts dedicated to biodefense
as a percentage of entire budgets are not very substantial given the
existential threat posed by an attack]{.underline}. The DHHS, the
largest recipient of federal biodefense funding, has a budget of 879
billion USD, of which biodefense made up only 0.5%44. Similarly,
biodefense makes up less than 1% of the Department of Homeland Security
budget, and only 0.10% of the Department of Defense Budget44.
Accordingly, it could be argued that the bioweapons threat does not, in
fact, take as high a priority in terms of government funding as one
might expect, given the associated security risk. Additionally, almost
all of the increases in investments have arisen from new funding; other
sectors are not suffering at the expense of biodefense prioritization12.
High funding is appropriate independent of any controversy relating to
estimates of attack probability, as the precautionary principle would
suggest that decisive action is warranted given the potential for dire
consequences, even with a low probability of the event occurring. These
figures show that [the funding response is not an overreaction but has
been justified and appropriate given the documented threat of biological
weapons, targeting programs that are likely to protect the
public]{.underline}. 7. Conclusion The anthrax attacks of 2001 are a
case where biological weapons were used against the United States in the
absence of any direct provocation. Since then, though the issue is
controversial, biological weapons have been considered an important
threat to U.S. security. This essay [has defended the
**[securitization]{.mark} of the bio**logical **weapons threat** as a
means to an end. It is a process to engage in where it is **[necessary
to get approval for policies that are]{.mark}**, in themselves,
**[necessary and justified]{.mark}**. By analyzing the existential
threat posed by bioweapons, the lack of preparedness by the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [for such an event, and the
possibility of an attack, evidence presented in this essay suggests that
these policies and the overall government **response were
appropriate**]{.underline}. Taking these issues into account, the essay
concluded that [the **threat of bioterrorism has not been
overestimated**; it **warrants securitization and the resulting
response** measures. Moving forward now, government must recognize and
respond to the reality of an increasing bioterrorism
threat]{.underline}.

### AT: L -- China

#### China threat discourse doesn't cause war -- BUT the ALT does

**Hagstrom 14** -- PhD, Swedish National Defence College, Department of
Security, Strategy and Leadership (Linus, "East Asia\'s Power Shift: The
Flaws and Hazards of the Debate and How to Avoid Them," Asian
Perspective, 38.3)

[Pan [argues]{.mark} that the [\"China threat discourse\"]{.mark} is
\"always intrin- sically linked to how US policymakers/mainstream China
special- ists see themselves (as representatives of the indispensable,
security-conscious nation]{.underline}, for example)\" (2004, 306).
Hagström demonstrates how the discourse on Japan\'s \"abnormality\" and
\"weakness\" reproduces a standard of \"normality\" in world politics
that is centered on the ability to go to war. Postwar Japan is socially
constructed as deviant from this norm and thus as a threat to itself.
This discourse, which emerges in both Japanese and Western academia and
in Japanese political debate, legitimizes a road map for a more
\"realistic,\" \"active,\" \"responsible,\" and \"nor- mal\" Japan
(Hagström 2014).∂ The power of the power-shift discourse does not stop
at the production of identities and standards. [The point is that
identities and standards [produce effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. Pan
illustrates this by showing how the Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1995-1996
was often understood as \"further objective proof of the long-suspected
\'China threat,\'\" but few acknowledged that \"the \'China threat\'
discourse itself had played a constitutive role in the lead-up to that
crisis\" (2004, 323, 320). Moreover, standards in Japan\'s
\"normalization\" discourse have enabled Realpolitik changes in its
foreign security policy. Chinese vigilance vis-à-vis Japan and the
United States might also be interpreted as discursive phenomena-the
theme of national reinvigoration is a product of the lingering notion
that China has been continually humiliated and victimized by the great
powers since the nineteenth century. As these examples illustrate, the
ulti- mate power of discourse is the production of self-fulfilling
prophecies. When self-fulfilling prophecies occur on both sides of a
dyad, we might end up with a socially generated security dilemma
(Johnston 2004).∂ [[Much research]{.mark} has [warned of self-fulfilling
prophecies]{.mark} in the East Asian context. Some observers suggest
that US]{.underline} or Japanese [discourses about China might produce
policies of containment]{.underline}, Japanese \"normalization\" and
\"remilitarization,\" and US \"rebal- ancing\" toward East Asia (Pan
2004; 2012; Hagström 2012; Turner 2014a; 2014b).
**[[Nonetheless]{.mark}, Japan and the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[have not]{.mark}]{.underline}** yet [**[embarked on containing
China]{.underline}**. [Instead, both]{.underline}]{.mark} [countries
have on the whole [accommodated China\'s rise]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Christensen 2006; Jerdén and Hagström 2012). In a similar manner,
perceived increases in bellicose or nationalistic representations in
Chinese discourses led some observers to jump to the mistaken conclusion
that this had already resulted in a more assertive Chinese foreign
policy (Jerdén 2014). As important as it is to remain vigilant against
the emergence of socially constructed security dilemmas, [we need to
bear in mind that [there is **no deterministic connection** between
discourse and policy]{.mark}-just an enabling one. Dominant
[discourses]{.mark}]{.underline} create propensities for action but
**[[do not make]{.mark} any [action inevitable]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
More empirically informed theorizing is needed to address the questions
of how, when, and why discourses make some actions politically
conceivable, easy to communicate, and sometimes even coercive (Holland
2013).∂ Reflecting on the possible power exercised through the alter-
native approaches introduced in this special issue is also neces- sary.
In this article we raise analytical and normative concerns about the
ideas of a more \"powerful\" and \"threatening\" China, a \"weak\"
Japan, and a \"declining\" United States. We argue that such
representations risk offsetting balancing policies and a secu- rity
dilemma in East Asia, in line with the self-fulfilling prophecy logic
discussed above. These arguments clearly belong to another site of
discursive power production. That we have not seen any obvious balancing
policies in East Asia thus far might arguably be interpreted as one of
its effects.∂ In fact, our critique of the power-shift debate might
itself be criticized as [[denying or playing down Chinese
power]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [[could have]{.mark} two
[effects]{.mark}]{.underline}: (1) [[China appears less]{.mark} powerful
and thus less [threatening, which allows it to]{.mark} arm itself with
impunity and [behave aggressively; and]{.mark}]{.underline} (2) [the
[Chinese]{.mark} government [can ignore calls to take on]{.mark} more
international [responsibilities]{.mark} with reference to the limited
scope of its power]{.underline}. As William Callahan points out,
attempts to counter the \"China threat theory\" within China often
\"refute \'Chinese\' threats as a way of facilitating the pro- duction
of an American threat, a Japan threat, an India threat, and so on\"
(2005, 711). Adopting a nonintentional power con- cept allows us to see
how even [[critical scholars]{.underline}]{.mark}, inside and out- side
China, [[who]{.underline}]{.mark} profess no interest in exaggerating
threats against China but rather \"[seek to [deconstruct the]{.mark}
discourse of \'[threat,\']{.mark}]{.underline}\" [might [play a
role]{.mark} in **[accelerating this process]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Callahan 2005, 711). In other words, [intentional [attempts to
prevent]{.mark} the emergence of [a self-fulfilling prophecy **may
actually play a**]{.mark}**n unintentional [part in creating
one]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### AT: L -- Cybersecurity

#### No impact to securitizing cyber threats

**Gomez 21** Miguel Alberto Gomez, Senior Researcher with the Center for
Security Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, PhD

Whyte, PhD, Assistant Professor in the program on Homeland Security &
Emergency Preparedness at Virginia Commonwealth University's L. Douglas

Cyber Doom: Securitization and Normalization of Novel Threats,"

According to some, advancements in technological and organizational
capabilities among capable state and stateaffiliated actors over the
past decade increase the likelihood that offensive cyber operations
(OCOs) might soon produce destructive physical effects (Saltzman 2013;
Healey 2016). Expectations of real-world damage inflicted through
cyberspace reinforce the "cyber doom" narrative that digital insecurity
might result in a massive failure of social and economic processes
across societies dependent on new information technologies and that
dread of such failure permeates public perspectives on cyber issues
(Hansen and Nissenbaum 2009).

For those who study public opinion surrounding foreign policymaking, the
"cyber doom" type of narrative is not especially uncommon. Environmental
circumstances of sufficient visibility and meaning, such as the
trauma-inducing experiences of 9/11 or the Cold War, often take on life
of their own and affect opinion formation independent of an individuals'
priors or the cues of elites. Oddly, however, [the oft-referenced notion
of "cyber doom" appears paradoxical, even despite the link some scholars
make between OCOs and physical effects]{.underline}.

Presently, conflict in cyberspace is characterized by
persistent-yet-limited effects and a condition of apparent restraint
exercised by cyber-capable actors (Maness and Valeriano 2016;
Fischerkeller and Harknett 2018a). Moreover, [the unabated integration
of vulnerable information systems across all aspects of modern societies
raises the question of whether or not a sense of dread associated with
the exploitation of cyberspace is as severe as commonly
portrayed]{.underline} (Jarvis, Macdonald, and Whiting 2017). Most
damningly, [**[the idea that "cyber doom" is most visible in
Western]{.mark} national [experiences as a fear appeal employed by
politicians to galvanize support for policy in no way explains]{.mark}**
these curious logical **[shortcomings]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[At the heart of the "cyber doom" narrative is the assumption that
information about **cyberattacks**]{.underline} released to the
public---[particularly information about sophisticated **cyber
operations** of **foreign countries** and **organized
crime**]{.underline}1--- [produces **anxiety**]{.underline} about the
digital health and security of a person. Ironically, this assumed
relationship between cyber operations, their portrayal in public-facing
media, and individual impact is often discussed in unclear terms by
scholars than is the determining role of techno-strategic conditions.

[Despite the recent turn by some to consider the societal impact of
OCOs]{.underline} (Lin and Kerr 2017; Lindsay 2020; Whyte 2020), most
research on cyber conflict continues to emphasize logic-of-the-domain
explanations for the behavior of cyber-capable actors.2 This makes a
certain sense because the domain is human-made and malleable. However,
it is also puzzling given the scope of cyberspace and the degree to
which digital action impacts both private industry and civil society
across numerous levels. Though the mechanisms of interaction may be less
precise than is the case with other forms of state power, [the
literature on public opinion, morale, and psychology in foreign
policymaking tells us that popular perceptions of threat are shaped by a
host of factors that then impact the formulation and implementation of
state security policy]{.underline}.

In this article, we take aim at the "cyber doom" narrative logic as an
initial step toward clarifying the relationship between cyber conflict,
its portrayal, and public thinking about digital insecurity.
Consequently, we align with **[[critics of the
narrative]{.underline}]{.mark}** itself but argue that such criticisms
[[make **overly simplistic assumptions** about public opinion
and]{.mark} national [security that do little to enrich]{.mark} and
undergird evolving cyber conflict [research]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
logic of the core argument about digital disaster aside,
[the]{.underline} broader "cyber doom" [argument]{.underline}--- i.e.,
[that the rhetorical and cognitive prospect of doom has some effect on a
population---is undertheorized and understudied]{.underline}. [This
point is **particularly important** because scholarship aimed at
explaining the sources of state public policy on cyberspace makes the
curious **misstep** of **holding domestic population preferences
constant** while **focusing on third image determinants of strategy**
development]{.underline}. [Authors argue that publics cyclically react
with some fear to emergent threats and that, therefore, public policy is
best explained by the incidence of cyber conflict or steps taken by
state peers]{.underline}. Given that [**such assumptions** are clearly
**far from safe** on the merits]{.underline}, this article aims to
ascertain whether or not negativity among the general public associated
with malicious behavior in cyberspace is as salient as broadly claimed.
We add evidence to the argument that the "cyber doom" narrative is
unrealistic (Lawson 2013) by showing that the assumptions found therein
are misleading.

Our [[**study** finds]{.mark} that **sensitivity to cybersecurity
threats** is situationally shaped by exposure to negative reporting but
that the onset of associated **dread** is **not a given**. Instead, it
is influenced by expectations of the role of technology in modern
society. Respondents dependent on such technologies are not as prone to
negative effect as are those who remain not so deeply embedded in the
fabric of digital society]{.underline}. Both groups become more
sensitive to cybersecurity threats to their person as the information
they consume becomes more negative, and this personal concern
facilitates a heightened sensitivity to threats to the polity. However,
[the **dread predicted** by the "cyber doom" narrative is **[only weakly
predictive]{.mark}** of this dynamic [and **has no effect** on]{.mark}
the **[threat sensitivity]{.mark}** of those who do not respond
emotionally]{.underline}. Finally, [in both cases, the link between
concern for society is **not a clear result of negative info**rmation so
much as it is the result of initial sensitivity to threats at the
personal level]{.underline}.

Consequently, we make two contributions. First, we show that [the impact
of novel environmental circumstances on individual opinion formation
**is shaped by issue embeddedness**, suggesting that **[long-term
exposure]{.mark}** to any invasive development **[mitigates the
affective response]{.mark}** it is associated with]{.underline}. Second,
we present evidence suggesting nevertheless that the unique
characteristics of such a development matter in opinion formation, as
sensitivity to digital threats to the polity is clearly premised on
personal threat sensitivity.

These findings suggest that not only "cyber doom" is strategically and
functionally unrealistic, but [the [**effects** of]{.mark} the idea's
[**securitization** are]{.mark} also [**minimal** and]{.mark} **prone to
[diminish]{.mark}ment [over time]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In doing so,
they **speak to the broad research program** on public opinion and
audience dynamics in **foreign policymaking**]{.underline}. More
specifically, in line with recent work (Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017), our
[study suggests that citizens are far more capable of responding to
threat stimuli absent elite cues]{.underline}. Significantly, [our work
joins **[research]{.mark}** that **[locates responsiveness]{.mark}** to
policy issues [in]{.mark} the interaction of **[cognitive
priors]{.mark}** and social context with incoming information about new
events. [**Judgment is rarely as linear** as]{.mark} the "cyber doom"
narrative [suggests **in**]{.mark} its **[linking]{.mark} of [negative
reporting]{.mark}, [fearful response]{.mark}, [and sensitivity to threat
inflation]{.mark}**. Instead, individuals are **conditioned by social
circumstances** such that **even novel threats are incorporated** into
the horizon of issues the public encounters]{.underline}.

[[For the last two decades]{.mark} a strategy employed by health
professionals, [scientists, and diplomats]{.mark} has been to **[play
the 'health security card']{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to
achieve]{.underline} [particular]{.underline}]{.mark} **[trade,
diplomatic, strategic, and development [goals]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Elbe 2011). The presumption has been that [the
**[securitisation]{.mark}** of health will [harness global]{.mark}
**political [leadership and resources]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [This
marriage of health issues to security logic has been met with a mix of
applause, caution, and critique]{.underline} (Feldbaumet al. 2010;
McInnes and Rushton 2013; Hanrieder and Kreuder-Sonnen 2014).
[But]{.underline} the presumption has remained that, **[for the most
part]{.underline}**, [the marriage of health issues to security
will]{.underline} '**[harness]{.underline}** political leadership and
**[resources]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} various [international
health issues']{.underline} (Elbe 2011: 220). In the last 15 years,
there have been three United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions
that have specifically referred to health matters -- S/Res/1308 (2000),
S/Res/1983 (2011), both concerning HIV/AIDs, and S/Res/2177 (2014) in
response to the Ebola viral disease outbreak in West Africa. In December
2012, the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) passed resolution
A/67/L.36, Global Health and Foreign Policy, the fifth resolution on
global health and foreign policy resolution to pass in the UNGA since
the adoption of the first resolution on Global Health and Foreign Policy
in 2008 (A/63/33). The UNGA also adopted resolution A/69/1 giving
support to the measures recommended by UN Secretary-General to contain
the Ebola outbreak (A/69/389 2014). The decision of the UNSC to adopt
three resolutions on health matters in 15 years and the UNGA sessions on
global health and foreign policy have received mixed views. Some point
to these events as illustration of the weakness of the global health
security narrative (Youde 2014). In particular, it has been noted that
the Ebola outbreak in 2014 was initially met with no international
capacity outside of the World Health Organization (WHO) to respond to
this crisis. The creation of the UN Mission on Ebola Emergency Response
(UNMEER) in September (2014) was the first, and some argue should be the
last, effort to respond to a viral outbreak (Panel of independent
experts 2015). Others contend that, given that there is no procedure
under the UN Charter for the General Assembly or Security Council to
examine health matters -- let alone develop a mission like UNMEER --
broader UN engagement in health beyond the WHO could point to the
success of the global health diplomacy (McInnes 2015). The question is
what does successful global health diplomacy look like? Do we see in
practice the securitisation of health as essential to pursue
international diplomatic engagement in global health? There have been
recent claims that the successful international engagement in health
initiatives such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB, and Malaria (Global
Fund) and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have been achieved without
asserting their necessity 'primarily on security considerations'
(McInnes and Rushton 2013: 16; see also Sridhar 2012; Gagnon and Labonte
2011). However, the assumption remains that linking health issues,
specifically health emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks to
security discourse will create more opportunities for diplomatic
cooperation and engagement (see Feldbaum et al. 2010; Hafner and
Shiffman 2013). This chapter explores this argument beginning with the
period where the phrase 'global health diplomacy' and 'global health
governance' began to gain usage in international relations in the 1990s.
In the first part of the chapter I briefly present the conceptual
history of health security and its relationship to 'global health
diplomacy'. I explore the argument that the success of global health
diplomacy has come from the preponderant use of security language,
referents, and discourse (cf. Elbe 2011; Feldbaum et al. 2010; Kickbusch
et al. 2007; McInnes and Rushton 2013). In the second part of the
chapter I examine two cases, one where a type of security logic was
deliberately employed to frame the 'health emergency' (Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control or FCTC) and one where human rights logic
was initially deployed when advocating for its creation (the Global
Alliance for Vaccine Immunization or GAVI). I evaluate what 'health
security' looks like in these global health initiatives and explore the
presumption that 'security discourse' must be present in comparing these
two major, successful global health initiatives. HEALTH SECURITY States
have a history of formal international agreements addressing health
matters and health threats, particularly infectious diseases, from the
Decree of Quarantine in Ragusa-Dubrovnik in 1377 (Mackowiak and Sehdev
2002) to the International Sanitary Conference in 1851 (Fidler 2003) and
the revised International Health Regulations in 2007 (Davies et al.
2015). However, [the treatment of [health as a 'low]{.mark} politics'
[priority]{.mark} at the international level [remained]{.mark} the case
[through most]{.mark} of the formative years of
[nation-building]{.mark}]{.underline} in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries (Fidler 1999). This was [in spite of its great strategic
benefit for colonial era expansion, winning wars and rapid
industrialisation]{.underline} (Diamond 1997). In contemporary politics,
a range of actors -- such as foreign governments, non-governmental
organisations (NGOs), pharmaceutical companies, private donors, and
international organisations -- drive a variety of different health
agendas that influence priorities within individual states and affect
the resources that are available to individual health workers and
opportunities for patients (Youde 2012). Likewise, the post--Second
World War Bretton Woods system had a profound influence upon health-care
policy and practice around the world, with key lending institutions like
the World Bank promoting particular health-care systems and policies in
their lending programmes (Sridhar 2012). In this period, key discourses
such as 'Health for All', the Essential Medicines List, and Right to
Health emerged in the absence of linkage to security. These discourses
brought in a range of actors including international organisations,NGOs
and transnational corporations with the power to shape health
opportunities and outcomes within and amongst states (Gagnon and Labonté
2011). In the 1990s, however, foreign and defence ministries became
increasingly interested in global health policy -- particularly
infectious diseases -- which would be referred to as having a
'securitising' effect on health (McInnes and Lee 2006). 14 ADVOCATING
GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY 255 During the 1990s, key events combined with a
paradigm shift in International Relations (IR) and security studies
(particularly in Western developed countries with the end of the Cold
War) (Paris 2001) to connect security to health (Enemark 2007; Collier
and Lakoff 2008). Acute awareness was growing amongst Western states
that they were not immune to health events such as infectious disease
outbreaks. The outbreak and spread of HIV across developing and
developed countries during the 1980s; fear of biosecurity attacks with
the breakdown of security in laboratories across the former Soviet Union
(Koblentz 2010); sudden outbreak of the plague in India in 1995 and the
arrival of West Nile virus near New York City in 1999; and the return of
'slow-burn' diseases thought eradicated such as Tuberculosis (TB),
measles and meningitis in the United States, United Kingdom, and
Australia (Price- Smith 2002). As well, new strains of disease, such as
haemorrhagic dengue fever and drug-resistant malaria were on the rise
due to significant climate change impact in South Asia, Southeast Asia,
and Pacific (Kim and Schneider 2013). Andrew Price-Smith argues that
prior to President Clinton's appointment of the National Science Council
on Emerging and Re-Emerging Infectious Diseases in 1995, developed
states had grown complacent to the fact that 'despite their enormous
technological and economic power, it is extremely unlikely that
developed countries will be able to remain an island of health in a
global sea of disease' (2002: 122). Clinton's move created a wave of
interest in other developed countries, particularly the United Kingdom,
Australia, and Canada, all shifting to appreciate and contextualise
health threats in foreign policy terms (McInnes and Lee 2012: 32). Until
then, on the rare occasion that health policy was discussed at the
international level it was in relation to (mostly) infectious disease
outbreaks such as plague and cholera, or large-scale efforts such as the
mass immunisation programme led by WHO to eradicate smallpox. During
infectious disease outbreaks, emphasis had been squarely placed on the
responsibility of the host state and regardless of the capacity of its
public health system to effectively respond (Fidler 1999). Meanwhile,
the spread and scale of HIV/AIDS raised fears about its potential to
threaten state cohesion and national economies. There was a particular
focus on military forces being at risk of HIV infection, and the
political insecurity these infectious could bring in societies (Singer
2002; Elbe 2006). The apparent potential for HIV/AIDS to cause state
collapse or serious disruption that could ricochet throughout
neighbouring states 256 S.E. DAVIES was considered a realistic scenario
in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as some parts of South and East Asia and
the Pacific (Shisana et al. 2003; Ramiah 2006; Price-Smith et al. 2007).
It was specific reference to the threat of HIV/AIDs on peacekeepers that
led to the first resolution on health, Resolution 1308, being passed in
the UN Security Council in 2000 (UNSC 2000). In response to these
developments, a host of analysts, including Solomon Benatar (1998,
2002), Peter W. Singer (2002), Robert Ostergard (2002), called for IR to
engage with the economic, humanitarian, political, and security
ramifications of the AIDS epidemic. At the same time, David Fidler and
Andrew Price-Smith called for equal attention to the economic,
political, and social insecurity that stems from a range of infectious
diseases already prevalent in countries (Fidler 2003; Price-Smith 2002).
Using quantitative analysis of the relationship between infectious
diseases and state capacity, Price-Smith claimed that 'infectious
disease \[already\] constitutes a verifiable threat to national security
and state power' (Price-Smith 2002: 19). Health security, Price-Smith
(2002: 9) argued, referred to the threat of the disease on particular
populations as well as the country's economic and political stability
becoming unsustainable as a result of a pathogen wiping out the core
population base. While a disease may have a different impact in
different states: \[I\]ncreasing levels of disease correlate with a
decline in state capacity. As state capacity declines and as
pathogen-induced deprivation and increasing demands upon the state
increase, we may see an attendant increase in the incidence of chronic
sub-state violence and state failure. State failure frequently produces
chaos in affected regions as neighbouring states seal their borders to
prevent the massive influx of disease-infected refugee populations.
Adjacent states may also seek to fill the power vacuum and may seize
valued territory from the collapsing state, prompting other proximate
states to do the same and so exacerbating regional security dilemmas.
(Price-Smith 2002: 15) In a similar vein, David Fidler's seminal 1999
book International Law and Infectious Diseases argued that with the
increased risk of drug-resistant microbes in the twenty first century,
as identified by public health officials (Institute of Medicine 1992;
Heymann 1996), it will become important to 'understand the international
politics of infectious disease control, or microbialpolitik' (Fidler
1999: 19). Microbialpolitik, argued Fidler, was 'wrapped up not only in
traditional concerns such as sovereignty and power but also in the
implementation of scientifically sound infectious disease policies at
the national and international levels' (ibid.). Both Fidler and
Price-Smith argued that the risk of newly emerged infectious diseases
and drug-resistant infectious diseases required that all governments
engage with the problem as if they were threats to national security.
Likewise, Laurie Garrett argued in 2001 that 'a sound public health
system, it seems, is vital to societal stability and, conversely, may
topple in the face of political or social stability or whim. Each
affects the other: widespread political disorder or anti-governmentalism
may weaken a public health system, and a crisis in the health of the
citizens can bring down a government' (Garrett 2001: 5). These ideas
continued to influence the global politics of health into the
twenty-first century (Fidler 2009; Davies 2012). In a 2010 study on the
influence of global health on foreign policy, Feldbaum and his
colleagues found that most discussion and policy from diplomatic
engagement focused on the interplay of national interests and security,
which meant that most diplomacy focus and discussion was on the
containment of infectious diseases (Feldbaum et al. 2010: 87). At the
time, WHO also immersed itself in the health security argument:
Collaboration between Member States, especially between developed and
developing countries, to ensure the availability of technical and other
resources is a crucial factor not only in implementing the
\[International Health\] Regulations, but also in building and
strengthening public health capacity and the networks and systems that
strengthen global public health security will. (WHO 2007: 13) [Of
course, health diplomacy refers to the pursuit of international health
**cooperation**]{.underline} on matters of concern to states (Kickbusch
et al. 2007). [It is the amalgam of cooperation in areas where there is
the possibility of **genuine**]{.underline} technical
**[cooperation]{.underline}** [for a diverse range of
diseases]{.underline} (Youde 2012: 25). [However, [because
health]{.mark} diplomacy [involves]{.mark} the interplay of **[national
interests, power and diplomatic compromise]{.mark}**]{.underline},
'[[state interests have been critical to]{.mark} either the success or
obstruction of such [agreements]{.mark} . . . [and **issues of**]{.mark}
**national [security remain atop the foreign-policy
hierarchy']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Feldbaum et al. 2010: 87). The
counter-narrative to the health security discourse described above is
that the securitisation of health promotes an instrumental pursuit of
health. To capture foreign policy interest and engagement, global health
discussions produce a 'hierarchy of illnesses' whereby some health
issues receive interest and resources whilst other equally deadly health
matters do not (Youde 2012: 160). Jeremy Shiffman's (2006: 411--420)
work on the peaks and troughs of investment in global health initiatives
has revealed that despite disease burden to a population, some
infectious diseases (i.e. HIV/AIDS) consistently attract stronger
short-term investment from donor states -- primarily those that are
contagious or linked to the national security interests of donor states.
However, it would be a mistake to assume that the threat of infectious
disease alone encapsulated all diplomatic engagement with health issues
at the turn of the twenty-first century. The rise of non-traditional
security has also been attributed to the increased influence of the
introduction of different social science methods and theories to
International Security Studies (Buzan and Hansen 2009: 188). This has
influenced research into the subject matter of security studies and IR.
If insecurity and grievances amongst the population played a large part
in the civil wars that gripped the 1990s (Fearon and Laitin 2003),
engagement with health is not just a security concern for developed
states [[but]{.underline}]{.mark} also for developing states. In other
words, [appreciations of health [security were **not
one-dimensional**]{.mark}. It was possible to advocate for a vision of
health security that [sought to protect **individuals as much as
states**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, a human centred appreciation of
security -- coined 'human security' by the 1994 United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report (see MacFarlane
and Khong 2006) -- sought to redefine the 'traditional' security with
issues and concepts under the umbrella term 'non-traditional' security,
including health (Chalk 2006). Thus, there does appear to be a
significant relationship between international health events and the
direction of research and policy engagement (Davies 2012). In the last
decade, events such as the United Nations Security Resolution on
HIV/AIDS (S/Res/1308) and SARS create an explosion of IR engagement with
global health governance, particularly in the area of health security.
This 'phenomenon' has been witnessed again with the Ebola outbreak
(Youde 2014). Amongst all these engagements, two key approaches have
emerged. First, those who accept the inevitability of a 'narrow'
approach to health and IR, focused on infectious diseases and
bioterrorism as security threats (Koblentz 2012). Alternatively, there
are those who articulate a broader vision related to development, state
capacity, and cross-national health issues (Shiffman 2006; Nunes 2014;
Rushton and Williams 2012). One of the central claims of the former
approach is that [health securitisation is an effective way of
**galvanising diplomatic engagement amongst states and other actors**,
resulting in the allocation of political will and material
resources]{.underline} (Collier and Lakoff 2008; Elbe 2011; Hafner and
Shiffman 2013). In the next part of the chapter I examine this core
assumption. In particular, I explore whether the effectiveness of health
initiatives is tied to their securitisation, focusing on the examples of
two major health initiatives. I examine the Tobacco Free Initiative
(TFI) and the GAVI. Interest in these two cases comes from exploring the
above presumption that security and health, particularly concerning
infectious diseases, drives, and delivers policy momentum. While there
is debate about whether that momentum translates into 'real' policy
progress or whether it is mere rhetoric deployed at particular
crises/events with no lasting impact, there is no debate that health
security has dominated global health and foreign policy discourse
(Feldbaum et al. 2010; McInnes and Rushton 2013). Below, I briefly
examine the dominance of health security in successful global health
initiatives -- one where you would expect it to be deliberately deployed
(GAVI) and one where it was not (TFI). TFI and GAVI, I contend, are
interesting cases precisely because they confound the issueframing
conventions about the relationship between health and security.
CONFOUNDING EXPECTATIONS A global health initiative is defined in this
chapter as 'an emerging and global trend in health. They are usually
focused on state, international organisation and public--private
partnerships. Global initiatives typically target specific diseases and
are supposed to bring additional resources to health efforts' (WHO
2015). Case Selection and Discourse Analysis This section briefly
compares two international health initiatives: the TFI and GAVI. The TFI
sought to reach an international agreement under international law that
countries would adopt to regulate the sale and production of tobacco.
This global health initiative was in aid of preventing the unchecked
rise of tobacco related illnesses -- non-communicable diseases --
including cancer (various), emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and
diabetes (to name a few). In the case of the TFI, and in light of the
260 S.E. DAVIES literature discussion concerning health security above,
it would be expected that there was little to no presence of security
discourse in the early days of this initiative. It was (and is) about
introducing tobacco control legislation, addressing unregulated sale and
distribution of tobacco to address preventable tobacco-related diseases
in young populations in already over-burdened public health-care systems
(Roemer et al. 2005). In contrast, the GAVI is a public and private
partnership between states, international organisations, pharmaceutical
companies, and philanthropic donors that sought cooperation amongst this
diverse group of actors to manufacture, purchase and deliver life-saving
vaccines against deadly infectious diseases in the most remote,
dangerous and impoverished locations around the world. GAVI is,
ostensibly, the initiative where it would be expected to see initial
employment of 'security' rhetoric given it is addressing the health
insecurity of under five children in need of vaccination from, mostly,
contagious infectious diseases. In fact, the immediate previous
iteration of GAVI -- the Child Vaccination Initiative -- used security
type discourse such as 'mission', 'operation', and 'threat'' under the
steerage of a former US defence army medic (see Muraskin 2002). These
cases were also selected because they shared some important features.
Both the TFI and the GAVI are concerned with one specific health concern
-- tobacco and immunisation; both were launched within a similar time
where health security discourse was gaining policy attention; both
initiatives required the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including
national governments, to enjoy success. The main difference, of interest
to this chapter, is that the association of security with the health
issue confound the type of cases analysed to date in the IR literature
on global health security. I reveal below that the non-communicable,
'slow moving' health threat engaged more securitised discourse than the
high morbidity communicable health threat. The comparison of the two
cases was organised around a common framework involving three steps. 14
ADVOCATING GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY 261 First, understanding the rhetoric
and concepts used to frame the initiative. Each initiative has produced
a significant volume of material outlining its purpose, scope and
mandate. For the purposes of this chapter, I focused on the 'founding'
document for each initiative. In the case of TFI, the Framework
Convention on Tobacco Control, adopted by the World Health Assembly in
2003, 8 years after the Convention was first proposed in the 1995 World
Health Assembly. The Framework Convention was the outcome of the TFI and
details 'a regulatory strategy to address addictive substances; in
contrast to previous drug control treaties, the WHO Framework Convention
asserts the importance of demand reduction strategies as well as supply
issues' (WHO 2003). Included in the Framework Convention document
analysed is an Annex 2, which details the history of drafting the
Framework from 1995 to 2003. For GAVI, the document analysed is the GAVI
Meeting of the Proto-Board in Seattle, July 1999. This document details
GAVI's terms of reference, mission, objectives, functions, structure,
milestones, and budget priorities. An interest in the discourse used in
the founding document of each initiative is informed by the premise
outlined in the above literature -- to what extent security frames were
employed to justify, conceptualise, and operationalise these two global
health initiatives which remain, successfully, in place today. Second,
once accepting the premise that securitisation is deliberately engaged
the two documents were analysed to identify a set of 'benchmarks' to
guide its assessment of the extent to which a health initiative has
aligned with security. Both documents were examined in detail for the
presence of 'speech acts' (Hansen 2012) -- the initiative itself or
actors associated with the initiative identified an existential threat
or risk and speech acts that called for the adoption of extraordinary
measures. Was the initiative itself referred to as 'security', 'threat',
or 'risk'. Who was the 'referent object' identified -- the group
threatened; who was the functional actor capable of protecting the
referent object from the identified threat (Buzan et al. 1998: 26--39);
and what was the 'scale' of securitisation utitlised to emphasise the
need for extraordinary measures (Buzan and Weaver 2009). Third,
discourse analysis (Hansen 2012). In this case, the discourse within the
two documents were analysed using NVivo Software. For the purposes of
this chapter, I refer to three query searches conducted to analyse the
perspectives being presented in the two documents concerning the threat
the initiative is addressing, who the initiative is 'protecting' and 262
S.E. DAVIES who is responsible for such protection. To facilitate
answering these three levels of inquiry, three query searches within
NVivo of each document were conducted: (1) word frequency analysis, (2)
text search of 'security' terms and, and (3) text search of 'other'
normative terms (development, rights, economy). A word tree was then
developed for the second and third text searches with a 'in context'
search up to ten surrounding words (on either side) to enable
understanding of the context and usage of the key words, i.e. 'threat'
or 'poor' being searched in the document. The word frequency search
assisted with identifying the primary actors discussed in the documents
-- i.e. who was identified as the referent actor intended for that
initiative versus the functional actor necessary to give effect to the
initiative. Findings Discourse analysis of the TFI and GAVI documents
produced three key findings. The first, unexpected, find was that the
TFI initiative was framed just as much in security terms as was GAVI.
The number of securitisation 'speech acts' (Hansen 2012) searched and
located in the Framework Convention was practically the same at GAVI --
0.08% and 0.07%, respectively (speech act terms: secure, threat, risk,
mission, extraordinary, urgent). In both cases, the presence of security
language was less than 1% of each document. What was significant was
that in the search for 'other' normative terms (terms: responsible,
rights, develop, needs, poor) -- the Framework Convention was
comparatively high at 1.05%, and a similar search for GAVI came at 0.4%
references. However, given the Framework Convention is a legal document
the presence of 'right/rights' partly accounts for high percentage
compared to GAVI. Contextual analysis of these terms reveals further
detail in how the documents framed the problem, the referent actor and
the functional actor (see Table 14.1). In the Framework Convention --
despite higher use of 'other' (nonsecurity) normative language than GAVI
-- there is a clear disposition towards identifying the state as the
'functional' actor responsible for taking measures necessary to protect
the population from tobacco sale, use, and morbidity. The Convention
directly refers to populations at risk (women and minors) and the need
for member states to support civil society capacity to inform and
educate tobacco awareness in these populations. Again, this is a legal
instrument so the emphasis on member states is not surprising as they
are the only signatories. However, even in 'other normative' references
to rights, responsibilities and need -- primary emphasis remains on the
state as the functional actor protects the population at risk of
addiction rather than alternative dominant frames such as the right to
health, the right to information. The Framework Convention leans towards
more 'traditional' security language in conceptualising the
state--individual relationship concerning tobacco control: risk and risk
mitigation; threat and protection. In the case of GAVI, the 0.07%
security references in contrast with its 0.4% 'other' references hints
at a different frame being brought to this initiative. However, it is
not particularly clear until, again, the broader context of these terms
is analysed. In the case of GAVI the focus is overwhelming on the
'mission' of the alliance and ensuring institutional clarity to support
the primary focus -- the right of the child to immunisation. This is
clearly stated as seen above, particularly in the mission and
responsibility statements (Table 14.1). The only time the roles of
functional actors are associated with either security or other terms are
in the context of securing commitment from actors (broad range of board
membership from states to international organisations, pharmaceutical
companies, and civil society), and development of health sector
capacity. Despite GAVI addressing the containment of infectious disease,
there is no threat language present. Securitised speech acts are
practically absent -- even when 'security' terms are located. The
emphasis is overwhelming on rights and alleviating deprivation. Both
initiatives confound the expectations prior to analysis -- the
infectious disease focused initiative is 'under-securitised' in
comparison to the non-communicable focused initiative. Finally, hinted
at above, the emphasis on primary actors in these two documents revealed
key similarities -- both focus on the institutional arrangements and the
actors most closely associated with these arrangements. In the case of
GAVI the board (comprised of international organisation, civil society,
member states, pharmaceutical, and philanthropic members) is the primary
functional actor; in the case of the TFI, the actor that looms largest
is the organisation (namely, WHO) followed by signatory states to the
Convention. Discussion about the population who are to benefit and
arguably be empowered from these initiatives, is not discussed as much
as the organisation and accordingly the implementation arrangements
around the initiative itself. To some extent, given the nature of these
two documents, this is not surprising. However, its presence in two
documents for two very different initiatives may reveal that the
pathology of organisations rather than the framing of an initiative
requires further study when engaging with the comparative success and
failure of global health diplomacy (Barnett and Finnemore 2003;
Hanrieder 2015). 14 ADVOCATING GLOBAL HEALTH SECURITY 265 CONCLUSION
What is the value of securitisation when it comes to building and
sustaining global political interest in health issues? Some contend that
[global health security has not run its course and continues to have
utility in building state interest, particularly the resources of
foreign affairs and defence departments, to secure global health
diplomacy objectives]{.underline} (Kickbusch et al. 2007; Feldbaum et
al. 2010; Elbe 2011). Others contend it is a 'smokescreen' that captures
short bursts of attention that are episodic and may have immediate
impact but no essential 'follow through' (McInnes and Rushton 2013). In
this chapter, I explored how global health initiatives securitise and
what becomes of them. I deliberately chose two successful initiatives
with the expectation that one had securitised a conventional health
issue -- vaccine preventable infectious diseases -- and one had not --
tobacco regulation. In examining the cases of TFI and GAVI, I looked at
their core document: their mission and value statements reflected in,
respectively, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and the first
meeting documents of GAVI. Speech acts, identified as the hallmark of
securitising moves, were analysed in both documents and contrasted with
'non-securitisation' or 'other normative' language. The Framework
Convention engaged in more securitising language or 'speech acts'
compared to GAVI but both contained more references to human rights and
responsibilities discourse. In neither case did it appear as if actors
had taken a conscious decision to securitise the issue any more than
they chose to articulate the issue in terms of human rights obligations.
In the case of the Framework Convention [[where]{.mark} a [focus on
security was]{.mark} expected and to a greater extent [seen]{.mark} here
[was an **equal**]{.mark}**ly strong [presence]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[of]{.underline} **[human rights and 'sovereignty as responsibility'
language]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [The [security discourse]{.mark} may
have **[helped capture attention]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[but]{.mark} it
[was **not the only** ]{.mark}**discursive [tool at
play]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and neither did it]{.underline}]{.mark}
obviously **[[displace other discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In the
case of GAVI, the initiative identified its primary mission as
fulfilling the rights of the child; whereas for TFI, emphasis was member
states fulfilling their responsibility to address the threat of tobacco
related illness from tobacco usage. GAVI appears to have a single
referent -- the right of the child to health via immunisation; while TFI
related to a multitude of actors. [[The **operationalisation**
of]{.mark} the [initiative(s)]{.mark} and their embeddedness in global
health architecture [dominated]{.mark} the
[discussion]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[far more than]{.mark} the [framing

[a]{.mark} relatively [small part of]{.mark} the [discourse compared to

health initiatives reveals is that whilst security discourse might help
**capture**]{.underline} the **[attention]{.underline}** of states, [it
has]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[overtaken other
policy frames]{.underline}** such as human rights and 'sovereignty as

not whether the [international]{.mark} community should be engaged with
these issues, but the appropriate **institutional design for

4 Discussion and conclusion

[There are dozens of **emerging**]{.underline} and new
[**tech**nologies]{.underline} and innovations that are to come in the
foreseeable future. [However, it is hard to imagine them now, especially
the all possibilities of their convergence. Due to the uncertainty and
because "all technologies are inherently prone to potential misuse
and]{.underline} \[...\] [the necessary **regulations usually lag**
behind the technologies]{.underline}" \[1\], [**fears** among the public
can arise. This is **nothing new**, but the **recent research** is
relatively **scarce**]{.underline} and sometimes art (literature, film)
is better in portraying the fears or the security threats generated by
technological change, that are perceived.

[The reviewed **[academic lit]{.mark}**erature [identifies]{.mark} some
**[tech]{.mark}nological [threats]{.mark}** that are relatively likely
and (will be) intensive [such as **cyber**]{.mark}-attacks,
**[a]{.mark}**rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} robotics, and
[**[biotech]{.mark}**nologies]{.underline}. In the Czech political
discourse, [[we identified]{.mark} especially the [securitization of
robotics]{.mark} and automation]{.underline}, particularly [[in relation
to the auto]{.mark}motive [industry]{.mark}]{.underline} that produces a
substantial part of the country's GDP. [There are fears that they will
lead to loss of employment]{.underline} and ensuing social and economic
instability. [Specialized national agencies and official documents also
often mention cyber-threats]{.underline}. [[**But** the rest]{.mark} of
all the possible concerns and threats [is **entirely
absent**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the Czech narrative.

Unsurprisingly, the Czech public only repeats the [**[fears verbalized
in politics]{.mark} and policies**, [but even those **securitization
moves** are **not**]{.mark} **very [successful]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The biggest threat perceived at the beginning of 2019 was water scarcity
and then other mainstream fears such as terrorism or migration.
Therefore, [[we]{.mark} can **[confirm]{.mark}**]{.underline} Hauptman's
observation that ["[the **public** is]{.mark} rather **[badly

Czech politicians and experts should accept the fact that, apart from
the hope of solutions of the problems we face, new technologies can
become security threats through having unintended consequences or being
misused. They should also expect that the public fears do not
necessarily have to reflect the "objective" existence, intensity, or
nature of threats, but they can be "only" perceived or imagined and,
thus, still have unsettling social and economic effects. Politicians and
experts should intensify the public discussion in order to become better
at managing technological change and to avoid the previously mentioned
issues. There is also potential for further research in the Czech
context, concretely to learn if and how Czech scientists, researchers,
and experts see technological change and innovation as technology
threats and which solutions they suggest.

Environmental Apocalypse: How Imagining the End Facilitates Moral

Environmental Apocalypticism and Activism As we saw in the introduction,
critics often argue that apocalyptic rhetoric induces feelings of
hopelessness or fatalism. While it certainly does for some people, in
this section I will present evidence that [apocalypticism]{.underline}
also [often goes hand in hand with activism]{.underline}. Some of the
strongest evidence of a connection between environmental apocalypticism
and activism comes from a national survey that examined whether
Americans perceived climate change to be dangerous. As part of his
analysis, Anthony Leiserowitz identified several "interpretive
communities," which had consistent demographic characteristics but
varied in their levels of risk perception. [The group who perceived the
risk to be the greatest]{.underline}, which he labeled "alarmists,"
[described climate change]{.underline} \[End Page 5\] [using apocalyptic
language, such as]{.underline} "Bad...bad...bad...like [after nuclear
war...no vegetation]{.underline}," "Heat waves, it's gonna kill the
world," [and "Death of the planet]{.underline}" (2005, 1440). Given such
language, this would seem to be a reasonable way to operationalize
environmental apocalypticism. [[If]{.mark} such [apocalypticism
encouraged fatalism]{.mark}, we would [expect alarmists to be less
likely]{.mark} to have engaged in environmental behavior]{.underline}
compared to groups with moderate or low levels of concern. [[To the
contrary]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [Leiserowitz found that
alarmists "were [significantly more likely to have taken personal
action]{.mark} to reduce greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}" (ibid.)
[than respondents who perceived climate change to pose less of a
threat]{.underline}. Interestingly, while one might expect such radical
views to appeal only to a tiny minority, Leiserowitz found that [a
respectable eleven percent of Americans fell into this
group]{.underline} (ibid). Further supporting Leiserowitz's findings,
[in a separate national survey]{.underline} conducted in 2008, Maibach,
Roser-Renouf, and Leiserowitz found that [a group]{.underline} they
[labeled "the Alarmed]{.underline}" (again, due to their high levels of
concern about climate change) "[are]{.underline} the segment [most
engaged in the issue of global warming. They are very convinced it is
happening, human-caused, and a serious and urgent threat. The Alarmed
are already making changes in their own lives and support an aggressive
national response]{.underline}" (2009, 3, emphasis added). [This group
was far more likely than people with lower levels of concern over
climate change to have engaged in consumer activism]{.underline} (by
rewarding companies that support action to reduce global warming with
their business, for example) or to have contacted elected officials to
express their concern. Additionally, the authors found that ["\[w\]hen
asked which reason for action was most important]{.underline} to them
personally, [the Alarmed were most likely to select preventing the
destruction of most life on the planet]{.underline} (31%)" (2009,
31)---a finding suggesting that for many in this group [[it is
specifically the desire to avert catastrophe]{.mark}, rather than some
other motivation, [that encourages pro-environmental
behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. Taken together, these and other studies
(cf. Semenza et al. 2008 and DerKarabetia, Stephenson, and Poggi 1996)
provide important evidence that [many of those who think environmental
problems pose a severe threat practice some form of activism, [rather
than giving way to fatalistic resignation]{.mark}]{.underline}. National
surveys give a good overview of the association between apocalypticism
and activism among the general public, but they do not \[End Page 6\]
provide sufficient ethnographic detail. To complement this broader
picture I now turn to case studies, which provide greater insight into
how adherents themselves understand what motivates their environmental
behavior. When seeking a subset of environmentalists with apocalyptic
beliefs, the radical wing is an obvious place to look. For example, many
Earth First!ers believe that the collapse of industrial society is
inevitable (Taylor 1994). At the same time, the majority are actively
committed to preventing ecological disaster. As Earth First! co-founder
Howie Wolke acknowledged, the two are directly connected: "As ecological
calamity unravels the living fabric of the Earth, environmental
radicalism has become both common and necessary" (1989, 29).3 This logic
underlies efforts to preserve wilderness areas, which many radical
environmentalists believe will serve as reservoirs of genetic diversity,
helping to restore the planet after industrial society collapses (Taylor
1994). [In addition to encouraging activism to preserve wilderness,
apocalyptic beliefs also motivate]{.underline} practices such as
"monkeywrenching," or ecological sabotage, civil disobedience, and the
more conventional "[paper monkeywrenching" (lobbying, engaging in public
information campaigns to shift legislative priorities]{.underline}, or
using lawsuits when these tactics fail). Ultimately, while there are
disagreements over what strategies will best achieve their desired
goals, for most radical environmentalists, apocalypticism and activism
are bound closely together. The connection between belief in impending
disaster and environmental activism holds true for Wiccans as well.
During fieldwork in the southeastern United States, for example, Shawn
Arthur reported meeting "dozens of Wiccans who professed their
apocalyptic millenarian beliefs to anyone who expressed interest, yet
many others only quietly agreed with them without any further
elaboration" (2008, 201). For this group, the coming disaster was
understood as divine retribution, the result of an angry Earth Goddess
preparing to punish humans for squandering her ecological gifts (Arthur
2008, 203). In light of Gaia's impending revenge, Arthur found that
Wiccans advocated both spiritual and material forms of activism. For
example, practices such as Goddess worship, the use of herbal remedies
for healing, and awareness of the body and its energies were considered
important for initiating a more harmonious relationship with the earth
(Arthur 2008, 207). As for material activism, Arthur notes \[End Page
7\] that the notion of environmental apocalypse played a key role in
encouraging pro-environmental behavior: images of immanent \[sic\]
ecological crisis and apocalyptic change often were utilized as
motivating factors for developing an environmentally and ecologically
conscious worldview; for stressing the importance of working for the
Earth through a variety of practices, including environmental activism,
garbage collecting, recycling, composting, and religious rituals; for
learning sustainable living skills; and for developing a special
relationship with the world as a divine entity. (2008, 212) What these
studies and my own experiences in the environmentalist milieu4 suggest
is that [people who make a serious commitment to engaging in
environmentally friendly behavior, [people who move beyond making
superficial changes to making substantial and permanent ones, are quite
likely to subscribe to]{.mark} some form of [the apocalyptic
narrative]{.mark}]{.underline}. All this is not to say that
apocalypticism directly or inevitably causes activism, or that believing
catastrophe is imminent is the only reason people become activists.
However, it is to say that [activism and apocalypticism are
associated]{.underline} for some people, [and]{.underline} that [this
association is not arbitrary]{.underline}, for [there is something
uniquely powerful and compelling about the apocalyptic
narrative]{.underline}. Plenty of people will hear it and ignore it, or
find it implausible, or simply decide that if the situation really is so
dire there is nothing they can do to prevent it from continuing to
deteriorate. Yet [to focus only on the ability of apocalyptic rhetoric
to induce apathy, indifference or reactance is to ignore the evidence
that it also fuels quite the opposite]{.underline}---grave concern,
activism, and sometimes even outrage. It is also to ignore the
movement's history. From Silent Spring (Carson \[1962\] 2002) to The
Limits to Growth (Meadows et al 1972) to The End of Nature (McKibben
1989), apocalyptic arguments have held a prominent place within
environmental literature, topping best-seller lists and spreading the
message far and wide that protecting the environment should be a
societal priority. Thus, while it is not a style of argument that will
be effective in convincing everyone to commit to the environmental cause
(see Feinberg and Willer 2011), there does appear to be a close
relationship between apocalyptic belief and activism among a certain
minority. The next section explores the implications of that
relationship further. \[End Page 8\] The Apocalyptic Narrative as a
Framework for Moral Deliberation In discussing how apocalypticism
functions within the environmental community, it will be helpful to
analyze it as a type of narrative. I do so because the domain of
narrative includes both the stories that people read and write, as well
as those they tell and live by. By using narratives as data, scholars
can analyze experiential and textual sources simultaneously
(Polkinghorne 1988; Riessman 2000). To analyze environmental
apocalypticism as a type of narrative is not to suggest that
apocalyptics' claims about the future are fictional. Rather, it is to
highlight that the facts to which [environmentalists appeal have been
organized with particular goals in mind]{.underline}, goals which have
necessarily shaped the selection and presentation of those facts.
[Compelling environmental writers do not simply list every known fact
pertaining to the natural world, but instead select certain findings and
place them within a larger interpretive framework. Alone, each fact has
little meaning, but when woven into a larger narrative, a message
emerges. This process of narrativization is essential if a message is to
be persuasive]{.underline} (Killingsworth and Palmer 2000, 197), and has
occurred not only in the rapidly expanding genre of environmental
nonfiction, but in much scientific writing about the environment as well
(Harré, Brockmeier, and Mühlhäusler 1999, 69). [What defines narratives
as such is their beginning-middle-end structure]{.underline}, their
ability to "describe an action that begins, continues over a
well-defined period of time, and finally draws to a definite close"
(Cronon 1992, 1367). Here I will focus on the last of these elements,
the ending, because anything we can learn about how endings function
within narratives in general will be applicable to the apocalypse, the
most final ending of all. An ending is essential in order for a story to
be complete, but there is more to it than this. Endings are also key
because they establish a story's moral, the lesson it is supposed to
impart upon the reader. In other words, to know the moral of the story,
auditors must know the consequences of the actions depicted therein, so
there can be no moral without an ending. To take a simple example, when
we hear the story of the shepherd boy who falsely claims that a wolf is
attacking his flock of sheep in order to entertain himself at his
community's expense, what makes the lesson clear is that when a wolf
does attack his flock, the disenchanted town members refuse to come to
his aid. By clearly illustrating how telling lies can have \[End Page
9\] unpleasant consequences for the perpetrator, the ending reveals the
moral that lying is wrong. As Cronon explains, it is "\[t\]he difference
between beginning and end \[that\] gives us our chance to extract a
moral from the rhetorical landscape" (1992, 1370). Endings play a
similar role in environmental stories. In Al Gore's book Earth in the
Balance (1992), for example, he devotes over a third of the book's pages
to presenting scientific evidence that disaster is imminent.5 As he sums
it up, "Modern industrial civilization...is colliding violently with our
planet's ecological system. The ferocity of its assault on the earth is
breathtaking, and the horrific consequences are occurring so quickly as
to defy our capacity to recognize them" (1992, 269). He builds this
argument so carefully precisely because if the ending does not seem
credible, the moral he wants readers to draw from the story will not be
compelling. [If]{.underline} his [readers are not convinced that the
ending to this story of ecological misbehavior will be a debacle of
colossal proportions, they will not become convinced that they need to
dramatically alter their ecological behavior]{.underline}. Thus the
vision of future catastrophe that Gore presents provides a crucial
vantage point from which the present environmental situation can be
understood as the result of a grand moral failure, and Gore's readers
are made aware of their obligations in light of it. Gore himself
appreciates the importance of this recognition, arguing that "whether we
realize it or not, we are now engaged in an epic battle to right the
balance of our earth, and the tide of this battle will turn only when
the majority of people in the world become sufficiently aroused by a
shared sense of urgent danger to join an all-out effort" (1992, 269,
emphasis added). Here, as in so many other stories, the ending must be
in place for the moral to become clear. To say that endings are
essential in order for stories to have morals is already to hint that
[stories alter behavior,]{.underline} that [they can encourage action in
the real world even as they invoke an imaginary one]{.underline}. This
much is clear from Earth in the Balance (1992): Gore does not just want
people to grasp a moral, to perceive some ethic in the abstract---he
wants them change their behavior in the here and now. In constructing a
narrative with this goal in mind, he is banking on the ability of
powerful stories to motivate social change, to be, as Cronon puts it,
"our chief moral compass in the world" (1992, 1375). Mark Johnson's
insightful synthesis of cognitive science and philosophy helps explain
further how this process of moral guidance occurs. For \[End Page 10\]
Johnson, narrative is fundamental to our experience of reality, "the
most comprehensive means we have for constructing temporal syntheses
that bind together and unify our past, present, and future into more or
less meaningful patterns" (1993, 174). [Narratives are also critical to
our ability to reason morally, an activity which]{.underline} Johnson
asserts [is fundamentally imaginative]{.underline}. In this view, [we
use stories to imagine ourselves in different scenarios, exploring and
evaluating the consequences of different possible actions in order to
determine the right one]{.underline}. Moral deliberation is thus ...an
imaginative exploration of the possibilities for constructive action
within a present situation. [We have a problem to solve here and
now]{.underline} (e.g., 'What am I to do?'.... 'How should I treat
others?'), [and we must try out various possible continuations of our
narrative in search of the one that seems best to resolve the
indeterminacy of our present situation]{.underline}. (1993, 180) Put
another way, what cognitive science has revealed is that [from an
empirical perspective the process of moral deliberation entails
constructing narratives rooted in our unique history and circumstances,
rather than applying universal principles]{.underline} (such as Kant's
categorical imperative) [to particular cases. That we use narratives to
reason morally is not a result of conscious choice but of how human
cognition works]{.underline}. That is, insofar as we experience
ourselves as temporal beings, a narrative framework is necessary to
organize, explain, and ultimately justify the many individual decisions
that over time become a life. Formal principles may be useful in
unambiguous textbook cases, but in real life "we can almost never decide
(reflectively) how to act without considering the ways in which we can
continue our narrative construction of our situation" (Johnson 1993,
160). Empirically speaking, "our moral reasoning is situated within our
narrative understanding" (Johnson 1993, 180, italics in original). The
observation that people use narratives to reason morally may help
explain the association between environmental apocalypticism and
activism. [The function of the [apocalyptic narrative]{.mark} may be
that it [helps]{.mark} adherents [determine how to act]{.mark} by
providing a storyline from which they can imaginatively sample, enabling
them to assess the consequences of their actions]{.underline}. In order
to answer the question, "Should I drive or walk to the store?" for
example, they can reason, "If I walk, that will reduce my carbon
footprint, which will help keep the ice caps from melting, saving humans
and other species." It is their [access to this narrative of
impending]{.underline} \[End Page 11\] [disaster]{.underline} that
[makes such reasoning possible, for it provides a simple framework
within which people can consider and eventually arrive at some
conclusion about their moral obligations]{.underline}.6 More broadly, it
can guide entire lives by providing a narrative frame of reference that
imbues the individual's experiences with meaning. For example, it is the
context of looming anthropogenic apocalypse which suggests that
dedicating one's life to achieving a healthier relationship with the
natural world is a worthwhile endeavor. [Absent the apocalypse, choices
such as limiting one's travel to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}, becoming vegetarian, working in the
environmental sector (often for less compensation), or growing one's own
food [could seem to be meaningless sacrifices]{.underline}. Within this
context, on the other hand, such choices become essential features of
the quest to live a moral life. [The apocalyptic narrative]{.underline}
is but one of many ways to tell the environmental story, yet it is one
that [seems particularly well-suited to encouraging pro-environmental
behavior]{.underline}. First, [the apocalyptic ending discloses certain
everyday decisions as moral decisions. [Without the narrative context of
impending disaster, decisions]{.mark} such as whether to drive or walk
to the store [would be merely matters of convenience]{.mark} or
preference]{.underline}. In the context of potentially disastrous
consequences for valued places, people, and organisms, by contrast, such
decisions become matters of right and wrong. Second, [[putting
info]{.mark}rmation about the environment [into narrative form enables
apocalyptics to link]{.mark} complex [global environmental processes to
their own lives]{.mark}]{.underline}, a perceptual technique Thomashow
describes as "bringing the biosphere home" (2002). Developing this skill
is essential because [[without that]{.mark} felt sense of
[connection]{.mark} to their own lived experience, [people are much less
likely to]{.mark} become convinced that it is incumbent upon them to
[act]{.mark}]{.underline} (2002, 2). Finally, the sheer magnitude of the
impending disaster increases the feeling of responsibility to make good
on one's moral intuitions. By locating individuals within a drama of
ultimate concern, the narrative frames their choices as cosmically
important, and this feeling of urgency then helps to convert moral
deliberation into action. With this conceptual overview in place, we can
now examine more closely what the relationship between apocalypticism
and moral reasoning looks like in practice. \[End Page 12\]

It is no longer a question that [human interaction with the world is

[Nevertheless]{.underline}, within [academic communities]{.underline}
people [are divided over which discursive tactic]{.underline},

particular orientation that [ecocriticism **most effectively produces

[This **demands including human-induced ecocidal violence** within all

This is [not to argue that interrogating people's discourse, tactics,
ontological orientation, or anything else lacks merit]{.underline}.
Timothy Luke, Chair and Distinguished Professor of Political Science at
the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, explains that¶ Because nothing in
Nature simply is given within society, such terms must be assigned
significance by every social group that mobilizes them\[.\] \... Many
styles of ecologically grounded criticism circulate in present-­‐day
American mass culture, partisan debate, consumer society, academic
discourse, and electoral politics as episodes of ecocritique, contesting
our politics of nature, economy, and culture in the contemporary global
system of capitalist production and consumption. (1997: xi)¶ Luke
reminds us that regardless of how ecocritics advance their agenda they
always impact our environmental awareness and therefore alter our
surrounding ecology. In doing so he shows that both literal governmental
policies and the symbolic universe they take place within reconstruct
the discourses utilized to justify policy and criticism in the first
place. This is why films like The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 can put
forth realistic depictions of government response to environmental
apocalypse. And despite being fictional, these films in turn can
influence the reality of governmental policy. Even the science-­‐fiction
of weather-­‐controlling weapons are now only steps away from becoming
reality2.¶ [Oftentimes [it takes images of **planetary annihilation** to
**motivate people** into action]{.mark} after years of sitting idly by
watching things slowly decay]{.underline}. In reality [it takes
awareness of impending disaster [to **compel policymakers**]{.mark} to
en**act**]{.underline} even piecemeal [reform]{.underline}. On the
screen [it takes the **actual appearance** of ecological apocalypse to
**set the plot in motion**]{.underline}. What is constant is that "as
these debates unfold, visions of what is the good or bad life \... find
many of their most compelling articulations as ecocritiques \... \[that
are\] [mobilized for and against various projects of power and economy
in the organization of]{.underline} our [everyday
existence]{.underline}" (Luke 1997: xi). [We **cannot motivate people**
to **change the ecological conditions** that give rise to **thoughts of
theorization** without reference to the **concrete environmental
destruction** ongoing in reality. This means that, **[even when]{.mark}
our [images of apocalypse aren't]{.mark} fully [accurate]{.mark}**, our
[use of]{.mark} elements of [**scientifically-established reality**
reconstructs]{.mark} the surrounding [power structures in beneficial
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. When we ignore either ecological metaphors or
environmental reality we only get part of the picture.\`¶ [In recent
years]{.underline}, many [ecocritics have shied away from]{.underline}
the very [metaphors that compel a sense of urgency.]{.underline} They
have largely done so [out of the [**fear** that]{.mark} its [deployment
will get **co-opted by hegemonic institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Such critics [ignore how what we advocate **alters our understanding of
ourselves**]{.mark} to the surrounding ecology]{.underline}. In doing
so, [our advocacies [render]{.mark} such [co-optation **meaningless**
because of the possibility to **redeploy**]{.mark} **our
[metaphors]{.mark} in the future**]{.underline}. In the upcoming
sections, I will provide an overview of how poststructuralist thinkers
like Michel Foucault and Martin Heidegger influence some ecocritics to
retreat from omnicidal rhetoric. This retreat minimizes the main
objectives of their ecocriticism. I argue that [[rather than withdrawing
from images of apocalypse]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[we should
**utilize them**]{.mark} **in subversive ways** [to]{.mark} disrupt the
current relationship people have to their ecology]{.underline}.
Professor of Sociology at York University, Fuyuki Kurasawa argues that
"[instead of bemoaning]{.underline} the contemporary preeminence of a
[dystopian imaginary]{.underline} \... [it can [enable]{.mark} a novel
form of **[transnational socio-political action]{.mark}** \... that can
be termed **[preventive foresight]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \... [\[I\]t
is a mode of ethico-political practice enacted by participants in the

**Stevens, 18**---Lecturer in Global Security, King's College London
(Tim, "Exeunt Omnes? Survival, Pessimism and Time in the Work of John H.
Herz," Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 46, No. 3, pp.
283-302, dml) \[ableist language modifications denoted by brackets\]

Herz explicitly combined, therefore, a political realism with an ethical
idealism, resulting in what he termed a 'survival ethic'.65 This was
applicable to all humankind and its propagation relied on the generation
of what he termed 'world-consciousness'.66 Herz's [implicit recognition
of an **open** yet **linear temporality** allowed him to
**[imagine]{.mark} possible [futures]{.mark}** aligned [with]{.mark} the
[survival]{.mark} ethic, [whilst]{.mark} **at the same time [imagining
futures]{.mark} in [which humans become extinct]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
His [**pessimism** about the latter **did not preclude** working towards
the former.]{.underline} As Herz recognised, [it was one thing to
develop an ethics of survival but quite another to **translate theory
into practice**. What was [required]{.mark} was a **collective**,
**transnational** and **inherently [interdisciplinary effort]{.mark}**
[to address]{.mark} **nuclear**]{.underline} and environmental
[**issues** and to problematize notions of security]{.underline},
sustainability and survival [in the context of **[nuclear
geopolitics]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the technological transformation
of society. Herz proposed various practical ways in which young people
in particular could become involved in this project. One idea floated in
the 1980s, which would alarm many in today's more cosmopolitan and
culturally-sensitive IR, was for a Peace Corps-style 'peace and
development service', which would 'crusade' to provide 'something
beneficial for people living under unspeakably sordid conditions' in the
'Third World'.67 He expended most of his energy, however, from the 1980s
onwards, in thinking about and formulating 'a new subdiscipline of the
social sciences', which he called 'Survival Research'.68 Informed by the
survival ethic outlined above, and within the overarching framework of
his realist liberal internationalism, Survival Research emerged as
Herz's solution to the shortcomings of academic research, public
education and policy development in the face of global catastrophe.69 It
was also Herz's plea to scholars to venture beyond the ivory tower and
become -- excusing the gendered language of the time -- 'homme engagé,
if not homme révolté'.70 His proposals for Survival Research were far
from systematic but they reiterated his life-long concerns with nuclear
and environmental issues, and with the necessity to act in the face of
threats to human survival. [The **principal responsibilities**
of]{.underline} survival [**[researchers]{.mark}** were two-fold. One,
to [**raise awareness** of survival]{.mark} issues in the minds of
[**policy-makers** and]{.mark} the **[public]{.mark}**, and to
**demonstrate the [link]{.mark} between political [inaction]{.mark}
now** [and]{.mark} its effect on **subsequent human [survival]{.mark}**.
Two, to **suggest** and **shape [new attitudes]{.mark}** more
'appropriate to the solution of new and unfamiliar survival problems',
[rather than]{.mark} **relying on [ingrained modes]{.mark} of thought**
and **practice**]{.underline}.71 The primary initial purpose, therefore,
of Survival Research would be to identify scientific, sociocultural and
political problems bearing on the possibilities of survival, and to
begin to develop ways of overcoming these. This was, admittedly,
non-specific and somewhat vague, but the central thrust of his proposal
was clear: ['In our age of global survival concerns, it should be the
**primary responsibility of scholars** to engage in survival
issues']{.underline}.72 Herz considered **[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}** an
essential disciplinary contributor to this endeavour, one that should be
promiscuous across the social and natural sciences. It [**[should not be
afraid to think the worst]{.mark}**, if the worst is at all possible,
and to **[establish the various requirements]{.mark}**]{.underline} --
social, economic, political -- [[of 'a **livable
world**']{.mark}.]{.underline}73 How this long-term project would
translate into global policy is not specified but, consistent with his
previous work, Herz identified the need for shifts in attitudes to and
awareness of global problems and solutions. Only then would it be
possible for 'a turn round that demands leadership to persuade millions
to change lifestyles and make the sacrifices needed for survival'.74
Productive pessimism and temporality In 1976, shortly before he began
compiling the ideas that would become Survival Research, Herz wrote: For
the first time, we are compelled to take the futuristic view if we want
to make sure that there will be future generations at all. Acceleration
of developments in the decisive areas (demographic, ecological,
strategic) has become so strong that even the egotism of après nous le
déluge might not work because the déluge may well overtake ourselves,
the living.75 [Of significance here is **[not]{.mark} the appeal to
[futurism]{.mark} per se**]{.underline}, although this is important,
[but the suggestion this is 'the **first time**' futurism is **necessary
to ensuring human survival**. This is]{.underline} Herz the realist
declaring a break with conventional realism: Herz is [**not bound to a
cyclical vision** of political or historical time in which events and
processes reoccur over and again]{.underline}. His [identification of
nuclear weapons]{.underline} as an 'absolute novum' in international
politics [demonstrates this belief in the **non-cyclical nature of
humankind's unfolding temporality**]{.underline}.76 As Sylvest observes
of Herz's attitude to the nuclear revolution, ['the horizons of meaning
it produced installed a **temporal break** with the past, and
simultaneously carried a **promise for the future**']{.underline}.77
[This 'promise for the future' was **[not]{.mark}**, however, a
**[simple liberal]{.mark} view** of a **better future consonant with
human [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. His autobiography is clear that
his [experiences of **Nazism** and the **Holocaust** destroyed all
remnants of any original belief in '**inevitable
progress**']{.underline}.78 His [frustration at scientism, technocratic
deception, and the brutal rationality of twentieth-century killing, all
but **demanded a rejection** of the **liberal dream** and the
**inevitability of its consummation**. If the 'new age' ushered in by
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, he wrote, [is characterised by anything,
it is by its '**indefiniteness of the age** and the **uncertainties of
the future**'; it was **impossible** under these conditions to **draw
firm conclusions** about the future course of international
politics]{.underline}.79 Instead, he recognised the contingency,
precarity and fragility of international politics, and the ghastly
tensions inherent to the structural core of international politics, the
security dilemma.80 Herz was uneasy with [both **cyclical** and
**linear-progressive ways** of perceiving historical time]{.underline}.
The former 'closed' temporalities are endemic to versions of realist IR,
the latter to post-Enlightenment narratives feeding liberal-utopian
visions of international relations and those of Marxism.81 In their own
ways, [each **marginalises** and **diminishes** the contingency of the
social world in and through time, and the **agency of political actors**
in effecting change]{.underline}. Simultaneously, [each **shapes the
futures that may be imagined** and **brought into being**]{.underline}.
Herz recognised this danger. Whilst drawing attention to his own gloomy
disposition, he warns that [without care and attention, 'the
**assumption may determine the event**']{.underline}.82 As a pessimist,
Herz was alert to the hazard of succumbing to negativity, cynicism or
resignation. E.H. Carr recognised this also, in [the difference
between]{.underline} the ['**deterministic pessimism**']{.underline} of
'pure' realism [and]{.underline} those **[realists]{.underline}** 'who
have made their mark on history'; [the latter **may be pessimists** but
they still believe 'human affairs can be **directed** and **modified**
by human action and human thought']{.underline}.83 Herz would share this
anti-deterministic perspective with Carr. Moreover, [the **possibility
of agency** is a product of a temporality 'neither **temporally closed**
nor **deterministic**, neither **cyclical** nor **linear-progressive**;
it is [**rooted in contingency**']{.mark}]{.underline}.84 Again quoting
from his autobiographical account of the impact of Nazism, Herz
described the relationship between his early pessimism and his
developing intellectual stance: The world became a theatre of the
absurd. Suicide would probably have been the logical next move, and I
considered it from time to time. But I was still too young for such a
radical step. One thing, however, emerged: a growing interest in
domestic and, above all, international politics. My complete resignation
was no longer appropriate. If not from within, fascism might perhaps
still be destroyed from without. To my continuing interest in theory,
therefore, was added a practical interest in action.85 Channelling the
spirit of E.H. Carr, he wrote of this 'brutal awakening' to the nature
of power politics in the 1930s that, 'Study could no longer be "pure"
research; it had to become research committed to warn of the deadly
peril and show the way to the necessary action.'86 His commitment to
active engagement was an early one, gestated during his personal
experiences of Nazism in the 1930s.87 This desire to combat Nazism from
the outside was manifest in his activities for the Allies during and
after World War II but it coloured his scholarly life also. Herz
recognised pessimism was a powerful force in his life but, rather than
overcome or mask it, he used it to propel his intellectual project
further, and to engage with, not withdraw from, the world. He was, as
van Munster and Sylvest relate, '\[d\]eeply pessimistic yet a committed
social thinker'.88 Herz was explicit about this: [a **realistic** and
**consistent pessimism** can clarify where we are and prepare us to do
what is necessary]{.underline}.89 [Pessimism is a **necessary
component** of a realistic view of the world, upon which **proper** and
**reasoned action can be founded**]{.underline}. In this sense,
[[pessimism]{.mark} can be **productive**. It [**produces positive
outcomes through action**, rather than **negative ones through
inaction**]{.mark} or **resignation**. These are **subjective
value-judgements**]{.underline}, to be sure, [but are obtained through a
**process of realist engagement with the world**, rather
than]{.underline} blind [\[mere\] **fumbling** or **ideological
railroading**]{.underline}. [Survival]{.underline} Research [was a
**response to**]{.underline} Herz's [**pessimism** about the future,
**not a rejection of it**]{.underline}. This leads us to two
observations about the relevance of pessimism to the study of
international relations. The first is that [pessimism **does not imply
disengagement** from the world]{.underline}. If anything, the example of
John Herz suggests the opposite. He was a pessimist, but his brand of
[[pessimism was no '**passive fatalism**']{.underline}]{.mark}.90 As he
recalled a few years before he died, 'I consider myself a realist who
comes sometimes to pessimistic conclusions, but never gives up looking
for solutions if ever so difficult ones'.91 [Pessimism can be [a **spur
to thought**]{.mark} and to **action** and **need [not be a watchword
for conservatism]{.mark}** in theory or practice]{.underline}.92 This is
not to say being a pessimist is easy. Morgenthau, for his part, 'never
flagged in efforts to use his conceptual skills to help improve the
human condition', despite his [pessimism]{.underline} about the ability
and will of people to take the long view on significant political
issues.93 This [required that scholars **chart different paths** through
troublesome times and [**articulate alternative visions** of
international order, not to **preclude political action** but to
**facilitate it**]{.mark}]{.underline}; not quite the conservative
position realism is often assumed to occupy.94 [In the face of worldly
frustrations and horrors, [it is this **attention to the production of
alternative futures** that prevents 'pessimism from **turning into
fatalism**]{.mark}']{.underline}.95 The second observation is that [it
is **unhelpful and misleading** to treat pessimism and optimism as
**oppositional**]{.underline}.96 Pessimism and optimism are commonly
regarded as antonyms but often enjoy a symbiotic relationship. In Herz,
[they **mingle** and **cross-pollinate** in ways that defy easy
explication]{.underline}. Stirk claims, for instance, that Herz's
[optimism about how the world could be refashioned 'was **never more
than guarded**']{.underline}, restrained by his fierce attachment to the
importance of the security dilemma.97 Puglierin notes that his 'blatant
pessimism' (eklatanter Pessimismus) was always accompanied by some form
of optimism.98 We are reminded of Gramsci's famous statement regarding
'pessimism of intellect, optimism of the will' as the cognitive binary
at work in the political mind.99 [Even as]{.underline} his [pessimism
deepened]{.underline} over the course of his career, he was
**[always]{.underline}** wont to **[end]{.underline}** his [**analyses**
with a '**yet**' or '**in spite of it all**']{.underline}.100
Importantly, as he became more pessimistic, 'the solutions he proposed
became ever more ambitious'.101 His [growing pessimism was accompanied
by increasing resolve to **tackle the problems of the world
head-on**]{.underline}, although, as he admitted in a footnote in the
1980s, 'Not for a moment do I have the illusion that what I have
proposed is likely to happen'.102 A suitably pessimistic aside, perhaps,
but it did not deter him from continuing his project for another twenty
years. [This drive seems not to be rooted in **optimistic conviction**,
nor even a **subtle version of hope**, but in a **properly pessimistic
reading** of the world and its possibilities, engendered as they were by
the **ontological temporality of perpetual change**.]{.underline}

Ethics of Securitization

As discussed in the literature review, [[securitization]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most [often [discussed as a
'**negative'**]{.mark}]{.underline} [concept]{.underline} for several
reasons. First of all, securitization argues that the normal democratic
procedures for decision makers be abandoned in favor of a streamlined
decision-making process handled by a small elite that dictate policy on
security related issues. [Critics assert that securitization
is]{.underline} something largely [inconsistent with the openness and
accountability that]{.underline} [liberal democratic systems
value]{.underline}, [therefore]{.underline} securitization [is something
'negative' to be avoided]{.underline} in societies that place true
importance on these values. [But [what if **the issue**]{.mark} **being
securitized** [is a **direct threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} those very [democratic procedures themselves. Are there
issues [that **deserve to be securitized**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}[for the **common good**]{.underline}, [and can government
policies have a **positive impact on society** when these issues are
**securitized?**]{.underline}

[Experts on **disinformation**]{.underline} [warn of the **dire
potential** that such **propaganda** can have on a society]{.underline},
and argue that liberal democracies are especially vulnerable to them.
New technologies have made the 21st century into a completely different
type of information space than its predecessor. [The internet has
decentralized and democratized the flow of information]{.underline} to
the point where somebody sitting on a laptop at home may be able to make
the same impact with a blog as a major newspaper with an article. [With
less institutional control and traditional media gatekeeping on the flow
of information, the internet is a **truly democratic
platform**]{.underline}.148 These democratic processes; freedom of
information, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and free
elections; are precisely what make liberal democracies so vulnerable to
disinformation and propaganda. With knowledge of these asymmetric
vulnerabilities[, the Kremlin **consciously aims** "to **take
advantage** of the **free flow of information** in a democratic society,
the **effect of that information on public opinion**, and the
**electoral mechanisms**]{.underline} [through which public opinion
determines a country's leadership]{.underline}."149

[One foundation of a democratic society is the ability to make decisions
in the public forum **based on shared truth**.]{.underline} When voters
go to the polls, they may make a judgement on which candidate or which
proposal they favor based on the information that they have consumed.
Traditionally, they may differ on what course of action may be the best
way to handle a problem, but there is an agreed upon reality that is a
matter of fact; it is shared. [Disinformation, from Russia and other
actors hostile to the West, **promotes falsehoods** to the point where
society **cannot have a shared truth**.]{.underline} Imagine four people
each with a different source of news. One reads the New York Times, one
watches Fox News, one reads Breitbart, and one watches RT. Each one of
these people will not only come to radically different conclusions about
what solutions are best for society, but also about what the basic facts
of reality are in the first place. One person may be out on the streets
protesting the disappearance and rape of a young Russian girl by Muslim
migrants, while the next person may be aware that the story is a
complete falsehood that never happened to begin with. [[Russian
efforts]{.mark} in the EU [show]{.mark} that [these situations **are
not**]{.mark} **a hysterical [fear-mongering]{.mark} reaction to new
technologies**]{.underline} and new sources of information,
[[but]{.mark} that they are **already a [reality]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Disinfo]{.mark}rmation [creates]{.mark} a situation where people can
have **[opposing realities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [because the
information they consume is **so radically different**]{.underline}
[from that of their neighbor.]{.underline} [**[Critical theory]{.mark}**
in international relations **[warns]{.mark}** that
[securitization]{.mark} **[subverts]{.mark} democratic
[decision-making]{.mark} processes**]{.underline}, [[but
**disinfo**]{.mark}**rmation** [**destroys** these]{.mark} very
democratic [processes]{.mark}]{.underline} that are so fundamental for
liberal democratic societies to function the way they are intended. It
is impossible to imagine normal democratic processes solving these types
of problems when those processes are being eroded by propaganda to the
point where Western societies may no longer have normal democratic
processes if this trend continues. In order to maintain these democratic
norms, [securitization may be a **necessary**]{.underline} [process,
even a 'positive' concept that can yield positive results]{.underline}
and protect the democratic values that have propelled the European
project into existence.

From the perspective of states, it is difficult to see why they would
not wish to securitize the issue of Russian disinformation more. States
tend to place an emphasis on matters of physical and territorial
security over all else, which is why issues such as nuclear weapons, or
rising military power in China, or international terrorism are
prioritized in terms of security policy. States' desire for physical
security explains why these issues tend to be some of the most
securitized political issues, with decisions made regarding military
policy in Afghanistan by military panels rather than public referendums.
Walt, arguing from the realist perspective, argues that states "place
particular emphasis on the preservation of the state's territorial
integrity and the physical safety of its inhabitants." 150 Material harm
is of the utmost importance while more ethereal issues, like democratic
procedures, freedom of the information space, and societal resilience
towards propaganda are not prioritized in the same way. Disinformation
has threatened some of the building blocks of democratic societies
throughout the EU, and if these democratic systems fail, it isn't
difficult to imagine that physical security would come under threat as
well. In the case of Spain, the issue of the Spanish government's
territorial sovereignty over Catalonia was attacked by Russian
disinformation, exacerbating the political wounds of the independence
referendum. The disinformation campaign questioned Spain's fundamental
right to exist in its current form, yet Spain did not place the
integrity of their media space as an important security issue despite
this. There needs to be a shift in the importance and value that
European democracies place on the fundamental democratic principles that
allow their system to flourish. They should be prioritized with the same
importance that states place on more traditional measures of power.
Securitization of disinformation with the liberal democratic system and
democratic processes themselves as the referent object, has the
potential to have a more 'positive' outcome than emphasis on hard power,
or immigration, or other issues that contribute to the 'negative'
conception of securitization.

Successful Securitization and Societal Resilience

In the case studies it is clear that [some European countries have
securitized Russian disinformation while some have not.]{.underline}
Namely, the United Kingdom and Lithuania have successfully securitized
disinformation, while Spain, Germany, and the supranational institutions
of the EU have not securitized disinformation. Those that have not
securitized, have identified Russian disinformation as a perceived
security threat and have several securitizing actors currently at play.
The potential audiences of the securitizing speech acts, those within
the security apparatus, NGOs, think-tanks, and even the wider public of
these countries have accepted that Russian disinformation is a security
threat that warrants greater action by their governments. Thus far, they
have not taken measures that could by any means be considered
extraordinary, having allocated a relatively small number of resources
and minimal effort towards combating disinformation, and therefore
cannot be considered to have securitized the issue. These countries, and
the EU, are possibly in the early stages of the process of
securitization, though this does not necessarily mean that they will
complete the process by taking more extraordinary measures against
disinformation. In fact, there could be a reversal and disinformation
could slip back into the realm of normal politics and become
desecuritized.

Some [clear trends emerge in the countries who have **successfully
securitized disinformation**]{.underline}. First[, propaganda narratives
have a **weaker effect on society** when disinformation **has been
securitized**,]{.underline} [**failing to have their desired
impact**]{.underline} and cause major rifts in the public. They also
show that [securitization of disinformation is possible **without**
implicitly **violating** democratic norms of freedom of speech and open
access to information]{.underline}. This becomes clear in looking at the
contrast between Lithuania's countermeasures against disinformation
compared to those of Germany and Spain. In Germany, the Lisa case was
dealt with almost exclusively via the normal criminal and legal
channels, with the police investigation into Lisa's accusations of
kidnap and rape by migrants and police handling of most public
statements related to the controversy. 151 They have begun to enact
minor laws that aim at punishing hate speech and disinformation when
posted on popular social media platforms as well.152 Spanish authorities
have started task forces devoted to alerting the national government
when disinformation narratives start to dominate a story online. 153
Spanish and German officials at the higher levels of national authority
in their respective foreign and defense departments gave minimal
statements regarding the controversies, and have preferred to continue
dealing with Russia through dialogue over more overt confrontation that
could complicate communication. Both Germany and Spain have taken a more
reactive approach to countering disinformation, choosing to deal with it
on a case-by-case basis as an incident unfolds.

Lithuania has taken similar messages to alert national authorities on
dangerous narratives as they develop online, but it has also taken
extraordinary measures that encompass a broader scope. The Lithuanian
government has supported efforts at every level of society; political,
economic, educational, and cultural. 154 Their wide spread programs
focus not only on dealing with each case as it emerges, but also on
strengthening the fundamental resilience of society at the source
through teaching media literacy in secondary schools, funding Russian
language media for the susceptible minority group, and sensitizing the
public to the dangers of propaganda by making disinformation a security
issue linked to the physical security and existence of the state.155
Their bans on Russian media channels during disinformation campaigns,
while possibly construed as violations of a free press, are necessary to
prevent media from spreading out right falsehoods. The news media, both
Lithuanian and Russian language, should be held accountable and has a
responsibility to act as a gatekeeper of the truth. Many media channels
in Lithuania have voluntarily chosen to follow such a route, choosing
not to report on 'fake' news stories that can be detrimental to society
by becoming 'real' news through regurgitation by legitimate media
outlets. It is important not to confuse the right of free speech of an
individual with that of a news organization with ties to a foreign
country, and such acts should not be considered violations of democratic
norms when it comes to protecting the fundamental values of democracy.

[The **countermeasures** taken by a country]{.underline} undoubtedly
[play a role in the **impact** disinformation narratives may have in
that country. With Lithuania's '**successful' securitization** of
disinformation]{.underline}, [**fake stories** and attempts at
**propaganda** have often **fallen on deaf ears**]{.underline}, with
little real success. [Lithuania's overarching, comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation is the **reason** the NATO rape
allegations]{.underline} **[failed to cause a large
disruption]{.underline}** [in the news cycle.]{.underline}156 [This
**strong contrast** is seen with Germany, where the story of a rape by
migrants of a young Russian girl caused an **uproar** and **led to
protests in Berlin**]{.underline} [and a **diplomatic row with
Moscow**]{.underline}. 157 Spain also fell short, with Russian
disinformation exacerbating a contentious independence referendum in
Catalonia and influencing public opinion at home and abroad on the
status of Catalan autonomy. [[Government policies that **fail to
securitize** ]{.mark}**disinformation** and **alert
society**]{.underline} [to the **dangers of propaganda**]{.underline}
[[lead to **false stories** having **explosive
consequences**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Both Spain and Germany's strategies of dealing with disinformation
narratives as they arise is simply not effective enough. The state can
spend time and resources trying to discredit every fake news story that
finds its way to the public forum, but there will always be one to take
its place. It is like fire prevention; a fire alarm can be an important
part of fire prevention, alerting the fire department to come extinguish
a blaze. But there are more important measures as well, such as building
structures with fire resistant materials, or teaching people what to do
in case of a fire. These types of continuous measures, like the policies
Lithuania pursues, make society more resilient and prevent
disinformation from causing a fire in the first place.

[Policies aimed at improving societal resilience towards disinformation
are being utilized in other countries with successful outcomes as
well]{.underline}. Latvia uses a sweeping media literacy program from an
early age to improve critical thinking in its citizens.158 Finland, a
country with a long history of hostility with Russia, uses similar
programs, emphasizing not only the need to publicly correct false
narratives, but also the importance of creating a positive
counternarrative to disinformation that is repeatedly applied to offer
an alternative vision.159 [These countermeasures **only appear** in
countries that have **securitized disinformation**]{.underline}, as
Finland and Latvia have similar histories as Lithuania and treat
disinformation in similar terms, and they are much more promising than
government authorities attempting to play catchup with internet trolls
and false stories.

Internationalization of Countermeasures

Another key conclusion comes from the other [case of successful
securitization in the United Kingdom. The UK, in its **securitization of
disinformation**]{.underline} [following the assassination attempt on
Sergei Skripal, **internationalized the threat**]{.underline} [by
creating a set of countermeasures]{.underline} [that could be
implemented **along with its allies**]{.underline}. The UK successfully
convinced 20 allies to expel Russian diplomats in a coordinated effort
at punishing Putin's regime for the incident and the subsequent
disinformation surrounding it.160 [Theresa May, as a securitizing actor,
not only convinced her public in the UK of disinformation as a security
threat,]{.underline} [but **convinced the international
community**]{.underline} [that such behavior "**threatens the security
of us all**]{.underline}." 161 Compared with the minimal Spanish
attempts at coordinating counter disinformation at the EU level, and
German attempts to keep the Lisa Case under the authority of Berlin's
police department[, British efforts at securitizing their incident by
bringing it to the **attention of the international community** and
launching a **unified response** were **highly
successful.**]{.underline}

This lesson of internationalization should be critical for the EU to
deal with disinformation. [[Securitization needs to take place]{.mark}
not only at the **national level** of member]{.underline} [states, but
also [at the **supranational level**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}of
the EU as an institution. The EU itself is under threat of Russian
disinformation just as much as individual member states, with experts
warning of further regionalization of Europe and the EU after Brexit. In
this critical time for the continued existence of the EU, [the threat of
disinformation "[requires]{.mark} new [international instruments]{.mark}
to manage it." 162 Thus far, member states have shown a preference for
taking **individual routes**]{.underline} in order to deal with
disinformation. [The importance **of joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[could be especially important during **elections**]{.underline}, a time
in which the ability of national and EU authorities to cooperate is
critical. During the European elections of 2019 for example, consisting
of four days of simultaneous elections across 28 individual member
states, "the failure of one government to properly mitigate
disinformation efforts threatens the credibility of the entire electoral
process." 163 This problem of coordination cannot be understated, as
some countries do not even have their own systems in place to monitor
disinformation, allowing "local and national actors to spread fake news
more freely" and leaving these countries defenseless against
propaganda.164

[It is essential]{.underline} for the EU [to act as a
**bloc**]{.underline} [and start **joint initiatives**]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} **[counter disinformation]{.underline}**. [Russian
efforts]{.underline}, as shown in the case studies, are not exclusive to
one particular area of Europe, but **[threaten all member
states]{.underline}**. Issues Russia chooses to target; the migrant
crisis, espionage, the use of chemical weapons in a member state, the
solidarity and legitimacy of the NATO, and even the territorial
sovereignty of some countries; should alarm every single member of the
EU. These issues are not unique to one country, but they are issues that
countries even outside of the EU are currently confronting. Europe is
targeted as a bloc, and therefore it should respond as a bloc. Such a
response, as seen in with the UK's diplomatic expulsion, has a larger
impact as a bloc rather than individually. Division will only encourage
more provocations. [Acting on a **unified front** in securitizing
disinformation and reacting with countermeasures will do much more
[to]{.mark} potentially **[deter Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
continuing down the same path in its relations with Europe. The EU needs
to stop hesitating, and start throwing its full weight on the economic,
political, and informational fronts.

'Positive' Securitization

The two [trends discussed in the sections above also show that
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation [can be securitized **without**]{.mark} **wide
[violations of democratic norms]{.mark}** and]{.underline}
**[exclusionary tactics]{.underline}** [towards Russian minorities in
Europe]{.underline}. [By arguing for securitization, this paper is not
arguing that democratic principles should be **thrown out** in favor of
**extraordinary measures**]{.underline} [that subvert the democratic
process]{.underline}, indeed the democratic process is of the utmost
importance because these principles are the referent object of a
European push to securitize disinformation. [And according to
polls]{.underline} in all of the countries involved in the case studies
and the EU as a whole, [the general public agrees that disinformation
**constitutes a security threat**]{.underline} that could be detrimental
to liberal democratic norms. Efforts like media literacy, cooperation
with news organizations, and comprehensive strategies that deal with
disinformation at every level of society are still extraordinary without
necessarily violating democratic norms. These [[policies]{.mark} [aim to
**sensitize the public** ]{.mark}**to
disinformation**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [They **do [not]{.mark}** aim
[to]{.mark} **[monitor]{.mark} the public [in a surveillance
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[and]{.underline} **[punish
individual views]{.underline}** that are unfavorable to European states.
[On the other hand, these policies are not afraid to prevent large news
outlets from **spreading lies** that harm the ability to make democratic
decisions **based on shared truths.**]{.underline} [Diplomatic expulsion
and unprecedented international cooperation on information issues are
extraordinary]{.underline} [measures taken **without abuse of state
power**]{.underline} [as in the **War on Terror**]{.underline}.
[Policies that aim to provide alternative news sources to Russian
speaking minorities in Europe **are not** **exclusionary
'othering**]{.underline},' [but are **inclusive**]{.underline} [and
offer a **broader**, **diverse**, and]{.underline} **[more
positive]{.underline}** [view]{.underline} [of the Russian diaspora than
as a monolithic fifth-column prone to side with Moscow and Putin's
regime over their new homes.]{.underline} These policies need to be
inclusive to mitigate the risk of disinformation and the subsequent
disillusion with European governments. A conscious, just policy of
securitization of disinformation must take democratic principles,
inclusion of diverse viewpoints, and the treatment of Russian minorities
into account while avoiding the misuse of state power in order to
succeed.

Conclusion

This thesis aimed to identify similar processes occurring throughout the
EU by analyzing how four individual member states have approached the
issue of disinformation. In looking at incidents of disinformation in
the UK, Germany, Lithuania, and Spain, research was conducted to analyze
the incidents themselves and how governments responded, placing that
response into the wider context of securitization within those
countries. It is clear that [there is an **ongoing process of
securitization** taking place in Europe around the issue of
**disinformation**]{.underline}. [Not all countries]{.underline}
researched [have demonstrated that disinformation has been **fully
securitized**]{.underline}, but every country had elements of
securitization taking place, such as securitizing actors and speech acts
meant to draw attention to propaganda as an existential security threat.
While these countries did show the initial factors in securitization
occurring, they chose to deal with disinformation through the route of
normal politics rather than extraordinary politics. It can be concluded
that [the]{.underline} [**[level of securitization]{.underline}** [of
Russian disinformation]{.underline}]{.mark} **[within a
society]{.underline}**, [that is the treatment of propaganda and false
narratives as a security threat and how deep a country is within the
process of securitization, [played]{.mark} a **direct [role]{.mark}**
[in **shaping**]{.mark} **the [policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} [those
countries pursued in order to **counter disinformation**]{.underline}.

Examining the different cases, the research showed how history,
experience, and threat perceptions related to Russia influenced
securitization of disinformation. The United Kingdom securitized Russian
disinformation in the aftermath of a catalyst event, the attempted
assassination of former GRU agent Sergei Skripal and the subsequent
disinformation campaign in its aftermath. The UK government propelled
disinformation to extraordinary politics in its diplomatic expulsion of
Russian diplomats coordinated with its allies. Lithuania securitized
Russian disinformation over a long period of time because of its complex
history with Russia and the Soviet Union, and its experience of a slow
barrage of disinformation since it regained independence. Due to decades
of experience, Lithuania pursues a more comprehensive strategy at
countering disinformation, which seeks to address the threat at multiple
levels of society and multiple stages as false-narratives spread.

It was clear that other countries, and the EU as an organization, had
not fully securitized Russian disinformation, although they showed signs
they were in the process of securitization. Germany, in response to a
young girl's explosive accusations of rape in the context of the migrant
crisis, showed a clear preference for dealing with disinformation
through the normal political channels of Berlin's police department.
Spain took minimal responses through its foreign and defense ministries
and is still in the early stages of instituting policies aimed at
alerting the government to disinformation narratives. As a bloc, the EU
also failed to enact extraordinary policies to counteract disinformation
from Europe's Eastern neighbor, with a lack of coordination between the

/GoGreen!

At this naked moment in the American experiment, when many people
perceive civilization on the verge of blowing up in some metaphorical
sense, there is an elderly man in California hoping to seize your
attention about another possibility. It is that [civilization is on the
verge of blowing up]{.underline} in a non-metaphorical sense. William J.
Perry is 89 now, at the tail end of one of his generation's most
illustrious careers in national security. By all rights, the former U.S.
secretary of Defense, a trained mathematician who served or advised
nearly every administration since Eisenhower, should be filling out the
remainder of his years in quiet reflection on his achievements. Instead,
he has set out on an urgent pilgrimage. [Bill Perry has
become]{.underline}, he says with a rueful smile, "[a prophet of
doom.]{.underline}" [His life's work]{.underline}, most of it highly
classified, [was [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---how to maximize
the fearsome deterrent power of the U.S. arsenal, how to minimize the
possibility that the old Soviet arsenal would obliterate the United
States and much of the planet along the way. Perry played a supporting
role in the Cuban Missile Crisis, during which he went back to his
Washington hotel room each night, fearing he had only hours left to
live. He later founded his own successful defense firm, helped
revolutionize the American way of high-tech war, and honed his
diplomatic skills seeking common ground on security issues with the
Soviets and Chinese---all culminating as head of the Pentagon in the
early years after the end of the Cold War. Nuclear bombs are an area of
expertise Perry had assumed would be largely obsolete by now, seven
decades after Hiroshima, a quarter-century after the fall of the Soviet
Union, and in the flickering light of his own life. Instead, [nukes
[are]{.mark} suddenly---insanely, by Perry's estimate---once again [a
contemporary nightmare, and]{.mark} an emphatically [ascendant]{.mark}
one. At the dawn of 2017, there is a Russian president making bellicose
boasts about his modernized arsenal. There is an American
president-elect who breezily free-associates on Twitter about starting a
new nuclear arms race. Decades of cooperation between the two nations on
[arms control is]{.mark} nearly [at a standstill]{.mark}. And, unlike
the original Cold War, this time there is a world of busy fanatics
excited by the prospect of a planet with more bombs---people who have
already demonstrated the desire to slaughter many thousands of people in
an instant, and are zealously pursuing ever more deadly means to do
so]{.underline}. [And there's one other difference from the Cold War:
[Americans no longer think about the threat]{.mark} every
day]{.underline}. [Nuclear war isn't the subtext]{.underline} of popular
movies, or novels; [disarmament has fallen far from the top of the
policy priority list. The largest upcoming generation, the [millennials,
were raised]{.mark} in a time [when the problem felt]{.mark} largely
[solved,]{.mark} and it's easy for them to imagine it's still quietly
fading into history. The problem is, [it's no longer fading]{.mark}.
"Today, [the danger of]{.mark} some sort of a [nuclear catastrophe is
greater]{.mark} than it was during the Cold War," Perry said in an
interview in his Stanford office, "and most people are blissfully
unaware of this danger."]{.underline} It is a turn of events that has an
old man newly obsessed with a question: Why isn't everyone as terrified
as he is? Perry's hypothesis for the disconnect is that [much of [the
population]{.mark}, especially that rising portion with no clear
memories of the first Cold War, [is suffering from a deficit of
comprehension]{.mark}. Even [a single nuclear explosion]{.mark} in a
major city [would represent an]{.mark} abrupt and possibly [irreversible
turn]{.mark} in modern life, upending the global economy, forcing every
open society to suspend traditional liberties and remake itself into a
security state. "The political, economic and social consequences are
beyond what people understand," Perry says. And yet [many]{.mark} people
[place this scenario in]{.mark} roughly the same category as the meteor
strike that supposedly wiped out the dinosaurs---frightening, to be
sure, but something of [an abstraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. So Perry
regards his last great contribution of a 65-year career as [[a crusade
to stimulate the public imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}---to share the
vivid details of his own nightmares. He is doing so in a recent memoir,
in a busy public speaking schedule, in half-empty hearing rooms on
Capitol Hill, and increasingly with an online presence [[aimed
especially at young people]{.underline}]{.mark}. He has enlisted the
help of his 28-year-old granddaughter to figure out how to engage a new
generation, including through a series of virtual lectures known as a
MOOC, or massive open online course. He is eagerly signing up for "Ask
Me Anything" chats on Reddit, in which some people still confuse him
with William "The Refrigerator" Perry of NFL fame. He posts his
ruminations on YouTube, where they give Katy Perry no run for her money,
even as the most popular are closing in on 100,000 views. One of the
nightmare scenarios Perry invokes most often is designed to roust
policymakers who live and work in the nation's capital. The terrorists
would need enriched uranium. Due to the elaborate and highly industrial
nature of production, hard to conceal from surveillance, fissile
material is still hard to come by---but, alas, far from impossible. Once
it is procured, with help from conspirators in a poorly secured overseas
commercial power centrifuge facility, the rest of the plot as Perry
imagines it is no great technological or logistical feat. The mechanics
of building a crude nuclear device are easily within the reach of
well-educated and well-funded militants. The crate would arrive at
Dulles International Airport, disguised as agricultural freight. The
truck bomb that detonates on Pennsylvania Avenue between the White House
and Capitol instantly kills the president, vice president, House
speaker, and 80,000 others. Where exactly is your office? Your house?
And then, as Perry spins it forward, how credible would you find the
warnings, soon delivered to news networks, that five more bombs are set
to explode in unnamed U.S. cities, once a week for the next month,
unless all U.S. military personnel overseas are withdrawn immediately?
[[If]{.mark} this [particular scenario does not resonate]{.mark} with
you, Perry can easily rattle off a long roster of
others]{.underline}---a regional war that escalates into a nuclear
exchange, a miscalculation between Moscow and Washington, a computer
glitch at the exact wrong moment. [[They are all]{.mark} ilks of [the
same theme]{.mark}---the dimly understood threat that the science of the
20th century is set to collide with the destructive passions of the
21st.]{.underline} "We're going back to the kind of dangers we had
during the Cold War," Perry said. "I really thought in 1990, 1991, 1992,
that we left those behind us. We're starting to re-invent them. [We and
the Russians and others don't understand that what we're doing is
re-creating those dangers---or maybe they don't remember the dangers.
For younger people, they didn't live through those dangers]{.underline}.
But when you live through a Cuban Missile Crisis up close and you live
through a false alarm up close, you do understand how dangerous it is,
and you believe you should do everything you could possibly do to
\[avoid\] going back." For people who follow the national security
priesthood, the dire scenarios are all the more alarming for who is
delivering them. Through his long years in government Perry invariably
impressed colleagues as the calmest person in the room, relentlessly
rational, such that people who did not know him well---his love of music
and literature and travel---regarded his as a purely analytical mind,
emotion subordinated to logic and duty. Starting in the 1950s as a
technology executive and entrepreneur in some of the most secretive
precincts of the defense industry, he gradually took on a series of
high-level government assignments that gave him one of the most quietly
influential careers of the Cold War and its aftermath. Fifteen years
before serving as Bill Clinton's secretary of defense, Perry was the
Pentagon official in charge of weapons research during the Carter
administration. It was from this perch that he may have had his most
far-reaching impact, and left him in some circles as a legendary figure.
He used his office to give an essential push to two ideas that
transformed warfare over the next generation decisively to American
advantage. One idea was stealth technology, which allowed U.S. warplanes
to fly over enemy territory undetected. The other was precision-guided
munitions, which allowed U.S. bombs to land with near-perfect accuracy.
During the Clinton years, Perry so prized his privacy that he initially
turned down the job of Defense secretary---changing his mind only after
Clinton and Al Gore pleaded with him that the news media scrutiny
wouldn't be so bad. The reputation he built over a life in the public
sphere is starkly at odds with this latest highly impassioned chapter of
Perry's career. Harold Brown, who also is 89, first recruited Perry into
government, and was Perry's boss while serving as Defense secretary in
the Carter years. "No one would have thought of Bill Perry as a
crusader," he says. "But he is on a crusade." Lee Perry, his wife of
nearly 70 years, is living in an elder care facility, her once buoyant
presence now lost to dementia. Perry himself, lucid as ever, has seen
his physical frame become frail and stooped. Rather than slowing his
schedule, he has accelerated his travels to plead with people to awaken
to the danger. A trip to Washington includes a dinner with national
security reporters and testimony on Capitol Hill. Back home in
California, he's at the Google campus to prod engineers to contemplate
that their world may not last long enough for their dreams of technology
riches to come true. He's created an advocacy group, the William J.
Perry project, devoted to public education about nuclear weapons. He's
enlisted both his granddaughter and his 64-year-old daughter, Robin
Perry, in the cause. But if his profile is rising, his style is
essentially unchanged. He is a man known for self-effacement, trying to
shape an era known for relentless self-promotion, a voice of quiet
precision in a time of devil-take-the-hindmost bombast. The rational
approach to problem-solving that propelled his career and won him
adherents and friends in both political parties and even among some of
America's erstwhile enemies remains his guide---in this case, by
endeavoring to calculate the possibilities and probabilities of a
terrorist attack, regional nuclear war, or horrible miscalculation with
Russia. ["I want to be very clear," he said. "[I do not think it is a
probability]{.mark} this year or next year or anytime [in the
foreseeable future. But the consequence is so great, we have to take it
seriously.]{.mark} And [there are things to]{.mark} greatly [lower those
possibilities]{.mark} that [we're]{.mark} simply [not
doing.]{.mark}"]{.underline} \*\*\* Perry really did not expect he would
have to write this chapter of his public life. His official career
closed with what seemed then an unambiguous sense of mission
accomplished. By the time he arrived in the Pentagon's top job in 1994,
the Cold War was over, and the main item on the nuclear agenda seemed to
be cleaning up no-longer-needed arsenals. As defense secretary, Perry
stood with his Russian counterpart, Pavel Grachev, as they jointly blew
up missile silos in the former Soviet Union and tilled sunflower seeds
in the dirt. "I finally thought by the end of the '80s we lived through
this horrible experience and it's behind us," Perry said. "When I was
secretary, I fully believed it was behind us." After leaving the
Pentagon, he accepted an assignment from Clinton to negotiate an end to
North Korea's nuclear development program---and seemed agonizingly close
to a breakthrough as the last days of the president's term expired. Now,
he sees his grandchildren inheriting a planet possibly more dangerous
than it was during his public career. No one could doubt that [the Sept.
11 terrorists would have gladly used nuclear bombs instead of airplanes
if they had had them, and it seems only a matter of time until they try.
Instead of a retreating threat in North Korea]{.underline}, that
fanatical regime [now possesses as many as eight nuclear bombs, and is
just one member of a growing nuclear club]{.underline}. Far from a new
partnership with Russia, Vladimir [Putin has given old antagonisms a
malevolent new face. American policymakers talk of spending up to \$1
trillion to modernize the nuclear arsenal. And now comes Donald Trump
with a long trail of statements effectively shrugging his shoulders
about a world newly bristling with bombs and people with reasons to use
them]{.underline}. Perry knew Hillary Clinton well professionally, and
says he admired both her and Bill Clinton for their professional
judgment though he was never a personal intimate of either. He was
prescient before the election in expressing skepticism about how voters
would respond to the dynastic premise of the Clinton campaign---a
healthy democracy should grow new voices---but was as surprised as
everyone else on Election Day. Donald Trump was not the voice he was
looking for, to put it mildly, but he has responded to the Trump cyclone
with modulated restraint. Perry said he assumes his most truculent
rhetoric isn't serious, the utterances of a man who assumed his words
were for political effect only and had no real consequences. Now that
they do, Perry is hoping to serve as a kind of ambassador to
rationality. He said he is hoping for audiences soon, with Trump if the
incoming president will see him, and certainly Trump's national security
team, which includes several people Perry knows, including Defense
Secretary nominee James Mattis. There is little doubt the message if the
meeting comes. "We are starting a new Cold War," he says. "We seem to be
sleepwalking into this new nuclear arms race. ... We and the Russians
and others don't understand what we are doing." "I am not suggesting
that this Cold War and this arms race is identical to the old one,"
Perry added. "But in many ways, it is just as bad, just as dangerous.
And totally unnecessary." \*\*\* Perry had been brooding over the
question for a year. It was in the early 1950s, he was still in his 20s,
and the subject was partial differential equations---the topic of his
Ph.D. thesis. A particular problem had been absorbing him, day in and
day out, hours and hours on end. Then, out of nowhere, a light came on.
"I woke up in the middle of the night, and it was all there," Perry
recalled. "It was all there, and I got out of bed and sat down. The next
two or three hours, I wrote my thesis, and from the first word I wrote
down, I never doubted what the last word was going to be: It was a magic
moment." The story is a reminder of something definitional about Bill
Perry. Before he became in recent years an apostle of disarmament,
before he sat atop the nation's war-making apparatus in the 1990s,
before he was the executive of a defense contractor specializing in the
most complex arenas of Cold War surveillance in the 1960s, he was a
young man in love with mathematics. In those days, Perry had planned on
a career as a math professor. His attraction to math was not merely
practical, in the way that engineers or architects rely on math. The
appeal was just as much aesthetic, in ways that people who are not
numbers people---political life tends to be dominated by word
people---cannot easily comprehend. To Perry's mind, there was a purity
to math, a beauty to the patterns and relationships, that was not unlike
music. Math for Perry represented analytical discipline, a way of
achieving mastery not only over numerical problems but any hard problem,
by breaking it down into essential parts, distilling complexity into
simplicity. This trait was why Pentagon reporters in the 1990s liked
spending time around Perry. When most public officials are asked a
question, one studies the transcript later to decipher a succession of
starts and stalls, sentence fragments and ellipses, that cumulatively
convey an impressionistic sense of mind but no clear fixed meaning.
Perry's sentences, by contrast, always cut with surgical precision. It
was one reason Clinton White House officials often held their breath
when he gave interviews---Perry might make news by being clear on
subjects, such as ethnic warfare in the Balkans or a nuclear showdown in
North Korea, that the West Wing preferred to try to fog over. "I've
never been able to attack a policy problem with a mathematical formula,"
he recalled, "but I have always believed that the rigorous way of
thinking about a problem was good. It separated the fact from the
bullshit, and that's very important sometimes, to separate what you can
from what you would hope you can do." [Perry wishes more people were
familiar with the concept of ["expected value."]{.mark} That [is
a]{.mark} statistical [way of understanding events of very large
magnitude that have a low probability.]{.mark} The large magnitude event
could be something good, like winning a lottery ticket. Or it could be
something bad, [like a nuclear bomb exploding]{.mark}. Because the odds
of winning the lottery are so low, the rational thing is to save your
money and not buy the ticket. As for a nuclear explosion, by Perry's
lights, [the consequences are so grave]{.mark} that [the rational thing
would be]{.mark} for people in the United States and everywhere to be in
a state of peak [alarm]{.mark} about their vulnerability, [and for
political debate to be dominated by]{.mark} discussion of how to reduce
[the risk]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [And just how high is the risk?
The answer of course is ultimately unknowable. Perry's point, though, is
that it's a hell of a lot higher than you think. Perry invites his
listeners to consider [all the various scenarios]{.mark} that might lead
to a nuclear event. "Mathematically speaking, you add those all together
in one year it [is]{.mark} still [just a possibility,]{.mark} not a
probability]{.underline}," he reckons. "[But then you go out ten, twenty
years and [each time this]{.mark} possibility [repeats]{.mark} itself,
and then [it starts to become a probability.]{.mark} How much time we
have to get those possibility numbers lower, I don't know. But [sooner
or later the odds are going to get us,]{.mark} I am
afraid]{.underline}." \*\*\* Almost uniquely among living Americans,
Bill Perry has actually faced down the prospect of nuclear war
before---twice. In the fall of 1962, Bill Perry was 35, father of five
young children, living in the Bay Area and serving as director of
Sylvania's Electronic Defense Laboratories---driving his station wagon
to recitals in between studying missile trajectories and the radius of
nuclear detonations. Where he resided was not then called Silicon
Valley, but the exuberance and spirit of creative possibility we now
associate with the region was already evident. The giants then were Bill
Hewlett and David Packard, men Perry deeply admired and wished to
emulate in his own business career. The innovation engine at that time,
however, was not consumer technology; it was the government's appetite
for advantage in a mortal struggle against a powerful Soviet foe. Perry
was known as a star in the highly complex field of weapons surveillance
and interpretation. So it was not a surprise, one bright October day,
for Perry to get a call from Albert "Bud" Wheelon, a friend at the
Central Intelligence Agency. Wheelon said he wanted Perry in Washington
for a consultation. Perry said he'd juggle his schedule and be there the
next week. "No," Wheelon responded. "I need to see you right away."
Perry caught the red-eye from San Francisco, and went straight to the
CIA, where he was handed photographs whose meaning was instantly clear
to him. They were of Soviet missiles stationed in Cuba. For the next
couple weeks, Perry would stay up past midnight each evening poring over
the latest reconnaissance photos and help write the analysis that senior
officials would present the next morning to President Kennedy. Perry
experienced the crisis partly as ordinary citizen, hearing Kennedy on
television draw an unambiguous line against Soviet missiles in this
hemisphere and promising that any attack would be met with "a full
retaliatory response." But he possessed context, about the capabilities
of weapons and the daily state of play in the crisis, that gave him a
vantage point superior to that of all but perhaps a few dozen people. "I
was part of a small team---six or eight people," he recounted of those
days 54 years earlier. "Half of them technical experts, half of them
intelligence analysts, or photo interpreters. It was a minor role but I
was seeing all the information coming in. I thought every day when I
went back to the hotel it was the last day of my life because I knew
exactly what nuclear weapons could do. I knew it was not just a lot of
people getting killed. It was the end of civilization and I thought it
was about to happen." It was years later that Perry, like other more
senior participants in the crisis, learned how right that appraisal was.
Nuclear bombs weren't only heading toward Cuba on Soviet ships, as
Kennedy believed and announced to Americans at the time. Some of them
were already there, and local commanders had been given authority to use
them if Americans launched a preemptive raid on Cuba, as Kennedy was
being urged, goaded even, by Air Force Gen. Curtis LeMay and other
military commanders. At the same time, Soviet submarines were armed and
one commander had been on the verge of launching them until other
officers on the vessel talked him out of it. Either event would have in
turn sent U.S. missiles flying. The Cuban Missile Crisis recounting is
one of the dramatic peaks in "My Journey on the Nuclear Brink," the
memoir Perry published last fall. It is a book laced with other close
calls---like November 9, 1979, when Perry was awakened in the middle of
the night by a watch officer at the North American Aerospace and Defense
Command (NORAD) reporting that his computers showed 200 Soviet missiles
in flight toward the United States. For a frozen moment, Perry thought:
This is it---This is how it ends. The watch officer soon set him at
ease. It was a computer error, and he was calling to see whether Perry,
the technology expert, had any explanation. It took a couple days to
discover the low-tech answer: Someone had carelessly left a
crisis-simulation training tape in the computer. All was well. But what
if this blunder had happened in the middle of a real crisis, with
leaders in Washington and Moscow already on high alert? The inescapable
conclusion was the same as it was in 1962: [[The world skirting nuclear
Armageddon]{.mark} as much [by good luck]{.mark} as by skilled crisis
management.]{.underline} Perry is part of a distinct cohort in American
history, one that didn't come home with the large-living ethos of the
World War II generation, but took responsibility for cleaning up the
world that the war bequeathed. He was a 14-year-old in Butler,
Pennsylvania when he heard the news of the Pearl Harbor attack in a
friend's living room, and had the disappointed realization that the war
might be over by the time he was old enough to fight in it. That turned
out to be true---he was just shy of 18 at war's end---a fact that places
Perry in what demographers have called the "Silent Generation," too
young for one war but already middle-aged by the time college campuses
erupted over Vietnam. Like many in his generation, Perry was not so much
silent as deeply dutiful, with an understated style that served as a
genial, dry-witted exterior to a life in which success was defined by
how faithfully one met his responsibilities. Perry said he became aware,
first gradually and over time profoundly, of the surreal contradictions
of his professional life. His work---first at Sylvania and then at ESL,
a highly successful defense contracting firm he co-founded in 1963---was
relentlessly logical, analyzing Soviet threats and intentions and coming
up with rational responses to deter them. But each rational move was
part of a supremely irrational dynamic---"mutually assured
destruction"---that placed the threat of massive casualties at the heart
of America's basic strategic thinking. It was the kind of framework in
which policymakers could accept that a mere 25 million people dead was
good news. Also the kind that in one year alone led the United States to
produce 8,000 nuclear bombs. By the end, the Cold War left the planet
with about 70,000 bombs (a total that is now down to about 15,500). "I
think probably everybody who was involved in nuclear weapons in those
days would see the two sides of it," Perry recalls, "the logic of
deterrence and the madness of deterrence, and there was no mistake, I
think, that the acronym was MAD." \*\*\* Perry has been at the forefront
of a movement that he considers the sane and only alternative, and he
has joined forces with other leading Cold Warriors who in another era
would likely have derided their vision as naïve. In January 2007, he was
a co-author of a remarkable commentary that ran on the op-ed page of the
Wall Street Journal. It was signed also by two former secretaries of
state, George Schulz and Henry Kissinger and by Sam Nunn, a former
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee---all leading military
hawks and foreign policy realists who came together to argue for
something radical: that [[the goal]{.mark} of U.S. policy [should
be]{.mark}]{.underline} not merely the reduction and control of atomic
arms, it should be [the ultimate [elimination of all nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. This sounded like gauzy utopianism,
especially bizarre coming from supremely pragmatic men. But Perry and
the others always made clear they were describing a long-term ideal, one
that would only be achieved through a series of more incremental steps.
The vision was stirring enough that it was endorsed by President Obama
in his opening weeks in office, in a March 2009 address in Prague. In
retrospect, Obama's speech may have been the high point for the vision
of abolition. "A huge amount of progress was made," recalled Shultz, now
93. "[Now [it is going in the other direction]{.mark}]{.underline}." "We
have less danger of an all-out war with Russia," in Nunn's view. "But
[we have more danger of some type of accident, miscalculation, cyber
interference, a terrorist group getting a nuclear weapon. It requires a
lot more attention than world leaders are giving it.]{.underline}"
Perry's goal now is much more defensive than it was just a few years
ago---halting what has become inexorable momentum toward reviving Cold
War assumptions about the central role of nukes in national security.
More recently he's added yet another recruit to his cause: California
Governor Jerry Brown. Brown, now 78, met Perry a year ago, after
deciding that he wanted to devote his remaining time in public service
mainly to what he sees as civilization's two existential issues, climate
change and nuclear weapons. Brown said he became fixated on spreading
Perry's message after reading his memoir: He recently gave a copy to
President Obama and is trying to bend the ear of others with influence
in Washington. If Bill Perry has a gift for understatement, Brown has a
gift for the theatrical. In an interview at the governor's mansion in
Sacramento, he wonders why everyone is not paying attention to his new
friend and his warnings for mankind. "He is at the brink! At the brink!
Not WAS at the brink---IS at the brink," Brown exclaimed. "But no one
else is." A California governor can have more influence, at least
indirectly, than one might think, due to the state's outsized role in
policy debates and the fact that the University of California's Board of
Regents helps manage some of the nation's top weapons laboratories,
which study and design nuclear weapons. Brown, who was a vocal critic in
the 1980s of what he called America\'s \"nuclear addiction,\" reviewed
Perry\'s recent memoir in the New York Review of Books, and said he is
determined to help his new friend spread his message. "Everybody is,
\'we are not at the brink,\' and we have this guy Perry who says we are.
It is the thesis that is being ignored.\" Even if more influential
people wake up to Perry's message---a nuclear event is more likely and
will be more terrible than you realize---a hard questions remains: Now
what? This is where Perry's pragmatism comes back into play. The
smartest move, he thinks, is to eliminate the riskiest part of the
system. If we can't eliminate all nukes, Perry argues, we could at least
eliminate one leg of the so-called nuclear triad, intercontinental
ballistic missiles. These are especially prone to an accidental nuclear
war, if they are launched by accident or due to miscalculation by a
leader operating with only minutes to spare. Nuclear weapons carried by
submarines beneath the sea or aboard bomber planes, he argues, are
logically more than enough to deter Russia. The problem, he knows, is
that logic is not necessarily the prevailing force in political debates.
Psychology is, and this seems to be dictating not merely that we deter a
Russian military force that is modernizing its weapons but that we have
a force that is self-evidently superior to them. It is an argument that
strikes Perry as drearily familiar to the old days. Which leads him the
conclusion that [[the only long-term way out is to persuade a younger
generation to make a different choice]{.underline}]{.mark}. His
granddaughter, Lisa Perry, is precisely in the cohort he needs to reach.
At first she had some uncomfortable news for her grandfather: [[Not
many]{.underline}]{.mark} in her generation [[thought]{.mark} much
[about the issue]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[The more I learned from him
about nuclear weapons the more concerned I was that my generation had
this massive and dangerous blind spot in our understanding of the
world," she said in an interview. "Nuclear weapons are the biggest
public health issue I can think of]{.underline}." But she has not lost
hope that their efforts can make a difference, and today she has put her
graduate studies in public health on hold to work full time for the
Perry Project as its social media and web manager. "[It can be easy to
get discouraged about being able to do anything to change our course,"
she said. "But the good news is that nuclear weapons are actually
something that we as humans can control\...but [first we need to start
the conversation]{.mark}.]{.underline}" It was with her help that Perry
went on Reddit to field questions ranging from how his PhD in
mathematics prepared him to what young people need to understand. "As a
90s baby I never lived in the Cold War era," wrote one participant, with
the Reddit username BobinForApples. "What is one thing today\'s
generations will never understand about life during the Cold War?"
Perry's answered, as SecDef19: "Because you were [born in the
1990s]{.underline}, you did not experience the daily terror of 'duck and
cover' drills as my children did. Therefore [[the appropriate fear of
nuclear weapons is not part of your heritage, but the danger is]{.mark}
just as [real]{.mark} now as it was then. It will be up to your
generation to develop the policies to deal with the deadly nuclear
legacy that is still very much with us.]{.underline}" For the former
defense secretary, the task now is to finally---belatedly---prove
Einstein wrong. The physicist said in 1946: "The unleashed power of the
atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking and we thus drift
toward unparalleled catastrophe." In Perry's view **[[the only way to
avoid it is by directly contemplating
catastrophe]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and doing so face to face with the
world's largest nuclear power, Russia, as he recently did in a forum in
Luxembourg with several like-minded Russians he says are brave enough to
speak out about nuclear dangers in the era of Putin. "[We could solve
it," he said. "When you're a prophet of doom, what keeps you going is
not just prophesizing doom but saying there are things we do to avoid
that doom. That's where the optimism is."]{.underline}

### AT: L -- Russia

#### Securitization theory does NOT explain Russia

/GoGreen!

The main theoretical underpinning of this thesis is, as mentioned
before, that of securitisation. 13 The interesting point about this
theory as explained by Wæver and others, is that takes a post-modern
approach to security. Primarily that a discourse about security can
enforce a reality. To specify this to Russian foreign policy, when NATO
is seen as the primary adversary, every action by the alliance, such
stationing military units Eastern Europe to reassure allies and deter
possible military actions, can be viewed as a threat to Russian security
concerns. Or as Sergey Karaganov, head of the Council on Foreign and
Defense Policy, puts it in an interview with Der Spiegel, 'Now, fears in
countries like Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are to be allayed by NATO
stationing weapons there. But that doesn\'t help them; we interpret that
as a provocation. In a crisis, we will destroy exactly these weapons.
Russia will never again fight on its own territory...'14 It must be
stressed though that this securitisation debate in this case is not sole
a Russian purview. [In response to Russian actions taken in Ukraine, and
the several large military exercises in the Russian Western Military
District, a securitisation debate is taking place in the West. One
outcome of this debate were the NATO Summits of 2014, and 2016 which
were explicitly concerned with coming up with a response to Russian
military aggression.15 Therein lies also [a **weakness for**]{.mark}
**the [securitisation theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If two narratives
are put beside each other, and are then argued to be a discourse, then
we might arguably [[state a **false equivalency** about the two
narratives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [While the Russian narrative in regard
to the West, is arguably a constructed view of the world, [Western
concerns about Russian behaviour are]{.mark} arguably [**justified** and
**a response to Russian aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other
words, [we **[must discern fact from bullshit]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
Harry Frankfurt put in his article On Bullshit.16 [While it can be
argued that the current security situation is a construct, this
construct has implications in the real world]{.underline}. How did this
construct came into being? It can be argued that President Putin's
notion that the collapse of the Soviet as one of the greatest
geopolitical disasters of the twentieth century is not without merit.17
If we view the collapse of the Soviet Union as a collapse of an imperial
power, Putin's argument is understandable. Decolonisation can be a
traumatic experience, for both the coloniser, and the colonised. The
example of how France fought two destructive wars in Algeria and
Indochina reminds us, shows that this can be the case. [However, how
both parties interact with one another after the dust has settled can do
much to normalise relations between the two]{.underline}. For much of
the past twenty-six years, it seemed that new geopolitical situation in
Central and Eastern Europe was a fait accompli. Which was reinforced by
several treaties signed in the first decade after the collapse of the
Soviet Union. Treaties like the Budapest Memorandum18 and the
NATO-Russia Founding Act19 in 1994, and 1997 respectively. Even the
advent of President Putin as prime minister, and later as president,
gave no indication of major shifts in Russian foreign policy behaviour.
While there were tensions in the way NATO resolved the several Balkan
conflicts, one would have to be clairvoyant, or extremely pessimistic to
predict the current security situation in Europe. [Yet, in 2008
[with]{.mark} the five-day [war against **Georgia**]{.mark}, and the
annexation of [**Crimea** and]{.mark} starting a war in
**[Donbas]{.mark}** in 2014, Western governments were confronted by a
Russia, willing to bare its teeth to gain a geopolitical
advantage]{.underline}. The timing of these actions are arguably well
planned. [Russia, having invested heavily in upgrading its armed forces,
giving it a comparative advantage militarily]{.underline}. This
development caught European governments on a vulnerable moment, which
issued condemnatory declarations, but lacked substantial tools, save
economic sanctions, to give teeth to those condemnations. Due to
systemic defence budget cuts in the past twentysix years. [[Undeterred,
**Russian sabre rattling has continued** unabated]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[The risk of **nuclear weapons use** in the Euro-Atlantic]{.underline}
region [is on the rise]{.underline}---[and it is higher than it has
**ever been** since the end of the Cold War]{.underline}. This is [the
conclusion of leading security **experts** from the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [**Russia**, and
**Europe**]{.underline} who responded to a questionnaire from the
Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) in early 2015.1 While the experts
disagreed on the scale of the increase in risk and the reasons for the
change, [nearly **all shared the view** that the significant
deterioration in relations between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the Russian Federation has led to **dangerous
conditions** under which **nuclear weapons use** has become **more
likely**]{.underline}--- although the probability of this outcome
remains low. This study examined the risk of use of nuclear weapons, not
just the risk of nuclear exchange or nuclear war. In other words, the
study did not exclude the possibility of unilateral nuclear use. Indeed,
[respondents identified the possibility of unilateral nuclear use by
Russia to quell a conflict on its borders as a risk of particular
concern]{.underline}.2 Other possible nuclear-use scenarios identified
by respondents [include a **rapid escalation** due to **miscalculation**
or **accident** (such as a mid-air collision between NATO and Russian
warplanes), an escalatory response to a Russian incursion into the
Baltic States, and a Russian reaction to NATO military intervention in
Crimea or eastern Ukraine]{.underline}. The study did not assess the
relative probabilities of these scenarios. [Of all the risks examined,
it is the risk of miscalculation that is of most concern. Absent a major
incident, the likelihood of **deliberate nuclear exchange** under
current circumstances is **low**. But it is the possibility of a major
transformative event, such as a **mid-air collision** or a **skirmish**
along NATO or Russian **borders**, that is **on the rise**]{.underline}.
[Such an incident involving the world's two largest nuclear powers could
plausibly shift alert postures and lead to a **rapid series of
escalatory measures** precipitated by **miscalculation** and exacerbated
by **mistrust**]{.underline}. The following section describes in detail
the circumstances that have led to a heightened risk of escalation and
possible nuclear use in the Euro-Atlantic region. Risk Factors The
security experts who responded to NTI's questionnaire identified one or
more of the following ten reasons as contributing factors to the
heightened risk: 1. Competing, Irreconcilable Narratives That Drive
Heightened Threat Perceptions 2. A Deficit of Trust 3. Domestic
Political Imperatives 4. Alliance Politics 5. Close Military Encounters
6. Broken Channels of Communication 7. Failing Safeguards to Prevent
Nuclear Use 8. Conventional Force Disparity 9. Reckless Nuclear Saber
Rattling 10. Lack of Nuclear Experience The authors of this paper
provided supplementary research to expand on topics raised in the
responses. 1. Competing, Irreconcilable Narratives That Drive Heightened
Threat Perceptions Moscow and Washington diverge not only in their
interpretations of recent events in Ukraine but also in the basic
narratives that describe their relations during the entire post--Cold
War era.3 The Russian narrative is characterized by a combination of
grievance and resolve. Prominent Russians frequently claim that Western
powers took advantage of Moscow's weakness after the Cold War to shift
NATO borders east and bomb Russia's allies in the Balkans.4 Western
support for Ukraine's European Union association agreement, Western
sanctions against Russia, and Western demonstrations of military support
for allies on Russia's borders (military exercises, supplies of arms)
appear to reinforce this narrative of Russia as victim of Western
bullying. Prominent Russian officials thus argue that they face no
choice but to demonstrate resolve lest they invite further Western
aggression against their most vital national interests.5 The Western
narrative is starkly different. The United States and its NATO allies
view Russia as a revanchist power aggressively attempting to reclaim
influence and territory in neighboring countries that desire a break
from their Soviet legacies.6 Western officials chastise Russia for
employing tactics such as hybrid warfare, manipulation of gas exports,
and other forms of economic and military intimidation to achieve its
political aims.7 They argue that Russia's annexation of Crimea and
support for separatists in eastern Ukraine represent a major break with
the post-war order in Europe, an order that has prioritized respect for
territorial integrity and sovereignty.8 Russia's behavior in Ukraine and
the potential for Russian intervention in the Baltic States necessitate
demonstrations of resolve lest the West invite further Russian
aggression.9 These [competing, irreconcilable narratives breed
heightened threat perceptions, driving a vicious cycle of confrontation
and escalation. **[By themselves]{.mark}**, these **[threat perceptions
would not necessarily lead to nuclear use, but---combined with]{.mark}
the [factors]{.mark} described [below]{.mark}---they [create]{.mark}
dangerous [conditions under which misunderstandings could
escalate]{.mark} to unprecedented levels** of confrontation between the
world's two largest nuclear powers]{.underline}. 2. A Deficit of Trust
[Russians and Americans have returned to Cold War-era levels of
antagonism toward one another. According to a recent Gallup **poll**,
Americans now view Russia as the greatest enemy to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [edging out both North Korea
and Iran]{.underline}.10 The same poll showed that 49 percent of
Americans view Russia as a critical military threat, and [only 24
percent of Americans have a favorable view of Russia. By contrast, 62
percent of Americans held a favorable view of the Soviet Union in
1989]{.underline} (see Figure 1).11 \[ FIGURE 1 OMITTED -- Figure 1.
Americans' Favorable/Unfavorable Ratings of Russia \] [In Russia, the
trust deficit is even worse. According to a recent poll]{.underline}
conducted [by the Levada Center]{.underline}, a Russian public opinion
research organization, [only 15 percent of Russians have a favorable
view of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and 73 percent of
Russians hold an unfavorable view, a figure that nearly [doubled in the
last year]{.underline} (see Figure 2).12 Another poll released in late
June found that [62 percent of Russians believe that Russia's relations
with the West will always be characterized by mistrust]{.underline}.13
\[ FIGURE 2 OMITTED -- Figure 2. Russians' Favorable/Unfavorable Ratings
of the United States \] 3. Domestic Political Imperatives [[With]{.mark}
such [**deep antagonism permeating public opinion**, it becomes **highly
improbable** for]{.mark} elected [officials to support conciliatory
measures]{.mark}. Instead, policy **[hawks]{.mark}** who advocate
resolve and confrontation tend to **[prevail]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
such environments. This is **[[especially]{.mark} true [in
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** where President Vladimir Putin brandishes
a public image as Russia's best guardian against Western bullying.
Indeed, President [Putin's domestic approval ratings have never been
higher]{.underline}. In June, a Levada Center poll revealed that 89
percent of Russians hold a favorable opinion of their
President---Putin's highest approval rating since he succeeded Boris
Yeltsin 15 years ago.14 Considering that Russia's economy continues to
reel from the combination of low oil prices, Western sanctions, and
structural economic problems, Putin's high public approval rating
indicates that the Russian people strongly support his handling of the
Ukrainian crisis and his relations with the West. [Any departure from
the current course would almost certainly come with a heavy political
price for Putin]{.underline}. [In the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [although anti-Russian rhetoric is much less
prevalent, many public officials and political candidates also have
voiced positions favoring resolve over restraint]{.underline}. For
example, General Joseph Dunford, the Obama Administration's nominee for
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in July 2015 told a Congressional
committee that Russia poses the number one threat to the United States
and that he favors sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine. The Islamic State,
by contrast, was fourth on his list of security threats facing the
United States.15 In August, the outgoing U.S. Army Chief of Staff
General Raymond Odierno echoed General Dunford's comments by labeling
Russia "the most dangerous threat" facing the United States today.16 As
the 2016 [[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} presidential election approaches,
[it is [also unlikely]{.mark} that political candidates [will
depart]{.mark} significantly [from]{.mark} this **[anti-Russia
rhetoric]{.mark}** [given]{.mark} how closely it aligns with record-high
public antagonism toward Russia. Such **[domestic political
imperatives]{.mark}**---from public opinion to political posturing---in
Russia and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [create strong
incentives for demonstrations of resolve, diminishing the chances of a
resolution to the current standoff and leading to a high risk of a
continued cycle of confrontation and escalation]{.underline}. 4.
Alliance Politics [[**Alliance politics** also contributes]{.mark} to
the rhetoric of resolve and confrontation]{.underline}.
**[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Eastern European and Baltic [[members
increasingly view Russia as a major threat]{.mark} and]{.underline}
voice concerns that NATO is ill-prepared to fulfill its Article 5
obligation for collective defense.17 Meanwhile, recent public opinion
polls show that most Germans, Italians, and French believe that their
countries should not use military force to defend a NATO ally (see
Figure 3).18 In this context, [NATO publics increasingly view the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the only credible military
opposition to potential Russian aggression against the
Alliance]{.underline} (see Figure 4).19 The [Obama]{.underline}
Administration [is thus faced with both political and policy imperatives
to demonstrate readiness]{.underline} to \[ FIGURE 3 OMITTED -- Figure
3. Many NATO Countries Reluctant to Use Force to Defend Allies \] \[
FIGURE 4 OMITTED -- Figure 4. NATO Countries Believe U.S. Will Come to
Defense of Allies \] fulfill its Article 5 commitments, [creating a
situation that is not conducive to promoting a conciliatory tone in
relations with Russia. This, in turn, exacerbates the risk of further
demonstrations of resolve and increases the chance of
miscalculation]{.underline}. 5. Close Military Encounters [With
**increasing frequency** and **alarming regularity**, Russian warplanes
and warships are coming dangerously close to Western military and
civilian assets, creating heightened risks for accidents that could lead
to further escalation]{.underline}. As described in a recent report by
the European Leadership Network, [these close encounters include **two
near-collisions** between Russian military jets and Swedish commercial
airliners, repeated incidents of Russian fighter jets "**buzzing**" U.S.
warships in the Black Sea, and **incursions** and near-incursions by
Russian military aircraft into NATO airspace during the last 18
months]{.underline}.20 Russia has insisted that [NATO also has engaged
in such behavior]{.underline}, arguing that NATO military exercises
close to Russian borders have "destabilizing" effects on the region.21
[In the **absence of routine**]{.underline} military-to-military
**[communications]{.underline}** (a factor described in more detail
later in this paper), [these close encounters and military exercises
create conditions under which dangerous **misunderstandings** and
**accidents** could happen---accidents with the potential to prompt
**rapid escalation**]{.underline}. 6. Broken Channels of Communication
[During the past 18 months, **institutions** designed to promote
dialogue between Western powers and Russia have been **suspended** or
**rendered powerless**]{.underline}. In March 2014, Russia's membership
in the Group of Eight (G8) was revoked and its participation in
G8-linked processes, such as the Global Partnership against the Spread
of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, suspended.22 In April
2014, Russia's representation at the NATO-Russia Council---the mechanism
designed to foster security-related consultation and consensus
building---was limited to the Ambassador-level, practically stripping it
of any meaningful working-level interactions.23 Meanwhile, Russia
withdrew from the Nuclear Security Summit process24 and suspended most
of its nuclear security cooperation with the United States.25
Military-to-military engagement on EuroAtlantic issues between NATO and
Russia, as well as the United States and Russia, has---for all practical
purposes---been terminated. Security confidence-building engagement only
continues in the context of arms control verification, an area that has
also come under considerable strain as Western powers and Russia accuse
each other of Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty
violations.26 [Such **severe curtailment of communications** creates
**little room for confidence-building** and **increases** the
**likelihood** of **misunderstandings** that could lead to
**escalation**]{.underline}.

### AT: L -- Terrorism

#### Their evidence does NOT meet similar epistemological standards AND poststructuralism fails to affect either discourse or practice

**Schmid 9** - Chair in International Relations; the Director of the
Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at St. Andrews
University(Alex, Perspectives on Terrorism, v.3, issue 4, Book Review of
"Critical Terrorism Studies. A new research agenda. by Richard Jackson",
<http://www.terrorismanalysts.com/pt/index.php?option=com_rokzine&view=article&id=96>
\*edited for ableist and gendered language

The editors accuse, in their introduction  "the orthodox field" of
orthodox terrorism studies of functioning "ideologically in the service
of existing power structures", with their academic research.
Furthermore, they claim that orthodox scholars are frequently being used
"to legitimise coercive intervention in the global South...." (p.6). The
present volume is edited by three authors associated with the Centre for
the Study of Radicalisation and Contemporary Political Violence (CSRV)
in the Department of International Politics in Aberystwyth (Wales, UK).
They also happen to be editors of a new Routledge journal "Critical
Studies on Terrorism' . The "critical" refers principally but not
exclusively to the "Frankfurt-via-Welsh School Critical Theory
Perspective". The twelve contributors are not all equally "critical" in
aHabermasian sense. The programmatic introduction of the editors is
followed by two solid chapters from Magnus Ranstorp (former Director of
CSTPV, St. Andrews, and currently Director of the Centre for Asymmetric
Threat Studies at the Swedish National Defence College) and Andrew Silke
(formerly with the UK Home Office and now Field Leader for Criminology
at the University of East London). They both rightfully criticize some
of the past sins and present shortcomings of the field of Terrorism
Studies. One of them approvingly quotes Marc Sageman who observed that
"disagreements among experts are the driving force of the scientific
enterprise". Such [disagreements]{.underline}, however, [exist among
"orthodox" scholars]{.underline} like Sageman and  Hoffman or Pape and
Abrams. In that sense, [the [claim by]{.mark} some [critical theorists
that]{.mark} the field of traditional [Terrorism Studies is
ossified]{.mark} without them, is [**simply is not true**.]{.mark} One
of the problems with many of the adherents of the "critical" school is
that the [focus]{.mark} is almost exclusively [on
the]{.mark}]{.underline} strawman [\[[strawperson]{.mark}\] they set up
to shoot -- ["orthodox"]{.mark} terrorism [discourse rather than]{.mark}
on the **[practitioners]{.mark} of terrorism**. Richard Jackson claims
that "...most of what is accepted as well-founded 'knowledge' in
terrorism studies is, in fact, highly debatable and unstable" (p.74),
[dismissing]{.mark} thereby almost [**four decades of scholarship** as
"based on]{.mark} a series of 'virulent [myths']{.mark}, 'half-truths'
and contested claims...biased towards Western state
priorities]{.underline}" (p.80). For him "terrorism is...a social fact
rather than a brute fact" and "...does not exist outside of the
definitions and practices which seek to enclose it, including those of
the terrorism studies field" (pp.75-76). He objects to prevailing
"problem-solving theories of terrorism" in favour of an approach that
questions " the status quo and the dominant acts within it" (p.77).
[Another contributor, J.A. Sluka, argues, without offering any proof, 
that "terrorism is fundamentally a product of social inequality and
state politics" (p. 139). Behind many of the critical theorists who
blame mainstream terrorism research for taking 'the world as it finds
it' there is an agenda for changing the status quo and overthrowing
existing power structures. There is, in itself, nothing wrong with
wanting [a]{.mark} new and [better world]{.mark} order. However, it [is
**not going to be achieved by using an alternative discourse on
terrorism**]{.mark} and counter-terrorism]{.underline}. Toros and
Gunning, contributors of another chapter, state that "the sine qua non
of Critical Theory is emancipation" (p. 99) and M. McDonald als puts
"emancipation as central to the study of terrorism" (p.121). However,
there is not a single word on the non-emancipated position of women
under Islam in general or among the Taliban and their friends from
al-Qaeda in particular. [One of the strength (some argue weakness) of
Western thinking is its ability for **self-criticism**]{.underline} --
something largely absent in the Muslim world. In that sense, this volume
falls within a Western tradition. However, self-criticism should not
come at the cost of not criticising   adversaries by using the same
yardstick. In this sense, this volume is strangely silent about the
worldview of those terrorists who have no self-doubts and attack the Red
Cross,  the United Nations, NGOs and their fellow Muslims with equal
lack of scruples. [A number of authors in the volume appear to equate
terrorism uncritically with political violence in general while in fact
it is more usefully thought of as one of some twenty sub-categories of 
political violence - one characterized by deliberate attacks on
civilians and non-combatants in order to intimidate, coerce or otherwise
manipulate  various audiences and parties to a conflict.]{.underline}
Part of the volume advocates reinventing the wheel. J. Gunning, for
instance, recommends to employ Social Movement Theory for the study of
terrorism. However, that theory has been employed already explicitly or
implicitly by a number of more orthodox scholars, e.g. Donatella della
Porta. [[Many "critical"]{.mark} [statements]{.mark} in the volume [are
**unsupported by convincing evidence**]{.mark}]{.underline}, e.g. when
C. Sylvester and S. Parashar state "The September 11 attacks and the
ongoing war on terror reinforce gender hierarchy and power in
international relations" (p.190). [Jackson claims that the key question 
for critical terrorism theory is "who is terrorism research for and how
does terrorism knowledge support particular interests?" (p.224) It does
not seem to occur to him that **he [could have studied]{.mark} this
question by looking at** the practitioners of terrorism and study
**[al-Qaeda's]{.mark}** ideological **[writings and its
training]{.mark}**  and  recruiting **[manuals]{.mark}**. If CTS is a
call for "making a commitment to emancipatory praxis central to the
research enterprise" (R. Jackson et al, p. 228), CTS academics should be
the first on the barricades against jihadists who treat women not as
equals and who would, if they get their way, eradicate freedom of
thought and religion for all mankind. It is sad that some leading
proponents of Critical Terrorism Studies appear to be in fact
**uncritical**]{.underline} and ~~blind on one eye~~.
