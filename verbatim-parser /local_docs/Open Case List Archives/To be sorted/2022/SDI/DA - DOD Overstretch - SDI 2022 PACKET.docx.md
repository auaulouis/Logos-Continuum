[**Evaluating the effectiveness of security cooperation** in a
systematic and rigorous way]{.underline}, however, [is
**challenging**]{.underline}, particularly at the Army Service Component
Command (ASCC) and Headquarters, Department of the Army (HQDA) levels.
[First, while security cooperation activities tend to be short term and
specific, the **strategic theater objectives** that security cooperation
activities are designed to accomplish are often **long term and not well
defined**]{.underline}. [Second, the **causal relationships** that link
security cooperation activities to desired outcomes are often **not well
understood**]{.underline}. [Finally, **collecting information** relevant
for evaluating security cooperation effectiveness can be
**difficult**]{.underline}. Although all Army security cooperation
activities should be assessed through objective and rigorous
after-action reporting and all security cooperation tasks should be
evaluated through measures of performance and measures of effectiveness,
current Army security cooperation is constrained by poor collection of
relevant information.

Regardless of the difficulties inherent in evaluating security
cooperation activities, the Army and, more broadly, the Department of
Defense [(DoD) are facing congressional pressure for increased
accountability. In response, the DoD is developing an assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) policy for its security cooperation
enterprise]{.underline}. In the DoD's AM&E construct, [**assessment**
refers to baseline assessments for leaders and planners that address
questions like these: What is the security environment in which these
activities will take place? What are the partner's existing
capabilities, and what does the United States want to improve? How well
aligned are the partner's interests and values with those of the United
States?]{.underline} [**Monitoring** means tracking efforts to determine
whether inputs (e.g., money and effort) are translating into outputs
(e.g., equipment, training, education, and information). These outputs
then serve as the basis for tracking progress toward objectives (i.e.,
outcomes)]{.underline}. [**Evaluation** examines outcomes and is crucial
to understanding what is working and what is not. Success is not
ultimately measured by the provision of equipment or training; it is
measured by the extent to which security cooperation activities help
achieve U.S. objectives. Investments require following up to make sure
that they yield the full potential benefits that were
expected]{.underline}.1 This study provides a framework and a tool to
help the Army improve its

security cooperation AM&E capabilities in line with emerging DoD
guidance.

The Pentagon's efforts

In an interview with Defense News, the [assistant secretary of defense
for strategy, plans and capabilities, Mara Karlin, said the [Pentagon
is]{.mark}]{.underline} already [undertaking significant organizational
reforms aimed at better coordinating and **[scrutinizing security
assistance]{.mark}** programs]{.underline}.

The changes, spearheaded by Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Colin
Kahl and executed in December, [moved the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency]{.underline} ― which manages foreign military sales as well as
international military education and training ― under Karlin's office.
What had been [the DoD's security cooperation programs were
combined]{.underline} with elements of the Office of Stability and
Humanitarian Affairs.

"Hopefully that [helps]{.underline} us [take a more strategic approach
to security cooperation more broadly]{.underline}," Karlin said several
weeks after she and Lewis testified together before the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.

[As required by the 2017 defense authorization act, the **Pentagon is
critically reviewing its own efforts**]{.underline}, Karlin said, noting
[**[several studies are underway]{.mark}** to evaluate whether its
security assistance programs were successful.]{.underline}

"The U.S. military, has worked with partner militaries quite robustly
since World War II in particular," she said. "There was a bit of a sea
change in the post-9/11 era, and I think that now as we move forward
into a different era, we see the urgent need to look at how and in what
ways we're achieving our goals."

Beyond the 2022 defense policy bill's mandate for a commission to study
U.S. involvement in Afghanistan from 2001 to 2021, the Pentagon is
contracting with an outside agency for a comprehensive assessment of the
strategic and operational lessons collected from the war there, Karlin
said.

It has other efforts afoot to find and disseminate the lessons from its
security cooperation efforts.

["We're [developing a]{.mark} learning and **[evaluation
agenda]{.mark}** for partnerships that focus on evidence-based
policymaking, which [will]{.mark} include the most critical learning
questions for security cooperation, and **[prioritize]{.mark}** a range
of **[ev]{.mark}idence-[building activities]{.mark}**[, including
**evaluations**]{.mark}, **[monitoring]{.mark}**, **research
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} and tabletop exercises," [Karlin
said]{.underline}. ["These are hard issues to figure out, and you need
[to make]{.mark} some kind of [a **quantitative** and **qualitative**
approach]{.mark}."]{.underline}

For example, the DoD made public a seven-page internal study of U.S.
Africa Command's maritime security cooperation activities in the Gulf of
Guinea from 2007 to 2018. It found those efforts managed to spur Ghana
and Senegal to an increased interest in policing their waters. But on
the flip side, maintenance and parts issues plagued the effort, which
included riverine patrols and offshore interdiction of illegal fishing
and human trafficking.

The [[**proliferation** of]{.mark} complicated [**authorities**
has]{.mark} led to a number of [**pernicious effects** in **DoD's
SC**]{.mark} enterprise]{.underline}. Two deserve mention here. First,
[authorities and related [programs **require that staff** in]{.mark} DoD
stakeholder organizations---particularly the [**CCMDs**, **OSD**,
and]{.mark} the [**agencies**---**are available** to plan]{.mark} their
use and develop initiatives or events, shepherd them through the myriad
justification and approval processes, and manage and report on their
execution. **[The greater the number of authorities]{.mark}** required
to achieve stakeholder objectives, **[the larger the staff
required]{.mark}** to properly manage them. **[But at the same
time]{.mark}, the catalog of authorities has expanded, while [budget
cuts have required staff contraction]{.mark}** across DoD. This **leaves
stakeholders with "[too many programs...and not enough people to
execute]{.mark}"** because "we are losing people who manage the
programs."]{.underline}28 While OSD has at times sought to hone a
reach-back capacity to provide advice to the CCMDs, the expanding
catalog of authorities still requires a larger staff to properly manage
them. [This [**forces** SC personnel to **consider**]{.mark} **the
[cost-benefit]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} doing some events with multiple
funding sources given [the]{.mark}]{.underline} man-[**hours** and
[**workload** required]{.mark} to manage use of separate authorities,
**[whereby "small programs aren't worth the
time]{.mark}**."]{.underline}29 [This also [leads to programs]{.mark}
that are **[not executable in the field]{.mark}**]{.underline}.30

Ensuring Return on Investment

[Pooling resources and sharing responsibility with partner forces is a
**[critical]{.mark}** aspect of U.S. efforts [to **best strategic
competitors**]{.mark}]{.underline} as described within the NDS.
[However, [**despite billions** of]{.mark} dollars' worth of grant-based
**[security assistance]{.mark}** to its allies and
partners]{.underline}---with another \$3.4 billion approved for FY
2019---[the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has yet to
see the proportionate returns from its investment in foreign countries'
security capabilities. In several areas, U.S. **[partners are not yet
ready]{.mark}** to shoulder the burdens that the U.S. administration
seeks of them [with **gaps** in **professionalization**,
**modernization**, and **interoperability**]{.mark} with U.S. forces.
**[Growing]{.mark}** assessment, monitoring, and evaluation
(**[AM&E]{.mark}**) **[standards]{.mark}** and mechanisms to enable the
U.S. government to track how its investments are being utilized and to
what extent shared U.S. and partner goals are being
achieved]{.underline}, as mandated by the FY 2017 and 2018 National
Defense Authorization Acts, **[[will help]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[**[However]{.mark}**, the **[lack of]{.mark} high-level [policy
prioritization]{.mark}** for these tasks, [**exacerbated** by]{.mark}
**staff [capacity]{.mark}** [and **workforce shortfalls**]{.mark}, have
[resulted in]{.mark} some **useful steps forward but [slow
progress]{.mark}** overall]{.underline}.

The U.S. government should consider approaching security cooperation
from a return-on-investment lens, articulating and implementing clear
and practical AM&E standards, benchmarks, corrective measures, and
results in support of strategic objectives. [[**Better AM&E** could
**pave the way** for]{.mark} a greater return on investment and
therefore result in [**reliable, capable partnerships** that
provide]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[[an **edge** over]{.mark} its **[strategic
competitors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Conclusion

[Security cooperation is not a strategy unto itself but is clearly a
critical way to achieve strategic aims]{.underline}. The U.S. government
should pursue security cooperation with a clear-eyed assessment of the
risks and tradeoffs for the sake of "improving a relationship," weighed
against operational, economic, and humanitarian considerations. [With
growing impulses to burden-shift global security requirements onto
allies and partners, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [will **[have to resist temptations to rush
into s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation** commitments. It will
**[have to build policy frameworks]{.mark}** and technical approaches
that are [**both rigorous and responsive** to]{.mark} enable it to
**[compete]{.mark}** and secure its objectives in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}.

#### [Failure]{.underline} is [existential]{.underline} -- [integrated deterrence]{.underline} is key -- NOT any [one tech]{.underline}

As the Pentagon readies its new National Defense Strategy, [the
**commentariat**---unsurprisingly---has]{.underline} some
t[houghts]{.underline}. While the perspectives are, no doubt, as varied
as the array of think tanks and universities from which they spring,
there seems to be [a significant **piling on** against both the **"Great
Power Competition"**]{.underline} that animated Trump-era guidance
[and]{.underline} the (allegedly distinct) [**"Strategic Competition"**
terminology advanced by the Biden administration]{.underline}. [But
"competition" is a rare instance of bipartisan continuity because it
**speaks to real and important dynamics** in the international
system]{.underline}, and it has led to important new thinking in our
approach to national security. [We should not be so quick to discard
it]{.underline}.

[Rather than **abandoning competition**, **[it is time]{.mark} now [to
double down]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Pentagon strategy [should
[embrace]{.mark}]{.underline} a robust concept of **[[integrated
deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the White House should lead with
a National Security Strategy (NSS) [rooted in [a **holistic approach**
to **Competitive Statecraft**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [critics are right that]{.underline} Great Power Competition
(**["GPC"]{.underline}**) [has become a vacuous catch-all, a **magic
word**]{.underline}, as CNAS's Wasser and Pettyjohn tell it, [that can
justify "every force, capability, or resource request." But]{.underline}
that's a perennial bureaucratic tendency; [the same was true of CT and
then COIN]{.underline} in the Bush and Obama years, [and]{.underline}
probably [any number of **terms du jour** in prior eras]{.underline}. We
should always work to minimize these abuses, but we won\'t eliminate
them as long as we use words to describe our priorities. Other
[**critiques** are **less valid** and far **less helpful**]{.underline}.

[The idea that an emphasis on **competition precludes** the possibility
of **cooperation** is an **unhelpful reductio ad
absurdum**]{.underline}. [Pundits may not be able to sustain two
competing ideas at once, but the international system always does, and
the military clearly can: emerging U.S. doctrine envisions a
**competition continuum**]{.underline}, in which "the joint force...
campaigns through a mixture of cooperation, competition below armed
conflict, and armed conflict calculated to achieve the desired strategic
objectives." As Daniel H. Nexon points out, "[**Even during the Cold
War**, the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet
Union worked out a variety of formal and informal rules that helped them
**manage competition**, limit **nuclear prolif**eration, and otherwise
**structure international relations**]{.underline}." ([It is **unclear**
how **Nexon** intends this observation to **support** his **argument
against competition**]{.underline}.)

[Equally **unhelpful** is the common **complaint** that the phrase
"'strategic competition' reflects **uncertainty** about **what that
competition is over** and **what it means to win**]{.underline}." Here
again, [while it might stymie the pundits]{.underline}, this
intellectual hurdle [seems not to have tripped up our military
leaders]{.underline}---they have been consistent in [identifying [the
**stakes** of this **competition**]{.mark} as [the "**rules-based
international order** that brought **prosperity** and **relative peace**
for]{.mark} the last **[seven decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}."

[And "**what it means to win**" is just the **wrong question**---that's
the **whole point**]{.underline}. Echoing George Kennan (\"[We have been
**handicapped** ... by]{.underline} a popular [**attachment to** the
concept of a **basic difference between peace and
war**]{.underline}...\"), the **[competition]{.underline}** discussion
[is enabling the military to finally]{.underline}---against all
odds---[**shed the idea of war as a finite game** that starts with an
opening salvo of munitions and ends with a ceasefire and a treaty. The
fixation on "winning" breeds **fatal short-termism**]{.underline}---see
the common refrain that we didn\'t fight a twenty-year war in
Afghanistan, but rather twenty one-year wars.

What all these simplistic critiques miss is the simple old truth that
the enemy gets a vote. [**Nexon** wants us to **consider competition as
a means rather than an end**. **But it's neither**---it's just **a plain
fact of our strategic environment**, and the last round of guidance
intended to highlight it as **the most salient one for U.S.
strategy**]{.underline}. [It may or may not have been true, but we
[operated for]{.mark} much of the last [thirty years as though]{.mark}
we did not have any real [competitors]{.mark}, ideologically or
materially]{.underline}. The "end of history" trope after the Cold War
was premised on the absence of an ideological alternative to liberal
democracy; and if 9-11 proved that wrong, [the "asymmetric" modifier we
appended to the "warfare" of the Global War on Terror reassured us
that]{.underline} proponents of radical Islam [[lacked the **resources**
to make]{.mark} their vision [an **existential
threat**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[But the]{.mark} long-term ascendency of]{.underline} liberal,
democratic ideals and [**[rules-based]{.mark} international
[order]{.mark}** [is **neither inevitable** **nor
irreversible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There are
**[alternatives]{.mark}** on offer, and they are **actively [being
pursued]{.mark}** [by **adversaries** whose **capabilities** **across
many domains** threaten to **eclipse our own**]{.mark}]{.underline} in
the not-so-distant future. These are the facts, and they demand our
attention. The last NSS and NDS were right to frame them that way.

[We **[must prevent]{.mark}** the **[loss of]{.mark} our [competitive
advantage]{.mark}** [and **deterrent capacity** in **conventional** and
**nuclear war**]{.mark}**fare**---competition should not prevent that;
properly conceived, competition demands it]{.underline}. (The Pentagon
understands this, too.) But the most pernicious element of these
arguments against competition is the insinuation---or the outright
assertion---that we can or should focus on high-end capabilities to the
exclusion of all else. This requires a willful disregard of everything
we have learned about the gray zone/hybrid
warfare/choose-your-appellation. After all, while our high-end advantage
has eroded, it is not gone. We have so far deterred major conventional
and nuclear war, but our adversaries---especially those near-peer "great
powers"---have found countless ways to improve their strategic position
and degrade ours without triggering a conventional military response.
High-end deterrence is necessary, but it's clearly not sufficient. [The
**[accumulation of minor setbacks]{.mark}** can be
**[existential]{.mark}**, [not just]{.mark} because of their obvious and
[**immediate effects**, but]{.mark} because they can
**[degrade]{.mark}** our long-term [ability to]{.mark} generate and
**[project]{.mark} conventional [power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For all its emphasis on GPC, the last NDS [recognized the interrelated
nature of threats at all points on the competition
continuum]{.underline}. This was made especially clear in the Irregular
Warfare Annex: "State adversaries and their proxies increasingly seek to
prevail through their own use of irregular warfare, \[suggesting\] the
need for a revised understanding of IW to account for its role as a
component of great power competition."

[What [we need]{.mark} is **not** a **narrower concept of deterrence**
but a **broader** one that [focus]{.mark}es [**not just** on the
**future conflict** we **could lose** but]{.mark} also [on the **ongoing
competition** we are **currently losing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps
[this is where]{.underline} Secretary Austin's nascent ["**[integrated
deterrence]{.mark}**"]{.underline} idea [is headed.]{.underline} He
seems to want [to **integrate [across domains]{.mark}** and
**tech**nologie**s** and **[with allies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and who
could argue? Well, lots of people, including Representative Mike
Gallagher (R, WI), who has apparently been reading his Pettyjohn: "What
we actually need to integrate is more conventional hard power---more
ships, more long-range missiles and more long-range bombers in the
Indo-Pacific."

Gallagher here is giving voice to [a perpetual **false
choice**]{.underline} we frame [between **conventional** and
**irregular** capabilities]{.underline}. But as the IW Annex said,
[competing in the contested space "**[does not require significant new
resources]{.mark}**... it [requires]{.mark} new ideas and **[new means
of employing existing capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}." The limiting
factor is not in our pocketbooks, it's between our ears. Educating for
IW may not lead to great photo-ops, but it could lead to better outcomes
below the threshold of major war, which would be worth a great deal
more. Unfortunately, after our inglorious exit from Afghanistan, it
seems we are determined to repeat what the Annex called "the 'boom and
bust' cycle that has left the United States underprepared for irregular
warfare in both Great Power Competition and conflict."

Some Congressional leaders are pushing back. Last year\'s NDAA included
authorization to establish a DOD center for studying irregular warfare.
This year\'s bill is still in draft, but both chambers have provisions
demanding an implementation plan for the IW Annex, and the House bill
would require a report on the establishment of the center. Educating for
IW may not lead to great photo-ops, but it could lead to better outcomes
below the threshold of major war, which would be worth a great deal
more.

With all due respect to Secretary Austin, [an **integrated deterrence**
worth its name would be integrated **both** vertically and horizontally.
**Vertically**, it would supplement our **nuclear** and **conventional**
**deterrence** with **unconventional** deterrence to provide creative
and seamless response **options other than "do nothing" and "all-out
war**." **Horizontally**, along **with allies** and partners, it would
**integrate military force** with the **other instruments** of U.S.
national power]{.underline}.

in a broader geostrategic, technological and political context that
shapes the ability of alliances to adapt to a new security environment.
While the challenge of great power competition is acute at both ends of
Eurasia, adversary threats, geography and the institutional context of
US alliances differ. This volume brings together contributors from
Europe, North-East Asia, the United States and Australia to better
understand these challenges, identify commonalities and differences
across regions, and pinpoint ways to collectively manage nuclear
deterrence in twenty-first century alliances. It focuses on nuclear
deterrence in the Indo-Pacific and strategic competition between the US
and China; the role of non-nuclear US allies in the Indo-Pacific and
Europe in supporting US extended nuclear deterrence; political-military
challenges in alliance plans for escalation; allied perspectives on the
consequences of new non-nuclear capabilities, including cyber and
hypersonic weapons, for deterrence and strategic stability; and lessons
on how the US and allied nations can better engage their respective
publics on questions relating to nuclear deterrence.

Alliances, Escalation and Nuclear Weapons

[How to manage escalation is [an **inherently political
question**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The costs and benefits of support in
case of attack and of achieving security against specific challenges
will differ between allies. The credibility of extended deterrence
threats rests on the commitment of certain allies, especially the US, to
provide security to other allies who find themselves under more
immediate threat. [[The **asymmetric nature** of]{.mark} an **[extended
deterrence]{.mark}** relationship thus [creates **anxieties of
abandonment**]{.mark} on the part of the threatened ally [and **fears of
entrapment**]{.mark} by all allies in conflicts in which they have
little direct stake. [For **deterrence** to be effective]{.mark}, allies
nonetheless [have to find ways to]{.mark} agree and **[credibly
commit]{.mark}** to what they are willing to do for each
other]{.underline}.

Nowhere is this more important than in relation to the role of US
nuclear weapons in America's alliances. While some US allies have
previously expressed sympathy for the Treaty on the Prohibition of
Nuclear Weapons (TPNW), none today is willing to sign it, as their
[[**focus** has turned to]{.mark} the challenge of [**managing
escalation** in]{.mark} potential **[great power conflicts]{.mark}** in
**Europe** and the **Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}. [Moscow's penchant for
**nuclear sabre-rattling** in crises with **NATO** and
**[Ukraine]{.mark}**, **[Beijing's]{.mark}** ambitious **nuclear force
[modernisation]{.mark}**, **[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea['s]{.mark} development of a thermonuclear and
intercontinental range **[arsenal]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} the
development of new capabilities--- including **[hypersonic
missiles]{.mark}** designed to confer escalation advantage over the US
and its allies in regional conflicts---[have all **roused nuclear
strategy** from]{.mark} its **post--Cold War
[hibernation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From 2011, the Obama administration
established extended deterrence dialogues with North-East Asian treaty
allies, Japan and South Korea, in response to growing concerns about
North Korea and China. Since 2014, the NATO alliance has paid far
greater institutional and political attention to the strategic role of
its nuclear forces, and to the possibilities of escalation more
generally after the end of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty. Under the Trump administration, US nuclear policy was notable
for how little controversy it attracted among US allies, despite the
administration's decision to introduce the first new (low-yield) warhead
variants since the end of the Cold War.

However, the existential dependence of US allies on decisions taken in
Washington about US nuclear strategy has been a constant element in the
history of US alliances, and key to grasping their inherent tensions:
from US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's challenge to NATO's
nuclear strategy of massive retaliation in the early 1960s, to concerns
about US-- Soviet arms control undermining the security of Western
Europe in the 1970s and the late 1980s, to President Obama's declared
commitment to reducing the role of nuclear weapons in US defence posture
in the face of rising nuclear threats to North-East Asian allies.
Throughout the Cold War, arguments about nuclear strategy were staple
fare for official and academic debates, especially regarding the role of
nuclear weapons in deterrence. How to interpret and implement the
concept of flexible response after its adoption in 1967 was the subject
of often acrimonious debate in NATO, as allies sought to balance fears
of abandonment, entrapment and a Soviet Union that threatened them all,
but in different ways depending on their geographical position. In Asia,
forward-based US nuclear forces on the Korean Peninsula were a central
element in deterring North Korea until their withdrawal in 1992, and
Japan carefully balanced its public aversion to nuclear weapons with
practical support for the operation of US nuclear forces as a deterrent
against the Soviet Union and China. In Australia, the role of the 'joint
facilities' in US nuclear operations was a central element of the
alliance in the second half of the Cold War.

Managing Escalation in the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic Areas

At the 2021 Munich Security Conference, President Biden declared that
'America is back', and that 'the United States is determined ... to earn
back our position of trusted leadership'.2 [However, while it is clear
that public division and disagreement among allies about how to manage
escalation and deter threats are undesirable, [the **US** and its
**allies** **still have a long way to go**]{.mark} in either the
**Indo-Pacific** or the **Euro-Atlantic** areas [to develop
**viable**]{.mark} and commonly accepted [**political-military
strategies** for]{.mark} the new era of **[great power
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3 Significant differences remain
between the challenges of escalation at either end of Eurasia, but [the
basic problem--- how US allies can achieve political agreement on
credible threats of military escalation, including through the use of
nuclear weapons, to deter attacks by nuclear-armed powers---remains the
same]{.underline}. [Hence, the **value** of exchanging ideas between the
Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic areas is also **far greater** than it has
been in the **past**]{.underline}.

In the 1980s, a US official reportedly observed that exchanges between
NATO and Japan throughout the INF negotiations had 'taught the Japanese
to speak German'.4 The Reagan administration's decision to abrogate US
obligations towards ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, United States
Security Treaty) ally New Zealand was also in large part motivated by
sending signals to Washington's Scandinavian allies, some of whom at the
time were flirting with anti-nuclear initiatives.5 However, the
institutional and geostrategic context of US alliances in Europe and the
Asia-Pacific was sharply different during the Cold War, as was their
manner of engagement on questions of escalation and nuclear strategy.
Today, these differences are far less pronounced, and [the **US**, its
**Indo-Pacific allies** and **NATO** [are **rediscovering** the
**political-military challenges** of **escalation management** **at the
same time**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the context of China's rise, North
Korea's nuclear tests and the US retirement of its nuclear-armed,
submarine-launched cruise missiles in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review,
**Japan** and **So**uth **Ko**rea **[pressed]{.mark} US officials [for
'more]{.mark} NATO-like' extended deterrence
arrangements**]{.underline}.6 NATO allies, for their part, increasingly
recognise the relevance for their alliance of a possible conflict with
China.7 For several years, NATO's institutional architecture has been
explicitly drawn on by Japanese security analysts to support proposals
to strengthen nuclear deterrence and reassurance in the US--Japan
alliance.8 [Even]{.underline} in **[Australia]{.underline}**, former
prime minister Kevin Rudd---whose government in 2008 co-sponsored the
Australian--Japanese International Commission on Nuclear
Non-Proliferation and Disarmament---[joined **calls** in
2021]{.underline} for an 'Asian Nuclear Planning Group' that would allow
the US, Australia, Japan and South Korea ['[to]{.mark} discuss specific
policies associated with US nuclear forces and [**conduct** **war
games** and **exercises**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including those
involving the highest political-level participation'.9

### T/C -- GPC Turns I/Ls

/GoGreen!

First, I want to show how [[**tensions** between **Great
Powers**]{.mark} can [affect **existential risk** **even if** they
**don't lead to direct conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The history of nuclear risk demonstrates this effect. Nuclear weapons
are arguably the greatest threat to the long-term future that humanity
has created so far. While they were invented during World War II, their
proliferation and the invention of new delivery mechanisms such as
submarines and intercontinental ballistic missiles occurred after the
war, amid mutual fear of conflict between the US and Soviet Union.

[**By international tension I mean** something like "a shared worry
about **an imminent conflict \[which\] itself may contribute to starting
a war**"]{.underline}.\[13\]\[14\] There's at least two specific
dynamics worth worrying about if international tension is high in the
21st century.

The first is that [hostilities [will]{.mark} **probably** **[make it
harder]{.mark}** for countries **[to coordinate to mitigate other
risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As a recent example, progress towards a
strong, international treaty governing **[l]{.mark}ethal
[a]{.mark}utonomous [w]{.mark}eapon[s]{.mark}** was]{.underline}
reportedly [stymied by the US and Russia]{.underline}. We might [expect
the effect on risks like future **[pandemics]{.mark}**, **[governance of
new tech]{.mark}**nologies, [or **climate change**]{.mark} to be
similarly negative]{.underline}. However, I'm very uncertain about the
size of this effect. In some ways a more divided world may be even more
resilient to certain risks if it helps avoid correlated policy failures.
The Covid-19 pandemic could have been even worse, for example, if every
country had a policy that was similar to those adopted in a country like
the US.

The second dynamic is that [international tension [could **speed
up**]{.mark} the [development of **dangerous tech**]{.mark}**nologies**
like **military AI**, [new **w**]{.mark}eapons of **[m]{.mark}**ass
**[d]{.mark}**estruction]{.underline}, and other weapons that are hard
to foresee in 2022. Militaristic competition is particularly intense,
paranoid, and aggressive. [[The **more likely they think**]{.mark} a
[**war is**, the **more likely**]{.mark} decision-makers [are to]{.mark}
make large and **[risk]{.mark}**y investments in military technologies
to try to gain an advantage over their rivals]{.underline}.\[15\] Once
these weapons are developed, [they [could be **deployed
unintentionally**, as nearly occurred with **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
weapon[s]{.mark}** [on **several occasions**]{.mark} during the Cold
War]{.underline}.

Again, though, I'm uncertain about the size of the effect. I also think
there is some upside risk. It seems like states will also be more likely
to develop defensive technologies if international tension is high.
These defenses could be helpful in mitigating accidents as well as
purposeful attacks. So if the probability that an accident is avoided
outweighs the probability that an attack is successful, a more tense
world could be a safer one.

For these reasons, I think Great Power relations affect existential risk
even if they do not lead to direct conflict. More international tension
will increase existential risk to the extent that (1) international
tension makes it harder for countries to cooperate and (2) more
cooperation reduces risk. The more likely Great Powers think a war is,
the more they will increase their military budgets and invest in
developing new weapon technologies. But international tension could also
decrease risk. For example, it could increase policy diversity among
countries which could boost resilience. It could also speed up the
development of defensive technologies. I'm very uncertain about the net
effect of these dynamics. I think it would be really helpful to see more
research in this area.

Abstract: Despite the billions of dollars invested in the security
cooperation enterprise each year, the Marine Corps and the Department of
Defense (**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[have **failed** to
**implement** **standardized metrics**]{.mark} and processes
[for]{.mark} evaluating **[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation**
engagements]{.underline} at the tactical level. Without such data, it is
nearly impossible for the security cooperation enterprise to accurately
assess progress in achieving national security objectives, such as
partner nation basing access and partner force capacity building.
[[Without]{.mark} clear [signposts]{.mark} of progress,
**[coop]{.mark}eration** engagements [will continue to be]{.mark}
hampered by [**redundant** or **irrelevant**]{.mark} training that
limits the return on investment for the DOD and strategic U.S.
partners]{.underline}.

Keywords: security cooperation, Marine Corps, Department of Defense,

In the realm of investment banking and equity markets, the term alpha is
used to describe financial performance relative to standard market
returns during a given period of time.1 For investors, the process of
"seeking alpha" requires discipline and careful attention to data and
analytics patterns that can ultimately lead to a greater return on
investment. Similarly, individuals responsible for managing defense
spending should seek to implement standard methodologies and data-based
decision-making processes, particularly in high investment areas like
security cooperation. At times, the [[**focus** on **new
tech**]{.mark}nological developments, [such as **a**]{.mark}rtificial
**[i]{.mark}**ntelligence and 3D printing, [has **distracted**
from]{.mark} the human dimension of conflict and the "[key]{.mark} role
in building partner [capacity]{.mark}"]{.underline} described in the
Marine Corps Operating Concept. 2 [While it is vital to continue
developing disruptive technology for future warfare, it is [**equally
important** to]{.mark} pursue innovation through [improve]{.mark}ment of
existing technology and **[processes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Based on numbers provided by the Office of the Secretary of Defense for
fiscal year 2019, security cooperation activity accounts for at least
\$10 billion in spending---a conservative estimate that does not include
classified programs or drug-interdiction programs authorized under
Section 127e and Section 284c of Title 10 of the U.S.C.3 Each year, the
Department of Defense (DOD) conducts 3,000--4,000 security cooperation
engagements with more than 130 countries.4 Despite the large investment
of money and time in the security cooperation enterprise, the DOD has
failed to implement a standard methodology for evaluating security
cooperation activity at a tactical level. In light of this, the Marine
Corps should implement a standardized, quantifiable, tactical level
security cooperation assessment methodology to accurately measure the
effectiveness of engagements with partner forces.

Security Cooperation Defined

Security Cooperation, Joint Publication (JP) 3-20, provides the
following definition of security cooperation:

> Security cooperation (SC) encompasses all Department of Defense (DOD)
> interactions, programs, and activities with foreign security forces
> (FSF) and their institutions to build relationships that help promote
> U.S. interests; enable partner nations (PNs) to provide the U.S.
> access to territory, infrastructure, information, and resources;
> and/or to build and apply their capacity and capabilities consistent
> with U.S. defense objectives.5

The Fiscal Year (FY) 2019 President's Budget: Security Cooperation
Consolidated Budget Display outlines seven categories of security
cooperation activity, including military-to-military engagements,
support to operations, and humanitarian and assistance activities, among
others.6 The security cooperation framework traditionally includes
security assistance (SA), security force assistance (SFA), and some
aspects of foreign internal defense (FID).7 In the context of this
article, the term security cooperation refers primarily to
military-tomilitary engagements, where the U.S. military engages in
training partner forces under the auspices of Title 10 and Title 22
authorities.

[The important role of **security cooperation** in the future operating
environment **[cannot be overstated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Summary
of the 2018 National Defense Strategy of the United States of America
asserts that enduring military success is contingent upon "building
long-term security partnerships" and upholding "our allies' own webs of
security relationships."8 [[In]{.mark} the current operating environment
marked by [**great power competition**, **s**]{.mark}**ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation** will be a **[vital]{.mark} tool** used [to
preempt **high-end conflict**]{.mark} and assure strategic access to
basing, equipment, and intelligence resources. In short, security
cooperation is [an **indispensable pillar** of]{.mark} U.S. foreign
policy, with the capability to influence **[all instruments of]{.mark}
national [power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Overview of Doctrine and Policies

Though there is much current debate about cost-sharing measures between
the United States and its allies, few national security experts would
object to the importance of security cooperation. However, it is often
difficult to articulate the metrics that define mission success. Perhaps
the problem is best framed with a question: If indeed security
cooperation is important, how does one measure the output from such
activity to shape future planning and funding? This question is only
partially answered by doctrine and directives at the joint and Service
component levels.

Security Cooperation recommends that all combatant commanders should use
an assessment, monitoring, and evaluation framework. However, the
publication mistakenly identifies strategic-level assessments and
evaluations as the only deficiency in security cooperation planning:
"Because SC activities are dispersed and generally support long-term
objectives, the impacts can be difficult to immediately measure above
the tactical and operational levels (i.e., operational assessments and
service or functional component-level evaluations)."9 In January 2017,
the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy published DOD
Instruction 5132.14: Assessment, Monitoring, and Evaluation Policy for
the Security Cooperation Enterprise, which further elaborates on the
assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E) framework. The DOD
instruction outlines the responsibilities of all relevant parties at the
strategic level, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
the geographic combatant commanders, and the functional combatant
commanders. The instruction letter states that the "DoD will maintain a
hybrid approach to management of AM&E efforts, whereby, in general,
assessment and monitoring will be a decentralized effort based on the
principles and guidelines established in this instruction and other
directives, policies, and law."10 In theory, this decentralized approach
to assessments is preferable. The reality, however, is that Service
components have failed to support the Office of the Secretary of
Defense's AM&E framework with focused data inputs.

While the Marine Corps has successfully implemented operational
assessments through the use of security cooperation engagement plans and
capabilities-based assessments, it lacks the necessary tactical
assessments to contribute to the higher-level AM&E structure. In
general, the Marine Corps supports the implementation of assessments for
security cooperation engagements. Marine Corps Order 5710.6C, Marine
Corps Security Cooperation, which governs the conduct of security
cooperation activity, suggests that integrated assessment teams are
vital to an effective long-term strategy. The order also states that the
purpose of assessments is to "provide maximum effectiveness."11 In
addition to the Marine Corps order on security cooperation, Marine Corps
Operations, Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication 1-0, affirms the value of
assessments. According to Marine Corps Operations, assessments not only
provide a "basis for adaptation," but they also serve as a "catalyst for
decision-making."12 Based on this information, it would seem that the
Marine Corps and the joint force have properly identified the need for
security cooperation assessments, which prompts the question: What, if
anything, needs to be changed about the current approach to security
cooperation engagements?

Research Hypothesis

As a former theater security cooperation (TSC) coordinator for
Special-Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force Crisis Response-Africa 17.1
(SPMAGTF-CRAF 17.1), the author was not aware of any method to
accurately measure the performance and effectiveness of security
cooperation missions. After reviewing the after action reports submitted
by previous teams, there was a noticeable scarcity of specific training
data; higher headquarters and the Marine Corps Security Cooperation
Group had not promulgated a standardized, quantifiable, tactical-level
assessment methodology. Although the author's personal experiences
indicate that security cooperation assessments lacked analytical rigor,
additional independent research was used to validate the hypothesis that
the Marine Corps lacked a standardized, quantifiable process for
evaluating security cooperation missions at the tactical level.

Research Process

The research consisted of two parts: first, the author thoroughly
reviewed the seminal doctrinal publications, directives, and policies
relevant to the field of security cooperation to determine if an
assessment methodology existed. This process entailed a complete review
of 16 authoritative documents and articles. Second, the author completed
a data-mining project to evaluate after action reports submitted to the
Marine Corps Center for Lessons Learned (MCCLL). The data mining spanned
six years of SPMAGTF-CR-AF data between 2010 and 2016, excluding 2011.
The author's research included both unit after ac- tion reports and
MCCLL reports for security cooperation missions. The source content for
the second part of the research project consisted of 19 after action
reports, totaling 280 pages of material.

Summary of Findings

The first part of the research project involving the 16 authoritative
source documents yielded no additional information about quantitative
assessment methodologies. The second part of the research project
yielded more instructive results:

> • 32 percent of the documents did not provide a single reference to
> the words "assessment" or "evaluation"
>
> • 68 percent of the documents mentioned the word "assessment" or
> "evaluation" at least once
>
> • 38 percent of the documents that used the words "assessment" or
> "evaluation" used them in the context of developing a training
> schedule or assisting partner nation forces
>
> • 20 percent of the documents explicitly mentioned using training and
> readiness standards as a baseline for evaluating partner nation forces
>
> • None of the after action reports incorporated quantifiable data or a
> standard process for evaluating partner force performance and
> capability

The most salient conclusion from this data is that security cooperation
leaders recognize the importance of assessments and evaluations in
achieving successful outcomes with partner forces. However, the research
also implies that security cooperation leaders have not fully
incorporated quantifiable standards into the evaluation process, as
evidenced by the lack of data and inconsistent assessment methodologies.

Research Conclusions

Despite the myriad references to assessments and evaluations in
doctrine, policies, and mission after action reports, the analysis
confirmed that the Marine Corps had not published or even developed a
standardized, quantifiable, tacticallevel assessment methodology for
security cooperation engagements. Currently, the only feedback received
by operational planners is subjective observations from team leaders and
team chiefs in the form of after action reports. Marine Forces Europe
and Africa (MFEA) headquarters provides limited guidance for developing
the after action reports and quantitative data is not required. Most of
the reports are replete with anecdotal information, where teams bemoan
their lodging conditions or food options, rather than provide specific,
action- able data to inform future engagements and planning. This void
in the feedback loop means that operational and strategic planners are
left without the details necessary to complete their respective
higher-level assessments.

A Proposed Solution: Hybrid Training and Readiness Assessment
Methodology

Galileo Galilei noted that one should always seek to "measure what is
measurable, and make measurable what is not so."13 Based on the
previously mentioned research findings, the security cooperation
enterprise has not succeeded in making security cooperation activities
measurable at the tactical level. In light of this, the Marine Corps
should adopt a hybrid training and readiness assessment methodology for
future security cooperation engagements. The joint force should
replicate this methodology to synchronize assessment efforts across the
DOD.

The Hybrid Training and Readiness Assessment Methodology (hereafter
referred to as the "methodology") was developed and implemented by the
author during a SPMAGTF-CR-AF deployment in 2017 and was used during
subsequent SPMAGTF-CR-AF deployments. The methodology was lauded by the
SPMAGTF-CR-AF commander and reviewed by the Commandant of the Marine
Corps in 2017. Senior staff members from the Center for Army Lessons
Learned have requested to highlight the methodology as a recommended
model for future partner engagements across the Department of the Army.

The methodology is a three-part process consisting of nine individual
steps (figure 1). The three parts are planning, execution, and
transition, which reflect the various stages of a security cooperation
mission. Part one, planning, begins with the security cooperation team
leaders and team chiefs completing steps one through three, which
consist of mission analysis, T&R selection, and period of instruction
development. Part two, execution, encompasses steps four through six
that require an initial assessment, a period of instruction, and a final
assessment. Part three, transition, includes steps seven through nine,
which require TSC teams to compile data from their assessments, analyze
the data, and then disseminate conclusions from the data. The outputs
from part three feed back into part one as new inputs prior to
reinitiating the mission analysis process. Each step of the methodology
consists of several questions that should be answered before proceeding
to the next step. This nine-step iterative process can be adjusted and
tailored to meet the unique demands of each mission.

During part 1, the team leaders and team chiefs are dependent on the
embassy country team and MFEA regional planners to relay the specific
training requests of the host nation. Operational and tactical level
staff must work together to compare Marine Corps T&R standards with the
partner nation training requirements. By using Marine Corps T&R
standards as a baseline **\[FIGURE 1 OMITTED\]** and adjusting the
standards to meet the partner nation objectives, the security
cooperation team employs a hybrid T&R approach, which is used over time
to gauge the progress of the partner nation. During part 2, security
cooperation team leaders will select one of three different assessment
packages to perform the initial and final assessments. The type of
assessment chosen by the team depends on the type of mission.

The first assessment option is a written test, which is preferable for
short missions conducted in a classroom setting. This approach is not
always ideal, because language barriers can inhibit clear test
translation; additionally, some partner nation trainees are averse to
formal testing. A second assessment option is a practical application,
which is ideally suited for longer missions requiring extensive field
skills and infantry tactics training. This assessment model should be
designed similar to the combat endurance test at the Marine Corps
Infantry Officers Course, with separate skills stations and rigorous
physical fitness tests. The benefit of this approach is that it avoids
the appearance of formal testing while providing greater flexibility for
trainers to evaluate the performance of partner nation military
personnel. The disadvantages of this approach are two fold: first, the
practical application assessment introduces more subjectivity into the
evaluation process; and second, it requires additional trainers and
larger training facilities, both of which may not be readily available.

A third assessment option is the combined approach, which incorporates
elements of a written test with a practical application. This approach
is ideally suited for multifaceted security cooperation missions that
require a combination of academic training and field skills. This third
assessment option encourages trainers to generate both quantitative and
qualitative mission data while catering to a wider variety of learning
styles.

Conventional Training and Readiness Evaluation Process

The conventional approach to evaluating partner nation forces is
centered on the Marine Corps Training and Readiness Standards and
Performance Evaluation Checklists (PECLs). PECLs include conditions,
standards, and event components, which are evaluated by trained
instructors. During the author's deployment, the most common PECL used
was a standard infantry patrolling checklist that included 15 event
components (figure 2). During the course of an **\[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\]
\[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\]** evaluation, the trainer first marks "yes" or "no"
next to the "observed" column on the checklist. As each event component
is completed, the evaluator will determine if performance is
"Sufficient" (S) or "Insufficient" (I). After determining the average
score for each of the event components, the trainer assigns a grade of
"untrained," "partially trained," or "trained." Most Marines are
familiar with this evaluation process and are accustomed to using PECLs
as a baseline for monitoring improvement. The problem with implementing
a conventional approach to evaluations is that it ignores the nuances of
host nation training requirements. The conditions, standards, and event
components of traditional PECLs should be adjusted to reflect the
requests of the host nation.

A Hybrid T&R Evaluation Process

Figure 3 represents an example of a hybrid PECL, which replaces event
components 4 and 13 and adds event component 16 (hybrid adjustments are
highlighted gray). The hybrid PECL provides a standardized template that
is adjusted to meet the demands of the partner force.

First Lieutenant Robert Curtis used the methodology during a deployment
with SPMAGTF-CR-AF 18.1. As the logistics combat element TSC
coordinator, he experienced firsthand the utility of employing hybrid
PECLs. According to First Lieutenant Curtis, "Using regular T&R
standards is difficult because the partner nations are not equipped or
organized like the Marine Corps; therefore, our standards do not always
apply to them. Using hybrid T&Rs allows the teams to produce more
focused and relevant assessments for the partner nation."14

Process for Generating Assessment Data

After completing the nine-step methodology, the security cooperation
team will be able to produce valuable quantifiable data that will shape
future engagements. To produce this data, team leaders will need to
complete a simple formula (figure 4). First, the team leader will
compile the results from the initial assessment and compute the average
for each student who was evaluated on a written test, a practical
application test, or a combined test. In the case of the assessment data
provided in figure 4, the average score is 48 percent. The team leader
will then compile the results of the final assessment---ensuring the
same test is used for both the initial and final assessment---and
compute the average of the scores using either a mean or median
calculation model. In the hypothetical illustration below, the final
assessment average is 87 percent. The team leader will then compare the
initial assessment with the final assessment and derive the absolute
value or range of improvement for the mission. In the example provided
in figure 4, the total range of improvement equates to 39 percent.

The data presented in figure 4 is representative of one security
cooperation **\[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\]** mission, so regional planners who
are responsible for multiple missions should collate the assessment data
in a bar chart or bar graph format to depict the range of improvement
across all missions during a given period of time as seen in the data
presented during the SPMAGTF-CR-AF 17.1 TSC missions (figure 5).

Arguments in Support of the Hybrid Training and Readiness Assessment
Methodology

Perhaps the most compelling reason to enact the methodology is to
promote fiscal accountability and responsibility within the Marine Corps
and the DOD. Among the Services, the Marine Corps is known for its
propensity to conserve scarce resources. In the early nineteenth
century, Commandant Archibald Henderson popularized the long-held Marine
Corps mantra of "fighting on the cheap."15 Henderson successfully
lobbied for Marine Corps involvement in the Seminole Wars (1817--18,
1835--42, 1855--58) and the Mexican War (1846--48) largely because he
was able to convince the president that the Marine Corps could
accomplish the mission with fewer resources than the Army.16 A similar
mentality persists in the modern Marine Corps. During a deployment in
2017, Marines with SPMAGTF-CR-AF saved approximately \$700,000 in a
\$3,000,000 operational budget by implementing the aforementioned
assessment methodology. Other Marine Corps units that employed the
methodology during SPMAGTF-CR-AF rotations also garnered considerable
cost savings. The data produced during these deployments equipped senior
leadership with **\[FIGURE 5 OMITTED\]** the information necessary to
eliminate extraneous programs and increase overall efficiency. By
broadly integrating the Hybrid T&R Assessment Methodology into all
partner nation engagements, the Marine Corps will further establish its
reputation as a force that is ruthlessly efficient and frugal.

In addition to promoting fiscal responsibility, [the methodology
will]{.underline} also [enhance planning across the tactical,
operational, and strategic levels of war]{.underline}. In a recent Rand
Corporation study, researchers identified several challenges facing the
DOD as it continues to implement the AM&E framework. One particularly
daunting challenge mentioned in the report is the process of comparing
tactical security cooperation activities with U.S. policy objectives and
determining if the activities have fulfilled the objectives.17 The
authors of the study suggest that "[a standardized \[assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation\] **[AM&E]{.mark}** regimen applied across
activities helps policymakers and implementers make **more informed
decisions** that [**maximize immediate outcomes** and]{.mark} help
[ensure]{.mark} programmatic [**sustainability** and **impact**]{.mark}
in the longer term]{.underline}."18 The report also mentions that
assessments can provide important insight for planners: "If fully
implemented, partner country capability/interoperability assessments
have the potential to provide useful information to security cooperation
planners and programmers who lack domain expertise or Service
perspectives on what is needed from partner militaries."19 [Military
planners are often criticized for their failure to harmonize the
strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war. The methodology
makes progress in achieving a more integrated approach to TSC
planning]{.underline}.

Counterarguments

Despite the many benefits of adopting the methodology, there are also
some drawbacks. One potential problem with the methodology is that it
can create a culture of chasing the data, where security cooperation
teams and partner forces are motivated by test performance at the
expense of genuine teaching and learning. Although this challenge is
worth consideration, it is not enough to overcome the need for
assessments. When properly trained, security cooperation instructors
recognize that assessments are only one aspect of effective education. A
healthy educational culture is established by team leadership, and
trainers must be willing to adjust the format and frequency of the
assessments to prevent unhealthy obsession about data. One method for
reducing the focus on assessments during partner force engagements is to
ensure that the assessment results are anonymous. Reflecting on his time
as a security cooperation team leader in Gabon and Ghana in 2017, First
Lieutenant Brendan Gallahue summarized his approach to testing: "At the
end of the initial assessment, we debriefed the group on how they
performed and explained the average score for the collective unit,
without posting each individual's scores."20 Security cooperation teams
can mitigate an unhealthy assessment culture by promoting groupwide
improvement and retaining close control of assessment results.

Another counterargument is that the Marine Corps lacks the capacity to
fully train security advisors on more complex hybrid T&R standards.
Purveyors of this point of view claim that the predeployment workup
cycle is already limited for the SPMAGTFs and Marine Expeditionary Units
(MEUs), and therefore units will not have the bandwidth to conduct
ancillary security cooperation training. While some hybrid standards may
require additional training, most of the hybrid PECLs include material
that is familiar to conventional Marine Corps units. If more complex
hybrid standards cannot be taught organically by individuals from a
deploying unit, the unit can request individual augments to fill
low-density skill sets. During previous security cooperation
engagements, Marine units have successfully requested support from 2d
Reconnaissance Battalion and 2d Combat Engineer Battalion to provide
specialized skills training.

First Lieutenant Gallahue confirmed the feasibility of training security
cooperation advisors and noted that his team was able to seamlessly
integrate the methodology into their training plan. After his mission,
First Lieutenant Gallahue observed that "using the Hybrid T&R Assessment
Methodology actually made the mission execution a lot simpler than we
anticipated. My team successfully built a training program around an
initial assessment, where we established a baseline and culminated with
a final exercise to measure the progress of our partners and gauge the
effectiveness of the training."21 The methodology is likely to cause
some friction initially, but it will ultimately simplify the efforts of
security cooperation trainers.

Summary

Anecdotal, experiential, and empirical evidence all suggest that the
Marine Corps and DOD support the need for a tactical-level assessment
methodology. [Despite repeated mandates from Congress to account for the
billions of dollars' worth of security cooperation expenditures, only
marginal progress has been achieved]{.underline}. [[At this point, the
**r**]{.mark}eturn **[o]{.mark}**n **[i]{.mark}**nvestment [for the
**s**]{.mark}**ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation [enterprise]{.mark}** [is
**unclear, at best**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Hybrid Training and
Readiness Assessment Methodology is a tool that can radically shift the
investment proposition of the enterprise from one marked by tepid
returns to a position of maximum return. The methodology fills a
critical role in connecting tactical, operational, and strategic
planning while also promoting fiscal responsibility and accountability.
[Sherlock Holmes' famous aphorism summarizes the problem and the
potential solution for what ails security cooperation efforts: "It is a
capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins
to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit
facts]{.underline}."22 Indeed, [by leveraging facts and data, the
security cooperation enterprise will transition from seeking alpha to at
last achieving alpha]{.underline}.

As the Arab world continues to unravel, violence re-escalates in Iraq,
and withdrawal from Afghanistan portends, this appears to be a good time
to consider U.S. security cooperation (SC) policy. Security cooperation
is a cornerstone of U.S. defense strategy, especially as the Department
of Defense looks ahead at attenuated budgets and force structure.
[[Planners **imagine**]{.mark} that **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation** [is a **force multiplier**]{.mark}]{.underline};
a way to do more with less. At face value, it extends U.S. influence and
enables and influences partners to foster and improve security in their
region, forestalling crisis, and replacing U.S. presence with
like-minded regional guardians of the international status quo. [While
the idea makes much sense **[in the abstract]{.mark}**, [once it
collides with the **messy reality** of]{.mark} **military
[institutions]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **domestic [politics]{.mark}** in
the world's most troubled region, it [becomes]{.mark} sometimes
comically, sometimes [**disastrously**, **out of touch**]{.mark} **with
reality**]{.underline}.

Security cooperation is defined in the Security Assistance Management
Manual as,

all activities undertaken by the Department of Defense (DoD) to
encourage and enable international partners to work with the United
States to achieve strategic objectives. It includes all DoD interactions
with foreign defense and security establishments, including all
DoD-administered Security Assistance (SA) programs, that build defense
and security relationships; promote specific U.S. security interests,
including all international armaments cooperation activities and SA
activities; develop allied and friendly military capabilities for
self-defense and multinational operations; and provide U.S. forces with
peacetime and contingency access to host nations. It is DoD policy that
SC is an important tool of national security and foreign policy and is
an integral element of the DoD mission.

[The problem with SC is that it is **[implemented as
if]{.mark}**]{.underline} all of the aforementioned [**[positive results
are a given]{.mark}** in every situation]{.underline}. [**[In
reality]{.mark}**, positive results [are **exceedingly
rare**]{.mark}]{.underline} with the most challenging and troubled
partners---the very situations for which officials desperately hope SC
to work miracles. [[While **officialdom** is **unlikely to admit the
bankruptcy**]{.mark} of many-to-**[most SC]{.mark} efforts**, the time
[is]{.mark} now to reconsider the]{.underline} blind
[\[**[warrantless]{.mark}**\] **[faith]{.mark}** in SC as the wave of
the future]{.underline}.

There are two general rationales for conducting SC. On one hand, U.S.
forces seek to increase the capabilities of foreign partners and their
ability to interoperate with U.S. and coalition troops. On the other, SC
is seen as a tool to gain and maintain access to key leaders and
critical facilities in foreign nations, providing the toehold before the
toehold needed to enable contingency response. This idea of gaining
access through SC can also be expanded to gaining influence over foreign
partners due to close and continuing SC relationships. Unfortunately,
the reality generally falls far short of the ideal in both cases.

When it comes to capacity building, [efforts are all too often
**wasted**]{.underline}. In a limited number of cases---predominantly
with more elite units trained by special operations forces and in a few
partner countries serious about developing their military---capacity
building works well. In the remainder of cases, [capacity building
efforts are an **exercise in futility** as [evinced by]{.mark} the
[**numerous cases** in which **decades of SC**]{.mark} have **[yielded
no perceptible change]{.mark}** in the capabilities of partner
militaries. Individual and unit **skills remain abysmal**]{.underline}
and despite high-dollar purchases of prestige weaponry, these militaries
are [generally unable to conduct routine maintenance, logistical, and
training functions despite SC campaigns designed to enable these
critical supporting capabilities]{.underline}. As a result, warehouses
become dusty trophy cases of expensive U.S. military equipment that is
either unusable due to poor maintenance status, or ineffective due to
the lack of trained operators and command and control capabilities.

Measuring the effectiveness of security cooperation has long been an
elusive, pervasive and complicated ordeal. Due to congressional
guidance, there is a building impetus to ameliorate the established
approach and develop new ways to meet this challenge. To remain
relevant, security cooperation practitioners must become creative,
methodical, and rigorous in their assessments of past and future
initiatives to unambiguously demonstrate the positive impact of their
proposals. Customized training will go a long way towards addressing
this, but there will also have to be organizational changes.

**[[S]{.mark}ecurity]{.underline}** assistance and
[**[c]{.mark}ooperation** has been [a **critical pillar** of]{.mark}
U.S. **[statecraft]{.mark}** for decades]{.underline}. The post-9/11
interest in using assistance and cooperation to incentivize and enable
local partners contributed to the creation of a slew of new authorities
and programs. Yet, despite its strategic centrality and large price tag,
our report argues that [**[many]{.mark} security** assistance and
**cooperation** [programs **fail**]{.mark} to achieve U.S. objectives
[because of **strategic** and **structural
deficiencies**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Strategically, U.S. policymakers are often not clear about the specific
outcomes they intend to achieve with security assistance and
cooperation. Even when objectives are clear, there may be too many of
them for a single program, which results in conflicting objectives. This
is especially troublesome when pressing, short-term objectives subvert
long-term U.S. goals. Also, [there is]{.underline} currently [no system
in place to adequately assess outcomes]{.underline}. This not only risks
wasting taxpayers' dollars. [**[Failure to assess]{.mark}** progress and
adjust programs accordingly [can **actually reduce U.S.
influence**]{.mark} with recipient states, which may believe they can
free-ride or begin to view assistance as an entitlement]{.underline}.
The practice of using security assistance to build relationships
sometimes contributes to this problem. So does the fact that
policymakers too often look to security assistance as a quick fix or way
to address demands to "do something."

with security cooperation stakeholders, decisionmakers, and

their priorities for AME revealed an overwhelming concern with informing
better outcomes now and improving future policy and programs, closely
followed by improving utilization of security cooperation as a tool and

Intensity Conflict oversees a promising evaluation process for its
Section 2282 Train and Equip program.

In the case of the Section 2282 program, DoD uses a small team of
independent outside evaluators who have established reasonable, common
standards of capability and performance for the types of missions
supported by this authority. These standards are applicable to all
partner nations that receive assistance. The team visits the recipient
partner organizations about one year after training and equipment is
provided, both to monitor use of the assistance and to evaluate the
effects of that assistance. Results--- the good, the bad, and the
ugly---are consolidated into an annual report that highlights key points
for the Secretary of Defense to transmit to Congress. The teams have
been to 20 countries in the past four years and have documented their
approach in a handbook to ensure consistency of application.

[RAND is working with DoD to help it apply lessons from various
organizations and create a framework that can be applied across the
entire department to establish roles and responsibilities for managing
AM&E more effectively]{.underline}. We hope this will support Congress's
requirement in Section 1202 of the 2016 National Defense Authorization
Act for DoD to issue a strategic framework prioritizing security
cooperation resources and activities.

Elusive and Misunderstood

[[It is **difficult**]{.mark} to ascertain if a security cooperation
initiative is **effective or not**]{.underline}.\[iii\] [This could be
in part **[because]{.mark}** most of the **[indicators]{.mark}** of
success **[used by s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation
[stakeholders]{.mark}** may **[not]{.mark}** be focused on measures of
[**effectiveness**, **but**]{.mark} of **performance**, i.e.,
[**quantity** of equipment]{.mark} delivered [and]{.mark} number of
[units]{.mark} trained]{.underline}. [As one begins to peel back the
layers of an initiative, it becomes apparent that the necessary
**[in-depth analysis]{.mark}** which forecasts secondary and tertiary
orders of effect may have been [**overlooked**, along with]{.mark}
**critical, [measurable metrics]{.mark}** [that explain]{.mark} how an
initiative would specifically elicit [a]{.mark} proposed
**[reaction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The example utilized by Maj Croshier
described the unanticipated difficulties of providing a C-208 fixed-wing
reconnaissance aircraft and Command and Control (C2) equipment to Niger,
Chad, and Cameroon. The focus of this initiative was placed mainly on
the equipment, without fully accounting for the significant personnel,
doctrinal, and maintenance challenges that would ensue.

It is also worth highlighting that these types of issues are not solely
to the DoD. A few years back, the Department of State's Bureau of
Political-Military Affairs, Office of Security Assistance (PM/SA),
created an Assessment, Monitoring, and Evaluation (AM&E) team to
evaluate the efficacy of Foreign Military Sales (FMF) and International
Military Education and Training (IMET). This year, the team released a
study that found that initial reporting from the field demonstrated
various issues with the way FMF is being implemented. In particular, a
lack of understanding of the long-term maintenance requirements for
military equipment grants.\[iv\] The report also mentioned that most of
the current initiatives do not sufficiently take into account the
economic viability of a partner nation. This often results in the
partner nation feeling forced to keep the donated equipment operational,
straining their maintenance budget and reducing their funding for other
programs. This generates negative consequences for the bilateral
relationship and potentially creates additional security challenges for
the partner country.

The Million-Dollar Paperweight

Unfortunately, as mentioned above, [it is difficult to ascertain if a
security cooperation initiative has achieved its objective solely by
**measuring the delivery of equipment**. This is **[due]{.mark}** in
part [to]{.mark} the use of subjective measurements to evaluate them,
such as narratives, and the still nascent and [**limited
implementation** of]{.mark} standardized **[AM&E]{.mark}**
efforts]{.underline}. However, based on the recurrence of this issue and
the results from the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, Office of
Security Assistance (PM/SA) report, one could deduce that perhaps the
root of the problem is an overreliance on military equipment grants by
security cooperation practitioners. And, although it's hard to pinpoint
why exactly, there could be a very simple reason why stakeholders prefer
this option. The most likely answer is because the system itself is
built to reward those who demonstrate something measurable happened
during their evaluation period.

Whereas developing a strategic bilateral document could substantially
help mature a bilateral relationship, it could take years to accomplish
and there is no guarantee it will come to fruition. Amongst security
cooperation stakeholders, ordering equipment is a far less risky
endeavor with a substantially higher chance of completion. The problem
is that the equipment itself is seldom the answer to complex security
challenges. For every piece of equipment, there must be a sizable
support footprint that ensures its continued operation. [**Far too
often**, security cooperation practitioners become **fixated** on the
metrics associated with the **number** of individuals **trained** or the
**costs** of the equipment donated, not fully understanding if either
the training or the equipment will demonstrably resolve the **security
challenge**]{.underline}.

Communicating Results to Affect Change

With competing priorities diverting the attention of the U.S. leadership
away from SSA, [SSA implementers should **communicate results
effectively**. Doing so **[can affect positive change]{.mark}** in AM&E
for SSA programming; it can also have implications for
**resourcing**]{.underline}. [Strategically, **connecting SSA goals to
broader U.S. policy objectives** and **framing success from that lens**
is one way to accomplish this]{.underline}. It requires not only
reconciling potential mismatches in objectives between the programmatic
and strategic level but also to establish a common and cohesive
operating framework and vision between planners and implementors,
bridging the gap internally before then communicating with U.S.
government leadership. [Incorporating these elements into AM&E for SSA
will serve **[not only]{.mark}** as [a **forcing function for**]{.mark}
**the SSA [bureaucracy to get its house in order]{.mark}** [but]{.mark}
could [also]{.mark} **[provide examples of progress and success that can
be shared with policymakers to affect change]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**Better AM&E for SSA** can **[help the community tell its story more
effectively]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Facilitating dialogue and [communication within the interagency will be
just as important as doing so with Congress]{.underline}. The
interagency AM&E community must also work on better utilizing its
monitoring data to inform course corrections and, one step further,
communicate the process and results effectively to the strategic level.
[This will help illustrate the connection between programs and foreign
policy goals at the country and regional level for Washington-based
policymakers]{.underline}. This should also include communicating
behavioral changes and perception changes to understand locally
legitimate authorities and how trust is shifting on-the-ground. Taking
advantage of moments of political and policy transition is also critical
and will require leadership and coordination between the higher echelons
of the SSA interagency. AM&E can provide real time feedback to make this
coordination easier and more efficient.

Finally, [**[communicating]{.mark} SSA [results]{.mark}** [using the
**r**]{.mark}eturn **[o]{.mark}**n **[i]{.mark}**nvestment
**[paradigm]{.mark}** may **[create a greater impact amongst
policymakers]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The U.S. SSA community should
leverage AM&E in a way that communicates the rewards of SSA programming
reaped by the United States. This method should include demonstrating
U.S. dollars are being put to good use through measurable progress in
areas such as increased capacity and capability within the recipient
country, improved political will to correct certain behaviors,
co-investing from within the recipient country or through outside allies
and partners, and the overall quality of recipient engagement.

[**[Addressing the challenges]{.mark}** of evaluation also
[requires]{.mark} breaking down the process of evaluation into its
component parts, which we think of as "**[AM&E]{.mark}**": baseline
assessments, monitoring of performance, and evaluations of
effectiveness]{.underline}. But before looking at AM&E---and this
relates to my earlier point about prioritization---senior leaders must
decide what is worth measuring. In command headquarters in Afghanistan,
Germany, Iraq, Honolulu, and Tampa, [[I have seen **massive slide
presentations** and **spreadsheets**]{.mark} analyzing various security
cooperation activities [until it **all becomes a
blur**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and I surrender to the operations

may well be important for the organizations in which they reside, but
[evaluations **must translate into something that can highlight a few

## !---COMPETITION

### AT: !/D -- No GPC

#### [Critics]{.underline} are [wrong]{.underline} -- competition is [fact, NOT strategy]{.underline}, there's [no winning]{.underline}, merely [managing to survive]{.underline}

As the Pentagon readies its new National Defense Strategy, [[the
**commentariat**]{.mark}---unsurprisingly---has]{.underline} some
t[houghts]{.underline}. While the perspectives are, no doubt, as varied
as the array of think tanks and universities from which they spring,
there seems to be [a significant [**piling on** against]{.mark} both the
**"Great Power Competition"**]{.underline} that animated Trump-era
guidance [and]{.underline} the (allegedly distinct) [**"[Strategic
Competition]{.mark}"** terminology advanced by the Biden
administration]{.underline}. [But "competition" is a rare instance of
bipartisan continuity because [it **speaks to real and important
dynamics**]{.mark} in the international system]{.underline}, and it has
led to important new thinking in our approach to national security. [We
should not be so quick to discard it]{.underline}.

[Rather than **abandoning competition**, **it is time now to double
down**]{.underline}. The Pentagon strategy [should embrace]{.underline}
a robust concept of **[integrated deterrence]{.underline}**, and the
White House should lead with a National Security Strategy (NSS) [rooted
in a **holistic approach** to **Competitive Statecraft**]{.underline}.

The [critics are [right that]{.mark}]{.underline} Great Power
Competition (**["[GPC]{.mark}"]{.underline}**) [[has become a]{.mark}
vacuous catch-all, a **[magic word]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as CNAS's
Wasser and Pettyjohn tell it, [that can justify "every force,
capability, or resource request." [But]{.mark}]{.underline} that's a
perennial bureaucratic tendency; [the [same]{.mark} was [true of]{.mark}
CT and then COIN]{.underline} in the Bush and Obama years,
[and]{.underline} probably [[any]{.mark} number of **[terms du
jour]{.mark}** in prior eras]{.underline}. We should always work to
minimize these abuses, but we won\'t eliminate them as long as we use
words to describe our priorities. Other [**critiques** are **less
valid** and far **less helpful**]{.underline}.

[[The idea that]{.mark} an emphasis on **[competition
precludes]{.mark}** the possibility of [**cooperation** is]{.mark} an
**unhelpful [reductio ad absurdum]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Pundits may
not be able to sustain two competing ideas at once, but the
international system always does, and the military clearly can: emerging
[U.S. doctrine envisions a **competition
continuum**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in which "the joint force... campaigns
through a mixture of cooperation, competition below armed conflict, and
armed conflict calculated to achieve the desired strategic objectives."
As Daniel H. Nexon points out, "[**[Even during the Cold War]{.mark}**,
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet Union
worked out a variety of formal and informal rules that [helped]{.mark}
them **[manage]{.mark} competition**, limit **nuclear prolif**eration,
and otherwise **structure international relations**]{.underline}." ([It
is **unclear** how **Nexon** intends this observation to **support** his
**argument against competition**]{.underline}.)

[Equally **unhelpful** is the common **complaint** that the phrase
"'strategic competition' reflects **uncertainty** about **what that
competition is over** and **what it means to win**]{.underline}." Here
again, [while it might stymie the pundits]{.underline}, this
intellectual hurdle [seems not to have tripped up our military
leaders]{.underline}---they have been consistent in [identifying the
**stakes** of this **competition** as the "**rules-based international
order** that brought **prosperity** and **relative peace** for the last
**seven decades**]{.underline}."

[And "[**what it means to win**" is]{.mark} just [the **wrong
question**---that's the **whole point**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Echoing
George Kennan (\"[We have been **[handicapped]{.mark}** ...
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} a popular [**[attachment to]{.mark}** the
concept of [a **basic difference between peace and
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}...\"), the
**[[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}** discussion [is enabling the
military to finally]{.underline}---against all odds---[**[shed the idea
of war as a finite game]{.mark}** that starts with an opening salvo of
munitions and ends with a ceasefire and a treaty. The fixation on
"winning" [breeds **fatal short-termism**]{.mark}]{.underline}---see the
common refrain that we didn\'t fight a twenty-year war in Afghanistan,
but rather twenty one-year wars.

What all these simplistic critiques miss is the simple old truth that
the enemy gets a vote. [**Nexon** wants us to **consider
[competition]{.mark} as a means rather than an end**. **But it's
neither**---it's [just **a**]{.mark} **plain [fact of our strategic
environment]{.mark}**, and the last round of guidance intended to
highlight it as **the most salient one for U.S. strategy**]{.underline}.
[It may or may not have been true, but we operated for much of the last
thirty years as though we did not have any real competitors,
ideologically or materially]{.underline}. The "end of history" trope
after the Cold War was premised on the absence of an ideological
alternative to liberal democracy; and if 9-11 proved that wrong, [the
"asymmetric" modifier we appended to the "warfare" of the Global War on
Terror reassured us that]{.underline} proponents of radical Islam
[lacked the **resources** to make their vision an **existential
threat**]{.underline}.

[But the long-term ascendency of]{.underline} liberal, democratic ideals
and [**rules-based international order** is **neither inevitable** **nor
irreversible**]{.underline}. [There are **alternatives** on offer, and
they are **actively being pursued** by **adversaries** whose
**capabilities** **across many domains** threaten to **eclipse our
own**]{.underline} in the not-so-distant future. These are the facts,
and they demand our attention. The last NSS and NDS were right to frame
them that way.

[We **must prevent** the **loss of our competitive advantage** and
**deterrent capacity** in **conventional** and **nuclear
warfare**---competition should not prevent that; properly conceived,
competition demands it]{.underline}. (The Pentagon understands this,
too.) But the most pernicious element of these arguments against
competition is the insinuation---or the outright assertion---that we can
or should focus on high-end capabilities to the exclusion of all else.
This requires a willful disregard of everything we have learned about
the gray zone/hybrid warfare/choose-your-appellation. After all, while
our high-end advantage has eroded, it is not gone. We have so far
deterred major conventional and nuclear war, but our
adversaries---especially those near-peer "great powers"---have found
countless ways to improve their strategic position and degrade ours
without triggering a conventional military response. High-end deterrence
is necessary, but it's clearly not sufficient. [The **accumulation of
minor setbacks** can be **existential**, not just because of their
obvious and **immediate effects**, but because they can **degrade** our
long-term ability to generate and **project conventional
power**]{.underline}.

For all its emphasis on GPC, the last NDS [recognized the interrelated
nature of threats at all points on the competition
continuum]{.underline}. This was made especially clear in the Irregular
Warfare Annex: "State adversaries and their proxies increasingly seek to
prevail through their own use of irregular warfare, \[suggesting\] the
need for a revised understanding of IW to account for its role as a
component of great power competition."

[What we need is **not** a **narrower concept of deterrence** but a
**broader** one that focuses **not just** on the **future conflict** we
**could lose** but also on the **ongoing competition** we are
**currently losing**]{.underline}. Perhaps [this is where]{.underline}
Secretary Austin's nascent ["**integrated deterrence**"]{.underline}
idea [is headed.]{.underline} He seems to want [to **integrate across
domains** and **tech**nologie**s** and **with allies**]{.underline}, and
who could argue? Well, lots of people, including Representative Mike
Gallagher (R, WI), who has apparently been reading his Pettyjohn: "What
we actually need to integrate is more conventional hard power---more
ships, more long-range missiles and more long-range bombers in the
Indo-Pacific."

Gallagher here is giving voice to [a perpetual **false
choice**]{.underline} we frame [between **conventional** and
**irregular** capabilities]{.underline}. But as the IW Annex said,
[competing in the contested space "**does not require significant new
resources**... it requires new ideas and **new means of employing
existing capabilities**]{.underline}." The limiting factor is not in our
pocketbooks, it's between our ears. Educating for IW may not lead to
great photo-ops, but it could lead to better outcomes below the
threshold of major war, which would be worth a great deal more.
Unfortunately, after our inglorious exit from Afghanistan, it seems we
are determined to repeat what the Annex called "the 'boom and bust'
cycle that has left the United States underprepared for irregular
warfare in both Great Power Competition and conflict."

Some Congressional leaders are pushing back. Last year\'s NDAA included
authorization to establish a DOD center for studying irregular warfare.
This year\'s bill is still in draft, but both chambers have provisions
demanding an implementation plan for the IW Annex, and the House bill
would require a report on the establishment of the center. Educating for
IW may not lead to great photo-ops, but it could lead to better outcomes
below the threshold of major war, which would be worth a great deal
more.

With all due respect to Secretary Austin, [an **integrated deterrence**
worth its name would be integrated **both** vertically and horizontally.
**Vertically**, it would supplement our **nuclear** and **conventional**
**deterrence** with **unconventional** deterrence to provide creative
and seamless response **options other than "do nothing" and "all-out
war**." **Horizontally**, along **with allies** and partners, it would
**integrate military force** with the **other instruments** of U.S.
national power]{.underline}.

#### Fettweis is [wrong]{.underline} -- [absence]{.underline} of [competition]{.underline} and [presence]{.underline} of [effective US partnerships]{.underline} have [greater explanatory power]{.underline}

In his recent Congressional testimony, the Director of the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Marine Lt. Gen. Vince Stewart provided a worldwide
threat assessment that noted "A confluence of global political,
military, social, and technological developments, which, taken in
aggregate, have created security challenges more diverse and complex
than those we have experienced in our lifetimes."

This judgment runs directly counter to the arguments in a new book with
a question as its title: A Dangerous World? The central theme of this
anthology is that perceptions of the threats the United States faces are
unrealistic or manifestly exaggerated. The contributors to this
anthology are commendably consistent on these points, to a fault. They
want the country and the Pentagon to confront real threats rather than
preferred demons and warn the reader to be leery about accepting the
"revealed wisdom" about the dangers the people of the United States
face. In that regard, this book is a healthy (but not entirely
convincing) exercise in challenging longstanding threat perceptions.

The 16 chapters of this tightly edited volume are penned by an
impressive array of American academics. One of the early chapters comes
from the co-editor, Professor John Mueller, a member of the Hall of Fame
of Congenital Contrarians. He has thrown a lot of cold water in his
career on hyperbolic threat prognosticators. His essay on proliferation
and terrorism is soundly presented but is limited to nuclear threats.
Professor Mueller's perspective on the implications of proliferation
comes off as too narrow and far too optimistic. He is correct that the
pace of nuclear proliferation has been slower than feared, but of
course, this decrease did not happen organically. Rather it was the
product of active policy measures to increase pressure on states.
Mueller fails to give credit to the establishment of these norms or the
explicit pressures placed on proliferating states. He is probably right
that "the consequences of proliferation that has taken place have been
substantially benign." But I disagree that proliferation by North Korea
or Iran is quite as benign as say India and Israel. [[**Many analysts**
believe]{.mark} that **[strategic stability]{.mark}** in the Second
Nuclear Age [is **weakening**]{.mark}, generating more rather than less
danger]{.underline}.

As the current cover story in the Economist notes:

[The new nuclear age is built on shakier foundations]{.underline}.
[Although there are fewer nuclear weapons]{.underline} than at the
height of the cold war, [[the **possibility** of]{.mark} some of them
being [use]{.mark}d [is **higher** and **growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
That increasing possibility feeds the likelihood of more countries
choosing the nuclear option, which in turn increases the sense of
instability.

Former American intelligence analyst Paul Pillar assesses the dangers of
terrorism in his chapter. He observes, "The idea that substate disorder
overseas threatens U.S. interest is rooted in the tendency of Americans
to go abroad in search of monsters to destroy." Pillar challenges the
idea that every failed state is a "safe haven" for Al Qaeda to plot
another 9/11. The notions of safe havens are far less significant, he
notes "in an era of globalization and globe-spanning information
technology in which planning, recruitment, and the direction of
operations take place at least as much in virtual space as they do in
physical space." What Pillar does not address is groups like the Islamic
State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Boko Haram who are now seizing
and holding not just safe havens but large swathes of real estate. It's
not clear that the United States can defang ISIL since it is evident
U.S. leaders do not understand it. But overall, until such groups
challenge our core interests, Pillar rightfully argues the United States
should not make matters worse.

Martin Libicki from RAND focused on cybersecurity, particularly our
homeland security. Libicki notes that much of what concerns our society
about cybersecurity is actually criminal behavior, not a true national
security challenge. Even in his most speculative scenario of an attack
on critical infrastructure, he does not estimate damages of \$1 billion,
which "is unlikely to be catastrophic -- though the damage could be
magnified considerably by hasty and ill-considered overreaction." His
views are consistent with other scholars including Kings College London
lecturer Thomas Rid. While cybersecurity at home is overdone, Americans
should be more pessimistic when it comes to military capabilities given
the U.S. military's huge reliance upon cyber connectivity and networked
computer systems. U.S. forces are highly dependent on the secure use of
IT-based systems for the conduct of operations, and remain vulnerable.

Joshua Shrifrinson and Sameer Lalwani offer a number of critical
observations on maritime security. They note the United States has a
sizable lead in maritime power over potential competitors and there are
very few threats to freedom of the seas or direct threats to our ability
to access the oceans. Shrifrinson and Lalwani attack the notion that the
United States has an obligation to preserve freedom of access to the
global commons for everyone else's benefit. They effectively undercut
the U.S. Navy's stress on controlling the Global Commons, but their
argument falls apart when then assert that competitors have little
interest to contest U.S. command at sea or to seriously impact sea lanes
of communication. The authors insist that no one will come close to U.S.
capabilities for 20 years, and that China "lacks the ability,
opportunity, or motivation to seriously challenge American command."
Instead of engagement and forward presence, their stated preference is
for a more "hands off" approach that relies perilously upon regional
actors. This is simply a form of off-shore balancing -- what they define
as "security of the commons." The implication of this approach is that
the United States could put a premium into convoy security,
anti-submarine warfare, and missile defenses, while reducing forward
presence onshore and our power projection forces. This approach, they
contend, would "limit the spirals of insecurity that might cause
challenges to American command to emerge, while pocketing the fiscal and
political savings of a smaller footprint abroad."

This argument fails to consider China's own advances and its ongoing
provocations in the Pacific, nor does it represent an understanding
about how U.S. maritime dominance relates to our geopolitical interests
or the reassurance of U.S. allies in the Pacific. Further, the authors
do not satisfyingly explore the emerging combination of shore and
sea-based cruise missiles in both the Pacific and the Persian Gulf.
Several intelligence sources note Iran's acquisition of more advanced
capabilities including anti-ship cruise missiles and Chinese influence
mines that will further complicate efforts to protect commerce in the
Gulf. Rather than gut U.S. power projection and forward presence, the
American people should realize that its Navy is dangerously smaller than
it should be.

Christopher Fettweis of Tulane University wraps up the major
contributors with a sweeping essay. [To **Fettweis**, the world we live
in today "is by all reasonable historical standards, a golden age of
peace and security]{.underline}." He continues, "The [great powers seem
to have given up fighting one another, and the lesser powers rarely go
to war either, and levels of internal conflict are at all-time
lows]{.underline}." [From his perspective there is an incontrovertible
"growing mountain of evidence" that we live in an age where risks to our
security are far lower than they are commonly thought]{.underline}.
Habits of mind, hangovers from 9/11, and institutional constituencies
are accorded as responsible for our "delusions of danger."

[[**Fettweis** is perplexed]{.mark} by the prevalence of higher threat
and risk perceptions]{.underline} held by many Americans, especially
those [in the national security establishment]{.underline}. Perhaps it
is [[because **"risk" is more than**]{.mark} **looking at [the number of
ongoing wars]{.mark}**, where our policy has failed, or where interests
are not engaged]{.underline}. Maybe it is related to perceptions of
threats by policymakers from China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran that
do not yet cross the threshold of war. Perhaps it is related to a deep
understanding of human history and nature, rather than a truncated
picture of the last generation where geopolitical pressures were at an
all-time but transitory low. Perhaps it is because [most of these
[countries have **sharply expanded**]{.mark} **their [military
capacities and spending]{.mark} levels** [and **expressed**]{.mark}
**their [intent to use]{.mark} their military [force]{.mark}s** rather
than let them lie fallow]{.underline}. I've written in War on the Rocks
before about the dangers of "culpable complacency."

These shortcomings aside, readers will be impressed with the effort in A
Dangerous World? and appreciate its contribution to a rigorous
understanding of various threats. Several contributors score points in
debunking myths. But the book did not alter my own assessment of the
future for two reasons. First, too many of the authors tended to look
backwards or focused in the present tense, and failed to extend threats
into the future in a serious way. Potential challenges in the cyber and
biotech domain come to mind, for example. When it comes to imagining our
defense needs, we should look at trends with clear eyes and some
imagination. One must examine trends and continuities, as well as
projected discontinuities. Most of the authors in this volume were not
so inclined. The combination of China's assertiveness, Putin's
megalomania, the dawning of revolutions in cognitive, bioscience, and
nanotechnology, and the socio-political eruptions of the Arab world,
make a prudent strategist question assumptions about a constant glide
slope to a peaceful and just world.

Second, I am inclined to [see the [progress]{.mark} of the last
quarter-century as [**a deliberate byproduct of America's ability**
to]{.mark} create and [**enforce a rules-based system** **with its
allies**]{.mark}, not as evidence of a global community that is
inexorably marching along a linear and preordained path toward perpetual
peace and shared prosperity]{.underline}. I do
**[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}** discount progress but nor do I believe
that it is **[[self-generating]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and am [[**very
skeptical** it can be **sustained in the absence** of **strong U.S.
leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[That **linear pattern of reduced
conflict**]{.mark} totals, evident a few years ago, [**has flattened
out** and **could worsen if we do not work to preserve** our]{.mark}
nation's core **[security interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[The **conditions that generated**]{.mark} those previously **[positive
trends]{.mark}** -- **[lack of g]{.mark}reat [p]{.mark}ower
[c]{.mark}ompetition**, reduced resource pressure, broad economic
development, and generous support for conflict resolution **[are
dissolving]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In short, geopolitics, uneven
economic development, human misery, and miscalculating leaders could
ensure the return of history. Complacency and retrenchment on our part
will only hasten it.

For a more future-oriented book, the National Intelligence Council's
Global Trends 2030 is a useful antidote to presentism. Matt Burrow's new
book The Future Declassified also looks at the future with balance,
humility, and fidelity. Readers are encouraged to take a look at Chris
Coker's new book, The Improbable War, which warns about the dangerous
pattern of thinking that a war with China is unlikely. On the Middle
East, readers would do well to read any of the penetrating articles by
Washington Post foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius.

While this book points out the dangers of careless Cassandras, [we
**should not wear rose colored glasses** as we peer into the future. It
is **not "pathologically parochial"**]{.underline} to side, as I do,
with General Dempsey's latest statement to Congress and with retired
Marine General James Mattis. The latter recently testified and
emphasized that our position in the world is not self-sustaining. As
former NSC and State Department official Nicholas Rostow has noted
"Fundamental principles of world public order are at risk or directly
challenged in Afghanistan, Ukraine, and the western Pacific," and dire
consequences for ignoring them.

[The general theme]{.underline} of A Dangerous World? [is that risks to
our well-being and security are overstated, and **[security
investments]{.mark}** significantly **[reduced]{.mark}**. That would be
[a **huge error**]{.mark} in my mind. Making that error [would]{.mark}
do more to **[completely undo]{.mark}** what progress has been made and
**[long peace]{.mark}** we have enjoyed]{.underline}. I just see little
justification as an historian for history to be cast as linear or
evolutionary progress that moves inexorably only in one direction. [We
live in a better world right now, one which America's influence and arms
have helped shape]{.underline}. If we want to see positive trends
continue it will not be achieved merely by retrenching our defense
spending or retreating from the world stage. Stephen Pinker's arguments
notwithstanding, a true appreciation of history serves as a reminder of
the folly of utopian thinking.

Overall, A Dangerous World? explored current threats and poked some
holes at overhyped threats. It is strongly encouraged for classroom use
in Security Studies programs since it promotes critical thinking. In the
dangerous world we live in now and for the near future, we must see the
world clearly. We need to separate true threats from routine problems,
and differentiate between the unacceptable and the manageable. A
Dangerous World? will help isolate the hype from the dangers we must
fully confront.

studied in its own right.8 [Some **studies** of reputation and alliances
exist, but are **predominantly focused on alliance formation rather than
management**]{.underline}.9 Because loyalty has not received the
significant scholarly attention centered on resolve, [alliance
interdependence is **undertheorized**]{.underline}.10 [**But** as the
contemporary debate about Taiwan highlights, [**beliefs** about]{.mark}
loyalty and **[alliance interdependence]{.mark}** could be [a **decisive
influence on policy**]{.mark} today]{.underline}. If alliance
interdependence exists, scholars and policymakers urgently need to know
how it works.

I argue that [both the **deterrence theorists** and the **reputation
skeptics** are **wrong**]{.underline}. Alliance interdependence
exists---what happens in one alliance can affect others---but this is
not determined by a national moral character of innate loyalty. [When a
state observes its ally\'s behavior in another alliance, it does not
hope to see loyalty per se. Instead, it hopes to see **proof** that the
**ally\'s interests align** with its own]{.underline}. In some cases, it
will be in the observer state\'s interest for its ally to fulfill a
separate alliance commitment---that is, the state will want its ally to
be loyal to the other ally. But in other cases, where loyalty would not
be in the observer state\'s interest, it will want its ally to be
disloyal to the other ally. [This reasoning contrasts starkly with other
theories, which expect that a state will always want its ally to
demonstrate inherent, pure loyalty. I argue that the state is
unconcerned about whether its ally\'s behavior is loyal or disloyal in
any objective or moral sense. **Rather**, [when]{.mark} the state is
**[confident]{.mark} that its [ally\'s interests align]{.mark}** with
its own, [and]{.mark} therefore the alliance [**poses no risk**
of]{.mark} either [**abandonment** or **entrapment**]{.mark},
[then]{.mark} the ally [is **reliable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.11
[**[Observed reliability]{.mark}**---**[not]{.mark}** innate
**[loyalty]{.mark}**---[is **what states want**]{.mark} from
allies]{.underline}. [**[If]{.mark}** an ally poses **[risks]{.mark}**
of [**entrapment**, **abandonment**, or **both**, then]{.mark} it [is
**unreliable**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the state **[will act to mitigate
these risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Responses could [include
**hedging**]{.mark}, diplomatic restraint initiatives, intra-alliance
bargaining, threats of **[defection]{.mark}**, **[attempts to
entrap]{.mark}** the ally, or, in extremis, alliance abrogation,
bandwagoning, [or **nuclear prolif**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.12

[**Deterrence theory** recommends that states **fight for reputation**,
and **skeptics** urge policymakers **not** to **worry about reputation
costs**. I argue that [**adroit alliance management** requires]{.mark}
understanding how developments in one alliance can affect the
**[reliability perceptions]{.mark}** and behavior of other
allies]{.underline}. The United States may need to fight---or not
fight---to ensure that allies still perceive it as reliable. [If the
true nature of interdependence is recognized, [the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
**[[can manage]{.mark} alliance [interdependence without being captive
to]{.mark} a "cult of [reputation]{.mark}]{.underline}**."13

In the first section of this article, I examine existing theories of
reputation, loyalty, and alliance interdependence, and critique the
belief that states want their allies to be indiscriminately loyal. In
the second section, I explain why [the concept of **alliance
reliability** [has **greater explanatory power**]{.mark} than the idea
of loyalty]{.underline}. [I propose hypotheses on reliability and
alliance interdependence and contrast these with deterrence theory and
Mercer\'s reputation-skeptic argument]{.underline}. In the third
section, I use process tracing and archival research of the First Taiwan
Strait Crisis (1954--55) to test my theory of alliance reliability. I
show that although U.S. decisionmakers fretted about being perceived as
disloyal to the Republic of China (ROC, or Nationalist China), most
allies actively encouraged the United States to compel an ROC withdrawal
from disputed territories and thus reduce the risk of conflict. In the
final section, I summarize my findings and explain their implications
for theory and policy.

Ample evidence---including the global surge in coups d'états and crises
of police violence from Brazil and Nigeria to the Philippines---shows
that dozens of countries must improve not only the "kinetic" capacities,
but also their governance, of police, military and other security
institutions. Yet a first outline last week of the new U.S. "initiative
for democratic renewal" omits any mention of this vital task. [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies must re-shape
their assistance to support democracy]{.underline} and human rights. [In
some countries---for example Egypt and Uganda---U.S. security sector
assistance has helped to consolidate authoritarianism. Current trends
risk exacerbating the problem in a "race to the bottom" among the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Russia and
China]{.underline}.

[U.S. policies too often set aside]{.underline} the nation's [commitment
to democratic values on a flawed assumption that this is necessary to
advance U.S. interests amid great-power competition. Yet **democratic
backsliding** and **authoritarianism** create long-term risks of
**violence**, **instability** and **extremism**]{.underline}. Even
measured by the narrower metric of strategic military alliances, these
risks weaken U.S. security interests. Serious democratic backsliding
preceded Turkey's decision to purchase one or more Russian S-400 missile
defense systems. Democratic backsliding in the Philippines weakened the
U.S.-Philippine security relationship to the point of endangering the
agreement that has enabled a U.S. troop presence in the Philippines.
Worldwide, democratic deficiencies help push countries into the arms of
China or Russia.

How **[[Security Assistance]{.mark} Can Hurt Democracies]{.underline}**

The United States and others have historically ignored the significance
of effective security sector governance for consolidating democracy.
Donor countries have treated security sector reform as a technical
problem, rather than a political endeavor that can change power dynamics
and the political trajectory in a country. The [[**recent coups** in
**Sudan**, **Mali**, **Guinea**, **Myanmar** and **Chad** show]{.mark}
how an emboldened military and weak or absent civilian control over
security forces may **[not simply weaken democracy, but end
it]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To promote peace, stability, democracy and U.S. strategic objectives,
the United States helps violence-afflicted nations with assistance to
strengthen civil society, political parties, and legislative oversight.
Yet the people overthrowing civilian, elected rule in Chad, Guinea and
Mali this year were military officers who had been direct beneficiaries
of U.S. training. This agonizing irony underscores that we can no longer
neglect the central importance for democracy of helping nations improve
security sector governance.

[In these latest coups and in other examples, we see how **security
assistance [itself can undermine democracy]{.mark}** [when it]{.mark}
effectively "[super-sizes]{.mark}" a vulnerable nation's [security
services relative to]{.mark} weaker democratic, [civilian
institutions]{.mark} that are meant to control them]{.underline}. [Where
governments lack funding and capacities to meet populations' basic
needs, this danger skyrockets. Yet in too many cases---Egypt, Mali,
Niger, the Philippines and others---U.S. and other security assistance
has led to significant increases in military and security budgets at the
expense of strengthening other critical services]{.underline}.
[Ill-balanced security assistance especially risks weakening democratic
governance where it has backed major counterterrorism
operations]{.underline}.

Egypt is a prime example. In the past four years, U.S. bilateral
assistance to Egypt has been \$1.4 billion per year, most of that to pay
for Egypt to buy U.S.-made weapons. While this assistance has not
enabled Egypt to end the threats from its terrorist groups in Sinai, it
has buttressed the military regime, which now controls much of the
country's economy. Under current law and policy, only \$300 million of
the United States' bilateral aid in FY 2021 was subject to being
withheld by the State Department if Egypt failed to meet certain human
rights and rule-of-law standards. The threat to withhold 23 percent of
its assistance is far too little to show a powerful U.S. commitment to
democracy, rights and governance. It reflects the relatively small
amount that the United States has invested in promoting good governance.

President Biden often has said, "Don\'t tell me what you value. Show me
your budget, and I\'ll tell you what you value." This month, the Biden
administration proposed spending up to \$424.4 million next year on
programs to strengthen democracy---an initiative that hardly compares to
U.S. spending of roughly \$18-20 billion each recent year on security
assistance.

A Race to the Bottom

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [current approach
[risks]{.mark} becoming [a **race to the bottom** with **China** and
**Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In recent years, countries receiving
security assistance have [encouraged **bidding wars**]{.mark} among
Russia, China, and the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to seek
the most attractive possible aid packages, including
weapons]{.underline}. [In fear of losing leverage over partners such as
Philippines or Nigeria , the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has participated]{.underline}. This allows authoritarian or
authoritarian-leaning governments to procure weapons and other equipment
and training for their militaries or police with little or no
requirement for human rights or security governance improvements. In
some cases, the fear of losing leverage may be unwarranted: After his
initial flirtation with a closer relationship with China, Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte understood that China's threat to his
interests is very real and shifted back to the U.S. camp.

This means the United States has compromised on democracy and human
rights for, at best, short-term gains in relations with a given country.
In the long term, however, [this approach **undermines** **stability**
and **democracy**]{.underline}. [During the Cold War]{.underline}, the
U.S.'s primary goal of maintaining partnerships with governments in
Africa to prevent them from absorbing Soviet influences yielded a
similar approach. [A RAND study concluded that "**U.S. assistance**
appears likely to have **[increased]{.mark}** the incidence of **[civil
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this period, likely [by either
exacerbating domestic instabilities or provoking **[proxy
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline}." There is no reason to believe that [a
21st-century **race to the bottom** with **Russia** and **China**, in
the interest of maintaining partnerships, will]{.underline} not [have
the **same results**]{.underline}.

**[We Can Do Better]{.underline}**

[The current U.S. approach to security sector assistance not only
**detracts** from]{.underline} President Biden's expressed goals of
[**consolidating democracy** [and]{.mark} **countering
authoritarianism**, it damages U.S. strategic interests in [**making it
easier** for **China** and **Russia** to engage with **authoritarian
regimes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the United States builds from last
week's Summit for Democracy, it needs to fully apply, and in some cases
expand, existing policies supporting democratic governance of the
security sector. [[**Key** steps]{.underline}]{.mark} will
[include]{.underline} these**[[:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

1\. Keep promises to withhold security assistance from human rights
violators. Following through on existing legislation and keeping
promises to withhold aid to bad actors is critical for the United
States' ability to support democracy abroad and for its credibility on
the international stage. U.S. policy statements describe conditionality
for aid---democratic governance and adherence to human rights
norms---that often is ignored. As in Egypt, the United States often
sustains security assistance to security partners even when countries
fall far short of critical governance and human rights benchmarks.
Frequently, senior U.S. officials may threaten to withhold aid, but
without follow-through. This needs to change if democracy consolidation
efforts are to have teeth.

2\. [[**Enforce** **a**]{.mark}**ssessment, [m]{.mark}onitoring [and
e]{.mark}valuation** requirements]{.underline}. The 2017 National
Defense Authorization Act required better assessment, monitoring and
evaluation [of security sector assistance]{.underline}. U.S. government
officials admit that this is not happening yet, and big strides need to
be taken to implement and learn from security assistance monitoring and
evaluation. This is one way [[to **ensure programming is effective**
and]{.mark} that it [helps]{.mark} broader strategic objectives,
including the **[consolidation of democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

If It Feels Like [[the]{.mark} **19[30's Are Repeating]{.mark}**
Themselves --- Only **[With Nukes]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- That's
Because They Are

There are two ways to think about the Russia's bloody and brutal and
criminal war in Ukraine. One is that Putin is a madman --- with nukes.
The second is even more chilling. It's that [**[Putin]{.mark}** himself
is [a mere **symptom**]{.mark}**, of deeper forces**]{.underline}. These
forces are vast and impersonal --- just forces of history, like great
currents beneath the waves of oceans. What do I mean? This second way to
think --- and the more that I reflect on it, the more accurate way,
perhaps --- goes like this.

[We have [many]{.mark}]{.underline}, many [Big **[Existential
Threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a world. [**[Climate change]{.mark}**,
mass extinction, **[ecological collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then
**[[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, now **[[nuclear
war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But [**[underlying all]{.mark}** of these
--- [and **unifying them**]{.mark} --- [is]{.mark} a deeply disturbing
**[political reality]{.mark}**. Over the last decade]{.underline} or
two, [[the planet has swung]{.underline}]{.mark} so **[[far
right]{.underline}]{.mark}** that it might as well have tilted on its
axis. We are beginning to live on a far right planet.

And [what kind of]{.underline} life, civilization, [**[future]{.mark}**
is really possible on a far right planet? **[Not]{.mark}** a
**[democratic]{.mark}** one. **[Not]{.mark}** a **[peaceful]{.mark}**
one]{.underline}. It looks a lot like....this one.
**[[War]{.underline}]{.mark}**, chaos, **[[hate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
rage.

This is a sea change. We haven't lived on a far right planet for a long
time. [The **last time** we had hints of such a thing was in the
19**30s**. What's happening today]{.underline} may be [even **more
troubling**]{.underline}, though, [because it's **more
widespread**]{.underline}. I [don't think]{.underline} modern
[history]{.underline} --- or even semi-modern history --- [has seen the
entire planet swing far right so fast and hard]{.underline} that the
globe is juddering in fear and agony.

Let me give you several examples of what I mean --- and then I want to
discuss why this is happening. We'll start with rich countries --- who
are the obvious ones.

In America, it's true, that Joe Biden's President --- but it's truer
that half the country or more is in open revolt against not just him,
but the idea of liberal democracy. To teach kids that gay people exist
is now a crime. Women's rights are being taken away. Minorities are
openly scapegoated. Yet another Black man was just shot in the head by a
police officer...for nothing...on video. And shortly, every indication
is that America's conservatives are going to sweep into power, and
reduce democracy to a shell, having laid the groundwork to snatch the
election by whatever means necessary, from perverting electoral
mechanisms, to another coup.

America's new wave of laws attacking women and minorities and even
teachers --- tip lines, informants, secret polices --- have roots in the
Fugitive Slave Act, which deputised anyone to be a vigilante, and
inspired the Nazis. That is how regressive its right wing revolt really
is. America is therefore already ranked as a flawed democracy.

Take another set of rich Western countries, though. Britain's head of
state is literally now found to have broken the law. He didn't resign.
Instead, he came up with a plan to ship...refugees...to Rwanda...which
is an authoritarian, totalitarian state whose record on human rights
abuses is abysmal...and all that's flagrantly against the law...again.
None of this is remotely compatible with liberal democracy --- from the
rule of law to equality to justice to truth.

Then there's Australia. Australians, deeply nationalistic people, think
proudly of themselves as a liberal democracy, and fly into a rage when
you criticise their nation. Yet the truth is their PM is a climate
change denier, they pioneered the idea of human trafficking refugees to
other countries --- breaking international law --- they have the highest
per capita carbon emissions on the planet, and none of this seems to
matter at all to them very much. Like Britain, for all intents and
purposes, Australia is heading towards the far right. How else would you
describe one whose PM denies climate change, while its ravaged by
megafloods and storms and fires --- and people just shrug?

In France, of course, Marine Le Pen is within striking distance of the
Presidency. She comes from a family of proto-Nazi sympathizers, and
openly backs Putin. Elected, she'd shred the West. She's already called
for NATO to effectively be broken up, and Frexit to happen. The EU would
no longer exist as we know it. France is right on the brink of joining
America, Australia, and Britain in hurtling towards far right politics.

Now, the rejoinder to all this will be: "At least we're not Rwanda!!"
But that isn't the test of a liberal democracy. It's whether, obviously,
a nation is living up to the ideals of a democracy. Whether it values
freedom, equality, truth, justice, decency, the rule of law, and so
forth. It's all too easy to see that in the cases I've presented to you,
these things now have little value. When your head of state denies
climate change --- truth? LOL. When he breaks the law and covers it up
by breaking the law --- justice? LOL. When a society has tip lines to
inform on neighbours for the crime of reading banned books --- equality?
Freedom? LOL.

[This phenomenon stretches right **around the world**]{.underline}. It's
not just the rich world, the West, turning so far right that Adolf
Hitler's grinning approvingly, it's also, obviously, the rest of it.
Just two short decades ago, there were high hopes that Russia would
evolve into a mature, stable, healthy democracy. Instead, it imploded
into Putinism --- and war. [The same]{.underline}, more or less, [is
true in]{.underline} China and [**India**. [Across **Asia** and
**Africa** and **Europe**]{.mark}, too]{.underline}. The planet is
turning far right.

This is a scary thing. It has never really happened before. Yes, really,
never.

[Political scientists]{.underline}, scratching their heads, began to
[call this]{.underline} phenomenon "**[[democratic
backsliding]{.underline}]{.mark}**." [But that]{.underline} turn of
phrase is inaccurate. It [implies that democracy is failing from both
sides, left and right]{.underline}. We don't live in an age, though,
where the far left is overthrowing legitimately elected democracies. We
live in one where the far right is. "Democratic backsliding" is
therefore [another way]{.underline}, really, [to say]{.underline} ---
not say, in fact --- "[we are beginning to live on a far right
planet]{.underline}."

### AT: !/D -- No DPT

#### Best studies disprove the confounding variables their ev cites and empirically confirm our impacts

The **[[democratic peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**---the idea that
democracies rarely fight one another--- has been called "[[the closest
thing]{.mark} we have [to an **empirical law**]{.mark} in the study of
international relations]{.underline}." [Yet, [some contend]{.mark} that
this relationship [is **spurious**]{.mark} and [suggest **alternative
explanations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, in the absence of
randomized experiments, we can never rule out the possible existence of
such confounding biases. Rather than commonly used regression-based
approaches, [we apply a **[nonparametric sensitivity
analysis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We [[show]{.mark} that
**[overturning]{.mark} the negative association** between democracy and
conflict [would **require a confounder**]{.mark} **that is [forty-seven
times more prevalent]{.mark}** in democratic dyads than in other
dyads]{.underline}. To put this number in context, [[the
relationship]{.mark} between democracy and peace [is **at least five
times as robust** as]{.mark} that [between **smoking and**]{.mark}
**lung [cancer]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To explain away the democratic
peace, therefore, scholars would have to find far more powerful
confounders than those already identified in the literature.

The proposition that democratic states do not fight interstate wars
against each other is one of the most enduring and influential ideas in
international relations. The idea is theoretically rooted in the work of
Immanuel Kant, who argued that interactions between states with a
republican form of government give "a favorable prospect for the desired
consequence, i.e., perpetual peace."1 This has led to a large literature
empirically documenting a negative association between democracy and
conflict,2 leading one scholar to comment that the democratic peace is
"the closest thing we have to an empirical law in the study of
international relations."3

[Despite the law-like nature of this association, no scholarly consensus
has emerged on whether the observed association reflects a causal
relationship or a spurious correlation]{.underline}. According to a
recent survey, more than 30 percent of international relations scholars
disagree with the democratic peace theory.4 In particular, [skeptics
have challenged the democratic peace by arguing that **alliance**
structures]{.underline} from the Cold War,5
**[capitalism]{.underline}**,6 [and contract-intensive
**economies**]{.underline}7 confound the observed association. [These
authors find that adding certain **confounding variables** to regression
models **eliminates the statistical significance** of the estimated
coefficient for the joint democracy variable]{.underline}.8

How should we resolve this empirical debate regarding the democratic
peace?9 Unfortunately, in the absence of randomized experiments, we can
never completely rule out the possible existence of confounding biases
that arise from omitted variables. While [[scholars]{.mark} in this
literature have [**exclusively** relied on **parametric regression
models**]{.mark}]{.underline}, this approach requires strong
assumptions, namely that the model accurately characterizes the true
data-generating process (correct set of variables, right functional
form, valid distributional assumption, etc.). Given that these
assumptions may not be verifiable from observed data, [it is no surprise
that various scholars advocate different regression models [with
**diverging**]{.mark} **sets of [variables]{.mark}**, [resulting in
**contradictory findings**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The difficulty of
adjudicating between these alternative modeling approaches has led to
the ongoing controversy in the empirical democratic peace literature.

We propose [an alternative approach based on **nonparametric sensitivity
analysis**]{.underline} to formally assess the robustness of the
empirical evidence.10 Specifically, we [**quantify** the strength of
**confounding relationships** that could explain away the observed
association between democracy and peace]{.underline}. That is, we
compute the precise level of unobserved confounding needed to render the
observed association between democracy and conflict spurious. The idea
is that although not all correlations imply causation, a very strong
correlation suggests it. [Unlike the parametric regression modeling
approach prevalent in the literature, the proposed **[nonparametric
sensitivity]{.mark}** approach **[directly addresses]{.mark}** the
existence of unobserved **[confounders]{.mark}** without assuming a
particular regression model]{.underline}.11 Although one can never know
with certainty from observational data whether democracy causes peace,
[this nonparametric sensitivity analysis can formally assess the
robustness of **empirical evidence** for the democratic
peace]{.underline}.

Our analysis applies the nonparametric sensitivity analysis method
originally developed by Cornfield and colleagues, who were concerned
with the robustness of the positive association between cigarette
smoking and lung cancer in the potential presence of unobserved
confounders.12 The study of the causal relationship between smoking and
lung cancer closely parallels the dispute on the democratic peace. In
both cases, randomized experiments cannot be conducted for ethical and
logistical reasons, and critics contend that the observed association
suffers from confounding biases. While no definitive conclusion can be
drawn from observational data, Cornfield and colleagues argue that no
existing confounder can explain the strong association between smoking
and cancer and therefore this relationship is likely to be causal. Their
conclusion is worth quoting here:

Cigarette smokers have a ninefold greater risk of developing lung cancer
than nonsmokers, while over-two-pack-a-day smokers have at least a
60-fold greater risk. Any characteristic proposed as a measure of the
postulated cause common to both smoking status and lung-cancer risk must
therefore be at least nine-fold more prevalent among cigarette smokers
than among nonsmokers and at least 60-fold more prevalent among
two-pack-a-day smokers. No such characteristic has yet been produced
despite diligent search.13

Our application of nonparametric sensitivity analysis to the democratic
peace yields striking results. Depending on the definition of democracy,
we find that a confounder must be at least forty-seven times more
prevalent in democratic dyads than in other types of dyads. Thus, any
potential confounder that could explain the democratic peace would have
to be at least five times as prevalent as a similar confounder for
smoking and lung cancer. In other words, according to our analysis, [the
positive association between democracy and peace is much more robust
than that between smoking and lung cancer]{.underline}.

While no such confounder has yet been found for the relationship between
smoking and lung cancer, [we examine whether the confounders identified
in the democratic peace literature]{.underline} meet the conditions of
nonparametric sensitivity analysis. [For example, we consider a set of
**[economic]{.mark} confounders** proposed by Gartzke who argues that
the democratic peace can be explained by **capitalism**]{.underline}.14
We [[also]{.mark} consider other confounders, such as **military
[alliances]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 [Overall, our [findings]{.mark}
imply that for a potential confounder to explain away the democratic
peace, it must be much more strongly associated with regime types and
conflicts than the confounders that have been proposed to date. This
finding again [demonstrate]{.mark}s [the **robustness** of **empirical
evidence** for]{.mark} the **[democratic peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Finally, we believe that a nonparametric sensitivity analysis, such as
the one we use here, can play an important role in international
relations research, where the threat of omitted variable bias is almost
always present. Although sensitivity analysis has been applied in
international relations, almost all such applications have been based on
parametric regression models. In the democratic peace literature, Kadera
and Mitchell conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis in the spirit of
Leamer.16 In addition, Chaudoin, Hays, and Hicks apply a parametric
sensitivity analysis of Altonji, Elder, and Taber to the effects of the
GATT/WTO, whereas Hegre and Sambanis use the method of Sala-i-Martin to
examine the sensitivity of empirical results on civil war onset.17 The
only exception we found is Davis and Shirato, who use a nonparametric
sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of their findings to
possible sample selection bias.18 [Unlike parametric approaches,
nonparametric sensitivity analyses avoid modeling assumptions and hence
offer a robust method to examine the strength of empirical
conclusions]{.underline}.

[[Although **democracies** do **better on average** than
**authoritarian** s]{.mark}ystems]{.underline}, climate change is an
issue that poses specific challenges to the governing capacity of
democracy. The challenge of climate change is complex and has sometimes
been described as a 'wicked problem'. It is an issue in the interface
between natural and human systems, and therefore it affects all spheres
of life, but in unpredictable ways. The complexity of climate change is
one of the prime reasons why democracies have failed to deal adequately
with the crisis. [The climate crisis is]{.underline} moreover [a global
challenge, and democracies have not sufficiently managed to act beyond
the constraints of the national states. The **[short-term
focus]{.mark}** of most democratic decision-making has been an
additional weakness]{.underline}. Democracy is a system limited by time
and space, while the problem of climate change runs across generations
and national borders. [Moreover, the influence of fossil fuel
**[lobbyism]{.mark}**, **corruption**, **policy [capture]{.mark}** [and
**weak**]{.mark} **institutional [capacity]{.mark}** [have **hampered
democracies**]{.mark} from acting responsibly]{.underline}.

As this paper demonstrates, [**democracies [nevertheless possess several
advantages]{.mark}** when it comes to tackling the climate crisis.
Governing systems that allow **[civil participation]{.mark}**, a **[free
flow of info]{.mark}**rmation [and processes of **assessment and
evaluation**]{.mark} seem to be [**more capable** than
**authoritarian**]{.mark} **regime[s]{.mark}** [in **dealing
with**]{.mark} **issues of great [complexity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[**[Studies]{.mark}** on climate change cooperation have also
[shown]{.mark} that, [**in general**, **democracies** are **more
active** in **international negotiations** and **more likely** to
**keep**]{.mark} **their political [commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The international cooperation on climate change relies to a great
extent on open and democratic societies, providing a base for
journalists and civil society organizations covering and reporting on
the negotiations and monitoring compliance]{.underline}. [Moreover,
**[tech]{.mark}nological [innovation]{.mark}**, particularly [on
**renewable energy**, has made]{.mark} the [solutions]{.mark} to the
climate crisis less cross-border intensive and extensive, motivating
both individual countries, regions and cities, and companies,
communities and individuals, to act on their own. Active engagement by
individuals and civil society organizations can create pressure for
strong policy responses on a local, national and global
level]{.underline}.

[[**Studies** also show]{.mark} that [**democracies** are
**improving**]{.mark} their performance [on **long-term
policies**]{.mark}---for instance, [on **climate action**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} on the United Nations **[Sustainable
[Development]{.mark}]{.underline}** Goals. [Institutional changes, such
as the adoption of climate legislation and advisory bodies, and
activities within democracies, such as the youth-driven climate movement
and processes of climate litigation, have made them even **[less
vulnerable to short-termism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Despite this,
democracies are still not delivering on their climate
pledges]{.underline}. [In many **fragile democracies**, **corruption**
is obstructing the policymaking process on climate and preventing
adequate and efficient implementation]{.underline}. The fossil fuel
industry still wields substantial influence on politics in several
democratic countries. In this respect, the lack of trustworthy and
independent public institutions, with the ability to counteract policy
capture and corruption, protect human rights, and deliver on the
principles of the rule of law and good governance, is a serious barrier
on the path towards a sustainable future.

[In conclusion, functioning [**democracy is essential** to]{.mark}
effectively [deal with the **climate crisis**]{.mark};
**[however]{.mark}**, as long as [many]{.mark} democracies are
[suffering from]{.mark} their own **[institutional failures]{.mark}**,
they **will not be able deliver** adequately. Consequently, [**efforts**
to]{.mark} develop and **[support democracy around the world need to be
sustained]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but it is also necessary to undertake
certain measures, activities and reforms to make democracy more able to
tackle the climate crisis. The policy advice in this paper focuses on
the necessity to overcome short-termism, ensure citizen participation,
act on climate injustice, develop knowledge-based decision-making and
strengthen the state capacity. Further research on the nexus of
democracy and climate is also needed, to better understand both the
effects climate change could have on democracy as such and how
democratic governance could be developed to become more capable of
dealing with the crisis at hand.

### AT: US Thumps

#### It only demonstrated the [resilience]{.underline} of democracy, does [NOT thump]{.underline}

**Walsh 21** Nate Walsh, Emmy award-winning CNN International Security
Editor, "America was lucky to be saved by its democracy \-- even if some
don\'t realize it," CNN, 1-8-2021,

/GoGreen!

Even in the aftermath, America might not see how fortunate it is.

Most \"attempted coups\" elsewhere in the world leave a hangover of
giddying uncertainty - shops shuttered, presidents in hiding, the
television playing a nature documentary or half the staff in the hotel
you are staying in not turning up for work.

However, [America\'s extraordinary privileges of law and functionality
seemed to sustain, even in a brief moment of collapse]{.underline}.
Wednesday was a six-hour catastrophic policing failure, one that finally
served up an image of what the souring of democracy can look like, after
years of appeasement and detachment by ordinary voters.

Yet [still America woke up to relative order]{.underline}. The system
had overnight thrived persistently - news networks broadcasting and
dissecting the events, with variety and transparency, and the wheels of
vote certification turning, as expected. Americans perhaps also took
that for granted: that they turned on the TV to hear criticism of their
president, that the police and national guard swooped in to enforce the
law, that outrage - not fear at the new unknown - dominated. Chaos
normally follows disorder, but in the United States the cogs kept
whirring.

It\'s been **[[easy to say]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
**[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** version of [[**democracy** was
**irreparably damaged**]{.mark} by Wednesday, January 6.
**[But]{.mark}**, once Moscow, Beijing and Tehran have finished gloating
briefly, remember too the **[signals]{.mark}** that the day
**[sent]{.mark}** about [its **resilience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes,
the United States witnessed a mob of mostly White men breaking into its
Congress, because they felt the law was theirs alone, and because so
many ordinary Americans spent four years thinking the horror was either
too ridiculous to fear, or would just pass. [But in the end, the quieter
majority, not the loudest voice, remained standing]{.underline}. This
short moment of ugly collapse should not lead Americans to dismiss the
extraordinary eloquence and value of their system.

The rioters abused the privileges of their wealthy democracy - their
free lives, in the richest nation on earth - to indulge in a
fantastical, parallel reality, and livestream on open social media their
breaking into the seat of government. It was a spoilt child version of
America - so \"free\" to do whatever it wants, it ignored the truths,
laws and decency that actually enabled that freedom. [Elsewhere
globally, scenes like these normally follow actual tyranny and absurd
vote-rigging, palpable repression and torture - not fictional complaints
that have had their (multiple) days in court]{.underline}.

Wednesday\'s violence didn\'t really fit the conventional description of
an \"attempted coup\" - normally a word evoked when the military or
security forces help change who\'s in power. \"Coup\" became part of the
day\'s hurried lexicon perhaps as what was happening was so alien and
unimaginable - in a capital city so absorbed with the infallibility of
its processes, that it didn\'t really have the vocabulary for this
violence. But the less-privileged former Soviet Union - where even
slight gasps of freedom have been very hard won - can offer comparisons
as plentifully as Eskimos are said to have words for snow.

This wasn\'t a \"colored revolution\" - like the \"Orange\" one in
Ukraine in 2004, where hundreds of thousands of patient protestors stood
in the cold for months to successfully reverse a blatantly fraudulent
election. It wasn\'t the \"Tulip\" one of Kyrgyzstan in 2005, when
protesters - some on horseback, also angry at a patently rigged vote -
fought their way into the presidential administration, drank its liquor,
rode on its exercise bikes, all while armed security forces were
unwilling to open fire.

It was uglier. It reminded me most of Ukraine in 2014, when an organized
group of pro-Russian protesters forced their way into the local
administrations of Donetsk and Slovyansk. The \"Q-Shaman\" would have
fit right in that mob too. These brief, drunken moments of violence and
shouting were the sparks that ignited a civil war which killed
thousands. The media was also attacked then by the crowd, fired up by
incendiary broadcasting from Russian state-media available in the east
of the Ukraine. Crimea had earlier been invaded. It was a clockwork plan
for occupation by Moscow.

But [when you woke up each morning in Donetsk, the system continued to
fall apart. In]{.underline} Washington [DC, the opposite was
true]{.underline}. [[The **system**]{.underline}]{.mark} is busying
itself with **[[rectifying the problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
extraordinary privileges Americans live with daily - and that perversely
led a handful to think the armed invasion of Capitol Hill was OK - were
still there.

[The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates\' [[**allies** and **enemies**]{.mark}
will [globally chew]{.mark} on this moment - for signs that it foments
China\'s rise, or gives Putin another decade in power]{.underline}, or
makes Maduro seem comparatively competent.
**[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}** remember, between horror at what a sense
of privilege among a small mob can do, [there is **also** a moment of
hope. **[Values worked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Unlike elsewhere in the
past decades, [the departing President\'s supporters did not take
over]{.underline} parliament and change the government. [The army did
not switch sides]{.underline}. The rightful winner of the last election
is not in hiding - he broadcast a speech, and will be president in
several days. Two members of the slavishly loyal cabinet resigned.

Trump has done damage to democracy\'s reputation globally in ways I
never imagined I would see. President-elect Joe [Biden is right to say
it is \"**fragile**.\" It is **also**]{.underline} precious, and
**[effective]{.underline}**. For now, it worked. [[**Trump** and]{.mark}
the **[domestic terrorism]{.mark}** he fomented [were]{.mark} - in this
moment - **[defeated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There turned out to be
enduring values at the heart of even some of the most compromised
American elected officials. [[That is **not a global
norm**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Now is not a time for chest-thumping over American values that have
slowly deteriorated for years to get to this point. But it should also
not lead a country to be so spoiled in its own privileged system that it
dismisses its extraordinary merits altogether. [**[Democracy didn\'t
fail]{.mark}** the United States, [it]{.mark} pretty much
**[saved]{.mark} it**]{.underline}.

[The **singular reason** the **US system has advantages over its
authoritarian rivals** is that it is based on]{.underline} the **[open
competition]{.underline}** and truth of ideas. The morning after this
failed coup, the United States didn\'t wake up to a nature documentary
on state TV, or find half the hotel staff missing, but was alive with a
renewed vigor of self-criticism in rolling news coverage.

They should be mindful of how they might appear to those who woke up
that morning in actual tyrannies: Many perhaps taking for granted how
lucky they are to live in a nation where [such a staggering **[abuse of
democracy]{.mark}**]{.underline} can **[[still]{.underline}]{.mark}** be
**[[eclipsed by its virtues]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[In the wake of Kabul's collapse, experts and government officials need
to answer a pivotal question: why did the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [**fail** to build a more effective **[Afghan
military]{.mark}**?]{.underline} In its misguided focus on training and
equipping, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**[failed]{.mark}** to **prioritize** a **results-based
approach**]{.underline}. [[To **avoid a similar fate** with **other
counterterrorism training missions**]{.mark}, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**[needs to invest in]{.mark}** and empower
**[a]{.mark}ssessment, [m]{.mark}onitoring, [and
e]{.mark}valuation**]{.underline}.

Since 2001, as part of U.S. counterterrorism planning in Afghanistan,
successive American administrations have prioritized building the Afghan
National Security Forces (ANSF) to take over the counterterrorism
mission and facilitate a measured withdrawal of American forces. But
[the U.S. military's approach was flawed from the start. The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [never conducted an assessment
to determine the type of military Afghanistan needed given its human
capital, geography, and adversary. Its approach failed to identify clear
metrics for building such a force, establish a systematic monitoring and
evaluation mechanism, and adequately analyze how Afghan security forces
would hold up in direct action against Taliban fighters]{.underline}.
[These gaps in analysis were laid bare when Afghan security forces
**completely fell apart** in the face of Taliban fighters, **only four
months after**]{.underline} President Joe [Biden announced]{.underline}
the U.S. **[withdrawal]{.underline}**.

Twenty years later, despite the United States' \$83 billion investment
in the ANSF, security in Afghanistan has progressively worsened: the
Taliban controls more territory than at any point in the war, the number
of effective enemy-initiated attacks has steadily increased, and fear
for personal safety among Afghans has never been higher.

The United States dedicated a significant amount of money, time, and
attention to implementing training and equipping units, while less than
one percent went to collecting the most valuable information -- how the
effectiveness of soldier and unit performance changed as a result of the
training.

Mission Failure: The Reconstitution of the ANSF

Capacity building is extremely challenging in conflict zones where staff
turn over rapidly, no single U.S. agency is in the lead, and chronic
insecurity makes measuring success difficult. Afghanistan presented the
added difficulty of conducting capacity building during active combat
while dealing with the challenges of coordinating the efforts of an
international coalition. Persistent insecurity severely undermined
reconstruction efforts, forcing the United States and NATO to
continuously substitute for the capacity and capability of the ANSF,
which often detracted from the capacity building mission as well as the
accompanying efforts to monitor and evaluate it.

There were many flaws in the way the United States measured the
effectiveness of its efforts. [While the U.S. Defense Department (DOD)
is required by law to conduct assessment, monitoring, and evaluation of
its capacity building programs, whether this is carried out and the
quality of those efforts is not always guaranteed]{.underline}.
[**Standardized methods** to measure results **did not exist** in
Afghanistan]{.underline}. During the 20-year effort, operational
assessments from top U.S. military leaders exhibited entrenched
optimism, which "bore no resemblance" to conditions on the ground.

[In seeking to evaluate the ANSF, **DOD changed assessment
methodologies** at least **four times**, resulting in varied, often
**contradictory conclusions** about the quality and readiness of the
forces]{.underline}. [As a result, reporting tended to **elevate good
news** and success stories over data suggesting a lack of
progress]{.underline}. Criticism of the various assessment mechanisms
included: a paucity of personnel able to execute the assessments and
verify reported data, poor quality of the data collected, and improper
metrics that assessed program progress (dollars spent, equipment
provided, soldiers trained) rather than longer-term effects (battlefield
performance, leadership, corruption).

The Writing on the Wall

In 2008, Congress created the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan
Reconstruction (SIGAR) to provide quarterly reports to Congress and
ensure independent oversight over the entirety of U.S. reconstruction
efforts. In late 2014, at the urging of former military and civilian
leadership serving in Afghanistan, SIGAR began publishing lessons
learned reports to capture the progress and challenges.

SIGAR reports repeatedly expressed skepticism of the ANSF's capacity to
provide its own security and maintain facilities and equipment provided
by DOD. In March 2014, General Joseph Dunford presciently warned the
Senate Armed Services Committee that if the coalition troop withdrew at
the end of the year, the "\[Afghan security forces\] will begin to
deteriorate. The security environment will begin to deteriorate, and I
think the only debate is the pace of that deterioration." In 2018,
then-Afghan President Ashraf Ghani estimated his army would not last six
months without American "support" and "capabilities." In its most recent
assessment in March 2021, SIGAR concluded that the ANSF could neither
protect the population from insurgents in large parts of the country,
nor could it maintain equipment, manage supply chains, or train new
soldiers, pilots, and policemen; the ANSF was "nowhere near" achieving
self-sufficiency.

Beyond Afghanistan

[This **[broken process]{.mark}** didn't manifest just in Afghanistan --
it [**persists** across]{.mark} U.S. **[counterterrorism]{.mark}**
programs **[globally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In Iraq, fewer than 1,000
fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) launched a
surprise attack on Mosul in 2014. In response, four of 14 Iraqi army
divisions -- military forces that the United States spent years
training, arming, and equipping -- rapidly crumbled. Approximately
30,000 soldiers dropped their weapons, shed their uniforms for civilian
clothes, and blended in with the fleeing masses. No one predicted that
Iraqi security forces would disintegrate when facing a few thousand
militants.

[In addition to major counterterrorism capacity building efforts in
**Afghanistan** and **Iraq**, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is involved in training and equipping programs
[in]{.mark} approximately **[80 countries]{.mark}** throughout
**Africa**, **Asia**, and the **Mid**dle **East**]{.underline}. [[Based
on]{.underline}]{.mark} my [[**interviews** and]{.underline}]{.mark}
forthcoming **[[research]{.underline}]{.mark}** experience, [in each of
these cases, the U.S. government is [**not** making **results-based
decisions**]{.mark} on training mission effectiveness]{.underline}.

[There is also a **[growing]{.mark}** body of academic
**[research]{.mark}** that **[links military assistance to
increased]{.mark} terrorist activity**]{.underline}. The [provision of
military assistance has been associated in some cases with **increases**
in terrorist **[attacks]{.mark}**, **fatalities** and
**[casualties]{.mark}**, and **[support]{.mark}** for terrorist groups,
as well as **[longer]{.mark} terrorist [campaigns]{.mark}** [and
**disincentivizing partner**]{.mark} **countrie[s]{.mark}** from
disarming terrorist groups]{.underline}.

Mali, for example, has received significant U.S. military
counterterrorism assistance since 9/11, yet Malian security forces
collapsed when faced with a terrorist and separatist onslaught in 2012.
Shortly thereafter, the military launched a coup that displaced the
democratically elected government. Since then, two more coups have
occurred, each led by the former U.S.-trained commander of Mali's
counterterrorism unit, Assimi Goita, who has since become the nation's
president.

Adaptation Drives Effectiveness

[In each of these cases, the United States has **failed to leverage**
existing assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (**AM&E**) practices to
**better understand** both **intended** and **unintended
consequences**]{.underline}. The U.S. military lacks process and
prioritization for measuring capacity building effectiveness. Using the
military decision-making process to plan and execute, the DOD tends to
view its mission as linear and finite. By contrast, the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) manages programs that are cyclical and
ongoing. To ensure efficacy, USAID's program cycle seeks to plan,
deliver, assess, and adapt its assistance. The critical difference is in
the final step: DOD focuses on executing the order, while USAID
incorporates the results of its AM&E to improve program efficacy.

Congress took a monumental step forward in reforming how DOD conducts
and manages its security cooperation efforts in the enacted FY2017
National Defense and Authorization Act (NDAA). The NDAA dramatically
increased congressional oversight by mandating the assessment,
monitoring and evaluation of security capacity building programs.
Because of DOD's lengthy planning process, however, tangible changes
will not be realized for several years.

The FY2017 NDAA also included a crucial development: the creation of an
in-house AM&E workforce at DOD. The Defense Security Cooperation
University was founded in September 2019, to uphold a common knowledge
base across the workforce, mandate common professional standards through
a required multi-tier certificate program, and prioritize continued
intellectual development. To further bolster this in-house AM&E
workforce and minimize dependence on third-party contractors, the NDAA
mandated the establishment of teams dedicated to AM&E within the Office
of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation,
the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and within each Geographic
Combatant Command.

Investing in Results

[To build another country's capacity to counter terrorism, the United
States **must improve** its own competence to **assess, monitor, and
evaluate** training programs]{.underline}. [**DOD** should **further
invest**]{.underline} in three crucial areas.

First, DOD needs a culture that empowers its workforce to go beyond
reporting. Promotions should be contingent upon leveraging AM&E to
improve program performance, rather than upon who manages the most
expensive programs. The change toward results-based learning needs to
cascade from the top down -- specifically, the Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation should be appropriately
staffed and resourced to ensure programs institute and empower DOD's
AM&E requirements. The agency-wide perception that program evaluation is
used as a punitive tool leading to budget cuts or other adverse
repercussions needs to shift -- no evaluation finding should be viewed
as negative, but rather should be viewed as guidance for course
correction.

Second, [[**DOD** needs to **prioritize**]{.mark} rigorous program
design. DOD should place emphasis on a thorough upfront
**[assessment]{.mark}**, during which program planners
analyze]{.underline} the situation on the ground and assess a partner
nation's needs. If these components are properly captured, the program
will identify more realistic goals [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} have a
better, smarter design. [In addition, DOD has faced criticism for not
**prioritizing** impact **[evaluation]{.mark}**. Measuring program
outcomes is critical to identifying whether a given program has achieved
its desired effects. By identifying successful programs, DOD can focus
on **adapting, replicating, and testing those programs
elsewhere**]{.underline}.

Third, DOD needs a robust yet flexible feedback loop for its programs.
Leadership needs to underscore the importance of iterative learning;
however, the current 5-year planning cycle and congressional
notification system do not afford required flexibility. In late 2021,
planning is in full swing for FY2023 programs. Once in motion, the
system does not allow for change even though a lot can happen in three
years that could warrant adjustment. Furthermore, while DOD should
continue investing in independent research on how to improve assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation of security cooperation and capacity building
programs, it should also incorporate findings from the growing field of
academic research in this area that already exists.

[Without a fundamental shift towards accountability, other recipients of
U.S. military assistance stand to suffer Afghanistan's
fate]{.underline}. We should always have an answer to the question:
"What did we accomplish?"

Catalytic nuclear attack [**[Catalytic nuclear attack]{.mark}** is a
metaphor for the]{.underline} possible [malevolent third party who sets
out to **induce a nuclear war** between]{.underline} two other [nuclear
weapons states]{.underline}. It is based on a metaphor drawn from
chemistry whereby a catalyst increases the rate of chemical reaction
without catalyst itself being destroyed. Tiny amounts of a catalyst
often suffice to bring about such a transformative effect. Such a
"catalytic" nuclear attack between nuclear weapons states was a serious
policy concern in the nineteen-fifties in the United States where
strategists were seized of the notion that a "small" nuclear weapons
state (for which read "China") could start a nuclear war between the
United States and the former Soviet Union (FSU). As articulated by the
ubiquitous Herman Kahn, the concern was that the small "catalytic" state
instigating the conflict would be the least damaged at the end of a
nuclear war, and could increase its relative power by starting a war
between other nuclear armed states that resulted in their catastrophic
destruction. In his classic essay outlining this argument, Donald Kobe
derived what he termed to be suspicion, retaliation, destruction,
catalytic war utility, and casualty matrices for each country that
defined outcomes for each state in a "catalytic nuclear war."\[2\] As
China began to test its own nuclear weapons and the United States and
the FSU began to anticipate its deployment in the sixties, the ability
of the two nuclear superpowers, even at this relatively early stage in
their rapidly growing nuclear forces, to overwhelmingly retaliate and
damage the catalytic state soon allayed this concern. Nonetheless, the
concept motivated these two nuclear armed states to strive for nuclear
non-proliferation, in part driven by their mutual fear of
state-sponsored nuclear terrorism should nuclear weapons and nuclear
weapons technology and materials become freely available---a concern
that persisted over the subsequent decades.\[3\] Is catalytic nuclear
terrorism still a serious policy concern? Today, the notion of
"catalytic" nuclear war seems archaic in certain respects, and reflected
a dismissive view at the time in the United States of the rationality of
a state leadership armed with nuclear weapons and facing an overwhelming
external adversary---in the case of China, not just one, but soon to be
two external nuclear enemies that targeted its cities and nuclear
forces. As China's minimum deterrent posture evolved, and as its nuclear
threat rhetoric subsided with the end of the Cultural Revolution, so the
fear of catalytic nuclear war also receded. However, the fear of a
catalytic nuclear war returned with a vengeance at the end of the Cold
War when multiple states found themselves nuclear-armed almost overnight
due to the collapse of the former Soviet Union, or proliferated
independent nuclear forces in rapid succession in South Asia and in slow
motion, North Korea. In the United States and Russia, formal and
informal discussion of the importance of avoiding war and nuclear war
due to third party nuclear attack, by state or non-state actors, took
place in diplomatic, military, and private channels, driven in part by
the risk of nuclear "mega-terrorism" as the efforts of various
insurgencies and global terrorist networks to acquire and use nuclear
weapons came to light. [The continued salience of the concept of
catalytic nuclear war rests on three nested arguments]{.underline}. The
[first]{.underline} is that [inadvertent nuclear war is
possible]{.underline}, that is, the [**probability** is **greater than
zero** albeit unknowable. **Multiple "threshold" events**]{.underline}
that **[could trigger inadvertent nuclear war]{.underline}** are
conceivable. In some unknowable combination, such drivers contribute to
a probability greater than zero that nuclear war between states will
occur, variously estimated at 0.1-1 percent year by strategic
analysts---although there is no objective basis for such estimates,
simply subjective estimates buttressed by the perception that specific
near-nuclear wars punctuated the Cold War and post-Cold War decades, at
which time the probability was perceived to be much higher for months at
a time. The [second]{.underline} is that [of all the drivers of
inadvertent war, state-supported and non-state nuclear terrorism may be
the least "directly controllable" by nuclear weapons
states]{.underline}. Moreover, [such nuclear terrorist attacks may
coincide in the future with the influence of other drivers that could
trigger **rapid escalation** to nuclear first use in conditions of
complex nuclear confrontation]{.underline} involving two or more nuclear
weapons states. Thus, [the non-state terrorist driver of nuclear war may
**[render "normal"]{.mark} positive and negative [controls]{.mark} on
nuclear use [far less stabilizing]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} in [the
past]{.mark}]{.underline} when states were the sole concern in nuclear
confrontations, depending on how a terrorist nuclear attack might affect
the various contributing pathways to inadvertent nuclear war (listed in
the next section). The [third]{.underline} is that such [**nuclear
[terrorist attacks]{.mark}** [may]{.mark} take many forms]{.underline},
as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Types of Nuclear Terrorism from Least to
Most Damaging • Credible Threats of Nuclear Terrorism • Hostage Taking •
[Steal, Smuggle, Acquire Radioactive Material for **Dirty
Bomb**]{.underline} • [Steal, Smuggle, [Acquire]{.mark}]{.underline}

Fuel]{.mark}**]{.underline} • [Simultaneous **Cyber Attacks** Disable
**[Critical Infrastructure]{.mark}** Leading to Mass Casualties
[or]{.mark} to Enable Nuclear Terrorism]{.underline} • [[Acquire
**Nuclear Weapon**]{.underline}]{.mark}; Detonate Nuclear Weapon Notes
to Figure 1: a credible threat not accompanied by one or more actions to
realize the threat is the least damage act of terrorism, and rests on
the perception of those threatened as to the perpetrator's intention and
capability. [Many nuclear terrorism threats are made. Relatively few are
credible]{.underline}. The types below "mere" threats are characterized
by actions which may (or may not) have been preceded by credible
threats. "Footloose" here is shorthand for loss of control of legitimate
and authorized control entity, public or private, that is subject to
diversion and seizure by a non-state entity. Cyber attacks may be part
of the types of nuclear terrorism because a competent terrorist entity
will employ cyberattacks as part of a nuclear terrorist attack. However,
a cyber attack that disables critical infrastructure at the same time as
another type of direct nuclear terrorist attack is conducted would be
highly damaging and if it results of itself in mass casualties, may
enable and amplify the consequences of dirty bomb or an actual nuclear
detonation. In this sense, [a cyber attack may be a cyber-**multiplier**
for other types of nuclear terrorism]{.underline}. Of course, [a **cyber
attack** aimed at **mass casualties** and terrorist effects may be
undertaken **without any form of nuclear terrorism** associated with
it]{.underline}. Finally, acquisition of radioactive materials or
fissile material may occur via theft, purchase, or self-manufacture (the
least likely and most difficult of the three acquisition pathways). Some
may argue that radiological weapons (dirty bombs) are not nuclear at all
in that they do not involve criticality at all, just the radioactive
properties of the materials, and may be relatively crude and low
technology. However, some nuclear weapons aim to achieve precisely such
radiological effects on varying scales and long-term radiological
effects, rather than blast and other direct irradiation of targeted
humans. Dirty bombs and nuclear bombs exist on a spectrum and where
competent, malevolent, and motivated non-state actors might position
themselves on that spectrum remains an open question. \*\*\* These many
types of terrorist nuclear attack present states with starkly different
potential damage, greater possible ambiguity or even opacity in terms of
precursor indicators as well as identity of the perpetrator. [**Any** of
these types of attack may affect nuclear-armed states in
**unpredictable** ways with respect to their own nuclear use decisions
at times when inter-state conflict may be more or less
likely]{.underline}. These various types of attack by non-state actors
reduce into three basic categories of threat and use, as follows:
Credible threat of either nuclear detonation or radiological attack with
possible massive damages Actual or sub-critical nuclear detonation
Actual spent fuel or reactor attack with substantial radiological
release. In turn, such categories of terrorist attack might be realized
in or against one or more types of targeted state, viz, a nuclear armed
state, a nuclear umbrella state that receives nuclear extended
deterrence from a nuclear armed state, or a non-nuclear weapons state
which may or may not have nuclear fuel cycle facilities in and/or
fissile material stored on its territory. (Thus, the target may or may
not be a state, a state agency, or a state facility---it might be a
civilian target such as a company or a religious entity; but in this
paper, all terrorist nuclear attacks are assumed to take place only in
places controlled by functioning states). Nuclear terrorism post-cold
war: trigger for inadvertent nuclear war? [The possible catalytic effect
of nuclear terrorism on the risk of state-based nuclear war is not a
simple linkage. The multiple types and scales of nuclear terrorism may
affect state-nuclear use decisions along **multiple pathways** that lead
to **inadvertent nuclear war**. These include]{.underline}: [Early
warning systems fail or are "tripped" in ways that lead to
**launch-on-warning**]{.underline} Accidental nuclear detonation,
including sub-critical explosions. [Strategic **miscalc**ulation **in
crisis**]{.underline}, show of force [Decision-making failure (such as
irrational, misperception, bias, degraded, group, and time-compressed
decision-making) **Allied** or **enemy** choices (to seek revenge, to
**exploit nuclear risk**]{.underline}, to act out of desperation)
[Organizational cybernetics whereby a nuclear command-control-and
communications (**NC3**) system generates **error**]{.underline},
including the interplay of national NC3 systems in what may be termed
the meta-NC3 system. [Synchronous and coincident combinations of
above]{.underline}.\[4\] Exactly how, where, and when nuclear terrorism
may "ambush" nuclear armed states already heading for or on such a path
to inadvertent nuclear war depends on who is targeting whom at a given
time, either immediately due to high tension, or generally due to a
structural conflict between states. Nuclear armed states today form a
complex set of global threat relationships that are not distributed
uniformly across the face of Earth. Rather, based on sheer firepower and
reach, the nine nuclear weapons states form a global hierarchy with at
least four tiers, viz: Tier 1: United States, clear technological
supremacy and qualitative edge. Tier 2: Russia, China, global nuclear
powers and peers with the United States due to the unique destructive
power of even relatively small nuclear arsenals, combined with global
reach of missile and bomber delivery systems, thereby constituting a
two-tiered global "nuclear triangle" with the United States. Tier 3:
France, UK, NATO nuclear sharing and delivery NATO members (Belgium,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey) and the NATO and Pacific
nuclear umbrella states (Japan, South Korea, Australia) that depend on
American nuclear extended deterrence and directly and indirectly support
US and US-allied nuclear operations even though they do not host nor
deliver nuclear weapons themselves. Tier 4: India, Pakistan, Israel,
DPRK. The first two tiers constitute the global nuclear threat triangle
that exists between the United States, Russia, and China, forming a
global nuclear "truel." Each of these states targets the others; each
represents an existential threat to the other; and each has a long
history of mutual nuclear threat that is now a core element of their
strategic identity. Tier three consists of states with their own nuclear
force but integrated with that of the United States (even France!) that
expand the zone of mutual nuclear threat over much of the northern and
even parts of the southern hemisphere; and states that host American
nuclear command, control, communications, and intelligence systems that
support US nuclear operations and to whom nuclear deterrence is
"extended" (if, for example, Australia's claim to having an American
nuclear umbrella is believed). The fourth tier is composed of smaller
nuclear forces with a primarily regional reach and focus. Between most
of these nuclear armed states and across the tiers, there are few shared
"rules of the road." The more of these states that are engaged in a
specific conflict and location, the more unpredictable and unstable this
global nuclear threat system becomes, with the potential for cascading
and concatenating effects. Indeed, as the number of nuclear states
projecting nuclear threat against each other increases, the notion of
strategic stability may lose all meaning. The emergence of a fifth
tier---of [**non-state actors** with the capacity to project nuclear
threat against nuclear-armed and nuclear umbrella states]{.underline}
(although not only these states)---[is a critically important possible
catalytic actor in the new conditions of nuclear threat complexity that
already exist today]{.underline}. Such a layer [represents an "edge of
chaos" where the attempts by nuclear armed states to exert absolute
"vertical" control over the use of nuclear weapons confront the
potential of non-state entities and even individuals (insiders) to
engage in "horizontal" nuclear terrorism]{.underline}, presenting
radically different control imperatives to the standard paradigm of
organizational procedures, technical measures, and safeguards of various
kinds. This tier is like the waves and tides on a beach that quickly
surrounds and then causes sand castles to collapse. In 2010, [Robert
Ayson reviewed the potential linkages between inter-state nuclear war
and non-state terrorism]{.underline}. He [concluded]{.underline}:
"...\[T\]hese two nuclear worlds---a non-state actor nuclear attack and
a catastrophic interstate nuclear exchange---are not necessarily
separable. It is just possible that [some sort of terrorist attack, and
especially an act of nuclear terrorism, could precipitate a chain of
events leading to a massive exchange of nuclear weapons]{.underline}
between two or more of the states that possess them."\[5\] How this
linkage might unfold is the subject of the next sections of this essay.
Are non-state actors motivated and able to attempt nuclear terrorism? A
diverse set of non-state actors have engaged in terrorist
activities---for which there is no simple or consensual definition. [In
2011, there were more than 6,900 known extremist, terrorist and other
organizations associated with guerrilla warfare, political
violence]{.underline}, protest, [**organized crime** and
cyber-crime]{.underline}. Of these, about 120 terrorist and extremist
groups had been blacklisted by the United Nations, the European Union
and six major countries.\[6\] [**Some have argued** that the
**technical**, **organizational**, and **funding** demanded for a
successful nuclear attack, especially involving nuclear weapons,
**exceeds** the **capacity** of most of the non-state actors with
terrorist proclivities. Unfortunately, this assertion is **not true**,
especially at lower levels of impact]{.underline} as shown in Figure 1;
[but even at the highest levels of obtaining authentic nuclear weapons
capabilities, a small number of **non-state actors already exhibit** the
**motivation** and possible **capacity** to become
nuclear-armed]{.underline}. Ellingsen suggests a useful distinction that
nuclear terrorists may be impelled by two divergent motivations, as
shown in Figure 2, creating "opportunistic" and "patient" profiles.\[7\]
The requirements for an opportunist non-state nuclear terrorist tend
towards immediate use and the search for short-term payoffs with only
tactical levels of commitment; whereas the patient non-state nuclear
terrorist is able and willing to sustain a long-term acquisition effort
to deal a strategic blow to an adversary in a manner that could be
achieved only with nuclear weapons. \[FIGURE 2 OMITTED\] In turn, many
factors will drive how a potential nuclear terrorist non-state
organization that obtains nuclear weapons or materials may seek to
employ them, especially in its nuclear command-and-control orientations.
Blair and Ackerman suggest that the goals, conditions, and capacity
limitations that shape a possible nuclear terrorist's posture lead
logically to three types of nuclear terrorist nuclear
command-and-control postures, viz: pre-determined (in which the
leadership sends a fire order to a nuclear-armed subordinate and no
change is entertained and no capacity to effect change is established in
the field, that is, the order is fire-and-forget); assertive (in which
only the central command can issue a nuclear fire order, central control
is maintained at all times, with resulting demanding communications
systems to support such control); and delegative (in which lower level
commanders control nuclear weapons and have pre-delegated authority to
use them in defined circumstances, for example, evidence of nuclear
explosions combined with loss-of-connectivity with their central
command).\[8\] An example of such delegative control system was the
November 26, 2008 attack on Mumbai that used social media reporting to
enable the attacking terrorists to respond to distant controller
direction and to adapt to counter-terrorist attacks---a connectivity
tactic that the authorities were too slow to shut down before mayhem was
achieved.\[9\] Logically, one might expect nuclear terrorists oriented
toward short-term, tactical goals to employ pre-determined nuclear
command-and-control strategies in the hope that the speed of attack and
minimum field communications avoids discovery and interdiction before
the attack is complete; whereas nuclear terrorists oriented toward
long-term, strategic goals might employ more pre-delegative
command-and-control systems that would support a bargaining use and
therefore a field capacity to deploy nuclear weapons or materials that
can calibrate actual attack based on communications with the central
leadership with the risk of interdiction through surveillance and
counter-attack. These differing strategic motivations, timelines, and
strategies in many respects invert those of nuclear weapons states that
rely on large organizations, procedures, and technical controls, to
ensure that nuclear weapons are never used without legitimate
authorization; and if they are used, to minimize needless civilian
casualties (at least some nuclear armed states aspire to this outcome).
The repertoire of state-based practices that presents other states with
credible nuclear threat and reassures them that nuclear weapons are
secure and controlled is likely to be completely mismatched with the
strengths and strategies of non-state nuclear terrorists that may seek
to maximize civilian terror, are not always concerned about their own
survival or even that of their families and communities-of-origin, and
may be willing to take extraordinary risk combined with creativity to
exploit the opportunities for attack presented by nuclear weapons,
umbrella, and non-nuclear states, or their private adversaries. For
non-state actors to succeed at complex engineering project such as
acquiring a nuclear weapons or nuclear threat capacity demands
substantial effort. Gary Ackerman specifies that to have a chance of
succeeding, non-state actors with nuclear weapons aspirations must be
able to demonstrate that they control substantial resources, have a safe
haven in which to conduct research and development, have their own or
procured expertise, are able to learn from failing and have the stamina
and strategic commitment to do so, and manifest long-term planning and
ability to make rational choices on decadal timelines. He identified
five such violent non-state actors who already conducted such
engineering projects (see Figure 3), and also noted the important
facilitating condition of a global network of expertize and hardware.
Thus, although the skill, financial, and materiel requirements of a
non-state nuclear weapons project present a high bar, they are certainly
reachable. \[FIGURE 3 OMITTED\] Along similar lines, James Forest
examined the extent to which non-state actors can pose a threat of
nuclear terrorism.\[10\] He notes that such entities face practical
constraints, including expense, the obstacles to stealing many essential
elements for nuclear weapons, the risk of discovery, and the
difficulties of constructing and concealing such weapons. He also
recognizes the strategic constraints that work against obtaining nuclear
weapons, including a cost-benefit analysis, possible de-legitimation
that might follow from perceived genocidal intent or use, and the
primacy of political-ideological objectives over long-term projects that
might lead to the group's elimination, the availability of cheaper and
more effective alternatives that would be foregone by pursuit of nuclear
weapons, and the risk of failure and/or discovery before successful
acquisition and use occurs. In the past, almost all---but not
all---non-state terrorist groups appeared to be restrained by a
combination of high practical and strategic constraints, plus their own
cost-benefit analysis of the opportunity costs of pursuing nuclear
weapons. However, should some or all of these constraints diminish, a
rapid non-state nuclear proliferation is possible. [Although only a few
non-state actors such as **Al Qaeda** and **Islamic State** have
exhibited such underlying stamina and organizational capacities and
**actually attempted to obtain nuclear weapons-related skills, hardware,
and materials**, the past is not prologue]{.underline}. [An incredibly
diverse set of variously **motivated** terrorist groups exist already,
including politico-ideological, apocalyptic-millenarian,
politico-religious, nationalist-separatist, ecological, and
political-insurgency entities, some of which converge with
**criminal-military** and **criminal-scientist** (profit based)
networks; but also pyscho-pathological mass killing cults, lone wolves,
and ephemeral copy-cat non-state actors. The social, economic, and
deculturating conditions that generate such entities are likely to
persist and even expand]{.underline}. In particular, rapidly growing
coastal mega-cities as part of rapid global urbanization offer such
actors the ability to sustain themselves as "flow gatekeepers," possibly
[in alliance with **global criminal networks**, thereby supplanting the
highland origins of many of today's non-state violent actors with global
reach]{.underline}.\[11\] [Other contributing factors contributing to
the supply of possible non-state actors seeking nuclear weapons include
new entries such as city states in search of new security strategies,
megacities creating their own transnationally active security forces,
non-states with partial or complete territorial control such as Taiwan
and various micro-states, failing states, provinces in dissociating,
failing states that fall victim to internal chaos and the displacement
effects of untrammeled globalization, and altogether failed states
resulting in ungoverned spaces. To this must be added domestic terrorist
entities in the advanced industrial states]{.underline} as they hollow
out their economies due to economic globalization and restructuring,
adjust to cross-border migration, and adapt to cultural and political
dislocation. In short, the prognosis is for the fifth tier of non-state
actors to beset the other four tiers with intense turbulence just as
waves on a beach swirl around sandcastles, washing away their
foundations, causing grains of sand to cascade, and eventually
collapsing the whole structure. Observed non-state nuclear threats and
attacks [In light of the constraints faced by non-state terrorist actors
in past decades, it is not surprising that the constellation of actual
nuclear terrorist attacks and threats has been relatively
limited]{.underline} during and since the end of the Cold War. As Martha
Crenshaw noted in a comment on the draft of this paper: We still don't
know why terrorists (in the sense of non-state actors) have not moved
into the CBRN \[chemical,biological, radiological or nuclear \] domain.
(Many people think biosecurity is more critical, for that matter.) Such
a move would be extremely risky for the terrorist actor, even if the
group possessed both capability (resources, secure space, time,
patience) and motivation (willingness to expend the effort, considering
opportunity costs). So far it appears that "conventional" terrorism
serves their purposes well enough. Most of what we have seen is
rhetoric, with some scattered and not always energetic
initiatives.\[12\] [Nonetheless, those that **have occurred**
demonstrate unambiguously that such threats and attacks are **not merely
hypothetical**, in spite of the limiting conditions outlined
above]{.underline}. [One survey [documented **eighty**]{.mark} **actual,
[planned attacks]{.mark}** on nuclear facilities containing nuclear
materials between 1961-2016]{.underline}\[13\] as follows: 80 attacks in
3 waves (1970s armed assaults, 1990s thefts, post-2010, breaches) High
threat attacks: 32/80 attacks posed substantial, verified threat of
which 44 percent involved insiders. [All types of targets were found in
the data set---on reactors, other nuclear facilities, military
bases]{.underline} leading Gary Ackerman and to conclude: "[Overall,
**empirical evidence** suggests that there are sufficient cases in each
of the listed categories that no type of threat can be
ignored]{.underline}."\[14\] [No region was immune; no year was without
such a threat or attack]{.underline}. Thus, [there is a likely to be a
coincidence of future non-state threats and attacks with inter-state
nuclear-prone conflicts, as in the past, and possibly more so given the
current trend in and the generative conditions for global terrorist
activity that will likely pertain in the coming decades]{.underline}. Of
these attacks, about a quarter each were ethno-nationalist, secular
utopian, or unknown in motivation; and the remaining quarter were a
motley mix of religious (11 percent), "other" (5 percent),
personal-idiosyncratic (4 percent), single issue (2 percent) and state
sponsored (1 percent) in motivation. [The conclusion is unavoidable
that]{.underline} there [a non-state nuclear terrorist
attack]{.underline} in the Northeast Asia region [is
possible]{.underline}. The following sections outline the possible
situations in which nuclear terrorist attacks might be implicated as a
trigger to interstate conflict, and even nuclear war. Particular
attention is paid to the how [nuclear command, control and
communications systems may play an independent and unanticipated role in
leading to inadvertent nuclear war, separate to the contributors to
inadvertency normally included such as degradation of decision-making
due to time and other pressures; accident; "wetware" (human failures),
software or hardware failures; and misinterpretation of intended or
unintended signals from an adversary]{.underline}. Regional pathways to
interstate nuclear war [At least five distinct nuclear-prone axes of
conflict are evident in]{.underline} Northeast Asia. These are:
[**US-DPRK** conflict]{.underline} (including with United States, US
allies Japan, South Korea and Australia; and all other UNC command
allies. Many permutations possible ranging from non-violent collapse to
implosion and civil war, inter-Korean war, slow humanitarian crisis. Of
these implosion-civil war in the DPRK may be the most dangerous,
followed closely by an altercation at the Joint Security Area at
Panmunjon where US, ROK, and DPRK soldiers interact constantly.
[**China-Taiwan** conflict]{.underline}, whereby China may use nuclear
weapons to overcome US forces operating in the West Pacific, either at
sea, or based on US (Guam, Alaska) or US allied territory in the ROK,
Japan, the Philippines, or Australia); or US uses nuclear weapons in
response to Chinese attack on Taiwan. [**China-Japan**
conflict]{.underline} escalates via attacks on early warning systems,
for example, underwater hydrophone systems (Ayson-Ball, 2011).
[**China-Russia** conflict]{.underline}, possibly in context of
loss-of-control of Chinese nuclear forces in a regional conflict
involving Taiwan or North Korea. [**Russia-US** conflict]{.underline},
involving horizontal escalation from a head-on collision with Russian
nuclear forces in Europe or the Middle East; or somehow starts at sea
(mostly likely seems ASW) or over North Korea (some have cited risk of
US missile defenses against North Korean attack as risking Russian
immediate response). [Combinations of or simultaneous eruption of the
above conflicts that culminate in nuclear war are also
possible]{.underline}. Other unanticipated nuclear-prone conflict axes
(such as Russia-Japan) could also emerge with little warning.
[Precursors of such nuclear-laden conflicts]{.underline} in this region
[also exist that could lead states to the brink of nuclear
war]{.underline} and demonstrate that nuclear war is all too possible
between states in this region. Examples include the August 1958
Quemoy-Matsu crisis, in which the United States deployed nuclear weapons
to Taiwan, and the US Air Force has only a nuclear defense strategy in
place to defend Taiwan should China have escalated its shelling campaign
to an actual attack; the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, when a US
nuclear armed missile was nearly fired from Okinawa due to a false fire
order; the March 1969 Chinese-Soviet military clash and resulting
consideration of nuclear attacks by both sides; and the August 1976
poplar tree crisis at Panmunjon in Korea, when the United States moved
nuclear weapons back to the DMZ and the White House issued pre-delegated
orders to the US commander in Korea to attack North Korea if the tree
cutting task force was attacked by North Korean forces. Loss-of-control
of Nuclear Weapons As is well known, nuclear armed states must
routinely---and in the midst of a crisis---ensure that their nuclear
weapons are never used without legitimate authority, but also ensure at
the same time that they are always available for immediate use with
legitimate authority. This "always-never" paradox is managed in part by
a set of negative and positive controls, reliant upon procedural and
technical measures, to maintain legitimate state-based
command-and-control (see Figure Four). \[FIGURE 4 OMITTED\] In this
framework, Jerry Conley has produced a taxonomy of nuclear
command-and-control structures that embody varying notional national
"command-and-control" orientations (also referred to as stability points
or biases). Each nuclear armed state exhibits a distinct preference for
technical and procedural measures to achieve negative and positive
control of nuclear weapons. The way that a state constructs its control
system varies depending on its size, wealth, technology, leadership, and
strategic orientation, lending each state a unique use propensity
affected by the information processing and transmission functions of the
nuclear command-and-control system, that in part determines the use or
non-use decisions made by the leaders of nuclear armed states. The
resulting ideal nuclear command-and-control state structures are shown
in Table 1. \[TABLE 1 OMITTED\] These ideal types are summarized with
respect to the defining axes of control measure in Figure Five. \[FIGURE
5 OMITTED\] In Northeast Asia, a four-way nuclear threat system exists
that has a three world-class nuclear armed states, the United States,
Russia and China, interacting with a fourth tier, barely nuclear armed
state, the DPRK. In this quadrilateral nuclear standoff, the DPRK's
simple NC3 system likely is an amalgam of a poorly resourced,
militarized, and personalized leadership---which may lead it to
oscillate between procedural and technical measures as the basis of
control, with a primary emphasis on positive use control, not negative
control to avoid unauthorized use. China's large, centralized NC3 system
co-mingles nuclear and conventional communications between national
commanders and deployed nuclear forces and may emphasize negative more
than positive use controls to ensure Party control. Russia's highly
centralized, complex NC3 system relies on legacy technology and limited
economic base for modernization. It too may be more oriented towards
negative controls in peacetime, but have the capacity to spring almost
instantly to primary reliance on positive controls in times of crisis or
tension. The US NC3 system is large, complex and based on wealth and
technological prowess. It is under civilian, not military control, at
least in principle and in peacetime, and is redundant, diverse, and
relatively resilient. Non-state nuclear attack as trigger of inter-state
nuclear war in Northeast Asia The critical issue is how [a nuclear
terrorist attack may "catalyze" inter-state nuclear war, especially the
NC3 systems that inform and partly determine how leaders respond to
nuclear threat]{.underline}. Current conditions in Northeast Asia
suggest that [multiple precursory conditions for nuclear terrorism
already exist or exist in nascent form]{.underline}. In Japan, for
example, low-level, individual, terroristic violence with nuclear
materials, against nuclear facilities, is real. [In **all
countries**]{.underline} of the region, [the **risk of diversion of
nuclear material is real**, although the risk is likely higher due to
volume and laxity of security in some countries]{.underline} of the
region [than in others]{.underline}. [In all countries, the risk of an
**insider "sleeper" threat is real** in security and nuclear agencies,
and such insiders **already operated in actual terrorist
organizations**]{.underline}. [Insider corruption is also observable in
nuclear fuel cycle agencies in all countries]{.underline} of the region.
The threat of extortion to induce insider cooperation is also real in
all countries. [The possibility of a **cult attempting to build and buy
nuclear weapons is real** and has already occurred]{.underline} in the
region.\[15\] [**Cyber-terrorism against nuclear reactors is real and
such attacks have already taken place** in South Korea]{.underline}
(although it remains difficult to attribute the source of the attacks
with certainty). [The stand-off ballistic and drone threat to nuclear
weapons and fuel cycle facilities is real in the region, including from
non-state actors, some of whom have already adopted and used such
technology almost instantly from when it becomes accessible]{.underline}
(for example, drones).\[16\] Two other broad risk factors are also
present in the region. The [social and political conditions for
**extreme ethnic and xenophobic nationalism are emerging**]{.underline}
in China, Korea, Japan, and Russia. Although there has been no risk of
attack on or loss of control over nuclear weapons since their removal
from Japan in 1972 and from South Korea in 1991, this risk continues to
exist in North Korea, China, and Russia, and to the extent that they are
deployed on aircraft and ships of these and other nuclear weapons states
(including submarines) deployed in the region's high seas, also outside
their territorial borders. [The most conducive circumstance for
catalysis to occur due to a nuclear terrorist attack might involve the
following nexi of timing and conditions]{.underline}: [Low-level,
tactical, or random individual terrorist attacks for whatever reasons,
even assassination of national leaders, up to and including dirty
radiological bomb attacks, that overlap with inter-state crisis dynamics
in ways that affect state decisions to threaten with or to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. This might be undertaken by an opportunist nuclear
terrorist entity in search of rapid and high political impact. Attacks
on major national or international events in each country to maximize
terror and to de-legitimate national leaders and whole governments. In
Japan, for example, more than ten heads of state and senior ministerial
international meetings are held each year. For the strategic nuclear
terrorist, patiently acquiring higher level nuclear threat capabilities
for such attacks and then staging them to maximum effect could accrue
strategic gains. Attacks or threatened attacks, including deception and
disguised attacks, will have maximum leverage when nuclear-armed states
are near or on the brink of war or during a national crisis (such as
Fukushima), when intelligence agencies, national leaders, facility
operators, surveillance and policing agencies, and first responders are
already maximally committed and over-extended. At this point, we note an
important caveat to the original concept of catalytic nuclear war as it
might pertain to nuclear terrorist threats or attacks. Although an
attack might be disguised so that it is attributed to a nuclear-armed
state, or a ruse might be undertaken to threaten such attacks by
deception, in reality a catalytic strike by a nuclear weapons state in
conditions of mutual vulnerability to nuclear retaliation for such a
strike from other nuclear armed states would be highly irrational.
[Accordingly, the effect of nuclear terrorism involving a nuclear
detonation or major radiological release may not of itself be catalytic
of nuclear war---at least not intentionally]{.underline}--because it
will not lead directly to the destruction of a targeted nuclear-armed
state. [Rather, it may be catalytic of non-nuclear war between
states]{.underline}, especially if the non-state actor turns out to be
aligned with or sponsored by a state (in many Japanese minds, the
natural candidate for the perpetrator of such an attack is the pro-North
Korean General Association of Korean Residents, often called Chosen
Soren, which represents many of the otherwise stateless Koreans who were
born and live in Japan) and a further sequence of coincident events is
necessary to drive escalation to the point of nuclear first use by a
state. Also, the catalyst---the non-state actor--is almost assured of
discovery and destruction either during the attack itself (if it takes
the form of a nuclear suicide attack then self-immolation is assured) or
as a result of a search-and-destroy campaign from the targeted state
(unless the targeted government is annihilated by the initial terrorist
nuclear attack). It follows [that the effects of a non-state nuclear
attack may be characterized better as a [trigger]{.mark} effect,
bringing about [a **cascade** of]{.mark} nuclear use decisions within
NC3 systems that shift each state increasingly away from nuclear non-use
and increasingly towards nuclear use by releasing negative controls and
enhancing positive controls in **multiple [action-reaction escalation
spirals]{.mark}**]{.underline} (depending on how many nuclear armed
states are party to an inter-state conflict that is already underway at
the time of the non-state nuclear attack); [and/or by inducing
concatenating nuclear attacks across geographically proximate nuclear
weapons forces of states already caught in the crossfire of nuclear
threat or attacks of their own making before a nuclear terrorist
attack]{.underline}.\[17\] [An example of a cascading effect would be a
non-state attack on a key node of linked early warning systems that is
unique to and critical for strategic nuclear forces to be employable, or
the effect of multiple, coincident and erroneous sensor alerts of
incoming attacks]{.underline} (as occurred during the Cuban Missile
Crisis with radar in Florida monitoring Soviet missiles in Cuba that
mistakenly fused an erroneous reading of a missile trajectory with a
real observation of a Soviet satellite that happened to be passing
overhead). [An example of a concatenating effect would an attack that
leads a nuclear weapons state to target two other states forces because
it **cannot determine whose forces attacked** its own]{.underline}. This
circumstance might arise if key anti-submarine forces or an aircraft
carrier battle group were attacked and it was impossible to determine in
a given waterway or area of ocean whose submarines were present or
responsible for the attack, leading the attacked state to destroy all
the submarines presenting on-going threat to its strategic forces. As we
noted above, a terrorist nuclear shock may take various forms and appear
in different places. Ever since an extortion attempt in Boston in 1974
based on the threat of nuclear detonation, the threat of an improvised
nuclear device has been credible. For such a threat to be credible, a
non-state terrorist entity must release a plausible precursor such as
nuclear material or warhead design information, or stage an actual
demonstration attack that makes it plausible that the attacker controls
a significant quantity of fissile material (most likely plutonium, or
simply radioactive materials suitable for a radiological device that
might be used to draw in first responders and then detonate a warhead to
maximize damage and terror). Such an attack might be combined with a
separate attack on critical infrastructure such as a cyberattack. The
attacker might retain sufficient material for bargaining and insurance
should the initial attack fail. Given the need to adapt to
circumstances, such an attacker is likely to be patient and strategic,
in the terms defined earlier, and to have extensive organizational and
communication capacities; and to be able to operate at multiple targeted
sites, possibly in multiple countries. Given its patience and stamina,
such an attacker would select a highly symbolic target such as a high
level meeting. Such a case would present the targeted state with an
exquisite dilemma: bargaining and negotiation with the non-state actor
threatening such an attack may be justified given the explicit and
plausible nature of the threat, which may be politically impossible
while making counter-terrorism operations very risky and only possible
with extreme caution. And, such an attacker might well issue a false
statement about state-sponsorship to invoke third parties in ways that
vastly complicate the response to the threat. If the attacker is less
capable and driven for immediate political or other returns, then it may
be satisfied with highly delegated delivery with no recall option, and
no use of communications to minimize the risk of discovery or
interdiction. Such an attacker is also less likely to wait for the
circumstances in which inter-state nuclear war is more likely due to
inter-state tension; and also less likely to seek third party effects
beyond the damage to the immediate target and resulting terror. Should
surveillance indicate that an improvised nuclear device is in motion,
then an all-out search to interdict the attackers and to retrieve the
device or materials would likely ensue. In these two instances of
credible threat of non-state nuclear attack, the insider versus outsider
perpetrator factor will affect significantly how the attack affects
possible inter-state conflicts. In Kobe's terms, if the perpetrator is
confirmed to be an outsider, then a country-of-origin suspicion matrix
may cast suspicion onto another state as possible sponsor. For an attack
threatened in China, the linkage might be back to Russia, the United
States, or North Korea. For an attack threatened in Russia, the linkage
might be back to the United States, China, or North Korea. For an attack
threatened in North Korea, the linkage might be back to the United
States, China, or Russia. And for an attack threatened in one of the
umbrella states in the region, South Korea and Japan, such an attack
might be linked to each other, as well as to China, North Korea, or
Russia. In each case, the shadow of suspicion and possible accusations
could tilt decision-making processes in one or more of these states and
ways that could worsen pre-existing views about the nuclear use
propensity of an opposing nuclear armed state. Should an actual nuclear
attack occur, the situation is even more complex and problematic. Such
an attack might be purely accidental, due to hardware, software, or
human error while nuclear materials or weapons are in transit. In
principle, this limits the site of such an event to the nuclear weapons
states or their ships and aircraft as neither South Korea nor Japan host
nuclear weapons today. If an insider is involved, then the perpetrator
may be identified quickly, and whether there is a linkage with another
state may become evident (depending on nuclear forensics as well as
insight obtained from surviving attackers). If an outsider is the
perpetrator, then the suspicion matrix will come into play again, with
possibly severe effects on inter-state tension due to accusation,
suspicion, and fear of follow-on attacks. During the attack, especially
if it is a hostage-taking type of attack, the identity of the
perpetrator may be unknown or ambiguous, and maintaining this ambiguity
or even opacity as to the attacker may be deliberate---as was the case
with the 2008 Mumbai attack in which the controller tried to ensure that
all the attackers were killed in the course of the twelve separate but
coordinated attacks across the city over four days. [Although much
progress has been made in]{.underline} establishing local **[nuclear
forensics]{.underline}** capability in Japan,\[18\] China, and South
Korea, [there is **no certainty** that it is sufficiently developed to
identify the perpetrator of an act of nuclear terrorism, especially if
there is a state sponsor and deception involved]{.underline}. Conclusion
We now move to our conclusion. Nuclear-armed states can place themselves
on the edge of nuclear war by a combination of threatening force
deployments and threat rhetoric. Statements by US and North Korea's
leaders and supporting amplification by state and private media to
present just such a lethal combination. Many observers have observed
that the risk of war and nuclear war, in Korea and globally, have
increased in the last few years---although no-one can say with authority
by how much and exactly for what reasons. However, states are restrained
in their actual decisions to escalate to conflict and/or nuclear war by
conventional deterrence, vital national interests, and other
institutional and political restraints, both domestic and international.
It is not easy, in the real world, or even in fiction, to start nuclear
wars.\[19\] Rhetorical threats are standard fare in realist and
constructivist accounts of inter-state nuclear deterrence, compellence,
and reassurance, and are not cause for alarm per se. States will manage
the risk in each of the threat relationships with other nuclear armed
states to stay back from the brink, let alone go over it, as they have
in the past. This argument was powerful and to many, persuasive during
the Cold War although it does not deny the hair-raising risks taken by
nuclear armed states during this period. Today, the multi-polarity of
nine nuclear weapons states interacting in a four-tiered nuclear threat
system means that the practice of sustaining nuclear threat and
preparing for nuclear war is no longer merely complicated, but is now
enormously complex in ways that may exceed the capacity of some and
perhaps all states to manage, even without the emergence of a fifth tier
of non-state actors to add further unpredictability to how this system
works in practice. The possibility that non-state actors may attack
without advance warning as to the time, place, and angle of attack
presents another layer of uncertainty to this complexity as to how
inter-state nuclear war may break out. That is, non-state actors with
nuclear weapons or threat goals and capacities do not seek the same
goals, will not use the same control systems, and will use radically
different organizational procedures and systems to deliver on their
threats compared with nuclear armed states. If used tactically for
immediate terrorist effect, a non-state nuclear terrorist could
violently attack nuclear facilities, exploiting any number of
vulnerabilities in fuel cycle facility security, or use actual nuclear
materials and even warheads against military or civilian targets. If a
persistent, strategically oriented nuclear terrorist succeed in gaining
credible nuclear threat capacities, it might take hostage one or more
states or cities. [If such an event coincides with already high levels
of tension and even military collisions between the non-nuclear forces
of nuclear armed states, then a non-state nuclear terrorist attack could
impel a nuclear armed state to escalate its threat or even military
actions against other states, in the belief that this targeted state may
have sponsored the non-state attack, or was simply the source of the
attack, whatever the declared identity of the attacking non-state
entity. This outcome could trigger these states to go onto one or more
of the pathways to inadvertent nuclear war, especially if the terrorist
attack was on a high value and high risk nuclear facility or involved
the seizure and/or use of fissile material. **[Some]{.mark} experts
[dismiss]{.mark} this possibility** as so remote as to be not worth
worrying about. **[Yet]{.mark} the [history]{.mark} of nuclear terrorism
globally**]{.underline} and in the Northeast Asian region
**[[suggests]{.mark} otherwise]{.underline}**. Using the sand castle
metaphor, once built on the high tide line, sand castles may withstand
the wind but eventually succumb to the tide once it reaches the
castle---at least once, usually twice a day. Also, [**theories of
organizational and technological failure** point to the **coincidence of
[multiple]{.mark}, relatively [insignificant]{.mark} driving
[events]{.mark}** that interact or **[accumulate]{.mark}** in ways that
lead the "metasystem" to fail, **[even if each]{.mark} individual
[component]{.mark} of a system [works perfectly]{.mark}**. Thus, the
potential **catalytic effect** of a nuclear terrorist incident is **not
that it would of itself lead to a sudden inter-state nuclear war**; but
that [at a time of **crisis**]{.mark} when **alert levels** are
**already high**, when control systems on nuclear forces have already
shifted from primary emphasis on negative to positive control, when
[**decision making** is **already stressed**]{.mark}, when the
[potential for **miscalc**]{.mark}ulation [is]{.mark} already
**[high]{.mark}** due to shows of force indicating that first-use is
nigh, when **rhetorical threats** promising annihilation on the one
hand, or collapse of **morale** and weakness on the other invite
counter-vailing threats by nuclear adversaries or their allies to gain
the upper hand in the "contest of resolve," and when **organizational
cybernetics** may be in play such that purposeful actions are
implemented differently than intended, then a terrorist nuclear attack
may shift a coincident combination of some or all of these factors to a
threshold level where they [**collectively** lead to a **first-use
decision**]{.mark} by one or more nuclear-armed states]{.underline}. [If
the terrorist attack is timed or happens to **coincide with high levels
of inter-state tension** involving nuclear-armed states, then some or
**all of these tendencies will likely be in play** anyway---**precisely
the concern** of those who posit pathways [to **inadvertent nuclear
war**]{.mark}]{.underline} as outlined in section 2 above. The critical
question is, just as a catalyst breaks some bonds and lets other bonds
form, reducing the energy cost and time taken to achieve a chemical
reaction, how would a nuclear terrorist attack at time of nuclear
charged inter-state tension potentially shift the way that nuclear
threat is projected and perceived in a four or five-way nuclear-prone
conflict, and how might it affect the potential pathways to inadvertent
nuclear war in such a system? Such a pervasive incremental effect is
shown in Figure 6 below. \[FIGURE 6 OMITTED\] [Any one or indeed all of
these]{.underline} starting nuclear control profiles [may be
disputed]{.underline}, as might the control profile at the end of the
response arrow. (In Figure 6, each nuclear state responds to a terrorist
nuclear attack by loosening or abandoning negative controls against
unauthorized use, and shifts towards reliance mostly on positive
procedural controls biased towards use). [But]{.underline} each nuclear
armed state will make its moves in response to the posited terrorist
nuclear attack partly in response to its expectations as to how other
nuclear armed states will perceive and respond to these moves, as well
as their perception that an enemy state may have sponsored a terrorist
nuclear attack---and [considered together]{.underline}, it is obvious
that they may not share a common image of the other states' motivations
and actions in this response[, leading to cumulative potential for
misinterpretation and rapid subsequent action, reaction, and
escalation]{.underline}. It is also conceivable---although intuitively
it would seem [**far less likely**--that a terrorist nuclear attack at
such a conjuncture of partly or fully mobilized nuclear armed states
might induce one or more of them **to stand down**]{.underline}, slow
down its decision making or deployments, establish new communication
channels with potential nuclear enemy states, and even make common cause
to hunt down and eliminate the non-state nuclear terrorist entity, or
coordinate operations to respond to the threat of a second terrorist
nuclear attack---the credibility of which would be high in the aftermath
of a successful initial non-state nuclear attack. As Robert Ayson
concluded: In considering the ways in which a terrorist nuclear attack
could (wittingly or unwittingly) spark off a wider nuclear exchange
government leaders are entitled to be just as worried about their own
actions---how they would respond to a terrorist nuclear attack and how
that response might get very catastrophically out of control---as about
the terrorist act per se. If so, states need to do more than consider
the best ways to prevent terrorists from acquiring, deploying and then
detonating a nuclear weapon. They also need to think about how they can
control themselves in the event of a nuclear terrorist attack (even if
some might suggest this risks handing the terrorist a premature and
unnecessary victory by giving them indirect influence over the choices
states make).\[20\]

#### [Counterterror cooperation]{.underline} is [why]{.underline} cause-of-death stats don't reflect the [inevitability]{.underline} of [nuclear terrorism]{.underline} -- motive, means, opportunity, and organizational capacity are [all growing]{.underline}

**Allison 18** Dr. Graham Allison, Professor of Government at Harvard
Kennedy School, "Nuclear Terrorism: Did We Beat the Odds or Change
Them?" PRISM, 7(3), 5-15-2018,
<https://cco.ndu.edu/News/Article/1507316/nuclear-terrorism-did-we-beat-the-odds-or-change-them/>
/GoGreen!

Not surprisingly, the book attracted critics as well. The most common
objection focused on what [skeptics argued]{.underline} was [an
irresolvable contradiction between the core claims of "inevitable" and
"preventable." If something is preventable, then it cannot be
inevitable, they said]{.underline}.

My attempt to answer their point was proving largely ineffective, since
for the most part, I just kept repeating the argument stated in the
book. But fortunately, I was rescued by none other than Buffett himself.
In making judgments about buying stocks, and even more in owning and
running several reinsurance companies, Buffett had become a legendary
oddsmaker. Those businesses had also forced him [to think seriously
about [**nuclear terrorism** as]{.mark} one of what investors call
**["fat tail" risk]{.mark}s**]{.underline}. He had [concluded that such
an event [was **virtually inevitable**]{.mark} and]{.underline} that
[the consequences would be devastating]{.underline}. Thus he prohibited
his companies from writing insurance against nuclear terrorism.

The following two charts clarify Buffett's argument. Chart 1
demonstrates that [**if** the **probability** of a successful nuclear
terrorist attack in the year ahead is **10 percent**, and if that
condition persists **for 50 years**, the likelihood of nuclear terrorism
occurring is almost **100 percent**]{.underline} (99.5 percent to be
precise).3

**\[CHART 1 OMITTED\]**

Chart 1: Probability of Nuclear Terrorist Attack if Annual Odds are 10
percent.

But as Chart 2 illustrates, [**if actions were taken to reduce that
likelihood** from 10 percent a year to **1 percent**, the probability
that in the **next 50 years** there is **no** successful **nuclear
terrorist incident** rises from almost **zero to 60**.5
**percent**.]{.underline} These extrapolations are, as Buffett explains,
simple probability calculations.4

**\[CHART 2 OMITTED\]**

Chart 2: Probability of Nuclear Terrorist Attack if Annual Odds are 1
percent.

Prior to publication, a number of referees pointed out that even if one
agreed that the risks of nuclear terrorism were much greater than had
been previously recognized, the policy community would ask: how likely
is such an event, now? As one wag put it, what moves most Washingtonians
are consequences that could happen on their watch. Even those who found
Buffett's response analytically correct argued that it was too
"academic" for many participants in the policy debate.

Thus at their urging, in the final published text of Nuclear Terrorism I
offered my best judgment. Specifically, I wrote that on the trajectory
we were following in 2004, absent significant additional preventive
actions, the likelihood that terrorists would successfully explode a
nuclear bomb somewhere in the world in the decade ahead was "more likely
than not." As a leading advocate of what I call "betable
propositions"---putting one's money where one's mouth is---I made a
number of bets with colleagues who were more skeptical.5
Operationalizing my estimate, I bet \$51 of my money against \$49 of
theirs that before December 31, 2014 we would see an act of nuclear
terrorism. Needless to say, I was happy to lose these bets.

With the benefit of hindsight, it is fair to ask whether my 2004
assessment of the risk was wrong. To begin to try to answer that
question, it is necessary to start with candor about the larger question
of which it is a component. The cosmic question is why there has been no
mega-terrorist attack on the United States since September 11, 2001 when
al-Qaeda operatives crashed commercial airliners into the World Trade
Center and Pentagon.

In the wake of that attack, anyone who had offered to bet that 16 years
on there would have been no terrorist attack on the United States that
killed more than 100 people would have been able to get 1000:1 odds. In
each of the years since that attack, the annual threat assessment from
the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) has ranked terrorism as among the
top three threats to the United States. Polls find that more than 80
percent of Americans expect another major terrorist attack in the near
future.6 Half of Americans expect that they or a member of their family
will be killed by terrorists.7

How can we square these expectations with what has actually happened?
Who or what has actually killed Americans here in the United States
during the decade and a half since the al-Qaeda strike on 9/11?
[[On]{.mark} the record, tree limbs and other falling objects have
killed 100 times more Americans than terrorist attacks]{.underline}. As
Chart 3 demonstrates, apart from old age and disease, the leading causes
of death for Americans here at home have been opioid overdoses (40,000);
car accidents (39,000); and suicide (38,000).8

**\[CHART 3 OMITTED\]**

Chart 3: **[[Average Annual Deaths]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the United
States by Method of Death.

Thus, to put it bluntly, [[it is **hard to deny the gap**
between]{.mark} the [**expectations** of the **intelligence** and
**policy**]{.mark} **analytic [community]{.mark}**]{.underline} who have
been trying to understand terrorism and counterterrorism, [on the one
hand, [and]{.mark} the brute **[facts]{.mark}**, on the
other]{.underline}.

In attempting to understand the challenge of terrorism,
[analysts]{.underline} have [used]{.underline} versions of Sherlock
Holmes's framework of "MMO"---[**[motive]{.mark}**, means, and
opportunity]{.underline}. Identify actors who have the motivation,
means, and opportunity to commit an act of terrorism, and one has the
suspect list. My modified version of Holmes includes an additional "O"
for organizational capability. Individuals or groups motivated to take
an action but lacking the organizational skills to use available means
to exploit opportunities remain only potential risks.

[Employing this MMOO framework]{.underline} to the challenge of
terrorism since 9/11, [what do we find?]{.underline} [Potential
perpetrators motivated to conduct terrorist attacks on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [[have **multiplied**]{.mark}
beyond anyone's expectation]{.underline} in 2001. By invading and
occupying Iraq and Afghanistan, and striking targets in many other
countries with drones, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has **[created new enemies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In Iraq and
Afghanistan, our counterinsurgency campaigns on behalf of one faction
against others have given thousands of other people motives to seek
revenge against us]{.underline}. In what the Bush Administration labeled
the "Global War On Terrorism," U.S. forces have conducted attacks on the
territory of at least seven Muslim-majority nations---killing
individuals we labeled "terrorists," but also civilians who are known as
collateral damage. [These actions have provided fodder that extremists
have used skillfully to recruit and motivate payback]{.underline}.
Indeed, the Osama bin Laden dream to ignite a "clash of civilizations"
between Muslims and what he called the "Jewish-Christian crusaders" has
more credibility today than anyone could have imagined at the beginning
of the century.

[While post--9/11 security measures have made it more difficult to
hijack a commercial airliner, the **[means]{.mark}** by which to kill
double, triple, and even quadruple digit numbers of people [have also
**expanded**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Orlando and Las Vegas
shootings suggested, in many states in the United States, it is not that
hard to buy an assault rifle and ammunition that will allow a shooter to
fire 1,000 rounds in two minutes. And recent truck attacks by
ISIL-inspired fighters in Nice, Barcelona, and New York demonstrate that
terrorists recognize that modern life offers them many means by which to
carry out their attacks.9 The internet has also expanded the
availability of chemicals, deadly opioids like fentanyl, and even
pathogens. Web-accessible information about how to make elementary bombs
or acquire and use pathogens like anthrax has also increased.

[**[Opportunities]{.mark}** to kill hundreds or even thousands of
Americans also [abound]{.mark}]{.underline}. As military planners would
put it, the United States offers [a "target-rich"
environment]{.underline}. Terrorists intent on killing large numbers
could find them everywhere: from malls and movie theaters to sports
stadiums and churches.

[**[Organizational capability]{.mark}** appears to [have been
terrorists' **Achilles' heel**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The planner of
9/11, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, demonstrated extraordinary imagination and
operational skills. Intelligence professionals gave his design and
execution of the plan an "A." Fortunately, he has been one of the few.
Advances in al-Qaeda's bombmaking appear to be traceable also to a
single individual---Ibrahim al-Asiri. He developed the bombs for the
failed underwear bomb plot in 2009 and cargo hold plot in 2010, as well
as the laptop bomb that led the Trump Administration to temporarily ban
laptops on flights.10

[Terrorists have for the most part been "technically challenged." Should
[that]{.mark} factor change, the overall picture [could]{.mark} also
**[change dramatically overnight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In sum, the question about why there has been no nuclear terrorist
attack is one piece of the larger puzzle about why there has been no
mega-terrorist attack of any kind. And the deeper question behind that
is whether we in the analytic community have a good grasp on the
fundamentals of this challenge. Truth be told, I register my doubts.

Nonetheless, I am not ready to conclude that my 2004 estimate of the
odds of a nuclear terror attack was incorrect. And **[[contrary
to]{.mark} the claims of]{.underline}** a number of
**[[critics]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as a matter of statistics, the
evidence of the past 13 years does not require me to do so. A brief
aside on the logic of betting and odds will explain why. Imagine a coin
that was slightly weighted so that it had a 51 percent chance of landing
heads and 49 percent chance of tails. From a single toss of that coin
that landed tails, what could one conclude? Statistically, the answer
is---very little. Such a result would be expected to happen 49 out of
every 100 times the coin was tossed. If we tossed the coin a second
time, and again it landed tails, statisticians would again remind us
that the chances of that occurring were 1 in 4. [To conclude as a matter
of statistics that my estimate was incorrect would take a lifetime of
successive decades in which there was no successful nuclear
attack]{.underline}.11 Thus, I stand behind my assessment in 2004 that
the odds of an attack in the next decade were greater than even. (As
[we]{.underline} all [know]{.underline}, [**[dozens of]{.mark} planned
terrorist [attacks]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} failed or [been
**foiled**]{.mark}]{.underline}---from the Christmas Day underwear
bomber to the Times Square bombers.)

[The issue]{.underline} this article addresses [is whether in the past
decade we have just **beaten the odds**, **or** whether actions we have
taken have **changed the odds for the better**]{.underline}. To address
that question, it is necessary to review the array of factors and
actions that have reduced the risk of nuclear terrorism on the one hand,
and those that have increased the risk on the other.

Consider, for example, what would likely have happened after 9/11 had
Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda been able to continue operating from their
headquarters in Afghanistan. As the video bin Laden made after the
attack demonstrated, he was thrilled by what Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's
operation had achieved. He later called on all faithful Muslims to join
the jihad and top 9/11. At the pinnacle of his pyramid of destruction
was a mushroom cloud enveloping one of the great cities of the world.
What prevented that first and foremost was a relentless counterterrorism
campaign that killed or captured most of al-Qaeda's leadership and left
the others spending most of their time trying to survive rather than
perfecting plots for future terrorist attacks. Destruction of their
headquarters and training camps meant that thousands of individuals who
would have been planning, training, and then conducting terrorist
attacks never got their chance. On the other hand, the failure to stop
North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, as well as the collapse
of U.S.--Russian nuclear security cooperation, have created new
significant risks.

Section II of this article reviews actions taken that have reduced the
risk of nuclear terrorism. Section III reviews factors and actions that
have increased these risks. A concluding section offers an updated
assessment of the risks posed by nuclear terrorism from the perspective
of year-end 2017. [While applauding thousands of actions that have been
taken by hundreds of thousands of individuals in the past 13 years to
reduce these risks, reviewing all the pluses and all the
minuses]{.underline}, my gut tells me that the chances of a successful
nuclear terrorist attack in the decade that began in 2015---in effect,
the second flip of the coin---are better than even. Specifically, I
believe [the [**odds** of a **successful nuclear terrorist
attack**]{.mark} somewhere in the world [**before the end of 2024** are
**51 percent or higher**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While giving thanks
[[that **terrorists have failed**]{.mark} to achieve their deadliest
ambitions]{.underline}, in my view that [[is **not grounds for
complacency**, but]{.mark} rather a reason [for **redoubling**]{.mark}
**our [efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

I am aware that on an issue about which I am passionate, I may have
slipped from analysis to advocacy. The central point is not whether the
odds of a nuclear terrorist attack are 51 percent or 15 percent. Threat
equals likelihood times consequences, and in this case, the consequences
would be devastating. Since the costs of actions to reduce these risks
are modest, prudent policymakers should focus on the feasible agenda of
actions.

Factors and Actions That Have Reduced the Risk of Nuclear Terrorism

[In the past decade, [the **U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.mark} its [**international
partners** have taken]{.mark} literally **thousands of specific
[actions]{.mark}** [that **closed**]{.mark} **what had been [open
doors]{.mark}** [to **terrorists** acquiring a **nuclear bomb**,
or]{.mark} **nuclear [materials]{.mark}** from which they could have
fashioned an improvised nuclear weapon]{.underline}. In terms of the
MMOO framework, [U.S. **[counterterrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
counterproliferation [actions have [**significantly diminished**
both]{.mark} the [**means** and]{.mark} the
**[opportunities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

On the counterterrorism front, the terrorist groups that sought to
attack the United States with nuclear weapons have been decimated. Osama
bin Laden, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and most of the operational talent
behind 9/11 have been captured or killed. While Osama bin Laden's
deputy, Zawahiri, succeeded him as head of al-Qaeda, and while several
of the key operatives including Abdel Aziz al Masri, who led the
organization's nuclear program, remain missing, the deadly pursuit of
the entire roster of the organization by collaborative intelligence,
Special Operations Forces, and drones has severely diminished al-Qaeda's
ability to mount a nuclear terrorist attack.

Al-Qaeda's successor as the greatest terror threat to the United States,
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), has also suffered heavy
losses in recent months. In 2014, ISIL acquired a broad swath of
territory across Iraq and Syria---a safehaven in which it could train
militants, plot attacks, and compile resources. While we know less about
ISIL's efforts to acquire nuclear materials, the fact that the Belgian
police discovered that ISIL agents involved in the 2015 terrorist
attacks had surveillance footage of a Belgian nuclear research facility
is suggestive.12 Furthermore, its ideological centerpiece---an epic
final battle with the West---would seem to require nuclear Armageddon.
By wiping out its safehavens in Syria and Iraq, the United States and
its partners have diminished ISIL's ability to organize a major effort
to acquire nuclear weapons.

In an ideal world, NATO could keep discussions about burden sharing out
of the public eye altogether, granting that any organization with thirty
democratic members will inevitably have disparities. This would require
the US public and political community to recognize what is self-evident
to much of the policy community---that the benefits the United States
accrues from NATO are worth the costs.

Legal, Policy, Security

AFRL [[faces **many legal, policy, and security challenges** when
establishing **tech**]{.mark}nology [**collaborations** with
**international partners**]{.mark}. [**Navigating this bureaucracy** is
**time consuming** and]{.mark} can be **[highly resource
intensive]{.mark}**]{.underline} depending on the modality of the
partnership and the nature of the partner. As such, [[the]{.mark} speed
and [**level of effort** required]{.mark} to establish a partnership can
serve as [an **impediment** or **disincentive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Another challenge stems from legal constraints on specific technologies.
While these technologies are still new, challenges may emerge as the
U.S. determines if any of the information, hardware, or specific
technologies should be subject to export controls; this may render
certain types of collaboration untenable. Another challenge will be the
impact of national data protection laws: as countries define their
approach to Information Security, international partners may have data
security requirements that may hamper or raise the cost of meaningful
collaboration.

Budget

Like any organization allocating finite resources, AFRL must prioritize
investment decisions. [Developing technologies of strategic importance
is]{.underline} not only **[resource intensive]{.underline}**, but
effectiveness of investment is difficult to quantify. Identifying
metrics to measure effectiveness and return on investment will be a
challenge and will require testing and adjustment and may vary depending
on the maturity of the partnership.

Human Capital

[In order to realize meaningful outcomes from international
engagements]{.underline}, AFRL [will [need]{.mark} to ensure they have
[enough **human capital capacity**]{.mark} to balance staffing both
national projects and emerging international projects]{.underline}.
While the AFRL has established mechanisms to attract and retain
high-quality science and engineering talent, the AFRL is [still [subject
to the macro-]{.mark}trend of the national **[shortage of STEM
personnel]{.mark}** which may make hiring additional suitable personnel
a challenge]{.underline}.

II\. Cyberspace's Future

Envision a future in which reliable access to the Internet is available
from nearly any point on the globe, at a price that businesses and
families can afford. Computers can communicate with one another across a
seamless landscape of global networks permitting trusted, instantaneous
communication with friends and colleagues down the block or around the
world. Content is offered in local languages and flows freely beyond
national borders, as improvements in digital translation open to
millions a wealth of knowledge, new ideas, and rich debates. New
technologies improving agriculture or promoting public health are shared
with those in greatest need, and difficult problems benefit from global
collaboration among experts and innovators. This, in part, is the future
of cyberspace that the United States seeks---and the future we will work
to realize.

In this future, individuals and businesses can quickly and easily obtain
the tools necessary to set up their own presence online; domain names
and addresses are available, secure, and properly maintained, without
onerous licenses or unreasonable disclosures of personal information.
The best engineers work together internationally to develop new
standards for information systems that make networks faster and more
reliable, catalyzing innovation and expanding accessibility. High-tech
industry works with its customers to provide software, hardware, and
services that are more secure, more reliable, and more responsive to
their needs.

It is a future in which universities and companies are free to research
and develop new concepts and products because they know their
intellectual property and valuable data are safe, even on shared
networks. Individuals know the threats to their personal computers, and
can take easy-to-use measures to protect their systems. Private-sector
companies also take a responsibility for their network hygiene, knowing
that in so doing, they protect their investments. When cybersecurity
incidents demand government action, officials can detect those threats
early and share data in real-time to mitigate the spread of malware or
minimize the impact of a major disruption---all while preserving the
broader free flow of information. When a crime is committed
internationally, law enforcement agencies are able to collaborate to
safeguard and share evidence and bring individuals to justice.

This future promises not just greater prosperity and more reliable
networks, but enhanced international security and a more sustainable
peace. In it, states act as responsible parties in cyberspace---whether
configuring networks in ways that will spare others disruption, or
inhibiting criminals from using the Internet to operate from safe
havens. States know that networked infrastructure must be protected, and
they take measures to secure it from disruption and sabotage. They
continue to collaborate bilaterally, multilaterally, and internationally
to bring more of the world into the information age and into the
consensus of states that seek to preserve the Internet and its core
characteristics.

The United States and a growing number of partners have laid the
foundation for this future already. But it is not a foregone conclusion,
and we cannot build it alone. [Though [progress]{.mark} may be [**slow**
and **resource-intensive**]{.mark}, the international community must
join together in support of this **long-term investment**]{.underline}.
We must do so with the clear understanding that this vision of
cyberspace serves national interests as much as shared international
aims. The measure of our success will be another half-century of
information technology as transformational as the last, as we begin to
realize fully the benefits---and minimize the risks---of global
interconnection.

The Future We Seek

The cyberspace environment that we seek rewards innovation and empowers
individuals; it connects individuals and strengthens communities; it
builds better governments and expands accountability; it safeguards
fundamental freedoms and enhances personal privacy; it builds
understanding, clarifies norms of behavior, and enhances national and
international security. To sustain this environment, international
collaboration is more than a best practice; it is a first principle.

Our Goal

The United States will work internationally to promote an open,
interoperable, secure, and reliable information and communications
infrastructure that supports international trade and commerce,
strengthens international security, and fosters free expression and
innovation. To achieve that goal, we will build and sustain an
environment in which norms of responsible behavior guide states'
actions, sustain partnerships, and support the rule of law in
cyberspace.

Open and Interoperable: A Cyberspace That Empowers

At the core of digital innovation is the ability to add new
functionality to networked machines. The openness of digital systems
explains their explosive growth, rapid development, and enduring
importance. Networked technology's basic tools are steadily increasing
in availability and decreasing in price, as computer and Internet access
have spread to every nation. To continue to serve the needs of an
ever-growing wired population, manufacturers of hardware and operating
systems must continue to empower the widest possible range of developers
across the globe. As companies continue to drive innovation in the
development of proprietary software, we also applaud the vibrancy of the
open-source software movement, giving developers and consumers the
choice of community-driven solutions to meet their needs.

The United States supports an Internet with end-to-end interoperability,
which allows people worldwide to connect to knowledge, ideas, and one
another through technology that meets their needs. The free flow of
information depends on interoperability---a principle affirmed by 174
nations in the Tunis Commitment of the World Summit on the Information
Society. The alternative to global openness and interoperability is a
fragmented Internet, where large swaths of the world's population would
be denied access to sophisticated applications and rich content because
of a few nations' political interests. The collaborative development of
consensus-based international standards for information and
communication technology is a key part of preserving openness and
interoperability, growing our digital economies, and moving our
societies forward.

Secure and Reliable: A Cyberspace That Endures

For cyberspace as we know it to endure, our networked systems must
retain our trust. Users need to have confidence that their data will be
secure in transit and storage, as well as reliable in delivery. An
effective strategy will require action on many fronts, with shared
responsibility at every level of society, from the end-user up through
collaboration among nation-states.

[**Vulnerability reduction** will require robust **technical standards**
and solutions, effective **incident management**, trustworthy hardware
and software, and secure supply chains]{.underline}. [Risk reduction on
a global scale will require effective law enforcement; internationally
agreed **norms** of state behavior; measures that build confidence and
enhance transparency; active, informed diplomacy; and appropriate
deterrence]{.underline}. Finally, [incident response will require
**increased collaboration** and **technical information sharing** with
the private sector and international community]{.underline}. This work
cannot be fully addressed by any single nation or sector alone; it is a
responsibility and duty that every nation, and its people, all share.

Network stability is a cornerstone of our global prosperity, and
securing those networks is more than strictly a technical matter.
Economically, we must advance sustainable growth and invest in
infrastructure at home and abroad, while incentivizing network
reliability and clarifying the obligations of firms and states.
Politically, we must help to maintain an environment of respect for
technical infrastructure, so disputes do not become excuses to disrupt
and degrade networks. Socially, we must make end-users aware of their
responsibilities to maintain and operate their devices in a safe and
secure manner.

Stability Through Norms

The United States will work with like-minded states to establish an
environment of expectations, or norms of behavior, that ground foreign
and defense policies and guide international partnerships. The last two
decades have seen the swift and unprecedented growth of the Internet as
a social medium; the growing reliance of societies on networked
information systems to control critical infrastructures and
communications systems essential to modern life; and increasing evidence
that governments are seeking to exercise traditional national power
through cyberspace. These events have not been matched by clearly
agreed-upon norms for acceptable state behavior in cyberspace. To bridge
that gap, we will work to build a consensus on what constitutes
acceptable behavior, and a partnership among those who view the
functioning of these systems as essential to the national and collective
interest.

The Role of Norms. In other spheres of international relations, shared
understandings about acceptable behavior have enhanced stability and
provided a basis for international action when corrective measures are
required. Adherence to such norms brings predictability to state
conduct, helping prevent the misunderstandings that could lead to
conflict.

The development of norms for state conduct in cyberspace does not
require a reinvention of customary international law, nor does it render
existing international norms obsolete. Long-standing international norms
guiding state behavior---in times of peace and conflict---also apply in
cyberspace. Nonetheless, unique attributes of networked technology
require additional work to clarify how these norms apply and what
additional understandings might be necessary to supplement them. We will
continue to work internationally to forge consensus regarding how norms
of behavior apply to cyberspace, with the understanding that an
important first step in such efforts is applying the broad expectations
of peaceful and just interstate conduct to cyberspace.

The Basis for Norms. Rules that promote order and peace, advance basic
human dignity, and promote freedom in economic competition are essential
to any international environment. These principles provide a basic
roadmap for how states can meet their traditional international
obligations in cyberspace and, in many cases, reflect duties of states
that apply regardless of context. The existing principles that should
support cyberspace norms include:

• Upholding Fundamental Freedoms: States must respect fundamental
freedoms of expression and association, online as well as off.

• Respect for Property: States should in their undertakings and through
domestic laws respect intellectual property rights, including patents,
trade secrets, trademarks, and copyrights.

• Valuing Privacy: Individuals should be protected from arbitrary or
unlawful state interference with their privacy when they use the
Internet.

• Protection from Crime: States must identify and prosecute
cybercriminals, to ensure laws and practices deny criminals safe havens,
and cooperate with international criminal investigations in a timely
manner.

• Right of Self-Defense: Consistent with the United Nations Charter,
states have an inherent right to self-defense that may be triggered by
certain aggressive acts in cyberspace.

Deriving from these traditional principles of interstate conduct are
responsibilities more specific to cyberspace, focused in particular on
preserving global network functionality and improving cybersecurity.
Many of these responsibilities are rooted in the technical realities of
the Internet. Because the Internet's core functionality relies on
systems of trust (such as the Border Gateway Protocol), states need to
recognize the international implications of their technical decisions,
and act with respect for one another's networks and the broader
Internet. Likewise, in designing the next generation of these systems,
we must advance the common interest by supporting the soundest technical
standards and governance structures, rather than those that will simply
enhance national prestige or political control.

Emerging norms, also essential to this space, include:

• Global Interoperability: States should act within their authorities to
help ensure the end-toend interoperability of an Internet accessible to
all.

• Network Stability: States should respect the free flow of information
in national network configurations, ensuring they do not arbitrarily
interfere with internationally interconnected infrastructure.

• Reliable Access: States should not arbitrarily deprive or disrupt
individuals' access to the Internet or other networked technologies.

• Multi-stakeholder Governance: Internet governance efforts must not be
limited to governments, but should include all appropriate stakeholders.

• Cybersecurity Due Diligence: States should recognize and act on their
responsibility to protect information infrastructures and secure
national systems from damage or misuse.

While cyberspace is a dynamic environment, international behavior in it
must be grounded in the principles of responsible domestic governance,
peaceful interstate conduct, and reliable network management. As these
ideas develop, the United States will foster and participate fully in
discussions, advancing a principled approach to Internet policy-making
and developing shared understandings in fora appropriate to each issue.

Our Role in Cyberspace's Future

To realize this future and help promulgate positive norms, the United
States will combine diplomacy, defense, and development to enhance
prosperity, security, and openness so all can benefit from networked
technology. These three approaches are central to our efforts
internationally. In the latter half of the 20th century, the United
States helped forge a new post-war architecture of international
economic and security cooperation. In the 21st century, we will work to
realize this vision of a peaceful and reliable cyberspace in that same
spirit of cooperation and collective responsibility.

Diplomacy: Strengthening Partnerships

Extending the principles of peace and security to cyberspace---while
preserving its benefits and character---will require strengthened
partnerships and expanded initiatives. We will engage the international
community in frank and urgent dialogue, to build consensus around
principles of responsible behavior in cyberspace and the actions
necessary, both domestically and as an international community, to build
a system of cyberspace stability.

Diplomatic Objective

The United States will work to create incentives for, and build
consensus around, an international environment in which
states---recognizing the intrinsic value of an open, interoperable,
secure, and reliable cyberspace---work together and act as responsible
stakeholders.

Strengthening Partnerships

Through our international relationships and affiliations, we will seek
to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible are included in this
vision of cyberspace precisely because of its economic, social,
political, and security benefits. These efforts will be supported by
meaningful collaboration with the private sector at home and abroad.

Distributed systems require distributed action, and no single
institution, document, arrangement, or instrument could suffice in
addressing the needs of our networked world. From end-users,
private-sector hardware and software vendors, and Internet service
providers, to regional, multilateral, and multistakeholder
organizations---all are important in helping cyberspace meet its full
potential.

In the international arena in particular, states have an enduring role
to play in preserving peace and stability, empowering innovation,
safeguarding economic and national security interests, and protecting
and promoting the individual rights of citizens. In our international
relations, the United States will work to establish an environment of
international expectations that anchor foreign and defense policies and
strengthen our international relationships.

Bilateral and Multilateral Partnerships. We will work bilaterally with
nations to build collaboration on cyberspace issues important to our
governments and our peoples. Building broad international understanding
about cyberspace norms of behavior must begin with clear agreement among
like-minded countries. We will seek a broad community of partners in
these efforts, and will include cyberspace issues in a wide range of
bilateral dialogues, at all levels of government and across a wide range
of our activities. We will advance common action on cyberspace's
emerging challenges, while building on those enforcement tools and
approaches already enjoying success. Furthermore, we will actively
engage the developing world, and ensure that emerging voices on these
issues are heard.

International and Multi-stakeholder Organizations. Regional
organizations have been particularly effective at tackling cybersecurity
problems specific to their members. They will play an increasingly
important role in developing and applying norms of behavior. We will
continue to use our membership in these organizations, as well as in
broader international organizations, to develop productive agendas that
are appropriate to each organization's expertise and that realize
concrete benefits for members. In Internet governance policy, important
steps have been made to ensure responsiveness and international
representation in key organizations. The United States salutes those
efforts, and will continue to recognize the unique contribution of such
fora that represent the entire Internet community by integrating the
private sector, civil society, academia, as well as governments in a
multi-stakeholder environment.

Private Sector Collaboration. Although the private sector already plays
an important role in international and multi-stakeholder organizations,
we will continue to leverage existing partnership mechanisms to engage
with industry partners. In particular, we will work closely with
infrastructure owners and operators---who are responsible for the
majority of network functionality---to expand initiatives to secure the
network ecosystem, preserve the benefits and character of cyberspace,
avoid unnecessary impediments to technological evolution, and extend
principles of peace and security. We also seek the private sector's
participation in Internet governance as essential to upholding its
multi-stakeholder character, and will continue to advocate for
inclusiveness in fora that take up such issues.

Defense: Dissuading and Deterring

The United States will defend its networks, whether the threat comes
from terrorists, cybercriminals, or states and their proxies. Just as
importantly, we will seek to encourage good actors and dissuade and
deter those who threaten peace and stability through actions in
cyberspace. We will do so with overlapping policies that combine
national and international network resilience with vigilance and a range
of credible response options. In all our defense endeavors, we will
protect civil liberties and privacy in accordance with our laws and
principles.

Defense Objective

The United States will, along with other nations, encourage responsible
behavior and oppose those who would seek to disrupt networks and
systems, dissuading and deterring malicious actors, and reserving the
right to defend these vital national assets as necessary and
appropriate.

Dissuasion

Protecting networks of such great value requires robust defensive
capabilities. The United States will continue to strengthen our network
defenses and our ability to withstand and recover from disruptions and
other attacks. For those more sophisticated attacks that do create
damage, we will act on well-developed response plans to isolate and
mitigate disruption to our machines, limiting effects on our networks,
and potential cascade effects beyond them.

Strength at Home. Ensuring the resilience of our networks and
information systems requires collective and concerted national action
that spans the whole of government, in collaboration with the private
sector and individual citizens. For a decade, the United States has been
fostering a culture of cybersecurity and an effective apparatus for risk
mitigation and incident response. We continue to emphasize that
systematically adopting sound information technology practices---across
the public and private sectors---will reduce our Nation's
vulnerabilities and strengthen networks and systems. We are also making
steady progress towards shared situational awareness of network
vulnerabilities and risks among public and private sector networks. We
have built new initiatives through our national computer security
incident response team to share information among government, key
industries, our critical infrastructure sectors, and other stakeholders.
And we continually seek new ways to strengthen our partnership with the
private sector to enhance the security of the systems on which we both
rely.

Strength Abroad. This model of defense has been successfully shared
internationally through education, training and ongoing operational and
policy relationships. Today, through existing and developing
collaborations in the technical and military defense arenas, nations
share an unprecedented ability to recognize and respond to incidents---a
crucial step in denying would-be attackers the ability to do lasting
damage to our national and international networks. However, a globally
distributed network requires globally distributed early warning
capabilities. We must continue to produce new computer security incident
response capabilities globally, and to facilitate their interconnection
and enhanced computer network defense. The United States has a shared
interest in assisting less developed nations to build capacity for
defense, and in collaboration with our partners, will intensify our
focus on this area. Building relationships with friends and allies will
increase collective security across the international community.

Deterrence

The United States will ensure that the risks associated with attacking
or exploiting our networks vastly outweigh the potential benefits. We
fully recognize that cyberspace activities can have effects extending
beyond networks; such events may require responses in self-defense.
Likewise, interconnected networks link nations more closely, so an
attack on one nation's networks may have impact far beyond its borders.

In the case of criminals and other non-state actors who would threaten
our national and economic security, domestic deterrence requires all
states have processes that permit them to investigate, apprehend, and
prosecute those who intrude or disrupt networks at home or abroad.
Internationally, law enforcement organizations must work in concert with
one another whenever possible to freeze perishable data vital to ongoing
investigations, to work with legislatures and justice ministries to
harmonize their approaches, and to promote due process and the rule of
law---all key tenets of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime.

When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in
cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. All states
possess an inherent right to self-defense, and we recognize that certain
hostile acts conducted through cyberspace could compel actions under the
commitments we have with our military treaty partners. We reserve the
right to use all necessary means---diplomatic, informational, military,
and economic---as appropriate and consistent with applicable
international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our
partners, and our interests. In so doing, we will exhaust all options
before military force whenever we can; will carefully weigh the costs
and risks of action against the costs of inaction; and will act in a way
that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, seeking broad
international support whenever possible.

Development: Building Prosperity and Security

The United States will continue to demonstrate our conviction that the
benefits of a connected world are universal. The virtues of an open,
interoperable, secure, and reliable cyberspace should be more available
than they are today, and as the world's leading information economy, the
United States is committed to ensuring others benefit from our technical
resources and expertise.

Our Nation can and will play an active role in providing the knowledge
and capacity to build and secure new and existing digital systems, and
in so doing, build consensus among states to behave as responsible
stakeholders. Building capacity to realize these goals is not a
short-term expenditure, but a wise long-term investment and a commitment
on the part of our government for continued engagement.

Development Objective

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will facilitate
**cybersecurity capacity-building abroad**]{.underline}, bilaterally and
[through **multilateral organizations**]{.underline}, so that each
country has the means to protect its digital infrastructure, strengthen
global networks, and build closer partnerships in the consensus for
open, interoperable, secure, and reliable networks.

Building Technical Capacity

Access to networked technology is increasingly a basic need for
development. Governments and industry have made a number of meaningful
steps to enhance connectivity to end-users across un-served or
underserved regions. International information infrastructures continue
to mature and expand, providing more nations with the opportunity to
access the global flow of information. The growth of the networks
worldwide, and expansion of access to them, enriches the world
community, yet also presents new challenges and opportunities for
collaboration on issues of traditional and cybersecurity. Much of this
capacity will result from private-sector investment, and the United
States will work with governments and industry to build a climate
friendly to those efforts, and in which they can be leveraged to address
countries' core development needs.

Governments are a major determinant of whether this new connectivity
produces positive outcomes or wastes its potential. Those states that
have benefitted most from our capacity-building efforts are those that
embrace technology to build prosperity and enhance social cohesion,
rather than restrict access for the purposes of political control. For
that reason, technical projects that the United States supports will by
design enhance security and commerce, safeguard the free flow of
information, and promote the global interoperability of networks.

Building Cybersecurity Capacity

Prosperity cannot be built on a foundation of fear and unreliability,
and the United States is committed to helping build cybersecurity
capacity alongside states' own technological development. Enhancing
national-level cybersecurity among developing nations is of immediate
and long-term benefit, as more states are equipped to confront threats
emanating from within their borders and in turn, build confidence in
globally interconnected networks and cooperate across borders to combat
criminal misuse of information technologies. It is also essential to
cultivating dynamic, international research communities able to take on
next-generation challenges to cybersecurity.

[Acknowledging that **cybersecurity** is a global issue]{.underline}
that must be addressed with national efforts on the part of all
countries, we [[will **expand** and **regularize**]{.mark} initiatives
focused on **[cybersecurity capacity
building]{.mark}**]{.underline}---with enhanced focus on
awareness-raising, legal and technical training, and support for policy
development. [Such programs **[must address more than purely
tech]{.mark}nology issues**]{.underline}; we will work with states to
recognize the breadth of the cybersecurity challenge, assist them in
developing their own strategies, [and build capacity **[across the whole
range of sectors]{.mark}**---from network security and the establishment
of Computer Emergency Readiness Teams (**CERTs**), to international
**law enforcement** and **defense collaboration**, to productive
relationships [with]{.mark} the domestic and international private
sector and civil society]{.underline}.

Building Policy Relationships

The United States' capacity-building assistance is envisioned as an
investment, a commitment, and an important opportunity for dialogue and
partnership. As countries develop a stake in cyberspace issues, we
intend our dialogues to mature from capacity-building to active
economic, technical, law enforcement, defense and diplomatic
collaboration on issues of mutual concern. We will also facilitate
relationships among countries developing cybersecurity capacity---using
both regional fora and technical bodies possessing specialized
expertise---and will continue to promote the sharing of best practices,
lessons learned, and international technical exchanges.

III\. Policy Priorities

The United States will continue to take action to help build and sustain
open, interoperable, secure, and reliable networks at home and abroad,
both for our citizens and others in the global community. Our approach
is guided by the fundamental principles, driven by the overarching goal,
and sustained by the policies outlined in this document---together they
form the basis of the United States' international cyberspace strategy.

To fully realize this future in which cyberspace lives up to its
potential for all, the United States Government organizes its activities
across seven interdependent areas of activity, each demanding
collaboration within our government, with international partners, and
with the private sector. Taken as a whole, they form the action lines of
our strategic framework.

For the many departments and agencies of the United States Government
already engaged in these activities, they provide reinforcement to the
important work already underway. For those developing implementation
plans to carry out their specific responsibilities in cyberspace, they
provide context and ensure unity of effort. The policy priorities
outlined here call for and guide those specific actions, highlighting
areas of past, present and future emphasis that demand concerted
attention and resources at the national level.

Economy: Promoting International Standards and Innovative, Open Markets

To ensure that cyberspace continues to serve the needs of our economies
and innovators, we will:

• Sustain a free-trade environmentthat encourages technological
innovation on accessible, globally linked networks. Just as the free
flow of information is critical to the functioning of our networks, free
trade helps support innovation and market growth in the information age.
The global embrace of the Internet can largely be traced to the spread
of lower-cost and globally available computers and network technology.
Competition in these markets drives innovation, while a free-trade
environment enables manufacturers to keep prices competitive and
standards high. Respecting the international standards of technology
development and trade is an essential part of sustaining open markets,
and enables leading-edge technology companies to rapidly deliver the
benefits of their innovative products and services. Over the next few
decades, the globalization of technology manufacturing will only
increase, with substantial benefits for our networks and consumers. The
United States will work to sustain that free-trade environment,
particularly in support of the high-tech sector, to ensure future
innovation.

• Protect intellectual property, including commercial trade secrets,
from theft. The same global networks that power innovation also open up
new avenues for industrial espionage and the theft of intellectual
property and commercial information. Cyberspace can be used to steal an
unprecedented volume of information from businesses, universities, and
government agencies; such stolen information and technology can equal
billions of dollars of lost value. Individual incidents often go
unreported or undetected. Results can range from unfair competition to
the bankrupting of entire firms, and the national impact may be orders
of magnitude larger. The persistent theft of intellectual property,
whether by criminals, foreign firms, or state actors working on their
behalf, can erode competitiveness in the global economy, and businesses'
opportunities to innovate. The United States will take measures to
identify and respond to such actions to help build an international
environment that recognizes such acts as unlawful and impermissible, and
hold such actors accountable.

• Ensure the primacy of interoperable and secure technical standards,
determined by technical experts. Developing international, voluntary,
consensus-based cybersecurity standards and deploying products,
processes, and services based upon such standards are the basis of an
interoperable, secure and resilient global infrastructure. The public
and private sectors must work together to develop, maintain, and
implement these standards and support the development of international
standards and conformity assessment schemes that prevent barriers to
international trade and commerce. International cybersecurity
standardization, and its voluntary and consensus-based processes, serves
collective interests. They foster innovation; facilitate
interoperability, security, and resiliency; improve trust in online
transactions; and spur competition in global markets. The United States
will foster collaboration between the public and private sector to
ensure the promulgation of international standards-based requirements
for products and services.

Protecting Our Networks: Enhancing Security, Reliability, and Resiliency

Because strong cybersecurity is critical to national and economic
security in the broadest sense, we will:

• Promote cyberspace cooperation, particularly on norms of behavior for
states and cybersecurity, bilaterally and in a range of multilateral
organizations and multinational partnerships. An increasing number of
international organizations are taking up cybersecurity and other
cyberspace issues, and the United States continues to promote this
important work, building cyberspace into their range of work to meet the
needs of their varied memberships. We have worked to include relevant
cyberspace issues on the agenda at the Organization of American States
(OAS), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum
(ARF), the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization (APEC), the
Organization for Cooperation and Security in Europe (OSCE), the African
Union (AU), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD), the Group of Eight (G-8), the European Union (EU), the United
Nations (U.N.), and the Council of Europe, and to ensure that work is
supported by an effective institutional framework. The United States
will continue, in these and other fora, to consolidate regional and
international consensus on key cyberspace activities, including norms.
We will also look to fora that enable multi-stakeholder collaboration
and consensus building, to further elaborate the Internet policy
principles outlined in this document. We welcome the expansion of this
work to geographic regions currently underrepresented in the
dialogue---most notably Africa and the Middle East---to further our
interest in building worldwide capacity

• Reduce intrusions into and disruptions of U.S. networks. Unauthorized
network intrusions threaten the integrity of economies and undermine
national security. Agencies across the United States Government are
collaborating, together with the private sector, to protect innovation
from industrial espionage, to protect Federal, state, and local
government networks, to protect military operations from degraded
operating environments, and to secure critical infrastructure against
intrusions and attacks---particularly those on energy, transportation,
or financial systems, and the defense industrial base. The United States
will pursue a broad international consensus of states that recognize the
importance of respect for property and network stability, and will back
up that conviction with our own and our partners' willingness to defend
our networks from acts that would compromise them.

• Ensure robust incident management, resiliency, and recovery
capabilities for information infrastructure. In an interconnected global
environment, weak security in one nation's systems compounds the risk to
others. No one nation can have full insight into the world's networks;
we have an obligation to share our insights about our own networks and
collaborate with others when events might threaten us all. As we
continue to build and enhance our own response capabilities, we will
work with other countries to expand the international networks that
support greater global situational awareness and incident
response---including between government and industry. The United States
Government actively participates in watch, warning, and incident
response through exchanging information with trusted networks of
international partners. We will expand these capabilities through
international collaboration to enhance overall resilience. The United
States will also work to engage international participation in
cybersecurity exercises, to elevate and strengthen established operating
procedures with our partners.

• Improve the security of the high-tech supply chain, in consultation
with industry. The operation of critical networks and information
infrastructures depends on the assured availability of trustworthy
hardware and software. Vulnerabilities in the supply chain can enable
attacks on the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of networks
and the data they contain. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities impairs
economic performance and national security. The United States will work
with industry and international partners to develop best practices for
protecting the integrity of information systems and critical
infrastructure. In this way, we will greatly enhance the security of the
globalized supply chains on which free and open trade depend.

Law Enforcement: Extending Collaboration and the Rule of Law

To enhance confidence in cyberspace and pursue those who would exploit
online systems, we will:

• Participate fully in international cybercrime policy development. The
United States is committed to participating actively in discussions
about how international norms and measures on cybercrime are developed
bilaterally and multilaterally, in fora with proven expertise and a
history of promoting effective cybercrime policies. These conversations
will incorporate existing efforts, like how to extend the reach of
institutions like the Budapest Convention. The United States will build
these efforts upon the successful partnerships between national law
enforcement agencies and the productive policy dialogues that we
currently enjoy, cultivating a sense of responsibility among states
joining this effort.

• Harmonize cybercrime laws internationally by expanding accession to
the Budapest Convention. The United States and our allies regularly
depend upon cooperation and assistance from other countries when
investigating and prosecuting cybercrime cases. This cooperation is most
effective and meaningful when the countries have common cybercrime laws,
which facilitates evidence-sharing, extradition, and other types of
coordination. The Budapest Convention on Cybercrime provides countries
with a model for drafting and updating their current laws, and it has
proven to be an effective mechanism for enhancing international
cooperation in cybercrime cases. The United States will continue to
encourage other countries to become parties to the Convention and will
help current non-parties use the Convention as a basis for their own
laws, easing bilateral cooperation in the short term, and preparing them
for the possibility of accession to the Convention in the long term.

• Focus cybercrime laws on combating illegal activities, not restricting
access to the Internet. Criminal behavior in cyberspace should be met
with effective law enforcement, not policies that restrict legitimate
access to or content on the Internet. To advance this goal, the United
States Government works on a bilateral and multilateral basis to ensure
that countries recognize that online crimes should be approached by
focusing on preventing crime and catching and punishing offenders,
rather than by broadly limiting access to the Internet, as a broad
limitation of access would affect innocent Internet users as well. As
the United States and our partners engage in dialogue and help build
capacity among law enforcement organizations worldwide, we will
integrate this approach, uniting protection of privacy, fundamental
freedoms, and innovation with collaboration to combat crimes in
cyberspace.

• Deny terrorists and other criminals the ability to exploit the
Internet for operational planning, financing, or attacks. The United
States has a variety of international capacity-building and training
programs on cybercrime, helping law enforcement and legislators develop
effective legal frameworks and expertise to investigate and prosecute
terrorist and other criminal misuse of the Internet. Preventing
terrorists from enhancing capabilities through "hackers for hire" and
organized crime tools is an important priority for the international
community, and demands effective cybercrime laws. The United States is
committed to tracking and disrupting terrorist and cybercrime finance
networks through technical tools and international cooperation
frameworks such as the Financial Action Task Force.

Military: Preparing for 21st Century Security Challenges

Since our commitment to defend our citizens, allies, and interests
extends to wherever they might be threatened, we will:

• Recognize and adapt to the military's increasing need for reliable and
secure networks. We recognize that our armed forces increasingly depend
on the networks that support them, and we will work to ensure that our
military remains fully equipped to operate even in an environment where
others might seek to disrupt its systems, or other infrastructure vital
to national defense. Like all nations, the United States has a
compelling interest in defending its vital national assets, as well as
our core principles and values, and we are committed to defending
against those who would attempt to impede our ability to do so.

• Build and enhance existing military alliances to confront potential
threats in cyberspace. Cybersecurity cannot be achieved by any one
nation alone, and greater levels of international cooperation are needed
to confront those actors who would seek to disrupt or exploit our
networks. [This effort begins by acknowledging that the interconnected
nature of networked systems of our closest allies, such as those of
**[NATO]{.mark}** and its member states, creates opportunities and new
risks]{.underline}. [Moving forward, the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will]{.underline} continue to [work with the
militaries and civilian counterparts of our **allies**]{.underline} and
partners [[to **expand** **situational awareness**]{.mark} and **shared
warning systems**]{.underline}, enhance our ability to work together in
times of peace and crisis, [and develop the means and method of
**collective self-defense** in cyberspace]{.underline}. Such military
alliances and partnerships will bolster our collective deterrence
capabilities and strengthen our ability to defend the United States
against state and non-state actors.

• [Expand cyberspace cooperation with allies]{.underline} and partners
to increase collective security. The challenges of cyberspace also
create opportunities to work in new ways with allied and partner
militaries. [By developing a shared understanding of **standard
operating procedures**, our armed forces can enhance security
[through]{.mark} coordination and **[greater info]{.mark}rmation
[exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}; these engagements will diminish
misperceptions about military activities and the potential for
escalatory behavior. [**Dialogues** [and]{.mark} **best practice
exchanges** to enhance partner capabilities, such as **[digital
forensics]{.mark}**, work force development, and network penetration and
**resiliency testing** will be important to this effort]{.underline}.
The United States will work in close partnership with like-minded states
to leverage capabilities, reduce collective risk, and foster
multi-stakeholder initiatives to deter malicious activities in
cyberspace.

### L -- Cybersecurity -- Hybrid War

#### Plan's an [enormous]{.underline} drain on resources

**Sanger 16** David E. Sanger, White House and national security
correspondent and senior writer at The New York Times, senior fellow in
The Press and National Security at the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard, graduate of Harvard College, "As
Russian Hackers Probe, NATO Has No Clear Cyberwar Strategy," New York
Times, 6-16-2016,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/world/europe/nato-russia-cyberwarfare.html>
/GoGreen!

Two years ago, NATO declared that it could rule a cyberattack on one of
its member states to be the equivalent of an armed attack, which would
lead to a commitment by all NATO members to respond.

But when it comes to deterring the kinds of low-level probes, espionage
and attacks that flow through European computer networks every week,
NATO commanders do not seem prepared to take aggressive countermeasures.

Jens Stoltenberg, the **[NATO]{.underline}** secretary general, [has
taken a low-key, purely defensive view of what the alliance should do in
cyberspace]{.underline}. In an interview with the German newsmagazine
Der Spiegel last week, [he talked of sharing information and expertise,
but nothing of the kind of sophisticated probing and early-warning
deterrence strategies that large and small powers have begun to
develop]{.underline}.

In short, it sounded like a strategy from a previous age, before
cyberattacks were regularly used as a weapon and as a tool of espionage.

James Lewis of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington, who has written about how NATO could use offensive
cyberweapons, said there was "a huge reluctance to share capabilities."
The United States and Britain say little about their offensive
cyberweapon abilities, even to their NATO allies.

"The Russians get that," Mr. Lewis said. "And they know that there is
lots they can do without triggering any response."

In part, that is because the Russians are experts at hiding their
tracks. Almost all of the studies of the Ukraine power grid attack in
late 2015 --- both unclassified and classified --- have pointed to
hackers in Russia. But American intelligence officials say they have
never been able to track the blackout, which affected 225,000
Ukrainians, directly to Mr. Putin's government, and probably never will.

Instead, American officials are giving cyberutility firms and
cybersecurity groups around the United States confidential presentations
of an analysis of what happened to the Ukrainian utilities, as a warning
of what could occur on home soil.

At United States Cyber Command, which has expanded rapidly since the
United States carried out cyberattacks against Iran in 2010, Russia's
networks are a regular target of surveillance. By next year, Cyber
Command will have more than 130 teams fully in operation around the
world, integrated into Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force units, in
addition to teams that work alongside the National Security Agency at
Fort Meade, Md.

It has built up a vast early warning network, placing tens of thousands
of "implants" --- sensors that can also be used to insert malware ---
into networks around the world. But [[**NATO** is **only beginning** to
explore]{.mark} what it delicately calls "**[active defense]{.mark}**,"
and says it is not focused on offensive cyberweapons]{.underline}.

The Russians have no such compunctions. But it is unclear what Russian
hackers hope to achieve here in the Baltics, other than to make the
point, as they did in 2007 when they brought Estonia to an electronic
halt, that they can get into any system, anytime.

"Whatever the Russians have in mind --- mostly intimidation --- it
usually fails," said Estonia's president, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, who grew
up in New Jersey before coming here to turn this small NATO country into
a pioneer in introducing new web-based technology for governing a
nation. The 2007 attacks backfired, he noted, because they drove
Estonians far more solidly into the European and NATO camps.

In Sweden and Finland, neutral nations in the Cold War, the politics are
more complex. As the NATO exercise began in Finland last week, the
Finnish foreign minister was in Moscow, meeting his Russian counterpart,
Sergey V. Lavrov.

The more Sweden and Finland turn to NATO, the more their networks, their
news sites and their government ministries come under cyberattack. As
Adm. John Richardson, the chief of United States naval operations, said
at an event at the Council on Foreign Relations in May, "The fact is
it's a pretty hot war in the cyber domain going on right now."

A hot war, but a kind that suits Russia well: It is [part of what
military strategists call "**[gray zone]{.mark}**" combat]{.underline}.
For Mr. Putin, [[**cyberespionage** and **cyberattacks**]{.mark} keep
NATO and its partners off balance]{.underline}. [They [are **enormously
difficult and expensive to defend against**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and,
at least for now, they have operated below the line that is likely to
prompt a military or economic response.

"It stays below the radar," Martin Libicki of the RAND Corporation told
a conference sponsored this month by the NATO cyber center here,
officially known as the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of
Excellence.

For the Russians, Mr. Libicki said, cyberespionage and weaponry are part
of a larger strategy of information warfare and a blitz of propaganda
that makes sorting out fact from fiction --- say, the causes of the
Malaysia Airlines crash in Ukraine --- all the more difficult. But the
attacks also remind the smaller nations here of their vulnerability,
even if Russia's troops stay on their side of the border.

[So far, NATO has found few effective means of deterring
attacks]{.underline}.

"The biggest problem in cyber remains deterrence," said Mr. Ilves, the
Estonian president, who has made the issue of avoiding cyber conflict
one of the main themes of his time in office. "We have been talking
about the need to deal with it within NATO for years now."

His fear, he said, is that Russia or other cyberattackers will soon move
to the next frontier: subtle manipulation of data like medical records,
the operations of weapons systems and navigation data.

But for now, Europe's focus is on keeping its secrets safe and its
weapons working. Germany issued a warning last month about Russian
attacks; its Parliament was targeted last year in an operation that
sought to install software that would have given Russia continuous
access to the Parliament's computer networks. Hans-Georg Maassen, the
head of the German domestic intelligence agency, told The Financial
Times that the Russians were "showing a readiness for sabotage."

Now, Germany's defense agency has done what NATO has not: It has started
its own cyberwarfare unit.

### L -- AI

/GoGreen!

Much has already been achieved in terms of new structures, **[[new
initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark}** and new policy developments [[to
support]{.mark} the collaborative adoption of [**AI** among
**NATO**]{.mark} Allies]{.underline} and EU member states. In addition
to pre-existing structures and mechanisms at both the NATO and EU
levels, which have ensured that nations are not starting from scratch,
national defence institutions are already able to refer to common policy
commitments and to options, [[whether]{.underline}]{.mark} through NATO
or the EDA, [[for **research** or **capability-development**
activities]{.underline}]{.mark}. At the same time, [ensuring a
competitive edge in AI is a truly whole-of-government effort which
[**requires considerable cross-over** between]{.mark} the [**military**
and **civilian** realms]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Large gaps remain between the US and the EU on certain key indicators.
At the same time, the gaps pertaining to research are far smaller. [To
ensure greater]{.underline} European [performance]{.underline} and
relevance [in AI in general, and its defence applications in
particular]{.underline}, it seems desirable to [focus on]{.underline}
two strategic priorities: **[[investment volumes]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
both public and private, [which [need to be **significantly
increased**]{.mark}; [and]{.mark} the [**full use** of **collaborative
mechanisms**]{.mark} involving the US]{.underline}.

To that end, it would be beneficial for nations on both sides of the
Atlantic to ensure that a clear and common vision is set out in
forthcoming strategic documents, most notably the EU's Strategic Compass
and NATO's new Strategic Concept. This should [include clear political
commitments to increasing investment, both in general and in instruments
for promoting collaborative innovation]{.underline}. There are
opportunities for 'more Europe' through the EDA and the European Defence
Fund. But while pursuing those avenues, European capitals should
prioritise efforts that complement and enhance transatlantic approaches,
in recognition of the reality that the US remains the indispensable ally
for Europe's security.

/GoGreen!

[The effectiveness of any technology alliance [will **depend on
prioritization**]{.mark}. Allies **[cannot work]{.mark} together
[on]{.mark}**]{.underline} every new technology or address **[[every
issue]{.underline}]{.mark}** that either enables or impedes cooperation.
They will [have to make choices]{.underline}, particularly on two
questions: Which technologies are most critical for---and amenable
to---allied cooperation? And where along the chain of technology
development are the greatest opportunities for---and obstacles
to---allied cooperation?

WHICH TECHNOLOGIES?

[[In]{.underline}]{.mark} his first major speech as President Biden's
national security adviser, Jake Sullivan highlighted four sectors that
will define what he called "the third wave of the digital revolution":
AI, **[[biotech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}**, semiconductors, and
telecommunications. This [is]{.underline} a [reasonable]{.underline}
list [around which to explore the possibility for allied
cooperation]{.underline}. These sectors increasingly shape how we make
decisions, how we physically live and breathe, how we power technology,
and how we communicate. The potential for growth and innovation in these
four areas over the next decade or two is enormous. They are [also
technologies on which international [competition is]{.mark} likely to be
[most intense]{.mark}]{.underline}---and on which the benefits of
cooperation are potentially greatest. China, in particular, has set its
sights on global preeminence in all four of these areas.

Each of these areas has great potential for expanded cooperation among
allies:

AI refers to the creation of smart machines that can mimic human
learning and thought-process capabilities. This technology allows
machines to operate human-run tasks, potentially improving the cost,
accuracy, and efficiency of these activities. China is dedicating
significant state resources toward AI tech development, with potentially
troubling commercial and military implications for the United States and
its allies. There is a solid foundation for allied cooperation on AI.
Research collaboration in this area is already well established,
including a formal partnership between the U.S. National Science
Foundation and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of
Canada on technology research, of which AI is an important component,
and the 2020 U.S.-UK declaration to further cooperation in AI R&D.
Expanding this kind of research collaboration, particularly on scaling
and commercializing AI technologies, could help get allied AI products
to market and ensure they are competitive with Chinese alternatives.
Moreover, there are several useful international policy frameworks on
which to build out allied cooperation. These include the G7-led Global
Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI), the Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) Principles on AI, and AI
provisions in regional trade arrangements, including the Singapore-led
Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).

Biotechnology, the creation of products through biological materials or
processes, has enormous potential for solving health, agriculture, and
environmental challenges. Moreover, one of the most important areas of
potential for biotech lies in its ability to transform the manufacturing
sector. Biomanufacturing---the application of biotech in
manufacturing---will allow countries to not only create different types
of products but to do so in new, more sustainable ways. For example,
Cambium BioMaterials, a Bay Area start-up, recently biomanufactured an
enhanced flame-retardant material using plant-based ingredients that is
now being used in commercial and military grade.
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, the world's leading manufacturer,
[[already dedicates **significant resources**]{.mark} to support
innovation in **biotech**, for potential commercial and military
purposes. **[Allied coop]{.mark}eration** [on **biotech** is
**nascent**]{.mark} at this point, but]{.underline} the United States,
Germany, Singapore, and Israel are notable leaders in the field, and
[[there is]{.mark} significant [scope for **building out
collaboration**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Semiconductors are "the brains of modern electronics." They control the
flow of electrical currents in electronic devices, making them a
critical component of the technologies of both today and tomorrow. And
as the world's digital transformation accelerates, so does the demand
for semiconductors. The world needs more large-scale semiconductor
production facilities to meet this demand, but because it is
increasingly expensive and complex to produce semiconductors, no one
country can solely support this expansion. The semiconductor industry is
already one that benefits from specialization---and cooperation---across
allies and partners, with the United States dominating front-end
research and design, and East Asian countries---including Taiwan, South
Korea, and Japan---leading the manufacturing segment of the supply
chain. Yet China has set its sights on assuming global leadership in
advanced semiconductor manufacturing, as detailed in Beijing's 2014
Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development.
In response to that and other foreign government subsidy programs for
semiconductor development, the U.S. Congress enacted the Creating
Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America (CHIPS) Act in
the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. If funded, this would
direct \$52 billion of federal money toward domestic semiconductor
manufacturing and R&D. The Biden administration has supported the CHIPS
Act as critical to sustaining U.S. competitiveness in semiconductors,
but it will also be important to enhance cooperation with allies and
partners on this foundation technology.

Telecommunications---the transmission of data via wire, radio waves,
optical fiber, and other means---are the backbone of today's
interconnected economy. The technology underlying telecom networks has
advanced rapidly in the past two to three decades through several
"generations." The global market for telecom equipment is dominated by a
handful of vertically integrated suppliers such as Huawei and ZTE of
China, Ericsson of Sweden, and Nokia of Finland. The sector is highly
susceptible to first-mover advantages; the first company to deploy the
latest generation network (5G) doesn't have to compete with other
companies for subscribers and network partners, amassing large shares of
both and making it easier for the company to deploy other technologies
(telecom equipment, phones, radios, etc.) to their subscribers and
network partners. China has moved aggressively in international forums
and markets to try to harness the first-mover advantage by setting
standards that favor its telecom networks and equipment. This poses a
critical challenge to the United States and allied countries,
particularly in their ability to secure competitive market shares for
their telecom and other network-dependent technology. Allied efforts are
already underway to try to diminish the impact of the first-mover
advantage by promoting the use of the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)
platform, which is not reliant on supplier-specific software or
hardware. The O-RAN Alliance, a group of over 270 telecommunications
operators and vendors that are dedicated to creating "fully
interoperable mobile networks," and the Open RAN Policy Coalition, a
group of 60 technology companies from around the world dedicated to the
advancement and adoption of open RANs, are critical groups of allied
companies working to foster a collaborative environment for
telecommunication technology. The United States and Japan have been
particularly active in their efforts to innovate in telecoms and compete
with China, notably through joint investments in 6G development under
the countries' newly launched Global Digital Connectivity Partnership.
Allied efforts in telecommunications can help expand these efforts and
increase O-RAN adoption.

WHERE TO FOCUS COOPERATION?

After agreeing on the technologies to prioritize, allies will need to
decide how to direct their efforts along the technology development
chain and what substantive issues to focus on. There are opportunities
to expand cooperation across a range of activities, from research
collaboration to joint financing. In roundtables and conversations with
experts conducted by the CSIS Economics Program as part of this project,
two cross-cutting issues repeatedly came up: data and standards.
Focusing allied efforts on aligning approaches in these two areas would
make a significant contribution to joint promotion of critical
technologies.

After agreeing on the technologies to prioritize, allies will need to
decide how to direct their efforts along the technology development
chain and what substantive issues to focus on.

Data

In 2020, the world generated some 44 zettabytes of data---"40 times more
bytes than there are stars in the observable universe." Data are
everywhere, fueling technology and informing our decisions and
innovation choices. In biotechnology, for example, data analytics help
biopharmaceutical researchers identify drug candidates for early-stage
testing and drug development. Progress in AI development is largely a
function of data and the computing power to process it.

These and similar innovations are dependent on data quantity, quality,
and diversity---how much data one has, how accurate and usable those
data are, and how many different types of data are available. As the
Global Data Alliance, an industry coalition, notes, greater data
quantity allows researchers and firms to "identify meaningful insights,
patterns, and connections that can aid R&D teams in discovering and
developing novel solutions to scientific and technical challenges."
Access to high-quality data enables faster, more reliable discoveries.
Data diversity helps researchers and firms broaden these discoveries,
applying them to new products, patients, and processes.

Data are essential to allied technology efforts for the seemingly simple
reason that sharing data is beneficial. Sharing increases the quantity
of data and therefore the potential for new discoveries. But it also
improves the quality of data, by allowing entities to verify their data
against data held by others and to inform, supplement, and complement
their data. Sharing data can also increase the diversity of data sets,
allowing researchers and producers to apply their results to a wider
range of products and demographics. This is especially important in the
development of AI, where access to different types of data allows
machines to make better decisions.

For all the benefits of data sharing, a number of frictions impede
allied cooperation in this area. These include national laws and
policies to protect the privacy and security of sensitive data. Every
government has a legitimate interest in ensuring that sensitive
personal, business, and government information does not get into the
wrong hands, and law and policy in this area nearly always restrict the
use and sharing of this data in some ways. The problem is when these
restrictions inhibit reasonable, responsible, and ethical data sharing
with organizations in like-minded countries involved in joint research
projects. There are emerging differences in national philosophies and
regulatory approaches to data privacy and security that complicate, or
may preclude, allied data sharing in support of joint promotion of
critical technologies.

As mentioned earlier, the European Union considers personal data privacy
a human right and has put into law what is arguably the global standard
for data protection in its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
Several other countries have enacted data laws based on GDPR, including
South Korea and India. For its part, the United States has a patchwork
of privacy rules at the state and sectoral level but no comprehensive
federal legislation in this area. By contrast, data security has taken
on new salience in Washington, as highlighted by President Biden's
signing of an executive order in this area in June. How this will affect
Washington's historic position that data should generally flow freely
across borders remains to be seen.

Meanwhile, several allied and partner countries have also enacted data
localization policies, which require data to be stored domestically.
This can silo data within states, impede data flows, and undermine
innovation. According to a report by the Information Technology and
Innovation Foundation (ITIF), as of 2020, 62 countries had enacted 144
data localization policies. Many governments such as the European Union
and South Korea claim that data localization is necessary to protect
"important" or "sensitive" data from being shared; U.S. financial
regulators take a similar view with respect to financial data. However,
localization policies are often broadly applied and seem to be less
about legitimate protection than about protectionism.

Efforts to bridge the differences among allies on data flows, privacy,
and security have so far had mixed success. Japan has usefully put
forward the concept of "data free flow with trust (DFFT)" and won both
G7 and G20 endorsement of the idea, but it has yet to be turned into an
agreed set of rules and practices. To facilitate data flows across the
Atlantic, the United States and the European Union negotiated a "privacy
shield" in 2016, providing a mechanism for companies to comply with GDPR
regulations when transferring data from Europe to the United States.
However, in 2020, the European Court of Justice found that the framework
failed to meet GDPR standards and subsequently invalidated the policy.
Without a replacement framework, transatlantic technology cooperation
will be constrained.

More positively, as detailed in a CSIS report in April 2021, there has
been useful work on developing agreed approaches to data governance in a
number of recent trade agreements, particularly among U.S. partners in
the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)
incorporates and builds on commitments to substantially free
cross-border data flows and other rules the United States won agreement
to in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) before it pulled out in early
2017. Similar provisions were included in the U.S.-Japan Digital Trade
Agreement concluded in 2019. And Singapore has been a leader in aligning
data governance policies through its bilateral trade agreements, in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and through its
innovative DEPA arrangement.

Moving forward, to capitalize on the innovation gains that come from
sharing data and promote meaningful allied technology cooperation, the
Biden administration should focus on several lines of effort to
reconcile the divergent approaches to data governance among its key
allies. First, it should work with Congress to enact comprehensive
federal privacy legislation. Second, it should use the new TTC forum
with the European Union to align transatlantic positions on data
privacy, security, and flows. Third, it should embrace the work on data
governance in the Asia-Pacific region, starting by docking onto DEPA.
And fourth, it should work to identify areas where U.S. agencies can
pool data with like-minded countries in the interest of conducting joint
research on issues of mutual concern. (For example, NIST could combine
data with UK or EU counterparts to improve the accuracy of facial
recognition tests.) These efforts will help improve the quantity,
quality, and diversity of allied data sets, enabling greater innovation
opportunities for allied researchers and firms in critical sectors such
as AI, biotech, semiconductors, and telecommunications.

Standards

The term "standards" is used to describe a broad array of rules,
metrics, and norms, ranging from ubiquitous technical specifications
like Bluetooth to safety requirements such as the warning labels found
on lawn mowers to expected approaches that establish a certain baseline
such as in accounting standards. In all these variations, standards
convey a sense of expectation of performance. There are broadly two
types of standards: consensus standards and technical regulations.
Consensus standards are the outcomes of processes where general
agreement rather than unanimity is sought and the development of such
outcomes is voluntary. Technical regulations refer to the use of
standards by the government to meet a specific policy objective and
where conformance with the standard is mandatory.

Standards are critical to innovation for two reasons: first, they
provide a foundation for technology development upon which product
differentiation can be made, which makes it easier to deploy competitive
products, including by leveraging first-mover advantages; and second,
they boost product interoperability and consumer confidence in
technologies, expanding existing technology markets and helping to
create new ones. The focus here is mainly on voluntary standards
because, as with data governance, there is arguably more work to be done
to align allied approaches.

Global standards are typically set in a broad range of bodies that are
open to participation by all interested stakeholders and where
decisionmaking is done by consensus. Examples of such as bodies include
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Third
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), and the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Participants in these bodies include a
mix of government and private-sector researchers and other experts from
the member countries. The process for reaching agreement on standards
varies by organization, with different thresholds in balloting that help
establish consensus.

As is the case with data governance, the United States and its allies
have different approaches to standard setting. While government agencies
such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
Department of Defense, and the Department of Transportation participate
in many standard-setting bodies, Washington does not lead in setting
technical standards. It is the long-standing policy of the United States
to allow the private sector to take the lead, leveraging the extensive
technical expertise and experience available in industry and its
knowledge of market need and demands. This private-sector--led
approach---in which the U.S. government participates as a contributor,
user, and enforcer---has helped establish and maintain U.S. industrial
and technological leadership since World War II. By contrast,
governments in Europe and Asia tend to have a top-down approach to
standard setting, establishing standardization priorities and attempting
to develop and protect domestic champions. In order to achieve these
objectives, these governments often send a large number of officials to
push for preferred national outcomes.

While there is a strong case [for the **U.S. government** to **step up**
its]{.underline} long-term [game in international standard
setting]{.underline}---for example, [[by **investing in** and
**adequately resourcing**]{.mark} government [experts to
participate]{.mark} in global standards work---the likelihood that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies will align
their approaches in standard-setting bodies is low]{.underline}. In
addition to the philosophical differences, these countries are also
competitors and want their own companies and technologies to "win" in
the marketplace. There are numerous examples of such competition in
emerging technologies such as cloud computing, cybersecurity, and
advanced manufacturing. Moreover, the industry-led U.S. approach, with
its competitive dynamics among actors who have a better sense of the
market potential of new technologies than governments, arguably has real
advantages over the top-down approach used by Europe and other allies.

A more productive line of effort for U.S. policymakers seeking to
promote greater allied alignment in the technical standards would be to
encourage pre-standardization cooperation. Here it is useful to explore
the concept of "technology readiness levels (TRLs)." These measure the
maturity of technology along a spectrum from early-stage basic research
to commercialization and deployment of technology. The lower the TRL,
the less developed the technology and the greater the need is for
fundamental research and development. Collaboration at low TRLs---basic
research---is already well established. International standard setting
happens at higher TRLs, where, as discussed above, allied cooperation
faces a number of challenges. The opportunity lies in the middle of the
TRL spectrum, where governments could help researchers collaborate on
basic research and develop shared insights and data and, by so doing,
set the stage for more productive standards cooperation and, even
further along the technology-development spectrum, promote regulatory
convergence among allies.

In addition to encouraging pre-standardization cooperation, Washington
could do more to engender trust and cooperation with the private sector
on standard setting and related policies. With its extensive firsthand
experience, the private sector can help the government better understand
the true dynamics of standard-setting rivalries in different standards
bodies. Greater public-private exchange of perspectives on the
commercial and national security dimensions of emerging technologies
would also be valuable. Also, as mentioned above, small amounts of
additional funding for government experts' participation in---though not
direction of---international standard-setting work could improve
public-private coordination and support U.S.-preferred outcomes.

While the focus here has mainly been on technical standards, it is also
important for the U.S. government to work closely with allies on
aligning regulatory approaches to technology. In addition to promoting
positive U.S.-preferred norms such as environmental and social
sustainability of technology, these efforts would help minimize the
scope for misuse or ethical breaches of new technologies. The OECD
Principles on AI, for example, are designed to ensure that development
of AI technologies adheres to global democratic and human rights values.
The International Bioethics Committee (IBC), housed under UNESCO, is
another body working to develop normative requirements to safeguard
human rights in the development and use of biotechnologies.

Getting Organized

Promotion of critical technologies is a complex and challenging
undertaking, even within a single country. The challenges are compounded
when coordinating efforts with other countries. An effective technology
alliance will require organizational structures and processes---both
within the United States and across allies and partners---that maximize
the benefits of cooperation and remove or overcome obstacles.

Effective organization starts at home. The Biden administration has
taken some useful first steps in this regard. They have rhetorically
made the case for promotion and protection of critical technologies and
for coordinating these efforts with allies. The White House has created
a new senior position in the National Security Council staff for
technology policy coordination and has elevated the head of the Office
of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to cabinet level to improve
internal U.S. government coordination. And it has made technology
cooperation a top agenda item for plurilateral forums of like-minded
countries such as the Quad and G7, as well as in bilateral engagement
with Europe, Japan, and other technology partners. Meanwhile, the U.S.
Congress has taken steps to provide legislative and financial support
for allied technology cooperation, including through measures such as
the U.S Innovation and Competitiveness Act (USICA) passed by the Senate
in June.

An effective technology alliance will require organizational structures
and processes---both within the United States and across allies and
partners---that maximize the benefits of cooperation and remove or
overcome obstacles.

However, there are still gaps and inconsistencies in Washington's
efforts at home to set the groundwork for a technology alliance.
[**[Announcing a new policy]{.mark}** direction [is one thing;
**carrying it out**]{.mark} in a sustained and consistent way [is **far
more challenging**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This requires a
well-functioning interagency process under the direction of the White
House that deploys relevant parts of the U.S. government. The Biden
administration has been slow to appoint senior officials at the under-
and assistant-secretary level at key economic agencies, who are critical
to effective policy formulation and implementation. Even when these
officials are in place, they need to be empowered to do the day-to-day
work of coordinating policy with allies, with direction---but not
micromanagement---from the White House.

[Moreover, Washington **[needs to make important substantive
investments]{.mark}** at home **[if it wants to win support from]{.mark}
allies** for its positions on the cross-cutting issues discussed
above]{.underline}. To promote its preferred approach to global data
governance, for example, the United States needs to enact comprehensive
federal privacy legislation. It needs to revitalize the U.S. approach to
standard setting, doing more to support the efforts of private companies
and experts in this area. And it needs to recommit to the U.S.
innovation base by, among other things, increasing federal R&D spending,
investing in skills, and building digital infrastructure. (Detailed
recommendations in these areas were included in the CSIS Trade
Commission's October 2020 report, Sharpening America's Innovative Edge.)

One more chore for the Biden administration is to reconcile the tension
between its appeal to allies for technology cooperation, on one hand,
and its stated preference to "buy American" and to onshore production of
critical technologies and supplies, on the other. Allies will be
reluctant to sign onto cooperation if they have doubts about what is in
it for them. This is an even more pointed question for allies still
subject to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

[Progress on these domestic organizational and messaging challenges will
need to be complemented by work to organize international cooperation on
technology promotion]{.underline}. Again, the Biden administration has
made a good start on agenda setting in the Quad and G7 and with
bilateral partners such as Japan, South Korea, and Germany. It has
wisely avoided calling for a single T12 forum with a predetermined group
of countries; the kind of "variable geometry" it has been promoting is
more suited to an issue area with a complex mix of critical technologies
and country capabilities.

[But there is **still work to be done to stitch all these strands
together**]{.underline}. It is especially important for Washington to
resolve its differences with Europe over the regulation of technology
and data, or at least to close the gap enough to align transatlantic
(essentially, G7) and transpacific (Quad) approaches to these issues. It
will also be important to pull in other economies as needed that are not
in the Quad or G7 but have advanced capabilities in key
technologies---such as the Netherlands, South Korea, and Taiwan on
semiconductors or Finland and Sweden on 5G---without making the web of
allied cooperative efforts too cumbersome.

With more alignment of key players within a technology alliance,
[Washington will then want to reinforce and build out work in
international institutions]{.underline} in which it retains
disproportionate influence [to develop U.S.-preferred rules, standards,
and norms]{.underline}. **[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the OECD
have done useful work to promote common principles on AI, for example;
the latter has also done important work on data governance. [**Allies**
will also **need to align positions** in standard-setting
bodies]{.underline} with a more diverse membership such as the
International Telecommunication Union.

Conclusion

[There are **many other important lines of effort needed** to promote
allied technology cooperation]{.underline} that strengthens U.S. and
allied competitiveness and national security. In a thoughtful article in
Foreign Affairs in October 2020, Jared Cohen and Richard Fontaine
outlined a number of other priority technologies for
cooperation---including quantum computing, drones, and financial
technology---as well as potential forms of collaboration---joint
assessments of risk, coordinating investments in R&D, and even aligning
education and immigration policies. And as mentioned earlier, the
protection side of the ledger also requires work to align allies' export
control, investment screening, and other technology control policies.
But the White House needs to start somewhere, and encouraging
collaboration among relevant groups of allies and partners on the four
technologies, two cross-cutting issues, and various organizational steps
identified in this brief would be a good place to focus initial efforts
and begin building an effective T12.

Exercises

Combined exercises are exercises between the U.S. forces and those of
one or more countries. It is common error to refer to these exercises as
multinational, coalition, or joint operations, but this is doctrinally
incorrect. It should be noted that the term "joint" refers to two or
more services, e.g., Army and Air Force. Exercises can be both joint and
combined, while most combined exercises are single-service combined
exercises. The primary purpose of [combined
**[exercises]{.mark}**]{.underline} is the training of U.S. forces,
[[emphasizing **interoperability** and **capability
building**]{.underline}]{.mark}, though the host nation also benefits
from the training as well. There are three types of exercises that may
fall under this title:

• Field Training Exercises (FTX): These are the most realistic of
exercises, taking the form of actual forces in the field, thus allowing
all the moving parts to be tested. [These [are]{.mark}]{.underline} also
[[the **most resource intensive** in **money**, **manpower**,
**material**, and **preparation time**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

• Command Post Exercises (CPX): An exercise in which the forces are
simulated, involving the commander, the staff, and
communications/coordination among the participating headquarters.

• Table Top Exercises (TTX): Tabletop exercises are the least
resource-intensive of these three types, ranging from a formal, detailed
planning process to a simple discussion. TTXs are excellent when senior
leaders want to explore a number for possible scenarios or possible
futures.

Figure S.6 presents a truncated version of this decision tree. In it, we
present a notional M&E strategy for Southern Accord, a multilateral
exercise held by U.S. Army Africa. We present this example in more
detail in Appendixes D and E. As an initial check, the decision tree
ties all M&E decisions to planners' TOCs (boxes 1 and 2). Three decision
nodes guided the notional path we outline for Southern Accord. First, is
this a recurring activity (box 5)? Southern Accord is a recurring series
of multilateral activities, but each one is relatively unique in its
execution. As a result, we expect that most planners will view Southern
Accord as a nonrecurring activity. In contrast, most training courses
would be recurring activities. Second, is this a resource-intensive
activity (box 6)? Historically, Southern Accord is a [[**command post**
and **tabletop exercise**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which [are generally
considered medium-cost training exercises---they [are **much more
resource intensive**]{.mark} than subject matter exchanges]{.underline},
but are dwarfed by an undertaking such as Pacific Engagement. Third, is
this activity a priority? Based on discussions with U.S. Army Africa
planners for previous RAND research, Southern Accord was identified as a
priority activity.5 Southern Accord, and its associated African Land
Forces Summit, provides a valuable forum for U.S. Africa and regional
leaders to engage. Based on these decision nodes, we recommend that an
activity such as Southern Accord incorporate a monitoring strategy in
the activity implementation.

If SC is incapable in many cases of building meaningful partner capacity
or creating real influence, then wonks will argue that SC and especially
military aid payments are needed to secure much more black-and-white
U.S. interests: overflight and transit agreements and peace treaty
compliance. Yet, this is another instance where the bankruptcy of SC
ideology is demonstrated. SC funding and services are generally not
initiated as a quid pro quo for overflight and transit. [**[Once the
flow of cash has started]{.mark}**, however, [threats of closing off
coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} in the form of overflight, transit, or
other agreements [**[become tools of extortion]{.mark}** in the hands of
the foreign partner. **[No matter how inefficient or
expensive]{.mark}**, the U.S. **[cannot turn]{.mark} the spigot down or
[off]{.mark}**]{.underline}. SC thus is not a tool to condition partner
behaviors, but rather an entitlement---a fee for maintaining the status
quo---a baseline bribe that creates a market of fees-for-service for the
most mundane issues.

SC does work to build capacity in certain, relatively elite units that
perceive a real need for improvement and hard training. Likewise, it
works to build interoperability between already-capable partner forces
and U.S. and coalition militaries. SC in the right doses can be a good
way of showing solidarity with allies against other regional threats.
But [**[SC]{.mark}** is not a panacea and [must be applied with]{.mark}
**significantly [more discernment]{.mark}** [than **the usual**]{.mark}
**some-is-good-[more-is-better logic]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} U.S.
**[military spending]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Planners should go to great lengths to ensure that SC is seen as a tool
for a specific purpose, not a reward to condition behaviors.
SC-as-a-conditioning-tool becomes bribery with diminishing returns. If
policymakers want a quid pro quo, they need to admit as much and use
much more precisely targeted incentives: paying a fee for access or
head-of-the-line transit privileges for example. This becomes a much
more predictable business transaction than trying to use SC funds,
winks, and nudges to get one's way.

Finally, in the land of perverse incentives, SC is often seen as a means
to drive defense business to U.S. contractors. This is true. By creating
arms races and supplying prestige weapons, however useless, to unstable
areas of the world, they are creating U.S. jobs. But wouldn't taxpayer
money and efforts be better spent if officials more precisely targeted
domestic concerns with taxpayer funds rather than hoping that efforts
trickle down predictably from collaboration with corpulent and unsavory
foreign generals?

[In the land [of **perverse incentives**]{.mark}, [**SC funding**
is]{.mark} one of [the **most egregious**]{.mark}]{.underline}---and in
the post-9/11 era, many officials see SC as a critical tool of strategic
positioning. However, [the **[premises]{.mark} of SC [must be

Similarly, [[authorities that **restrict activities to specific mission
areas**]{.mark} are **seen as inflexible** [in]{.mark} the face of
quickly **[emerging threats]{.mark}**, making it difficult to build
partner capacity in intended mission areas and further
**[impel]{.mark}ling [SC personnel to "game" the system to achieve
their]{.mark} SC [objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After 2001 and
until recently, the priority for U.S. national security strategy and for
SC (and DoD activity in particular) has been counterterrorism.24
Congress established Section 1206 and many other recent SC authorities
on the basis of the need to rapidly respond (and help partners respond)
to threats from al-Qaeda and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and
the Levant (ISIL). But as the CT mission area has been addressed in the
past ten to 15 years, other missions have emerged that are becoming
priorities for the United States and its partners but that are not
explicitly covered under the CT rubric (or under "stability operations,"
another area addressed in authorities). These other [emerging areas
include **cyber** warfare and **"hybrid" warfare** of the type
**Russia** has utilized to subjugate eastern **Ukraine** and annex
Crimea]{.underline} (gaps are also addressed in a subsequent section of
this chapter). [Capstone DoD strategic planning guidance that defines

A second general area of concern for DoD's SC workforce relates to the
unpredictability in Title 10 SC funding to enable planning of
initiatives and activities and the constraints on application of funds
in execution. Many DoD discussants indicated that the DoD strategic
planning guidance mandates a five-year planning horizon, yet Title 10
funding is available in much-shorter--term one- or two-year increments.
This injects an enormous amount of "guess-work"---according to one
discussant, "We are always gaming, guessing how much we think we are
going to get"34---into planning and limits predictability and
flexibility.35 According to another, "the Department lacks the ability
to engage in long-term activities with partner nations.... Programs are
episodic, and are generally not sustainable."36 This has had deleterious
effects in a number of ways.

First, [the Theater Campaign **[Plans]{.mark}** (TCPs) [that guide
**SC**]{.mark}]{.underline}, operations, posture, and other activities
within a CCMD **[[often are approved despite lack of insight into
whether]{.mark} the [programs to achieve]{.mark} TCP [objectives will be
available]{.mark}]{.underline}**.37 [Strategic guidance mandates that
DoD components develop five-year plans and identify how they intend to
achieve their theater objectives in that time. But these DoD components
do not know how much funding they will receive for SC under Title 10
beyond one or two years]{.underline} and can only speculate on what is
possible in the third, fourth, and fifth years. For example, Section
1203, a relatively new authority that allows U.S. general purpose forces
(GPF) to train with partner GPF (in a manner akin to the well-regarded
JCET program for SOF), is intended to enable training of U.S. forces
while furthering partnerships with foreign military forces. Yet [**[it
does not come with funding]{.mark}**, and **[must compete for]{.mark}
O&M [funds]{.mark} that are [sorely needed
elsewhere]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including for operational readiness of
U.S. forces.38 Representatives from a number of CCMDs have said they do
not use Section 1203 or, if they do, only rarely. With no funding, it is
difficult to assume it can be used in planning one year, much less five
years, hence.

To address these challenges, [the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense
for **[S]{.mark}ecurity [C]{.mark}ooperation** [has **focused on
improving**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**planning**,
**[prioritization]{.mark}**, and synchronization]{.underline} of Title
10 programs. These efforts have effectively postured the SC community to
address the significant reforms laid out in the FY 2017 NDAA.The FY 2017
NDAA identified SC as a core DoD mission by establishing a new chapter
of Title 10. This new SC chapter is meant to enhance flexibility,
transparency, oversight, and management of programs and resources;
professionalize the SC workforce; and improve the alignment of SC
activities with defense strategy. These new authorities provide DoD a
unique opportunity to transform SC into a more strategic U.S. national
security tool.

Specifically, the FY 2017 NDAA:

consolidates policy oversight and resource allocation within the Office
of the Secretary of Defense and consolidates execution and
administration of Title 10 Security Cooperation programs within DSCA;

requires the DoD to provide a consolidated budget justification [[and
establish an]{.mark} Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation
(**[AM&E]{.mark}**) [framework]{.mark} to allow a more rigorous,
data-driven assessment of program effectiveness]{.underline}; and

mandates the DoD establish a SC workforce development program to ensure
that the SC professionals all over the world have the appropriate
training, education and experience to execute the mission.

Comprehensive SC Reform Implementation

Together with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy,
the Joint Staff, and the DoS, DSCA has developed an operational approach
with four focus areas to implement SC reform mandated by the FY 2017
NDAA and to incorporate the Title 22 initiatives already underway. These
focus areas, with the broad participation and support of the
interagency, are designed to advance innovative policies and processes
to address the following issues:

Governance and Oversight to oversee SC efforts and ensure compliance
with legislative and policy requirements;

Policy Guidance to develop and issue policy to provide overarching
direction for implementation of SC activities;

Execution to define and implement changes to SC capabilities and
operations; and

Enabling Functions to perform operations required to support the
execution activities.

Work on SC reform is well underway to meet current challenges and the
requirements set forth in the FY 2017 NDAA.

Conclusion

[Now more than ever, policy makers use SC as a critical tool to achieve
our defense and foreign policy objectives. [With reduced]{.mark} U.S.
[force structure and **finite resources**]{.mark} in a dynamic, rapidly
evolving environment, it has become [increasingly important to
**optimize**]{.mark} allies\' and partners\' contributions to their own
security and, by extension, U.S. security]{.underline}. The language in
the FY 2017 NDAA provides the mandate to realize much needed reform to
SC.

For the last 70 years Security Cooperation has been a pillar of U.S.
foreign policy. We must not, however, rest on our laurels. Today, the
convergence of Congressional mandates with the Department\'s emphasis on
strengthening our partners is a call to action. We must seize this
opportunity to fortify our status as the Security Cooperation partner of
choice.

First, [the **[proliferation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and complexity [[of
**authorities**]{.mark} **[make it difficult to develop security
coop]{.mark}eration [initiatives]{.mark}** with partners, especially
ambitious efforts that integrate several types of activities requiring
multiple authorities. Every authority details different requirements and
constraints concerning which partners are eligible, under what
circumstances, and with what reporting requirements. **[Military
planners]{.mark}** in the field often [have **little
experience**]{.mark} managing security cooperation [and
**rotate**]{.mark} every two to three years, [while **more
experienced**]{.mark} **DoD [civilians]{.mark}** [are **few**]{.mark} in
number with perhaps a handful to support a combatant command. Many
[initiatives require several authorities using **different**]{.mark}
**sources of [funding]{.mark} on different [cycles]{.mark}** with
**different [processes]{.mark} and restrictions**, [and]{.mark}
**different congressional reporting [requirements]{.mark}**. Should
**funding for one of these authorities fall through**, major events may
be **canceled**]{.underline} or radically restructured. Despite its
value in helping deploy partners to Afghanistan, the Coalition Readiness
Support Program example discussed earlier provided only one of the five
authorities necessary to support four infantry battalions from the
country of Georgia. Similarly, it was one of only six authorities
required to loan Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to another
country. [In addition to the **inefficiencies** created by this
**patchwork** approach, the [**delays** and **changes**]{.mark} that
result [from]{.mark} associated **[planning problems]{.mark}** can
**generate confusion with partners** and **[setback]{.mark}s** in
strengthening [**relationships** and]{.mark} building a partner's
**[capabilities]{.mark}**. **[Even more-modest efforts]{.mark}** can
require multiple authorities, [leading]{.mark} some [planners to **avoid
smaller programs because they**]{.mark} **may [only have time for one or
two high-visibility efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Finally, greater
complexity has required greater involvement by DoD lawyers to interpret
what is and is not allowed, with different interpretations by different
individuals or organizations or at different times. For example, can a
particular maritime training event be considered a counterterrorism
effort? Can a particular exercise pay for certain civilians to attend?
Legal uncertainties like these have resulted in delays and
cancellations, generating further frustration and confusion between U.S.
and foreign military planners.

#### It's NOT a [one-shot]{.underline} deal -- it's an [ongoing, ever-expanding]{.underline} commitment to [thirty countries]{.underline} -- planners [perceive]{.underline} [multiplicative]{.underline}, NOT just [additive]{.underline}, [opportunity costs]{.underline} 

**Gold 21** Zack Gold, Ralph Espach, Douglas Jackson, and Nicholas

Cooperation Investments," Defense One, 6-16-2021,

/GoGreen!

Second, even if the returns were quantifiable, the real costs of
security cooperation for the U.S. military are often unmeasurable. For
example, [past analysis indicates]{.underline} that the structure of the
Navy's cost accounting system makes [it impossible to know the full,
exact cost of any security cooperation deployment or
activity]{.underline}. Additionally, [[there is **opportunity cost in
every decision** about **s**]{.mark}**ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation**]{.underline}. In Washington, [the focus in recent
years has been on realigning resources for **great power
competition**]{.underline}. However, each geographic combatant command
has dozens of partners. How, for example, can one accurately calculate
[the **[real and opportunity costs]{.mark}**]{.underline} of conducting
a bilateral exercise with Brazil as opposed to Colombia; or even with
the UAE navy versus the UAE armed forces?

Third, return on investment focuses on the wrong unit of analysis. By
trying to quantify the costs and returns of isolated security
cooperation activities, evaluations fail to capture the full context of
security cooperation with U.S. partners. [The U.S. conducts **security
cooperation** [as **integrated**, **iterative**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
[**mutually supporting [activities]{.mark}** [that involve **multiple
countries**]{.mark}]{.underline} or multiple elements of a single
country. For example, providing a patrol craft, training a crew, and
exercising patrol operations are all discrete security cooperation
activities, but which is responsible for building a partner's maritime
patrol capability---and can any of these activities achieve that desired
outcome without the others? [The outcomes of these activities
[are]{.mark} therefore **[not]{.mark}** an **[additive]{.mark}** result
of individual security cooperation activities, [**but**
often]{.mark}times a **[multiplicative]{.mark}** one]{.underline},
further reducing the utility of return on investment as a useful tool.

#### [Mission creep]{.underline} supercharges the link -- plan's [NATO-specific]{.underline} authorization will be [stretched]{.underline} by [non-NATO planners]{.underline} who [game the system]{.underline}

Similarly, [[authorities that **restrict activities to specific mission
areas**]{.mark} are **seen as inflexible** [in]{.mark} the face of
quickly **[emerging threats]{.mark}**, making it difficult to build
partner capacity in intended mission areas and further
**[impel]{.mark}ling [SC personnel to "game" the system to achieve
their]{.mark} SC [objectives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. After 2001 and
until recently, the priority for U.S. national security strategy and for
SC (and DoD activity in particular) has been counterterrorism.24
Congress established Section 1206 and many other recent SC authorities
on the basis of the need to rapidly respond (and help partners respond)
to threats from al-Qaeda and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and
the Levant (ISIL). But as the CT mission area has been addressed in the
past ten to 15 years, other missions have emerged that are becoming
priorities for the United States and its partners but that are not
explicitly covered under the CT rubric (or under "stability operations,"
another area addressed in authorities). These other [emerging areas
include **cyber** warfare and **"hybrid" warfare** of the type
**Russia** has utilized to subjugate eastern **Ukraine** and annex
Crimea]{.underline} (gaps are also addressed in a subsequent section of
this chapter). [Capstone DoD strategic planning guidance that defines
priorities and directs the efforts of the CCMDs also identifies
nontraditional threats, such as transnational border security, maritime
security, and foreign fighters]{.underline}.25 [[While]{.mark} Congress
and the administration have [created]{.mark} some **[specific programs
to bolster]{.mark}** Ukraine and eastern **[NATO]{.mark}**
allies]{.underline},26 [existing authorities **[do not provide]{.mark}

opportunities for active and reserve component units to participate in
coalition and multinational exercises. In struggling to meet its surge
requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military is falling short
in its ability to resource the steady-state deterrence and partner
enabling missions called for in the QDR strategy.41 To address this
shortcoming, President George W. Bush's 2008 budget contains proposed
funding for an additional end-strength increase of 92,000 troops for the
Army and Marine Corps by 2013.42 This increase is not only necessary
now, but also is required post-Iraq/Afghanistan. The Army must be
forthright and convincing with the nation's civilian defense leadership
about the future force structure required to meet the myriad of "Boots
on the Ground" tasks necessitated by an uncertain and complex
environment.43

From the faltering of the Iraqi security forces in the face of the
so-called Islamic State in 2014 to the current controversy surrounding
U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia, U.S. security sector assistance (SSA)
to allies and partners has undergone significant scrutiny and reform
recently. Jumpstarted by the FY 2017 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), one focus area of the SSA reform effort has been assessment,
monitoring, and evaluation (AM&E). Long a core component of
international development programming, the push to institutionalize AM&E
in SSA programming is a result of recent congressional and executive
branch efforts to increase accountability, transparency, and
empirically-driven planning and design into SSA in the pursuit of U.S.
interests and values.

[[**AM&E** is]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[the **weakest link** of
the]{.mark} SSA **[reform effort]{.mark}**, [**yet** it is the area that
could **most effectively help**]{.mark} the U.S. government measure the
impact and return on investment of the billions of dollars spent on SSA
programs]{.underline}. The SSA goals, however, are
ambitious---coordinating AM&E efforts and lessons across cross-funded,
multi-year, multi-sectoral programs to address national security and
broader foreign policy objectives. [[With]{.mark} policy and lawmakers'
[**attention focused on improving SSA**, there is a **window of
opportunity** for]{.mark} the primary SSA program
implementers]{.underline}, the Department of Defense
(**[[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and Department of State (DoS), to
leverage the lessons learned by the U.S. development
community---including the U.S. Agency for International Development
(USAID) alongside other private and non-governmental
organizations---[[to]{.mark} critically examine and **[strengthen
AM&E]{.mark}** for SSA]{.underline}.

#### [Short-term bias]{.underline} makes the [most useful AM&E]{.underline} particularly likely to get [deprioritized]{.underline} in the face of [plan's fiat]{.underline} of an [urgent new priority]{.underline}

[[**Resource challenges** to **s**]{.mark}**ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation**]{.underline} derive from fiscal constraints,
Operational Tempo (OPTEMPO), Global Force Posturing, and outdated
authorities. From a fiscal standpoint, the strategic environment [[will
make]{.mark} the task of **[addressing]{.mark}** our [**security
challenges** **problematic** **for the foreseeable
future**]{.mark}]{.underline}. DoD's 2007 budget is projected to be 3.9
percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As a percentage of GDP, DoD
outlays are historically low and have not kept pace with the growth of
GDP over the last 40 years.31 However, the rising costs of mandatory
government entitlement spending associated with Medicare, Medicaid, and
Social Security are projected to account for 11 percent of the U.S. GDP
by 2016 and will exert pressures on a budget that economic growth alone
is unlikely to alleviate.32 Entitlement obligations will likely result
in political pressure to further reduce defense discretionary spending
in order to forestall greater budget deficits. [Despite the constrained
fiscal environment, DoD outlays must continue to grow to meet our global
engagement requirements]{.underline}. This should be a continuous
strategic communication message implemented by DoD senior leadership to
Congress and the American people to counter a growing view that the
federal government already spends too much on national defense.33

[**Despite having the authority** to plan and conduct security
cooperation within their area of responsibility]{.underline} (AOR),
[**GCCs** currently **lack sufficient dedicated resources** to support
their **security cooperation strategy**]{.underline}. In addition,
existing resources are limited by multiple and conflicting policy and
legislation. [Up to **30 sources of funding** regulated by various
authorities and guidelines **are required to implement GCC security
cooperation strategies**]{.underline}.34 Security Assistance programs
like international military education and training (IMET), foreign
military financing (FMF), and financial management service (FMS) are
State Department funded, and COCOMs have limited ability through the
interagency process to influence where and how this money is spent.35
Other sources like Warsaw Initiative Funding (WIF) and Cooperative
Threat Reduction (CTR) funding support military exercises and capacity
building efforts but continue to come under increased program management
scrutiny. In the past, security cooperation funding by Service
Components has contributed significantly to COCOM plan execution.
However, [Service Chiefs face **growing fiscal
obligations**]{.underline}. As an example, the Army delayed submitting
its 2008-13 Program Objective Memorandum in an effort to avoid a QDR
strategy and resource mismatch.36 A mismatch still exists, and the Army
faces a growing problem in funding current equipment wartime reset
requirements and its modernization efforts. In recent congressional
testimony, the Army Chief of Staff outlined the Army equipment reset
bill at \$17.01 billion for FY 2007, with expected requirements beyond
2007 to be \$12 to \$13 billion per year though the conflict and a
minimum of 2 to 3 years beyond.37 Additionally, the Army will need
nearly \$200 billion for the Future Combat System and its associated
spin-off technologies to meet modernization requirements.38 [These
**[fiscal]{.mark} realities** suggest Service components **will have
fewer [resources]{.mark}** to dedicate to **security
cooperation**]{.underline}, as Service Chiefs, who already have less
interest in engagement programs, struggle to meet their Title 10
responsibilities to train, organize, and equip their forces.39 To
overcome these hurdles, funding streams must be consolidated and reforms
initiated that provide GCCs more influence in the allocation of funding
resources for security cooperation.

[**COCOMs** will [also]{.mark} likely face **continued challenges** in
finding **sufficient resources** in the form of **military
[personnel]{.mark}** to **conduct** **security cooperation**
programs]{.underline}. [The Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP)
does not apportion forces specifically for security
cooperation]{.underline}, and [they must come from forces assigned to a
COCOM's AOR or that temporarily deploy for engagement
activities]{.underline}.40 For the foreseeable future, the deployment
requirements to support the GWOT will continue to leave few
opportunities for active and reserve component units to participate in
coalition and multinational exercises. In struggling to meet its surge
requirements in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. military is falling short
in its ability to resource the steady-state deterrence and partner
enabling missions called for in the QDR strategy.41 To address this
shortcoming, President George W. Bush's 2008 budget contains proposed
funding for an additional end-strength increase of 92,000 troops for the
Army and Marine Corps by 2013.42 This increase is not only necessary
now, but also is required post-Iraq/Afghanistan. The Army must be
forthright and convincing with the nation's civilian defense leadership
about the future force structure required to meet the myriad of "Boots
on the Ground" tasks necessitated by an uncertain and complex
environment.43

In the long term, the Realigned Global Force Posture aimed at creating a
CONUS based expeditionary force could have negative consequences for
future shaping activities. The Army has typically provided over 60
percent of the support to the GCC engagement efforts through its forward
stationed forces.44 In Europe alone, Army restationing will reduce the
forward presence in Europe to only two permanent Brigade Combat Teams.
Potential GWOT commitments aside, this reduction in forward based forces
will either reduce USEUCOM's military exercise and training programs or
significantly increase transportation costs for CONUS based force
participation. Alleviating some of these issues will be the decision to
rotate forces to Bulgaria and Romania. General John Craddock, the new
Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), views this as an opportunity
to "focus on mil-to-mil activities that continue to build the military
capacities of new NATO Alliance and perspective Alliance countries along
with strategic partners in Eastern Europe and Eurasia."45 However, to
truly allow GCCs the predictable manning resources, TSCPs must be
integrated into the Global Force Management construct. The Army Force
Generation (ARFORGEN) model provides a great opportunity to make forces
available for GCC security cooperation requirements.

Resource challenges are also found in the numerous policy, regulatory,
and legislative constraints governing the execution of programs. In
testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, SACEUR General
James L. Jones said:

> Although the threats we face have changed dramatically, resources
> available for security cooperation, one of our key enablers in dealing
> with present day challenges, are still used as they have been since
> the Cold War. They are applied for deliberate, long-lead-time system
> built to address a single, enduring and predictable enemy.46

An example of outdated resourcing can be found in the authorities
enabling the military to train and equip partner nations. The GTEP,
while eventually successful, required funding from seven different
agencies and allied contributions delaying the program start by seven
months.47 Most State Department funded security assistance programs like
FMS require multiple years to be put in place. To overcome this, the
Bush administration sought and received limited authority to train or
equip other countries' militaries to respond to critical needs and meet
emergent threats and opportunities. Under a 2-year pilot program,
Section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2006 provided
\$200 million in authority for GCCs to build the capability of military
forces of a foreign country to conduct counterterrorist operations or
participate in or support stability operations.48 While a vast
improvement, the amendment still lacks elements the DoD requested, and
others desired. Key among these is the limitation on training only
national military forces vice border security and other security forces
engaged in counterterrorism and stability operations.49 In its Building
Global Partnerships Act of 2007, DoD submitted legislation for
congressional consideration to expand the type of forces that may be
trained and increase the funding ceiling to \$750 million while making
the 1206 authority permanent.50 The Act also seeks legislative
provisions to streamline the authorities to increase our partners'
capacities through logistical and material support. It contains requests
for permanent authorities to loan significant military equipment to
coalition partners participating in combined operations and to allow
GCCs to make grants of nonlethal excess defense articles.51 These
legislative proposals to increase authorities are critical to increasing
our partners' effectiveness and must be enacted, streamlined, and fully
funded.

Another example of legislative constraints exists with the DoD Regional
Centers. Legislatively, the centers are now able to fund only military
and civilian defense officials. Expanding the participant pool would
strengthen their ability to educate and network with those necessary to
counter ideological support for terrorism. In Middle East societies,
where religion is so deeply integrated, Imams with greater understanding
of democratic principles and common security challenges could be
influential with Muslim populations, thereby countering extremism.
Strategic communications could be further enhanced if influential
moderates with access to al-Jazzera were educated at the centers.
Lacking authority to waive costs for a broader pool of participants,
Regional Centers are unable to reach the influential audiences most
critical to U.S. interests. In the uncertain and rapidly changing
security environment we now face, we must not continue to embrace
outdated models and antiquated mindsets in dealing with allies and
partners. The flexibility offered by initiatives like partner capability
and capacity building legislation in the Building Global Partnerships
Act is a necessary start. To truly be effective, however, the United
States must completely reexamine the Foreign Assistance Act and
undertake broad reform of the ways in which we provide security
assistance.

Another growing challenge to security cooperation lies in the necessity
to properly assess and evaluate program effectiveness. [[In the]{.mark}
domestic strategic [environment of **scarce and competing**]{.mark}
**defense [resources]{.mark}**[, it will be **critical**]{.mark} for
COCOMs to **evaluate** their **security cooperation** programs [to
establish **priorities**, **defend funding**, and apply]{.mark} their
[resources where **most needed**]{.mark}. To date]{.underline}, the
submission of engagement **[plans]{.underline}** has [simply
served]{.underline} as a venue [to]{.underline} capture and [**inform**
the Joint Staff of what the COCOMs are doing **but fail to demonstrate
their effectiveness**]{.underline}.52 The 2005 Security Cooperation
Guidance outlining the requirement to conduct an annual assessment of
security cooperation activities in their AORs is a beginning. No
assessment guidance has been published by DoD, however.

Historically, the subjective nature of security cooperation has made it
very difficult to measure. Assessment has consisted mainly of capturing
and reporting outputs, including details such as the number of
exercises, students trained, and port calls have served as the measure
of program success. Assessment templates should require addressing
measures of performance, or how well a plan was executed and also how
well programs are aligned with priorities for creating and building
partnerships outlined in the Security Cooperation Guidance. [To **truly
transform security cooperation effectiveness**, however, one **must**
address the difficult task of **measuring effectiveness**]{.underline}.
Assessment plans should evaluate programs against broader cooperation
efforts.53 [COCOMs must begin to measure in terms of strategic outcomes,
measuring the effectiveness of how well their plans build partners and
capacity]{.underline}. The Building Partnership Capacity (BPC) Roadmap,
signed in May 2006 by Deputy Defense Secretary Gordon England to provide
a plan of action for implementing partnership capacity related QDR
decisions, may prove constructive if it improves DoD's ability to assess
security cooperation investments.54

While properly measuring effectiveness is vitally important to
prioritizing resources, caution must be taken to avoid a short-term
focus. [[The **emerging security environment** may lead to a]{.mark}
**significant [resource struggle]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} achieve a proper
**[balance]{.mark} between [short- and long-term programs]{.mark}**
[with respect to **measuring**]{.mark} the **effectiveness** of
attaining **security cooperation** objectives]{.underline}.
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark} steady [[**shift** to more
**immediate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, tangible, and measurable
[[outcomes]{.mark} from theater security programs [is
**likely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, a business mindset towards
assessments should not force policy practices to favor short term,
metric oriented programs that have quick and measurable tactical
effects. The difficulty of measuring security cooperation success
creates problems when evaluating progress over time. Many long-term
benefits in engagement programs that build partner will through trust
and mutual understanding exceed the scope of any single program and
progress more often comes from multiple programs conducted over many
years.55 Ongoing multifaceted cooperation in the GWOT is an example
where long-term U.S. military cooperation efforts have achieved valuable
outcomes. In congressional testimony, USEUCOM Commander General Jones
said:

> Since September 11, 2001, nearly every nation in the USECUOM AOR has
> offered or provided intelligence, basing access, and over-flight
> rights, forces, and equipment as well as other forms of key support in
> our efforts to combat terrorism. The degree of support we have
> received is directly related to the effort and attention we have given
> to the security cooperation program that was in place well in advance
> of the current conflict.56

In the security environment of uncertainty the United States faces,
long-term efforts to build and maintain a foundational base of security
partners through exercises, military education, and exchanges are wise
investments to hedge against future security challenges. Assessment
constructs must capture both short- and long-term returns.

environment necessitates; and a common lexicon around AM&E that DoD,
DoS, and USAID can all leverage as they seek to coordinate AM&E in SSA
programming.

AM&E is heavily dependent on data collection and synthesizing
information. [**[While]{.mark} DoD and DoS [collect]{.mark} a broad
array of [data]{.mark} for SSA programming** purposes, [it is]{.mark}
often [**inconsistent**, **incomplete**]{.mark}, and difficult to share
across agency lines. These issues are exacerbated by the complex
realities often found in SSA country contexts. [To mitigate such
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}, the SSA community can learn from and
leverage existing development models to design programs using multi-step
data collection processes that incorporate cross- and multi-sectoral
data to gather context specific data, such as environmental challenges,
political environment, or gender-related issues. Doing so effectively
[[will **require**]{.mark} SSA policymakers and [practitioners to
**prioritize AM&E**]{.mark} starting [from the]{.mark} design and
[**planning stages**, **not as an afterthought**]{.mark} to
action]{.underline}.

At a time when the United States is increasingly relying on foreign
partners for its security and attempting to build their military
capacity, security cooperation activities and expenditures can no longer
be justified with anecdotal evidence. In order to gauge security
cooperation's "return on investment," senior leaders in the presidential
administration and Congress are requesting a rigorous accounting of what
is being done, what is being spent, and what is being achieved and not
being achieved in relation to specific planning objectives across the
security cooperation enterprise. [Although many parts of the U.S.

CHAPTER EIGHT

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

As security cooperation continues to be an important instrument for the
Army to achieve its objectives, the Army needs a better understanding of
relative effectiveness. Part I of this report found that recent Army
security cooperation activities have aligned fairly well with what
previous analyses have found contribute to effectiveness in both
security cooperation and international development assistance. However,
[the **[lack of systematic AM&E]{.mark}** across]{.underline} Army
[**security cooperation** activities [has made it **impossible to
examine individual and aggregated activities in a way that truly drives
prioritization**]{.mark} **efforts**. [This
reflects]{.mark}]{.underline} both the inherent challenges that exist in
evaluating security cooperation and [[the **lack of**]{.mark} **robust
[AM&E processes throughout the]{.mark}**]{.underline} Army and
**[[DoD]{.underline}]{.mark}** more **[[broadly]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

**[OSD]{.underline}** has worked to improve DoD enterprise-wide security
cooperation AM&E procedures. Its recently released DoDI [[has]{.mark}
enumerated **[requirements]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are in keeping
with good practices adopted by international development organizations
and recognize the complexity of U.S. security cooperation in toto.1
[**[However]{.mark}**, OSD's focus has been [**at the policy level**
and]{.mark} its guidelines [serve primarily to]{.mark} provide
**[guid]{.mark}anc[e]{.mark}** for GCC
**[planners]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

To help the Army better plan and execute its security cooperation
activities, we developed AM&E implementation guidelines based on
emerging OSD guidance, current Army processes, and good practices
adopted by international development organizations. We expect the
primary users of this framework and portfolio tool will be ASCC
planners, while HQDA staff can use it in their oversight role. ASCC
planners serve as the primary interface between GCCs, the department of
the Army, and Army implementers. We believe that adopting the Army
security cooperation AM&E framework presented in this report will
provide a good foundation for deepening the Army's understanding of its
security cooperation effectiveness.

The Army's focus on deepening its security cooperation AM&E procedures
at the activity level can serve as a model for how DoD links its
strategic guidelines to operational planning. The Army's bottom-up
operational approach can be a valuable complement for OSD's top-down
strategic approach, particularly with the help of the framework and
portfolio tool developed in this report. Taken together, the OSD and
Army approaches form the basis for a comprehensive process that accounts
for strategic, operational, and tactical considerations in support of
decisionmaking.

### AT: N/U -- Deprioritized

Building accountable, effective, and resilient security institutions:
The United States, led by [the]{.underline} Department of Defense
(**[[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark}**), [[will work towards]{.mark} elevating,
[**prioritizing**, and **surging funds** to]{.mark} institutional
capacity building]{.underline} (ICB) [[activities to leverage
DOD's]{.underline}]{.mark} significant history of, and expertise in,
improving resiliency through support of democracy and
[**[anti-corruption efforts]{.mark}** with our global
partners]{.underline}. [DOD's ICB efforts, which also align [with
**NATO**]{.mark}'s Building Integrity program]{.underline}, are
particularly well-placed to simultaneously integrate key principles of
advancing democratic civil-military relations, building transparent and
resilient security sectors, and strengthening civilian leadership across
multiple institutional functional areas. In addition to continued
support to NATO's Building Integrity program, DOD will coordinate with
State and USAID and can adapt the approaches presently used in DOD ICB
to apply them more comprehensively toward democratization and
anti-corruption outcomes. [[This effort **will nest with** DOD's
**a**]{.mark}**ssessment, [m]{.mark}onitoring, [and e]{.mark}valuation
[framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as required by the FY17 NDAA. It will
also advance DOD's use of learning agendas [[to create **positive
feedback loops** and **better identify** new ways]{.mark} of
establishing responsible defense governance and internal controls in
order to help build [more **accountable**, **effective**]{.mark}, and
transparent defense institutions with partners]{.underline}.

[[The Department **has made significant reforms** to **align strategic
guidance** with **resource allocation**]{.mark}; [establish an]{.mark}
assessment, monitoring, and evaluation (**[AM&E]{.mark}**)
[program]{.mark}; and create a comprehensive, common picture of the
Department's budget for security cooperation activities]{.underline} as
well as related programs that engage foreign partners. This budget
display is a representation of the Department's progress to date in
achieving security cooperation reform and realizing congressional intent
in Title 10, Chapter 16, security cooperation.

Section 381(a) of Title 10, U.S. Code, requires a consolidated budget of
security cooperation programs and activities be included annually along
with the President's Budget request to Congress. The consolidated budget
display is intended to enhance planning and oversight of security
cooperation programs and related activities across the DoD. This annual
budget display demonstrates how DoD plans, programs, and budgets for
programs and activities to align with the Department's strategic
objectives.

[This budget display includes the \$3.7 billion requested by the
Department [for]{.mark} FY **[2023]{.mark}** to conduct security
cooperation programs and activities]{.underline}. It focuses primarily
on the funding requested for programs and activities that will be
executed under the authorities in Chapter 16 of Title 10, U.S. Code. It
also includes funding requests for non-Chapter 16 programs and
activities that include some elements or activities that are consistent
with the security cooperation definition, including the Coalition
Support Funds, the DoD Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) Program,
Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI), and the Counter-Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) Train and Equip Fund (CTEF). This display
excludes classified programs, such as programs authorized under Section
127e of Title 10, U.S. Code, "support of special operations to combat
terrorism." The budget display also excludes Drug Interdiction and
Counter-Drug activities authorized under Section 284(c) of Title 10,
U.S. Code, "Support for counterdrug activities and activities to counter
transnational organized crime."

[In 2017]{.underline}, Congress sought to address this conundrum through
the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). [[The NDAA
directed]{.mark} the Secretary of Defense [to implement]{.mark} an
Assessment, Monitoring, and Evaluation (**[AM&E]{.mark}**) framework to
improve the accountability [of **all s**]{.mark}**ecurity
[c]{.mark}ooperation** initiatives]{.underline}; something akin to what
PM/SA had been working on since 2015.\[v\] In theory, all security
cooperation initiatives should be assessed to ensure USG funds are being

Challenges

[**Too Hard to Integrate** with Existing Exercises]{.underline}. [Some
may say a]{.underline} biennial [exercise]{.underline} that includes all
GCCMDs and FCCMDs [is **unrealistic** [given the]{.mark} often
**[frantic op]{.mark}erations [tempo]{.mark}** [and **fiscal
constraints** that **burden DOD**]{.mark}. At present, **this is
true**]{.underline}. However, [reevaluating existing exercises
and]{.underline} either **[[canceling]{.underline}]{.mark}** or
integrating [them]{.underline} into the capstone exercise could
[[alleviate]{.mark} much of [the **additional burden** of a **new
mandatory requirement**]{.mark}]{.underline} for the Joint Staff and
CCMDs. Development of a TCE should follow the lessons learned from the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). [In the wake of the Crimea
crisis, **[NATO]{.mark}** quickly went from about 100 to 300 exercises
per year and **[reached the limit of]{.mark} the Allies' [ability to
support]{.mark} them**]{.underline}. [[**Instead of adding additional
exercises**, **NATO**]{.mark} is [now]{.mark} focused on increasing
their]{.underline} realism, [flexibility]{.underline}, and robustness.
[This change in thinking has allowed for NATO to plan and execute
faster]{.underline}.19 Likewise, a TCE provides an opportunity for
combatant commanders to set aside redundant training exercises while
keeping the intent of higher guidance providing a "less-is-more"
training option for the CCMD.

The first full biennial capstone exercise should not be executed until
2020 [to [**provide planners adequate lead time** to]{.mark} plan and
**[schedule]{.mark}** the exercise **[across DOD]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Furthermore, a TCE would have to be assigned priority event status to
ensure prioritization throughout DOD. [Once **[scheduled far in
advance]{.mark}**, planners should be able to schedule other events
[around an **established**]{.mark} battle
**[rhythm]{.mark}**]{.underline} that runs a TCE every other year, on
even years, starting in 2020.

**[Scheduling and Resources]{.underline}**. [Others might
argue]{.underline} that a TCE is just **[[another]{.underline}]{.mark}**
exercise [**[requirement]{.mark}** that **[takes away time]{.mark}**
they could spend on real-world issues]{.underline} and that [there is
**[not enough]{.mark} time and [resources to do
both]{.mark}**]{.underline}. **[DOD]{.underline}** and other agencies
[are **indeed** faced with fiscal challenges that have resulted in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [having the smallest Army,
Navy, and Air Force since World War II]{.underline}.20 At the same time,
[with the plethora of exercises already being executed, **finding a
time** that would work across the joint force **would be
difficult**]{.underline}. [To address this concern]{.underline}, the
Joint Staff and CCMDs should first establish a culture that recognizes
the value of a TCE and set it as a top training priority in order to
solidify support for aggressive exercise participation. Rotating through
the five key challenges in a variety of scenarios could further validate
the legitimacy of the exercise, as it would allow assigned CCMDs
synchronizing responsibilities to exercise against a variety of
benchmark threats. Despite the resource challenges, ensuring the
Secretary, Joint Staff, and all GCCMDs and FCCMDs participate in the
exercise is central to achieving proposed training objectives,
especially command and control and communications stress-testing. Each
GCCMD and FCCMD's unique capabilities and geographic expertise should be
represented in the exercise, and this would indeed pose the greatest
challenge to scheduling and execution.

[To address the resourcing issue, [it is **important to**]{.mark} **put
a [mark]{.mark} on [the calendar as soon as possible]{.mark}** [to
enable]{.mark} Global Force Management [processes **time to allocate any
shift in resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The Joint Staff and
**CCMDs** will also need to quickly determine **required staff** to
serve as role players and determine how best to meet this
need]{.underline}. Options for building the necessary training elements
could include assigning select staff a temporary duty assignment,
employing modular training teams, hiring short-term contractors, or
creating computer system simulations. For an exercise of this scale,
[new collaboration mechanisms among training elements might be required,
as **physical space**]{.underline} to house a training element of this
magnitude would likely not permit complete collocation. [[The **key** to
**addressing all of these challenges**]{.mark} would be **[sufficient
time for planning]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### AT: Thumper -- Ukraine

**[INTERNATIONAL SECURITY COOPERATION PROGRAMS ACCOUNT:]{.underline}**

The International Security Cooperation Programs (ISCP) Account funds
activities aimed at building partner capacity to address shared national
security challenges and operate in tandem with or in lieu of U.S.
forces. These efforts include train-and-equip programs to build partner
capability across a range of mission areas and institutional capacity
building to facilitate absorption, sustainment, and institutional
support necessary for capability development. Beginning in FY 2022, all
Institutional Capacity Building (ICB) programmatic activities previously
funded out of the Institute for Security Governance (ISG) and Institute
of International Legal Studies (DIILS) accounts are funded out of the
ISCP Account. The Department plans to use ISCP Account funds for
activities under section 332 ICB, section 333 (Train-and-Equip), and
P.L. 114-92 section 1263 (Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative).

[Security cooperation programs]{.underline} funded through the ISCP
Account [are prioritized across a range of factors, including strategic
alignment, program feasibility, and DoD component
prioritization]{.underline}. Geographic Combatant Commands develop and
submit requirements in the form of significant security cooperation
initiatives (SSCI), aligning proposed activities across five-year plans
and identifying complementary Department of State security sector
assistance activities (e.g., exercises, Foreign Military Financing,
Foreign Military Sales, etc.) that contribute to the effort's strategic
objective. [[Initiative-based **planning** supports **DoD's efforts** to

/GoGreen!

**[Q:]{.underline}** [And on an **[unexpected]{.mark}** announcement of
**[another round of assistance to Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}, could
you [walk us through any specifics]{.underline}, if you have any, on
that and when that\'s happening?

And just big picture on this: The U.S. has already given more than \$2.5
billion since this war started. [How long can the U.S. expect to
continue to bankroll so much of this war?]{.underline}

**[MS. PSAKI:]{.underline}** Well, okay, there\'s a couple questions
there, so let me do my best in answering them.

First, [we are working, of course, around the clock, as you know, to
provide security assistance to Ukraine]{.underline}. And just to give
you an example of how that assistance has flowed, just in the last few
days \-- and I think I gave an update the other day \-- but five flights
with military assistance have arrived in the region over the last few
days. More than half a dozen flights from the United States are
scheduled to land in the region shortly with additional equipment.

And as we look at providing this assistance, which I know \-- I\'ll go
back to the first part of your question, of course \-- but what we\'ve
tried to do \-- we made a strategic decision given we\'ve seen Russia
reposition their troops and their military to the eastern part of
Ukraine to fight a different kind of war on the ground, which will be
more, you know, kind of shooting back and forth through long range.

And so, [we have been working with]{.underline} Ukrainians and [the
Ukrainian military to determine exactly the kind of **[security
assistance]{.mark}** they need for this stage in the war. And that [has
included an **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as you\'ve seen,
[[in]{.mark} artillery and ammunition and [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline},
like Howitzers and others, that can do these sorts of \-- they can \--
are effective in this long-range shooting and long-range fighting that
we are seeing or we anticipate will happen in this stage of the war.

So, we have been expediting this assistance to the ground over the last
couple of weeks to ensure they are prepared as this \-- as this portion
of the war is starting \-- not because they are using all of it in in
seven days, but because we want them to have all of this equipment as
quickly as possible as they prepare to fight this war on the ground.

In terms of assistance and what we will be \-- what we\'re preparing or
the reports that I know have been out there, I will say I expect we\'ll
have more soon on this, but I have nothing to preview at this point in
time.

I would note that [**[out of the \$3.5 billion]{.mark}** in drawdown
authority [Congress granted]{.mark} for [this]{.mark} fiscal [year,
we\'ve **used**]{.mark} over [**\$2.4 billion** so far]{.mark} to
provide Ukraine the military equipment and capabilities they need to
defend themselves]{.underline}.

[[So]{.mark}, obviously, **[there\'s more of that]{.mark} approved
drawdown assistance that [we can provide]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And
we\'ve been working to expedite and ensure, as I noted, that it\'s
meeting exactly the needs they have at this point in the war.

#### Most of the stuff their ev's about comes from [DoS assistance, NOT DoD cooperation]{.underline} -- AND Congress has been adding [supplemental funding specific to Ukraine]{.underline} to cover it all regardless

June 1, 2022, the United States has provided more than \$7.3 billion in
security assistance "to help Ukraine preserve its territorial integrity,
secure its borders, and improve interoperability with NATO." [Since the

[**security assistance** to]{.mark} "provide [Ukraine]{.mark} the
equipment it needs]{.underline} to defend itself."

[FY2022 security assistance packages are [being **funded via more than

including the **Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations** Act,
2022]{.underline} (P.L. 117-103, Division N), [and the **Additional

billion** [to replenish]{.mark} Department of Defense (**[DOD]{.mark}**)
**[equipment]{.mark} stocks** sent to Ukraine via presidential
[drawdown]{.mark} authority]{.underline}; [**\$6.3 billion** for

Overview of Programs Since 2014

The United States has used a variety of security assistance programs and
authorities to help build the defensive capacity of the Ukrainian Armed
Forces (UAF) through train, equip, and advise efforts across multiple
spending accounts. Prior to the 2022 war, the two primary accounts were
the State Department's FMF (22 U.S.C. §2763) and DOD's USAI (P.L.
114-92, §1250) (see Table 2).

USAI packages have included training, equipment, and advisory efforts to
enhance Ukraine's defensive capabilities. FY2022 appropriations also
directed that USAI funds be provided for logistics support, supplies,
and services; salaries and stipends; sustainment; weapons replacement;
and intelligence support. Prior to FY2022, a portion of annual USAI
funds was contingent on DOD and State certifying Ukraine's progress on
key defense reforms.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [also has been providing

Weapons to Ukraine After Congress Replenishes Aid Funding," Yahoo!

[The Senate [gave final approval]{.mark}]{.underline} Thursday
[[on]{.mark} a multibillion-dollar bill that will extend the Pentagon\'s
[ability to ship weapons to Ukraine **the same day**]{.mark} **arms
[funding was set to dry up]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The Senate voted 86-11 to approve \$40 billion in security and
humanitarian aid for Ukraine, including nearly \$20 billion in Pentagon
funding to send more weapons to the front lines of the three-month-old
war with Russia and support U.S. troops stationed elsewhere in Europe.
All the \"no\" votes came from Republicans.

The bill, which already passed the House, is expected to be quickly
signed into law by President Joe Biden.

Biden administration officials had been warning they expected to exhaust
all of the existing funding to send weapons to Ukraine by Thursday,
potentially stalling the flow of arms amid fierce fighting in Ukraine\'s
eastern Donbas region. The Pentagon said the shipments will now continue
and could include new types of weapons, depending on what is requested
by the Ukrainians.

\"The future drawdown packages will probably, at least in terms of
frequency, look a lot like what we\'ve done in the past,\" Pentagon
spokesman John Kirby said. \"We now have some longer runway, and so
we\'re going to meter these out appropriately so that Ukraine is getting
what it needs in the fight that they\'re in, and that flight could
change over time.\"

Shortly after the Senate\'s vote, the Pentagon announced it was using
the last \$100 million of the previously approved funding to send
Ukraine another 18 howitzers, 18 tactical vehicles to tow the howitzers,
three counter-artillery radars, and field equipment and spare parts.

The bill approved Thursday gives the Pentagon another \$8.7 billion to
replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles being sent to Ukraine, as well as \$6
billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the program
Congress created in 2016 to buy weapons for and help train the Ukrainian
military.

Ahead of Thursday\'s vote, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., said the funding could help \"make sure that the Ukrainians are
victorious,\" an outcome that seemed far-fetched ahead of the invasion
\-- when U.S. intelligence was warning Kyiv could fall to the Russians
in days \-- but which lawmakers are increasingly saying should be the
goal of U.S. support to Ukraine.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States has committed
to sending about \$3.9 billion in weapons and other military equipment,
including thousands of Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger
anti-aircraft missiles, hundreds of Switchblade kamikaze drones, more
than 100 howitzers and more.

The bill also has \$3.9 billion for U.S. military operations in Europe,
including \"mission support, intelligence support, hardship pay for
troops deployed to the region and equipment including a Patriot
battery,\" according to a summary of the bill released by House
Appropriations Committee Democrats.

Thursday\'s bill [brings the **total U.S. funding** approved to bolster
**Ukraine** **during the war** to more than **\$53 billion**, about
**half** of which has been **for the Pentagon**]{.underline}.

[Congress butted up against the deadline to refresh funding despite
broad bipartisan support]{.underline} and hopes for a Senate vote
immediately after last week\'s House vote [because of Sen. Rand
Paul]{.underline}, R-Ky., [who would not agree to bypass lengthy Senate
procedures]{.underline} unless the bill included his amendment.

Paul wanted the bill to add language that would expand the role of an
inspector general for Afghanistan to include overseeing the Ukraine
funding. Senate leaders were willing to give him a vote on his
amendment, but Paul wanted the underlying bill to be rewritten to
include his proposal.

While Paul\'s proposal was not included, the bill approved Thursday does
require the Defense Department inspector general to conduct oversight of
the funding.

### AT: Thumper -- Taiwan

#### Taiwan does NOT thump -- it's [priced in]{.underline} -- [appropriated separately]{.underline} -- and there's a [massive backlog]{.underline} anyway, so new stuff just goes to the [bottom of the docket]{.underline} -- plus, [funding isn't implicated]{.underline} until it's cleared -- unlike plan's [fiated change in priorities]{.underline}

to Taiwan," Defense News, 4-14-2022,

/GoGreen!

Pandemic-related [acquisition issues have sparked [a **backlog**
in]{.mark} the U.S. [delivering]{.mark} \$14.2 billion worth of
[military equipment to **Taiwan**]{.mark} that the island has [purchased
**since 2019**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

With much of Washington's attention focused on how to rapidly deploy a
steady stream of military aid to Ukraine, some lawmakers are concerned
the Taiwan delay is undermining its ability to deter a potential Chinese
invasion.

Rep. Steve Chabot, the top Republican on the House's Asia and Pacific
panel, told Defense News that the Foreign Affairs Committee held a
meeting to discuss the backlog last week.

"We need to make sure that we provide Taiwan with the assistance that
they need as well so that they're not vulnerable to the \[People's
Republic of China\]," the lawmaker from Ohio said. "Obviously Ukraine is
in the limelight right now --- and rightfully so --- but we best not
forget about Taiwan because China's actions have been more and more
provocative."

Defense News has obtained [a spreadsheet detailing the **backlogged
equipment**]{.underline}, which [**[includes]{.mark}** Taiwan's \$8
billion purchase of 66 F-16 fighter jets as well as \$620 million to
replace expiring components of its Patriot missile system]{.underline}.

[The delayed deliveries also consist of]{.underline} smaller,
**[[asymmetric weapons]{.mark} systems]{.underline}** Washington
believes would be useful in deterring and thwarting a potential Chinese
invasion. China considers the self-governing island a rogue province and
has promised to bring it back under Beijing's control, by force if
necessary.

[Those asymmetric weapons include Stinger missiles, heavyweight
torpedoes, high-mobility artillery rocket systems, Paladin howitzers,
MS-110 reconnaissance pods and a field information communications
system]{.underline}. They also include \$2.37 billion in Harpoon Block
II surface-launched missiles and \$1 billion in air-launched SLAM-ER
missiles.

[The \$14.2 billion **backlog of sales** accounts for the **vast
majority** of the approximately **\$17 billion** in military equipment
**Taiwan agreed to purchase** from the United States **since July
2019**]{.underline}. The U.S. State Department notified Congress of
another \$95 million sale to provide contracting support for Taiwan's
Patriot missile system just last week. (Foreign Military Sales
notification **[[figures represent potential]{.mark} arms
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** that the State Department internally
clears. [They must then clear a congressional review period, during
which **[costs and quantities can change]{.mark}**]{.underline}.)

Neither the Defense Department nor Taiwan's diplomatic office in
Washington replied to Defense News' request for comment about the
backlog.

But Taiwan's envoy to the United States, Hsiao Bi-khim, raised the alarm
bells on Capitol Hill last week in a bid to urge Washington to address
the backlog.

Hsiao addressed it during a breakfast with Rep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas,
the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and pushed
for Taiwan's inclusion alongside the U.S. and more than two dozen other
participants in the biennial Rim of the Pacific naval exercises off the
coast of Hawaii.

"Her biggest complaint to us is that while we have notified and signed
off on these systems, they have yet to be delivered to Taiwan," McCaul
told the State Department's No. 2 diplomat, Wendy Sherman, during a
hearing last week on the Indo-Pacific region.

He likened Taiwan's position vis-a-vis China to that of Ukraine in the
lead-up to the Russian invasion.

"Is Taiwan able to defend herself?" McCaul asked. "I think the answer is
'no' right now, and I'm worried about that. I don't want to make the
same mistake of waiting until after an invasion because that's going to
be too late."

However, [it remains unclear what --- if anything --- the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can do to address the
pandemic-related acquisition issues that prompted the
backlog]{.underline}.

["Our primary issue --- and we see this playing out in Ukraine also ---
is that the industry has been delayed in the development of these
systems,"]{.underline} a Republican staffer on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee told Defense News.

The staffer also noted the U.S. defense industry has attributed supply
chain issues, staff shortages and shipping delays to COVID-19 ---
problems that have cascaded into broader production troubles.

"Honestly, the bottom line is there is very little that the government
can do at this juncture to address supply chain issues," Rupert
Hammond-Chambers, the president of the US-Taiwan Business Council, told
Defense News.

Hammond-Chambers pointed to the federal government's inability to
address semiconductor supply chain issues that contributed to higher car
prices around the globe.

["There's a great deal of political and international pressure to sort
it out, but [it's having]{.mark} almost **[negligible
impact]{.mark}**]{.underline} on the ability of the companies to produce
the chip that is necessary for the auto industry," he said.

Prior to the backlog, [**[Congress]{.mark}** had largely [remained
focused on **incentivizing Taiwan**]{.mark} to make cheaper purchases
consisting of large quantities of asymmetric munitions]{.underline}
versus the more expensive, state-of-the-art weapons that China may
quickly incapacitate during an invasion.

And while much of Taiwan's U.S. defense purchases bolster its asymmetric
capabilities --- including many of the backlogged articles --- some in
Washington raised their eyebrows in 2019 when Taipei opted to move ahead
with a \$2 billion purchase of Abrams tanks.

"The United States encourages Taiwan to purchase weapons that will
enable \[it\] to adopt a strategy of denial that will prevent China from
being able to seize and control Taiwan, so that it will not have the
confidence to do so and therefore will not be tempted to do so," Bonnie
Glaser, the Asia Program director at the German Marshall Fund, told
Defense News.

For instance, Chabot [introduced a bill last year]{.underline} with Rep.
Ami Bera, D-Calif., [calling on Taiwan to further invest in asymmetric
defense capabilities]{.underline}.

Sen. James Risch, R-Idaho, the ranking member on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, [has also [introduced **a bill** to
**authorize**]{.mark} **\$2 billion a year in [Taiwanese military
aid]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but only if Taipei produces long-term plans
for joint capability development with the United States.

**[Another bill]{.underline}**, introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo.,
[would **authorize \$3 billion in Taiwanese military aid**
annually]{.underline}. The bill would place more explicit requirements
stipulating the funding go toward developing Taipei's asymmetric defense
capabilities against China.

The Biden administration has also encouraged Taiwan to invest more in
its asymmetric capabilities, even as many of those munitions remain
backlogged.

"We are also encouraging Taiwan to focus on capabilities that would
deter the \[People's Republic of China\] from taking Taiwan by force,"
Sherman said during her testimony before Congress last week. "This means
a focus on capabilities that are cost-efficient, mobile, lethal,
resilient and capable of operating and surviving a contested
environment."

Pivot from Asia

[Some suggest [**fears** of China invading Taiwan]{.mark} in concert
with a Russian invasion of Ukraine [are **unfounded**]{.mark} and have
been [fueled by **overheated rhetoric**]{.mark}]{.underline} from both
sides.

**[C]{.mark}**ooperation **[A]{.mark}**gency [and defense attache in
Beijing]{.mark}, [said]{.mark} he sees **[simultaneous
invasion]{.mark}s** [of]{.mark} Ukraine and **[Taiwan]{.mark}** as
**[unlikely]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

"I assess [[there's **always a probability of simultaneous
crises**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and honestly, I believe that the Chinese
are watching this current situation very carefully. They will watch to
see what \[the\] Russians do, watch the world react, internalize the
lessons learned and then subsequently incorporate that into their own
strategy," Hooper said at a virtual event on Tuesday. "[**[So]{.mark}**,
in other words, [I **don't see things happening
simultaneously**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[Even if the U.S. won't commit troops to defend Ukraine,
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline} should not --- and likely [**[will
not]{.mark}** --- [see that as a green light]{.mark} for China to invade
Taiwan, said Ian Bremmer, president of political risk consultancy
Eurasia Group]{.underline}. America has signaled Taiwan is off-limits
through its new security pact with Australia and the U.K., the
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, its strengthened diplomacy with Taiwan
and this week's naval exercises with Japan, he argued.

"If anything, the takeaway the Chinese would get from everything over
the last year is that America is focused on the areas they care about.
Asia is the place they care about and China is the adversary they're
concerned about," Bremmer said. "We're both sending signals to each
other there here are some fairly significant red lines we both have."

#### "Strategic competition" is [meaningless]{.underline} and [counterproductive]{.underline}

**Nexon 21** Daniel H. Nexon, Professor in the Department of Government
and at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown
University, "Against Great Power Competition," Foreign Affairs,

/GoGreen!

In his first days in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has worked to
signal a clean break with his predecessor. He rejoined the Paris climate
accord, offered to extend the New START nuclear weapons treaty, and
reversed the "Mexico City" policy curtailing overseas abortion access.
His appointees have repeatedly emphasized that the administration will
prioritize diplomacy and multilateralism over former President Donald
Trump's "America first" nationalism.

But the fate of a central plank of Trump's foreign policy remains
uncertain: the focus on great-power competition, which according to his
administration's National Security Strategy has "returned." In a major
address at the U.S. State Department, Biden underscored his intention to
"work with Beijing when it's in America's interests to do so," but days
later noted the likelihood of "extreme competition" with China. This
rhetoric may reflect either pragmatism or that great-power competition
is on its way to assuming a dominant place in Biden administration
policy. [Even if Biden aims to de-emphasize competition in certain
areas]{.underline}, though, Republicans are certain to criticize the
administration for being weak and ineffective in the face of
international challenges. Absent some major change in the global threat
environment, [great-power competition will remain a focal point in
debates]{.underline} over U.S. foreign and national security policy.

[This is unfortunate]{.underline}. For all the concept's influence in
recent years, [**[g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower [c]{.mark}ompetition**
[is **not**]{.mark} a **[coherent]{.mark}** framework]{.underline} for
U.S. foreign policy. [Treating it as a guiding principle of American
grand strategy risks **[confusing means and ends]{.mark}**, [**wasting
limited resources** on **illusory threats**]{.mark}, [and **undermining
coop**]{.mark}**eration** [on **immediate security challenges**]{.mark},
such as **climate change** and **nuclear
nonprolif**eration]{.underline}. In the long run, [a [**fixation** on
**g**]{.mark}**reat-[p]{.mark}ower [c]{.mark}ompetition** is [likely to
**undermine, rather than enhance**]{.mark}, U.S. **[power]{.mark} and
influence**]{.underline}.

THE PROBLEM WITH COMPETITION

According to the Trump administration's 2018 National Defense Strategy,
"Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary
concern in U.S. national security." Just a year later, the analyst Uri
Friedman observed in The Atlantic that great-power competition was now
"invoked from Aspen to Israel to South Korea, and by U.S. officials
making the case for all sorts of policies." The phrase, he noted, "has
even achieved hallowed acronym status" in the form of "GPC." Some in
Washington see it as a sequel to the original Cold War, with China
taking over for the Soviet Union. Others look to more traditional
geopolitical rivalries as a model.

Great-power competition's newfound popularity reflects real facts on the
ground. Indeed, [competition among great powers cannot return, because
it never really went away]{.underline}. Rivalries between leading states
exist in every international system. Even during the 1990s---the height
of the "unipolar moment"---the United States and Russia competed in the
Balkans; the United States and France competed in parts of Africa; and
multiple states competed for influence in Central Asia.

But with Washington's unipolar status now on the wane, powers such as
China and Russia find it easier than they once did to challenge U.S.
leadership. Since states tend to consider overt antagonism a more
attractive option when they expect to come out on top, there will
inevitably be more competition among great powers as U.S. relative power
declines. With Washington on the back foot, foreign leaders see a chance
to gain economically, advance their security interests, and challenge
existing norms, rules, or their position in the international pecking
order.

[It is one thing]{.underline}, though, for Washington [to observe
increasing competition among great powers and adjust to a world in which
it enjoys less influence than it once did. It is another entirely to
elevate competition itself to the guiding paradigm of U.S. foreign
policy---as]{.underline} the Trump administration proposed and [Biden
may wind up doing]{.underline}. [[The **mere fact** of a]{.mark} more
**[competitive]{.mark} international [environment]{.mark}** [does **not
compel**]{.mark} states to engage in **[unrelenting struggle]{.mark}**.
[Instead]{.mark}, periods of **intense interstate rivalry** [happen
when]{.mark} great powers **[choose]{.mark}**---sometimes as a matter of
grand strategy, other times [through]{.mark} the **[accretion of
individual tactical decisions]{.mark}**---[to **prioritize conflict over
coop**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. **[[Nothing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
for instance, [[requires]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[to **push back** against **every peripheral
challenge**]{.mark} to its influence, status, or policy preferences.
[**Not every move** by **Moscow** or **Beijing** **constitutes
a**]{.mark} **direct [threat]{.mark}** to Washington's national
interests]{.underline}.

[It is also [**misguided** to think]{.mark}]{.underline}, as some have
suggested, [that **[g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower [c]{.mark}ompetition**
[makes]{.mark} norms, [**rules**, and]{.mark} other aspects of
**international [order]{.mark}** (**[liberal or otherwise]{.mark}**)
**[irrelevant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even during the Cold War, the
United States and the Soviet Union worked out a variety of formal and
informal rules that helped them manage competition, limit nuclear
proliferation, and otherwise structure international relations. Breaking
those rules meant real reputational costs, as the number of covert
interventions during the Cold War attests. Both sides of the conflict
faced stiff resistance when they violated norms of sovereignty or
national self-determination.

These norms, rules, and institutions often complement power politics.
They serve as both objects and instruments of great-power contestation.
In the nineteenth century, for instance, the German statesman Otto von
Bismarck appealed to shared norms in a successful effort to reduce
European resistance to German unification. Today, the United States
draws much of its relative power from institutional
arrangements---notably its unrivaled network of alliances and
partnerships---that frequently reflect and derive legitimacy from
liberal values.

These relationships underscore a central problem with treating
great-power competition as the organizing principle of foreign policy:
it provides very little in the way of guidance to policymakers. [[There
is **no single**]{.mark} **grand [strategy]{.mark}** for eras of
great-power competition. There are **[no instruments]{.mark}** of
statecraft **[that competition renders relevant]{.mark} or irrelevant**.
Great-power competition **[doesn't even imply]{.mark}** adopting a more
**[antagonistic approach]{.mark}** to rivals]{.underline}: as U.S.
President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev realized by
1987, [the best response to intensifying competition may be to dial
tensions back through confidence-building measures and
cooperation]{.underline}.

[Such **[indeterminacy]{.mark}** helps [explain]{.mark} the concept's
widespread [appeal]{.mark}: one **[can use g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower
[c]{.mark}ompetition [to justify]{.mark} almost
[anything]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the 1990s, the United States needed
enormous military budgets to prevent the emergence of new great-power
competitors. Now it needs them to compete with existing ones. Liberals
once called for major investments in infrastructure, education, and
research to sustain American primacy. Now they call for them to keep the
United States competitive in a multipolar world. Great-power competition
might require strategic retrenchment, or offshore balancing, or deep
engagement. [**Perhaps** it means that Washington must **give up its
liberal illusions** and pursue unbridled and **unilateral realpolitik**.
**Or maybe** the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [needs to
commit to **multilateralism** and more equitable relationships with
**allies**]{.underline}.

#### Their impact theorizations [overstate]{.underline} the [scope]{.underline} of competition -- it's [NOT all-encompassing]{.underline}, [revisionism is selective]{.underline} -- our [advantages]{.underline} have [greater explanatory power]{.underline} -- theirs [backfire]{.underline}

/GoGreen!

"America is back," blared headlines following President Joe Biden's
speech to the Munich Security Conference in February, an address clearly
designed to draw a line under the Donald Trump presidency and mark a new
start in trans-Atlantic relations. "We are not looking backward," Biden
promised. "We are looking forward, together." Yet one big plank of the
Trump administration's foreign policy is apparently sticking around:
great-power competition. "We must prepare together for a long-term
strategic competition," Biden told conference attendees, adding that
"competition with China is going to be stiff."

Unfortunately, [for all that **[g]{.mark}reat-[p]{.mark}ower
[c]{.mark}ompetition** has been Washington's **favorite
buzzword**]{.underline} in recent years, [it remains frustratingly
**[poorly defined]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, most [commentators
[skip]{.mark} right [past]{.mark} the big questions (Why are we
competing? **[Competing over what?]{.mark}**)]{.underline} [[and **go
straight to**]{.mark} arguing about **[how to achieve
victory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the possible answers to these
questions range from the entirely reasonable (i.e., that Western states
should engage in collective defense of liberal democracy) to the
dangerous and utterly unrealistic (i.e., that Washington should be
pursuing regime collapse in Beijing), it's hardly something we should
ignore.

It seems that once again---[**[just as]{.mark}** it did during the
**[g]{.mark}lobal [w]{.mark}ar [o]{.mark}n [t]{.mark}errorism** in the
mid-2000s [or]{.mark} when styling the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as **[the indispensable nation]{.mark}** in the
1990s---Washington's strategic community is again reorienting itself
around [a new, **poorly theorized model**]{.mark} of the world and of
America's place in it]{.underline}. [Yet precisely because it
[is]{.mark} so ill-defined, **great-power competition as a
strategy**---that is to say, competition for its own sake---also has the
potential to be **highly dangerous**]{.underline}.

It is a mark of how recently the notion of great-power competition has
entered the Washington lexicon that someone who had fallen into a coma
just five years ago might never have heard the phrase. Though the Obama
administration's 2015 National Military Strategy warned of states
"attempting to revise key aspects of the international order," it was
not until the Trump era that the term itself entered widespread use.
Then-U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis said in June 2017 that a
"return to great-power competition ... places the international order
under assault," while the National Security Strategy released later that
year noted that "after being dismissed as a phenomenon of an earlier
century, great power competition returned." Since then, its growth has
been exponential.

[As a description, great-power competition is accurate; competition
among the great powers is a defining feature of the international
environment]{.underline}. Whether one is talking about 16th-century
rivalries among empires, the imperialist scramble for Africa, or the
Cold War struggle between the capitalist and communist blocs, states
have always jockeyed for power and influence. [But the notion that it is
**new**---or that it is **returning** as if history were taking its
revenge---is somewhat **[absurd]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the
Georgetown University professor Daniel Nexon recently put it,
"[competition among great powers cannot return, because it never really
went away]{.underline}."

[Instead, the "return of great-power competition" is essentially an
easier way of admitting that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is in relative decline]{.underline}. [The
**unipolar moment**]{.underline}---the three-decade period of U.S.
global predominance that started with the collapse of the Soviet
Union---[is **ending**]{.underline}. In the parlance of political
science, [other states are beginning to **balance against** the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. In layman's terms,
this means that with the United States in relative decline, other states
are increasingly willing to take actions they would not have during the
1990s, [whether it's **Russian intervention**]{.underline} in Syria,
[**Chinese** claims to the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}, or
European steps to circumvent U.S. sanctions legislation. Irving Kristol,
considered the godfather of neoconservatism, once noted that a
neoconservative is just a liberal who's been mugged by reality; some of
the loudest voices proclaiming an era of great-power competition are
just liberal internationalists who have been mugged by the reality of
power politics.

[Yet **if this were all there was to it**, the **debate** surrounding
great-power competition would be **far less problematic**. Scholars and
pundits would **update** their **mental models** for a **more
competitive world** and **move on** with their lives]{.underline}.
[**Instead**, foreign-policy circles]{.underline} in Washington [are
increasingly **fixated** on the notion that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [**must commit to competition** with China, Russia,
and other states]{.underline}.

Great-power competition is portrayed less as a fact of life and more as
a strategy in and of itself. Certainly, some authors do suggest a
potential endpoint to great-power competition, such as Hal Brands and
Zack Cooper, whose recent piece in Foreign Policy argued that
competition between the United States and China would only lessen when
the regime in Beijing collapsed. [But they are **[still
unclear]{.mark}** on [**why** we should pursue an
**existential**]{.mark} Cold War-style **[struggle]{.mark}** with China,
[rather than]{.mark} a more measured approach of **[competitive
coexistence]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

This example is emblematic of the debate on great-power competition as a
whole. [As a grand strategy]{.underline}---what the Yale University
professor John Lewis Gaddis once described as "the calculated
relationship of means to large ends"---[**great-power competition** is
**sorely lacking**]{.underline}. For starters, it's [**not clear**
whether **competition** is itself a **means** or an
**end**]{.underline}.

The 2017 National Security Strategy, for example, describes the world as
an "arena of continuous competition" for which the United States must
prepare. Whether it is domestic infrastructure projects, student loan
forgiveness, repairs to democratic institutions, or increasing the birth
rate, a wide range of policy priorities are now portrayed as essential
to the pursuit of great-power competition. This suggests that
great-power competition is itself an end. Why the country is compelled
to compete in this way typically goes unstated.

Indeed, [[if]{.mark} great-power competition is instead [a
**means**]{.mark} to an end, it's **[not at all clear what]{.mark} those
[ends are]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There's [**rarely a concrete goal**
among those who proselytize]{.underline} in favor of a strategy of
great-power competition. Consider how the topic is portrayed by former
National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster in his recent book. He opens by
noting that "after the end of the Cold War, America and other free and
open societies forgot that they had to compete to keep their freedom,
security, and prosperity" while later arguing that states must "compete
thoroughly as the best means of avoiding confrontation."
[Confusingly]{.underline}, he [[portrays **competition** as **both** an
**alternative to conflict** and]{.mark} as [a **Manichean
struggle**]{.mark} **between good and evil**, with the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[beset by
adversaries]{.underline}** on all sides.

[It's easy to dismiss this kind of rhetoric as **silly**, but it also
carries **substantial danger**]{.underline}. For one thing, the [focus
on competition **[masks]{.mark} a whole series of underlying
[assumptions]{.mark}** about the international system and America's role
in it]{.underline}. Washington's policy community appears convinced that
we are headed for a more dangerous world, one in which the United States
must push back against the perceived aggression of states like China and
Russia. Though articles almost always include an obligatory aside---that
cooperation with China on climate change is a must!---the frame is
almost uniformly confrontational.

To be clear, there are good reasons for Washington's strategic community
to perceive an increasingly competitive world. The gap between the
United States and other countries is narrowing militarily; it has
already closed by some economic measures. And pushback against U.S.
foreign-policy choices among other states has increased in recent years,
from Chinese attempts to revise maritime rules to Russia's aggressive
targeting of foreign elections. [But a more competitive world **[isn't
the same thing as an all-out struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Great-power competition is often portrayed as an **all-or-nothing
conflict**, [where **revisionist autocracies** are **challenging** the
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[in
every sphere]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[In
reality]{.underline}]{.mark}**, thus far [[**China** and **Russia** are
**only selectively revisionist**]{.underline}]{.mark}, attempting to
change the status quo where it suits their interests and to maintain it
in other places.

[The [**risks** of the **all-or-nothing approach**]{.mark} to global
politics **[cannot be overstated]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Fareed
Zakaria put it recently, "The United States [risks **squandering the
hard-won gains from four decades of engagement** with
China]{.underline}, encouraging Beijing to adopt confrontational
policies of its own, [and leading the world's two largest economies into
a treacherous conflict of unknown scale and scope]{.underline}." Indeed,
[if one assumes---as]{.underline} much of the [writing on great-power
competition does---that China and Russia are implacable foes of the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [determined to destroy the
existing order and overturn U.S. hegemony, then policies that would
otherwise be unthinkable are suddenly on the table]{.underline}.

[[**Military buildup** in **Europe** and **Asia** becomes necessary,
even if it **raises**]{.mark} **the [risk of open conflict with another
nuclear power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Economic decoupling** seems
vital to protect supply chains, though studies show that the
**costs**]{.underline} to U.S. companies and workers [would be
**extreme**]{.underline}. A recent report by the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce's China Center, for example, estimated that the U.S. economy
could lose up to \$1 trillion in growth if tariffs were more broadly
applied to all U.S.-China trade. Restrictions on tourism or on Chinese
students studying in the United States would cost between \$15 billion
and \$30 billion per year.

[The bottom line is simple: It's easy to make fun of great-power
competition as a **meaningless buzzword** or as Washington's
foreign-policy elite rediscovering that other states get to have a say
in world politics. But]{.underline} as the political scientist Robert
Kagan wrote recently, the biggest question of the coming decades may be
whether countries can "confine the global competition to the economic
and political realms and thus spare themselves and the world from the
horrors of the next great war or even the still frightening
confrontations of another cold war." In that context, the blind pursuit
of a strategy of great-power competition is irresponsible and
shortsighted.

The [last time the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**single-mindedly pursued a poorly thought-out slogan masquerading as a
strategy**, it ended up fighting a two-decade global war on terrorism, a
conflict from which it is still struggling to extricate itself and that
had **immense negative effects** on]{.underline} the country's [foreign
relations]{.underline} and its domestic liberties. [Yet if today's
leaders are not careful, the **rhetoric of great-power competition**
could **drag the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**into
a conflict** even more costly and damaging]{.underline}.

The Indispensable Nation

Although geopolitical fear prevents current international empirical
realities from receiving a fair evaluation by U.S. society, another
belief prescribes a specific approach to foreign policy, one that
mandates a far higher level of international activism than would
otherwise be warranted. Both are based on thin intellectual foundations,
and together they encourage a variety of ill‐​advised policies on the
part of the United States. According to what might be considered the
indispensability fallacy, [many Americans believe]{.underline} that
[U.S. actions are primarily responsible for any stability that currently
exists]{.underline}. "All that stands between civility and genocide,
order and mayhem," explain Lawrence Kaplan and William Kristol, "is
American power."37 That [belief is an offshoot]{.underline}, witting or
not, [of]{.underline} what is known as "[hegemonic stability
theory]{.underline}," which proposes that international peace is
possible only when one country is strong enough to make and enforce a
set of rules.38 Were U.S. leaders to abdicate their responsibilities,
that reasoning goes, unchecked conflicts would at the very least bring
humanitarian disaster and would quite quickly threaten core U.S.
interests.39

[Brzezinski is typical in his [belief that]{.mark} "outright chaos" and
a string of specific horrors could be expected to follow a loss of
hegemony, from [renewed attempts to build regional empires]{.mark} (by
China, Turkey, Russia, and Brazil) to the collapse of the U.S.
relationship with Mexico]{.underline} as emboldened nationalists south
of the border reassert 150‐​year‐​old territorial claims. Overall,
[[without U.S. dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}, today's [relatively
peaceful world would turn "violent and bloodthirsty]{.underline}."40 The
[[liberal]{.mark} world [order]{.mark}]{.underline} that is so
beneficial to all [[would come tumbling down]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Like many believers, proponents of hegemonic stability theory base their
view on faith alone.41 [[There is]{.mark} precious **[little
evidence]{.mark}** to suggest [that the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is **responsible** for]{.mark} the **[pacific trends]{.mark}** that
have swept across the system]{.underline}. In fact, the [[world
remained]{.mark} equally [peaceful]{.mark}]{.underline}, relatively
speaking, [[while]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[cut]{.mark} its [forces]{.mark}
throughout the 19**90s**]{.underline}, [[as well as while it
doubled]{.mark} its military [spending]{.mark}]{.underline} in the first
decade of the new century.42 [Complex statistical methods should **not**
be **needed** to demonstrate]{.underline} that [levels of U.S. military
spending have been essentially **unrelated** to **global
stability**]{.underline}.

[Hegemonic stability theory's flaws go way beyond]{.underline} the
[absence of simple correlations]{.underline} to support them, however.
The [theory's supporters have never been able to explain adequately how
precisely 5 percent of the world's population could force peace on the
other 95 percent]{.underline}, unless, of course, the rest of the world
was simply not intent on fighting. Most [[states are]{.mark} quite
**[free to go to war]{.mark}** without U.S. involvement [but **choose
not to**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can be counted on, especially after Iraq, to
**steer** well **clear** of **most civil wars** and ethnic
conflicts]{.underline}. It took years, hundreds of thousands of
casualties, and the use of chemical weapons to spur even limited
interest in the events in Syria, for example; surely internal violence
in, say, [most of Africa would be unlikely to attract serious attention
of the world's policeman, much less intervention]{.underline}. The
continent is, nevertheless, more peaceful today than at any other time
in its history, something for which U.S. hegemony cannot take credit.43
[[Stability **exists**]{.underline}]{.mark} today [[in **many**]{.mark}
**such [places]{.mark}** to [which **U.S. hegemony**]{.mark} simply
**[does not extend]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Overall, proponents of the stabilizing power of U.S. hegemony should
keep in mind one of the most basic observations from cognitive
psychology: rarely are our actions as important to others' calculations
as we perceive them to be.44 The so‐​called [[egocentric
bias]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is essentially ubiquitous in human
interaction, [[suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [although it may be
natural for **U.S. policymakers** to interpret their role as crucial in
the maintenance of world peace, [they are]{.mark} almost **certainly
[overestimating]{.mark}** their [own **importance**. Washington
is]{.mark} probably [**not as central** to]{.mark} the **myriad
[decisions]{.mark}** [in **foreign capitals**]{.mark} that help maintain
international stability [as it **thinks it is**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The indispensability fallacy owes its existence to a couple of factors.
First, although all people like to bask in the reflected glory of their
country's (or culture's) unique, nonpareil stature, [Americans have long
been exceptional in their exceptionalism]{.underline}.45 The short
history of the United States, which can easily be read as an almost
uninterrupted and certainly unlikely story of success, has led to a
(perhaps natural) belief that it is morally, culturally, and politically
superior to other, lesser countries. It is no coincidence that the
exceptional state would be called on by fate to maintain peace and
justice in the world.

Americans have always combined that feeling of divine providence with a
sense of mission to spread their ideals around the world and battle evil
wherever it lurks. It is that sense of destiny, of being the object of
history's call, that most obviously separates the United States from
other countries. Only an American president would claim that by entering
World War I, "America had the infinite privilege of fulfilling her
destiny and saving the world."46

Although many states are motivated by humanitarian causes, no other
seems to consider promoting its values to be a national duty in quite
the same way that Americans do. "I believe that God wants everybody to
be free," said George W. Bush in 2004. "That's what I believe. And
that's one part of my foreign policy."47 When Madeleine Albright called
the United States the "indispensable nation," she was reflecting a
traditional, deeply held belief of the American people.48 Exceptional
nations, like exceptional people, have an obligation to assist the
merely average.

Many of the factors that contribute to geopolitical fear ---
Manichaeism, religiosity, various vested interests, and neoconservatism
--- also help explain American exceptionalism and the indispensability
fallacy. And [unipolarity makes hegemonic delusions possible. With the
great power of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [comes a
sense of great responsibility]{.underline}: to serve and protect
humanity, to drive history in positive directions. More than any other
single factor, the [people of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [tend to **believe** that they are
**indispensable** because they are **powerful**, and [power tends to
\[**obfuscate**]{.mark}\]]{.underline} ~~blind~~ [[states to]{.mark}
their **[limitations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "Wealth shapes our
international behavior and our image," observed Derek Leebaert. "It
brings with it the freedom to make wide‐​ranging choices well beyond
common sense."49 [It is **quite likely** that the [world does **not
need**]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to **enforce
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact[, [if]{.mark} virtually [any of
the **overlapping** and]{.mark} **mutually [reinforcing
explanations]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the [**current stability** are
correct]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[trends in]{.mark} international
[security]{.mark} may well [prove **difficult to reverse**]{.mark}. None
of the **contributing factors** that are commonly suggested]{.underline}
([**[economic development]{.mark}**, complex [**interdependence**,
**nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**, international
[**institutions**, **democracy**]{.mark}, **[shifting]{.mark} global
[norms]{.mark}** [on war]{.mark}) seem poised to disappear any time
soon]{.underline}.50 The [world [will]{.mark}]{.underline} probably
[**[continue]{.mark} its peaceful ways** for the near
future]{.underline}, at the very least, [no matter what the United
States chooses to do or not do]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis concluded
while [pondering the likely effects of U.S. restraint on decisions made
in foreign capitals]{.underline}, "[[It is **very unlikely**]{.mark}
that [**pulling off** the]{.mark} American [**security blanket** would
lead to]{.mark} thoughts of **[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}."51 The United
States will remain fundamentally safe no matter what it does --- in
other words, despite widespread beliefs in its inherent indispensability
to the contrary.

### AT: Alliances !

#### [No war]{.underline} from [abandonment]{.underline} nor [entanglement]{.underline}

**Fisher 16** Max Fisher, foreign editor at Vox, former reporter and
founding editor of the WorldViews foreign affair blog at The Washington
Post, MA International Relations and Affairs, Johns Hopkins University
School of Advanced International Studies, "The Credibility Trap," Vox,
4-29-2016,
<https://www.vox.com/2016/4/29/11431808/credibility-foreign-policy-war>
/GoGreen!

If [[**reputational credibility** has been]{.underline}]{.mark} so
[[**repeatedly debunked**, **both** in **specific instances** and as a
**theory**]{.underline}]{.mark}, why does it continue to loom so large
in America\'s foreign policy discourse?

Tufts University\'s Michael Beckley hinted at one possible explanation
in a much-discussed article last year in International Security: Could
it have something to do with America\'s uniquely broad network of
alliances?

Beckley\'s article was actually asking a different question ---
**[[whether]{.underline}]{.mark}** those [**[alliances lead]{.mark} the
US [to war]{.mark}**[, by]{.mark} allowing allies to \"entangle\" it in
foreign conflict]{.underline}. (Beckley concludes the answer is no;
other scholars have disputed his findings.)

But, in reviewing [so-called \"**[entanglement]{.mark}
theory**,\"]{.underline} Beckley points out that reputational
credibility, even if it doesn\'t exist in the world, is something that
definitely exists in the minds of foreign leaders
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} foreign policy decision-makers.

\"The alliance comes to be perceived as an end in itself, transcending
the more concrete national security interests for which it was initially
conceived,\" political scientist Jack Levy wrote in a well-known 1981
paper (which Beckley cites). Here\'s the key quote:

[Political decision makers come to **believe that support for one\'s
allies**, regardless of its consequences, is **essential** for their
national prestige, and [that]{.mark} the [**failure to provide support**
would]{.mark} ultimately [result in]{.mark} their diplomatic
[**isolation** in a **hostile**]{.mark} **and threatening
[world]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

So it\'s not that reputation is a real thing that compels states to act
in a certain way, but rather that individual decision-makers are driven
by their own mistaken belief in reputation. As a result, Beckley writes,
\"reputational concerns can drive states into wars over trivial
interests in peripheral places.\"

Some **[scholars]{.underline}**, including Levy, [argue that America\'s
**allies promote the idea of reputation, as a means to convince the
U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**to commit more
resources** to serve their own interests]{.underline}.

Foreign leaders do seem to become awfully preoccupied with American
credibility when they want the US to take military action on their
behalf. When the US failed to bomb Syria in 2013, for example, Syria\'s
enemies in the region --- Arab leaders who are also allied with the US
--- declared that American credibility was at stake.

\"I think I believe in American power more than Obama does,\" Jordan\'s
King Abdullah II said of Obama\'s decision to not bomb Syria.

This comes at a time when the US has grown unusually indulgent of its
allies, as Jeremy Shapiro and Richard Sokolsky argue in a recent
article. This has made American policymakers more likely to heed
allies\' demands and take their claims at face value.

But [Dartmouth\'s Jennifer Lind finds [**evidence** that **allies make
this argument only opportunistically**]{.mark}, and almost always about
conflicts in which they are directly involved. They [might
**speak**]{.mark} **in [the language of reputation theory]{.mark}**[,
but]{.mark} their [**behavior** suggests]{.mark} that [they **do
not**]{.mark} **really [believe]{.mark} in [it]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Reputation **[theory]{.mark}**]{.underline}, after all, [[says]{.mark}
that America\'s **[allies would want the US to intervene as much as
possible]{.mark}**]{.underline} in other conflicts, [when [**in fact**
the **opposite is**]{.mark} **usually [true]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There are many good reasons to host such a gathering. It's smart
politics, fulfills a campaign commitment and counters the perception,
fostered by President Donald Trump, that America is no longer interested
in promoting democracy and human rights. But as a geopolitical
instrument, [**drawing lines between democracies and autocracies** is
not only **certain to disappoint** --- it's also a deeply flawed
organizing principle for America's approach to the world]{.underline}.

China and Russia, which Biden has also singled out for criticism, are
not the main causes of the weakening of democracies around the world.
Most of the backsliding, according to a recent study, has been caused by
erosion within the world's democracies, including the United States and
many of its allies. Indeed, the upcoming summit includes a number of
countries --- India, Brazil, the Philippines and Poland among them ---
marked by growing autocratic movements and infringements on freedom of
expression and a free press. And **[[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark}**
these and [**[other countries to reform]{.mark}** their political,
electoral or judicial institutions [**from the outside** is]{.mark} hard
if not **[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Biden isn't the first and won't be the last American president to make
democracy promotion central to his foreign policy. Woodrow Wilson wanted
to make the world "safe for democracy"; Franklin Roosevelt promulgated
the Atlantic Charter. The Clinton administration was present at the
creation of the Community of Democracies. George W. Bush had his Freedom
Agenda and talked about ridding the world of dictators. All found
democracy promotion a useful tool to advance U.S. values and interests.

Biden seems to genuinely believe that democrats and dictators are in a
do-or-die battle over who will own the 21st century. Though he insists
that he doesn't want a new cold war, some of his overcharged rhetoric
belies this view. In March, Biden announced his intention "to invite an
alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future," including
holding "China accountable to follow the rules" on issues such as
persecution of its Uyghur citizens and its territorial disputes with
Taiwan. Biden has said of China's President Xi Jinping that he "doesn't
have a democratic bone . . . in his body" and that Xi believes
"democracy cannot keep up with" China.

It is simplistic to believe, however, that Chinese and Russian foreign
policies are driven by the ideological impulse to spread autocracy. Both
countries see the United States as their main geopolitical adversary and
seek to undermine American influence and alliances wherever they can;
the Chinese are also bent on outcompeting the United States in
21st-century technologies.

But the Russians don't have an authoritarian model for export, and other
autocratic-minded governments don't need inspiration from Moscow to run
kleptocratic, corrupt, repressive and misgoverned regimes. Putin's
overriding priority is self-preservation and the preservation of his
regime. What evidence is there that he believes these objectives can be
achieved only if the rest of the world looks like Russia?

Likewise, Xi's main priority is maintaining his control and the Chinese
Communist Party's monopoly on power. He is all too happy to claim that
the Chinese government is outperforming America's dysfunctional system.
But it is simply not the case that he thinks these goals require Beijing
to actively spread authoritarianism with Chinese characteristics abroad.
And China's wealth and power, not to mention its social stability,
depend on competing effectively within the interdependent global
economic system, not toppling it.

[[Another **flaw**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Biden administration's
approach [[is the **presumption that all democracies think
alike**]{.mark} based on their shared commitment to democratic
values]{.underline}. If only it were that simple. [Values do shape a
nation's foreign policy, but history, geography, culture, political
ideology and material interests also matter]{.underline}. [It is
[**precisely for these reasons** that]{.mark} America's **[democratic
allies]{.mark}** and partners **[do not see eye to eye]{.mark}** on how
to deal with China or Russia --- and why they shouldn't be forced to
choose sides between the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
the authoritarians]{.underline}.

[There's also the **politically inconvenient** question of whether the

rights, the United States continued to experience erosion in democratic

draw conclusions based on '**[cherry-pick]{.underline}**ing' of specific
studies showing how peaceful democracies are, but on a systematic
overview of studies in this field. Therefore, [this book relies on **my
own database** with **[hundreds of]{.mark} different
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are relevant for each chapter;
the articles had to engage directly with the chapter's main research
question. The next section will provide more detailed information around
the selection criteria. This overview includes both highly cited and
recent articles which were selected in a systematic way.

Based on analyses of statistical studies around this topic of democracy
and war, it will become clear that the overall statistical support for
the democratic peace hypothesis is not strong at all. In the rest of the
chapter, I will spell out four reasons why [democracy does **not cause
peace**]{.underline}, and why [the **empirical [support]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} the popular idea of [democratic [peace]{.mark} is
**quite [weak]{.mark}**]{.underline}: (1) most [studies do [no]{.mark}t
find a **strong [correlation]{.mark}**]{.underline} between democracy
and interstate war [[at]{.mark} the **[dyadic
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [they show that there are
**other---more powerful---explanations** for war and peace, or even that
the impact of democracy is a **spurious one**]{.underline}, (2) [the
**theoretical foundation** of the democratic peace hypothesis is
**weak**, and the causal mechanisms are **unclear**]{.underline}, (3)
[democracies are **not necessarily more peaceful**]{.underline} in
general, [and the [evidence]{.mark} for the democratic peace hypothesis
[at the **monadic level** is inconclusive]{.mark}]{.underline}, and (4)
the process of democratization is dangerous and living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country.

In my view, [it is]{.underline} difficult---if not
**[impossible]{.underline}**---[to support the democratic peace
hypothesis]{.underline} without any reservations. The key caveats should
not be ignored and certainly deserve more attention before we can
confidently argue that democracies are more peaceful than other types of
political systems. Please notice that I can already reveal that the
assumed link between democracy and intrastate war is problematic as
well, but this topic will be at the core of the next chapter (Chapter
4).

Selection of Articles: Democracy and War

The instrumental value of democracy cannot convincingly be found in
democracy's expected bond with peace. I have come to this conclusion on
the basis of an analysis of statistical studies, which will be discussed
in the rest of this chapter. So how did I select the articles for my
database?4

For this chapter and Chapter 4, I selected the articles that focused on
war and democracy. Using the online database Web of Science (formerly
known as Web of Knowledge), [I identified]{.underline} a total of almost
**[[8000 articles]{.underline}]{.mark}** published in the sampled
journals until the end of 2015. I identifed them by entering 'democr\*'
in the basic search field; this asterisk (\*)-based 'wildcard' allows
searching for terms including 'democratic', 'democracy', and
'democratization' (in both British and American spellings)
simultaneously, in the title, abstract and/or the keywords. As a next
step, I excluded articles in which 'democracy' is used as synonym for
state (e.g. analysis of the relationship between immigration policies
and unemployment in European democracies) or a specific political party
or movement (e.g. the 'Democrats' in the USA, or Uganda's People's
Democratic Army) or a specifc country (e.g. the Democratic Republic of
Congo). In addition, I identified them by entering 'war\*' in the basic
search feld. The words democracy (democr\*) and war (war\*) need to be
mentioned in title and/or abstract---and I also checked for equivalents
of 'war' like 'conflict' and 'dispute' and 'no peace'.5

As it is not feasible to analyse thousands of articles, it is necessary
to take a next step in the selection process. I decided to select these
articles, which will be part of the database for the third and fourth
chapter, in three different ways. The first method is to choose the
articles with the most citations. So, for example, in Chapter 3, the
articles which are cited more than a hundred times are included in this
first list. The article by Beck et al. (1998) has been cited more than
951 times, and as a consequence, this article is part of the database.
But also articles with a much lower number of citations (such as
Barbieri 1996, with 179 citations) are included in my analyses.

The second method is simply to include the most recent articles
published in the past five years, so since beginning 2011 until end
2015. The most recent articles can easily be overlooked by applying the
first method of most quoted articles. In my view, however, they still
need to be included as they present the most recent findings and engage
with the recent and innovative debates, which cannot be ignored in this
book. For example, recent studies on democracy and interstate war
(Chapter 3) have paid more attention to the mechanisms (see, e.g.,
Zeigler et al. 2014), and there is a growing attention for the impact of
political institutions in recent studies on democracy and intrastate war
(Chapter 4; see, e.g., Walter 2015). Those recent findings cannot be
ignored in any systematic analysis of statistical studies on this theme.

The third method is the most subjective approach of selecting articles,
as it is based on the 'snowballing method'. So it includes articles
which have not been selected by the first and second methods, but which
have been quoted extensively and regularly by the previously selected
articles. For example, the article by Bethany Lacina (2006) cannot be
selected based on having high citations (the first method) and it cannot
be included based on being a recent publication (the second method), but
it has been mentioned by key studies and hence surfaces via the
snowballing method (a third method). This article is important as it
**[clearly [distinguish]{.mark}]{.underline}**es [the]{.underline}
determinants of [**[conflict severity]{.mark}** from]{.underline} those
for **[conflict onset]{.underline}**, and [those [determinants
seem]{.mark} to be **quite [different]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is
crucial information for Chapter 4.

In this way, my study presents and assesses the findings based on a big
pool of statistical studies in the published literature. Based on this
assessment, I will be able to draw clearer conclusions concerning the
significance of the effects of democracy on interstate war (this
chapter) and intrastate war (the next chapter). The Appendix shows more
detailed information of the selected articles.

The Democratic Peace Hypothesis, Its Roots and Supporters

The democratic peace hypothesis6 states that democracies never or seldom
go to war with one another. Where is this powerful idea of 'democratic
peace' coming from? Before discussing the main findings of the
statistical articles and before describing the four caveats of the
'democratic peace paradigm', we need to know a bit more around the
background and the roots of this idea.

Immanuel Kant's 1795 essay Perpetual Peace has often been mentioned as
the foundation for this hypothesis. Kant believed peace was difficult to
achieve, since 'the natural state is one of war' (Kant 1795: 10). A
state of peace must therefore be established for---in his view---it is
certain that hostilities will be committed and people need to be
protected from each other. In such a world, each may treat his
neighbour, from whom he demands security, as an enemy. In a dictatorship
where 'the subjects are not citizens, a declaration of war is the
easiest thing in the world to decide upon, because war does not require
of the ruler, who is the proprietor and not a member of the state, the
least sacrifice of the pleasures of his table, the chase, his country
houses, his court functions, and the like. He may, therefore, resolve on
war as on a pleasure party for the most trivial reasons, and with
perfect indifference leave the justification which decency requires to
the diplomatic corps who are ever ready to provide it' (Kant 1795: 13).

In contrast, the situation is different in constitutional republics,
according to Kant. He argued that the majority of the people in
republics would never vote to go to war, except for pure self-defence.
Therefore, a world with only republics would be peaceful, since there
would be no aggressors. The republican constitution, which requires the
consent of the citizens to start a war, gives the positive prospect of
perpetual peace.

It is important to note that the ideas of Kant on the one hand and the
modern democratic peace scholars on the other hand are not completely
similar. For example, Kant talked about republics instead of democratic
states as the ideal states to achieve peace. He defined republican
states as states with representative governments, in which the
legislature is separated from the executive. Not
surprisingly---considering the epoch in which he lived---Kant did not
include universal suffrage in his definition, which is now seen as an
essential dimension of democracy, even of the most minimalist types of
democracy (Dahl 1971; see also Chapter 2). Moreover, Kant argued that
republics will be at peace in general, which means that such political
systems are expected to be not only in peace with each other, but also
with other non-republican systems. Nowadays, [**only few scholars**
would support]{.underline} this approach of [a '**monadic democratic
peace**']{.underline}. As will become clear at the end of this chapter,
[there is **[no]{.mark}t much [evidence]{.mark}** for the idea that
[democracies are **more peaceful in general**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the 1960s, most statistical studies have not focused on the
'monadic democratic peace hypothesis' but on testing the 'dyadic
democratic peace hypothesis'. This dyadic hypothesis states that it is
less likely that democracies fight with each other, compared to other
'dyads' or other pairs of different types of political systems. The
sociologist Dean Babst was the first scholar who started to build on
Kant's old idea in the 'dyadic' way, and decided to test it in
statistical studies (Babst 1964, 1972). He concluded that 'no wars have
been fought between independent nations with elective governments
between 1789 and 1941' (Babst 1972: 55). His study was not published in
one of the journals in the field of international relations, but in a
sociological journal and later in Industrial Research. Therefore, it was
not read by international relations scholars, and initially, it did not
get the attention it deserved in the field of international politics.

Babst's work was, for example, not cited by Melvin Small and J. David
Singer (1976), and their fndings seemed to contradict Babst's study.
However, Small and Singer did not compare the rates of war proneness for
democracies and dictatorships, but instead they focused on the question
whether wars involving democratic states have historically been
significantly different in length or in degree of violence compared to
wars involving only dictatorships. For length and degree of violence
during the wars, they did not find a difference between democracies and
dictatorships, so they concluded that types of political systems did not
matter.7 A few years later, Rudolph J. Rummel did cite Babst's work and
replicated Babst's idea in statistical tests, which were described in
the fourth book of his five-volume Understanding Confict and War (1975--
1981). He found clear support for his eleventh (of the 33) propositions
about causes and conditions of conflict, which stated that 'Libertarian
systems mutually preclude violence' (Rummel 1979: 279).

Eventually, those innovative studies from the 1970s helped to evoke the
interest in the democratic peace proposition, and in the expected
peaceful nature of relationships among democratic states. Since the
1980s, the number of quantitative studies has increased considerably,
accumulating into an impressive field of research in international
relations with its own 'empirical law' of democratic peace (Levy 1989:
270; see also Ray 1998).

This democratic peace hypothesis has not only received support from
political scientists, but also from politicians and policy makers.
Particularly since 1993, the idea of a democratic peace has inspired
American foreign policies aimed at the promotion of peace and democracy.
As the 42nd president of the USA (1993--2001), Bill Clinton was the
first politician who explicitly bridged the gap between these findings
in international relations on the one hand, and his foreign policy
strategy on the other hand, at least rhetorically. Anthony Lake, who was
Clinton's National Security Adviser, stated in 1993 that in order to
cope with America's foreign policy challenges, the expansion of
democratic states around the world would be essential because 'it
protects our \[U.S.\] interests and security' (see Henderson 2002: 20).
In his 1994 State of the Union, Clinton declared that 'Ultimately, the
best strategy to ensure our security and to build a durable peace is to
support the advance of democracy elsewhere. Democracies don't attack
each other'.8 Findings from research in the field of international
relations seemed to have a direct impact on policy making, and this move
of the Clinton administration can be seen as 'a textbook case of
arbitrage between the ivory tower and the real world' (Gowa 1999: 109).

Clinton's successor, George W. Bush, went one big step further in his
faith that democratic peace holds. He argued that efforts to turn Iraq
into a democratic country would have positive effects on Iraqi's
neighbours. The authoritarian regimes in the region would fall as domino
stones and follow the Iraqi example. They would start democratizing as
soon as they could, which would then result in achieving a peaceful and
stable the Middle East. The real motives for attacking Iraq may have
been different, but 'regime change' was at the heart of Washington's
rhetoric when the USA started to bomb Baghdad in March 2003. The
rhetoric of the Bush administration focused on toppling Saddam Hussein's
regime, and replacing the entire underlying dictatorial system with a
democracy.

Moreover, George W. Bush used the democratic peace idea to justify the
war in Iraq, declaring, 'The reason why I'm so strong on democracy is
democracies don't go to war with each other...I've got great faith in
democracies to promote peace. And that's why I'm such a strong believer
that the way forward in the Middle East, the broader Middle East, is to
promote democracy'.9 In 2004, the 43rd President of the USA said: 'If
you think you can have peace without democracy -- again - I think you'll
find that - I can only speak for myself, that I will be extremely
doubtful that it will ever happen'.10 In his second inaugural address,
he stated that 'the survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends
on the success of liberty in other lands. The best hope for peace in our
world is the expansion of freedom in all the world'.

Again, these are just words from speeches and can hence be seen as
rhetoric to defend military intervention (cf. Jervis 2003; Kaufmann
2004; Daalder and Lindsay 2005; Owen 2005; Lieberfeld 2005; Schmidt and
Williams 2008). Still, in the end, politicians have rationalized their
political decisions based on one of the most powerful ideas taken from
studies in the field of international relations, clearly showing the
influence of this academic idea in political practice.

Hence, the field of international relations seems to have its own law:
democracies rarely fight with each other. It cannot be denied that the
evidence supporting the democratic peace proposition is quite diverse in
character (see Ray 1998): the evidence has been epistemological (Rummel
1975), philosophical (Doyle 1986), formal (Bueno de Mesquita and Lalman
1992), historical (Weart 1994; Ray 1995; Owen 1994), experimental (Mintz
and Geva 1993), anthropological (Ember et al. 1992; Crawford 1994),
psychological (Kegley and Hermann 1995), economic (Brawley 1993; Weede
1996) and political (Gaubatz 1991). Still, there have been numerous
critical studies (see, i.e., Hayes 2011), and the general picture is
unclear. We do not yet know much about the overall findings from
statistical studies.

So far, it seems as if some quantitative studies---mainly within the
field of international relations---have found strong and robust evidence
which supports the 'democratic peace hypothesis'. Those studies show
that democracy has had a positive influence on international peace (see,
i.e., Rummel 1979; Ray and Russett 1996). In this sense, the idea of a
democratic peace seems to be confirmed. Political scientists such as
James Lee Ray are passionate supporters: 'No scientific evidence is
entirely definitive' but 'based on all the empirical evidence so far'
the more defensible of the two possible definitive answers to the
question "Does democracy cause peace?" is "Yes" (Ray 1998: 43). However,
based on my own analyses of the empirical studies with statistical
evidence, I cannot be as enthusiastic as those scholars; to the
contrary, I whole-heartily disagree with them, as a more systematic
analysis of the articles shows that there are four important weaknesses,
which seriously undermines the idea that peace is one of democracy's
instrumental values.

Caveat 1: It's Not (Just) Democracy

While analysing the selected articles, the first remarkable finding is
that only a relatively small number of studies have actually tested the
democratic peace hypothesis. Most of the studies have focused on the
mechanisms (see next section, caveat 2), and hence seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war. In this way, the
majority of the studies---often unintentionally---reinforce the idea
that democratic peace actually exists without testing this proposition.
However, **[no]{.underline}**ne of the [**studies** that **directly
test** the democratic peace]{.underline} hypothesis [found **strong
evidence** that democracy is the **most important factor** when
explaining interstate war]{.underline}. All democratic peace studies
have controlled for many possible alternative causes of the peace, such
as [economic development and growth, geographic distance and contiguity,
power status, alliance ties, militarization and political
stability]{.underline}. The findings show that it is not just democracy
which explains war, not at all. Within this group of studies, which
explicitly test the democratic peace hypothesis, four different types of
findings can be detected. I will discuss those results more in-depth in
the rest of this section.

First Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are
Significant Too

The first subgroup consists of scholars who stress the importance of
democratic peace, despite the fact their own analyses have shown that
other factors are statistically significant as well (Maoz and Russett
1993; Rousseau et al. 1996; Gleditsch and Hegre 1997; Beck et al. 1998;
Ray 2013). For example, some studies (e.g. Rousseau et al. 1996)
included alternative independent variables in order to test realist
arguments. They tested whether the distribution of power determines
decisions to use force, and measures each state's military capabilities
relative to its opponent. A state's military capability is the average
of three elements: number of troops, military expenditures and military
expenditures per soldier. They found that this realist variable was
strong, positive and statistically significant at the 0.001 level in
their analyses (see, e.g., Rousseau et al. 1996: 522, Table 2). However,
not only a state's military capabilities appeared to be an important
explanation for peace. In addition, wealth, growth, alliances and
contiguity played a crucial role when explaining interstate war (see,
e.g., Maoz and Russett 1993: 632, Table 1).11 Moreover, [[when]{.mark}
**other [factors]{.mark}** are [included]{.mark}, the **impact of
[democracy]{.mark}** on the likelihood of international crises
[is]{.mark} **even [spurious]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Maoz and Russett
1993: 632; Henderson 2002: 141, see also p. 3).12 Still, scholars in
this group keep defending the democratic peace idea, despite the fact
that their own analyses showed the significance of alternative
explanations.

Second Result: Initially There Is Correlation, but the Impact of
Democracy Is Spurious When Other Explanatory Factors Are Included in the
Models

The second subgroup of scholars is far more radical. Based on their own
analyses, this group concludes that the democratic peace link is a
spurious one (Weede 1984, 1996; Barbieri 1996; Mousseau 2013; Gartzke
and Weisiger 2014).13 Typically, efforts to demonstrate the spuriousness
of the statistical democratic peace pointed to [other
factors]{.underline} that, [when accounted for '**properly'**,
**eliminated**]{.underline} or dramatically reduced [the statistical
significance of shared democracy]{.underline}. Hence, the studies in
this second group did not find strong evidence for the democratic peace
hypothesis anymore, once other explanatory factors were included in the
models.14

One of the most convincing alternative explanations of peace between
countries is that [there is **no democratic peace**, but a **capitalist
peace instead**]{.underline}. The settlement in Germany and Japan
succeeded because of the establishment of capitalist peace. Because of
economic support by the Americans, who encouraged free trade and offered
trade opportunities in practice as well, the poorer economies in Europe
and Japan would gain economically, resulting in 'economic growth,
prosperity, and, ultimately, free trade among most of the more
technologically advanced economies' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 232). By
establishing and expanding free trade, the incentives for war would
quickly decrease among trading states, according to this approach. To
prevent new interstate wars after World War II, the capitalist peace was
a far more important factor than the American promotion of democracy and
its political institutions.

The capitalist peace, or capitalist peace theory, also states that
economic development accounts for both democracy and the peace among
democratic nations. Economic development is a key factor to explain
democracy (Lipset 1959; see also Hegre 2003; Weede 2004).15 Moreover,
economic development also plays a role when explaining peace, and the
presence of market-oriented economies in countries have a positive
impact on both democracy in those countries and peace between them
(Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, 2013; see also Hegre 2014).
[[Dem]{.mark}ocratic [peace]{.mark} **only [exists]{.mark}** [when
both]{.mark} democracies [have **high**]{.mark} **levels of economic
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, when economic development is well
above the global median.

In fact, the poorest 21% of the democracies studied, and **[the
[poorest]{.mark}]{.underline}** 4--5% of current [[**democracies**,
are]{.mark} **significantly [more likely]{.mark}** than other kinds of
political systems [to **fight each other**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Mousseau 2005). Moreover, if at least one of the democracies
involved has a very low level of economic development, then democracy
cannot prevent war.16 Still, there is a pacifying effect of [free trade
and economic interdependence]{.underline}, which [is **more important**
than the effect of democracy]{.underline}, because the former affects
peace both directly and indirectly, by producing economic development
and ultimately, democracy (see Weede 2004).17

Capitalist peace is not the only alternative explanation. Shared
interests in general, and political similarities in specific, can also
be seen as an important second alternative explanation for war and peace
between countries (Farber and Gowa 1995, 1997; Gartzke 2007; Gowa 1999;
Henderson 2002). [Democracies are **not peaceful** to each other because
they are **democratic**, but rather because they are
**similar**]{.underline}. So the difference of the scores of both
countries also contributes to the conflict proneness of the dyad. If the
difference in levels of democracy is big, then the chance of conflict is
higher (cf. Oneal and Russett 1997: 281--282).

Many researchers have conflated both the conflict-dampening impact of
joined democracy and the confict-exacerbating impact of political
distance in the variables focusing on political systems, but as Errol A.
Henderson (2002: 32) convincingly argued: 'Fusing these two contrasting
attributes in a single variable makes it difficult to distinguish
between the competing processes'. Therefore, it is better to include an
additional variable of 'political dissimilarity' in the model. Henderson
(2002) was one of the first scholars who included this variable and
measured it by taking the absolute value of the difference between the
two states' scores. His main variables were not only political
similarity, but also geographic distance and economic interdependence,
and he concluded that democratic peace is a statistical artefact which
disappears when those other variables are taken into account. Political
similarity clearly has a pacifying effect18 (see Werner 2000; Henderson
2002; Beck et al. 2004), and it is not democracy per se which is the
decisive factor.19

Hence, the benefits of trade and trade interdependence are essential
explanations, while democracy is spurious or at least subordinate (see
also Rosecrance 1986; Weede 1984, 1996; Hegre 2000, 2014; Jervis 2002;
Souva 2003; Rasler and Thompson 2005: 235; Mousseau 2000, 2002, 2003,
2005). Based on those studies, it is safe to conclude that democracy, on
its own, is an unlikely cause of the democratic peace.

Third Result: There Is Correlation, but Other Explanations Are Much
Stronger

This same point that democracy is just one of the explanations for peace
(and not even a very important one) is also at the core of studies in
the third subgroup. Scholars of this group keep arguing that there is
support for the democratic peace hypothesis, and that the link is not
spurious. In this sense, they are less radical than the second group of
scholars, as they do not completely reject the value of democracy for
peace. On the other hand, their own analyses have clearly shown that
alternative factors---hence other factors than democracy or type of
political system--- are not only statistically significant but also more
important when trying to explain interstate war (Bremer 1992; Gelpi
1997; Oneal and Russett 1999a, b; Reiter and Stam 2002; Peterson 2013;
Caselli et al. 2015).

Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence suggest that [democracy is
**not the most important factor**]{.underline}, while war is more likely
to occur between states that are geographically proximate, approximately
equal in power, major powers, allied, economically advanced and highly
militarized than between those that are not. Bivariate analyses of these
factors in relation to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of
states in the period from 1816 to 1965 have generally supported these
associations. However, [multivariate analyses revealed some
differences]{.underline}. Stuart Bremer (1992), for example, showed that
some factors are far more important than others. [The existence of a
**dangerous, [war]{.mark}-prone dyad** can be **[best explained
by]{.mark}** the **presence of [contiguity]{.mark}**, the **absence of
an [alliance]{.mark}** and the **absence of more advanced
economy**]{.underline}. The absence of democratic polity and other
factors (absence of overwhelming preponderance, and presence of major
power) are less powerful. Overall, these findings suggest that our
research priorities may be seriously distorted and that we should not
focus too much on the perceived positive impact of democracy, but on
other factors (such as alliances and economic factors) instead.

Fourth Result: There Is Correlation, but Only Under Certain Specific
Conditions

The final subgroup of scholars argues that we cannot unconditionally
accept the idea that democratic peace exists in general, so always and
everywhere. Their statistical studies clearly showed that support for
this hypothesis heavily depends on other factors. The chance of
democratic peace depends not just on the specific historical period
(Cold War or not; Gibler and Sarkees 2004; Siverson and Emmons 1991;
Weede 1984), but also the stage of the conflict (beginning, duration or
severity; see Bremer 1993; Bennett and Stam 1996; Reed 2000), and on the
neighbourhood instability (extent of confict in the region; see Gibler
and Braithwaite 2013; Gibler and Miller 2013). Despite the differences
between the studies, there is one common finding in all studies: when
explaining interstate war, we cannot just rely on the impact of
democracy, as it is too much dependent on other factors.

Several scholars found strong evidence for the idea that democratic
peace exists, but only during some specific historical periods. Based on
this evidence, they concluded that democratic peace is simply a
statistical artefact of the Cold War. For example, Henry Farber and
Joanne Gowa (1995) found statistical support for the idea that peace
between democracies is an artefact of the Cold War, when the threat from
the communist states forced democracies to ally with one another (see
also Mearsheimer 1990). Sebastian Rosato (2003) also argued that most of
the significant evidence for democratic peace has been observed after
World War II; and that it has happened within a broad alliance, which
can be identified with NATO and its satellite nations, imposed and
maintained by American dominance.

Since the Second World War, war has become a very costly affair.
Scholars discovered that only a handful of states are 'capable of
engaging in major power warfare. That process of elimination has not yet
extinguished the possibility of major power warfare, but it has lowered
its probability immensely' (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). The chance
to achieve something in a war is low in general, and even lower in a
bipolar world with two big power players risking high nuclear war costs
(Jervis 2002). While war became more costly, trade became less costly;
as a consequence, the war/trade costs increased during the Cold War
(Rosecrance 1986; see also Jervis 2002). In such a world, war and
conflict have become less attractive, while trade and cooperation have
become more appealing (Rasler and Thompson 2005: 219). Hence, more
states decided to adopt trading strategies in order to prevent confict
and war as much as possible. In the end, democracy was part of the
story, but only a very small part with a subordinated role next to the
power dynamics during the Cold War, the costs of warfare and the
benefits of trade.

Some scholars found evidence that the democratic peace still exists in
the post-Cold War period (Park 2013) which weakens this argument.
However, most analyses showed that dyadic dispute rates have converged
after the Cold War (see, e.g., Gowa 2011). Moreover, jointly democratic
dyads are likely to be allied only after 1945 (see Gibler and Sarkees
2004); during the 1816--1944 time period, there is even a negative
relationship between democratic dyads and alliance formation.20 These
findings cast serious doubts on the idea of a general existence of
democratic peace.

Not only the historical period, but also [the ***stage*** of the
conflict is crucial]{.underline}. Some scholars in this group provided
evidence that [democratic peace is **not universal**]{.underline}, but
that it depends on the stage and whether we focus on the beginning,
duration or severity of the conflict. Although joint democracy has some
pacifying effects on the onset of conflict, the results suggest that
they are unrelated to the escalation of disputes to war (see Reed 2000).
Moreover, democratic peace is dependent on the neighbourhood
instability. Democracies often have few territorial issues over which to
contend, as they tend to be part of a stable region. Democracies only
seldom have territorial disputes with their neighbours, and therefore
they can more easily choose favourable conflicts to escalate. The type
of political system does not predict conflict selection or victory once
controls are added for issue salience (Gibler and Miller 2013; see also
Park and James 2015). There is an interaction between joint democracy
and regional instability, which confirms the idea that the effects of
type of political system on continued conflict apply mostly to dyads in
peaceful regions (Gibler and Braithwaite 2013; see also Park and James
2015). [**Very democratic countries** might]{.underline} even [become
**more aggressive** and **faster** than other political systems, once
the **region** becomes more hostile]{.underline} (see, e.g., Baliga et
al. 2011).

The General Lesson from the Results in a Nutshell (Caveat 1)

In short, regardless of the differences between the statistical studies
on democratic peace, all findings have indicated that other explanations
are important as well. It is clear that democracy is just one of the
explanations, and certainly not the most important one,21 sometimes even
spurious and often heavily dependent on other factors. It is not (just)
democracy to be preoccupied with, when trying to prevent war between
countries (Table 3.1).

Caveat 2: What Are the Causal Mechanisms?

Most of the statistical studies on democratic peace seem to assume that
there is a correlation between democracy and war; based on this
assumption, they then decide to focus on the mechanisms. This is
problematic as none of the democratic peace studies found strong
evidence that democracy is the most important factor when explaining
interstate war (see the previous section). As a consequence, the next
step of looking for mechanisms is quite irrelevant and not necessary in
my view, but most studies nevertheless argue that the field lacks strong
theoretical foundations and robust empirical evidence that can reveal
convincing causal mechanisms.22 Those studies seem to accept the
correlation between dyadic democracy and peace, and then start
questioning whether democracy really causes peace before investigating
potential mechanisms.

VI\. THE INTERLOCKING CRISES

In this Part, we highlight how the vulnerabilities of democracy are made
salient as well as exacerbated by climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene. We also emphasize how [**climate change** and **other
problems** of the Anthropocene place **democracies** that attempt to
navigate them in a **particularly impervious Scylla and Charybdis**-like
situation]{.underline}.173 [The Scylla is **ineffective policy**; the
Charybdis is some **relaxation of** the core democratic principle of
**popular sovereignty**. Both options seem nearly **guaranteed** to
trigger **significant legitimacy challenges** to **liberal democratic
systems**]{.underline}.

Traditionally, two important sources of democratic legitimacy have been
beneficial consequences, in the utilitarian tradition, and consent, in
the social contract tradition.174 Whatever else may count as beneficial
consequences, the capacity to solve problems that threaten the physical
and social security of citizens is a central and important source of
democratic legitimacy.175 Call this the "public utility" view of
democratic legitimacy. And whatever else may count as consent, surely
the fact that the majority of citizens have expressed their preference
for a certain candidate, law, or policy is an important source of
democratic legitimacy as well.176 Call this the "expressed preference"
view of democratic legitimacy.

Consider public utility first. As we have pointed out, most
[contemporary **democracies** have]{.underline} thus far [**failed** to
address]{.underline} the **[emerging problems]{.underline}** of the
Anthropocene.177 Consequently, the sense of physical and social
insecurity grows more acute amongst citizens as the problems mount and
compound.178 The legitimacy of these democracies, and the supranational
institutions they have created, such as the European Union and the
United Nations, is thus compromised on public utility grounds.

Now consider expressed preference. [[The **global scope**]{.mark},
long-term reach, unprecedented features, [and **highly complex** nature
of **climate change** and **other problems**]{.mark} of the Anthropocene
[require]{.mark} democracies to make robust commitments to
**[multilateral coop]{.mark}eration**, **[long-term planning]{.mark}**,
significant deviations from the status quo, [and]{.mark} increased
reliance on **[expert knowledge]{.mark}** if they are to succeed in
managing these problems]{.underline}. 179 Citizens' expressed
preferences may be quite distant from this network of commitments and
activities,180 since the benefits of successfully managing a problem
like climate change would mostly accrue not to these citizens, but to
spatiotemporally distant people (i.e., the global poor and future
generations) and genetically distant (non-human) nature. 181 Attempting
to force such commitments, especially at a time when democracies are
already being accused of not being responsive enough to their citizens,
can further compromise legitimacy.182

[We thus face an apparent dilemma: **[if democracies fail]{.mark}** to
successfully address climate change and other problems of the
Anthropocene, [their **legitimacy will be challenged** on **public
utility**]{.mark} grounds. **[If they aggressively]{.mark} attempt to
[address them]{.mark}**[, their **legitimacy will**]{.mark} **likely [be
challenged]{.mark}** [on **expressed preference**]{.mark} grounds.
**[Either way]{.mark}**, we can [**expect** the **power** of
**populist**]{.mark} figures and **[movements to
grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The remainder of this Part illuminates this dilemma by discussing how
[climate change and other problems]{.underline} of the Anthropocene
[interact [with]{.mark}]{.underline} some further **[[democratic
vulnerabilities:]{.underline}]{.mark}** weak multilateralism,
short-termism, the profusion of veto players, the contested role of
experts, and self-referring decision making.

A. **[[Weak Multilateralism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Climate change cannot be successfully managed without a strong
commitment to international cooperation.183 For a climate regime to
succeed, it must be effective, perceived as at least not unfair by all
parties, and otherwise acceptable to each party.184 At various times,
the attempt to create a regime has foundered on each of these three
considerations.185

From the beginning of the negotiations that led to the adoption of the
FCCC in 1992 and in subsequent negotiations under the Convention, the
question of fairness has been unavoidable.186 When agreements have been
structured in ways that are acceptable to developing countries (e.g.,
the Kyoto Protocol) they have been perceived as unfair by the United
States.187 This has led to the weakening of commitments and to a regime
whose effectiveness is in question.188 The Paris Agreement, by putting
voluntary pledges at the center, was designed to avoid the problem of
perceived unfairness.189 It was reasonably thought that no party could
say that they had been unfairly treated when they have agreed to be
measured in relation to a commitment that they have voluntarily
undertaken and to which no sanctions are attached for non-compliance.
190 Nevertheless, that was exactly the claim made by President Trump in
announcing his intention to withdraw the United States from the Paris
Agreement.191 Moreover, the cost of creating an agreement to which no
one could reasonably object was to create an Agreement whose
effectiveness was in question even before the United States announced
its intention to withdraw.192

While climate change is its own "full tragedy and weird comedy," 193
there are structural issues at work.194 As the world order attempts to
adjust to shifting power distributions following the emergence of new
giants such as China and India, when it comes to problems such as
climate change the cooperation of such countries is no longer just
desirable but essential.195 As their collaboration becomes more
valuable, the price for obtaining it rises accordingly.196 This
complicates negotiations, and the problem seems only destined to worsen
because this logic applies not only to presently emerging world powers,
but also to those that have already emerged and those that will emerge
in the future. As we observed in an earlier paper, "\[g\]lobal
governance in the Anthropocene is cooperation-hungry, and this increases
the price of obtaining cooperation from every country."197

In addition, [**democracies** have their own **particular problems**
when it comes to **multilateral agreements**. Except in the rare case
where they are able to steer multilateral agreements in the way they
prefer, democratic governments "[often **seek to avoid
compliance**]{.mark} with binding **multilateral decisions** if [this
**weakens their relationship to their
electorate**]{.mark}]{.underline}."198 [This is in fact what happened in
the case of]{.underline} President [Trump's repudiation of the Paris
Agreement]{.underline}.199 The stated reason was the agreement's
unfairness to the United States.200 However, the deeper reason was that
the Obama administration's decision to join, although admittedly an act
of national self-determination, was not in fact an authentic deliverance
of American popular sovereignty, at least in the eyes of Trump and his
supporters.201 According to Trump,

> \[t\]he Paris Climate Accord is simply the latest example of
> Washington entering into an agreement that disadvantages the United
> States to the exclusive benefit of other countries, leaving American
> workers -- who \[sic\] I love -- and taxpayers to absorb the cost in
> terms of lost jobs, lower wages, shuttered factories, and vastly
> diminished economic production.202

In the same speech Trump reminded his audience that "I was elected to
represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris."203

In democracies, it is ultimately citizens who empower their
representatives to bargain and strike terms of international
cooperation.204 Successfully addressing the problems of the Anthropocene
is likely to require unprecedented levels of multilateralism.205
Democratic states that attempt to rise to the challenge are likely to
face legitimacy challenges on expressed preference grounds. Those that
do not may face legitimacy challenges on public utility grounds.

B. **[[Short-termism]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Short-termism can be defined as "the priority given to present net
benefits at the cost of future ones."206 Short-termism is a problem
whenever policy domains have an extended timeframe, as is the case with
climate change and other systemic problems of the Anthropocene.207 In
these cases, present net benefits may need to be curtailed (through
increases in taxes and regulations, for example) for the sake of
benefits that might materialize in the distant future. These future
benefits will then mostly advantage people other than those who have
borne the costs. Reasons for privileging the present in these cases
include pure time preference, uncertainty, and diminished or even null
moral concern for those who might benefit in the future.208 The
temptation, then, is to eschew the costs of the required policies and
"pass the buck" to future generations.209

Short-termism is not always irrational nor morally wrong.210 It has been
argued, however, that short-termism is both irrational and morally wrong
in the case of climate change.211 The sources of short-termism are
rooted in human psychology and can manifest in any kind of political
regime.212 However, it has been argued that democracies are particularly
vulnerable to short-termism.213

[One important reason for the short-termism of democratic political
regimes is that these regimes inherit, via voting and other forms of
popular influence, their citizens' biases in favor of the present.
**[Policies]{.mark}** may also]{.underline} reflect [citizens'
**[misinformation]{.mark}** about, or unawareness of, long-term
processes, risks, policy aims, and possible outcomes]{.underline}.214
[[To counter]{.mark} these tendencies, liberal democracies [typically
filter]{.mark} their citizens' inter-temporal biases, misinformation,
and unawareness [through]{.mark} such mechanisms as constitutions and
reliance on **[expert bodies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.215 [[Yet the **more
filtering**]{.mark} they do, [the **more likely**]{.mark} they
[are]{.mark} to incur **[legitimacy challenges]{.mark}** on expressed
preference grounds]{.underline}.216 This is a problem of
intra-generational legitimacy.217

There are also problems of inter-generational legitimacy.218 There is no
guarantee that long-term policies, if enacted, will achieve the
anticipated aims, or that they will indeed make future people better off
by achieving these aims.219 If things do not work out, these policies
might be deemed illegitimate on public utility grounds by the very
future people that they were supposed to benefit.220 In addition, such
policies may be deemed illegitimate by future people on expressed
preference grounds.221 Legitimacy on expressed preference grounds
typically requires some form of authorization by those who are affected
by policies, yet future people who will be affected by past policies
never authorize them, nor can they hold anyone accountable.222

[Another reason for democracies' short-termism is the scheduling of
participatory events]{.underline}.223 Democracy requires elections,
which must be relatively frequent in order to ensure that people can
regularly express their will, vote out politicians who are judged to
have failed in some important ways, and prevent rent-seeking behavior by
not giving politicians enough time to set up camp within
institutions.224 However, [the relatively **short duration of electoral
cycles** ensures that politicians are constantly concerned with their
own reelection, and this may prevent them from taking hard policy
decisions that require a great deal of political capital and do not
produce appreciable outcomes in time for the next
election]{.underline}.225 [Because most of the **[impacts]{.mark}** of
climate change will largely **materialize in the future** and be felt by
future generations, efforts at their alleviation must obey a clock that
is **[not in sync with the electoral clock]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Note that there is no need to assume that politicians are always and
necessarily motivated by only a thirst for power.226 In a democ- racy,
even politicians who are exclusively motivated by the aspiration to make
good long-term policy need to be elected or re-elected to do so.227 In
order to be elected, they need to harness the votes of the current
electorate.228 So, the problem of short-termism goes beyond a lack of
conscientious far-sightedness on the side of politicians: it is
structurally connected to the very fact of popular sovereignty---at
least as long as the majority of people discount the future.229

C. **[[Veto Players]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Any political system (with the possible exclusion of some forms of
anarchy) accords veto powers to some agent: a monarchy to the king, an
aristocracy to the nobility, a technocracy to the experts, a theocracy
to the religious leader, and so on.230 A veto player in a political
system can be understood as an agent who can prevent a departure from
the status quo.231 In democracies, veto players can be specified by
constitutions (e.g., the President and the Congress in the United
States), emerge from the political system (e.g., the Supreme Court in
the United States, political parties that are members of a government
coalition in Western Europe), or from civil society (e.g., powerful
industries, unions or other interest groups in many countries).232

In a democracy, veto players can protect minority interests, prevent
destabilizing change, and preserve important values and policies through
periods in which they are unpopular.233 More generally, veto players
prevent a democratic system from being excessively fluid and
flexible.234 This is attractive when the status quo is desirable or an
exogenous shock is beneficial; however, when the status quo is
undesirable or an exogenous shock disturbs a desirable status quo,
fluidity and flexibility are needed in order to respond quickly

and decisively.235 This is arguably the situation in the case of climate

change, which demands nimble political responses to which veto

players would have to acquiesce.

[The presence of many veto players threatens to delay or even block the
formulation and implementation of policy]{.underline}.236 Liberal
democracies, with their reliance on checks and balances generated by
institutional architecture or by competition among interest groups, seem
particularly vulnerable to such threats---and the more veto players in a
democracy the greater the degree of vulnerability.237

[An **especially high concentration of veto players** helps to explain
why a powerful, rich, technological leader like the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is **uncannily slow** to address consequential
public issues such as the politics of distribution, racial equality,
immigration, the proper balance between liberty and national security,
and of course climate change]{.underline}.238 The United States
Constitution separates powers in the federal government, reserves a
broad range of powers to states and includes a bill of rights that can
be viewed as effectively giving veto powers to individuals in some
circumstances. Practices have also developed through time that inhibit
action, such as requiring supermajorities for some political decisions.

[The profusion of **veto players** may be extreme in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [but it [is]{.mark} a feature
[common to]{.mark} many **[liberal democracies]{.mark}** that often
[makes]{.mark} political [action **elusive**]{.mark} even on relatively
minor policy issues]{.underline}.239 For every possible policy change,
there is always a "do-nothing" alternative (sometimes more respectably
presented as a "wait and see" alternative) that is invariably attractive
to some veto player.240

"Do-nothing" alternatives may sometimes be justified on grounds of
rational choice considerations relating to transition costs and
uncertainty about both the process of transition and the final pay-off
structure.241 Veto players give voice to such considerations, as well as
other considerations that we have already noted.242 But veto players may
also give voice to less rational tendencies, which are inevitably
present and, in democracies, are crystallized in votes. Among these
tendencies may be disproportionate attention to sunk costs, finding
refuge in "what has always worked," fear of regretting the changes made,
the desire to maintain and transmit a sense of control by not acceding
to the demands of new circumstances, and lack of trust in those who are
proposing the changes.243

Veto players tend to slow down or block deviations from the status quo,
and this makes it difficult to tackle climate change and other similar
problems of the Anthropocene.244 But veto players also reflect and
configure real structures of power, and protect and promote the needs
and interests of actual people.245 When the number of veto players or
the importance of specific veto players is altered, new power structures
emerge and this can raise legitimacy challenges on both utility and
expressed preference grounds.246 It is not obvious what veto players
should be eliminated or demoted in order to produce more nimble and
effective climate policy, and which ones should be given additional
power instead. Nor is it obvious who should decide the answers to these
questions (if not the people) and on what grounds (if not majority
rule).

Veto players configure systems of checks and balances, filters and
buffers, which are only partially exposed to popular influence.247 This
anti-majoritarian service is particularly precious to liberal
democracies, which rely on veto players to protect and promote the
rights of individuals and minorities---and, with that, the core liberal
principles of individual liberty and human rights. However, as a
consequence, if a majority exists that is overwhelmingly convinced by
climate science, totally in favor of leaving all remaining fossil energy
sources in the ground, and ready to embark on ambitious renewable energy
programs, this majority may still find it difficult to act. Liberal
democracies protect minorities of various kinds in varying degrees, and
these include climate change denialists and those who profit from fossil
fuels. Economically powerful and en- trenched economic minorities (the
"1%") are often extremely effective veto players.248 This can prevent
action that would benefit most people, thus increasing the risks of
legitimacy challenges.

D. **[Contested Role of Experts]{.underline}**

Climate change and other problems of the Anthropocene are unprecedented
phenomena whose complexity and implications are only beginning to be
understood by scientists and other experts. Climate change is a
multidimensional problem that concerns and connects ecology, demography,
development, production, consumption, resource use, trade rules, health,
security, urban planning, mobility, migration, and more, in novel
ways.249 It poses threats that are multi-scalar, probabilistic,
indirect, often invisible, spatiotemporally unbound, and potentially
catastrophic. These threats challenge our reason, emotions, and
imagination.250 If there were ever a complex problem that required
expert knowledge, it is climate change.

Liberal democracies make significant use of expert knowledge in
policymaking in various ways to protect liberal values, and to boost
their efficiency, equity, and political stability.251 Expert knowledge
is distinguished from non-expert opinion through such criteria as
experience, professional and educational qualifications, peer-review,
and rules of evidence.252

Still, in a democracy, differences in expertise do not translate to
differences in political authority, for much the same reason why
differences in lineage do not translate in this way. A democratic
citizen can recognize expertise and accept the science of, say, climate
change, and still object to the expert who counsels some course of
action: "You may be right, but who made you boss?"253 In a democracy,
expertise is always subservient to the voice of the people (pace Plato,
philosophers cannot be kings).254

For this reason, the relationships between experts and ordinary citizens
are always potentially fraught in a democracy. These relationships vary
from country to country, time to time, and issue to issue. Often, the
relationships are placid in good times and rocky in hard times. Major
policy failures, such as the global financial crisis of 2008 and the
spreading of terrorist radicalization in many European Union countries,
can lead citizens to question experts' knowledge and see them as just
another interest group seeking rents at people's expense.255

In the case of climate change, an additional element makes the role of
experts potentially unpopular. Climate science, in our present social
context, inevitably provokes fundamental questions about how we ought to
live and organize our societies, throwing doubt on the ways in which we
do so now. A particularly powerful and widespread attempt to avoid
cognitive dissonance through various forms of rationalization may thus
come into play. After all, if something potentially catastrophic such as
climate change can result from the very ways in which we live our
everyday lives---how we dwell, how we eat, how we make things, how we
move around---the nagging thought is that there might be something
fundamentally wrong about the ways in which we live. These are not
comfortable thoughts and can lead to resentment or worse towards those
who bear the message.

The incipient conflict and simmering resentment has been exploited by
powerful interests who look to be the immediate losers from a transition
to a more sustainable way of life. They stoke the dissonance and
encourage denialism. The most obvious manifestation of this is the
climate change denial campaign, directed towards preventing the
formation of a consensus for political action on climate change.256

The main strategy of climate change denialists has been to suppress both
belief in the science and belief that there is a scientific consensus on
the existence, anthropogenic nature, and dangerousness of climate
change.257 In its aims and strategies, climate change denialism has
replicated earlier forms of denialism involving tobacco smoking, acid
rain, DDT, and ozone depletion. 258

The rhetorical techniques adopted by climate change denialism have also
not been particularly original: versions of these techniques were used
in all the other cases mentioned above. These techniques include
attacking sources rather than discussing evidence, "moving the goalpost"
by requesting ever larger amounts of evidence, submitting false
evidence, suggesting false equivalences or analogies, confusing
ignorance about mechanisms or processes with ignorance about facts or
outcomes, cherry-picking anomalies, selective skepticism, quote mining,
and the so-called "Gish gallop"---overwhelming discussants or audiences
with unscientific claims to make it difficult to counter all the
misinformation at once.259

What is new about denialism in the Anthropocene is not its strategies or
tactics, but its amplification. Expertise denialism now travels through
social media, which allows for unfiltered instant communication among
citizens and between citizens and representatives. Traditional
intermediaries---political parties, intellectuals, and the professional
press---are increasingly made redundant by these technologies. Indeed,
to maintain their relevance (and market share), these traditional
intermediaries often seek to replicate the immediacy and excitement of
social media, compromising their own claims to epistemological or
institutional privilege.

One effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is an increased tendency to
brand political ideas and policy proposals and to market them as
products.260 The need to engage audiences with arguments and relevant
facts---and even to maintain consistency in one's opinions--- decreases,
while the need for a good, resonant, quick-win pitch increases. With
that, the importance of expert knowledge is downplayed to the advantage
of skilled branding and marketing.

Another effect of the speed and directness with which political
communication occurs through social media is a polarizing fragmentation,
not just at the level of policy judgments, but also regarding the sets
of facts to which different individuals and groups make reference.
Social media allows for networked, yet highly fragmented, political
communication, making it harder to individuate and even debate a common
story.261

Much empirical work in psychology, economics, political science,
sociology, and communications has gone into trying to explain how and
why disagreement about facts can occur.262 The explanation seems to be
some sort of "biased assimilation," whereby people adjust their view of
facts with reference to their self-defining values, social identities,
and partisan allegiances.263 Experiments on reception suggest that
individuals selectively credit or dismiss information in a manner that
reinforces beliefs congenial to their values.264 These experiments found
that subjects were substantially more likely to count a scientist as an
authoritative "expert" when the scientist was depicted as taking a
position consistent with the subjects' cultural predispositions, than
when that scientist took a contrary position.265 Interestingly, these
tendencies seem to be directly, rather than inversely, related to levels
of science literacy and general education of experimental subjects: the
more equipped people are to know and understand the facts, the more they
disagree on them.266

In times of social media, these tendencies may be amplified, insofar as
individuals tend to gravitate towards and engage mostly with resonant
networks of "like-me's" that by and large reaffirm their own values and
perspectives.267 This may tribalize positions and impede constructive
democratic engagement and debate from ever taking off on many contested
issues. In addition, one can expect increasing polarization to also be
fomented by individuals and groups trying to secure loyalty to their
branded political ideas and policy proposals in this way.

The internet and other media, with their seemingly endless resources,
create the impression that expertise can be picked and chosen at will,
thereby feeding the perception of public life as a spectacle.268 Public
discussions, unfiltered by "moderators," unfold in a denuded space
stripped of epistemological norms.269 In the United States at least,
this has morphed into a generalized atmosphere of expertise denialism
writ large. Denialism about evolution, vaccines, economics, and more has
become commonplace.270

It is not an exaggeration to say that we are on the verge of adopting
epistemological nihilism as a public epistemology.271 No commitment to
facts, in the traditional sense, or even consistency of opinion, is
required.272 Truth is what the speaker says it is, here and now. In a
moment it may be different, depending on what the speaker can get away
with. In a democracy, it is up to elections or approval ratings to
resolve disagreements. It is a short step from here to other exercises
of power.

The nihilistic turn in public epistemology threatens the legitimacy of
democracy, for democracy cannot solve the problems it faces without
mobilizing epistemological authority that is itself hostage to popular
vote. As difficult as this challenge may be in favorable times, it is
greatly magnified in the face of climate change and other problems of
the Anthropocene.

E. Self-referring Decision-making

What we have elsewhere called the "agency presupposition" is deeply
entrenched in modern democratic theory. This presupposition holds "that
the political community is constituted by agents who initiate and
conduct political action, and who themselves, and their interests and
welfare, are what matter politically."273 The agency presupposition
arose at a time in which democratic principles, norms and institutions
were being developed to govern relations between agents who lived in
close proximity to one another in space and time, and whose decisions
and actions had relatively direct impacts on each other. However, around
1950, a profound change occurred from a world of discrete but
interdependent states to a world of shared social space in which distant
events have localized impacts and vice-versa. In this globalized world,
the fates of nation-states and their peoples became not just effectively
interdependent, but also structurally interconnected, with social,
political, and economic activities, interactions, and infrastructures
stretching beyond political frontiers, leading to a deepening enmeshment
of the local and the global.274 Political decisions and actions taken
locally (in selected powerful countries, many of which were democratic)
now systematically had planetary implications, impacting for better or
worse the welfare and interests of people in all corners of the world.

With the Anthropocene disruption of earth's fundamental ecological
systems, including those that govern climate, political agents (living
humans who can initiate and conduct political action) have gained
unprecedented power over a vast universe of non-agents that comprises
animate and inanimate nature as well as those living on the periphery of
both space and time.275 The circle of affected nonagents has expanded
beyond cultural, genetic, and spatiotemporal boundaries to include
virtually everything on the planet, now extended indefinitely in
time.276 This establishes an enormous asymmetry of power. Those on the
periphery, and nature, cannot initiate and conduct political action:
they cannot reciprocate, they cannot participate, they cannot protest,
they cannot retaliate.277 In democratic terms, they do not matter---or
only matter derivatively, if political agents care about their fate. And
it is as undemocratic as can be, particularly if the democracy in
question is a liberal democracy, to force political agents to care if
they do not.278

A phenomenon like climate change creates ubiquitous tensions and
trade-offs between agents and non-agents---those who are governed, and
those who are affected.279 The latter will suffer most from climate
change, but a democracy responsive to the claims of future generations
(or those living beyond its borders, or nonhuman nature) may often have
to forgo opportunities for bringing beneficial consequences to those who
empower it with their votes.280 Instead, democratic leaders would have
to enact policies favoring the interests of those who do not vote
because they do not yet exist (or live in different countries or are not
human).

Democracies making policies that favor non-agents will expose themselves
to intra-generational legitimacy challenges on both public utility
grounds and expressed preference grounds.281 Even if the expected
benefits to non-agents were great, such non-agent-oriented policies
might not win the hearts, minds, and guts of living human agents who may
express their preference for themselves instead--- particularly in
democracies that are already being accused of not being responsive
enough to their citizens.282 Many believe that ignoring or heavily
discounting the welfare and interests of non-agents is morally wrong,
but if expressed preference is important, it may be a wrong that
democracies cannot avoid committing.283

The agency presupposition makes government responsive to those who are
governed but not to those who are affected beyond borders in space,
time, citizenship, or genetic make-up. A basic presupposition of liberal
democracy appears to be threatened by the very actions that would have
to be taken to express concern for all those affected by the
climate-changing and eco-altering actions of its citizens.

VII\. CONCLUSION

We began this Article by explaining the notion of the Anthropocene and
briefly telling the story of failed responses to climate change. We went
on to discuss the uneasy relationship between climate change and
democracy, focusing on liberal democracy in particular. We presented
some basic aspects of democratic theory and practice, and discussed some
of democracy's main vulnerabilities. We showed how in the Anthropocene
these vulnerabilities can magnify, leading to legitimacy challenges.

[These legitimacy challenges are not new. Democracy has always been
haunted by anxiety about its future]{.underline}. Some political
theorists have argued that [**[democracy]{.mark}** is the only form of
political organization that **[underwrites]{.mark}** the seeds of **[its
own destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}.284 [Demagogues and extremists
who wish to blow up the state are allowed the same freedoms as those who
seek to manage it more fairly and effectively]{.underline}. [The risk of
a [**democratically enabled democide** is **not**]{.mark} an
[**abstract** or **counterfactual**]{.mark} risk: the executioners of
German democracy came to power through the rules and procedures of the
**Weimar Republic**]{.underline}.285 If we open our eyes, we may see
these stories going on around us today.

Modern democracy is, in many respects, the most sophisticated
articulation of the human capacity for social organization. It is also
the most hospitable environment for the expression of human values that,
through centuries of emancipatory struggles, have come to be regarded as
fundamental, such as individual liberty and political equality.286 Our
objective in this Article is not to write a requiem for democracy, but
rather to chart the seas that democratic theory and practice will have
to navigate in order to successfully address climate change and survive
the challenges of the Anthropocene. We have highlighted the
vulnerabilities of democracy in order to throw in sharp relief the many
challenges entailed by the voyage, not to discourage it. Democracy has
shown itself to be remarkably resilient in the past, and it may well
succeed in rising to these challenges as well. There are those who think
that democracy doesn't stand a chance.287 But many still believe that
the only solution to the problems of the Anthropocene lies in more,
better, or different democracy.288 And there are those who think that
even if democracy fails these challenges, democracy itself will not have
failed. For they see its value as intrinsic, and not just as a means to
better or more effective governance.289

It is difficult to sketch the nature of possible democratic solutions to
some of the issues that we have raised, and we will not try to do so
here. Instead, we will close with a summary of what seems to be the main
challenge ahead. The existing democratic deficits in liberal countries
will generally have to be reduced. Yet, in the case of climate change
and other problems of the Anthropocene, liberal democratic countries
will have to muster both the internal coherence and strength to better
resist populism, and the external coherence and strength to be more
cooperative partners within the framework of supranational institutions.
This is necessary because, in the Anthropocene, the global spills into
the domestic and vice-versa: a globally changing climate may have
pernicious local impacts on the territory and population of any given
country, while [[**political dysfunction in one country**
can]{.underline}]{.mark} cripple **[[\[halt\] efforts at global
governance]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The democracies of the Anthropocene will have to work at multiple scales
in both space and time, incorporating the interests of the global with
those of the local, and those of the future with those of the present.
This seems to suggest, perhaps paradoxically, that the democracies of
the Anthropocene will have to be more democratic in some respects and
less democratic in others. The relation between popular sovereignty and
institutions that limit popular sovereignty while respecting it is a
tug-of-war in democratic theory and practice that has been going on for
millennia, and is now being put to unprecedented tests.

Liberal democracies, in particular, have an enormous amount at stake.
Liberal political theory has always recognized the right to resist and
even overthrow illegitimate political power.290 This right has been used
to justify historical events that liberals typically applaud, including
the Glorious Revolution, the French Revolution, and the American
Revolution.291 Despite their failures and excesses, these revolutions
forwarded liberal values and helped to entrench them in institutions.
Unable to find consistent responses to challenges to their own
legitimacy in the Anthropocene, liberal democracies may be in danger of
warranting revolutions against themselves and the very institutions that
should realize their values. They may become the ancient regime.

the Risks," Terrorism and Political Violence, vol. 33, no. 1,

[The likelihood that anyone **outside a war zone**]{.underline} [will be
killed by an]{.underline} Islamist [extremist terrorist is **extremely
small**. In the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, for example, [some]{.underline} **[six
people]{.underline}** [have perished each year since 9/11 at the hands
of such [terrorists]{.mark}---for an annual fatality rate of about **one
in 50 million**]{.underline} for the period.

This might be taken to suggest, as one writer has characterized it, that
"terrorism is such a minor threat to American life and limb that
[[it's]{.mark} simply **bizarre**---just **[stupefyingly irrational and
intellectually unserious]{.mark}**---to suppose that it could even
**begin** to justify]{.underline} the abolition of privacy rights as
they have been traditionally understood in favour of the installation of
a panoptic [surveillance]{.underline} state." 1 And [terrorism
**specialist**]{.underline} Marc Sageman [characterizes [the
threat]{.mark}]{.underline} terrorists present in the United States
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} "rather
**[[negligible]{.underline}]{.mark}**." 2 The vast majority of what is
commonly tallied as [terrorism]{.underline} has occurred **[in war
zones]{.underline}**, and this is especially true for fatalities.3 But
**[even]{.underline}** this [[has been
**exaggerated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [by [conflating
**terror**]{.mark}ism [with **war**]{.mark}]{.underline}: civil war
violence that would previously have been seen to be acts of insurgency
are now often labeled terrorism.4

In order to put the numbers in some context, it has often been pointed
out that **[[far more]{.mark} Americans [are killed]{.mark} each
year]{.underline}** [not only by such]{.underline} highly
**[destructive]{.underline}** [hazards as **drug**]{.underline}
overdose**[s]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[automobile]{.underline}** accident**[s]{.underline}**, [but even
by]{.underline} such comparatively **[minor]{.underline}**
[ones]{.underline} as lightning, accident-causing
**[deer]{.underline}**, **[peanut]{.underline}** allergie[**s**, or
**[drowning in bathtubs]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Some comparisons are
arrayed in Table 1.

In recent years, however, critics have attacked what they call "the
bathtub fallacy." 5

First, they stress that it is important to keep in mind that bathtubs
are not out to kill you while terrorism is a willful act carried out by
diabolical, dedicated, and clever human beings. Thus, although the
number of people Islamist terrorists have been able to kill in the West
since 9/11 has thus far been quite limited, those terrorists, as they
plot and plan and learn from experience, may very well become far more
destructive in the future.

Second, the critics charge that the comparison of terrorism with bathtub
drownings is incomplete in that it doesn't consider the possibility that
the incidence of terrorist destruction is low precisely because
counterterrorism measures are so effective.

Third, it is argued that, unlike bathtub drownings, terrorism exacts
costs far beyond those entailed in the event itself. It damagingly sows
terror, fear, and anxiety; disturbs our

![Table Description automatically
generated](media/image7.png){width="4.0625in"
height="3.976396544181977in"}

psychological well-being; undermines trust and openness within the
society; and reduces our sense of intrinsic moral worth even as it
increases a sense of helplessness. They maintain, fourth, that the
comparison is invalid because, unlike terrorism, bathtubs provide
benefit.

And finally, they contend that terrorism costs are peculiarly high,
particularly in a democratic society, because the fears it generates
will necessarily need to be serviced by policy makers, and this pressure
forces, or inspires, them to adopt countermeasures, both foreign and
domestic, that are costly and sometimes even excessive.

In this article, we examine these five propositions and find all of them
to be wanting. In the process, we conclude that terrorism is rare
outside war zones because, to a substantial degree, terrorists don't
exist there. In general, as with rare diseases that kill few, it makes
more policy sense to expend limited funds on hazards that inflict far
more damage.

Terrorism is willed and may well become more destructive

Journalist Jeffrey Goldberg has suggested that "the fear of terrorism
isn't motivated solely by what terrorists have done, but what terrorists
hope to do." Bathtubs are simply not "engaged in a conspiracy with other
bathtubs to murder ever-larger numbers of Americans." However,
terrorists "in the Islamist orbit," he insists, "seek unconventional
weapons that would allow them to kill a far-larger number of Americans
than died on Sept. 11." 6 Or as Janan Ganesh of the Financial Times puts
it, "Bathroom deaths could multiply by 50 without a threat to civil
order. The incidence of terror could not." 7

Thus far, [9/11 stands out as an **extreme outlier**: scarcely any
terrorist act, before or after, in war zones or outside them, has
inflicted **even one-tenth**]{.underline} [as much]{.underline} total
[destruction]{.underline}. That is, contrary to common expectations,
[the attack has]{.underline} thus far [been an]{.underline}
[**aberration**, **not** a **harbinger**]{.underline}.8 And
[**[a]{.mark}**l-**[Q]{.mark}**aeda central]{.underline}, the group
responsible for the attack, [has]{.underline}, in some respects at
least, [[proved]{.mark} to resemble]{.underline} President John
Kennedy's assassin, [**Lee Harvey Oswald**---an entity
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [**[trivial proportions]{.underline}**
[that got]{.underline}]{.mark} **[horribly [lucky
once]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The tiny group of perhaps 100 or so does
appear to have served as something of an inspiration to some Muslim
extremists. They may have done some training, may have contributed a bit
to the Taliban's far larger insurgency in Afghanistan, and may have
participated in a few terrorist acts in Pakistan. In his examination of
the major terrorist plots against the West since 9/11, Mitchell Silber
finds only two---the shoe bomber attempt of 2001 and the effort to blow
up transatlantic airliners with liquid bombs in 2006---that could be
said to be under the "command and control" of al-Qaeda central (as
opposed to ones suggested, endorsed, or inspired by the organization),
and there are questions about how full its control was even in these two
instances, both of which, as it happens, failed miserably.9 And,
although some al-Qaeda affiliates have committed substantial damage in
the Middle East, usually in the context of civil wars, their efforts to
carry out terrorism in the West have been rare and completely
ineffective.10 Even under siege, it is difficult to see why al-Qaeda
could not have carried out attacks at least as costly and shocking as
the shooting rampages (organized by other groups) that took place in
Mumbai in 2008 or at a shopping center in Kenya in 2013. Neither took
huge resources, presented major logistical challenges, required the
organization of a large number of perpetrators, or needed extensive
planning.

However, [there is of course no guarantee that things will
**remain**]{.underline} [that way, and the 9/11 attacks inspired the
remarkable **extrapolation**]{.underline} [that, because the
[terrorists]{.mark} were **successful with box cutters**, they might
**soon** be [able to **turn**]{.mark} **out weapons of mass
destruction**--- particularly **[nuclear]{.mark}**]{.underline}
ones---and then detonate them in an American city. For example, in his
influential 2004 book, Nuclear Terrorism, Harvard's Graham
**[Allison]{.underline}** [relayed]{.underline} his "considered
judgment" [that]{.underline} "on the current path, [a nuclear terrorist
attack on America in the **decade**]{.underline} ahead [is]{.underline}
more **[likely]{.underline}** than not." 11 Allison has had a great deal
of company in his alarming pronouncements. In 2007, the distinguished
physicist Richard Garwin put the likelihood of a nuclear explosion on an
American or European city by terrorist or other means at 20 percent per
year, which would work out to 91 percent over the elevenyear period to
2018.12

**[Allison's time is up]{.underline}**, and so is Garwin's.
[These]{.underline} oft-repeated [[warnings have
proven]{.underline}]{.mark} to be **[[empty]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And
it is important to point out that [[not only]{.mark} have terrorists
**[failed]{.mark}** to go nuclear, [but]{.mark}]{.underline} as William
Langewiesche, who has assessed the process in detail, put it in 2007,
"[[The **best info**]{.mark}rmation [is]{.mark} that **[no one has
gotten]{.mark} anywhere [near]{.mark}**]{.underline} this. I mean, if
you look carefully and practically at this process, you see that [[it
is]{.mark} an **enormous undertaking**]{.underline} [[full of
**risks**]{.mark} for]{.underline} the would-be
[terrorists]{.underline}." 13 [That process [requires trusting
**corrupt**]{.mark}ed foreign [**collaborators**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} other [[**criminals**, obtaining]{.mark} and
transporting highly]{.underline} [[**guarded material**, setting
up]{.mark} a machine shop staffed with **[top
scientists]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[technicians]{.underline}**, [[and **rolling**]{.underline}
[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[heavy]{.underline}**, cumbersome, and
**[[untested]{.underline}]{.mark}** finished
**[[product]{.underline}]{.mark}** [into]{.underline}
**[position]{.underline}** [to be detonated [by a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[skilled crew]{.underline}**]{.mark}, all the [while [attracting **no
attention**]{.mark}]{.underline} from outsiders.

[[Nor]{.mark} have terrorist groups been [able to steal]{.mark} existing
nuclear]{.underline} [[weapons]{.mark}---characteristically burdened
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[multiple [safety
devices]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} often [stored
in]{.underline} pieces at separate **[secure
locales]{.underline}**---from existing arsenals as was once much feared.
[[And]{.underline}]{.mark} [they certainly have [not]{.mark} been able
to [cajole]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[leaders]{.underline}**]{.mark} in
nuclear states [[to]{.underline} **[palm one off]{.underline}**]{.mark}
to them---though a war inflicting more death than Hiroshima and Nagasaki
combined was launched against Iraq in 2003 in major part under the spell
of fantasies about such a handover.14

More generally, [the **actual [terrorist]{.mark}**]{.underline}
"adversarie**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [in the **West**]{.underline}
**[scarcely]{.underline}** [deserve accolades for either **dedication**
or **prowess**]{.underline}. It is true, of course, that sometimes even
incompetents can get lucky, but such instances, however tragic, are
rare. [For the most part, terrorists in the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [[are a
**confused**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[inadequate]{.underline}**,
**[[incompetent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[blundering]{.underline}**,
and **[gullible [bunch]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [only]{.underline}
**[occasionally]{.underline}** [able to get their act together. Most
seem to be far [better at **frenetic**]{.mark}]{.underline} and often
**[self-deluded [scheming]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[than]{.underline}]{.mark} at [actual
**[execution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A summary assessment by RAND's
Brian Jenkins is apt: "[their **numbers** remain **small**, their
**determination limp**, and their **competence poor**]{.underline}." 15
And much [the same holds for **Europe**]{.underline} [and the
**rest**]{.underline} [of the developed world]{.underline}.16 Also
working against terrorist success in the West is the fact that [almost
**[all]{.mark}** are **[amateurs]{.mark}**: they have never before tried
to do something like this. Unlike **criminals** they have **not been
able to develop street smarts**.]{.underline}

[Except perhaps for the use of vehicles to [deliver]{.mark}
mayhem]{.underline} (though this idea is by no means new in the history
of terrorism), [there has been]{.underline} remarkably **[[little
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in terrorist weaponry or methodology
since 9/11]{.underline}.17 Like their predecessors, [they have continued
to rely on bombs]{.underline} (many of which fail to detonate or do much
damage) [and bullets]{.underline}.18

Cautions and Caveats

It is important to note that [scientific advances and]{.underline} the
[**emergence** of **new tech**nologies are **not** the only, or even the
**most important**, factors **influencing** the [**likelihood** of
**terrorist**]{.mark} **group[s]{.mark}** acquiring and **[using CBRN
weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thankfully, the [[number of]{.mark}
terrorist [groups]{.mark} motivated to acquire these weapons [has been
limited, despite]{.mark} [many that have]{.mark}]{.underline} the
requisite [technical and financial [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}.60
The [**[vast majority]{.mark}** of **terrorist** groups have been
[**satisfied** with **conventional**]{.mark} **weapons**]{.underline}
such as guns and bombs. The surprising rise of the Islamic State and
their repeated use of chemical weapons in Iraq and Syria, however, serve
as a reminder that it only takes one group with the intent and
capability to acquire and use CBRN weapons to pose a threat to
international security.61

In addition, the [[ability]{.mark} of a terrorist group to convert
CBRN-related material into a weapon [depends on]{.mark}]{.underline}
intangible factors such as **[[tacit knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(the unarticulated knowledge that can only be gained through hands-on,
trial-and-error experience or mentorship), the [**ability** of the group
to **create and share** such **knowledge**, [and its ability to
**assemble**]{.mark} and successfully **manage** **interdisciplinary
teams**]{.underline}.62 [Terrorist [groups]{.mark}, especially those
**facing pressure** from **law enforcement** and **intel**ligence
agencies, [have had **difficulties** **recruiting**]{.mark},
**retaining**, [and]{.mark} effectively [**utilizing** individuals
with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [right **combination** of **scientific**,
**technical**, and **organizational [skills]{.mark}** to develop
effective CBRN weapons]{.underline}.

[Developing a CBRN weapon capable of]{.underline} causing [**mass
casualties** is also a **very complex** process. A scientific
[breakthrough that makes]{.mark} **developing** or acquiring **[one
component]{.mark}**]{.underline} of a weapon [[easier]{.mark} might [not
have any impact on]{.mark} the [other stages]{.mark} in the
weaponization process]{.underline}. Thus, the [impact of a single
scientific breakthrough]{.underline} or a novel technology on the
acquisition of a CBRN weapon [should not be exaggerated]{.underline}.
For example, [**[syn]{.mark}**thetic **[bio]{.mark}**logy might make it
easier]{.underline} for a non-state actor [to create]{.underline} a
pathogen, [but]{.underline} that technology [**[does not help]{.mark}**
terrorists improve their **[ability to disseminate]{.mark}** the
pathogen on a large scale]{.underline}.63

Likewise, it is important to assess the [specific contributions that a
particular technology can make to a specific aspect of]{.underline} the
[CBRN threat in practice, not just in theory]{.underline}. In the case
of [[3D printing]{.underline}]{.mark}, this manufacturing technology [is
**[not appropriate]{.mark}** for working with **[metals]{.mark}** that
[are **toxic** or **radioactive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
microreactors are well-suited to covertly producing small quantities of
highly pure chemicals, [they are **not well-suited** to]{.underline} the
[production of **most chemical warfare agents**]{.underline} and
precursors [due to **[excessive heat]{.mark}** generated]{.underline} by
their synthesis [[and]{.mark} by the **production** of **[solid
byproducts]{.mark}** that would **[clog]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[microfluidic [channels]{.mark}]{.underline}** at the heart of this
technology.64

Finally, [[advances in]{.mark} science and **[tech]{.mark}**nology
represent]{.underline} not just threats, but also [opportunities to
[make it harder]{.mark} for terrorist groups [to acquire]{.mark} CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nmanned
**[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**erial and ground
**[[v]{.underline}]{.mark}**ehicle**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [can be
[used for border security]{.mark}, CBRN weapon [detection, and]{.mark}
bomb [disposal]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the EU is sponsoring
the development of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles to investigate
CBRN crime scenes under the ROCSAFE project.65 [[Biometrics]{.mark} and
radio frequency ID chips can be used to [improve **physical
security**]{.mark} **measures** and **inventory control** to prevent
unauthorized access to CBRN materials]{.underline}. Advances in science
and technology are also leading to **[improved
[sensors]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [can be used to [detect]{.mark} the
**[production]{.mark}**, **transportation**, and **use** of CBRN
weapons]{.underline}. The [development of dedicated laboratories and new
techniques to analyze CBRN materials has also contributed to impressive
advances in nuclear, biological, and chemical forensics, which are
crucial for attribution]{.underline}.66

Ross and Stephen Tankel who [**[argue]{.mark}** that **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[a]{.mark}ssistance** "[is]{.mark} focused [on the **wrong countries**
and]{.mark} being used to build the **wrong
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Their idea is [that competition
with China and Russia - **great power competition**]{.underline} (GPC) -
[is the priority and all instruments of national power must be bent to
that end, at the expense of all other needs]{.underline}. Ross and
Tankel conclude that the "United States is no longer well-positioned to
use security sector assistance to "compete with China and Russia ---
especially in 'gray zone' activities short of war." Ross is a former
assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation and should know
better.

Changes in administrations are [an opportunity to **[reflect on what
works and]{.mark} what [doesn't]{.mark}**[, **but**]{.mark} in this
case, **[changes]{.mark}** in the name of so-called reform [could
**cause real harm**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They suggest, in part,
converting what are known as building partner capacity (BPC) funds into
general-purpose security assistance funds so they may explicitly be used
for Great Power Competition --- that is, to block China and Russia. That
is a fine goal, but there are greater and more effective tools already
in use. Security assistance writ large, about \$19 billion dollars in
2019, and the deterrent effect of the U.S. armed forces being forward
stationed and deployed around the world. Besides, Congress created
specific categories of activities in for BPC which lie in the gray zone
like counter terrorism operations, countering illicit drug trafficking,
countering organized crime, supporting intelligence operations and
supporting multi-national operations- like AMISOM in Somalia and the G5
Sahel. These funds are critical in providing equipment and training
support against various insurgent, transnational terrorists and
smuggling threats in twenty-one countries.
**[[Moving]{.underline}]{.mark}** those **[[funds]{.underline}]{.mark}**
from these conflicts [[to support **great-power competition**]{.mark}
would result in the **[abandon]{.mark}ment** of those [partners]{.mark}
who are [now]{.mark} decisively [engaged]{.mark} on the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' behalf. [There is **real
danger** to a U.S. withdrawal of support to these fragile
partners]{.underline}.

What are building partner capacity funds? They are a basket of
congressional authorizations meant to counter urgent and emergent
threats. In various forms, they have been around for three
administrations. In the early 2000s, the DOD needed an authorization to
quickly buttress and fund operations with smaller countries not in
formal alliances like NATO or through the cumbersome existing security
assistance framework of foreign military financing and sales. The
zeitgeist of BPC funds was to quickly provide rifles, trucks, radios,
and ammunition, along with training, to partner states who were fighting
terrorists and insurgencies that were critical to U.S. security. These
funds were meant for partner states actually engaged in the business of
killing bad guys. Beyond Iraq and Afghanistan, which gobbled up billions
of dollars, building partner capacity funds have been small. BPC funds
have gone through several iterations since their introduction in 2006.
The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act re-authorized the largest
part of the funds under section 333. They have never exceeded 1 percent
of the DOD budget. In 2020, 333 Global Train and Equip fund, made up
less than 0.14% of the defense budget.

Where have 333 funds been used? Since 2017, they have been used in
Burkina Faso, Chad, Cameroon, supporting Uganda, Kenya, and Djibouti in
the UN mission in Somalia. Worldwide, they have been used in the
Philippines, Vietnam, Jordan, Uzbekistan and even Mexico. Earlier
versions of BPC funds were used in Hungary, Indonesia, Georgia, Latvia,
Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Poland and
Romania. In Africa in particular, the need is urgent. That is exactly
where these funds should be deployed to allow the rest of the billions
and billions of dollars of security assistance to be spent more directly
against China and Russia in.

A Holding Action

First and foremost, building partner capacity is a holding action, a
strategic defensive effort in order that the United States and its
Allies can deter Russia and China with infantry divisions, fighter jets
and aircraft carriers in other theaters. Building partner capacity (BPC)
funds are not meant to be decisive. They buy time against the violence
and instability of the gray zone. That zone is where malign actors
create chaos and seek to replace legitimate authority in its wake. On
one side is the area the U.S. and the international community can
access, and on the other, are the forces that seek to confront the U.S.
In Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, attacks by Islamic State and al Qaeda
affiliates have increased dramatically since 2015, with more than 4000
deaths reported in 2019. The U.S. must stay engaged in that gray zone.
This is the penultimate problem with the assertion that security
assistance is out of sync with U.S. priorities and these "shortcomings
hinder U.S. allies and partners, in turn leaving them vulnerable to
Chinese and Russian influence" that reveals a deep misunderstanding of
the strategy behind BPC funds. BPC funds are exactly how the U.S.
remains engaged in competition with Russia and China in the gray zone.

[A withdrawal of BPC funds or **redirection** in their uses would be
**tantamount to abandonment** of the ideals of building up
partners]{.underline}. [The Department of Defense could **[just find
itself in a deeper hole]{.mark} ten [years hence]{.mark}**, anxiously
**[requesting]{.mark} another [funding]{.mark} stream [to counter the
same, bigger]{.mark}, more dangerous [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
That is on the horizon: For example, Burkina Faso is the focal point of
an increasingly complex regional war in which jihadist groups take
advantage of nonexistent border security. This in turn has exacerbated
and amplified local grievances about corruption and bad governance. An
attack killed 36 in a village market in January 2020, and in October,
another 20 were killed in the north of the country. The violence moves
across international borders with impunity. This is typical of the vast
trans-Sahel region in which the reach of the central state governments
closely follows the roads and towns, with millions of square kilometers
of scrub and desert left with only the lightest touch of government
authority. In 2012, the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad
in Mali teamed up with heavily armed Toureg nomads back from the Libyan
Civil war. The group captured key cities and declared northern Mali an
Islamic state. The short, sharp civil war toppled the Malian president
in a coup in March 2012, resulting in the French Government deploying
4,000 soldiers to push back the Islamist groups. In August 2020, another
coup toppled the latest leader of Mali. Building partner capacity funds
are used in each country for air reconnaissance assets, long range
communications, and heavy-duty desert vehicles, along with training on
how to tie them all together in operations. This contributes to
partner's internal stability, thus keeping them in the fold of
international norms and values, and more resistant to Chinese and
Russian influence.

China and Russia behind the Gray Zone

If the U.S. pulls back from these areas of conflict, China and Russia
will step in. In many cases, it is because of the security situation and
corruption that U.S. companies hesitate to operate. For China and
Russia, concerns over human rights abuses matter little. Chinese
investment in Africa tops \$200 billion per year and since 2015, Beijing
has provided \$120 billion in financial aid. In Burkina Faso, China is
building a \$140 million hospital and a \$1.3 billion dollar road. In
Guinea, another west African country, China has provided \$20 billion in
loans to develop bauxite mines and another \$14 billion for iron
developments. In Mali, the Chinese have invested \$11 billion in
infrastructure deals.

It is true that many of these failing states are run by corrupt,
narcissistic family and clan confederations whose human rights records
are little better than the insurgent terrorists who seek to replace
them. Security assistance funds provide an important foot in the door
for the U.S. in these developing nations. It is particularly important
because these weak countries view many of the U.S. State Department's
activities as subversive and possibly corrosive to their own authority.
Building partner capacity (BPC) funds are security funds and that is
simple enough to understand. If this 'foot-in-the-door' is removed,
Chinese dollars will work just as well, their thinking goes. If the U.S.
were to retreat along the line presented by Ross and Tankel, the line of
instability would move, allowing the space behind to be filled by Russia
and particularly, China. The places where Chinese money is invested
would need security and already China has peacekeepers in Congo,
Liberia, Mali, Sudan and South Sudan. China also partially funds the G5
Sahel Joint Force.

Perhaps more baldly, and thus more surprising that Ross and Tankel
missed it, these small countries vote in the big international
organizations, like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization.
These potential allies will be needed in the coalitions of international
cooperation that President Joe Biden looks to lead. Thwarting Russia and
China short of actual war will require a broad coalition of countries
voting on issues ranging from climate change to fair trade. Already,
China uses dollar diplomacy to keep vulnerable, weak states in its
orbit. It won over Burkina Faso in 2019, at the same time China offered
to pay for security forces in the Sahel. BPC funds, for all their
simplicity, can help buy votes, too.

The Last 1%?

Great power competition is real and is the priority of the Department of
Defense. Ross and Tankel are correct in that. However, they lose sight
of the billions and billions spent on great power competition. Since it
is the priority, one could say that great-power competition consumes 99%
of the Department of Defense budget. That is tanks, aircraft carriers,
attack helicopters and missiles. That is personnel and their pay and
benefits. That is all the training and exercises in the plains of
central Europe and the seas in Southeast Asia. The U.S ability to
curtail Chinese and Russian expansion in the gray zone is enormously
important. Why would the last 1% be eyed for use in Europe and Northeast
Asia?

It is because the bureaucracy simply cannot imagine low-level conflict
as a useful means to a larger end. Slow to adapt, grinding, and loath to
change, the Department of Defense was created for great power war and it
requires expensive kit- missile defense, ships, tanks and fighter jets
like the trillion dollar F35 and B21 programs, and the Gerald Ford
aircraft carrier. Security assistance, run through the State Department,
and the even bigger foreign military sales efforts have provided this
kind of equipment since the 1960s. There is seduction in the simplicity
of big wars. They are easy to understand, plan for, and win. From
pre-commissioning training to the flag officer level, planning is
oriented toward maneuvering divisions, corps and carrier air wings, the
gotterdammerung of the decisive battle (a horrible misapplication of
Clausewitz). This is the American way of war, with technology, mass, and
speed. [Unfortunately, [this creates]{.mark}]{.underline} an amaranthine
loop of organizational bias and [**[coercive info]{.mark}rmation
[processing routines]{.mark}** that in turn produce values and norms
about the way things are and the way things should be]{.underline}. BPC
funds are meant for smaller, simpler tasks, not part of the U.S. main
effort in its big wars. After 9/11 the Department of Defense needed a
tool for engagement- thus the creation of these types of funds. Planning
and execution have proceeded apace since. Ross and Tankel have also
taken to task the planning superstructure for these funds. Their
suggestion of creating "coordinated, department-wide planning processes
at the departments of State and Defense" is also wide of the mark.
[There is already a joint review and approval process that begins
eighteen to twenty-four months out from execution. There is even a
capstone review conference called the Joint Security Sector Assistance
Review that seeks to capture issues and recommendations for improvement
in future execution cycles. **[Creating new]{.mark}**]{.underline} human
infrastructure, [boards, bureaus, cells, and [**diagrams** would
**invite more** of the very "**inefficient and incoherent
planning**]{.mark} **and coordination [processes]{.mark}**["
that]{.mark}]{.underline} Ross and Tankel [[seek to
improve]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Considering the price point and investment level of BPC funds, they have
been successful. They have paid for support to the AMISOM peacekeeping
mission in Somalia and strengthened the Jordanian efforts against ISIS
and Al Qaeda. They proved instrumental in providing real capabilities in
Tunisia's struggle against trans-national violence spilling over from
Libya. The 333 funds, and other, even smaller building partner capacity
authorizations have made a difference in these places where the average
cost per capacity building program is just \$5.5 million. There does
exist the dubious idea is that these small funds could be deployed
quickly to support and guide partners towards larger, and much more
lucrative purchases of military equipment. This destroys the original
intent of 333 funds. Congress has seen the importance of having separate
authorities to do separate things, and this should be preserved. If BPC
funds are amalgamated into the framework that provides big weapons and
expensive capabilities, like fighter-jets, hyper-advanced, secure
communications, and cyber security apparatus, it will take away, in some
cases, the only incentive for partners to meet and fight terrorists. The
knock-on effect is losing a strong method for deterring method of
deterring Chinese and Russian aspirations in these gray zones.

Conclusion

[[Overall]{.mark}, the U.S. [spends]{.mark} about **\$[18 billion
globally]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} various **[s]{.mark}ecurity
[a]{.mark}ssistance** authorizations. The question that appears not to
be asked in wise councils is \"**[Would this tiny .14% make a difference
in great power competition?]{.mark}**\" [**Already**, the **vast
majority**]{.mark} of **security assistance** funding **does go towards
great power competition** via foreign military financing and
sales]{.underline}. Other initiatives are not small. The European
Deterrence Initiative focused on Russia sits at \$6 billion, the Ukraine
Security Assistance Initiative, provides \$250 million, the Southeast
Asia Maritime Security Initiative is funded at \$425 million. Congress
is set to authorize the Pacific Deterrence Initiative with has much as
\$6 billion over two years. Now, the bureaucracy wants the .14 percent
of the budget meant to fight terrorism around the world.

Finally, [the U.S. [pays]{.mark} **\$[700 billion]{.mark}** a year [for
the **world's largest defense establishment**]{.mark} on the premise
that this **massive juggernaut** is **needed [for deterrence]{.mark}**.
In this case, [it **doesn't make sense** that **another \$700 million
will make a difference**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The very idea is
staggering: Is there no deterrent effect in all those divisions and
aircraft carriers? There is, however, a very real deterrent in
strengthening small partners quickly and effectively. [The
**D**epartment **o**f **D**efense **can walk and chew gum** at the same
time]{.underline}. At least Congress thinks so, hence the categories
legislated in the building partner capacity authorization. The U.S. will
not send infantry divisions to west Africa; it can and should support
governments in improving their own security. [The DOD can confront
China, Russia and provide capacity support to friends in the
fight]{.underline}. For less than a billion dollars a year, the decision
is a no-brainer.

[Within the **international development** arena, the past few years has
witnessed a move towards measured, progress-focused development, as
illustrated by the birth of terms such as "effective aid " and "managing
for development results " at various international forums]{.underline}.
For example, at a global meeting of development partners in 2004, , the
discussions centred on how to strengthen an international partnership
around the concept of 'managing for development results'. [This upped
the stakes for **monitoring and evaluation** (**M&E**)]{.underline}, in
the sense that the Joint Memorandum, which was issued by all these
global partners at the end of their meeting, focused not only on M&E
processes itself, but also on using results for improvement and
decision-making.

"\[We will\] rely on -- and strengthen -- countries' monitoring and
evaluation systems to track progress and assess outcomes. As agencies
with regional or global reach, we pledge to better distill the lessons
of countries' experiences and disseminate knowledge about what gets
results in different country contexts."

Joint Memorandum, issued by all global development partners at the end
of the 2nd Roundtable on Managing for Development Results

[**[Despite pressure]{.mark}** from international development partners
to measure and quantify results, [**M&E** has **remained the ugly
duckling** of **development**. **Efforts to incorporate it into
practice** have met with a combination of **apathy**, **resistance**,
and **half-baked efforts**]{.mark} that primarily consisted of
**[throwing together a few indicators]{.mark}** and defining how the
data would be collected]{.underline}.

[Developments in the field of **HIV/AIDS** monitoring and evaluation
over the last 10 years [has illustrated the challenges of]{.mark}
monitoring and evaluating of **development efforts in general**, and
raised some uncomfortable, close-to-home questions for the development
**[M&E]{.mark}** profession]{.underline}.

In Africa in particular, HIV/AIDS M&E is not only important because of
international pressure on managing for development results, but also
because of the scale of the virus's impact. HIV/AIDS has ravaged Africa.
A continent-wide Social Impact Assessment would have revealed that it
has destroyed families, torn apart communities, paralysed the health
sector, crippled the agricultural and education sectors, hampered
government's efforts to provide effective services to its people, and
caused indescribable long-term trauma and grief. The extent and reach of
its impact over such a short period of time is forcing national AIDS
coordinating structures to focus, maybe for the first time, on ways to
find real, effective, efficient, and replicable solutions.

At the international level and at the country level, the response to
HIV/AIDS has moved in the past 10 years from a health sector-driven to a
multisectoral response. In parallel, HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation
has evolved from exclusively epidemiological surveillance in the 1980s
to multi discipline approaches to HIV/AIDS M&E.

B What are the challenges?

HIV/AIDS M&E cannot be a disjointed collection of evaluation studies and
monitoring processes, but needs one integrated HIV/AIDS M&E system,
managed by a National AIDS Commission (NAC) MG comment: some countries
do not have NACs, so it may be better to refer to it as the national
AIDS coordinating structures. This is because the NAC has the mandate to
coordinate and manage the national HIV response and can only do this if
it has accurate and relevant data when decisions need to be made. It is
also because it was recently acknowledged, internationally, that one M&E
framework at country level is one of the core principles of effective
management of the HIV response .

Such an HIV/AIDS M&E system needs to combine a vast variety of M&E
processes: from biological sentinel surveillance (an epidemiological
"tripwire" used to detect trends in HIV infection); to routine
collection of management information about funding for HIV interventions
in the public sector, private sector and civil society; and
ethnographic-type studies about sexual risk behaviour and the abuse of
right of vulnerable children, the elderly and persons living with AIDS.

HIV/AIDS M&E requires that, in order to assess the extent and nature of
HIV service coverage, the same output-level, programme-monitoring data
be collected from all implementers of HIV interventions on a routine
basis. The health sector in Africa has struggled to establish an
effective management information system in its own sector -- NACs are
now obliged to set up a such a routine system across all government
ministries, the private sector, and the entire civil society. This is a
vast undertaking, especially given that some of these organisations have
never had to report to government before. Another challenge is that the
HIV response is increasingly becoming decentralised. This adds a layer
of reporting and could potentially cause delays in data collection.

HIV interventions range dramatically in content, focus, and
implementation methodology. For example, interventions focusing on
establishing partnerships for HIV will have vastly different monitoring
and evaluation approaches to programmes that aim to keep educationally
marginalised children in school.

The impact of HIV has necessitated that there is a real focus on using
results for decision-making and programme improvement because countries
in Africa heavily burdened by HIV/AIDS cannot afford not to.

B What can be done?

Addressing these challenges requires a systemic approach: we need to
focus on designing and operationalising national HIV/AIDS M&E systems,
rather than new evaluation studies.

Figure 1 illustrates such a systemic approach to HIV/AIDS M&E. It shows
the relationship between indicators (A), data sources (B), information
products (C) and the project stakeholders (D). These four components
will only work in unison if it is backed up by strong management.

Figure 1: Illustration of Systemic Approach to HIV/AIDS M&E

At the risk of revamping an old development phrase, a systemic approach
to HIV/AIDS M&E require those involved in the M&E profession to change.
It requires a paradigm shift away from conducting piecemeal,
complicated, and specialised monitoring or evaluation studies and
towards thinking about monitoring and evaluation in an operational way,
focusing on synergies, sometimes at the expense of individual academic
accolades.

B The Way Forward

Such an approach requires that M&E professionals:

•Learn new skills: they need to become good budgeters, M&E work plan
developers and M&E strategists.

•Move away from focusing on specific processes and towards integrated
monitoring and evaluation systems, which re-examines the practicalities
of collecting output data.

•Use existing tools in a new way: For example, Social Impact Assessments
have, to date, primarily been used to assess the impact of planned
developments (e.g. assessing the social impact of a new mine on a
community's livelihood). The tools in the quiver of the Social Impact
Assessment process (including trend extensions, computer modelling,
consulting experts, focus group discussion and questionnaires) could be
adapted to even suit assessments of the unplanned, catalytic, and
widespread impact of HIV and AIDS on different sectors of society.

•Assess the cost-benefit trade-off in different monitoring and
evaluation tools and processes to find, recommend, and use those
processes that are most useful for the most reasonable cost

•Be prepared to sacrifice some professional autonomy for the sake of
synchronisation. In one country in Africa, in 2004, over 40 assessments
relating to HIV/AIDS M&E were done, often replicating each other.

•Understand how HIV/AIDS M&E systems should be managed to yield the best
possible success; it implies advocacy for M&E, capacity building in M&E
and communications about M&E

•Find a renewed focus to make sure that results are used to improve
projects.

•Go back to the basics of data collection, and apply it with new vigour
in a multi-sectoral, decentralised, developing and emergency context.

•Think of practical ways in which to focus on, promote and
institutionalise the process of using results for decision-making. This
means moving away from the typical thinking in which M&E systems have
focused on indicators and data sources, with less focus on information
products and dissemination to stakeholders (see Figure 2). It also
implies avoiding a situation where stakeholder dissemination is done as
an afterthought, primarily through a national level workshop.

Figure 2: Disproportionate focus on Indicators and Data Sources

The challenges of HIV/AIDS monitoring and evaluation systems cut to the
heart of the monitoring and evaluation profession. Although we have
always known that monitoring and evaluation needs to earn its keep
(Patton, 2000), it is nowhere more evident than in the design and
implementation of HIV/AIDS M&E systems. **[[Every dollar that is spent
on monitoring and evaluation is one that it not spent
on]{.underline}]{.mark}** HIV **[[programme
implementation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Within the context of HIV/AIDS,
[[this **can**]{.mark} **simply [not be wasted]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

HIVAIDS is an opportunity for our profession to prove M&E as a real,
tangible and value adding part of development work, and as an
opportunity for professionals to demystify monitoring and evaluation. We
have a responsibility to do so, and there has never been a better time.

#### Even if it works, results [won't be used]{.underline} effectively

We don't need to preach to the choir: given the plethora of data-related
projects that donors and development finance institutions (DFIs) have
supported in the past, they clearly know that data is a powerful tool
for advancing financial inclusion. And there is a lot to be excited
about, given how digital technologies are accelerating the speed, depth
and breadth of available data.

We share this excitement. In fact, data is at the heart of CGAP's work.
In recent years, we have talked about data-based segmentation to better
serve customers, data sharing to enable innovation, data protection and
how data capabilities need to be revamped to implement risk-based
supervision.

But is data just the latest shiny object of the financial inclusion
community? Are data's powers fully leveraged? Does more data lead to
sustainable impact?

Today, we think the jury is out on all three of these questions. [Our
[**research** shows]{.mark} that [**more and better data** in the hands
of]{.mark} providers, regulators, **[policy makers]{.mark}**, investors
and customers **[doesn't automatically lead to better
outcomes]{.mark}**. Results **[often]{.mark}** show that these market
actors [**do not use data** or]{.mark} have **[stopped]{.mark} using
data [after a while]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That's why, for us, the real excitement lies beyond data. It is about
bringing fresh thinking to help donors and DFIs achieve sustainable
impact through their data efforts. Based on our research, we have four
recommendations:

[[**Do not overestimate data** as a **driver of change**]{.mark}.
**[Increased knowledge]{.mark}** with data [does **not**]{.mark}
necessarily [incentivize **behavior change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, robust data on women\'s demand and need for financial services
will not automatically lead providers to improve their suite of products
and services. A detailed theory of change (ToC) will help donors and
DFIs to clarify the chain of incentives and behavior changes that a data
initiative seeks to trigger. Make sure the pathway from data to expected
outcomes is clear.

### Thumper -- Ukraine

#### [Ukraine thumps]{.underline} -- and more [unexpected]{.underline} arms increases are coming

Russia intensified its assault on a strategic Ukrainian city on Tuesday
as [**[NATO]{.mark}** officials]{.underline} prepared to [debate
**[increased military support]{.mark}** for Kyiv's attempt to reverse
Russian momentum]{.underline} in the country's east.

Officials in the eastern city of Severodonetsk said that Ukrainian
forces were mounting a pitched defense of an area that is now a central
focus of Russian firepower. Mayor Oleksandr Stryuk described "constant
fighting" for Severodonetsk, which has become increasingly isolated
following the destruction of bridges leading out of the city. He said
Russian troops so far have been unable to complete their control of the
area.

"Street fighting is underway," Stryuk said. "Tactically, our armed
forces are pushing back the enemy," an effort that he said relies on a
"huge amount of manpower."

Serhiy Haidai, governor of the Luhansk region where Severodonetsk is
located, said that humanitarian supplies could no longer be delivered to
the city. The two sides have exchanged accusations about who is
responsible for destroying the bridges, which permit the movement of
civilians and aid but also military equipment and troops.

Capturing Severodonetsk and neighboring Lysychansk, which lies across
the Siversky Donets river, would represent a major step forward in
President Vladimir Putin's quest to solidify control of eastern Ukraine,
and would mark a Russian revival following the battlefield failures that
characterized the early stage of the war.

Even as Ukrainian forces face mounting setbacks in the Donbas campaign,
officials in Kyiv have vowed to retake every inch of Russian-controlled
territory, including Crimea, which Russia annexed in 2014, but they say
greater outside help is required.

Haidai said conditions for civilians remaining in Severodonesk are now
"extremely difficult." In echoes of the extended siege of the southern
city of Mariupol, officials have said that some 500 people, including
dozens of children, are sheltering in bunkers beneath the city's Azot
chemical plant.

On Tuesday, a top Russian military official offered a humanitarian
corridor to permit the evacuation of civilians trapped at the plant. In
a statement, Col. Gen. Mikhail Mizintsev said the evacuees would be
permitted to travel to the Russian-controlled city of Svatove. Ukrainian
civilians forced to evacuate to areas under Russian control have
complained of abuse and degrading treatment at filtration camps.

Mizintsev, who heads Russia's National Defense Control Center, accused
Ukraine of positioning civilians at the plant as human shields. He
demanded the surrender of Ukrainian troops there, characterizing them as
"militants of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries."

[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky renewed his appeal]{.underline}
on Tuesday [for greater military aid to help Ukraine defend
itself]{.underline} in Luhansk and other areas, [saying that only
greater quantities of air and missile defense systems can help stave off
Russia's larger, more advanced military]{.underline}. Those weapons are
expected to be of increased importance in the artillery-heavy battle for
the Donbas region.

Zelensky cited missile attacks near Lviv and Ternopil on Tuesday, which
he said Ukrainian forces had been able to only partially defend against.

"We keep telling our partners that Ukraine needs modern antimissile
weapons. Our country does not have it at a sufficient level yet," he
said in a nightly video address. "Delay with its provision cannot be
justified."

How much new weaponry is provided, and what kind, may be defined on
Wednesday when officials gather in Brussels for a meeting of the s
Ukraine "defense contact group," which will be chaired by U.S. Defense
Secretary Lloyd Austin.

Austin touched down in Belgium on Tuesday ahead of that gathering, which
is expected to include up to 50 countries, and a separate meeting of
NATO defense ministers being held ahead of a June 29 alliance summit in
Madrid.

When NATO foreign ministers convened in April, Ukraine told the alliance
its priority issue was "weapons, weapons, weapons" --- a message that is
likely to be reiterated this week as the conflict drags through its
fourth month.

[While]{.underline} the [Biden]{.underline} administration [has not
revealed]{.underline} its [plans, [the **Pentagon's top policy
official**]{.mark}]{.underline} on Tuesday [[suggested **it would send
additional**]{.mark} **multiple-launch rocket [systems]{.mark} to
Ukraine**, potentially **[going farther to satisfy Ukrainian
demands]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Colin Kahl, who serves as undersecretary of defense for policy, said
the]{.underline} four M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket
[[Systems]{.underline}]{.mark}, which can hit targets at longer
distance, [that Washington has [sent]{.mark} to Ukraine **[to date did
not represent the end]{.mark} of its supply** of such
weapons]{.underline}.

["**[We're going to provide the Ukrainians what they
need]{.mark}**]{.underline} to prosecute the targets inside Ukrainian
territory," [Kahl said]{.underline} during a think tank event in
Washington. Ukrainian officials have said they need at least 60 such
systems.

Western leaders [have gradually **[increased the array of arms they are
willing to provide]{.mark}** Ukraine since the beginning of the
war]{.underline}. But many remain nervous about supplying systems that
could be used to launch attacks deep into Russian territory or that
Putin might use as a reason to strike a NATO country.

In separate discussions in Brussels on Thursday, NATO allies are
expected to discuss a range of broader issues, including the alliance's
troop footprint in Eastern Europe and defense spending, conversations
that will continue at the late June summit in Madrid.

#### Ukraine will remain a [more urgent priority]{.underline}

**DoS 6-1**-22 U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Political-Military
Affairs, "U.S. Security Cooperation with Ukraine," Fact Sheet, 6-1-2022,

The United States, our allies, and our partners worldwide are united in
support of Ukraine in response to Russia's premeditated, unprovoked, and
unjustified war against Ukraine. We have not forgotten Russia's earlier
aggression in eastern Ukraine and occupation following its unlawful
seizure of Crimea in 2014. The United States reaffirms its unwavering
support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its
internationally recognized borders, extending to its territorial waters.

[**Ukraine** is a key regional strategic partner that has undertaken
significant efforts to modernize its military and increase its
interoperability with NATO. [**It remains an urgent security assistance
priority** to provide **Ukraine** the equipment it needs]{.mark} to
defend itself against Russia's war against Ukraine]{.underline}.

Since January 2021, the United States has invested more than \$5.3
billion in security assistance to demonstrate our enduring and steadfast
commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This
includes more than \$4.6 billion since Russia's launched its
premeditated, unprovoked, and brutal war against Ukraine on February 24.
Since 2014, the United States has provided more than \$7.3 billion in
security assistance for training and equipment to help Ukraine preserve
its territorial integrity, secure its borders, and improve
interoperability with NATO.

### Thumper -- Taiwan

#### [Taiwan thumps]{.underline} -- it's being [prioritized]{.underline}

**Nakamura 6-13**-22 Ryo Nakamura, Nikkei staff writer, "U.S., Taiwan
set to hold strategic dialogue this month: sources," Nikkei Asia,
6-13-2022,
<https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/U.S.-Taiwan-set-to-hold-strategic-dialogue-this-month-sources>
/GoGreen!

[[The **U.S.** and **Taiwan**]{.mark} are in the **final stages** of
preparation for a strategic bilateral dialogue between security
officials]{.underline}, three people with knowledge of the matter told
Nikkei.

The dialogue, [scheduled to take place **[by the end of this
month]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the U.S., is [[expected to focus
on]{.mark} specific measures for [**weapons provision** and **military
drills**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Officials [from]{.mark} the two sides will discuss details of
**[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation**]{.underline} under a regular
framework known as the \"Monterey talks\" \-- last held in autumn 2021
in the U.S., according to Taiwanese media. As a general rule, neither
plans for the talks nor details are publicly disclosed.

[One of the sources said the key theme for the upcoming dialogue would
be weapons support from the U.S., with [Washington **aiming to
prioritize** the **sale of weapons**]{.mark} that would be effective in
blocking potential Chinese landing operations on the
island]{.underline}.

The U.S. [**[Congress]{.mark}** is considering a [plan to provide
**several billion dollars**]{.mark} of financial support to Taiwan so
the island can procure weapons]{.underline}, Nikkei reported last month,
citing three sources connected to the legislature.

The **[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration [**[intends to
prioritize]{.mark}** the sale of weapons with what it calls
\"**[asymmetric capabilities]{.mark}**\" \-- those that are agile,
inexpensive and effective in dealing with Chinese amphibious operations.
Specifically]{.underline}, they cover [anti-ship missiles and air
defense systems, as well as systems for gathering
intelligence]{.underline} needed to identify enemy movements and for
initiating early warnings.

But F-16 fighter jets, which the U.S. government has already decided to
sell to Taiwan, might not fall under this category. This implies that
the bar for additional fighter jet sales may be set higher in the
future.

[By **prioritizing** asymmetric weapons, the U.S. intends to quicken
reinforcement of capabilities in preventing the Chinese military from
landing operations on Taiwan]{.underline}. It also aims to encourage
Taiwan to allocate its budget more efficiently on the defense front.

It appears that the U.S. has prepared a list of weapons and systems it
recommends Taiwan to purchase, and selected about 20 specific weapons
and other items as preferred subjects of sale.

Taiwan was a hot theme at the weekend\'s Shangri-La Dialogue security
summit in Singapore.

\"Now, as a part of our One China policy, we will continue to fulfill
our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act,\" U.S. Defense Secretary
Lloyd Austin said on Saturday. \"And that includes assisting Taiwan in
maintaining a sufficient self-defense capability.\"

### N/L -- No Tradeoff + Thumpers

#### NO link uniqueness NOR internal link -- there will [always]{.underline} be a [higher-priority]{.underline} SC crisis -- [Ukraine]{.underline} and [Taiwan]{.underline} thump -- AND [black swans]{.underline} are inevitable -- BUT DoD planners [can walk and chew gum]{.underline}

**Sprenger 22** Sebastian Sprenger, Europe editor and former managing

loom," Defense News, 1-28-2022,

/GoGreen!

As roughly 100,000 Russian troops amass around [**Ukraine**, [a **series
of emerging crises**]{.mark} around the world --- the **Mid**dle
**East**, **China**, **No**rth **Ko**rea --- [are **demanding the full
attention** of **NATO**, and]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly its most
powerful member, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

Now, there's a growing sense among national security experts that the
crisis in [**[Ukraine]{.mark}** is [just **one of many**]{.mark}
conflicts]{.underline} on the precipice, [putting pressure on the
alliance and its member countries to address this threat and at the same
time brace for the next one]{.underline}.

Indeed, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** this week [flew 39 warplanes
toward **[Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And consider the United Arab
Emirates reported this week it had intercepted multiple ballistic
missiles aimed at Abu Dhabi.

Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, described the ongoing
dispute between Russia and Ukraine as a "microcosm" of the types of
threats Western analysts were expecting all along. "All of this is
becoming very real," she said this week at a panel in Brussels sponsored
by [the German Marshall Fund of the United States]{.underline}.

At the same time, "[**[something could happen]{.mark}** on China and
Taiwan **[next week]{.mark}**," said Ian Lesser, vice president at the
think tank]{.underline}, referring to the possibility of China attacking
the U.S.-backed island nation that Beijing sees as a renegade province
to be eventually united with the mainland.

Asked about that possibility on Thursday, [**[Defense]{.mark}**
Department spokesman John Kirby [said]{.mark}]{.underline} the military
remains watchful of other theaters.

"I think [the gist]{.underline} of your question [is, why can't [we
**walk and chew gum at the same time**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he told
reporters at the Pentagon. "[We **can**, and we **are**. ... [Just
because we're focused on **bolstering our allies** because
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the worrisome accumulation of combat-credible
power by [the Russians in and around [**Ukraine** doesn't mean]{.mark}
that [we aren't focused on]{.mark} the pacing challenge that
**[China]{.mark}** represents]{.underline} to the department."

As NATO tries to use diplomacy to defuse tensions in Ukraine,
[**[planners]{.mark}** are finding the standoff reflects many of the
characteristics slated to make up the alliance's new strategic
concept]{.underline}.

[Analysts have long said]{.underline} the upcoming revision, up for
approval at the alliance's Madrid summit in late June, [[must consider
**defenses against**]{.mark} information warfare, **[cyber
attacks]{.mark}**, economic pressure and an overall increase in conflict
complexity that exceeds that of traditional military
operations]{.underline}.

**[[Much of that is happening right now]{.underline}]{.mark}**,

With NATO and U.S. written responses delivered to Moscow on Wednesday,
diplomacy is still running its course. Russia wants the alliance to
close the door to an eventual Ukrainian membership, a prospect
considered notional at best even within NATO.

Alliance officials, in turn, have touted the principle that Russia's
neighbor nations should be able to pick their own path in matters of
defense and security.

That idea doesn't sit well with the Kremlin, where President Vladimir
Putin is nursing dreams of restoring past Russian grandeur along ethnic,
religious and language lines, incorporating some of its neighbors,
according to Western analysts.

Still, the guns remained silent on mid-day Friday.

"I think the West is doing fairly well in managing a conflict that
cannot be deterred," said Hal Brands, a senior fellow with
Washington-based American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think
tank, and a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
Studies.

Brands said he believes Moscow's demands were so outrageous an eventual
armed confrontation was likely baked into them from the start. At this
point, he said, Putin may be more interested in continuing the pace of
escalation rather than agreeing to a diplomatic solution.

Deterrence has been the name of the game in Europe, however, where
countries are [[trumpeting **weapon shipments**]{.mark} large and small
[into **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline}, publicly scorning the one
government not going along: Berlin.

European countries still view their relationship with Russia through
bilateral lenses, said Rachel Rizzo, an analyst with the Atlantic
Council think tank. "That's why they are sidelined," she added,
referring to the fact that the European Union has no formal role in the
ongoing negotiations.

German government officials have defended their position of sending only
help that neither shoots nor explodes, like helmets, arguing a plus-up
in combat capabilities would be too insignificant to warrant undermining
Berlin's policy of hopeful hedging. But inside the country, some
analysts are arguing it's time to take a stance militarily.

The situation is emblematic for how disjointed Europe's position
continues to be on key defense issues, and how its biggest economic
player is finding itself isolated, said Christian Mölling of the
Berlin-based German Council on Foreign Relations.

"We have left a vacuum that the Americans are forced to fill once
again," he said.

### N/L -- No Tradeoff XT

The defense attaché system structure, mission, and manning have not
evolved with the changes of the last decade that require increased
levels of involvement in operational activity. [The primary attaché
function of [**observing and reporting** is]{.mark} often
[considered]{.mark} to be [in]{.mark} direct [conflict with **time** and
**energy** spent on other]{.mark}]{.underline} nonintelligence
[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark}. Intelligence and
[[**military-diplomatic activity** are **not zero-sum** competing
requirements]{.underline}]{.mark}. Narrow specialization by other DOD
elements has undermined the overall effectiveness of the military
attaché by reducing access to the host nation military. DOD
representation abroad should be the military attaché. Security
assistance and arms control would be better managed by trained attachés
with the requisite language skills, cultural knowledge, and regional
expertise. This approach would eliminate parochialism, reduce overhead,
streamline operations, and simplify bilateral coordination for the host
nation military.

Transformation of the military attaché corps begins at the higher
headquarters. The nature and function of a headquarters influence the
priorities of its subordinate elements. By eliminating stovepipe
organizations inside the U.S. Embassy in a consolidated DAO, the
combatant command headquarters will need to establish a
Politico-Military Directorate to manage, deconflict, and synchronize the
activities of military attachés. This transformed organization will
integrate national requirements for observing and reporting, supporting
operational and exercise taskings, security assistance, and strategy and
policy. More coherent policy and guidance will enable the military
attachés to apply the informational instrument of national power more
effectively. Making the director of this new organization within each
combatant command a general/flag officer with attaché experience will
brighten the promotion prospects for attaché duty and attract higher
quality officers.

**[[Realigned]{.mark} Mission [Priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}**

[**Security cooperation** and the war on terror have increased the
strategic importance of military attachés serving abroad.]{.underline}
Considering the extensive actions to coordinate the deployment of U.S.
forces against the Taliban in Afghanistan and support the
train-and-equip operation in Georgia, attachés provide a tremendous
value to the combatant commanders as operators and reporters.
Independent of transformation, [they have four main missions that
**[seamlessly blend]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Advising the Ambassador. Military attachés must know the host nation
military and strategic environment and be intimate with the U.S.
military's capabilities to support diplomatic and engagement measures.
The DATT provides advice on the full range of issues concerning regional
security, to include the attitudes and intentions of the host nation and
other nations engaged in regional activities. Finally, most DATTs also
serve as the U.S. defense representative charged with managing the
coordination of administrative and security matters of all DOD personnel
who fall under responsibility of the U.S. Ambassador. However, this
command relationship would be more effective with defense attachés
assigned to the same higher headquarters as the other DOD elements---the
combatant command.

[Representing DOD to the host nation]{.underline}. More than playing a
ceremonial role, military attachés are a highly visible symbol of the
Armed Forces. Especially critical in Eurasia where the Iron Curtain
allowed for little interaction with Americans during the Cold War, they
provide daily access to the host nation military regarding information,
capabilities, and strategies. They are generally contacted before all
others in a crisis. They serve a large public diplomacy function as
well.

[**[Reporting]{.mark}** conditions in the host country]{.underline}.
Attachés observe military conditions and developments. This [[is a
**continuous mission**]{.mark} that must be **[integrated into
all]{.mark} their [activities]{.mark}**. To succeed in security
cooperation, policymakers and decisionmakers require actionable
information]{.underline}. [It is often **attaché input** that **makes
for effective security cooperation** programs]{.underline}. During
periods of heightened tension and crisis, the attaché supports the
combatant commander by becoming his eyes and ears on the scene,
responding quickly to time-sensitive information requirements.
[Increasingly, military attachés serve as the conduit for sharing
information]{.underline}, especially in support of the war on terror.
Lastly, corruption remains a huge problem in Eurasia, and military
attachés provide oversight to monitor whether U.S. resources and funds
are used appropriately.

[**Managing security cooperation** programs]{.underline}. [Worldwide,
about half of all DAOs manage formal security assistance programs such
as]{.underline} the International Military Education and Training
([IMET]{.underline}) program [and]{.underline} Foreign Military
Financing ([FMF]{.underline}). [[In **activities unique to the former
Soviet Union**]{.mark}, the military attaché **[already]{.mark}** plays
a substantial role in **[coordinating]{.mark}** and executing the
[**extensive** **mil**]{.mark}**itary-to-[mil]{.mark}itary** programs,
[**exercises**, and **deployments**]{.mark}, [which
**frequently**]{.mark}]{.underline} dwarf **[[\[eclipse\] IMET and FMF
responsibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Even in countries with
security assistance offices, attachés still make recommendations on
**spending priorities**]{.underline} and approve IMET candidates.

Improved Manning Posture

Many DATT positions in remote regions are occupied by hard-working but
junior majors or senior first-time attachés with limited choices for
their terminal assignment. Lack of experience, language skills, rank, or
maturity is not a recipe for success. Many countries recognize the
strategic importance of their military attachés and send only their best
abroad. Because of the symbolic and ceremonial importance of rank, and
the requirement for experience and maturity, DATT billets should be
filled by colonels (or Navy captains) and represented by the service
that logically corresponds to that which dominates in the host country.
Most importantly, DAOs must have sufficient depth to permit attachés to
operate in multiple geographical locations.

To what degree is the United States able to resort to military power
without dependence on foreign governments? [The military attaché manages
the day-to-day bilateral relations for national policymakers and
combatant commanders]{.underline}. Transforming the attaché corps will
substantially improve the steady state military diplomacy that must be
conducted prior to any crisis. Changing the status quo will improve
interagency coordination and provide the combatant commander the
representation he needs within his area of responsibility. The military
attaché corps must adapt to the new strategic environment, which demands
skillful military diplomacy and knowledgeable professionals. Like the
Special Operations Soldiers who achieved fame in Afghanistan by
demonstrating their strategic value, military attachés have the
potential to provide significant returns in the area of military
diplomacy, while at the same time providing better reporting on a wider
range of important issues.

crises]{.mark}**]{.underline}, something that is virtually impossible
for the State Department, making the DOD often the lead actor in a
crisis.44 Regional combatant commands aggressively sought more resources
from Congress to conduct their own security assistance programs, giving
them added flexibility to work with partners in the field that their
State Department counterparts lacked.45 A Government Accountability
Office report found that 56 DOD security assistance programs do not
require any involvement from the State Department.46

The U.S. military must plan for a wide range of security cooperation1
missions, ranging from "normal" peacetime security cooperation
activities---such as building the long-term institutional and
operational capabilities and capacity of key partners and allies,
establishing and deepening relationships between the U.S. and partner
militaries, and securing access to critical areas overseas---to managing
quasi-operational efforts, such as managing foreign internal defense
within the overall foreign policy objectives of the United States.
Security cooperation, in the form of noncombat military-to-military
activities, is a useful part of the military's toolkit in conflict
prevention.2 Although [**[s]{.mark}ecurity [c]{.mark}ooperation**
[requires a relatively **small investment**]{.mark}]{.underline} with

Fortunately, those too often disjointed outcomes are now collapsing into
a far more synergistic endeavor [thanks to the N]{.underline}ational
[D]{.underline}efense [A]{.underline}uthorization [A]{.underline}ct [of

Chapter 16, Security Cooperation.

Congress redefined nearly everything DOD does with a foreign partner as
"security cooperation." That definition includes not just exercises and
information sharing---which is the traditional forte of operational
forces---but the Army's support of State Department-approved foreign
military sales cases, direct commercial sales, the training provided to
foreign partners at our schoolhouses and other programs as defined by
Title 22 Security Assistance, a State Department authority executed by
DOD.

MAJOR UPDATE

DOD publications updated as part of the National Defense Authorization
Act of 2017:

· Department of Defense Directive 5132.03, "DOD Policy and
Responsibilities Relating to Security Cooperation."

· Department of Defense Instruction 5132.14, "Assessment, Monitoring,
and Evaluation Policy for the Security Cooperation Enterprise."

· Department of Defense Instruction 5132.15, "Implementation of the
Security Cooperation Workforce Certification Program."

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency's comprehensive and expanded
mission, according to the agency's website, is "to advance U.S. defense
and foreign policy interests by building the capacity of foreign
partners in order to encourage and enable allies and partners to respond
to shared challenges." Important aspects of the agency's mission are the
tasks of managing and training the department's security cooperation
workforce and demonstrating the return on program investments, all while
continuing to perform their traditional core functions such as defense
trade and arms transfer, institutional capability building and
international education and training. Much of that mission passes to
each of the military services for execution through a variety of new
guidance like that for workforce certification.

CONVERGING EFFORTS

Understandably, [[the new]{.mark} **DOD** and **D**efense **S**ecurity
**C**ooperation **A**gency [**guidance** **resulted
in**]{.mark}]{.underline} the Army [**[rethinking
top-to-bottom]{.mark}** how it engages with foreign partners and manages
its workforce]{.underline}. Specifically, the materiel side of
international engagement, the Army security assistance enterprise, led
by DASA (DE&C), began to collaborate more closely with the operational
forces headed by the Army's G-3/5/7. That synergistic effort resulted in
the formulation of new Army guidance for the security cooperation
enterprise that more closely aligns with "General Order 2020-01,
Assignment of Functions and Responsibilities within Headquarters,
Department of the Army," and updated critical guidance in security
cooperation-related Army regulations.

[[This **refreshed**]{.underline}]{.mark} Army policy
marriage---[[operational **s**]{.mark}**ecurity

**effectiveness** of our]{.mark} security assistance
[efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Further, it]{.underline} ensures a
whole-of-Army approach, which [aligns plans that equip and train allies
and foreign partners to better]{.underline} contribute to the Army
Campaign Plan, the service's guidance for [allocating resources and
tasks to satisfy the DOD mandates]{.underline}.

NEW REGS

Army publications created or updated in response to DOD changes:

· Army Regulation 11-31, "Army Security Cooperation Policy."

· Army Regulation 12-1, "Security Assistance, Training, and Export
Policy."

· Army Regulation 5-22, "The Army Force Modernization Proponent System."

The Army validated this new relationship with a number of significant
administrative and strategy documents. In particular, those documents
include the designation of the Army chief of operations and DASA (DE&C)
as the Army's force modernization co-leads for security cooperation.
These partners also co-developed the Army Strategy for Allies and
Partners and three of its annexes: Implementation of Security
Cooperation with Allies and Partners, the Global Prioritization
Assessment and Country Specific Guidance.

As Part I of this study discussed, Army security cooperation activities
have aligned fairly well with what previous analyses have found
contribute to effectiveness in both security cooperation and
international development assistance. However, [[**across the U.S.
government**, **requirements** for]{.mark} more rigorous and systematic
[**AM&E** are **growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Army, with the rest
of DoD, must improve its ability to analyze and report the extent to
which its security cooperation activities are meeting their objectives.
As Part I makes clear, there is still much to be learned. As the United
States increases the scope of security cooperation, in terms of both
activity and partner types, planners will need to understand not only
what has been effective in the past but also how to identify lessons
from the broader range of partners the United States is engaging. Part
II of this study focuses on helping the Army develop an AM&E
implementation framework that will better link security cooperation
activities to their outcomes.

AM&E Developments---and Requirements---Are Accelerating

Within the past ten years, several developments have laid the
foundations for a more strategic and analytically rigorous approach to
security cooperation. As shown in Figure 4.1, [these developments have
arisen at several levels of government: Congress, the White House, OSD,
DSCA, and combatant commands (CCMDs), and within the Army]{.underline}
itself.

[First, an important impetus for DoD's recent efforts to improve the
security cooperation AM&E process has come from
**Congress**]{.underline}, some of whose members [are eager for the
department to improve its ability to track security cooperation resource
expenditures and demonstrate the effectiveness of security cooperation
programs in achieving DoD objectives]{.underline} at the national,
theater, or country level. In Section 1202 of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2016
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Congress mandated that DoD
work with the Department of State (DoS) to establish a strategic
framework for security cooperation "to guide prioritization of resources
and activities." Furthermore, it specified that one of the elements of
this strategic framework would be "a methodology for assessing the
effectiveness of Department of Defense security cooperation programs in
making progress toward achieving the primary objectives, priorities, and
desired end-states . . . including an identification of key benchmarks
for such progress."1 [[The]{.mark} FY **[2017 NDAA]{.mark}** reiterates
the]{.underline} previous NDAA's [call for a **security**]{.underline}
**\[Figure 4.1 OMITTED\] [cooperation AM&E framework]{.underline}**[,
but **goes further** by **requiring** an "**independent assessment** of
defense security cooperation programs."]{.underline}2

[Second, the **N**ational **S**ecurity **C**ouncil laid the groundwork
in 2013]{.underline} for a more integrated approach to security sector
assistance. [Directed primarily at DoS and DoD,
**[P]{.mark}**residential **[P]{.mark}**olicy **[D]{.mark}**irective
**[23]{.mark}** (Security Sector Assistance Policy) called for "a
deliberate and inclusive whole-of-government process that ensures
alignment of activities and resources with \[U.S.\] national security
priorities]{.underline}." Among other things, this meant ensuring
greater consistency between programs and objectives, fostering
transparency and coordination across U.S. government agencies, building
sustainable partner security capacity through comprehensive sector
strategies, being more selective in the use of security assistance
resources to achieve the greatest impact, and informing policy with
rigorous analysis, assessment, and evaluations. According to the
directive, this latter effort [would involve introducing "common
standards and expectations for assessing security cooperation
requirements" as well as "investing in monitoring and evaluation of
security sector assistance programs."]{.underline} Although the emphasis
was on greater standardization of AM&E policies and procedures
throughout the security assistance sector, the directive did indicate
that newly established "standards and data collection will take into
account the varying security and information environments where U.S.
programs operate."3

[Third, in 2016 OSD released Department of Defense Instruction
(**[DoDI]{.mark}**) Assessment, Monitoring and Evaluation Policy for the
Security Cooperation Enterprise, which provides guidance for a "whole of
DoD" approach to security cooperation AM&E]{.underline}. It asserts that
"accountability and learning are the primary purposes" of AM&E, and
highlights AM&E's importance in demonstrating security cooperation's
"returns on investment" so policymakers might "identify and improve or
eliminate ineffective initiatives" as well as garner evidentiary support
for policy and legislative proposals.4

[The DoDI specifies two main military service requirements in supporting
CCMD AM&E: (1) an initial (country-level) assessment of the security
cooperation environment and (2) an initial design document (IDD) for
"significant" security cooperation initiatives]{.underline}. "The
initial assessment provides an understanding of the context, conditions,
partner capabilities, and requirements immediately before the
implementation of security cooperation initiatives and other
activities." It informs initiative design and establishes a "baseline
against which to track progress." The IDD contains milestones and
measures that allow for performance monitoring and "independent and
rigorous evaluations" of initiative "relevance, effectiveness, and
sustainability."5 The IDD must also include a TOC.

[Within the terms of the DoDI, the **GCCs have the primary security
cooperation AM&E role**. Their responsibilities include (1) leading
initial assessment efforts, (2) orchestrating the assessment process,
(3) formulating IDDs for all significant initiatives, (4) monitoring all
significant initiatives, and (5) submitting to DSCA all initial country
assessments and IDDs for new security cooperation
initiatives]{.underline}.6 Based on the analysis in this report,
services play an important role in every step of the AM&E process,
particularly for the activities they implement directly. ASCCs play a
particularly important role linking Army security cooperation to GCCs'
initial assessment and IDD.

[In addition to issuing the DoDI, **OSD** has **encouraged** the
development of **AM&E** processes, for example, by highlighting the
importance of AM&E in various [other **guidance
doc**]{.mark}**ument[s]{.mark}** and hosting DoD-wide and **interagency
[workshops]{.mark}** to share best practices]{.underline}. These efforts
were accelerated and better integrated after OSD's establishment of a
Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Security Cooperation in 2015.
This office undertook several initiatives over the past two years,
supported by RAND's National Defense Research Institute, which focused
on institutionalizing best practices in security cooperation planning,
transparency, and AM&E.7

[Fourth]{.underline}, innovative concepts for using [technology to
improve data collection have allowed hundreds of U.S. security
cooperation practitioners around the globe to report on their activities
in more methodical and comprehensive ways]{.underline} and for
policymakers and program managers to provide more rigorous oversight.
[The creation of **security cooperation management information systems**
by the GCCs and other DoD organizations provided unprecedented platforms
for planning, resourcing, assessing, monitoring, and evaluating future
security cooperation AM&E efforts. These largely independent initiatives
have begun to coalesce in the form of a **comprehensive tool for
tracking DoD security cooperation activities and resources**:
**[G-TSCMIS]{.mark}**, whose development is being managed by DSCA (with
support from the Joint Staff) and is required to be used by all DoD
security cooperation activity managers]{.underline}. G-TSCMIS is still a
work in progress, and CCMDs face challenges getting all relevant
activities included in the system.8 Still, even when G-TSCMIS is fully
developed and widely used, it will not fulfill all the information
management needs required for effective security cooperation planning
and AM&E, which is why the CCMDs and other security cooperation
organizations continue to use their own systems.

In addition to overseeing the development of G-TSCMIS, DSCA has also
recently launched an initiative to formalize security cooperation
workforce competencies and associated experiential and training
requirements, which could eventually contribute to a larger pool of
qualified AM&E professionals within the security cooperation field.

[Fifth, the **[Joint Staff]{.mark}** has also played an important role
in attempting to improve and standardize security cooperation and
security force assistance (SFA) **[doctrine]{.mark}**, including with
respect to AM&E]{.underline}. Acknowledging the challenge of determining
the extent to which security cooperation activities have contributed to
U.S. objectives, the draft Joint Publication 3-20 provides guidelines
for three kinds of security cooperation assessments: operations
assessments (which focus on "are we doing the right things"), task
assessments (which focus on "are we doing things right"), and functional
assessments (which focus on "are we efficient [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
effective").9

[Sixth, OSD established theater campaign plans (**[TCPs]{.mark}**) for
CCMDs and campaign support plans for the military services as a way of
applying military planning techniques beyond traditional war plans to
incorporate more steady-state activities like security
cooperation]{.underline}. These plans allowed for a Secretary of
Defense--led analysis and discussion of security cooperation ends, ways,
and means that did not exist before. [More recently, the CCMDs have
begun to develop **[country plans]{.mark}** that [promise a **clear
auditing trail**]{.mark} between theater objectives and the means
(activities and resources)]{.underline} employed to achieve them that
involve U.S. allies and partner nations, given appropriate country
objectives and metrics as well as improved country-level data
collection.
