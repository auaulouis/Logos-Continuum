**[NATO's weakness stems]{.underline}** not only **[from dubious grand
strategy]{.underline}**, but also from its **[limited practical value.
Consider]{.underline}** the **[Libya]{.underline}**n Campaign. No longer
Europe's hour, **[NATO]{.underline}**'s member states aligned with one
another to **[persuade the U.S. to join]{.underline}** a **[dubious
campaigns]{.underline}**, where highfalutin rhetoric of human rights
masked realpolitik concerns for things like oil. The NATO tail ended up
wagging the American dog, and **[the U.S.]{.underline}** military **[had
to make up for key NATO deficiencies in logistics, electronic warfare,
surveillance]{.underline}**, and **[airpower]{.underline}**. In the end,
the NATO allies worked together and toppled Qaddafi, but **[the place
fell apart, jihadis exploited the ungoverned space]{.underline}**, a
U.S. ambassador was killed, and **[the campaign did little to contribute
to]{.underline}** U.S. or European **[security]{.underline}** interests.
A paragon of the managerial class, Hillary Clinton summed it up with her
callous retort: "What difference at this point does it make?" **[Libya
is not the exception. In Bosnia and Kosovo, NATO]{.underline}**'s
European members **[repeatedly]{.underline}** have
**[show]{.underline}**n **[very meager power projection capabilities. In
Afghanistan]{.underline}**, where many of our NATO allies assisted our
campaign after the 9/11 attacks under NATO's Article 5, **[individual
NATO participants often operated under wildly different rules of
engagement, limiting]{.underline}** the **[effectiveness]{.underline}**
of various nations' contingents. **[While there are common standards
across NATO]{.underline}**, ties of history and friendship, as well as a
common Western culture, **[it's not]{.underline}** so
**[clear]{.underline}** that **[these]{.underline}** factors **[have
ever overcome the divergent abilities of NATO members when called to
action]{.underline}**. In short, **[as it has expanded its membership
and its mission, NATO has become less effective]{.underline}**. And, to
the extent it is effective at all, the United States has always had to
do most of the work.

### AI/Tech Not Key

#### U.S. tech leadership is [high]{.underline} and [resilient]{.underline}.

**Levanon 2020**

\[Gad**.** Forbes manufacturing contributor. "Reports Of US Decline Are
Greatly Exaggerated." 08/27/20.
<https://www.forbes.com/sites/gadlevanon/2020/08/27/reports-of-us-decline-are-greatly-exaggerated/?sh=6253227b26f8>\]

**[Despite what many suspect is an eroding US global standing, 2020 may
be remembered as the year when the US became even more globally dominant
economically.]{.underline}** Why? The **[tech sector's share of the US
economy is much larger than in most countries]{.underline}**. And the
**[pandemic]{.underline}**-driven recession has **[greatly accelerated
the shift to online activity and digital transformation by businesses
and consumers, which would otherwise have taken years]{.underline}**.
That lead to **[faster growth in the global demand for
technology]{.underline}**. In addition, the **[US is especially dominant
in the tech industries that are likely to grow the fastest in the coming
years. Stock prices certainly support this story]{.underline}**. The S&P
500 is already above pre-pandemic highs despite the deepest recession in
80 years, and most of the stock prices' strength comes from tech sector.
The **[companies that have seen the strongest gains since the pandemic
focus on online shopping and payments, cloud computing services, cyber
security, business related software, social media, online advertisement,
and on-demand entertainment content.]{.underline}** Stock prices are
volatile and so are a treacherous guide for predicting the future, but
there is a plausible explanation for the large tech gains -- and why
they might last. \[Chart omitted\] There are **[several objective and
subjective reasons for why the US is so successful in technology
compared with other countries]{.underline}**. It has: 1The **[best
universities, which attract many of the best students from all over the
world]{.underline}** -- **[most of whom tend to stay in the US after
completing their studies]{.underline}** 2A **[large inflow of
experienced talent from other countries]{.underline}** 3 **[Unrivaled
access to venture capital]{.underline}** 4 **[Fluency in
English]{.underline}**, the **[global language in both business-dealing
and content]{.underline}** 5 An **[economy big enough to make achieving
scale relatively easy]{.underline}** 6 **[Silicon Valley]{.underline}**,
the home and heart of the tech revolution 7 A **[culture that welcomes
innovation and disruption and strongly encourages entrepreneurial
behavior]{.underline}** **[Given these factors, US tech leadership
should continue.]{.underline}** What about the competition? **[One
factor helping the US stand out is the weakness of the European tech
sector]{.underline}**. The market cap of the largest European tech
company, SAP SAP -0.3%, is about one-tenth of Apple AAPL +1.6%'s. In
other sophisticated industries like pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and
aircraft, European companies are strong competitors to their US
counterparts. Europe's relative technology weakness is perhaps as
unusual as the US strength in the sector, and is only reinforced by the
fact that US technology companies are already big players in European
economies. **[Most of the top tech companies from East
Asia]{.underline}** -- places like Japan, Taiwan and South Korea --
**[are in hardware and semiconductors manufacturing]{.underline}**. They
are serious competitors in these areas, but **[these technology sectors
are not growing as quickly.]{.underline}** No discussion of the future
of technology is complete without China. The **[Chinese internet
companies are huge and growing rapidly, but their ability to expand
beyond China and its periphery is questionable]{.underline}**. In almost
all sophisticated industries, **[Chinese companies are not yet major
players in Western economies]{.underline}**. Also, recent events suggest
that **[Western countries will be more cautious in dealing with China,
perhaps limiting its expansion]{.underline}**. The latest developments
with Huawei and TikTok are good examples. In addition, **[US companies
are slowly moving their supply chain elsewhere, further weakening
China.]{.underline}** So, the **[technology sector will perform well in
the next several years, benefiting countries that are strong in that
area]{.underline}**. The **[US, more than any other country, has a large
and successful tech sector that seems to be especially concentrated in
the fastest-growing tech industries.]{.underline}** What does this mean
for the US economy overall? First, it is important to mention that
**[the boost the US is getting from its tech sector has been larger than
what most other advanced economies have gotten for quite a
while]{.underline}**, and is one of the reasons the US has been growing
faster than them in recent years. But now, **[this trend is likely to
accelerate.]{.underline}** Here is some back of the envelope math for
the difference between the technology sector's contribution to GDP
growth in the US versus a typical advanced economy: Suppose in the US
the tech sector is 12 percent of GDP and is growing at 10 percent a
year. In another typical advanced economy the tech sector is 7 percent
of GDP and is growing at 5 percent a year. That means that the annual
contribution to GDP from the tech sector is 1.2 percent for the US
versus 0.35 percent for the other country. That is 0.85 percent faster
growth for the US every year. The net effect may be smaller because some
of the growth in tech companies come at the expanse of companies from
other sectors. But when the average annual GDP growth rate is 1.5-2
percent in advanced economies, even a 0.5 percent a year difference is
meaningful. The **[gains from the rapid growth in technology would
disproportionately go to tech companies' owners and
workers]{.underline}**. As most of these are high earners, this **[trend
is likely to increase income inequality]{.underline}**. But some of the
gains will spread more widely. After all, owners and workers, and the
companies themselves, spend a large share of their income in the
communities they live and operate in. It will also increase geographic
inequalities. Not surprisingly, within the US, areas close to Silicon
Valley benefited the most from the technology demand-surge. Between
2013-2018, among the 382 metro areas in the US, San Jose and San
Francisco metro areas had the fastest growth in personal income
per-capita. During that time, personal income per-capita in the San Jose
Metro area rose by 48 percent, more than twice as fast as the national
rate (22 percent). The surrounding metro areas, Napa, Santa
Rosa-Petaluma, Santa Cruz-Watsonville, Stockton, Vallejo, were all
ranked in the top 40. Seattle, another technology Hub, is ranked 13.
**[All of these data points add up to an enduring
strength]{.underline}**. **[Despite concerns about US's standing in the
world, its tech sector may keep it at the forefront of the global
economy in the foreseeable future.]{.underline}**

#### No AI arms race.

**Drezner 2019**

\[Daniel W. Drezner, international politics professor at Tufts
University. "What if AI is just BS?", Washington Post,
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/01/what-if-ai-is-just-bs/\]

The hard-working staff here at Spoiler Alerts has been attending way too
many conferences in the past half-year or so. Big conferences with
thousands of political scientists. Small conferences with just a few
political scientists. Posh conferences with lots of management
consultant types and I am the academic brought in for the sake of
intellectual diversity. There has been **[one constant]{.underline}**
running through all of them: **[people who want to sound savvy keep
talking about artificial intelligence as the New New
Thing]{.underline}**. This is what you read in the popular press as
well. There are lots of ways that AI could affect the social fabric:
there is the potential of lost jobs, or at least a radical reorientation
of what jobs would look like. There are the unexpected effects of
artificial intelligence, which I believe the sci-fi genre has tackled
with a great deal of enthusiasm. And **[for]{.underline}** my bailiwick
of **[international relations, there is a lot of talk about an AI "arms
race"]{.underline}** that could alter the balance of power in the
future. Are these people correct? I am legitimately unsure, but I
confess to wariness about claims of technological game-changers. All too
often, I hear colleagues reference **[AI]{.underline}** the way that
they would reference "globalization" or "Big Data" --- terms **[so
amorphous]{.underline}** that **[there is no consensus about the
definition]{.underline}**. On that question and many others, I strongly
recommend perusing Michael **[Horowitz's essay]{.underline}** in the
Texas National Security Review, which **[makes]{.underline}** some very
**[useful distinctions]{.underline}**. Horowitz **[points out that AI is
more of a continuum than a precise technology]{.underline}**. He also
acknowledges that **[the future of AI is far from clear]{.underline}**.
He writes, **["even experts disagree about]{.underline}** whether
artificial general intelligence of the type that could outpace human
capabilities will emerge in the short to medium term or **[whether it is
still hundreds of years away. AI experts]{.underline}** also **[disagree
about the overall trajectory of advances in AI."]{.underline}** For
Horowitz, one of the key questions is whether the engine of innovation
comes from the private sector (because of AI's utility as a general
purpose technology) or the defense sector (because of AI's utility for
the military). I have some skin in this game, because I wrote something
about technological change and international relations for the
centennial anniversary of the journal International Relations that was
just published. My interest is more in whether AI is a technology that
gets standardized pretty quickly, or whether it requires massive fixed
costs to develop properly. If it is the former, then industrial policies
do not matter much, because the technology will diffuse rapidly.
First-mover advantages might matter in terms of standard-setting but not
much else. If it is the latter, however, then industrial policy could
matter a great deal, with all sorts of unpleasant international
implications. Another problem that AI exemplifies is the ways in which
**[old metaphors are applied]{.underline}** to news technologies ---
sometimes **[inaccurately]{.underline}**. In the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, Heather Roff has an interesting essay on this very question,
in which she notes, "It would help matters if artificial intelligence
discussions were framed in an 'AI +' framework, because in many cases,
**[AI is merely a tool included in a system involving other functions or
capabilities. The news media should stop framing the global artificial
intelligence competition as an 'arms race.' This misrepresents the
competition going on among countries."]{.underline}** I am old enough to
remember all the times that a new technology was declared to be the New
New Thing. In the late 1980s, it was high-definition television. **[In
the 2000s, it was nanotechnology or biotechnology]{.underline}**. AI is
the big thing now, unless it is 5G. None of this means that AI is not a
significant technology. But it does mean that very often the **[people
proclaiming that are selling you something]{.underline}**.

### No Heg Impact

#### Liberal order is resilient -- no collapse.

**Mousseau 2019**

\[Michael James Mousseau, Political Science Professor at the Univeristy
of Central Florida, focuses on the link between economics and conflict,
PhD at Binghamton University. The End of War: How a Robust Marketplace
and Liberal Hegemony Are Leading to Perpetual World Peace, 44(1), Summer
2019, ProjectMUSE\]

**[Reports of the demise of the liberal order]{.underline}**, however,
**[are greatly exaggerated]{.underline}**. First, Hungary and Poland are
newly contractualist states. The sociological **[nature
of]{.underline}** economic **[norms]{.underline}** theory
**[means]{.underline}** that contractualist **[values should be more
firmly rooted in older]{.underline}** contractualist
**[societies]{.underline}** than in newer ones. **[This is corroborated
with]{.underline}** the natural experiment of **[Germany]{.underline}**:
in 1962 West Germany embraced contractualism (see table 1), but it was
only after 1991 that East \[End Page 191\] Germany could have become
contractualist, when massive investments from the Federal Republic
caused incomes in the marketplace to become higher than incomes
obtainable from status relationships. **[Today, Germany\'s populist
movement is]{.underline}** concentrated in the eastern part of the
country and **[is largely nonexistent]{.underline}** in the western
part,83 which corroborates the expectation that some newly
contractualist societies retain some of their status values even after a
generation of robust opportunity in the marketplace. **[Deeper changes
in values may not occur until generational cohorts initially socialized
into status or axial economies have passed on]{.underline}**. Second,
**[the electorates in]{.underline}** most of the
**[thirty-five]{.underline}** contractualist **[states]{.underline}**
listed in table 1 in 2010 **[have not experienced]{.underline}**
substantial **[increases in populist sentiment]{.underline}**. Italy\'s
Five Star movement is often called populist but largely because of its
anti-immigrant stance. Although an embrace of immigrants would seem
consistent with contractualist values, **[opposition to]{.underline}**
large numbers of **[immigrants is arguably]{.underline}** a
**[rational]{.underline}** response to what is essentially a huge
external shock that has intensified in recent years. **[Britons voted to
leave the E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion, but largely
**[because they believed they were being treated unfairly]{.underline}**
in it. The rejection of unfair terms of trade, whether perceived
correctly or not, is consistent with contractualist values. Third,
**[the strength of institutions far exceeds]{.underline}** that of
**[any one person, including the president of the United States. Liberal
values and institutions are rooted in]{.underline}** contractualist
economic **[norms and will not disappear]{.underline}** simply
**[because]{.underline}** some **[leaders choose not to abide by
them]{.underline}**. For instance, although Trump may want the United
States to withdraw from the North Atlantic alliance, this is not a view
shared by Congress and the American people. Even members of Trump\'s
administration have often restrained him in ways consistent with
contractualist values and institutions.84 In economic norms theory, the
only way the United States\' contractualist values could shift to status
or axial values would be through radical economic change. As mentioned
above, economics is ultimately at the mercy of politics, as an
influential coalition of rent-seekers could potentially collapse a
contractualist economy by failing to sustain the highly inclusive
marketplace or uphold the state\'s credibility in enforcing of
contracts. In recent years, the U.S. economy has begun tilting toward
rent-seekers, given the growing role of private money in electoral
campaigns and the increasing sophistication of rent-seekers \[End Page
192\] in masking their activities though the manipulation of public
opinion, including through their concentrated ownership of media
outlets. Such rentierism could precipitate a change in U.S. values if it
results in a retraction of the market substantial enough that newer
generations began to obtain higher wages in newfound status networks
than in the marketplace. In this way, the Trump phenomenon may reflect a
pathology in U.S. governing institutions; but at least so far, it
arguably has not extended to the American people. Most of Trump\'s
supporters seem to be drawn to him not for his expressions of status
values, but for his pledges to fight a \"rigged\" system and create
well-paying jobs. Whether or not Trump means what he says, many of his
supporters saw a vote for him as an act of protest against the
increasing corruption occurring in the United States, a clear
contractualist expression.85 Although a collapse of the U.S. economy and
transition to an axial or a status economy is always possible, the
feedback loop of popular insistence on economic growth and a highly
inclusive marketplace makes this unlikely. Aside from an external shock
(such as nuclear war or climate devastation), such a transition could
happen only if the rentiers somehow manage to remain in power long
enough to institutionalize a permanently underemployed underclass.
Fourth, even if the U.S. economy were to collapse and the United States
became an axial or a status power, the combined economic might of all
the other contractualist countries in the world is nearly twice that of
the United States. The soft power of the United States in world politics
lies not in its power to persuade, but in it being the largest of the
contractualist states, and in its willingness to provide the public good
of global security since the collapse of the pound sterling in late
1946. If the United States withdrew from its leadership role, the
remaining contractualist powers would fill the vacuum. None of them has
an economy relatively large enough to enable it to act as a natural
leader and principal provider of global security, but it is the
temperament of these states that they can easily form an international
organization to coordinate and act on their shared security interests,
even if some may choose to free ride. Fifth, **[current events need to
be viewed within a larger context]{.underline}**. Fernand Braudel
pinpoints the rise of the modern world economy as starting around the
year 1450 in northwestern Europe.86 The first contractualist economy
emerged more than two centuries ago. Since then, contractualist states
have \[End Page 193\] confronted numerous shocks and threats to their
systems, including the American Civil War, the Great Depression, two
world wars, and the Cold War. **[The present populist
mini-wave]{.underline}** and pathologies in U.S. democracy **[are mere
trifling episodes in a larger historical frame]{.underline}**.

#### No heg impact

**Fettweis 2017**

\[Christopher, Associate Professor of Political Science at Tulane
University, 5/8/17, "Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace," vol. 26,
no. 3, pp. 423-451\]

**[Even the most ardent supporters of the hegemonic-stability
explanation do not contend that US inﬂuence extends equally to all
corners of the globe.]{.underline}** The United States has concentrated
its policing in what George Kennan used to call "strong points," or the
most important parts of the world: Western Europe, the Paciﬁc Rim, and
Persian Gulf.64 By doing so, Washington may well have contributed more
to great power peace than the overall global decline in warfare. If the
former phenomenon contributed to the latter, by essentially providing a
behavioral model for weaker states to emulate, then perhaps this lends
some support to the hegemonic-stability case.65 During the Cold War, the
United States played referee to a few intra-West squabbles, especially
between Greece and Turkey, and provided Hobbesian reassurance to
Germany's nervous neighbors. **[Other, equally plausible explanations
exist for stability in the ﬁrst world, including the presence of a
common enemy, democracy, economic interdependence, general war aversion,
etc]{.underline}**. **[The looming presence of the leviathan
is]{.underline}** certainly among these plausible explanations, but
**[only inside the US sphere of inﬂuence]{.underline}**. Bipolarity was
bad for the nonaligned world, where Soviet and Western intervention
routinely exacerbated local conﬂicts. Unipolarity has generally been
much better, but whether or not this was due to US action is again
unclear. **[Overall US interest in the affairs of the Global South has
dropped markedly since the end of the Cold War, as has the level of
violence in almost all regions. There is less US intervention in the
political and military affairs of Latin America compared to any time in
the twentieth century, for instance, and also less
conﬂict]{.underline}**. Warfare in Africa is at an all-time low, as is
relative US interest outside of counterterrorism and security
assistance.66 **[Regional peace and stability exist where there is US
active intervention, as well as where there is not]{.underline}**. **[No
direct relationship seems to exist]{.underline}** **[across
regions]{.underline}**. If intervention can be considered a function of
direct and indirect activity, of both political and military action, a
regional picture might look like what is outlined in Table 1. These
assessments of conﬂict are by necessity relative, because there has not
been a "high" level of conﬂict in any region outside the Middle East
during the period of the New Peace. Putting aside for the moment that
important caveat, some points become clear. The great powers of the
world are clustered in the upper right quadrant, where US intervention
has been high, but conﬂict levels low. **[US intervention is imperfectly
correlated with stability]{.underline}**, however. Indeed, **[it is
conceivable that the relatively high level of US interest and activity
has made the security situation in the Persian Gulf and broader Middle
East worse]{.underline}**. **[In recent years, substantial hard power
investments]{.underline}** (Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq), **[moderate
intervention]{.underline}** (Libya), **[and reliance on
diplomacy]{.underline}** (Syria) **[have been equally ineffective in
stabilizing states torn by conﬂict]{.underline}**. **[While it is
possible that the region is essentially unpaciﬁable and no amount of
police work would bring peace to its people, it remains hard to make the
case that the US presence has improved matters]{.underline}**. In this
"strong point," at least, **[US hegemony has failed to bring
peace.]{.underline}** In much of the rest of the world, **[the United
States has not been especially eager to enforce any particular
rules]{.underline}**. Even rather incontrovertible evidence of genocide
has not been enough to inspire action. **[Washington's intervention
choices have at best been erratic]{.underline}**; **[Libya and Kosovo
brought about action, but much more blood ﬂowed uninterrupted in Rwanda,
Darfur, Congo, Sri Lanka, and Syria]{.underline}**. **[The US record of
peacemaking is not exactly a long uninterrupted string of successes.
During the]{.underline}** turn-of-the-century conventional **[war
between Ethiopia and Eritrea,]{.underline}** a high-level **[US
delegation]{.underline}** containing former and future National Security
Advisors (Anthony Lake and Susan Rice) made a half-dozen trips to the
region, but **[was unable to prevent either the outbreak or recurrence
of the conﬂict]{.underline}**. Lake and his team shuttled back and forth
between the capitals with some frequency, and President Clinton made
repeated phone calls to the leaders of the respective countries,
offering to hold peace talks in the United States, all to no avail.67
The war ended in late 2000 when Ethiopia essentially won, and it
controls the disputed territory to this day. **[The Horn of Africa is
hardly the only region where states are free to ﬁght one
another]{.underline}** today **[without fear of]{.underline}** serious
US **[involvement.]{.underline}** **[Since they are choosing not to do
so with increasing frequency, something else is probably affecting their
calculations]{.underline}**. **[Stability exists even in those places
where the potential for intervention by the sheriff is
minimal]{.underline}**. Hegemonic stability can only take credit for
inﬂuencing those decisions that would have ended in war without the
presence, whether physical or psychological, of the United States. **[It
seems hard to make the case that]{.underline}** the relative
**[peace]{.underline}** that has descended on so many regions **[is
primarily due to the]{.underline}** kind of heavy **[hand of the
neoconservative leviathan]{.underline}**, or its lighter, more liberal
cousin. Something else appears to be at work.

### A2 Pursuit Inevitable

#### Pursuit of heg isn't inevitable -- grand strategy moderates based on relative US power 

**Kitchen 20** (Nicholas, Department of Politics, University of Surrey,
Guildford, United Kingdom, "Why American Grand Strategy Has Changed:
International Constraint, Generational Shift, and the Return of
Realism", Global Affairs, Vol. 6) DB

**[From this review of the strategic postures of the last four US
administrations, it's striking the extent to which each defined itself
in contrast to what had come before: if the post-Cold War period really
was characterised by continuity, this certainly wasn't the image
incoming administrations had of themselves]{.underline}**. **[Rather,
they not only sought, but succeeded, in changing course: we can see
significant variation in both second order adjustments to the
instruments used to pursue US interests, and also third order shifts in
terms of how US interests ought to be constituted]{.underline}**. **[The
first two post-Cold War administrations differed in how they understood
the goal of primacy, and enacted second-order changes in the means by
which the United States pursued it]{.underline}**. But the last decade
has seen an even more fundamental rethinking in terms of the logics of
American foreign policy. Ben Rhodes' characterisation of the foreign
policy establishment as 'the Blob' points to the Obama administration's
claim to have recast American grand strategy in ways that explicitly
rejected what consensus there was between liberal internationalist
democrats and republican neoconservatives. **[That consensus revolved
around the idea that American leadership was indispensable in the world,
that hegemonic management should be activist, and that the continued
flourishing of the United States at home required liberal democratic
governance and open markets abroad]{.underline}**. **[The questioning of
this consensus reveals divergent ideas about both how the world works
and what policies are most likely to succeed, but also more
fundamentally about what it means for the United States to be
powerful]{.underline}** (Quinn & Kitchen, 2018). Whilst employing very
different ideas about the question of what constitutes American power,
**[both Obama and Trump's foreign policies might be cast as declinist,
in that they seek to respond to an international system that is less
permissive of the direct application of American power]{.underline}**
(Kennedy, 1992, pp. 239-240). **[Obama's response to perceived decline
might be characterised as politeness]{.underline}** (Quinn, 2011).
**[Reaffirming commitments to multilateral institutions, reinvigorating
alliance partnerships, and above all, seeking to steer clear of policy
choices that might further hasten decline -- the administration-endorsed
bumper stick was "don't do stupid shit"]{.underline}** (Rothkopf, 2014)
-- were all designed to slow the pace at which the United States'
unipolar position was inevitably eroding, and to extract greater returns
from structural power (Kitchen & Cox, 2019). **[Trump's response to
perceived decline is the opposite]{.underline}**, not least because in
his dystopic rhetoric Trump used decline as a political strategy, as Oz
Hassan highlights in this issue. In a thoughtful reflection on Kennedy's
Rise and Fall thesis in 1991, the Australian historian Neville Meaney
wrote that "no treatment of American decline is adequate which does not
face up to the problem of American nationalism and its impact on
American social psychology." (Meaney, 1991) **[It is not simply the
nationalist and reactionary character of Trump's rhetorical response to
decline: his mercantilism, alliance backsliding, and focus on great
power relations over institution-building has echoes of Nixon's foreign
policy in a former period of economic malaise and status
anxiety]{.underline}** (Cha & Seo, 2018). Indeed, **[the United States'
strategic approach during the course of the last decade has echoes of
American grand strategy in times when American power was less obviously
dominant]{.underline}**. **[Through the nineteenth and early twentieth
century, before Washington's post-war ascension to the position of
'leader of the free world', American foreign policy was steeped in
realism: geographically focused, cautious, and suspicious of grand
designs]{.underline}**. In this sense, the Cold War period is an
outlier, characterised by ideologically fuelled global ambition. **[Now
that the generation of foreign policy establishment that experienced the
Cold War is fading away, replaced by a younger coterie animated by the
damage caused by American adventurism in the post-Cold War period, the
cognitive frameworks of US foreign policy have changed]{.underline}**.
**[For all Trump's particular capriciousness, a sense of realism is
returning to the heart of American grand strategy]{.underline}**.
